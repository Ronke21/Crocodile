<text>The Mozarabic Rite (, , ), officially called the Hispanic Rite (, , ), and in the past also called the Visigothic Rite, is a liturgical rite of the Latin Church once used generally in the Iberian Peninsula (Hispania), in what is now Spain and Portugal. While the liturgy is often called &#x27;Mozarabic&#x27; after the Christian communities that lived under Muslim rulers in Al-Andalus that preserved its use, the rite itself developed before and during the Visigothic period. After experiencing a period of decline during the Reconquista, when it was superseded by the Roman Rite in the Christian states of Iberia as part of a wider programme of liturgical standardization within the Catholic Church, efforts were taken in the 16th century to revive the rite and ensure its continued presence in the city of Toledo, where it is still celebrated today. It is also celebrated on a more widespread basis throughout Spain and, by special dispensation, in other countries, though only on special occasions.

In addition to its use within the Catholic Church, the rite (or elements from it) has also been adopted by Western Rite Orthodox congregations and the Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church.

==History==
===Formation of liturgical rites===

Ritual worship surrounding the Eucharist in the early Church was not scripted with precise rubrics as is the norm today. One of the earliest known documents setting down the nature of Eucharistic celebration is the Didache, dating from 70–140 (see historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology). Few details are known of early forms of the liturgy, or worship, in the first three centuries, but there was some diversity of practice; Justin Martyr, however gave one example of early Christian liturgical practice in his &quot;First Apology&quot; (AD 155–157).

As Christianity gained dominance in the wake of the conversion of Constantine I early in the fourth century, there was a period of liturgical development as the communities emerged from smaller gatherings to large assemblies in public halls and new churches. This time of development saw the combination of embellishment of existing practices with the exchange of ideas and practices from other communities. These mutual processes resulted both in greater diversity and in certain unifying factors within the liturgy from the merging of forms throughout major cities and regions. The liturgies of the patriarchal cities in particular had greater influence on their regions so that by the 5th century it becomes possible to distinguish among several families of liturgies, in particular the Armenian, Alexandrian, Antiochene, Byzantine, West Syriac Rite and East Syriac Rite families in the East, and in the Latin West, the African (completely lost), Gallican, Celtic, Ambrosian, Roman, and Hispanic (Mozarabic) families. These settled into fairly stable forms that continued to evolve, but none without some influence from outside.

In the West, the liturgy in Roman Africa was lost as the Church there was weakened by internal division and then the Vandal invasion, and then was extinguished in the wake of the Islamic ascendancy. In Gaul, the fascination of the Franks with Roman liturgy led them to begin adopting the Roman Rite, a process that was confirmed and promoted by Charlemagne as an aid to imperial unity. 

===The emergence of the Hispanic Rite===

From 507, the Visigoths, who were Arian Christians, maintained their kingdom at Toledo. That there was already a distinct liturgical tradition in Hispania prior to their arrival is evidenced by the fact that the Hispanic liturgy lacks any Arian influence. Indeed, certain elements of this rite (e.g. the distinctive emphasis on &quot;Trinity&quot; as a title of address in many prayers, the recitation of the Creed in the liturgy) have been interpreted as a reaction to Visigothic Arianism.

Though reasonably tolerant, the Visigoths controlled episcopal appointments, which may have provoked the first extant expression of papal concern in Pope Vigilius&#x27;s letter to the bishop of Braga in 538, dealing with baptism, penance and reconsecration of churches. Among those sympathetic to Rome was Leander, archbishop of Seville, who had formed a friendship with Pope Gregory the Great while in Constantinople. Leander presided over the Third Council of Toledo in 589, during which King Reccared I formally brought the Visigoths into Catholicism. The same council also formally introduced the controversial &quot;Filioque&quot; clause into the Nicene Creed, which would later prove to be an impetus for the Great Schism of 1054. Reccared&#x27;s conversion marked the integration of Visigoths and Hispano-Romans into one liturgy.

It was under Visigothic aegis that the Hispanic liturgy reached its point of greatest development; new rituals, euchology, and hymns were added to the liturgical rites, and efforts were made to standardize Christian religious practices throughout the peninsula. Two main traditions emerged as a result of these processes: Tradition A from the northern territories and Tradition B from the south. Isidore, Leander&#x27;s brother and successor, presided over the Fourth Council of Toledo in 633, which established uniform chants for the Divine Office and the Eucharistic liturgy. Concerns over ritual practices were reflected in his &quot;De ecclesiasticis officiis&quot;.

One notable feature of the Hispanic Rite – specifically, the southern Tradition B – is the presence of Eastern (Byzantine) characteristics. The establishment of the short-lived Byzantine province of Spania in the south by Justinian I may have contributed to this influence; Leander&#x27;s stay in Byzantium might also have been another factor.

Further development occurred under the archbishops of Toledo during the mid to late 7th century: Eugenius II (646–657), his nephew and successor Ildefonsus (657–667), and Julian (680–690). This concluded the creative development of the Hispanic liturgy before the Umayyad conquest of 711.

===Under Muslim rule and the Reconquista===

The Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 checked the development of the Hispanic Rite. Although a band of Christians from the north asserted independence, eventually leading to the Reconquista, the majority of the Christian population and the religious hierarchy were situated in areas dominated by Muslims. Such Christians who lived under Moorish rule, and later came to adopt elements of Arabic culture while retaining their own, were termed Mozarabs. While the Islamic authorities accorded the Mozarabs dhimmi status (thus allowing them to practice their religion with certain restrictions), public displays of faith and the construction of new churches were prohibited, which limited the ability of the rite to develop naturally and perhaps even contributed to an attitude of conservatism. Nevertheless, as territories were taken back by Christians in the north, some Christians in the south fled to liberated areas and in certain cases even contributed to efforts at repopulation of abandoned towns, particularly in the Kingdom of León. These refugees continued to perform their liturgy and eventually to resume its development. Consequently, partially due to pressure from Rome, councils dedicated to the rite&#x27;s reform and development took place at León (1020), Coyanza (1055), and Compostela (1056).

As the Christian kingdoms of the north reconquered Hispania, the kings sought to re-establish connections with the rest of Christian Europe and the Papacy. Charlemagne&#x27;s efforts to impose the Roman liturgy as the standard in the Frankish realms at the 8th century made headway into the Catalan regions first during the 9th century, then eventually in the 11th century to the other reconquered northern realms. Unity in liturgical practice was strongly encouraged by Rome and after reconquest typically the Roman Rite was installed.
One factor for the spread of the Roman liturgy into Iberia was the alliances the Christian kings made with Frankish rulers and monks. King Sancho III of Navarre (1000–1035) and his son Ferdinand I of León (1035–1065) for instance were connected with the monastery of Cluny and developed the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela, which brought in thousands of French and northern European pilgrims and with them, their influences. Another factor was the suspicion that the Hispanic liturgy might be unorthodox or heretical. Certain Mozarab Christian theologians such as Archbishop Elipandus of Toledo (754/783–808?), during the course of their attempt to explain Christology in a way easily understood by Muslim authorities, have been accused of falling into Adoptionism (i.e. that Jesus was adopted by the Father as the Son of God). Though the other Mozarab bishops agreed with the consensus and condemned Elipandus&#x27; Christology, the specter of Adoptionism contributed to the assessment that the Hispanic Rite was of dubious orthodoxy, especially due to Elipandus&#x27; use of quotations from the liturgical tradition in support of his teachings.

It was due to these suspicions that in 924, Pope John X sent a papal legate named Zanello to investigate the Rite. Zanello spoke favorably of the Rite, and the Pope gave a new approbation to it, requiring only to change the Words of Institution to that of the Roman one. Spanish clergy gradually started to use the Roman formula, though there is no evidence whether it was done consistently.

By the late 11th century, during the papacies of Nicholas II (1059–1061), Alexander II (1061–1073), Gregory VII (1073–1085), and Urban II (1088–1099), however, the Hispanic liturgy was increasingly marginalized in favor of the Roman Rite. (Attempts to impose the Roman form of worship in Milan, where the Ambrosian Rite is practiced, also occurred around this time.) Alexander II, for instance, effected the establishment of the Roman liturgy in Aragon through the papal legate Hugh Candidus, whose work also resulted in its spread to Navarre. While the Council of Mantua in 1067 declared the Hispanic Rite to be free of heresy, King Sancho Ramírez of Aragon was in favor of the change.
In a similar vein, Gregory VII insisted upon Roman use in Castile, despite considerable opposition. Legend says that when King Alfonso VI of Castile, who was well disposed to the Roman Rite and to the Cluniac Reforms, conquered Toledo in 1085, he tried to ascertain which rite was superior through a number of ordeals, one of which involved throwing one book for each rite into a bonfire. In one version, the Hispanic book was little damaged whilst the Roman one was consumed; another version has both books survive – the Hispanic book was unscathed while the Roman one was ejected from the fire.

Despite the outcome of these ordeals, the king insisted on the introduction of the Roman Rite; a council convened by Alfonso at Burgos in 1080 led to the official abandonment of the Hispanic Rite. As part of his program to systematically replace the Old Hispanic liturgy with the Roman one in his domain, Alfonso installed Cluniac monks in the monasteries of Silos and San Millán de la Cogolla and French prelates such as Bernard of Sédirac in Toledo and other cities of his realm. While the king made concessions to the Mozarab community of Toledo by allowing six parishes within the city to continue the use of the rite (the churches of San Sebastián, San Torcuato, Santas Justa y Rufina, San Lucas, San Marcos, and Santa Eulalia), Mozarab church officials could not become canons of the cathedral or take on roles of authority (such as the episcopacy) unless they began to celebrate the Roman Rite exclusively. This led to a diminishment in the ranks of Mozarabic clergy, so that by the mid-15th century there were few priests to minister to the community and fewer still who could read the Visigothic script used in the ancient liturgical books. Lay Mozarabs themselves increasingly began to integrate with the &quot;Latins&quot; (i.e. adherents of the Roman Rite) and started leaving Toledo for other areas, so that the number of Mozarabs remaining in the city from the 11th century on were numerically too small to sustain the six parishes allowed to continue the performance of the old rite.

===Preservation, decline, and revival===

Despite the factors that threatened the Hispanic Rite&#x27;s survival, there were also overriding factors that contributed to its preservation, which are linked to the same factors working against the rite.

*The Moorish conquest contributed to a conservative stance on the part of those who remained Christian, with efforts being made to preserve the liturgy as authentically as possible. Manuscripts written in the Visigothic script were copied and recopied by trained scribes in the Mozarab community; indeed, the oldest extant manuscripts for the rite come from the period just before the end of the Islamic era in Toledo.
*Efforts at imposing the Roman Rite in the reconquered areas led Mozarabs to compile their manuscripts in a form that would be acceptable to Roman authorities. When Hugh Candidus raised the issue of the rite&#x27;s orthodoxy to Ferdinand I, a compilation of Mozarabic manuscripts were sent along with a commission of bishops to Alexander II, who approved of the rite, thus granting it a brief reprieve until the Council of Burgos in 1080.
*Alfonso VI&#x27;s desire to impose the Roman Rite in his realms was mitigated by the agreement (&quot;fuero&quot;) he made with the Mozarabs of Toledo, in which the Mozarabs, in exchange for cooperating with the king in the reconquest of other territories, apparently asserted their privileges and extended these to the continued celebration of their ancestral liturgy, which was seen as an integral part of Mozarabic identity.

Although there is evidence of Mozarabic communities outside Toledo that continued to preserve Hispanic liturgical practices well into the 13th century, in Toledo itself both the community and the rite underwent a period of slow decay. The Roman Rite became so widespread that it was introduced even into the Mozarabic parishes (partly in response to the influx of Roman parishioners in these churches), so that the old rite was only used for certain special days, and even then in a corrupted form based on old and imperfectly understood manuscripts. Intermarriage with adherents of the Roman liturgy and the gradual integration of Mozarabs into mainstream society also contributed to the decline of parishioners in the surviving Mozarabic churches, which became impoverished as a result, leading to an exodus of clerics to Roman parishes.

While Mozarabic clergymen were obligated to abandon the Hispanic liturgy in order to receive ecclesiastical appointments, such clerics who shifted from Hispanic to Roman soon began to leave their mark on the Roman liturgy as performed in the cathedral of Toledo, leading to the creation of the &quot;Missale Mixtum Toletanum&quot;, which shows Mozarabic influences (such as the inclusion of local saints in the calendar), in the 15th century.

====Early attempts at revival====

There were a number of major attempts in reviving the decrepit Mozarabic Rite during the late medieval period. At the end of the 13th century, Archbishop Gonzalo Pérez Gudiel of Toledo (1280–1299), a Mozarab by blood, was concerned enough about the grave circumstances of the rite to entrust archdean Jofré de Loaysa with the renewal of the Mozarabic clergy and the copying of new liturgical books, giving new life to the Mozarab community and its rite.

In 1436, Juan Vázquez de Cepeda, bishop of Segovia, left in his will benefices for the creation of a chapel and center of Mozarabic studies in his villa at Aniago near Valladolid. He claimed that the Hispanic Rite was suffering from neglect and that those charged with its celebration in Toledo had forgotten how to perform the chants and liturgy in the correct manner. Unfortunately, due to insufficient funds as well as a lack of connection to any living Mozarab community, the foundation lasted for only five years before passing into the hands of the Carthusian Order.

The continued deterioration of the rite was also a matter of concern for Archbishop Alonso Carrillo of Toledo (1446–1482). Calling together a synod at Alcalá de Henares in 1480, Carillo decried the decadence that had befallen the rite due to the fact that the benefices destined for its celebration had been assigned to clerics with no real knowledge of or uninterested in the rite. He attempted to rectify the situation by forbidding the giving of benefices to ignorant clergymen and insisted that the rite be celebrated by knowledgeable ones. These actions, among others, laid the groundwork for Cardinal Jiménez de Cisneros&#x27;s reform in 1500–1502.

In 1484, Carillo&#x27;s successor, Cardinal Pedro González de Mendoza (1482–1495), ordered that the Mozarabic parishes were to be respected as free institutions, and attempted to curb the decline of these parishes by limiting the incursions of Roman parishioners into these churches, as well as the exodus of Mozarabs (and their taxes) to wealthier Roman parishes. The Mozarabic clergy sought papal confirmation of Mendoza&#x27;s decree and obtained it from Pope Innocent VII in the bull &quot;Fiat ut petitur&quot;. Despite this papal intervention, the Mozarabic parishes and their liturgy continued to decline so that by 1500, the number of Mozarabic Christians within the city of Toledo were reduced to a total of six divided between three parishes.

====Cardinal Cisneros&#x27;s reforms====

Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros succeeded Mendoza as archbishop of Toledo after the latter&#x27;s death in 1495. It is due to his efforts that the Hispanic/Mozarabic Rite survived down to the present day.

During a visit to the cathedral&#x27;s library in 1497, Cisneros was said to have been shown ancient Mozarabic liturgical manuscripts. He was so impressed that he ordered these taken to his personal library in order to examine them more closely. It is likely that this occasioned his decision to make known and available to scholars and others the texts of the Hispanic liturgy and Divine Office. To facilitate this he had them published by what was then a new technology: the printing press.

The first printed Mozarabic missal, the &quot;Missale Mixtum secundum regulam beati Isidori&quot;, appeared in 1500, followed two years later by a breviary (the &quot;Breviarium secundum regulam beati Isidori&quot;). The preparation of the missal&#x27;s text was the work of canon Alfonso Ortiz, who had already begun work on Mozarabic codices under Cisneros&#x27; predecessor Cardinal Mendoza, and three Mozarabic priests: Alfonso Martinez Yepes (Santa Eulalia), Antonio Rodrigues (Santas Justa y Rufina), and Jeronimo Gutiérrez (San Lucas).
In the missal&#x27;s preface, Ortiz lays out the five general norms underlying the reform: the identification of extant manuscripts, the license to edit and rewrite according to the original style, the excision of material deemed late or inauthentic, the formatting of the text in a logical manner, and the printing of the books in a readable form.

The resulting missal and breviary were not critical editions in the modern sense. Rather than being authentic representatives of the Hispanic tradition, later liturgists have found the books to be more of a combination of material found in different Mozarabic manuscripts, with gaps being filled in by invented services based on precedent set by earlier services and borrowings from the Roman liturgy (e.g. the preliminary prayers for the Mass, Roman feasts such as Trinity Sunday and Corpus Christi). The content of the printed missal and breviary is so inconsistent that Eugene de Robles, who wrote on the Mozarabic liturgy during the 17th century, considered the label &quot;Mixtum&quot; to be a reference to the mixed-up content.

In between the publication of the missal and the breviary, Cisneros instituted a chapel in the cathedral&#x27;s cloister with a college of thirteen priests who were to conduct a daily celebration of the Mozarabic liturgy. The chaplains of the Capilla Mozárabe (also known as the Corpus Christi Chapel) were to be of good character, well versed in the recitation and singing of the Mozarabic liturgy. In addition to these thirteen chaplains, a sacristan (who was also required to be a priest), assisted by two altar boys (&quot;mozos&quot;, &quot;monaguillos&quot;, or &quot;clerizónes&quot;), were to assist in the liturgy. The foundation of the chapel was approved by Pope Julius II on 20 September 1508, and the first Mozarabic Mass was held therein in 15 July 1511. Similar institutions dedicated to the preservation of the Hispanic liturgy were founded in other cities during the same century such as the Capilla de San Salvador (a.k.a. the Capilla de Talavera) in the Old Cathedral of Salamanca or a church in Valladolid dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, but these later fell into decline or became extinct.

The resulting liturgical books reflected Cisneros&#x27;s plan of reform including the selection of the texts and order of worship of Tradition B, which came to be attributed to Isidore of Seville. It seems this choice was made based on Isidore&#x27;s status in the Catholic Church as a whole as well as the interests of Cisneros and Ortiz to stress the antiquity of Spanish literary works. Thus Isidore is given pride of place in the colophon to the titles of the missal and breviary, which reads &quot;secundum regulam beati Isidori&quot;.

====Andrés Marcos Burriel====

The form of the Mozarabic liturgy as contained in the missal and breviary edited by Ortiz under Cardinal Cisneros&#x27;s patronage soon became the predominant version of the rite and provided the basis for new editions published in the 18th century. Because of the prevailing assumption that Ortiz had simply printed the contents of the ancient liturgical books, the existence of his editions caused scholars to neglect the actual manuscripts of the rite.

The first scholar to attempt a thorough analysis of the Mozarabic liturgical codices was the Jesuit polymath Andrés Marcos Burriel (1719–1762) in the mid-18th century, who had noticed discrepancies between the printed editions and the manuscripts. After being appointed as the director of the short-lived Royal Commission on the Archives by Ferdinand VI in 1749, formed by the government to obtain evidence for the royal patronage of church benefices in Spain, Burriel took advantage of his position to research the ancient manuscripts of the Hispanic Rite in Toledo&#x27;s cathedral library with the help of paleographer Francisco Xavier de Santiago Palomares (1728–1796), who made copies of the texts. The abrupt end of the Commission in 1755 and the rise of the anti-Jesuit Ricardo Wall as prime minister eventually put a stop to Burriel&#x27;s study. As he never published the results of his liturgical research during his lifetime, they went unnoticed until the 20th century; even today, most of his papers on the Hispanic liturgy have largely remained unexplored.

====Minor reforms under Cardinal Lorenzana====

Cardinal Francisco Antonio de Lorenzana became archbishop of Toledo in 1772 after serving as the archbishop of Mexico City (1766–1770). During his time in Mexico, Lorenzana showed an interest in the rite, which led to the publication of the &quot;Missale Omnium Offerentium&quot; in 1770. After his return to Spain he then published a new edition of the breviary under the title of &quot;Breviarium Gothicum&quot; in 1775 and made improvements to the cathedral&#x27;s Capilla Mozárabe. After Lorenzana went to Rome at the request of Pope Pius II, he then began a new edition of the missal (the &quot;Missale Gothicum secundum regulam beati Isidori Hispalensis episcopi&quot;) that was completed and published at his expense in 1804, the year of his death. Due to his death and various political difficulties of the time, the &quot;Missale Gothicum&quot; did not reach the chapel in Toledo until around 1898, and even then only after much effort by the chaplains. Parts of the original 1804 edition were lost after 1936, only to be rediscovered in a cabinet in 1975.

Lorenzana&#x27;s motivation was apparently to assert the Hispanic cultural heritage as encased in the Mozarabic liturgy, as well as to replace the then-antiquated Latin-Gothic typeset of the Cisneros edition. He was influenced in this endeavor by the scholarly edition of the &quot;Missale Mixtum&quot; published by Jesuit Alexander Lesley (1694–1758) in 1755, which both revealed grammatical and orthographic errors in the Latin and put the authenticity of some of the prayers therein into question. Using Lesley&#x27;s work as a base, Lorenzana assigned Faustino Arévalo the task of re-editing the breviary and missal, using various texts and codices available in order to make corrections to the text, resulting in some of the material identified as Ortiz&#x27;s original creations being relegated to an appendix. While Lorenzana&#x27;s reforms were not extensive, the publication of new books facilitated an updated celebration of the liturgy in the Mozarabic chapel and parishes.

===Later history===

In 1553, Pope Julius III regulated mixed marriages between Mozarabic and Roman Christians with the ruling that the children were to follow the rite of the father, but if the eldest daughter of a Mozarab married a Roman, she and her husband might choose the rite to which she and her children should belong, and if she became a widow she might return to the Mozarabic Rite, if she had left it at her marriage. This rule remained in force up until the early 20th century.

In 1570, Pope Pius V issued the bull &quot;Quo primum&quot; which made the use of the Tridentine form of the Roman liturgy obligatory throughout the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, except where there existed a different liturgy of at least two hundred years&#x27; standing. As the Hispanic liturgy is of considerable antiquity, it was counted as an exemption.

In 1842, all the Mozarabic parishes in Toledo except two (Santas Justa y Rufina and San Marcos) were suppressed, and their parishioners were added to those of the two surviving parishes. In 1851, the chaplains of the Capilla Mozárabe were reduced from thirteen to eight, but the continuance of the above two parishes was provided for. Whereas the Hispanic liturgy was still practiced in these two parishes at the time, by the early 20th century, the only place where the rite was performed on a regular basis was in the Capilla Mozárabe in Toledo; even at the Capilla de Talavera in Salamanca the rite was only celebrated once or twice a year.
The dawn of the 20th century saw an intensification of studies of the rite and the publication of its manuscript sources. In response to the encouragement given by the Second Vatican Council in &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot; to renew other rites as well as the Roman, the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo Marcelo González Martín set up a commission to revise the liturgical books of the rite. Between 1988 and 1995, the two-volume &quot;Missale Hispano-Mozarabicum&quot;, followed by the lectionary (the &quot;Liber Commicus&quot;, also in two volumes) and a vernacular (Castilian) version of the Ordinary of the Mass appeared, with the required approval of the Spanish Episcopal Conference and confirmation by the Holy See. The revision consisted in eliminating extraneous elements and distortions which had been introduced in the 1500 edition and the integration of all the contributions of ancient sources from both Hispanic traditions. The new edition of the liturgical books facilitated the occasional or relatively regular celebration of the rite.

====Current status====
The Hispano-Mozarabic Rite is still celebrated daily in the Capilla Mozárabe. Additionally, all the churches of Toledo annually celebrate this rite on the Mozarabic Feast of the Incarnation on 18 December, and on the feast day of St. Ildefonsus of Toledo on 23 January. The two surviving Mozarabic parishes in the city now have about two hundred families in an association of those claiming historical observance of the rite. The rite is also used on certain days each year in the Capilla de Talavera in Salamanca and every Tuesday in a monastery of Poor Clare Sisters in Madrid.

Outside of Spain, the rite has also been celebrated in the Vatican four times to date. In October 1963, Mass according to the rite was celebrated in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica during the Second Vatican Council in front of all the participants. Pope John Paul II performed the Hispanic liturgy in May 1992 (the Feast of the Ascension) on occasion of the promulgation of the revised missal and Lectionary and again in December 2000, during the end of the Great Jubilee. The Mozarabic Mass was once again said in St. Peter&#x27;s in 2015 by Archbishop Braulio Rodríguez Plaza of Toledo.

== Origins and connections to other rites ==
There is evidence that the Hispano-Mozarabic rite is tied to the Gallican family of rites, given common points of construction. Indeed, an anecdote about Charles the Bald relates that he had priests sent from Hispania so that he could experience the ancient Gallican liturgy and an edict of the Fourth Council of Toledo (633) prescribes a single order of worship for all of Iberia and Gaul.

While a connection with the Gallican liturgies is usually noted, there is no common agreement among scholars and authors regarding the exact origin of the Hispanic liturgy. Philip Schaff (1884) argues for an Eastern element in both Gallican and Hispanic rites, while Henry Jenner (1911) quotes Dom Marius Férotin O.S.B., who writes that the framework of the Hispanic liturgy is from Italy or Rome, while various details such as hymns are from Iberia, Africa, and Gaul. Jenner states that there is no extant concrete information about the Old Hispanic liturgy prior to the end of the 6th century, a point echoed by Fernand Cabrol (1932). Cabrol lists several liturgical points of Eastern origin (e.g. the place of the Diptychs, the Kiss of Peace, and the Epiclesis) while indicating liturgical commonalities to the entire West (including Rome and Gaul) and some customs which he believed antedate those of Rome. Archdale King, in a similar vein to Férotin&#x27;s theory, postulated that the Gallican and Mozarabic liturgies are related to the Roman and may have developed from an &quot;original&quot; liturgy of Rome. Josef Jungmann, who rejected this idea, nevertheless acknowledged similarities among all three rites.

The more common theory at present sees Roman Africa as the origin of both Hispanic and Gallican rites, with influences from Italy and the East. Raúl Gómez-Ruiz (2014) expresses a more cautious view, noting that while the two liturgies may well share a common origin, &quot;it is not clear what that root was.&quot; The Eastern elements in both rites are now often interpreted as witnessing to later popular liturgical migrations and borrowings rather than to some ancient genesis.

==Manuscript traditions==

Dom Jordi Pinell O.S.B. (d. 1997), the president of the commission charged with the revision of the rite&#x27;s liturgical books in 1982, identified two distinct traditions represented in the ancient liturgical manuscripts of the Hispanic Rite: Tradition A, which is represented by the majority of the manuscripts and evinces the liturgical uniformity sought in the northern provinces of Tarraconensis and Carthaginensis, and the minority Tradition B, exemplified by manuscripts apparently conserved by Mozarab immigrants to Toledo from Seville (the metropolitan see of Baetica in the south). The two traditions, although having many common texts, do not often coincide in their order and distribution. In addition, they exhibit substantial differences in the structure and euchology of the Mass and Divine Office and feature different systems of biblical readings.

Pinell linked the manuscripts recopied in Toledo by the two parishes of Santa Eulalia and Santas Justa y Rufina to these two traditions. Scholars hold that three of the six Mozarabic parishes in the city – Santa Eulalia, San Lucas, and San Sebastian – were associated with Tradition A, which was (erroneously) identified in later tradition with St. Leander of Seville, while the other three parishes – Santas Justa y Rufina, San Marcos, and San Torcuato – were associated with Tradition B, attributed to St. Isidore. He dated the Tradition A manuscripts of Santa Eulalia from the 8th to the 12th centuries, while the Tradition B codices linked with Santas Justa y Rufina were dated to the 10th to 12th centuries. Pinell speculated that the surviving texts (dated to the 14th–15th centuries) were copied from earlier manuscripts; for him, this late date implies that the liturgy was maintained with greater zeal in Santas Justa y Rufina, whereas all the other parishes had more or less abandoned their ancestral liturgy.

Of the two traditions, Tradition A is considered to be the more organized of the two, while Tradition B is less developed and combines evolution and corruption of the northern tradition. Pinell surmised that Tradition A was the indigenous Toledan liturgy, while Tradition B was imported by Mozarabs who immigrated to the city from southern Iberia in the 12th century, after the reconquest of Toledo.

Other scholars proposed other explanations regarding the manuscript traditions. For instance, &quot;contra&quot; Pinell&#x27;s theory that Tradition B is from Seville, José Janini considered it to be a local Toledan usage. Anscari M. Mundó (1965) argued that all the manuscripts are much later and date at earliest from the 11th century. Hornby and Maloy (2013) cautions that due to the influx of refugees from Muslim Iberia to Toledo, &quot;it cannot be automatically assumed that the surviving manuscripts are witnesses to a long tradition of Toledan practice. What is certain is that they represent Toledan Mozarabic practice after the reconquest.&quot; Also, while southern Christian immigration into Toledo would explain the practice of two distinct liturgical traditions there, the immigrants would not have all originated from the Seville region.

The reforms of Cardinal Cisneros in 1500 employed only Tradition B manuscripts for the compilation of the &quot;Missale Mixtum&quot; (and at least one of Tradition A that was similar in some ways to Tradition B). Similarly, Lorenzana&#x27;s reform was based on Tradition B texts available to him. Texts from Tradition A came to light only as a result of scholarly research in the 19th century. Eventually, texts from both traditions were incorporated into the current Mozarabic missal.

== Features ==
The Mozarabic liturgy is longer in duration than that of the Roman Rite. Imagery and ceremony are used extensively. The Breviary has a short and uncomplicated extra office (session of prayer) before the main morning office.

The Mozarabic Rite was the first to use ashes within the liturgical celebrations of the Church. Ashes were used prior to the Mozarabic Rite, but this was done outside of liturgical events, e.g., marking people for penance.

Extensive use is made of responsories between the celebrant (priest) and faithful during the Mozarabic Mass, including during the &quot;Confiteor&quot; (prayer of confession of guilt for sin), which is quite different from that in the Roman Rite.

Isidore of Seville in his writings made reference to the &#x27;seven prayers&#x27; of the Mozarabic Mass. These are the seven major variable liturgical texts which constitute the essential prayer formulas said by the celebrant in the Mozarabic liturgy of the faithful, namely: 
#The &quot;Oratio Missae&quot; or Prayer of the Mass, an opening prayer making reference to the feast being celebrated and in general character much like the Roman Collect. 
#The Prayer after the Names, said immediately after the recitation of the names of the faithful, living and dead, who are being prayed for. 
#Prayer for Peace, said immediately before the kiss of peace. 
#The &quot;Illatio&quot; corresponding to the Roman Preface and most frequently the longest part of the Mozarabic eucharistic prayer. 
#The Post-Sanctus, the part of the Mozarabic eucharistic prayer connecting the Sanctus with the institution narrative. 
# The Post-Pridie, the concluding portion of the eucharistic prayer including the anamnesis with its prayer of offering, the epiklesis, (when either or both of these are present) and the final doxology. 
#The Lord&#x27;s Prayer, with its variable introduction and fixed embolism and concluding clause.

There was no fixed &quot;anaphora&quot; or Eucharistic prayer in the Mozarabic rite of Mass, which permitted a fair degree of extemporaneous flexibility. When the Mozarabic rite was given a new lease on life in 1500, the Roman words of institution, the key words that Jesus used at the Last Supper, were required. Originally, the Mozarabic words of institution were from St. Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians (11:24), with the formula for the consecration of the wine being a combination of 1 Corinthians 11:25, Luke 22:20, and Matthew 26:28. These were the words written on the (old) Mozarabic Missal, though the Roman formula was included as a footnote in the Missal and was used in actual practice in place of the old Spanish formula (note, however, that it was reinstituted by the modern Mozarabic Missal).

Some Eucharistic prayers are addressed to Christ rather than to God the Father. After the consecration of the bread and wine (see Eucharist), as the Creed is being chanted, the host (the real presence of Christ under the species of bread) is broken into nine pieces, each representing a facet of Christ&#x27;s life on earth, seven of which are arranged in a cross on the paten. After a variable introduction the Lord&#x27;s Prayer was said by the celebrant alone, with everyone else responding &quot;Amen&quot; to each petition, except for the petition for daily bread, for which the response is &quot;For you are God&quot; and everyone concluding the final petition, &quot;but deliver us from evil&quot; with the celebrant.

== Influence on other rites and churches ==

The Mozarabic Rite has been of interest to non-Catholic communions as well. For example, in the 1880s the Anglican Communion examined the Mozarabic rite for ideas about making their own liturgy more inspiring, and at present the Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church employs it for the celebration of all sacraments.

The Spanish custom of &quot;las arras&quot;, when the bridegroom gives his bride thirteen coins after exchanging vows, has its origins in the Mozarabic rite and is still practised in former Spanish colonies in Latin America and in the Philippines, as well as Hispanic Catholic parishes in the United States and Canada.

<text>The East 180th Street station (originally East 180th Street–Morris Park Avenue station) is an elevated express station on the IRT White Plains Road Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of East 180th Street and Morris Park Avenue in the West Farms and Van Nest neighborhoods of the Bronx, it is served by the 2 and 5 trains at all times.

The East 180th Street station was built by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) under the Dual Contracts and opened in 1917 as part of an extension of the White Plains Road Line to East 219th Street–White Plains Road. The 180th Street station of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway (NYW&amp;B) is immediately adjacent to the IRT station. When the NYW&amp;B went bankrupt in 1937, a portion of the main line was converted into the IRT Dyre Avenue Line, and the NYW&amp;B platforms were abandoned after the Dyre Avenue Line was connected to the White Plains Road Line in 1957. The original NYW&amp;B station house remains extant and is the station&#x27;s main exit and entrance.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

The New York, Westchester and Boston Railway (NYW&amp;B), an electrified commuter line, opened on May 29, 1912, connecting White Plains and Port Chester, New York to a station at the Harlem River adjacent to the IRT Third Avenue Line. Soon a transfer station opened at East 180th Street, with transfers to the IRT White Plains Road Line and various surface lines. Express trains stopped within the Bronx only at Pelham Parkway and East 180th Street.

The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) built its East 180th Street station under the Dual Contracts. It opened on March 3, 1917, as part of an extension of the IRT White Plains Road Line from East 177th Street–East Tremont Avenue to East 219th Street–White Plains Road, providing the Bronx communities of Williamsbridge and Wakefield with access to rapid transit service. Service on the new portion of the line was operated as a four-car shuttle from 177th Street due to the power conditions at the time. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

=== Abandonment of NYW&amp;B platform ===
The NYW&amp;B was abandoned on December 31, 1937 due to bankruptcy. Two years later, city officials proposed to integrate the former NYW&amp;B south of Dyre Avenue into the IRT system branching off the IRT Pelham Line. It was later decided to only utilize the line north of the East 180th Street station, even though the line continued to the Harlem River Terminal paralleling the New Haven Railroad (NHRR) right-of-way. The New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) bought the NYW&amp;B within the Bronx north of East 180th Street in April 1940 for $1,800,000 and rehabilitated the line. The first train, an official train consisting of four cars with the Mayor and City officials, departed from East 180th Street on May 15, 1941. Trains on the line were shuttles, with a paper transfer to the IRT White Plains Road Line at East 180th Street.

The Dyre Avenue Line was connected directly to the White Plains Road Line north of East 180th Street for $3 million. The project was started in 1949 but was delayed because the necessary subway cars for the service were not available. The connection was originally supposed to open in 1950. Through service began on May 6, 1957, enabling through service by White Plains Road Line trains from Manhattan to Dyre Avenue. Trains from the Dyre Avenue Line ceased to use the former NYW&amp;B platforms, instead using the IRT platforms. The NYW&amp;B platforms had a track connection to the NHRR, which had been built in 1955 for equipment and material transfer and interchanges, including new car deliveries. The physical connection was severed by 1979. The NYW&amp;B viaduct south of East 180th Street remained standing until 2003–2004, when the structure was demolished south of Lebanon Street.

=== Station house renovation ===
From March 2010 to 2013, the station underwent a rehabilitation designed by Lee Harris Pomeroy Architects in association with Weidlinger Associates, and completed by Citnalta Construction Corporation. Luisa Caldwell was commissioned to provide new artwork. Improvements included fixing up the entrance and forecourt; replacing parts of the canopy roof, track beds, platforms and platform edges; adding new elevator access to improve circulation; and repairing electrical, mechanical, plumbing, lighting and communication equipment. As part of the project, a &quot;dank passageway between the administration building and the passenger platforms&quot; was converted &quot;into an inviting, light-filled corridor.&quot; Community groups hoped to see the return of businesses inside the station such as a barber shop, shoe repair, and dry cleaners which existed in the early 20th century.

The New York City Transit Authority paid $66.6 million for the station&#x27;s renovation. The renovation also restored a clock beneath the figure of Mercury on the building&#x27;s facade. The clock was not in the renovation budget, but the president of Citnalta did not like the facade&#x27;s appearance without a clock. Citnalta located a 45-inch diameter clock with Roman numerals and covered its $8,000 price and labor to install it as an extra contribution to the renovation. The East 180th Street station rehabilitation was completed and closed out in May 2013 at a $49.5 million cost, with another $10.4 million included for ADA access. It had been delayed six months to resolve and complete punch work.

===Later changes===
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced in 2024 that it would replace the station&#x27;s existing waist-high turnstiles with taller, wide-aisle turnstiles.

==Station layout==
=== New York City Subway platforms ===
The New York City Subway station has two island platforms and three tracks. All 2 trains, and 5 trains at all times except rush hours and late nights, stop at the outer tracks. The center track is used by 5 service during rush hours in the peak direction (when it runs express to or from Third Avenue–149th Street) and late nights (when shuttle trains from Eastchester–Dyre Avenue terminate here). The express run to Third Avenue–149th Street is long and bypasses seven stations, making it the second-longest express run in the system, after the express run between 125th Street and 59th Street–Columbus Circle on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, which also bypasses seven stations.

The south end of the platforms has a staff-only bridge allowing access from the platforms to the East 180th Street Yard directly to the west.

Heading north, after West Farms Square–East Tremont Avenue, trains turn east and enter the S-curve to East 180th Street. To the northeast are the Unionport Yard and a signal tower; just to the northwest is the flyover that carries the southbound track of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line. The 2 train continues on the IRT White Plains Road Line to Wakefield–241st Street, while the 5 train diverges to the Dyre Avenue Line northeast to Eastchester–Dyre Avenue. Some 5 trains continue on the White Plains Road Line during rush hours and run local to Nereid Avenue.

=== New York, Westchester and Boston Railway platforms ===

Directly to the east of the platforms are the platforms of the old New York, Westchester and Boston Railway&#x27;s 180th Street station. After the demise of NYW&amp;B in 1937, a portion of the main line was bought by the city of New York, which converted it into the subway and renamed it the IRT Dyre Avenue Line. The line north of Dyre Avenue and south of East 180th Street was abandoned and demolished, leaving the Dyre Avenue Line with no rail connections, so subway service debuted in 1940 as a full-time shuttle.

In 1957, a flyover connection between the IRT White Plains Road and Dyre Avenue Lines opened, allowing trains from the latter to travel to Manhattan and Brooklyn. All services that formerly used the NYW&amp;B tracks and platforms moved to the White Plains Road Line platforms and tracks.

== Exits ==
The fare control is in the old New York, Westchester and Boston Railway station house. A secondary exit leads to 180th Street. Until the 1980s, the station had escalators to the street level via a mezzanine, the remains of which are visible beneath the tracks.

=== Original station house ===
The original NYW&amp;B station house on Morris Park Avenue is still in use as the main entrance. The station was designed by Fellheimer &amp; Long with Allen H. Stem Associated Architects. The building is made of concrete and has a three-story central section flanked by four-story projecting end pavilions; in addition, it has a street level loggia.

It contains office space and a small convenience store, and previously housed New York City Transit Police&#x27;s Transit District #12, now located across the street at 460 Morris Park Avenue. The offices on the building&#x27;s upper floors house employees in the New York Transit Authority&#x27;s rapid transit operations, signals and structures divisions. Restoration of the station house was completed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 2013. It was designated a New York City Landmark in 1976 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is the only free-standing National Register building that serves as the entrance to a subway station.

<text>The Pelham Parkway station is a local station on the IRT White Plains Road Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Pelham Parkway and White Plains Road in the Pelham Parkway neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the 2 train at all times and by the 5 train during rush hours in the peak direction.

==History==
This station was built under the Dual Contracts. It opened on March 3, 1917, as part of an extension of the IRT White Plains Road Line from East 177th Street–East Tremont Avenue to East 219th Street–White Plains Road, providing the Bronx communities of Williamsbridge and Wakefield with access to rapid transit service. Service on the new portion of the line was operated as a four-car shuttle from 177th Street due to the power conditions at the time. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

This station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 30, 2005. It was renovated in 2007 at a cost of $18.85 million (). At the same time, another project was undertaken to install elevators at the station, making it ADA-accessible for $2.43 million ().

==Station layout==

This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms with the center express track only used for select AM rush hour 5 trains terminating at Gun Hill Road.

Due to the width of Pelham Parkway and its service roads, the entire station, including the platform windscreens, canopies, and outer street support columns, is enclosed in concrete over the steel structure. A green trim line runs on top of the windscreens and no columns support the canopies.

===Exits===

This station has two mezzanines, both of which are beneath the tracks and platforms. The full-time one is at the south end and has a staircase and elevator from each platform going down to a waiting area/crossunder, where a turnstile bank provides access to and from the station. The Manhattan-bound platform also has a short, up-only escalator from the station house. Outside fare control, there is a token booth, one staircase and elevator going down to the southwest corner of Pelham Parkway&#x27;s south service road and White Plains Road, and one up-escalator from the southeast corner of the same intersection. The three elevators make this station fully ADA-accessible.

The north station house, which was renovated in the late 1990s, is unstaffed, containing two staircases from each platform, two more from either northern corners of Pelham Parkway&#x27;s north service road and White Plains Road, and full height turnstiles.

== Artwork ==
In 1976, with funding from the Exxon Corporation, this station, as well as three others citywide, received new &quot;artfully humorous graffiti&quot; murals and artwork. Local designer Peter Bradford Associates received $5,000 to repaint the station and put &quot;16 bright posters of animals and parts of animals&quot; on each platform wall, in the theme of the nearby Bronx Zoo.

The current artwork at this station, installed during a 2004-2007 renovation, is called &quot;Back to the Garden&quot; by Tomie Arai. It consists of stained glass windows on the platform windscreens depicting images of trees and plants, inspired by the nearby zoo and botanical garden.

<text>The Gun Hill Road station is an express station on the IRT White Plains Road Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Gun Hill and White Plains Roads in the Williamsbridge neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the 2 train at all times and by the 5 train during rush hours in the peak direction; limited a.m. rush hour 5 trains from Manhattan also terminate at this station in the northbound direction only.

== History ==
This station was built under the Dual Contracts. It opened on March 3, 1917, as part of an extension of the IRT White Plains Road Line from East 177th Street–East Tremont Avenue to East 219th Street–White Plains Road, providing the Bronx communities of Williamsbridge and Wakefield with access to rapid transit service. Service on the new portion of the line was operated as a four-car shuttle from 177th Street due to the power conditions at the time.

The lower level was used by the IRT Third Avenue Line from October 4, 1920, until the line&#x27;s abandonment on April 29, 1973.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The station was renovated in 2007 at a cost of $31.68 million.

==Station layout==

The station was designed as a bi-level station. The upper level has three tracks and two island platforms, while the lower level had two tracks and one wide island platform. North of the station, the lower level tracks rose and joined, making a five track line for a short distance. From west to east, they were as follows: White Plains Road Line southbound local, Third Avenue Line southbound, White Plains Road Line center express, Third Avenue Line northbound, White Plains Road Line northbound local.

===Exit===
The station&#x27;s only exit is at a street-level station house at the north side of Gun Hill Road in the median of White Plains Road. The mid-2000s refurbishment removed the Third Avenue el level and upgraded the station with the new station house at street level. The original station house was one short block north at East 211th Street. New escalators and elevators now make this station ADA-accessible.

<doc id="729801" wikidata="Q452977" url="?curid=729801" title="Lolo Pass (Idaho–Montana)">
<text>Lolo Pass, elevation , is a mountain pass in the western United States, in the Bitterroot Range of the northern Rocky Mountains. It is on the border between the states of Montana and Idaho, approximately west-southwest of Missoula, Montana.

The pass is the highest point of the historic Lolo Trail, between the Bitterroot Valley in Montana and the Weippe Prairie in Idaho. The trail, known as naptnišaqs, or &quot;Nez Perce Trail&quot; in Salish, was used by Nez Perce in the 18th century, and by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, guided by Old Toby of the Shoshone, on their westward snowbound journey in September 1805. After a winter at Fort Clatsop in present-day northwestern Oregon, the Corps of Discovery returned the following June. The Lolo Trail is a National Historic Landmark, designated for its importance to the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and its role in the 1877 Nez Perce War.

The name of the pass is sometimes said to have been Salish version of the French name &quot;Laurence&quot; or &quot;Laurent&quot;, but was probably a regular French nickname. The name Lolo was not used by Lewis and Clark. Its first known mention is in the 1810 journal of David Thompson, who described three fur trappers, probably of French descent, named Michael, Lolo, and Gregoire.

The pass was also used in 1877 during the Nez Perce War as some of the Nez Perce under Chief Joseph tried to escape the U.S. Army. Shortly after crossing the pass, the two sides clashed at the Battle of the Big Hole in Montana.

U.S. Highway 12, belatedly completed in 1962, crosses the pass. At the August dedication ceremony at Lolo Pass attended by thousands, the states&#x27; governors, Bob Smylie of Idaho and Tim Babcock of Montana, cut through a ceremonial cedar log with a two-man crosscut saw.

Lolo Hot Springs is east of the pass in Montana. The first limited services in Idaho are in Powell, to the west of the pass, then another to Lowell, at the confluence of the Lochsa and Selway Rivers to form the Middle Fork of the Clearwater. The primary city in Idaho served by U.S. 12 is Lewiston, west of the pass at the border with Washington, where the Clearwater meets the Snake.

On March 1, 2014, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game announced that 23 wolves had been killed in the Lolo Pass area, in order to boost elk populations.

<text>The Government Inspector, also known as The Inspector General (, literally: &quot;Inspector&quot;), is a satirical play by Russian dramatist and novelist Nikolai Gogol. Originally published in 1836, the play was revised for an 1842 edition. Based upon an anecdote allegedly recounted to Gogol by Pushkin, the play is a comedy of errors, satirizing human greed, stupidity, and the political corruption of contemporary Russia.

The dream-like scenes of the play, often mirroring each other, whirl in the endless vertigo of self-deception around the main character, Khlestakov (rendered in some English translations as Hlestakov), who personifies irresponsibility, light-mindedness, and absence of measure. &quot;He is full of meaningless movement and meaningless fermentation incarnate, on a foundation of placidly ambitious inferiority&quot; (D. S. Mirsky). The publication of the play led to a great outcry in the reactionary press. It took the personal intervention of Tsar Nicholas I to have the play staged, with Mikhail Shchepkin taking the role of the Mayor. Nicholas I was personally present at the play&#x27;s premiere on the stage of the Alexandrinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on April 19, 1836, concluding that &quot;there is nothing sinister in the comedy, as it is only a cheerful mockery of bad provincial officials.&quot;

According to D. S. Mirsky, &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; &quot;is not only supreme in character and dialogue – it is one of the few Russian plays constructed with unerring art from beginning to end. The great originality of its plan consisted in the absence of all love interest and of sympathetic characters. The latter feature was deeply resented by Gogol&#x27;s enemies, and as a satire the play gained immensely from it. There is not a wrong word or intonation from beginning to end, and the comic tension is of a quality that even Gogol did not always have at his beck and call.&quot; In 2014, the play was ranked by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as one of the 15 greatest ever written.

== Background ==
Early in his career, Gogol was best known for his short stories, which gained him the admiration of the Russian literary circle, including Alexander Pushkin. After establishing a reputation, Gogol began working on several plays. His first attempt to write a satirical play about imperial bureaucracy in 1832 was abandoned out of fear of censorship. In 1835, he sought inspiration for a new satirical play from Pushkin.

Pushkin had a storied background and was once mistaken for a government inspector in 1833. His notes alluded to an anecdote distinctly similar to what would become the basic story elements for &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
The corrupt officials of a small Russian town, headed by the Mayor, react with panic to the news that an incognito inspector will soon be arriving in their town to investigate them. The flurry of activity to cover up their considerable misdeeds is interrupted by the report that a suspicious person had arrived two weeks previously from Saint Petersburg and is staying at the inn. That person, however, is not an inspector; it is Ivan Alexandreyevich Khlestakov (Hlestakov in some translations) a foppish civil servant with a wild imagination.

They learn that Khlestakov has not been paying for the hotel, just charging to the bill. Moreover, his original travel destination was Saratov Governorate, but for some unknown reason he has been staying in this town for a long time. Therefore, the Mayor and his crooked cronies are immediately certain that this upper-class twit is the dreaded inspector. For quite some time, however, Khlestakov does not even realize that he has been mistaken for someone else. Meanwhile, he enjoys the officials&#x27; terrified deference and moves in as a guest in the Mayor&#x27;s house. He also demands and receives massive &quot;loans&quot; from the Mayor and all of his associates. He also flirts outrageously with the Mayor&#x27;s wife and daughter.

Sick and tired of the Mayor&#x27;s ludicrous demands for bribes, the town&#x27;s Jewish and Old Believer merchants arrive, begging Khlestakov to have him dismissed from his post. Stunned at the Mayor&#x27;s rapacious corruption, Khlestakov states that he deserves to be exiled in chains to Siberia. Nevertheless, he still requests more &quot;loans&quot; from the merchants, promising to comply with their request.

Terrified that he is now undone, the Mayor pleads with Khlestakov not to have him arrested, only to learn that the latter has become engaged to his daughter. Khlestakov then announces that he is returning to Saint Petersburg, having been persuaded by his valet Osip that it is too dangerous to continue the charade any longer.

After Khlestakov and Osip depart on a coach driven by the village&#x27;s fastest horses, the Mayor&#x27;s friends all arrive to congratulate him. Certain that he now has the upper hand, he summons the merchants, boasting of his daughter&#x27;s engagement and vowing to squeeze them for every kopeck they are worth. However, the Postmaster suddenly arrives carrying an intercepted letter which reveals Khlestakov&#x27;s true identity – and his mocking opinion of them all.

The Mayor, after years of bamboozling governors and shaking down criminals of every description, is enraged to have been this humiliated. He screams at his cronies, stating that they, not himself, are to blame. At this moment, the famous fourth-wall breaking phrase is uttered by the Mayor to the audience: &quot;What are you laughing about? You are laughing about yourselves!&quot;. While the cronies continue arguing, a message arrives from the real Government Inspector, who is demanding to see the Mayor immediately.

==Meyerhold&#x27;s interpretation==
In 1926, the expressionistic production of the comedy by Vsevolod Meyerhold &quot;returned to this play its true surrealistic, dreamlike essence after a century of simplistically reducing it to mere photographic realism&quot;. Erast Garin interpreted Khlestakov as &quot;an infernal, mysterious personage capable of constantly changing his appearance&quot;. Leonid Grossman recalls that Garin&#x27;s Khlestakov was &quot;a character from Hoffmann&#x27;s tale, slender, clad in black with a stiff mannered gait, strange spectacles, a sinister old-fashioned tall hat, a rug and a cane, apparently tormented by some private vision&quot;.

Meyerhold wrote about the play: &quot;What is most amazing about &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; is that although it contains all the elements of... plays written before it, although it was constructed according to various established dramatic premises, there can be no doubt – at least for me – that far from being the culmination of a tradition, it is the start of a new one. Although Gogol employs a number of familiar devices in the play, we suddenly realize that his treatment of them is new... The question arises of the nature of Gogol&#x27;s comedy, which I would venture to describe as not so much &#x27;comedy of the absurd&#x27; but rather as &#x27;comedy of the absurd situation.&#x27;&quot;

In the finale of Meyerhold&#x27;s production, the actors were replaced with dolls, a device that Andrei Bely compared to the stroke &quot;of the double Cretan axe that chops off heads,&quot; but a stroke entirely justified in this case since &quot;the archaic, coarse grotesque is more subtle than subtle.&quot;

==Other adaptations==

* &quot;Antek policmajster&quot; (1935), a Polish film directed by Michał Waszyński, starring Adolf Dymsza
* &quot;The Inspector General&quot; (1949), a Hollywood musical comedy starring Danny Kaye. The film bears only passing resemblance to the original play. Kaye&#x27;s version sets the story in Napoleon&#x27;s empire, instead of Russia, and the main character presented to be the ersatz inspector general is not a haughty young government bureaucrat, but a down-and-out illiterate, run out of a gypsy&#x27;s travelling medicine show for not being greedy and deceptive enough.
* &quot;Afsar&quot; (1950), a Bollywood musical comedy directed by Chetan Anand
* &quot;Revizor&quot; (1952), USSR, directed by Vladimir Petrov.

* &quot;Tamu Agung&quot; (&quot;The Exalted Guest&quot;) (1955), an Indonesian film directed by Usmar Ismail, is a loose adaptation of Gogol&#x27;s play. The story is set in a small village in the island of Java, shortly after the nation&#x27;s independence. While not strictly a musical like its Hollywood counterpart, there are several musical numbers in the film.
* &quot;Anni ruggenti&quot; (&quot;Roaring Years&quot;) (1962), an Italian film directed by Luigi Zampa, starring Nino Manfredi. In the film, the story is transposed to a small town in South Italy, during the years of Fascism.
* &quot;Calzonzin Inspector&quot; (1974), a Mexican film directed and co-written by Alfonso Arau, using the political cartoonist/writer Rius&#x27;s characters.
* &quot;Reviisori&quot; (1975), a Finnish straight adaptation.
* &quot;Tosun Paşa&quot; (1976), a Turkish film directed by Kartal Tibet starring Kemal Sunal. In the film, the story is transposed to Ottoman Empire.

* &quot;De Boezemvriend&quot; (&quot;The Bosom Friend&quot;) (1982), a Dutch film starring André van Duin. A musical comedy which is not so much an adaptation of Gogol&#x27;s work, but a remake of &quot;The Inspector General.&quot; An itinerant dentist in the French-occupied Netherlands is taken for a French tax inspector.
* &quot;Revizor&quot; (1996), a Russian version directed by Sergey Gazarov, with Nikita Mikhalkov playing the Mayor.

===Television===
In 1958 the British comedian Tony Hancock appeared as Khlestakov in a live BBC Television version (which survives).

The PBS series &quot;Wishbone&quot; adapted the story for an episode.

In 2002 the Iranian playwright and director Mohammad Rahmanian adapted a version for national TV called Bazres-e-kol.

===Theatre===
Fyodor Dostoyevsky played the postmaster Shpekin in a charity performance with proceeds going to the &quot;Society for Aid to Needy Writers and Scholars&quot; in April 1860.

&quot;Inspecting Carol&quot; (1991) by American playwright Daniel J. Sullivan is a loose adaptation in which a man auditioning for a role in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; at a small theatre is mistaken for an informer for the National Endowment for the Arts.

In 2005, the Chichester Festival Theatre produced a new version of the play translated by Alistair Beaton.

&quot;The UN Inspector&quot; (2005) by David Farr is a &quot;freely adapted&quot; version written for London&#x27;s National Theatre, which transposed the action to a modern-day ex-Soviet republic. Farr&#x27;s adaptation has been translated into French by Nathalie Rivere de Carles and was performed in France in 2008.

In 2006, Greene Shoots Theatre performed an ensemble-style adaptation at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Directed by Steph Gunary (née Kirton), the acting used physical theatre, mime, and chorus work that underpinned the physical comedy. The application of Commedia dell&#x27;arte-style characterisation both heightened the grotesque and sharpened the satire.

In 2008, Jeffrey Hatcher adapted the play for a summer run at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. A slightly revised version of that adaptation played at Milwaukee Repertory Theater in September 2009.

In 2011, London&#x27;s Young Vic Theatre presented a new version adapted by David Harrower, directed by Richard Jones, starring Julian Barratt, Doon Mackichan and Kyle Soller.

Also in 2012 the Residenz Theatre in Munich performed an adaptation by Herbert Fritsch with Sebastian Blomberg as Khlestakov.

In 2016 at the Yermolovoi Theater in Moscow there was a production by Sergei Zimliansky without words. The show was advertised as a comedy, in which music, costumes, dance, and movement by the actors tells the story in the absence of words.

The play was also revived by the Birmingham Repertory Theatre for a UK Tour in 2016 directed by Roxana Silbert. It toured New Wolsey Theatre, West Yorkshire Playhouse, Theatre Royal Stratford East, Nottingham Playhouse, Liverpool Everyman and Sheffield Crucible. This production was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award in Outstanding Achievement in Affiliate Theatre in the 2017 ceremony.

The Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah, and Prince Richard, the Duke and his Duchess of Gloucester, attended as the official party, along with the head of the unified Armed Forces, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, and Defence Minister Kevan Jones.

<text>Amaurosis fugax (, meaning &#x27;darkening&#x27;, &#x27;dark&#x27;, or &#x27;obscure&#x27;, meaning &#x27;fleeting&#x27;) is a painless temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes.

==Signs and symptoms==
The experience of amaurosis fugax is classically described as a temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes that appears as a &quot;black curtain coming down vertically into the field of vision in one eye;&quot; however, this altitudinal visual loss is not the most common form. In one study, only 23.8 percent of patients with transient monocular vision loss experienced the classic &quot;curtain&quot; or &quot;shade&quot; descending over their vision. Other descriptions of this experience include a monocular blindness, dimming, fogging, or blurring. Total or sectorial vision loss typically lasts only a few seconds, but may last minutes or even hours. Duration depends on the cause of the vision loss. Obscured vision due to papilledema may last only seconds, while a severely atherosclerotic carotid artery may be associated with a duration of one to ten minutes. Certainly, additional symptoms may be present with the amaurosis fugax, and those findings will depend on the cause of the transient monocular vision loss.

==Cause==
Prior to 1990, amaurosis fugax could, &quot;clinically, be divided into four identifiable symptom complexes, each with its underlying pathoetiology: embolic, hypoperfusion, angiospasm, and unknown&quot;. In 1990, the causes of amaurosis fugax were better refined by the Amaurosis Fugax Study Group, which has defined five distinct classes of transient monocular blindness based on their supposed cause: embolic, hemodynamic, ocular, neurologic, and idiopathic (or &quot;no cause identified&quot;). Concerning the pathology underlying these causes (except idiopathic), &quot;some of the more frequent causes include atheromatous disease of the internal carotid or ophthalmic artery, vasospasm, optic neuropathies, giant cell arteritis, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intracranial pressure, orbital compressive disease, a steal phenomenon, and blood hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability.&quot;

===Embolic and hemodynamic origin===
With respect to embolic and hemodynamic causes, this transient monocular visual loss ultimately occurs due to a temporary reduction in retinal artery, ophthalmic artery, or ciliary artery blood flow, leading to a decrease in retinal circulation which, in turn, causes retinal hypoxia. While, most commonly, emboli causing amaurosis fugax are described as coming from an atherosclerotic carotid artery, any emboli arising from vasculature preceding the retinal artery, ophthalmic artery, or ciliary arteries may cause this transient monocular blindness.
* Atherosclerotic carotid artery: Amaurosis fugax may present as a type of transient ischemic attack (TIA), during which an embolus unilaterally obstructs the lumen of the retinal artery or ophthalmic artery, causing a decrease in blood flow to the ipsilateral retina. The most common source of these athero-emboli is an atherosclerotic carotid artery.&lt;br&gt; However, a severely atherosclerotic carotid artery may also cause amaurosis fugax due to its stenosis of blood flow, leading to ischemia when the retina is exposed to bright light. &quot;Unilateral visual loss in bright light may indicate ipsilateral carotid artery occlusive disease and may reflect the inability of borderline circulation to sustain the increased retinal metabolic activity associated with exposure to bright light.&quot;
* Atherosclerotic ophthalmic artery: Will present similarly to an atherosclerotic internal carotid artery.
* Cardiac emboli: Thrombotic emboli arising from the heart may also cause luminal obstruction of the retinal, ophthalmic, and/or ciliary arteries, causing decreased blood flow to the ipsilateral retina; examples being those arising due to (1) atrial fibrillation, (2) valvular abnormalities including post-rheumatic valvular disease, mitral valve prolapse, and a bicuspid aortic valve, and (3) atrial myxomas.
* Temporary vasospasm leading to decreased blood flow can be a cause of amaurosis fugax. Generally, these episodes are brief, lasting no longer than five minutes, and have been associated with exercise. These vasospastic episodes are not restricted to young and healthy individuals. &quot;Observations suggest that a systemic hemodynamic challenge provoke[s] the release of vasospastic substance in the retinal vasculature of one eye.&quot;
* Giant cell arteritis: Giant cell arteritis can result in granulomatous inflammation within the central retinal artery and posterior ciliary arteries of eye, resulting in partial or complete occlusion, leading to decreased blood flow manifesting as amaurosis fugax. Commonly, amaurosis fugax caused by giant cell arteritis may be associated with jaw claudication and headache. However, it is also not uncommon for these patients to have no other symptoms. One comprehensive review found a two to nineteen percent incidence of amaurosis fugax among these patients.
* Systemic lupus erythematosus
* Periarteritis nodosa
* Eosinophilic vasculitis
* Hyperviscosity syndrome
** Polycythemia
* Hypercoagulability
** Protein C deficiency
** Antiphospholipid antibodies
*** Anticardiolipin antibodies
*** Lupus anticoagulant
* Thrombocytosis
* Subclavian steal syndrome
* Malignant hypertension can cause ischemia of the optic nerve head leading to transient monocular visual loss.
* Drug abuse-related intravascular emboli
* Iatrogenic: Amaurosis fugax can present as a complication following carotid endarterectomy, carotid angiography, cardiac catheterization, and cardiac bypass.

===Ocular origin===
Ocular causes include:
* Iritis
* Keratitis
* Blepharitis
* Optic disc drusen
* Posterior vitreous detachment
* Closed-angle glaucoma
* Transient elevation of intraocular pressure
* Intraocular hemorrhage
* Coloboma
* Myopia
* Orbital hemangioma
* Orbital osteoma
* Keratoconjunctivitis sicca testing

===Neurologic origin===
Neurological causes include:
* Optic neuritis
* Compressive optic neuropathies
* Papilledema: &quot;The underlying mechanism for visual obscurations in all of these patients appear to be transient ischemia of the optic nerve head consequent to increased tissue pressure. Axonal swelling, intraneural masses, and increased influx of interstitial fluid may all contribute to increases in tissue pressure in the optic nerve head. The consequent reduction in perfusion pressure renders the small, low-pressure vessels that supply the optic nerve head vulnerable to compromise. Brief fluctuations in intracranial or systemic blood pressure may then result in transient loss of function in the eyes.&quot; Generally, this transient visual loss is also associated with a headache and optic disk swelling.
* Multiple sclerosis can cause amaurosis fugax due to a unilateral conduction block, which is a result of demyelination and inflammation of the optic nerve, and &quot;...possibly by defects in synaptic transmission and putative circulating blocking factors.&quot;
* Migraine
* Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension
* Intracranial tumor
* Psychogenic

==Diagnosis==
Despite the temporary nature of the vision loss, those experiencing amaurosis fugax are usually advised to consult a physician immediately as it is a symptom that may herald serious vascular events, including transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Restated, &quot;because of the brief interval between the transient event and a stroke or blindness from temporal arteritis, the workup for transient monocular blindness should be undertaken without delay.&quot; If the patient has no history of giant cell arteritis, the probability of vision preservation is high; however, the chance of a stroke reaches that for a hemispheric TIA. Therefore, investigation of cardiac disease is justified.

A diagnostic evaluation should begin with the patient&#x27;s history, followed by a physical exam, with particular importance being paid to the ophthalmic examination with regards to signs of ocular ischemia. When investigating amaurosis fugax, an ophthalmologic consultation is absolutely warranted if available. Several concomitant laboratory tests should also be ordered to investigate some of the more common, systemic causes listed above, including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lipid panel, and blood glucose level. If a particular cause is suspected based on the history and physical, additional relevant labs should be ordered.

If laboratory tests are abnormal, a systemic disease process is likely, and, if the ophthalmologic examination is abnormal, ocular disease is likely. However, in the event that both of these routes of investigation yield normal findings or an inadequate explanation, non-invasive duplex ultrasound studies are recommended to identify carotid artery disease. Most episodes of amaurosis fugax are the result of stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid artery. With that being the case, researchers investigated how best to evaluate these episodes of vision loss, and concluded that for patients ranging from 36 to 74 years old, &quot;...carotid artery duplex scanning should be performed...as this investigation is more likely to provide useful information than an extensive cardiac screening (ECG, Holter 24-hour monitoring, and precordial echocardiography).&quot; Additionally, concomitant head CT or MRI imaging is also recommended to investigate the presence of a &quot;clinically silent cerebral embolism.&quot;

If the results of the ultrasound and intracranial imaging are normal, &quot;renewed diagnostic efforts may be made,&quot; during which fluorescein angiography is an appropriate consideration. However, carotid angiography may not be necessary in the presence of a normal ultrasound and CT.

==Treatment==
Fleeting loss of vision does not in itself require any treatment, but it may indicate an underlying condition, sometimes serious, that must be treated. If the diagnostic workup reveals a systemic disease process, directed therapies to treat the underlying cause are required. If the amaurosis fugax is caused by an atherosclerotic lesion, use of aspirin as an anticoagulant is indicated, and a carotid endarterectomy considered based on the location and grade of the stenosis. Generally, if the carotid artery is still patent, the greater the stenosis, the greater the indication for endarterectomy. &quot;Amaurosis fugax appears to be a particularly favorable indication for carotid endarterectomy. Left untreated, this event carries a high risk of stroke; after carotid endarterectomy, which has a low operative risk, there is a very low postoperative stroke rate.&quot; However, the rate of subsequent stroke after amaurosis is significantly less than after a hemispheric TIA, therefore there remains debate as to the precise indications for which a carotid endarterectomy should be performed. If the full diagnostic workup is completely normal, patient observation is recommended.

<doc id="729816" wikidata="Q486485" url="?curid=729816" title="Anasarca">
<text>Anasarca is a severe and generalized form of edema, with subcutaneous tissue swelling throughout the body. Unlike typical edema, which almost everyone will experience at some time and can be relatively benign, anasarca is a pathological process reflecting a severe disease state and can involve the cavities of the body in addition to the tissues.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Physical appearance===
Can include:
* Periorbital edema &quot;eye puffiness&quot;
* Perioral edema
* Upper extremity edema
* Ascites
* Lower extremity edema
* Pre-tibial edema
* Pedal edema

===Physical manifestations===
Can include:
* Impaired vision, difficulty opening eyes
* Shortness of breath (SOB), dyspnea on exertion (DOE), orthopnea
* Chest pain
* Extreme discomfort
* Debilitation

==Cause==
Anasarca is often caused by a decreased oncotic pressure.

=== Organ failure ===
* Liver failure
* Kidney failure
* Right-sided heart failure

=== Malignancy ===
=== Diet ===
* Severe protein deficiency

=== Systemic manifestations of ===
* Nephrotic syndrome
* Protein-losing enteropathies
* Capillary leak syndrome

=== In utero ===
In Hb Barts, the high oxygen affinity results in poor oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues, resulting in anasarca.

=== Iatrogenic ===
It can also be caused by the administration of exogenous intravenous fluid.

==Diagnosis==
Anasarca is a diagnosis made clinically and differentiated from edema by extent of body involvement and severity. Whereas edema is usually graded on a mild/moderate/severe scale and usually affects one or two regions of the body, anasarca affects the entire body and is the most severe form of edema, with subcutaneous tissue swelling from head to feet.

===Testing===
Although there is no definitive test to prove anasarca, many tests can be useful to aid in the diagnosis. Anasarca is most often seen in conjunction with a low level of albumin

A research paper published in 2001 demonstrated a linkage between low-voltage electrocardiogram (ECG) (LVE) (QRS complexes of &lt;5 mm in the limb and &lt;10 mm in the precordial leads) and Anasarca.

==Treatment==
Anasarca is a severe symptom, not a pathological process in and of itself; as such, the best treatment is to treat the underlying cause. However, there are a number of things that can be done to help get the fluid off as well as prevent further accumulation of fluid.

===Diuretics===
One of the mainstays of any edema treatment, diuretics are a category of medications that help the body excrete fluid by altering the way in which the kidney processes urine.
* Loop diuretics
* Thiazide diuretics
* Thiazide-like diuretics
* Potassium-sparing diuretics

===Diet===
The body more efficiently absorbs fluid from the gut and retains that fluid with the help of sodium and sugar. As such, decreasing salt and simple sugar intake will help prevent accumulation of fluid and potentiate the effect of any diuretics.
Following a high protein diet will help provide one&#x27;s body with the substrates necessary to produce albumin, the major protein in human plasma and the single most important molecule in maintaining the serum oncotic pressure.

====Fiber====
Bulking fiber, both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber, absorb water throughout the GI tract.Viscous fiber can thicken the contents of the GI track and slow the absorption of other compounds (like simple sugars).

<text>The Bulssi Japbyeon, also known in English as An Array of Critiques of Buddhism, is a 1398 Korean Neo-Confucian polemical critique of Buddhism by Chŏng To-jŏn. In this work he carried out his most comprehensive refutation of Buddhism, singling out Buddhist doctrines and practices for detailed criticism.

Chŏng stated that this book was written with the objective of refuting Buddhism once and for all &quot;lest it destroy morality and eventually humanity itself.&quot; The charges leveled against Buddhism in the &quot;Bulssi japbyeon&quot; constitute a full inventory of the various arguments made by Confucians and Neo-Confucians from the time of the introduction of Buddhism into East Asia during the 2nd century CE. These arguments are arranged in eighteen sections, each of which criticises a particular aspect of Buddhist doctrine or practice.

<doc id="729824" wikidata="Q1650775" url="?curid=729824" title="Edward Davy">
<text>Edward Davy (16 June 1806 – 26 January 1885) was an English physician, scientist, and inventor who played a prominent role in the development of telegraphy, and invented an electric relay.

Davy was born in Ottery St Mary, Devonshire, England, son of Thomas Davy (medical practitioner and house surgeon at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London). Edward Davy was educated at a school run by his maternal uncle in Tower Street, London. He was then apprenticed to Dr C. Wheeler, house surgeon at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital. Davy won the prize for botany in 1825, was licensed by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries in 1828 and the Royal College of Surgeons in 1829. Soon after graduating, Davy began trading as an operative chemist under the name of Davy &amp; Co. In 1836 he published a small book &quot;Experimental Guide to Chemistry&quot;, at the end of which was a catalogue of goods supplied by his firm. Davy is distantly related to Humphry Davy.

Davy published &quot;Outline of a New Plan of Telegraphic Communication&quot; in 1836 and carried out telegraphic experiments the following year. He demonstrated the operation of the telegraph over a mile of wire in Regent&#x27;s Park. In 1837 he demonstrated a working model of the telegraph in Exeter Hall. This demonstration caused serious concern to rival telegraph developers William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone, especially as Davy had been approaching railway companies who were also the main target for Cooke and Wheatstone. Both Davy and the exhibition hall were threatened with legal action on the grounds that they were infringing the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph patent. Davy&#x27;s telegraph was not protected by a patent at this stage, but one was granted in the following year, 1838, despite the objections of Cooke and Wheatstone. Davy invented a relay which used a magnetic needle which dipped into a mercury contact when an electric current passed through the surrounding coil. In recognition of this he was elected in 1885 as an honorary member of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and was informed of this by telegraph shortly before his death.

Davy apparently had some thoughts on a wireless telegraphy system. This system was an electrical-acoustic hybrid, but Davy&#x27;s writings are far from clear exactly what was intended and nothing was put into practice. According to John Fahie, the best interpretation of Davy&#x27;s concept is a chain of sound transmitters, such as a bell, and focused sound reflectors tuned to the transmission note to receive the signal. At each intermediate station the sound is renewed using electrical repeaters incorporating Davy&#x27;s relay.

Davy&#x27;s marriage broke down shortly after the Regent&#x27;s Park demonstration and he found himself in litigation with his wife and her creditors. In August 1838 he fled to Australia to avoid them, giving up work on the telegraph in the process. His telegraph patents were purchased by the Electric Telegraph Company in 1847 for £600, mostly in order to obtain the rights to the electric relay invented by Davy. The rest of his telegraph system was not wanted, other than to prevent competitors from using it. He was editor of the &quot;Adelaide Examiner&quot; from June to July 1842 and was elected president of the Port Adelaide Mechanics&#x27; Institute at its inaugural meeting in 1851. Davy was a director and manager of the Adelaide Smelting Company and became chief assayer of the Government Assay Office in Adelaide in February 1852.

Davy was appointed assay master in Melbourne in July 1853 until the office was abolished in October 1854. For a short while, he took up farming near Malmsbury, Victoria then moved into Malmsbury where he practised as a physician for the rest of his life. He was three times mayor of Malmsbury.

<doc id="729827" wikidata="Q469396" url="?curid=729827" title="Chŏng Tojŏn">
<text>Chŏng Tojŏn (; October 6, 1342 – October 6, 1398), also known by his art name Sambong (), was a prominent Korean scholar-official during the late Goryeo to the early Joseon periods. Chŏng Tojŏn was an adviser to the Joseon founder Yi Sŏng-gye and also the principal architect of the Joseon dynasty&#x27;s policies, laying down the kingdom&#x27;s ideological, institutional, and legal frameworks which would govern it for five centuries. He was killed by prince Yi Pang-wŏn in 1398 over a conflict regarding the succession of Taejo.

== Biography ==
===Background and early career===
Chŏng Tojŏn was born from a noble family, the Bonghwa Chŏng clan (), in Yeongju, Goryeo. His maternal grandmother was a slave according to the Veritable Records, though the credibility of this account is called into question. His family had emerged from commoner status some four generations before, and slowly climbed up the ladder of government service. His father was the first in the family to obtain a high post. Despite all his difficulties, he became a student of Yi Che-hyŏn and along with other leading thinkers of the time, such as Chŏng Mong-ju, his penetrating intelligence started to affect the Korean politics.

===Relationship with Yi Sŏng-gye===
Chŏng Tojŏn&#x27;s ties with Yi Sŏng-gye and the foundation of Joseon were extremely close. He is said to have compared his relationship to Yi Sŏng-gye, to that between Zhang Liang and Emperor Gaozu of Han. Chŏng Tojŏn&#x27;s political ideas had a lasting impact on Joseon Dynasty politics and laws.
The two first became acquainted in 1383, when Chŏng Tojŏn visited Yi Sŏng-gye at his quarters in Hamgyong province. After Yi Sŏng-gye (Taejo of Joseon) founded Joseon in July 1392, he appointed Chŏng Tojŏn to the highest civilian and military office simultaneously, entrusting him with all necessary power to establish the new dynasty. Deciding all policies from military affairs, diplomacy, and down to education, he laid down Joseon&#x27;s political system and tax laws, replaced Buddhism with Confucianism as national religion, moved the capital from Kaesong to Hanyang (present-day Seoul), changed the kingdom&#x27;s political system from feudalism to highly centralized bureaucracy, and wrote a code of laws that eventually became Joseon&#x27;s constitution. He even decided the names of each palace, eight provinces, and districts in the capital. He also worked to free many slaves and reformed land policy.

===Conflict with Yi Pang-wŏn===
After Joseon was established in July 1392, Chŏng Tojŏn soon collided with Yi Pang-wŏn over the question of choosing the crown prince, the future successor to Yi Sŏng-gye (Taejo of Joseon). Of all princes, Yi Pang-wŏn contributed most to his father&#x27;s rise to power and expected to be appointed as the crown prince even though he was Taejo&#x27;s fifth son. However, Chŏng Tojŏn persuaded Taejo to appoint his young eighth son Yi Bang-seok (Yi Pang-wŏn&#x27;s half-brother) as the crown prince. Their conflict arose because Chŏng Tojŏn saw Joseon as a kingdom led by ministers while the king was to be largely symbolic figure, whereas Yi Pang-wŏn wanted to establish the absolute monarchy ruled directly by the king. Both sides were well aware of each other&#x27;s great animosity and were getting ready to strike first. After the sudden death of Queen Sindeok in 1398, while King Taejo was still in mourning for her (his second wife and mother of Yi Bang-sŏk), Yi Pang-wŏn struck first by raiding the palace and killed Chŏng Tojŏn and his supporters as well as Queen Sindeok&#x27;s two sons including the crown prince, in a coup that came to be known as the First Strife of the Princes. Taejo, who helplessly watched his favorite sons and ministers being killed by Yi Pang-wŏn&#x27;s forces, abdicated in disgust and remained angry with Yi Pang-wŏn well after Yi Pang-wŏn became the third king of Joseon, Taejong of Joseon.

For much of Joseon history, Chŏng Tojŏn was vilified or ignored despite his contribution to its founding. He was finally rehabilitated in 1865 in recognition of his role in designing Gyeongbokgung (main palace). Earlier Chŏngjo published a collection of Chŏng Tojŏn&#x27;s writings in 1791. Chŏng Tojŏn&#x27;s once-close friend and rival Chŏng Mong-ju, who was assassinated by Yi Pang-wŏn for remaining loyal to the Goryeo Dynasty, was honored by Yi Pang-wŏn posthumously and was remembered as symbol of loyalty throughout the Joseon Dynasty despite being its most determined foe.

Two ideas set forth by Chŏng Tojŏn strained his relationship with Yi Pang-wŏn. Chŏng believed that the new dynasty, Joseon, should be governed primarily by the neo-Confucianist officialdom and not by absolute monarchy. Such thinking of Chŏng is detailed in his book &quot;Joseon Gyeonggukjeon&quot; (), on which the official state legal code, Gyeongguk daejeon, is based. A scene in the Veritable Records describes Yi Sŏng-gye praising Chŏng for &quot;Joseon Gyeonggukjeon&quot;, but it is speculated that Yi Sŏng-gye was not fully literate and did not comprehend the extent of what Chŏng was suggesting. However, Yi Pang-wŏn, who had passed the civil service examination of Goryeo, would have understood the implications of Chŏng&#x27;s thinking.

Chŏng also pushed for the abolishment of private armies. Shortly after Joseon&#x27;s founding, Chŏng and other prominent scholar-officials set out to identify the trappings of Goryeo that precipitated its demise and put forth reform ideas. Unequal land ownership and private armies were generally agreed to have contributed to rampant corruption. Chŏng argued that land should be returned to the central government (and distributed to small farmers) and that private armies should be abolished, including those of the princes. Yi Pang-wŏn was not pleased according to the records where Chŏng demanded that all private armies be sent to the central government to be trained for the military campaign into Liaodong that Chŏng claimed was necessary. None of the princes complied.

==Death==
In 1398, Chŏng Tojŏn was slain by Yi Pang-wŏn in the First Strife of the Princes. It is unclear exactly how he died, and the accounts in the Veritable Records and Sambongjip do not agree on the precise way in which he died. The Veritable Records depict that Chŏng Tojŏn begged Yi Pang-wŏn for his life, whereas Sambongjip portrays a more dignified last moment in which Chŏng left a death poem lamenting his poor judgment and gracefully accepted his death. The credibility of either account is questioned. The story conveyed in the Veritable Records could be a result of the vilification of Chŏng throughout Joseon history. It is also argued that Yi Pang-wŏn could not have afforded to allow Chŏng the time to compose a poem in the midst of a full-blown coup.

==Intellectual activity==
Chŏng Tojŏn was a major opponent of Buddhism at the end of the Goryeo period. He was a student of Zhu Xi&#x27;s thought. Using Cheng-Zhu school&#x27;s Neo-Confucian philosophy as the basis of his anti-Buddhist polemic, he criticized Buddhism in a number of treatises as being corrupt in its practices, and nihilistic and antinomian in its doctrines. One of the more famous of these treatises was the &quot;Bulssi Japbyeon&quot; (&quot;Array of Critiques Against Buddhism&quot;). He was a founding member of the Sungkyunkwan, the royal Confucian academy, and one of its early faculty members.

Chŏng Tojŏn was among the first Korean scholars to refer to his thought as Silhak, or &quot;practical learning.&quot; However, he is not usually numbered among the members of the silhak tradition, which arose much later in the Joseon period.

==Political thought==
Chŏng Tojŏn argued that the government, including the king himself, exists for the sake of the people. Its legitimacy could only come from benevolent public service. It was largely on this basis that he legitimized the overthrow of the Goryeo dynasty, arguing that the Goryeo rulers had given up their right to rule.

Chŏng Tojŏn divided society into three classes: (a) a large lower class of agricultural laborers and craftsmen, (b) a middle class of literati, and (c) a small upper class of bureaucrats. Anyone outside this system, including Buddhist monks, shamans, and entertainers, he considered a &quot;vicious&quot; threat to the social fabric.

== Reception ==
Immediatedly following his death, he was criticized as a betrayer of the Goryeo dynasty and a greedy politician who had attempted to take power from his king. For the next 300 years, he was regarded as a treacherous villain. For example, Song Si-yŏl, the most reputable philosopher of the 15th century Joseon dynasty, always included a word &quot;insidious&quot; when he mentioned about Chŏng Tojŏn. Yi Ik, also a renowned Korean philosopher of the Middle Age of the dynasty, referred to him as &quot;a figure who deserved to be killed&quot; in his book, Seong Ho Sa Seol.

However, with the surge of revisionism in the 18th century, his work started to be assessed with a different angle. Chŏngjo, 22nd King of Joseon, republished &quot;Sambong Jip&quot;, recognizing his work building the political systems and intellectual foundations of the dynasty.

==Works==

Debuting in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #89 (October 1961) during the Silver Age of Comic Books, Fin Fang Foom appeared during Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;pre-superhero&quot; period, which would not become integrated into Marvel&#x27;s mainstream fictional continuity until the 1970s.

Writer-editor Stan Lee&#x27;s inspiration for the character&#x27;s name was the title of the 1934 film version of the long-running British stage musical &quot;Chu Chin Chow.&quot; As Lee described in 2005:
The character first appeared in the standalone story &quot;Fin Fang Foom&quot; in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #89 (October 1961) where a Nationalist Chinese scholar Chan Liuchow awakened Fin Fang Foom and tricked him into destroying a Communist Chinese invasion force of Taiwan. Fin Fang Foom reappeared in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #23-24 (April and June 1974) where he battled It! The Living Colossus. He was impersonated by the Midgard Serpent in &quot;Thor&quot; #379 (May 1987). His first story was reprinted in &quot;Fantasy Masterpieces&quot; #2 (April 1966), &quot;Where Monsters Dwell&quot; #21 (May 1973) and &quot;Marvel Monsterworks&quot; (1990). Foom, as well as his opponent, Chan Liuchow, eventually reappeared in Marvel continuity in &quot;Legion of Night&quot; #1-2 (October 1991), and then made multiple appearances in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #261-264 (October 1990 - January 1991); 267 (April 1991) and 270–275 (July-December 1992), and returned in &quot;Iron Man&quot; (vol. 3) #15-18 (April–July 1999).

An alternate version appears in &quot;Mutant X Annual&quot; 2001. Foom briefly appeared in the intercompany crossover &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; #1 (September 2003). The villain Nightmare changed a creature called a Mindless One into a copy of Foom to battle the Hulk in &quot;Hulk&quot; (vol. 3) #79 (May 2005).

The character&#x27;s origins and early days are developed in &quot;Marvel Monsters: Monsters On The Prowl&quot; #1 (December 2005) and &quot;Fin Fang Four&quot; #1 (December 2005). Foom also appeared in &quot;Nextwave&quot; #1-2 (March–April 2006), &quot;Marvel Holiday Special 2006&quot; (January 2007), in a dream in &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; (vol. 3) #1 (November 2007), in &quot;Iron Man: Las Vegas&quot; (May-June 2008); and appeared briefly in the limited series &quot;Age of the Sentry&quot; #1-6 (September 2008-May 2009); one-shot titles &quot;Monster-Size Hulk&quot; #1 (December 2008) and &quot;Dark Reign Files&quot; #1 (April 2009) and featured in another monster one-shot title, &quot;Fin Fang Four Return!&quot; (July 2009) as well as another version in &quot;Hulk: Broken Worlds&quot; #2 (July 2009).

==Fictional character biography==
It is revealed in flashback that Fin Fang Foom is an alien being from the world of Kakaranathara (also known as Maklu IV) in the Maklu star-system of the Greater Magellanic Cloud, in the Milky Way galaxy. The aliens arrive on Earth in China nearing the end of its ancient periods, intending to conquer the planet. Because of them, the Chinese dragons symbolize potent and auspicious powers in culture, allowing monarchs, especially emperors, to claim the banner &quot;Sons of Heaven&quot; since King Wen of the Zhou dynasty. In time, during the Qin dynasty, their presences signal the beginning of the country&#x27;s imperial periods. Using their shapeshifting powers to mimic human form, the aliens infiltrate human society to study it before beginning their conquest. Foom, the navigator, is the exception and, acting as a reserve, is placed in a tomb in a catatonic state.

Sometime during the early Qing dynasty, Fin Fang Foom attacked the Tianjin Prefecture for constructing the governor&#x27;s mansion on top of the land&#x27;s dragon lines, but was thwarted by Zheng Zu and the Five Weapons Society.

In the 1960s, Fin Fang Foom is awakened by a scholar Chan Liuchow, whose homeland of Taiwan is under threat from invading forces of Communist China. Liuchow goads the dragon into chasing him into the Communist invasion force which Foom destroys and then back to Fin Fang Foom&#x27;s tomb, where the creature is returned to sleep via the use of a rare herb. The mad scientist Doctor Vault locates and mentally controls the dragon for use against Vault&#x27;s foe, It, the Living Colossus. Fin Fang Foom resists the control and aids the Colossus against an alien invasion by the gargoyles of the planet Stonus V (intent on preserving Earth for the gargoyles to conquer at a later date), then briefly battles the Colossus before being freed from Vault&#x27;s control and returning to hibernation once again. Fin Fang Foom is again roused from his slumber when his body is possessed by the demon &quot;Aan Taanu&quot;. Combating a group of occult adventurers (including an older Chan Liuchow, now a professor) known as the Legion of Night in New York, Taanu is exorcised from Foom&#x27;s body, and the creature once again returns to hibernation.

The Makluan vessel is eventually found by a man who steals ten sophisticated rings from it, and becomes the supervillain the Mandarin. The Mandarin is directed to the Valley of the Sleeping Dragon by a man called Chen Hsu, who is actually the captain of Foom&#x27;s vessel. The Mandarin finds and wakes Fin Fang Foom, using the dragon to threaten the Chinese government. Fin Fang Foom helps the Mandarin take control of one-third of China, and is then revealed as an alien of Kakaranathara. With &quot;Chen Hsu&quot;, whose true form is also revealed, the pair begin to summon the rest of the crew, who had been disguised as humans for centuries. Realizing he has been tricked, the Mandarin joins forces with heroes Iron Man and War Machine to defeat the dragons, the battle ending with their apparent annihilation.

Although Fin Fang Foom&#x27;s body is destroyed, the alien&#x27;s spirit survives and bonds itself to a dragon statue, which was stolen from a curio shop by teenager Billy Yuan at Fin Fang Foom&#x27;s mental urging. Using Yuan&#x27;s body as a conduit for his power, Foom summons thousands of lizards from the sewers beneath New York, merging them with Yuan&#x27;s body to recreate his own form. Iron Man, however, defeats Foom with assistance from the last remnants of Yuan&#x27;s mind. Due to legal complications, the defeated dragon is sent to Monster Isle once again.

In the crossover series &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;, Fin Fang Foom and several other monsters battle the dimension-displaced Justice League of America.
Fin Fang Foom is captured by the Elder of the Universe known as the Collector, and imprisoned with a subterranean collection of monsters. After being captured, along with other monsters, by the recently formed Fantastic Four and deposited on &quot;Monster Isle&quot;, Fin Fang Foom returns to China and hibernation.

With the other members of the Makluan crew dead, Fin Fang Foom decides to reform and becomes a follower of Buddhism. Entering into a rehabilitation program with three other monsters - the robot Elektro; the giant ape Gorgilla, and the alien Googam - Foom is shrunk down to human size, hypnotically stripped of all his powers and allowed to enter human society. Fin Fang Foom becomes head chef in a Chinese restaurant within the Baxter Building, and teams with the other monsters to defeat the size-changing warlord Tim Boo Ba. Fin Fang Foom begrudgingly aids Wong (the servant of Doctor Strange) in defeating a force of HYDRA agents.

Fin Fang Foom is later confronted and defeated by Squirrel Girl.

Howard the Duck also has dreams of playing cards with the Thing; the Man-Thing; Bigfoot; Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster and Fin Fang Foom.

There have also been two imitations of Fin Fang Foom. The Midgard Serpent imitated Foom to attempt to trick the thunder god Thor, while the villain Nightmare changed a Mindless One into a copy of Fin Fang Foom to battle the Hulk. Thor also claims to have killed the true Fin Fang Foom in battle, and uses the dragon&#x27;s bones to build a tomb in the realm of Nidavellir.

Under orders from the Roxxon Energy Corporation, Mentallo controls the mind of Fin Fang Foom and other giant monsters in a plot to take over an island and drill for oil.

During the &quot;Monsters Unleashed&quot; storyline, Fin Fang Foom, Gorgilla, the Green Thing, and Zzutak confront Kei Kawade in the forest outside his house and warned Kei Kawade against the preceding monster summoning. He was later seen falling from the sky alongside the other monsters, because they had been summoned by Kei Kawade to help superheroes fight the Leviathons. He was told by Tim Boo Ba that he and the other monsters are not fighting of their own volition. Kei Kawade later sends Fin Fang Foom to assist the Heroes for Hire against the Leviathons in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. When the Leviathon Mother shows up and calls out to Kei Kawade, Fin Fang Foom shows up to challenge her. When Kei Kawade confronts the Leviathon Mother and gets her attention, she spits out Fin Fang Foom. Following the Leviathon Mother&#x27;s death, Fin Fang Foom and the other Goliathons confront Kei Kawade. Even though Kei Kawade thanks the Goliathons for their help in fending off the Leviathons, Fin Fang Foom warns him about summoning them again before the Goliathons are teleported away.

Fin Fang Foom later embarks on a relationship with Gwenpool&#x27;s tailor Ronnie, helping her drum up customers for her Pantsgiving Day sale.

Meeting Kei again, Foom would be called upon when an alternate verse of itself had influenced the young Nuhuman into summoning him. This doppelgänger; a venomized entity enthralled to the poisons, sought to push Kid Kaiju into bringing more of their hive into Kei&#x27;s native reality. But the prime universe Foom was able to convince Kawade that their adversary had been using its own mental abilities to undermine Kei&#x27;s strength of will, thus weakening his titanic companions. The confidence boost enabled both Kei and prime Foom to topple their assailant, forestalling the eventual incursion by the rest of its kind.

==Powers and abilities==
Fin Fang Foom possesses super-strength and endurance, the abilities to fly via his wings at supersonic speeds and spew combustible acid mist from his mouth. Foom is also extremely durable and can regenerate at a rapid rate. In the event his body were to be damaged beyond his capacity to heal, he can overshadow a waiting host &amp; reshape a new physical body for himself from them. By entering into long periods of hibernation, Foom has managed to survive for centuries. Foom possesses a gifted intellect and can communicate telepathically (which, in his true form, is his &quot;only&quot; form of communication), shapeshift into almost any animal and shrink to human size. Foom also has access to advanced alien technology from his homeworld. Foom can also drain, metabolize and redirect energy of all kinds to make himself larger and stronger. At one time, Foom underwent intense meditative training in order to excise himself of his negative traits. The end result of divesting his rage, guilt and selfishness caused him to shrink yet gave rise to his malignant aspects in physical form. Fin Fang Foom also has the unique power to cause phy/men. transmogrification through optic beam emissions, having not only changed and rewired the persona&#x27;s of the Avengers to mimic that of their animal forms. But Foom could even use these powers to bring inanimate objects to life at his discretion.

<text>Johann Adam Hiller (25 December 1728 – 16 June 1804) was a German composer, conductor and writer on music, regarded as the creator of the Singspiel, an early form of German opera. In many of these operas he collaborated with the poet Christian Felix Weiße.

Hiller was a teacher who encouraged musical education for women, his pupils including Elisabeth Mara and Corona Schröter. He was Kapellmeister of Abel Seyler&#x27;s theatrical company, and became the first Kapellmeister of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.

==Biography==
By the death of his father in 1734, Hiller was left dependent to a large extent on the charity of friends. He came from a musical family, and also learned the basics of music from a school master in his home town, Wendisch-Ossig. From 1740 to 1745, he was a student at the Gymnasium in Görlitz, where his fine soprano voice earned him free tuition. In 1746 he went to study at the famous Kreuzschule in Dresden. There he took keyboard and basso continuo lessons with Gottfried August Homilius.

In 1751, he enrolled in Leipzig University to study law, supporting himself by giving music lessons, and also by performing at concerts both on the flute and as a singer. Hiller immersed himself in the rich musical life of the town, and gradually adopted music as his sole profession. He took an active role in the &quot;Großes Concert&quot;, which was the leading concert undertaking in Leipzig. During that time he wrote several symphonies, church cantatas, and arias, as well as a fragmentary Singspiel entitled &quot;Das Orackle&quot;. Hiller also published an essay on the &quot;Mimesis of Nature in Music&quot; (&quot;Abhandlung über die Nachahmung der Natur in der Musik&quot;) in 1754. That year he got his first break when he became steward and tutor to the son of Count Brühl in Dresden. He accompanied the Count to Leipzig in 1758. He remained in that position until 1760 when health problems (depression) forced him to resign. It was during his stay there that he conceived the idea of reviving some subscription concerts, an attempt which ultimately led to the founding of the Leipzig Gewandhaus concerts of which he was the first conductor.

Back in Leipzig, Hiller became the director of the &quot;Großes Concert&quot;, a position he held until 1771. That year he founded a singing school. Four years later, Hiller founded his own concert society, the &quot;Musikübende Gesellschaft&quot;. In his Leipzig school, he trained young musicians in singing and playing instruments. Two of his most famous students were Corona Schröter and Gertrud Elisabeth Mara née Schmeling, both acclaimed singers. He also taught organist and composer Daniel Gottlob Türk. In 1778 Hiller was appointed music director at the Paulinerkirche, the church of Leipzig University. During that time he also organized Concerts spirituels for Lent.

To Hiller has been given the credit of being the originator of the Singspiel, the beginning of German comedy opera as distinct from the French and Italian developments. The most important of his operas were: &quot;Lottchen am Hofe&quot; (Lottie at court, 1760), &quot;Der Teufel ist los&quot; (The devil is loose, 1768), and &quot;Poltis, oder Das gerettete Troja&quot; (Poltis, or Troy rescued, 1782). The lyrics of all his Singspiele were of considerable musical value, and were long popular. Among his sacred compositions are: &quot;A Passion Cantata&quot;, &quot;Funeral Music in Honor of Hasse&quot;, a setting of the one hundredth Psalm; and a few symphonies.

In the 1780s he acquired new positions with increased alacrity. In 1781 he became conductor of the Gewandhaus concerts. During the same year he visited the court of the Duke of Courland in Mitau, a journey that resulted in Hiller&#x27;s appointment as Kapellmeister there four years later. In addition to his posts at the &quot;Gewandhaus&quot; and the &quot;Paulinerkirche&quot;, in 1783 he also became the music director of the &quot;Neukirche&quot; which made him a top authority on music in Leipzig. However, when taking up his new job in Mitau in 1785 he resigned all his posts in Leipzig. Due to the unstable political situation at the court of Courland he resigned from his position there after only one year. Since he no longer had any occupation in Leipzig he had to organize concerts to earn his living, but fortunately he was able to secure for himself the post of music director of the city of Breslau in 1787. He spent two years in Breslau and returned to Leipzig in 1789 to become cantor at the Thomaskirche, conducting the Thomanerchor, a position filled by Johann Sebastian Bach before. Hiller held the post until 1801 when he resigned due to his age. He died at the age of 75 in Leipzig in 1804.

In addition, Hiller carried out notable work as an editor and publisher of other composers&#x27; output, and wrote considerably concerning musical topics. Indeed, he was one of the most important German musical scholars and writers of the eighteenth century. He was the father of the composer Friedrich Adam Hiller (c. 1767–1812), but he was not related to the musician Ferdinand Hiller.

==Operas==

A theme from Hiller&#x27;s opera &quot;Der Aerndtekranz&quot; (1771) was the basis for Max Reger&#x27;s orchestral &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Hiller&quot; (1907).

==Literary production==
Hiller&#x27;s major contribution in this field include the &quot;Wöchentliche Nachrichten&quot;, a music journal in which he published reviews of performances, new music publications, and essays on various music related topics. From his articles in this journal it becomes clear that Hiller was open to new trends in music, and that he preferred Hasse over J. S. Bach and Gluck. Writings of Hiller on aesthetic issues include the &quot;Abhandlung über die Nachahmung der Natur in der Musik&quot; (1754) and &quot;Über die Musik und deren Wirkungen&quot; (1781), which is a translation from Michel Paul Guy de Chabanon’s &quot;Observations sur la musique&quot;.

As a historian, Hiller published a series of anecdotes and biographies, the &quot;Anecdoten zur Lebensgeschichte großer Regenten und berühmter Staatsmänner and Lebensbeschreibungen berühmter Musikgelehrten und Tonkünstler neuerer Zeit&quot; and the &quot;Lebensbeschreibungen berühmter Musikgelehrten und Tonkünstler neuerer Zeit&quot;.

The majority of his writings concern pedagogy. In these publications Hiller presents himself as a highly competent teacher who regarded knowledge of music an essential part of everyone&#x27;s education.

<text>National Hunt Racing, also known as Jump Racing, is a form of horse racing particular to many European countries, including, but not limited to: France, Great Britain and Ireland. Jump Racing requires horses to jump over fences and ditches. 

In the UK, National Hunt Racing is divided into two major distinct branches: Hurdling and Steeplechase, as well as flat races called “Bumpers”. Hurdling involves horses jumping over Hurdles, while Steeplechase involves the horses jumping over a variety of different obstacles that includes fences, water jump or an open ditch. Some of the biggest National Hunt events of the year in the UK are the Grand National and the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

==Overview==
The National Hunt season primarily occurs during the winter months when softer ground conditions make jumping safer for horses. The horses are significantly cheaper compared to sport horses for other equestrian sports, reason being the majority are geldings and have no breeding value. 

Jump Racing primarily takes place in France, Great Britain and Ireland, with some events also taking place in Australia, Canada and the United States. In Ireland, National Hunt racing receives much higher attendances than flat racing, while in Great Britain, it is more balanced.

National Hunt horses are often bred for jumping, while others are former flat horses but they do not have to be Thoroughbreds: many French-bred jumpers are Selle Français or AQPS. Many horses begin their racing careers in amateur point-to-pointing where they compete over steeplechase races of .

Two of the biggest events of the National Hunt calendar are the Cheltenham Festival meeting and the Grand National meeting. The Cheltenham Festival is held at Cheltenham Racecourse over four days in the second week of March. On Friday, it features eleven grade one races, culminating in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, one of the most prestigious Chase races in the world. The Grand National meeting is held at Aintree over three days every April..

Other important festivals are: the Galway Races – a mixed (NH and flat) meeting in Ireland; Punchestown Festival – the Irish equivalent of the Cheltenham Festival; The Tingle Creek at Sandown Park Racecourse; the Scottish Grand National at Ayr Racecourse; the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park Racecourse; the Welsh National at Chepstow Racecourse; and the Irish National at Fairyhouse Racecourse.

== History ==
National Hunt racing originated in Ireland, particularly in the southern counties. Early races were mainly two-horse contests known as &quot;pounding races&quot; that became popular in the early 18th century. These involved long trips across country where horses were required to jump whatever obstacles the landscape threw in their way.

The first recorded race of this nature is traditionally said to have taken place between the towns of Buttevant and Doneraile in the north of County Cork in 1752. The distance of the race was . The start and finish were marked by the church steeple in each town, hence the term &quot;steeplechase&quot;.

The first use of the term steeplechase on an official racecard was in Ireland in the early 19th century. The &#x27;official&#x27; first running of the Grand National, held annually at Aintree in England, took place in 1839 and was won by an Irish horse, Lottery. The &quot;National&quot;, as it is known, was run over , but since 2013 is run over .

Organizing steeple chasing in Britain, began with annual events being staged cross country over a number of fields, hedges and brooks, the earliest most notable of these being the St Albans Steeplechase (first run in 1830). For some years, there was no regulation of steeplechasing.

A breakthrough came in the 1860s with the formation of the National Hunt Committee, and the running of the National Hunt Steeplechase. This steeplechase would form part of an annual race-meeting staged at a different track each year. The &#x27;National Hunt Meeting&#x27; established itself in the racing calendar, in turn moving around such courses as Sandown, New market, Derby, Liverpool, Hurst Park, Lincoln, Leicester and many others.

In 1904 and 1905, Cheltenham hosted the meeting, and although Warwick was awarded it for five years after that, it then returned to Cheltenham which became the permanent home of the fixture. Further prestigious races were added to the card during the 1920s, such as the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion Hurdle.

As steeple chasing entered its modern era, the Cheltenham Festival became a major part of the season, providing a series of championship races.

With the introduction of sponsorship (starting with the Whitbread Gold Cup in 1957), a whole host of other important races have been added to the National Hunt racing season,

== National Hunt racing in the 2000&#x27;s ==
Given the sport&#x27;s origins, Irish-bred and trained horses remained a force in national hunt racing during the 2000&#x27;s. In 2005 and 2006, Irish-trained horses captured the three main prizes at Cheltenham and won the Grand National. Best Mate who captured the Cheltenham Gold Cup three successive times between 2002 and 2004, was Irish-bred, but trained and owned in England.

French-bred horses have also come to the forefront with horses such as Master Minded becoming the highest rated horse in Britain after winning the Queen Mother Champion Chase. Kauto Star who won the Gold Cup in 2007, 2009 and was second in 2008 is also French bred.

==Grades and classes==
Races are graded depending on their health and mental status. The most prestigious are Grade 1, then Grade 2, Grade 3, Listed, Handicaps, to Bumpers the least prestigious. The more highly graded races attract more prize money and better horses. 
(In flat racing the more prestigious races are Group 1, 2, and 3, then Listed).

All National Hunt races are also classified in classes 1-7 (class 1 best). Graded and listed races are class 1.

See the list of Grade 1-3 National Hunt races and the list of Group 1-3 Flat races.

== Major National Hunt festivals ==
===Cheltenham===

Cheltenham Racecourse, in the Cotswolds, hosts the Cheltenham Festival in the third week of March each year, as well as other important fixtures during the NH calendar.

The highlight of the Cheltenham Festival is the Gold Cup. All races run at Cheltenham finish with a long uphill run-in in front of the stands. The Gold Cup is a Grade 1 race, run over a distance of . All horses carry the same weight in the Gold Cup. Famous winners of the Gold Cup include Dawn Run (mare, ridden by Jonjo O&#x27;Neill), Arkle, Golden Miller, Best Mate, Desert Orchid &amp; Kauto Star.

===Grand National===
The highest profile National Hunt race is the Grand National, run at Aintree in April each year. The race is a different sort of contest from the Gold Cup: it is a Grade 3 race, it is run over a distance of more than , there are up to 40 runners, the course at Aintree is essentially flat, and the horses are handicapped (the best horses carry the most weight). Perhaps the most fundamental difference is that the Grand National fences are far bigger than the fences at Cheltenham and a number of fences incorporate significant drops. The best-known fence is Becher&#x27;s Brook which is high but has a drop on landing and is often regarded as the biggest challenge on the course.

Winners of the Grand National include Red Rum (won 3 times:1973, 1974, 1977), runner up twice (1975, 1976)); Mr Frisk (1990, the last winner to date to be ridden by an amateur jockey and still holds the record for the fastest time); Aldaniti (1981, ridden by Bob Champion shortly after he had recovered from cancer. His story was made into a film); and Foinavon (1967, won at odds of 100/1 after a mêlée at the 23rd fence resulted in the majority of the field falling or refusing. Foinavon was far enough behind at that point to avoid the confusion and ran on to win by 20 lengths. The fence where the mêlée occurred is now named &quot;Foinavon Fence&quot;).

===Other National Hunt races===

Other NH races of note include the King George VI Chase, run at Kempton Park on 26 December and the Hennessy Gold Cup run at Newbury at the end of November.

==Hunter chase racing==
Hunter chases take place at national hunt racecourses but are only open to horses that have hunter certificates. Hunter certificates are issued to horses that have hunted for at least four days in the season before racing starts in January. In addition, the jockey must be an amateur who has obtained a certificate from the hunt secretary.

Unlike point-to-points, licensed trainers as well as amateur trainers may have runners in Hunter Chases. This often causes controversy when big name trainers run former Grade 1 horses in Hunter Chases as amateur trainers feel they are unable to compete. New rules which took effect in 2009, will prevent horses which have finished in the first 3 of a Grade 1 or 2 chase in the previous season from taking part.

The two biggest Hunter Chases are the Aintree Fox Hunters&#x27; Chase and Cheltenham Foxhunter Chase. The Aintree Fox Hunters&#x27; is run as the feature race on the first day of the Grand National meeting over one circuit of the Grand National course. This gives amateur riders the chance to jump these famous fences before the professionals.

The Cheltenham Foxhunter is run after the Gold Cup over the same distance and is often referred to as the amateur Gold Cup.

==Point to point racing==

&quot;Point to Point&quot; racing is steeplechase racing for amateurs.

<doc id="729853" wikidata="Q712192" url="?curid=729853" title="Three teachings">
<text>In Chinese philosophy, the three teachings (; , Chữ Hán: 三教) are Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. The learning and the understanding of the three teachings are traditionally considered to be a harmonious aggregate within Chinese culture. Literary references to the &quot;three teachings&quot; by prominent Chinese scholars date back to the 6th century. The term may also refer to a non-religious philosophical grounds of aggregation as exemplified within traditional Chinese medicine. 

== Three teachings harmonious as one ==
The phrase also appears as the &quot;three teachings harmonious as one&quot; (). In common understanding, &quot;three teachings harmonious as one&quot; simply reflects the long history, mutual influence, and (at times) complementary teachings of the three belief systems.

It can also be used in reference to the &quot;Sanyi teaching&quot;, a syncretic sect which was founded during the Ming dynasty by Lin Zhao&#x27;en, wherein Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist beliefs are combined according to their usefulness in self-cultivation. However, the phrase is not necessarily a reference to this sect.

While Confucianism was the ideology of the law, the institutions and the ruling class, Taoism was the worldview of the radical intellectuals and it was also compatible with the spiritual beliefs of the peasants and the artisans. The two, although opposite ends of the philosophical spectrum, jointly created the Chinese &quot;image of the world&quot;.

The joint worship of the three teachings can be found in some Chinese temples, such as in Hanging Temple.

Sanjiao believers think that &quot;[t]hree teachings are...safer than one&quot; and that using elements from all three brings good fortune.

== Confucianism ==
Confucianism is a complex school of thought, sometimes also referred to as a religion, revolving around the principles of the Chinese philosopher Confucius. It was developed in the Spring and Autumn period during the Zhou dynasty. The main concepts of this philosophy include &quot;ren&quot; (humaneness), &quot;yi&quot; (righteousness), &quot;li&quot; (propriety/etiquette), &quot;zhong&quot; (loyalty), and &quot;xiao&quot; (filial piety), along with strict adherence to social roles. This is illustrated through the five main relationships Confucius interpreted to be the core of society: ruler-subject, father-son, husband-wife, elder brother-younger brother, and friend-friend. In these bonds, the latter must pay respect to and serve the former, while the former is bound to care for the latter.

The following quotation is from the &quot;Analects&quot;, a compilation of Confucius&#x27; sayings and teachings, written after his death by his disciples.

This quotation exemplifies Confucius&#x27; idea of the junzi () or gentleman. Originally this expression referred to &quot;the son of a ruler&quot;, but Confucius redefined this concept to mean behaviour (in terms of ethics and values such as loyalty and righteousness) instead of mere social status.

== Taoism ==
Daoism (or Taoism) is a philosophy centered on living in harmony with the Dao (Tao) (), which is believed to be the source, pattern and substance of all matter. Its origin can be traced back to the late 4th century BCE and the main thinkers representative of this teaching are Laozi and Zhuang Zhou. Key components of Daoism are Dao (the Way) and immortality, along with a stress on balance found throughout nature. There is less emphasis on extremes and instead focuses on the interdependence between things. For example, yin and yang () do not exemplify the opposition of good against evil, but instead represents the interpenetration of mutually-dependent opposites present in everything; &quot;within the Yang there exists the Yin and vice versa&quot;.

The basis of Daoist philosophy is the idea of &quot;wu wei&quot;, often translated as &quot;non-action&quot;. In practice, it refers to an in-between state of &quot;being, but not acting&quot;. This concept also overlaps with an idea in Confucianism as Confucius similarly believed that a perfect sage could rule without taking action. Daoism assumes any extreme action can initiate a counter-action of equal extremity, and so excessive government can become tyrannical and unjust, even when initiated with good intentions.

The following is a quote from the Daodejing, one of the main texts in Daoist teachings:
== Buddhism ==

Buddhism is a religion that is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama. The main principles of this belief system are karma, rebirth, and impermanence. Buddhists believe that life is full of suffering, but that suffering can be overcome by attaining enlightenment. Nirvana (a state of perfect happiness) can be obtained by breaking away from (material) attachments and purifying the mind. However, different doctrines vary on the practices and paths followed in order to do so.

Meditation serves as a significant part of practicing Buddhism. This calming and working of the mind helps Buddhists strive to become more peaceful and positive while developing wisdom through solving everyday problems. The negative mental states that are sought to be overcome are called &quot;delusions&quot;, while the positive mental states are called &quot;virtuous minds&quot;.

Another concept prominent in the Buddhist belief system is the Eight-Fold Path. The Noble Eightfold Path is the fourth of the Four Noble Truths, which is said to be the first of all Buddha&#x27;s teachings. It stresses areas in life that can be explored and practice, such as right speech and right intention.

== Controversy ==
Though the term &quot;three teachings&quot; is often focused on how well Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism have been able to coexist in harmony throughout Chinese history, evidence has shown that each practice has dominated, or risen to favour, during certain periods of time. Emperors would choose to follow one specific system and the others were discriminated against, or tolerated at most. An example of this would be the Song dynasty, in which both Buddhism and Taoism became less popular. Neo-Confucianism (which had re-emerged during the previous Tang dynasty) was followed as the dominant philosophy.
A minority also claims that the phrase &quot;three teachings&quot; proposes that these mutually exclusive and fundamentally incomparable teachings are equal. This is a contested point of view as others stress that it is not so. Confucianism focuses on societal rules and moral values, whereas Taoism advocates simplicity and living happily while in tune with nature. On the other hand, Buddhism reiterates the ideas of suffering, impermanence of material items, and reincarnation while stressing the idea of reaching salvation beyond.

<text>Jorma Gallen-Kallela (né Gallén) (22 November 1898 – 1 December 1939) was a Finnish artist. He followed in the footsteps of his father, the famed artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela.

==Biography==
Gallen-Kallela was born in Ruovesi. He studied arts in Buenos Aires in 1915–17, in Copenhagen in 1918–19, under Maurice Denis in Paris in 1919–21, and lastly in Vienna in 1929.

He fought in the Finnish Civil War on the side of the White Guard.

He worked with his father on the Kalevala cupola frescoes at the lobby of the National Museum of Finland in 1928. In 1931, after his father had died and a fire destroyed his father&#x27;s frescoes in the Jusélius Mausoleum, he used his father&#x27;s sketches as basis to repaint the frescoes.

His independent works were the artworks for the &quot;Kalevala&quot; and &quot;Rintamamies&quot; postage stamps.

He fought in the Winter War, having risen to the rank of lieutenant. While he was inspecting a downed plane of the Soviet Air Force with captain Adolf Ehrnrooth on either the first or the second day of the war, he and Ehrnrooth were ambushed. He saved Ehrnrooth by throwing himself over him, but he himself died from his wounds.

<text>Princess Irulan is a fictional character in the &quot;Dune&quot; universe created by Frank Herbert. She first appears in &quot;Dune&quot; (1965), and is later featured in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; (1969) and &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976). The character&#x27;s birth and early childhood are touched upon in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy (1999–2001) by Herbert&#x27;s son Brian, and Kevin J. Anderson, and she is a principal character in the Herbert/Anderson series &quot;Heroes of Dune&quot; (2008–2009).

The character of Irulan serves as a &quot;de facto&quot; narrator in &quot;Dune&quot;, with excerpts of her later writings used as epigraphs before each chapter of the novel. Within the storyline, Irulan is established as the eldest daughter of the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and Anirul, a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank, and has four younger sisters and no brothers. In &quot;Dune&quot;, the character appears in person only near the end of the novel, but continues as a regular character in the sequels &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot;. Epigraphs attributed to Irulan also appear—to a much lesser extent—in these subsequent novels, and others in the extended series.

Irulan is portrayed by Virginia Madsen in the 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, and by Julie Cox in the 2000 TV miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; and its 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. The character is played by Florence Pugh in the 2024 film &quot;&quot;.

==Description==
Within the storyline, Irulan is established as the eldest daughter of the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and Anirul, a Bene Gesserit of Hidden Rank. She has four younger sisters named Chalice, Wensicia, Josifa and Rugi, and no brothers. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Irulan is described through Paul Atreides&#x27; eyes:
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen notes that Irulan has eyes &quot;that looked past and through him&quot;. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, the Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale refers to Irulan as &quot;a tall blonde beauty ... she carried herself with an aristocrat&#x27;s hauteur, but something in the absorbed smoothness of her features betrayed the controls of her Bene Gesserit background&quot;.

Although Irulan is noted to have been &quot;trained in the deepest of the Bene Gesserit ways, destined to be a Reverend Mother&quot;, in the series she never undergoes the dangerous ritual spice agony to achieve this. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; she is noted to have been &quot;well trained for a task at which she had failed, a flawed Bene Gesserit creation&quot;. Of Irulan, Lady Jessica says in &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, &quot;Irulan had never been the most accomplished adept in the Bene Gesserit—valuable more for the fact that she was a daughter of Shaddam IV than for any other reason; often too proud to exert herself in extending her capabilities.&quot;

== Appearances ==

=== &quot;Dune&quot; ===
Each chapter of &quot;Dune&quot; begins with an epigraph attributed to the Princess Irulan. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context and other details intended to enhance understanding of Herbert&#x27;s complex fictional universe and themes. These epigraphs serve as a framing device for the novel&#x27;s narrative. Ryan Britt of &quot;Inverse&quot; writes, &quot;The Irulan framing in the book gives the future-tense aspects of Paul&#x27;s visions another layer: the story of Paul&#x27;s rise to power has already happened ... this creates an interesting layer of perception for the reader. It&#x27;s not as though the fairly omniscient narration of &quot;Dune&quot; is unreliable &quot;per se&quot;, but there is an indication that the prose might be biased, which is itself a comment on the story.&quot; Irulan herself appears in person only near the end of the novel.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Shaddam orders Duke Leto Atreides to take over the valuable spice melange operations on the desert planet Arrakis. Though seemingly a reward, it is instead a means for Shaddam to destroy Leto, whose rising power and influence in the Landsraad threatens the emperor. The Atreides are soon attacked by the forces of House Harkonnen, longtime enemies of the Atreides, secretly supplemented by Shaddam&#x27;s seemingly unstoppable Imperial Sardaukar troops. Leto is killed, and Paul and his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica flee into the desert and are presumed dead. A crisis on Arrakis begins when the mysterious Muad&#x27;Dib, in actuality Paul Atreides, emerges as a leader of the native Fremen tribes rebelling against the rule of the Harkonnens. With the production of the all-important spice disrupted, Shaddam is forced to personally intervene. Irulan accompanies her father and his army to Arrakis to impose order, but Shaddam&#x27;s Sardaukar are disastrously defeated by the Fremen. Paul sets his terms: the Imperial armada will leave Arrakis, Shaddam will step down and Paul will marry Irulan—or he will destroy all spice production. Shaddam is furious, but Irulan says: &quot;Here&#x27;s a man fit to be your son.&quot; Once Paul defeats the Baron Harkonnen&#x27;s treacherous heir Feyd-Rautha in single combat, and Count Fenring refuses the Emperor&#x27;s order to kill Paul, Shaddam capitulates. Paul intends to accede to the throne in Shaddam&#x27;s place, assuming power of the Empire in Irulan&#x27;s name. He assures his concubine, Chani, that he will not give Irulan any affection, or children. Jessica, formerly the concubine to Paul&#x27;s late father, reassures Chani that though Irulan will have the Atreides name, &quot;history will call us wives.&quot;

Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; noted that while Shaddam realizes &quot;by bits and pieces&quot; that Paul has defeated him, Irulan &quot;recognizes it from the beginning&quot;. Asher-Perrin explained &quot;how nonplussed she is by the entire event. She&#x27;s like &#x27;sure, I&#x27;ll marry that guy, he seems cool&#x27; and keeps trying to get her dad to chill out.&quot; He adds, &quot;You have to wish that the book had delved into [Irulan&#x27;s] arc more, rather than presenting her as a scholar only. We could use a bit more of her personality, a bit more insight into her mind.&quot;

=== &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; ===
Twelve years later in &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, Irulan is Imperial Consort, but is Paul&#x27;s wife in name only, as he intends his beloved concubine Chani to bear his children and heirs apparent. Any hope Irulan has of bearing a new Atreides-Corrino royal bloodline with Paul—and retaining the Imperial House Corrino&#x27;s influence in some form—has been lost. She is also under pressure from the Bene Gesserit, who seek to preserve the Atreides bloodline, if not subvert Paul&#x27;s rule entirely. This resentment, coupled with Bene Gesserit orders that Paul not be allowed to father an heir with Chani, has driven Irulan to secretly drug the Fremen woman with dangerous contraceptives for years. As a result, the new Emperor and his concubine are without children. When Chani begins a special Fremen fertility diet high in melange, Irulan loses her ability to administer the contraceptives; though urged by the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam to chemically abort any potential fetus, Irulan protests. Irulan does, however, become part of a conspiracy against the Emperor involving the Bene Gesserit, Tleilaxu, and Spacing Guild. Paul says of her at this time:

Despite her ties to both the Bene Gesserit and her deposed father, Paul values Irulan as an advisor and has made her a member of his high council. Chani ultimately discovers not only Irulan&#x27;s role in her infertility but the fact that the contraceptives have caused permanent damage and will jeopardize her current pregnancy. Chani seeks to kill Irulan, but Paul forbids it. He is secretly somewhat grateful to Irulan, as he has seen through his prescience that childbirth will bring Chani&#x27;s death, and so Irulan has unwittingly extended Chani&#x27;s life. Chani dies after giving birth to Paul&#x27;s twin children, Leto II and Ghanima, and a newly blinded Paul soon thereafter wanders alone into the desert to die, as is Fremen custom for the blind. Subsequently Paul&#x27;s sister Alia notes, &quot;Do you know what I must do for [Paul]? I must save the life of the Princess Irulan. That one! You should hear her grief. Wailing, giving moisture to the dead; she swears she loved him and knew it not. She reviles her Sisterhood, says she&#x27;ll spend her life teaching Paul&#x27;s children ... She reeks of trustworthiness!&quot; The ghola Duncan Idaho realizes that the defection of Irulan leaves the Bene Gesserit with &quot;no remaining lever against the Atreides heirs.&quot;

=== &quot;Children of Dune&quot; ===
Deserting the Bene Gesserit, Irulan subsequently devotes herself to House Atreides and helping to raise Paul and Chani&#x27;s orphaned twins. Meanwhile, Irulan&#x27;s sister Wensicia plots to assassinate Leto and Ghanima to reclaim power for the Corrinos. Irulan also serves as chief advisor to Alia, who reigns as Holy Regent for young Leto and Ghanima. During the events of &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Irulan attempts to serve as a guide and confidante to Ghanima, but is often flustered by the adult consciousness the twins possess as a result of being pre-born and having access to Other Memory. Ghanima cares for Irulan, but Alia never trusts the Princess, due to Irulan&#x27;s Corrino heritage and Alia&#x27;s own increasing paranoia. This personal distrust proves to be well-placed, as Irulan follows Ghanima and Stilgar into the desert during the Fremen rebellion against Alia&#x27;s tyranny. Though the other rebels are massacred, Irulan and Stilgar are imprisoned upon their capture, and presumably freed when Leto deposes Alia.

===Other novels===
Irulan appears briefly as a child in &quot;&quot; (2001), the third novel in the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, set prior to &quot;Dune&quot;.

Irulan is a principal character in the &quot;Heroes of Dune&quot; series of novels by Brian Herbert and Anderson. Half of the story of &quot;Paul of Dune&quot; (2008) takes place between Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;8/5/06 blog&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Irulan decides to become Paul&#x27;s official biographer, shaping his legend. In the story, as Paul&#x27;s Jihad rages, Shaddam seeks to regain his throne, and Irulan accepts the &quot;task of building the legend of Muad&#x27;Dib&quot;. The other half of the novel is Irulan&#x27;s chronicle of Paul&#x27;s early years, between &quot;House Corrino&quot; and &quot;Dune&quot;. &quot;The Winds of Dune&quot; (2009) is set between Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;11/29/09 blog&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, Paul&#x27;s disappearance into the desert has left a power vacuum, and Irulan and his other advisors struggle to determine what path his empire should take. &quot;Princess of Dune&quot; (2023) focuses on Irulan and Chani two years before the events of &quot;Dune&quot;.

== In adaptations ==
Director Alejandro Jodorowsky intended Amanda Lear to play Irulan in his planned 1970s film adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot;, which was never made. Irulan is portrayed by Virginia Madsen in the 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, and by Julie Cox in the 2000 TV miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; and its 2003 sequel, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;. Irulan does not appear in the 2021 film &quot;Dune&quot;, which covers the first part of the book, but does appear in the sequel film &quot;&quot;, where she is portrayed by Florence Pugh.

=== &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) ===
David Lynch&#x27;s 1984 film recreates Irulan&#x27;s narrative function literally, with the character narrating an introduction to the &quot;Dune&quot; universe, but only appearing briefly in person at the beginning and very end of the film. Michel Chion explained, &quot;Where Lynch has been most audacious is in the structuring of the story. He devised a kind of spiralling structure, described by him as circular, in which all the information needed to understand the story is given from the start rather than being doled out progressively. Via the voice of the narrating princess we are bombarded straight away with facts and names. Only later, little by little, are the facts allowed to find their meaning and the names their faces.&quot; Francesca Annis, who portrayed Lady Jessica in the film, said &quot;When I first went to see the film at the premiere ... as soon as Princess Irulan started to talk in voice-over at the beginning, explaining the story, I thought &#x27;Uh oh, this film is in trouble.&#x27; Any Hollywood film that has to explain itself in detail at the beginning is in trouble.&quot;

Madsen said that Helena Bonham Carter was originally cast in the role, but ended up having a scheduling conflict with the film &quot;A Room with a View&quot;. According to Madsen, there was a &quot;mad scramble&quot; to recast, and she was signed for &quot;Dune&quot; and two potential sequels. Madsen called the role her &quot;big break&quot; and said: &quot;Really all I had to do was that monologue, and I was really a glorified extra&quot;.

=== &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; (2000) ===
The 2000 miniseries, however, invents an extensive subplot for Irulan. Director John Harrison said that he felt the need to expand Irulan&#x27;s role because she plays such an important part in later books, and her epigraphs make her a significant presence in the novel. Additionally, the character gave him a window into House Corrino. Actress Julie Cox noted that Harrison made Irulan &quot;more of a love interest and to offset the weirdness of Paul marrying a stranger at the end&quot;.

In the miniseries, Irulan is sent to Arrakis to confirm Leto&#x27;s position, the presence of the Princess Royal meant to defray Leto&#x27;s suspicions about the Emperor&#x27;s motives. While there, she strikes up a friendship with his son, Paul. After the attack on the Atreides, Irulan immediately realizes that her father is the only one who could have possibly helped the Harkonnens, and expresses her displeasure at being used. Later on, Irulan spies on Reverend Mother Mohiam&#x27;s clandestine meeting with a Spacing Guild operative, and their conversation makes her realize that there is more to what is happening on Arrakis than meets the eye. Under the pretext of being bored, Irulan heads for the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime and coyly coerces Feyd into confirming her suspicions. As the Fremen uprising grows worse, Irulan ingratiates herself to her father&#x27;s council and offers valuable military advice. She is the only one of Shaddam&#x27;s advisers to realize the connection between Muad&#x27;Dib and Paul Atreides, the truth of which she reveals to the court upon Alia&#x27;s capture. Rather than simply agreeing to Paul&#x27;s demands, it is Irulan who actually suggests their marriage.

Besides the final scene, in which Irulan is betrothed to Paul, her only appearance in the miniseries based on an actual excerpt from the novel is her visit to Feyd. However, in the book it is a different Bene Gesserit, Margot Fenring, who visits the Harkonnen heir, on assignment from the Sisterhood to retrieve his genetic material (through conception) for their breeding program. The miniseries does not suggest this as Irulan&#x27;s motive, particularly since she hands Feyd off to one of her operatives before he can actually sleep with her.

Asher-Perrin called the expansion of Irulan&#x27;s role in the plot &quot;the smartest change&quot; from the novel, and noted the importance of Irulan as an expository tool in the miniseries. He wrote that &quot;Cox is elegant and cunning with the part, and makes Irulan&#x27;s own journey every bit as interesting as Paul&#x27;s on the flip side of the political machine.&quot; Austin Jones of &quot;Paste&quot; wrote, &quot;Julie Cox as Irulan is unquestionably a major highlight. She serves as a sympathetic eye in which to view House Corrino as her father plots with the Harkonnens for the downfall of House Atreides. Many of the performances in the miniseries are quite lacking ... but Cox brings a certain vivacity to an otherwise dense story. Much of the strength in &quot;Dune&quot; lies in the women guiding the plot from behind-the-scenes, and Irulan is undoubtedly a key player not to be trifled with alongside Jessica and Reverend Mother Mohiam.&quot;

=== &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot; (2003) ===
Cox reprised her role for the 2003 sequel &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot;, which covers the plot of both &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and &quot;Children of Dune&quot;.

Laura Fries of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;[Daniela] Amavia and Cox as the tortured Alia and the put-upon Irulan offer layered performances&quot;. Asher-Perrin praised Irulan&#x27;s &quot;complete character arc&quot; in the miniseries as an improvement to the character&#x27;s treatment in the source novels, and noted:

Asher-Perrin also wrote, &quot;There are other moments of perfect execution ... The dual conversations between Irulan and Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam—and later Jessica—are gorgeous, offering subtitles to their sign language while an entirely different conversation plays out in words.&quot;

=== &quot;Dune: Part Two&quot; (2024) ===

Irulan does not appear in Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s 2021 film &quot;Dune&quot;, which covers the first part of the book. Villeneuve dispensed with the novel&#x27;s framing epigraphs by Irulan, which according to Ryan Britt of &quot;Inverse&quot; leaves &quot;certain expository details&quot; and &quot;at least one political and historical side of &quot;Dune&quot;&quot; missing. David Crow of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; explained, &quot;Without [Irulan&#x27;s] interluding anecdotes about the man Paul Atreides will become (or at least is romanticized to be in Irulan&#x27;s texts), we are left to experience this story as Paul does: chronologically and in real time.&quot; Adrienne Westenfeld of &quot;Esquire&quot; called this a &quot;cinematic&quot; choice, and wrote,&quot;The result is a more fiercely interior experience of Paul&#x27;s journey to messianic prominence ... [and] to shift any sort of frame device from the royal Princess Irulan to the indigenous Chani is to provide a welcome juxtaposition to the frequent focus on noble political power brokers.&quot;

Irulan appeared in the 2024 sequel film &quot;&quot;. In March 2022, Florence Pugh entered negotiations to join the film&#x27;s cast as Irulan, and her role was confirmed in May 2022.

<text>Pulkovo Airport (, Internal code: ПЛК) is an international airport serving St. Petersburg, Russia. It is the 2nd-busiest airport in Russia and 29th-busiest airport in Europe. It consists of one terminal which is located south of the city centre. The airport serves as a hub for Aeroflot and Rossiya Airlines and as focus city for Smartavia. It is responsible for serving the citizens of Saint Petersburg and the Leningrad Oblast: a total of 6,120,000 people.

==Description==
Pulkovo Airport was officially opened on June 24, 1932, as a state-owned domestic airport. According to provisional figures for 2017, 16,125,520 passengers passed through the airport, a 21.6% increase over 2016. This makes Pulkovo the 4th busiest airport in Russia and the post-Soviet states. Pulkovo is one of the largest airports in Russia and Eastern Europe.

==History==
=== 1931–1986 ===
In January 1931, construction of an aerodrome near Leningrad (Saint Petersburg&#x27;s official name between 1924 and 1991 and the source of the airfield&#x27;s IATA code of &quot;LED&quot; ) commenced and was completed on 24 June 1932, with the first aircraft arriving at 17:31 that day, after a two-and-a-half hour flight from Moscow carrying passengers and mail. This aerodrome was at first named Shosseynaya Airport, the name coming from the nearby Shosseynaya railway station. Soon after, the airport opened regular flights to Petrozavodsk, Pudozh, Arkhangelsk, and Murmansk.

In 1936, a foundation for a new terminal was laid out. Leningrad&#x27;s airport was also provided with new G-2s and PS-84s. In 1941, a new completely commercial passenger route between Moscow and Leningrad was opened; before it was a mixed passenger-mail route. Construction of the new terminal thrived between 1937 and 1941. The architects of the new three-story terminal were Aleksandr Ivanovich Gegello and N.E. Lansere.
Construction was abruptly put on hold in July 1941, one month after Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of the USSR on 22 June 1941. The airport was the front line in the German Siege of Leningrad. There were no flights between 1941 and 1944. The nearby Pulkovo hills were occupied by the Germans and were used by German long-range artillery for daily bombardments of Leningrad. The airport was cleared of the Germans in January 1944, and cargo and mail flights were resumed after the runways were repaired in 1945. In February 1948, after the damage was completely repaired, the airport resumed scheduled passenger flights. In 1949, there were scheduled flights to 15 major cities of the USSR, and 15 more short-range flights within north-western Russia. In 1949, Shosseynaya Airport recorded a passenger traffic rate of 6,305, 333 tons of mail, and 708 tons of cargo.

In 1951, the construction of the new terminal was complete. In the mid-1950s the new extended runway was completed, allowing the airport to handle larger aircraft such as Ilyushin-18 and Tupolev-104. In that same time period, the use of jet engine planes began in Shosseynaya Airport. On 15 March 1959, the USSR-42419 Tu-104 was the first commercial jet airplane to take off from the Shosseynaya Airport.

In the early 1960s, modern regional airplanes such as the An-24 and Yak-40 began to appear in the airport. Flights to Vladivostok began to emerge in the flight lists. ICAO category 1 standards were implemented in 1965, making way for international operations. By the late 1960s, over 60 airlines had flights to and from Leningrad airport. On 8 February 1971, Shosseynaya was awarded the Order of the October Revolution. The airport was renamed Pulkovo Airport on 24 April 1973. In May 1973, the new Pulkovo 1 terminal was opened. The famous 5-cup Pulkovo 1 was designed by Alexandr Zyk. The 5 cups on top were put intentionally to give the terminal a more spacious feeling and allow more natural sunlight to pass through. This terminal is regarded as a masterpiece of Soviet postmodern architecture. Pulkovo 1 was a domestic-only terminal. Domestic air traffic increased by approximately 45% every decade between the 1970-1990s. The old pre-war building of the airport was renamed Pulkovo 2 and the terminal was exploited for international flights only.

On 11 April 1986, the new departure and arrival zones for the international terminal were completed, doubling the passenger traffic rate capacity of Pulkovo 1.

=== 1986–2007 ===

In 1990, Pulkovo Airport reached its passenger traffic rate peak of over 10,000,000 passengers. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of passengers declined. In 2005, Pulkovo Airport gained independence as it separated from the Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise. Also in 2005, Rosavia declares that Pulkovo Airport (still state-owned) is to have an open tender on an investment project of the new terminal construction. This allowed it to sell shares and begin working on investment bidding projects. In 2006, Pulkovo Airport served just over 5,000,000 passengers: only 50% of the number from 1990.

=== 2007–present ===

In 2007, Grimshaw Architects was announced as the winner of the construction contract. In 2009, the Saint Petersburg Transportation Ministry requested that an operating company for Pulkovo Airport be created, and a consortium known as NCG (Northern Capital Gateway) was set up by Russian VTB Capital Bank, international Fraport AG Company, and the Greek Copelouzos Group. On 29 April 2010, NCG won the tender for a 30-year operating lease over Pulkovo Airport. On 24 November 2010, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin attended a ceremony celebrating the beginning of construction on the new 150,000 m2 &quot;Terminal 1. &quot;

From 2020, the number of destinations is expected to increase rapidly, with up to 75% increase in passenger numbers forecast. This follows a five-year test agreement permitting non-Russian airlines to operate flights from multiple European destinations into the airport under an OpenSkies/Seventh-freedom traffic right The test follows an easing of visa requirements for many European nationals wishing to visit the St Petersburg region designed to increase tourism to the city through the airport.

On 31 January 2024, Ukrainian drones attacked an oil refinery near St. Petersburg. The Ukrainian drones and Russian air defence missiles fired to stop the attack led to all flights from the Pulkovo airport being suspended between 3:53 a.m. and 5:11 a.m.

==Terminals==



=== Pulkovo 1 ===
This historic terminal, opened in 1973, is . It was built for 6,500,000 passengers annually, but by 2008 it surpassed its maximum capacity. Since its reconstruction was completed in 2014, this terminal is now used for all passenger flights, domestic and international. It has several duty-free shops, restaurants, and 6 jet bridges. It was reported that when the reconstruction of Pulkovo 1 is completed, Pulkovo Airport&#x27;s capacity would increase to 17,000,000 passengers annually.

=== Terminal 1 ===
Construction of Terminal 1 was delayed several times but finally began in 2010. In November 2013, the airport was tested for errors by over 5,200 residents of Saint Petersburg who partook in the process. Several days after the test, the new Terminal 1 opened on December 3, 2013. On February 14, 2014, all operations were consolidated into the new terminal as the old Pulkovo 1 and Pulkovo 2 terminals have been shut down. The new terminal contains several business lounges, restaurants, pharmacies. Terminal 1 is 147,000 m2 and has 400,000 m2 airport dock in front of it. The airport has 88 check-in counters, 110 passport booths, 7 baggage carousels, 110 parking stands, 17 gates, and 17 escalators. The interior of the new airport was designed by Grimshaw Architects and directly correlates with the designs and style of Saint Petersburg city. The new Terminal also sought many artistic sculptures and paintings to give http://line-stargadget.ru/ a sense of thriving culture to passengers. Four sculptures from Dmitry Shorin&#x27;s project named &quot;I Believe in Angels&quot; decorate the departure hall.

The current Pulkovo-1 terminal includes the new terminal and the old Soviet terminal that was re-constructed and fully converted into the departure area.

==Airlines and destinations==
Due to the impact of aviation in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, destinations to the European Union, United Kingdom, Australasia, North America, Switzerland, Singapore, Northeast Asia, Taiwan, Iceland and Norway are suspended until further notice.

<text>Frank Lawrence Rosenthal (June 12, 1929 – October 13, 2008), also known as &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal, was an American professional sports gambler, Las Vegas casino executive, organized crime associate, and FBI informant. Rosenthal, who was once called &quot;the greatest living expert on sports gambling&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, is credited with bringing increased exposure to sports betting to Las Vegas in the 1970s.

Rosenthal&#x27;s life and career in Las Vegas served as the basis of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Casino&quot;, where he was portrayed by Robert De Niro and re-named Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein.

==Early years==

===Illinois===
Rosenthal was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a Jewish family and grew up on the city&#x27;s West Side. As a youth, he learned sports betting in the bleachers of Wrigley Field and would often skip classes to attend Chicago sporting events. Rosenthal&#x27;s father also owned racehorses, whereby he became familiar with betting odds and percentages at a young age.

By the mid-1950s, Rosenthal was working with the Chicago Outfit. Chosen for his expert odds-making ability, he ran the biggest illegal bookmaking office in the United States on behalf of the Mafia—specifically, the Outfit. Based in Cicero, Illinois, under the guise of a home improvement company, Rosenthal and the Outfit bought &quot;contracts&quot; to fix sporting events. After being indicted as a conspirator on multiple sports bribery charges, Rosenthal moved the operation to North Bay Village in Miami, Florida, to avoid attention.

===Miami===
By 1961, Rosenthal had acquired a national reputation as a sports bettor, oddsmaker, and handicapper, and in Miami he was frequently seen in the company of prominent Outfit members Jackie Cerone and Fiore Buccieri. At this time Rosenthal was issued with a subpoena to appear before U.S. Senator John McClellan&#x27;s subcommittee on Gambling and Organized Crime, accused of match-fixing. He invoked the Fifth Amendment 37 times and was never charged. Due to this, Rosenthal was barred from racing establishments in Florida.

Despite his frequent arrests for illegal gambling and bookmaking, Rosenthal was convicted only once, after pleading no contest in 1963 to allegedly bribing a New York University player to shave points for a college basketball game in North Carolina. He was also a suspect in multiple business and car bombings in the greater Miami area during the 1960s. It was at this time the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened an ongoing case file on Rosenthal which amassed 300 pages. In order to once again escape police attention, Rosenthal moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1968.

==Las Vegas career==
At age 40, Rosenthal began working as a pit boss at the Stardust, where his exceptional gambling knowledge became recognized, advancing him to the CEO position at Argent Corporation, owner of Nevada Properties. A major promoter of sports gambling, Rosenthal secretly ran the Stardust, Fremont, Marina, and Hacienda casinos when they were controlled by the Chicago Outfit. He also created the first sports book that operated from within a casino, making the Stardust one of the world&#x27;s leading centers for sports gambling. Another Rosenthal innovation was hiring more female blackjack dealers, which in one year helped double the Stardust&#x27;s income.

In 1976, the FBI and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) discovered that Rosenthal was secretly running four large casinos without obtaining a state gaming license, holding a hearing to determine his legal ability to obtain a license. The hearing was headed by Nevada Gaming Control Board Chairman (and future U.S. Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid. Rosenthal was denied a license because of his arrest record and his documented reputation as an organized crime associate, particularly because of his boyhood friendship with Chicago mob enforcer Anthony Spilotro.

Rosenthal married Geri McGee on May 4, 1969. McGee already had a daughter, Robin L. Marmor, from a previous marriage with ex-husband Lenny Marmor. Rosenthal and McGee later had two children together, Steven and Stephanie. There were infidelities on both sides, with McGee secretly having an affair with Spilotro. The marriage ended in divorce in 1981, with Rosenthal attributing the failure primarily to McGee&#x27;s inability to escape her dependence on alcohol and drugs. After leaving Rosenthal and stealing a portion of his savings, McGee died at a motel in Los Angeles on November 9, 1982, at age 46, of an apparent drug overdose. Her death was ruled accidental, from a combination of Valium, cocaine and alcohol.

==Later years and death==
On October 4, 1982, Rosenthal survived an assassination attempt in Las Vegas, in which a bomb attached to the gasoline tank was detonated when he started his car. The 1981 Cadillac Eldorado was in the parking lot of Tony Roma&#x27;s restaurant at 620 E. Sahara Avenue. Rosenthal survived because of a metal plate under the driver&#x27;s seat, installed by General Motors in the model to correct a balancing problem.

Myram Borders, who heard the explosion, said that after exiting the car Rosenthal shouted &quot;They&#x27;re trying to kill me, they&#x27;re trying to kill me!&quot;. When she asked who was trying to kill him, Rosenthal refused to say anything. Although no one was ever charged for the bombing, Milwaukee mob boss Frank Balistrieri was possibly responsible. Balistrieri, who was known as the &quot;Mad Bomber&quot; to law enforcement, was heard (via wiretap) blaming Rosenthal for the legal problems the mob-controlled casinos were suffering. Similarly, just weeks before the bombing, Balistrieri told his sons he intended to get &quot;full satisfaction&quot; for Rosenthal&#x27;s perceived wrongdoing. Other likely suspects include Kansas City mob bosses, who were recorded on an FBI wiretap tape calling Rosenthal &quot;crazy&quot;; Spilotro, either acting with others or on behalf of the Outfit; and outlaw bikers who were friends of Rosenthal&#x27;s ex-wife, Geri McGee.

Rosenthal left Las Vegas about six months later, and moved to Laguna Niguel, California. He focused on raising his children, who were both accomplished youth swimmers. Rosenthal was later formally banned from Las Vegas casinos in 1987, when he was placed in &quot;the Black Book&quot;, making him &quot;persona non grata&quot;—unable to work in, or even enter, any Nevada casino because of his alleged ties to organized crime. However, in June 1990, Rosenthal won an unprecedented court ruling to have his name removed. Rosenthal was represented in the hearing by future Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman. Goodman and Rosenthal lost, however, in the Nevada Supreme Court in 1991, and Rosenthal&#x27;s ban was reinstated.

Rosenthal later moved from Laguna Niguel to Boca Raton, Florida, where he ran a sports bar called &quot;Croc&#x27;s&quot;, and finally to Miami Beach, where he ran a sports betting website and worked as a consultant for several offshore sports betting companies.

Rosenthal died on October 13, 2008, at the age of 79, of an apparent heart attack. After his death, it was disclosed by &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; reporter Jane Ann Morrison that Rosenthal had been a top echelon informant for the FBI, and his wife Geri was also an FBI informant.

In 2011, the US government released Frank Rosenthal&#x27;s FBI records to the public.

==In popular culture==
The film &quot;Casino&quot; (1995), directed by Martin Scorsese with a screenplay co-written by Nicholas Pileggi from his biography &quot;&quot;, is largely based on Rosenthal&#x27;s time in Las Vegas. The film takes some creative license, but is broadly accurate to Rosenthal&#x27;s story and his relationship with Anthony Spilotro, on which the character Nicky Santoro (played by Joe Pesci) is based. Rosenthal is represented by the character Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (played by Robert De Niro). The character of Ginger McKenna Rothstein, his wife in the film (played by Sharon Stone), is based on Geri McGee, Rosenthal&#x27;s wife in real life.

In an interview about the movie, Rosenthal stated that his character portrayed by Robert De Niro was quite but not fully similar to him, namely &quot;7 on a scale of 1 to 10&quot;, and when asked about Stone’s portrayal of his wife, he stated, &quot;I really wouldn&#x27;t want to get into that area. It&#x27;s an area that is distasteful and brings back bad memories. I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to dispute what you just said, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t confirm it.&quot;

<doc id="729867" wikidata="Q954995" url="?curid=729867" title="Compline">
<text>Compline ( ), also known as Complin, Night Prayer, or the Prayers at the End of the Day, is the final prayer liturgy (or office) of the day in the Christian tradition of canonical hours, which are prayed at fixed prayer times.

The English word is derived from the Latin , as compline is the completion of the waking day. The word was first used in this sense about the beginning of the 6th century in the &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot; (&quot;Regula Benedicti&quot;; hereafter, RB), in Chapters 16, 17, 18, and 42, and he uses the verb &quot;compleo&quot; to signify compline: &quot;Omnes ergo in unum positi compleant&quot; (&quot;All having assembled in one place, let them say compline&quot;); &quot;et exeuntes a completorio&quot; (&quot;and, after going out from compline&quot;)… (RB, Chap. 42).

Compline liturgies are a part of Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, and certain other Christian liturgical traditions.

In Western Christianity, Compline tends to be a contemplative office that emphasizes spiritual peace. In most monasteries it is the custom to begin the &quot;Great Silence&quot; after compline, during which the whole community, including guests, observes silence throughout the night until after the Terce the next day. Compline comprises the final office in the Liturgy of the Hours.

== Historical development ==
:&quot;This section incorporates information from the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1917. References to psalms follow the numbering system of the Septuagint, as said in the Latin of the Vulgate.&quot;
From the time of the early Church, the practice of seven fixed prayer times has been taught; in &quot;Apostolic Tradition&quot;, Hippolytus instructed Christians to pray seven times a day &quot;on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight&quot; and &quot;the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ&#x27;s Passion.&quot;

The origin of compline has given rise to considerable discussion among liturgists. In the past, general opinion ascribed the origin of this liturgical hour to St. Benedict, at the beginning of the 6th century. But Jules Pargoire and A. Vandepitte trace its source to Saint Basil. Vandepitte states that it was not in Cæsarea in 375, but in his retreat in Pontus (358–362), that Basil established compline, which hour did not exist prior to his time, that is, until shortly after the middle of the 4th century. also traced the source of compline back to the 4th century, finding mention of it in a passage in Eusebius and in another in St. Ambrose, and also in John Cassian. These texts bear witness to the private custom of saying a prayer before retiring to rest. If this was not the canonical hour of compline, it was certainly a preliminary step towards it. The same writers reject the opinion of Paulin Ladeuze and who believe that compline had a place in the Rule of St. Pachomius, which would mean that it originated still earlier in the 4th century.

The Catholic Encyclopedia argues that, if St. Basil instituted and organized the hour of compline for the East, as St. Benedict did for the West, there existed as early as the days of St. Cyprian and Clement of Alexandria the custom of reciting a prayer before sleep, and that this might be taken as the original source of compline.

==Compline in the Roman Rite==

It is generally thought that the Benedictine form of compline is the earliest western order, although some scholars, such as Plaine, have maintained that the hour of compline as found in the Roman Breviary at his time, antedated the Benedictine Office. These debates apart, Benedict&#x27;s arrangement probably invested the hour of compline with the liturgical character and arrangement which were preserved in the Benedictine Order, and largely adopted by the Roman Church. The original form of the Benedictine Office, lacking even an antiphon for the psalms, is much simpler than its Roman counterpart, resembling more closely the Minor Hours of the day.

Saint Benedict first gave the Office the basic structure by which it has come to be celebrated in the West: three psalms (4, 90, and 133) (Vulgate numbering) said without antiphons, the hymn, the lesson, the versicle &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot;, the benediction, and the dismissal (RB, Chaps. 17 and 18).

The Roman Office of compline came to be richer and more complex than the simple Benedictine psalmody. A fourth psalm was added, &quot;In te Domine speravi&quot; (Psalm 30 in Vulgate). And perhaps at a fairly late date was added the solemn introduction of a benediction with a reading (based perhaps on the spiritual reading which, in the Rule of St. Benedict, precedes compline: RB, Chap. 42), and the confession and absolution of faults. This is absent from parallel forms, such as that of Sarum.

The distinctive character and greater solemnity of the Roman form of compline comes from the responsory,&quot; In manus tuas, Domine&quot; (&quot;Into Thy hands, O Lord&quot;), with the evangelical canticle Nunc Dimittis and its anthem, which is particularly characteristic.

The hour of compline, such as it appeared in the Roman Breviary prior to the Second Vatican Council, may be divided into several parts, viz. the beginning or introduction, the psalmody, with its usual accompaniment of antiphons, the hymn, the &quot;capitulum&quot;, the response, the &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot;, the prayer, and the benediction.

By way of liturgical variety, the liturgy of &quot;initium noctis&quot; may also be studied in the Celtic Liturgy, such as it is read in the Antiphonary of Bangor, its plan being set forth by Warren and by Bishop (see Bibliography, below).
In the breviary of 1974 Roman Catholic Liturgy of the Hours, compline is divided as follows: introduction, an optional examination of conscience or penitential rite, a hymn, psalmody with accompanying antiphons, scriptural reading, the responsory, the Canticle of Simeon, concluding prayer, and benediction. The final antiphon to the Blessed Virgin Mary (&quot;Salve Regina&quot;, etc.) is an essential part of the Office.

==Lutheran usage==
The office of Compline (along with the other daily offices) is included in the various Lutheran hymnals, books of worship and prayer books, such as the Lutheran Service Book and &quot;For All the Saints: A Prayer Book for and by the Church&quot;. In some Lutheran Churches, compline may be conducted by a layperson with a slight modification to the liturgy. In the Lutheran Service Book, used by the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod, Compline consists of opening versicles from Psalm 92, confession of sins, psalmody, an office hymn, readings from scripture, responsory, prayer (concluded with the Lord&#x27;s Prayer), the Nunc Dimittis, and benediction.

==Anglican usage==

In the Anglican tradition, Compline was originally merged with Vespers to form Evening Prayer in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. The United States Episcopal Church&#x27;s &quot;Book of Offices&quot; of 1914, the Church of England&#x27;s 1928 proposed prayer book, the Scottish Episcopal Church&#x27;s 1929 Scottish Prayer Book, the Anglican Church of Canada&#x27;s 1959/1962 prayer book, and also the 2004 version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; for the Church of Ireland, along with the 2009 &quot;Daily Prayer&quot; book of the Church in Wales, restored a form of compline to Anglican worship. Several contemporary liturgical texts, including the American 1979 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the Anglican Church of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Book of Alternative Services&quot;, and the Church of England&#x27;s &quot;Common Worship&quot;, provide modern forms of the service. A traditional form is provided in the 1991 Anglican Service Book. The &quot;Common Worship&quot; service consists of the opening sentences, the confession of sins, the psalms and other Bible lessons, the canticle of Simeon, and prayers, including a benediction. There are authorized alternatives for the days of the week and the seasons of the Christian year. As a public service of worship, like Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, compline may be led by a layperson, quite similar to Lutheran use.

==Compline in Byzantine usage==
Compline is called literally, the after-supper (Greek (&quot;τὸ&quot;) &quot;Ἀπόδειπνον&quot; , Slavonic &quot;повечеріе&quot;, Povecheriye), has two distinct forms which are quite different in length Small Compline and Great Compline.

Both forms include a canon, typically those found Octoechos to the Theotokos, although alternative canons are used on certain forefeasts, afterfeasts and days during the Paschaltide. A further exception is on days when the liturgy to the saint(s) of the day is displaced by, e.g., by a newly canonized or locally venerated saint (or icon), the displaced canon is used and after that are inserted the stichera prescribed for vespers.

The Office always ends with a mutual asking of forgiveness. In some traditions, most notably among the Russians, Evening Prayers (i.e., Prayers Before Sleep) are read at the end of compline. It is an ancient custom, practiced on the Holy Mountain and in other monasteries, for everyone present at the end of compline to venerate the relics and icons in the church, and receive the priest&#x27;s blessing.

===Small Compline===
Small compline is prescribed for most nights of the year. It is presided over by a single priest without a deacon.

The liturgy is composed of three Psalms (50, 69, 142), the Small Doxology, the Nicene Creed, the Canon followed by &quot;Axion Estin&quot;, the Trisagion, Troparia for the day, &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; (40 times), the Prayer of the Hours, the Supplicatory Prayer of Paul the Monk, and the Prayer to Jesus Christ of Antiochus the Monk. Following these are the mutual forgiveness and final blessing by the priest and the priest&#x27;s reciting of a litany.

Before an all-night vigil, compline in the Greek tradition precedes great vespers, being read during the great incensing, while in Russian tradition it simply follows little vespers.

===Great Compline===
Great Compline is a penitential daily office which is served on the following occasions:
* Tuesday and Thursday nights of Cheesefare Week, the week proceeding Great Lent
* Monday through Thursday nights of Great Lent
* Friday nights of Great Lent
* Monday and Tuesday of Holy Week
* Monday through Friday during the lesser Lenten seasons: Nativity Fast, Apostles&#x27; Fast, and Dormition Fast
* The Eves of certain Great Feasts, as a part of the All-Night Vigil: Nativity, Theophany, and Annunciation.

Unlike Small Compline, Great Compline has portions of the liturgy which are chanted by the Choir and during Lent the Prayer of St. Ephraim is said with prostrations. During the First Week of Great Lent, the Great Canon of Saint Andrew of Crete is divided into four portions and read on Monday through Thursday nights.

Due to the penitential nature of Great Compline, it is not uncommon for the priest to hear Confession during or immediately following the liturgy.

Great Compline is composed of three sections, each beginning with the call to prayer, &quot;O come, let us worship…&quot;:

First Part
:Psalms 4, 6, and 12; Glory…, etc.; Psalms 24, 30, 90; then the hymn &quot;God is With Us&quot; and troparia, the Creed, the hymn &quot;O Most holy Lady Theotokos&quot;, the Trisagion and Troparia of the Day, &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; (40 times), &quot;More honorable than the cherubim…&quot; and the Prayer of St. Basil the Great.

Second Part
:Psalms 50, 101, and the Prayer of Manasses; the Trisagion, and Troparia of Repentance, &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; (40 times), &quot;More honorable than the cherubim…&quot; and the Prayer of St. Mardarius.

Third Part
:Psalms 69, 142, and the Small Doxology; then the Canon followed by &quot;Axion Estin&quot;, the Trisagion, the hymn &quot;O Lord of Hosts, be with us…&quot;, &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; (40 times), the Prayer of the Hours, &quot;More honorable than the cherubim…&quot;, the Prayer of St. Ephraim, Trisagion (this depends on tradition, it is not always recited here), the Supplicatory Prayer of Paul the Monk to the Theotokos, and the Prayer to Jesus Christ of Antiochus the Monk. Then the mutual forgiveness. Instead of the normal final blessing by the priest, all prostrate themselves while the priest reads a special intercessory prayer. Then the litany and the veneration of icons and relics.

==Oriental Christian usages==
===Syriac Orthodox Church, Indian Orthodox Church, and Mar Thoma Syrian Church===
In the Syriac Orthodox Church and Indian Orthodox Church, as well as the Mar Thoma Syrian Church (an Oriental Protestant denomination), the office of Compline is also known as Soutoro and is prayed at 9 pm using the Shehimo breviary.

===Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria===
In the Coptic Orthodox Church, an Oriental Orthodox denomination, the Compline is prayed at 9 pm using the Agpeya breviary before retiring.

===Armenian Liturgy: Hours of Peace and Rest===
There are two offices in the daily worship of the Armenian Apostolic Church which are recited between sundown and sleep: the Peace Hour and the Rest Hour. These are two distinct liturgies of communal worship. It is the usage in some localities to combine these two liturgies, with abbreviations, into a single liturgy.

====The Peace Hour====

The Peace Hour (Armenian: Խաղաղական Ժամ &quot;khaghaghakan zham&quot;) is the office associated with compline in other Christian liturgies.

In the Armenian Book of Hours, or Zhamagirk`, it is stated that the Peace Hour commemorates the Spirit of God, but also the Word of God, “when he was laid in the tomb and descended into Hades, and brought peace to the spirits.”

Outline of the Peace Hour

If the Song of Steps is recited: &quot;Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our Father … Amen.&quot;; Psalm 34:1–7: &quot;I have blessed the Lord at all times ()&quot;…; &quot;Glory to the Father&quot; (Always with &quot;Now and always … Amen&quot;.; &quot;And again in peace let us pray to the Lord…&quot;; &quot;Blessing and glory to the Father … Amen.&quot;; Song of Steps: Psalm 120:1–3: &quot;In my distress I cried ()&quot;…; &quot;Glory to the Father…&quot;

If the Song of Steps is not said: &quot;Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our father … Amen&quot;; Psalm 88:1–2 &quot;God of my salvation ()&quot;…; &quot;Glory to the Father…&quot;; &quot;And again in peace let us pray to the Lord …&quot;; &quot;Blessing and glory to the Father … Amen.&quot;; &quot;Peace with all.&quot;

In either case the liturgy continues here: Psalms 4, 6, 13, 16, 43, 70, 86:16–17; &quot;Glory to the Father…&quot;; Song: &quot;Vouchsafe unto us (Shnorhea mez)…&quot;; &quot;Glory to the Father…&quot;; Acclamation: &quot;At the approach of darkness (I merdzenal erekoyis)…&quot;; Proclamation: &quot;And again in peace … Let us give thanks to the Lord ()…&quot;; Prayer: &quot;Beneficent Lord (Tēr Barerar)…&quot;; Psalm 27 &quot;The Lord is my light (Tēr loys im)…&quot;; &quot;Glory to the Father…&quot;; Song: &quot;Look down with love (Nayats` sirov)…&quot;; Acclamation: &quot;Lord, do not turn your face ()…&quot;; Proclamation: &quot;And again in peace … Let us beseech almighty God (Aghach`ests`ouk` zamenakal&quot;)…; Prayer: &quot;Bestowing with grace (Shnorhatou bareats`)&quot;…

On non-fasting days the liturgy ends here with: &quot;Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our father … Amen&quot;.

On fasting days continue here: Psalm 119; &quot;Glory to the Father–&quot;; Hymn: &quot;We entreat you (I k`ez hayts`emk`)…&quot;

During the Great Fast: Evening Chant (varies); Acclamation: &quot;To the spirits at rest ()…&quot;; Proclamation: &quot;And again in peace … For the repose of the souls (Vasn hangouts`eal)…; Lord, have mercy&quot; (thrice); Prayer: &quot;Christ, Son of God ()…; Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our father… Amen.”&quot;

====The Rest Hour====

The Rest Hour (Armenian: Հանգստեան Ժամ ) is celebrated after the Peace Hour, and is the last of the offices of the day. It may be considered communal worship before sleep. It bears some resemblance in content to compline in the Roman Rite.

In the Armenian Book of Hours it is stated in many manuscripts that the Rest Hour commemorates God the Father, “that he protect us through the protecting arm of the Onlybegotten in the darkness of night.”

Outline of the Rest Hour: &quot;Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our Father … Amen.&quot;; Psalm 43:3–5: &quot;Lord, send your light and your truth (Arak`ea Tēr)…&quot;; &quot;Glory to the Father…; And again in peace let us pray to the Lord …; Blessing and glory to the Father … Amen.;&quot; Psalms 119:41–56, 119:113–120, 119:169–176, 91, 123, 54, Daniel 3:29–34, Luke 2:29–32, Psalms 142:7, 86:16–17, 138:7–8, Luke 1:46–55; &quot;Glory to the Father…&quot;; Acclamation: &quot;My soul into your hands ()…&quot;; Proclamation: &quot;And again in peace … Let us beseech almighty God (Aghach`ests`ouk` zamenakaln)…&quot;; Prayer: &quot;Lord our God (Tēr Astouats mer)…&quot;

&quot;Ending:&quot; Psalm 4; Pre-gospel sequence; Gospel: John 12:24ff; &quot;Glory to you, our God&quot;; Proclamation: &quot;By the holy Cross (Sourb khach`ivs…)…&quot;; Prayer: &quot;Protect us (; &quot;Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our Father … Amen.&quot;

Ending during Fasts: Acclamation: &quot;We fall down before you (Ankanimk` araji k`o)…&quot;; Meditation Twelve of St. Gregory of Narek; Meditation 94 of St. Gregory of Narek; Meditation 41 of St. Gregory of Narek; Prayer: &quot;In faith I confess (Havatov khostovanim)…&quot; by St. Nerses the Graceful; Acclamation: &quot;Through your holy spotless and virgin mother (Vasn srbouhvoy)…&quot;; Proclamation: &quot;Holy Birthgiver of God (Sourb zAstouatsatsinn), ,&quot;; Prayer: &quot;Accept, Lord (Unkal, Tēr)…&quot;; &quot;Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our Father … Amen.&quot;

<text>Paul Marshall Johnson Jr. (May 8, 1955 – ) was an American helicopter engineer who lived in Saudi Arabia. In 2004, he was taken hostage by militants and his murder was recorded on video tape.

== Background ==
Johnson was born in Eagleswood Township, New Jersey. He graduated from Southern Regional High School in 1973.

==Abduction and death==

On June 12, 2004, Johnson, who worked for Lockheed Martin on upgrading Saudi AH-64A Apache attack helicopters, was stopped at a fake police checkpoint near Riyadh and then abducted. His kidnappers called themselves Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The group, headed by Abdel Aziz al-Muqrin, posted a video of a blindfolded Johnson on an Islamist website on June 15, 2004 and threatened to kill him unless all al-Qaeda prisoners were released from Saudi jails within 72 hours.

Immediately after the video was released, American and Saudi Arabian authorities began to deal with the hostage situation. Both the United States and Saudi Arabia asserted that they would not comply with the kidnappers&#x27; demands. Those demands included, but were not limited to, releasing all militants being held in Saudi custody. The video was released on the same day that Crown Prince Abdullah promised to step up security and investigations against militant Islamic groups in Saudi Arabia.

One of Johnson&#x27;s Saudi colleagues, Abdullah Al-Momin, published a petition message to the kidnappers through Al-Arabiya TV. He asked them in the name of Islam to free Johnson as he has nothing to do with the American military. &quot;If they are really Muslims they should release him&quot; Abdullah said.

Johnson&#x27;s abduction came during increased violence against foreigners in Saudi Arabia. The previous week, BBC journalists Frank Gardner and Simon Cumbers had been shot, and two other Americans had also been shot in Riyadh.

Sultan Al Haseri was later to be described as taking a role in Johnson&#x27;s kidnapping and murder. He was subsequently listed on Saudi Arabia&#x27;s list of most wanted terrorist suspects and killed in a shootout in July 2005.

==Videotaped killing==
At 17:30 UTC on June 18, Al-Arabiya and CNN reported that Johnson had been decapitated. This report was based on three photographs of the murder posted on the Internet. Saudi officials initially claimed to have discovered Johnson&#x27;s body near Riyadh later that day, but the statements were withdrawn the following day on June 19. The Saudi government withheld official proclamation of Johnson&#x27;s death until the body was found.
In the murder video, after making the statements, the next shot is the execution already in progress. He is lying on a bed with what appears to be three men holding him down as one militant severs his head. Unlike the Nick Berg and Eugene Armstrong videos, there is no screaming. The video was also similar to that of Daniel Pearl, who was killed in Pakistan in 2002, and Kim Sun-il, a South Korean translator who was killed in Iraq during the same month not long after Johnson was killed in Saudi Arabia.

HostingAnime, the company which hosts images and video of his murder, have defended showing his execution.

On July 21, 2004, Saudi security officials found Johnson&#x27;s head in a refrigerator in the residence of Issa Al-Khalidi, following a shootout in Riyadh with Saudi security forces in which Al-Khalidi was killed. Issa&#x27;s brothers, Abd Al Aziz Sad Muhaamad Awshan Al-Khalidi and Suleyman Saaed Mohammed Al-Khalidi, were later detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

<text>Association football has been included in every Summer Olympic Games as a men&#x27;s competition sport, except 1896 (the inaugural Games) and 1932 (in an attempt to promote the new FIFA World Cup tournament). Women&#x27;s football was added to the official program at the Atlanta 1996 Games.

In order to avoid competition with the World Cup, FIFA have restricted participation of elite players in the men&#x27;s tournament in various ways: currently, squads for the men&#x27;s tournament are required to be composed of players under 23 years of age, with three permitted exceptions.

By comparison, the women&#x27;s football tournament is a full senior-level international tournament, second in prestige only to the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

Another major difference between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments is that the men&#x27;s tournament is not included in the FIFA International Match Calendar, while the women&#x27;s tournament is included. This in turn means that clubs are not required to release players for the men&#x27;s tournament, but must release players for the women&#x27;s event.

==History==

===Pre-World Cup era===

====Beginnings====
Football was not included in the program at the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, as international football was in its infancy at the time. However, sources claim that an unofficial football tournament was organised during the first competition, with participating teams including Athens and Smyrna (İzmir), then part of the Ottoman Empire. However, according to Bill Mallon&#x27;s research, this is an error which has been perpetuated in multiple texts.

Tournaments were played at the 1900 and 1904 games and the Intercalated Games of 1906, but these were contested by various clubs and scratch teams. Although the IOC considers the 1900 and 1904 tournaments to be official Olympic events, they are not recognised by FIFA, and neither recognises the Intercalated Games today. In 1900 the competition was won by the London amateurs of Upton Park FC, representing Great Britain. The 1904 tournament was won by Canada, represented by Galt FC.

====British successes====
In the London Games of 1908 a proper international tournament was organised by the Football Association, featuring just six teams. The number of teams rose to eleven in 1912, when the competition was organised by the Swedish Football Association. Many of these early matches were unbalanced, as evidenced by high scoring games; two players, Sophus Nielsen in 1908 and Gottfried Fuchs in 1912, each scored ten goals in a single match. All players were amateurs, in accordance with the Olympic rules, which meant that countries could not send their full senior national teams. The National Olympic Committee for Great Britain and Ireland asked the Football Association to send an English national amateur team. Some of the English members played with professional clubs, most notably Derby County&#x27;s Ivan Sharpe, Bradford City F.C. Harold Walden and Chelsea&#x27;s Vivian Woodward. England won the first two official tournaments convincingly, beating Denmark both times.

====1920s and the rise of Uruguay====

During the 1920 final against Belgium, the Czechoslovakia national football team walked off the field to protest the refereeing of John Lewis and the militarised mood within the stadium in Antwerp. This would be the final all-European football competition at the Olympic games, with Egypt, the United States, and Uruguay participating in 1924. With teams from new regions the quality of play increased, as did fan interest. Uruguay dominated the tournament, winning their four games by a combined score of 15-1: the final was a 3–0 victory over Switzerland. In 1928, football was the most popular event at the games and the final was an all-South American affair. Because no other major international tournament existed yet, Uruguay defeated Argentina 2–1 in what David Goldblatt says was &quot;football&#x27;s first world championship&quot;. After these tournaments, FIFA realized that the Olympic movement prevented nations from competing on an equal footing and, given that the Olympics only permitted amateurs to participate, did not represent the true strength of the international game. The popularity of international soccer gave FIFA the incentive to create an international tournament, and FIFA began organising the World Cup.

===After the first World Cup===

====Tumultuous &#x27;30s====
Following Jules Rimet&#x27;s proposal in 1929 to initiate a professional World Championship of Football, the sport was dropped from the 1932 Los Angeles Games by FIFA in an attempt to promote the new tournament. Football returned to controversy at the 1936 Berlin Games. The German organisers were intent on the return of the game to the Olympic movement since it guaranteed income into the organisation&#x27;s coffers. The Italian team intimidated a referee. Peru scored a contested victory over Austria in overtime, with a fan invasion of the field at the very end. The Austrian team asked for the result to be annulled, and the game repeated. FIFA agreed, but the Peruvian team refused and left the Olympics.

====Soviet Bloc dominance amid amateurism controversy====
As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. As a result, young Western amateurs had to face seasoned and veteran Soviet Bloc teams, which put them at a significant disadvantage. All Olympic football tournaments from 1948 to 1980 were dominated by the Soviet Union and its satellites. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 28 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960), and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. The next two tournaments saw some changes due to FIFA&#x27;s changing of the call-up rules, with only Yugoslavia (bronze in 1984) and the Soviet Union (gold in 1988) winning medals for the Eastern Bloc.

====Changes and developments====
For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC decided to admit professional players, however, FIFA still did not want the Olympics – or any other men’s soccer competitions to rival the World Cup.

A compromise was struck that allowed teams from countries outside of UEFA and CONMEBOL to field their strongest sides, while restricting UEFA and CONMEBOL (the strongest confederations whose teams had played all finals and won every single World Cup title) countries to players who had not played in a World Cup.

The 1984 rules were maintained also for the 1988 edition, but with an additional rider: any European and South American footballers who had previously played less than 90 minutes in one single match of the World Cup, were eligible.

====1992–present: Age restrictions introduced====
Since 1992, male competitors have been required to be under 23 years old, and since 1996, a maximum of three over-23-year-old players have been allowed per squad. African countries have taken particular advantage of this, with Nigeria and Cameroon winning in 1996 and 2000 respectively.

Because of the unusual format and the separation from the main national teams that play the World Cup and top continental tournaments, historically strong men&#x27;s national teams have unimpressive Olympic records. Uruguay, who won the two tournaments prior to the World Cup&#x27;s creation, only qualified again in 2012, after an 84-year absence. Argentina won silver twice (1928 and 1996) before the 2004 tournament, but its appearance in Athens 2004, in which it won the first gold medal, was only their seventh overall. Brazil&#x27;s silver medals in the 1984, 1988 and 2012 editions were the best they had achieved until back-to-back golds in 2016 and 2020, the former on home soil. Italy has only won the Olympic title once, in 1936, although along with the two bronzes, the team has the highest number of appearances in the tournament, with 15, the last in 2008. France won the Olympic title in 1984, but only qualified twice ever since. A team from Germany won the gold medal only once, in 1976 (East Germany), and the reunified team did not make an Olympic appearance until 2016, when they won silver. Spain has won gold in 1992 and 2024, the former as hosts, and followed it with two silver medals (in 2000 and 2020, having also won a third in 1920), along with a few failures to qualify.

===British non-involvement===

Football in the United Kingdom has no single governing body, and there are separate teams for the UK&#x27;s four Home Nations: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Further to this, only the English Football Association (FA) is affiliated to the British Olympic Association (BOA), and the FA entered &quot;Great Britain&quot; teams to the football tournaments until 1972.

In 1950, the FA abolished the distinction between &quot;amateur&quot; and &quot;professional&quot; football, and ceased to enter the Olympics. Even though FIFA has allowed professionals at the Olympics since 1984, the FA did not re-enter, as the Home Nations were concerned that a united British Olympic team would set a precedent that might cause FIFA to question their separate status in other FIFA competitions, and even their status on or the existence of the International Football Association Board.

When London was selected to host the 2012 Games, there was pressure on the English FA to exercise the host nation&#x27;s automatic right to field a team. In 2009 the plan agreed by the FA with the Welsh FA, Scottish FA and Irish FA was only to field English players; however the BOA overruled this, and ultimately there were Welsh players in the men&#x27;s squad and Scots players in the women&#x27;s squad. After the 2012 games, the FA decided that no team would be entered in subsequent men&#x27;s tournaments, but was open to fielding a women&#x27;s team again. The distinction recognised the importance and status of Olympic football in the women&#x27;s international game.

For the 2020 tournament, FIFA stated that the women&#x27;s UK team (not applied to the men&#x27;s UK team) may enter the Olympics after the four FAs agreed, depending on the performance of women&#x27;s English team in 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup (which serves as the European qualification for the Olympics). This brought women&#x27;s football under the BOA jurisdiction in line with the long-standing qualification rules in field hockey and rugby sevens, although the home nation&#x27;s sevens teams were subsumed into a standing Great Britain team in 2022.

==Venues==
Due to the number of large stadia required for the Olympic tournament, venues in distant cities – often more than away from the main host – are typically used for the football tournament. In an extreme example, two early-round venues for the 1984 Games were on the East Coast of the United States, well over from the host city of Los Angeles. The next Games held in the United States, the 1996 Games, were unique in that no matches were held in the host city of Atlanta; the nearest venue and the site of the finals was away on the University of Georgia campus in Athens. Counting the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics, there are 127 venues that have hosted Olympic football, the most of any sport.

==Events==
==Competition format==
From the 1992 Summer Olympics Football games always start before the opening ceremony because of the event&#x27;s calendar which needs to be longer than other sports. Since 1996, football starts two days before the games opening ceremonies and since then it is a common condition for some sports.

For both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments, the competition consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a knockout stage. Teams are placed into groups of 4 teams, with each team playing each other team in its group once. Teams earn 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. The top two teams in each group (as well as the top two third-place finishers, in the women&#x27;s tournament) advance to the knockout rounds. The knockout rounds are a single-elimination tournament consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals, and the gold and bronze medal matches.

Matches consist of two halves of 45 minutes each. Since 2004, during the knockout rounds, if the match is tied after 90 minutes, two 15-minute halves of extra time are played (extra time is skipped in favour of immediate penalty kicks in the bronze medal match if it is played on the same day in the same stadium as the gold medal match). If the score remains tied, penalty kicks, which is 5 rounds, plus extra rounds if tied, are used to determine the winner.

The qualifying tournament, like that for the World Cup, is organised along continental lines. Most continental confederations organise a special Under-23 qualifying tournament, although the European qualifiers are drawn from the finalists of the UEFA Under-21 Championship. Teams participating in the preliminary and final competitions must be composed of U-23 players, with up to three players who are at least 23. For Paris 2024, U-23 players were born after 1 January 2001.

For the 2024 Games, the number of places allocated to each continent is:
*Europe – 4 (includes host France)
*Asia – 3 or 4
*Africa – 3 or 4
*South America – 2
*North America – 2
*Oceania – 1

==Women&#x27;s tournament==

The women&#x27;s tournament is contested between the full senior national teams, with no restrictions. One place is reserved for the host country. Of the remaining teams, as in World Cup contests, a specific number of places are reserved for teams from each continental region; the European (UEFA) teams until 2020 are chosen from the most successful European teams in the previous year&#x27;s World Cup; the UEFA Women&#x27;s Nations League which its finals is held in the same year as the Olympics was used from 2024, while the other continental regions host their own qualifying tournaments in the build-up to the Olympics.

The first women&#x27;s tournament was at the 1996 Atlanta Games. The United States won the gold medal. Norway defeated the U.S. in 2000 by a golden goal that was highly controversial and seemed like a handball, but was allowed to stand. The finals of the next two tournaments, in 2004 and 2008, also went to extra time, with the U.S. defeating Brazil both times. In 2012 the U.S. won their fourth gold medal defeating Japan 2–1 in the final. In 2016 Germany won its first gold, defeating in the final Sweden, who upset in the succession the U.S. and hosts Brazil. In 2020, Canada won gold on penalties over Sweden, having previously also beaten Brazil and the U.S.

Allocation of places for each continent in the 2024 Games was:
*Europe – 3 (includes host France)
*Africa – 2
*Asia – 2
*South America – 2

<text>A microreactor or microstructured reactor or microchannel reactor is a device in which chemical reactions take place in a confinement with typical lateral dimensions below 1 mm;
the most typical form of such confinement are microchannels. Microreactors are studied in the field of micro process engineering, together with other devices (such as micro heat exchangers) in which physical processes occur. The microreactor is usually a continuous flow reactor (contrast with/to a batch reactor). Microreactors can offer many advantages over conventional scale reactors, including improvements in energy efficiency, reaction speed and yield, safety, reliability, scalability, on-site/on-demand production, and a much finer degree of process control.

==History==
Gas-phase microreactors have a long history but those involving liquids started to appear in the late 1990s. One of the first microreactors with embedded high performance heat exchangers were made in the early 1990s by the Central Experimentation Department (&quot;Hauptabteilung Versuchstechnik&quot;, HVT) of Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe
in Germany, using mechanical micromachining techniques that were a spinoff from the manufacture of separation nozzles for uranium enrichment. As research on nuclear technology was drastically reduced in Germany, microstructured heat exchangers were investigated for their application in handling highly exothermic and dangerous chemical reactions. This new concept, known by names as microreaction technology or micro process engineering, was further developed by various research institutions. An early example from 1997 involved that of azo couplings in a pyrex reactor with channel dimensions 90 micrometres deep and 190 micrometres wide.

==Benefits==
Using microreactors is somewhat different from using a glass vessel. These reactors may be a valuable tool in the hands of an experienced chemist or reaction engineer:

* Microreactors typically have heat exchange coefficients of at least 1 megawatt per cubic meter per kelvin, up to 500 MW m−3 K−1 vs. a few kilowatts in conventional glassware (1 L flask ~10 kW m−3 K−1). Thus, microreactors can remove heat much more efficiently than vessels and even critical reactions such as nitrations can be performed safely at high temperatures. Hot spot temperatures as well as the duration of high temperature exposition due to exothermicity decreases remarkably. Thus, microreactors may allow better kinetic investigations, because local temperature gradients affecting reaction rates are much smaller than in any batch vessel. Heating and cooling a microreactor is also much quicker and operating temperatures can be as low as −100 °C. As a result of the superior heat transfer, reaction temperatures may be much higher than in conventional batch-reactors. Many low temperature reactions as organo-metal chemistry can be performed in microreactors at temperatures of −10 °C rather than −50 °C to −78 °C as in laboratory glassware equipment.
* Microreactors are normally operated continuously. This allows the subsequent processing of unstable intermediates and avoids typical batch workup delays. Especially low temperature chemistry with reaction times in the millisecond to second range are no longer stored for hours until dosing of reagents is finished and the next reaction step may be performed. This rapid work up avoids decay of precious intermediates and often allows better selectivities.
* Continuous operation and mixing causes a very different concentration profile when compared with a batch process. In a batch, reagent A is filled in and reagent B is slowly added. Thus, B encounters initially a high excess of A. In a microreactor, A and B are mixed nearly instantly and B won&#x27;t be exposed to a large excess of A. This may be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the reaction mechanism - it is important to be aware of such different concentration profiles.
* Although a bench-top microreactor can synthesize chemicals only in small quantities, scale-up to industrial volumes is simply a process of multiplying the number of microchannels. In contrast, batch processes too often perform well on R&amp;D bench-top level but fail at batch pilot plant level.
* Pressurisation of materials within microreactors (and associated components) is generally easier than with traditional batch reactors. This allows reactions to be increased in rate by raising the temperature beyond the boiling point of the solvent. This, although typical Arrhenius behaviour, is more easily facilitated in microreactors and should be considered a key advantage. Pressurisation may also allow dissolution of reactant gasses within the flow stream.

==Challenges==
* Although there have been reactors made for handling particles, microreactors generally do not tolerate particulates well, often clogging. Clogging has been identified by a number of researchers as the biggest hurdle for microreactors being widely accepted as a beneficial alternative to batch reactors. So far, the so-called microjetreactor is free of clogging by precipitating products. Gas evolved may also shorten the residence time of reagents as volume is not constant during the reaction. This may be prevented by application of pressure.
* Mechanical pumping may generate a pulsating flow which can be disadvantageous. Much work has been devoted to development of pumps with low pulsation. A continuous flow solution is electroosmotic flow (EOF).
* The logistics issue and enhanced pressure drop across microreactor limits its applicability in large-scale production units. However, clean solutions are handled well in microreactors.
* The scale-up of production rates and leakage are quite challenging in case of microreactor. Recently, so called nanoparticle immobilized reactors are developed to solve logistics and scale-up issues, associated with the microreactors. 
*Typically, reactions performing very well in a microreactor encounter many problems in vessels, especially when scaling up. Often, the high area to volume ratio and the uniform residence time cannot easily be scaled.
* Corrosion imposes a bigger issue in microreactors because area to volume ratio is high. Degradation of few μm may go unnoticed in conventional vessels. As typical inner dimensions of channels are in the same order of magnitude, characteristics may be altered significantly.

==T reactors==
One of the simplest forms of a microreactor is a &#x27;T&#x27; reactor. A &#x27;T&#x27; shape is etched into a plate with a depth that may be 40 micrometres and a width of 100 micrometres: the etched path is turned into a tube by sealing a flat plate over the top of the etched groove. The cover plate has three holes that align to the top-left, top-right, and bottom of the &#x27;T&#x27; so that fluids can be added and removed. A solution of reagent &#x27;A&#x27; is pumped into the top left of the &#x27;T&#x27; and solution &#x27;B&#x27; is pumped into the top right of the &#x27;T&#x27;. If the pumping rate is the same, the components meet at the top of the vertical part of the &#x27;T&#x27; and begin to mix and react as they go down the trunk of the &#x27;T&#x27;. A solution of product is removed at the base of the &#x27;T&#x27;.

==Applications==
===Synthesis===
Microreactors can be used to synthesise material more effectively than current batch techniques allow. The benefits here are primarily enabled by the mass transfer, thermodynamics, and high surface area to volume ratio environment as well as engineering advantages in handling unstable intermediates. Microreactors are applied in combination with photochemistry, electrosynthesis, multicomponent reactions and polymerization (for example that of butyl acrylate). It can involve liquid-liquid systems but also solid-liquid systems with for example the channel walls coated with a heterogeneous catalyst. Synthesis is also combined with online purification of the product. Following green chemistry principles, microreactors can be used to synthesize and purify extremely reactive Organometallic Compounds for ALD and CVD applications, with improved safety in operations and higher purity products.

In microreactor studies a Knoevenagel condensation was performed with the channel coated with a zeolite catalyst layer which also serves to remove water generated in the reaction. The same reaction was performed in a microreactor covered by polymer brushes.
A Suzuki reaction was examined in another study with a palladium catalyst confined in a polymer network of polyacrylamide and a triarylphosphine formed by interfacial polymerization:
:

The combustion of propane was demonstrated to occur at temperatures as low as 300 °C in a microchannel setup filled up with an aluminum oxide lattice coated with a platinum / molybdenum catalyst:

=== Enzyme catalyzed polymer synthesis ===
Enzymes immobilized on solid supports are increasingly used for greener, more sustainable chemical transformation processes. &gt; enabled to perform heterogeneous reactions in continuous mode, in organic media, and at elevated temperatures. Using microreactors, enabled faster polymerization and higher molecular mass compared to using batch reactors. It is evident that similar microreactor based platforms can readily be extended to other enzyme-based systems, for example, high-throughput screening of new enzymes and to precision measurements of new processes where continuous flow mode is preferred. This is the first reported demonstration of a solid supported enzyme-catalyzed polymerization reaction in continuous mode.

===Analysis===
Microreactors can also enable experiments to be performed at a far lower scale and far higher experimental rates than currently possible in batch production, while not collecting the physical experimental output. The benefits here are primarily derived from the low operating scale, and the integration of the required sensor technologies to allow high quality understanding of an experiment. The integration of the required synthesis, purification and analytical capabilities is impractical when operating outside of a microfluidic context.

====NMR====

Researchers at the Radboud University Nijmegen and Twente University, the Netherlands, have developed a microfluidic high-resolution NMR flow probe. They have shown a model reaction being followed in real-time. The combination of the uncompromised (sub-Hz) resolution and a low sample volume can prove to be a valuable tool for flow chemistry.

====Infrared spectroscopy====

Mettler Toledo and Bruker Optics offer dedicated equipment for monitoring, with attenuated total reflectance spectrometry (ATR spectrometry) in microreaction setups. The former has been demonstrated for reaction monitoring. The latter has been successfully used for reaction monitoring and determining dispersion characteristics of a microreactor.

==Academic research==
Microreactors, and more generally, micro process engineering, are the subject of worldwide academic research. A prominent recurring conference is IMRET, the International Conference on Microreaction Technology. Microreactors and micro process engineering have also been featured in dedicated sessions of other conferences, such as the Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), or the International Symposia on Chemical Reaction Engineering (ISCRE). Research is now also conducted at various academic institutions around the world, e.g. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon, at University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California in the United States, at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, at Eindhoven University of Technology in Eindhoven, at Radboud University Nijmegen in Nijmegen, Netherlands and at the LIPHT of Université de Strasbourg in Strasbourg and LGPC of the University of Lyon, CPE Lyon, France and at KU Leuven, Belgium.

==Market structure==
The market for microreactors can be segmented based on customer objectives, into turnkey, modular, and bespoke systems.

Turnkey (ready to run) systems are being used where the application environment stands to benefit from new chemical synthesis schemes, enhanced investigational throughput of up to approximately 10 - 100 experiments per day (depends on reaction time) and reaction subsystem, and actual synthesis conduct at scales ranging from 10 milligrams per experiment to triple digit tons per year (continuous operation of a reactor battery).

Modular (open) systems are serving the niche for investigations on continuous process engineering lay-outs, where a measurable process advantage over the use of standardized equipment is anticipated by chemical engineers. Multiple process lay-outs can be rapidly assembled and chemical process results obtained on a scale ranging from several grams per experiment up to approximately 100 kg at a moderate number of experiments per day (3-15). A secondary transfer of engineering findings in the context of a plant engineering exercise (scale-out) then provides target capacity of typically single product dedicated plants. This mimics the success of engineering contractors for the petro-chemical process industry.

With dedicated developments, manufacturers of microstructured components are mostly commercial development partners to scientists in search of novel synthesis technologies. Such development partners typically excel in the set-up of comprehensive investigation and supply schemes, to model a desired contacting pattern or spatial arrangement of matter. To do so they predominantly offer information from proprietary integrated modeling systems that combine computational fluid dynamics with thermokinetic modelling. Moreover, as a rule, such development partners establish the overall application analytics to the point where the critical initial hypothesis can be validated and further confined.

<doc id="729878" wikidata="Q7364551" url="?curid=729878" title="Ron Wilson (American politician)">
<text>Ronald Gene &quot;Ron&quot; Wilson (born 1943) is an American businessman convicted of his role in a $90 million Ponzi scheme in 2012. He was a member of the Anderson County Council from 2006 to 2010. Prior to this he served as the 68th Commander-in-Chief of the Sons of Confederate Veterans from 2002 to 2004.

==Sons of Confederate Veterans==
Wilson served as Commander-in-Chief of the Sons of Confederate Veterans from 2002 to 2004. During that time, he disparaged and limited the participation of those within the Sons of Confederate Veterans leadership that he and others termed &quot;moderates&quot;, and worked to more closely ally the group with secessionist advocates and white supremacists, including Kirk D. Lyons, Boyd Cathey, and others, and also with groups like the avowedly secessionist League of the South.

==Political career==
Wilson ran unsuccessfully in 2004 for a seat in the South Carolina Senate representing Anderson County. In 2006 was elected as the Republican member for District 6 in the Anderson County Council. Wilson also served on the South Carolina Board of Education.

==Investment scandal==
On November 13, 2012, Wilson was sentenced to almost 20 years in prison for operating a &quot;Ponzi Scheme&quot; from 2001 to 2012 that swindled investors of almost $90,000,000. In the scheme, he convinced retirees, friends, business associates, fellow members of the SCV and others to take cash from retirement accounts and insurance policies, as well as more liquid cash, and invest in his silver investment business, Atlantic Bullion &amp; Coin, Inc. He promised he would monitor &quot;key indicators&quot;, invest accordingly, and rake in large profits. He never bought silver for most of his clients, telling them that the silver was in a Delaware depository. (The depository had never heard of Wilson.) As with all Ponzi schemes, new invested money was instead used to pay earlier investors and keep the scheme alive. Besides time served, his sentence requires restitution of $57,401,009. A web site has been set up to assist victims of the Wilson scheme in making claims, as well as providing news and information. Several investors who received unearned profits were sued to retrieve the money. 

In 2014, Wilson received an additional six months on his prison sentence due to attempts to hide assets that involved his brother and ex-wife, as reported by Matthew Cox to the United States Secret Service.
In 2021, he was removed to a halfway house, then to home confinement. He will remain on probation until 2029.

On December 12th 2024, Wilson was commuted by President Joe Biden. Thus, ending his sentence on December 22nd 2024.

<text>Trade beads are beads that were used as a medium of barter within and amongst communities. They are considered to be one of the earliest forms of trade between members of the human race. It has also been surmised that bead trading was one of the reasons why humans developed language.

==Slave beads==

In sixteenth-century continental North America, trade beads (sometimes called aggry and slave beads) were decorative glass beads used as a token money to exchange for goods, services and slaves (hence the name). The beads were integrated in Native American jewelry using various beadwork techniques. Trade beads were also used by early Europeans to purchase African resources, including slaves in the African slave trade. Aggry beads are a particular type of decorated glass bead from Ghana. The practice continued until the early twentieth century.

==History==
Made to ease the passage of European explorers and then traders mainly across the African continent, the beads were made throughout Europe although the Venetians dominated production. Archaeologists documented in 2022 that beads manufactured in Europe continued to accompany exploration of Africa using Indigenous routes into the interior as recently as the late nineteenth century.

Trade beads are also found in the United States and Canada, and throughout Latin America. The bead designs were varied. North American Indians sought beads of particular color, size, and form. The frequency of archaeological discovery of each type indicates their popularity. Large blue beads were favoured early in the trade although details of when European trade with native American Indians began remains elusive.

It was reported in February 2022 that Venetian glass trade beads had been found at three prehistoric Eskimo sites in Alaska, including Punyik Point. Uninhabited today, and located a mile from the Continental Divide in the Brooks Range, the area was on ancient trade routes from the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean. From their creation in Venice, Italy, researchers believe the likely route these artifacts traveled was across Europe, then Eurasia and finally over the Bering Strait, making this discovery &quot;the first documented instance of the presence of indubitable European materials in prehistoric sites in the western hemisphere as the result of overland transport across the Eurasian continent.&quot; After radiocarbon dating materials found near the beads, archaeologists estimated their arrival on the continent to sometime between 1440 and 1480, predating Christopher Columbus. The dating and provenance has been challenged by other researchers who point out that such beads were not made in Venice until the mid-sixteenth century and that an early-seventeenth-century French origin is possible.

The production of slave (trade) beads became so popular that literally tons of these beads were used for this purpose. Beads were used as ballast in slave/trade ships for the outbound trip. The beads and other trade items were exchanged for human cargo as well as ivory, gold, and other goods desired in Europe and around the world. The beads traded were not of a set design, but were produced according to demand. Millefiori (thousand flower) beads from Venice, Italy were one of the most commonly traded beads, and are commonly known as &quot;African trade beads.&quot; They were produced by creating flowers or stripes from glass canes, that were then cut and moulded onto a core of solid color. Beads such as the kiffa beads of Mauritania are thought to have resulted from women creating powdered glass beads to mimic the appearance of millefiori beads.

The success of this form of currency can largely be attributed to the work required to produce them locally (i.e. scarcity) and salability across space. The ease of production of these beads using methods employed by European artisans enabled exploitation via a speculative attack on this West African monetary system. Glassmaking was not common in Africa. Africans often used beads for currency and wealth storage, and social status could be easily determined by the quality, quantity and style of jewellery worn. This created a high demand for trade beads in Africa.

<doc id="729896" wikidata="Q1667635" url="?curid=729896" title="International Risk Governance Center">
<text>The International Risk Governance Center (IRGC) is a neutral interdisciplinary center based at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland. IRGC develops risk governance strategies that focus on involving all key stakeholder groups, including citizens, governments, businesses and academia. It exists to improve the understanding, management and governance of emerging and systemic risks that may have significant adverse consequences for human health and the environment, the economy and society. Its mission includes &quot;developing concepts of risk governance, anticipating major risk issues and providing risk governance policy advice for key decision-makers.&quot;
==History==
IRGC began as a non-profit called the International Risk Governance Council in 2003, when academics from various countries proposed to the Swiss State Secretariat for Education and Research to create an international and independent body with the mission to develop and implement concepts and actions to improve the governance of risk. The Swiss Federal Assembly then created the International Risk Governance Council to bridge increasing gaps between science, technological development, decision-makers, and the public. It was formally founded in Geneva as a private foundation in June 2003.José Mariano Gago, the former Portuguese Minister for Science and Higher Education, was the first chairman of the Foundation Board followed by Donald J. Johnston and Granger M. Morgan. Wolfgang Kröger was the founding rector.

In July 2012, the council was granted special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). As of January 1, 2013, the International Risk Governance Council signed a formal collaboration agreement with EPFL and moved to Lausanne. The goal of this move was strengthened collaboration with academia, which allowed the council to expand its academic network and further develop its science-based approach. In July 2014, it became a member of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).

In 2016, the Council became the International Risk Governance Center (IRGC) at EPFL, where it continues to develop the original mission and activities.

==Activities==
IRGC&#x27;s work is rooted in the IRGC Risk Governance Framework, which was developed to provide guidance to organizations and society for identifying and managing risks in situations of complexity, uncertainty or ambiguity. IRGC develops risk governance concepts and has developed numerous frameworks, including on the governance of emerging and systemic risks. These frameworks are applied to a wide range of specific risk domains.

IRGC&#x27;s frameworks are used by numerous institutions and organizations, including the European Food Safety Authority, the Health Council of the Netherlands, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the OECD, and the European Commission.

At EPFL, IRGC is one of the centers that act at the interface between academic research and education, and business and policy. IRGC interacts with the EPFL community and contributes a risk governance approach to their activities.

In recent years, IRGC has focused increasingly on risks associated with emerging technologies. Currently, IRGC is active in the areas of nanotechnology, climate engineering, the low-carbon transition, space debris collision risk, deepfakes, and governance of digital technology.

Past areas of focus include biosecurity, precision medicine, synthetic biology, unconventional gas development, bioenergy, and critical infrastructure.

This results in an increased concentration of fructose. Intolerance to fructose was first identified and reported in 1956.

Similarity in symptoms means that patients with fructose malabsorption often fit the profile of those with irritable bowel syndrome.

Fructose malabsorption is not to be confused with hereditary fructose intolerance, a potentially fatal condition in which the liver enzymes that break up fructose are deficient. Hereditary fructose intolerance is quite rare, affecting up to 1 in 20,000 to 30,000 people.

==Symptoms and signs==
Fructose malabsorption may cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence or diarrhea.

== Pathophysiology ==
Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine without help of digestive enzymes. Even in healthy persons, however, only about 25–50 g of fructose per sitting can be properly absorbed. People with fructose malabsorption absorb less than 25 g per sitting. Simultaneous ingestion of fructose and sorbitol seems to increase malabsorption of fructose. Fructose that has not been adequately absorbed is fermented by intestinal bacteria producing hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and short-chain fatty acids. This abnormal increase in hydrogen may be detectable with the hydrogen breath test.

The physiological consequences of fructose malabsorption include increased osmotic load, rapid bacterial fermentation, altered gastrointestinal motility, the formation of mucosal biofilm and altered profile of bacteria. These effects are additive with other short-chain poorly absorbed carbohydrates such as sorbitol. The clinical significance of these events depends upon the response of the bowel to such changes. Some effects of fructose malabsorption are decreased tryptophan, folic acid and zinc in the blood.

Restricting dietary intake of free fructose and/or fructans may provide symptom relief in a high proportion of patients with functional gut disorders.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnostic test, when used, is similar to that used to diagnose lactose intolerance. It is called a hydrogen breath test and is the method currently used for a clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, some authors argue this test is not an appropriate diagnostic tool, because a negative result does not exclude a positive response to fructose restriction, implying a lack of sensitivity.

== Treatment ==

=== Physical activity (avoiding sitting down for long periods) ===
Sitting down can cause your abdomen to compress, which slows down digestion. This can lead to issues such as bloating, heartburn and constipation. It could thus increase or cause fructose malabsorption. A study shows that physical activity between long periods of sitting is not enough: &quot;focusing on acquiring the recommended dose of exercise is not strong enough of a stimulant to completely protect the body from physical inactivity the other 23+ h/day&quot;. &quot;Reducing prolonged overall sitting time may reduce metabolic disturbances&quot;

=== Dietary supplements ===
Xylose isomerase acts to convert fructose sugars into glucose. Dietary supplements of xylose isomerase may improve some symptoms of fructose malabsorption, although there is currently only a single scientific study available.

=== Diet ===
There is no known cure, but an appropriate diet and the enzyme xylose isomerase can help. The ingestion of glucose simultaneously with fructose improves fructose absorption and may prevent the development of symptoms. For example, people may tolerate fruits such as grapefruits or bananas, which contain similar amounts of fructose and glucose, but apples are not tolerated because they contain high levels of fructose and lower levels of glucose. But a randomised controlled trials in patients with fructose malabsorption (made by the Cochrane institute) found that &quot;Adding glucose to food and solutions to enhance fructose absorption is not effective in preventing fructose-induced functional gastrointestinal symptoms&quot;.

Foods that should be avoided by people with fructose malabsorption include:
* Foods and beverages containing greater than 0.5 g fructose in excess of glucose per 100 g and greater than 0.2 g of fructans per serving should be avoided. Foods with &gt;3 g of fructose per serving are termed a &#x27;high fructose load&#x27; and possibly present a risk of inducing symptoms. However, the concept of a &#x27;high fructose load&#x27; has not been evaluated in terms of its importance in the success of the diet.
* Foods with high fructose-to-glucose ratio. Glucose enhances absorption of fructose, so fructose from foods with fructose-to-glucose ratio &lt;1, like white potatoes, are readily absorbed, whereas foods with fructose-to-glucose ratio &gt;1, like apples and pears, are often problematic regardless of the total amount of fructose in the food.
* Foods rich in fructans and other fermentable oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), including artichokes, asparagus, leeks, onions, and wheat-containing products, including breads, cakes, biscuits, breakfast cereals, pies, pastas, pizzas, and wheat noodles.
:The role that fructans play in fructose malabsorption is still under investigation. However, it is recommended that fructan intake for fructose malabsorbers should be kept to less than 0.5 grams/serving, and supplements with &quot;inulin&quot; and &quot;fructooligosaccharide&quot; (FOS), both fructans, should be avoided.
* Foods containing artificial sweeteners like sorbitol (present in some diet drinks and foods and occurring naturally in some stone fruits), xylitol (present in some berries) and other polyols (sugar alcohols, such as erythritol, mannitol and other ingredients that end with -tol, commonly added as in commercial foods).
* Foods containing high fructose corn syrup.

Foods with a high glucose content ingested with foods containing excess fructose may help patients absorb the excess fructose.

==== Foods with high fructose content ====
According to the USDA database, foods with more fructose than glucose include:

The USDA food database reveals that many common fruits contain nearly equal amounts of the fructose and glucose, and they do not present problems for those individuals with fructose malabsorption. Some fruits with a greater ratio of fructose than glucose are apples, pears and watermelon, which contain more than twice as much fructose as glucose. Fructose levels in grapes varies depending on ripeness and variety, where unripe grapes contain more glucose.

=== Dietary guidelines for management ===
Researchers at Monash University in Australia developed dietary guidelines for managing fructose malabsorption, particularly for individuals with IBS.

==== Unfavorable foods (i.e. more fructose than glucose) ====
* Fruit – apple, pear, honeydew melon, nashi pear, pawpaw, papaya, quince, star fruit, watermelon;
* Dried fruit – apple, currant, date, fig, pear, raisin, sultana;
* Fortified wines
* Foods containing added sugars, such as agave nectar, some corn syrups, and fruit juice concentrates.

==== Favorable foods (i.e. fructose equal to or less than glucose) ====
The following list of favorable foods was cited in the paper: &quot;Fructose malabsorption and symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Guidelines for effective dietary management&quot;. The fructose and glucose contents of foods listed on the Australian food standards would appear to indicate that most of the listed foods have higher fructose levels.
* Stone fruit: apricot, nectarine, peach, plum (caution – these fruits contain sorbitol);
* Berry fruit: blackberry, boysenberry, cranberry, raspberry, strawberry, loganberry;
* Citrus fruit: kumquat, grapefruit, lemon, lime, mandarin, orange, tangelo;
* Other fruits: ripe banana, jackfruit, passion fruit, pineapple, rhubarb, tamarillo.

== Food-labeling ==
Producers of processed food in most or all countries, including the US, are not currently required by law to mark foods containing &quot;fructose in excess of glucose&quot;. This can cause some surprises and pitfalls for fructose malabsorbers.

Foods (such as bread) marked &quot;gluten-free&quot; are usually suitable for fructose malabsorbers, though they need to be careful of gluten-free foods that contain dried fruit or high fructose corn syrup or fructose itself in sugar form. However, fructose malabsorbers do &quot;not&quot; need to avoid gluten, as those with celiac disease must.

Many fructose malabsorbers can eat breads made from rye and corn flour. However, these may contain wheat unless marked &quot;wheat-free&quot; (or &quot;gluten-free&quot;) (Note: Rye bread is &quot;not&quot; gluten-free.) Although often assumed to be an acceptable alternative to wheat, spelt flour is not suitable for people with fructose malabsorption, just as it is not appropriate for those with wheat allergies or celiac disease. However, some fructose malabsorbers do not have difficulty with fructans from wheat products while they may have problems with foods that contain excess free fructose.

There are many breads on the market that boast having no high fructose corn syrup. In lieu of high fructose corn syrup, however, one may find the production of special breads with a high inulin content, where inulin is a replacement in the baking process for the following: high fructose corn syrup, flour and fat. Because of the caloric reduction, lower fat content, dramatic fiber increase and prebiotic tendencies of the replacement inulin, these breads are considered a healthier alternative to traditionally prepared leavening breads. Though the touted health benefits may exist, people with fructose malabsorption will likely find no difference between these new breads and traditionally prepared breads in alleviating their symptoms because inulin is a fructan, and, again, consumption of fructans should be reduced dramatically in those with fructose malabsorption in an effort to appease symptoms.

== Research ==
Fructose and fructans are FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di- and mono-saccharides and polyols) known to cause gastrointestinal discomfort in susceptible individuals. FODMAPs are not the cause of these disorders, but FODMAPs restriction (a low-FODMAP diet) might help to improve short-term digestive symptoms in adults with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). Nevertheless, its long-term follow-up can have negative effects because it causes a detrimental impact on the gut microbiota and metabolome.

<text>Laurence Hugh Frost (July 22, 1902 – May 23, 1977) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy who served as Director of Naval Intelligence and Director of the National Security Agency.

==Naval career==
Frost graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1926, and served on various ships and shore stations throughout the 1920s and 1930s. He was the commanding officer of when that destroyer was attacked by a German U-boat on 4 September 1941. This was the first attack by Germany on a United States warship during World War II and occurred while the United States was officially neutral, some three months before America entered the war.

After decorated service in World War II, Frost was assigned to Naval Intelligence and later saw combat as commander of the cruiser in the Korean War. He was chief of staff to Commander First Fleet in 1952. He commanded Destroyer Flotilla Four, United States Atlantic Fleet in 1955–1956 and was Director of Naval Intelligence from 1956 until 1960. As head of Naval Intelligence he tried to change the United States policy on the rebellion in Indonesia.

Frost became director of the National Security Agency (NSA) in November 1960 with the rank of vice admiral. He held this post until 1962. Holding these posts during the beginning of the space race, Frost was involved in early decisions to promote surveillance satellites such as the navy&#x27;s ELINT program.

In an effort to reduce tensions, soon after his arrival at NSA, Frost appointed Robert F. Rinehart as chairman of the National Security Agency Scientific Advisory Board specifically because he was the newest member of the board with only a few months&#x27; experience and so had fewer &quot;pre-acquired biases&quot; in Rinehart&#x27;s words. According to the NSA, &quot;In 1962, when Vice Admiral Laurence Frost was unexpectedly transferred from his position&quot; Gordon Blake was his replacement.

After a final tour of duty at the Potomac River Naval Command, Frost retired in 1964. His papers are preserved at the Operational Archives Branch of the Naval Historical Center in Washington, D.C. He is listed as a rear admiral by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, which holds an 11-page transcription of an oral interview he gave in 1970. portions of it remain &quot;closed&quot;.

During his career, Frost was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star with one gold award star, and the Legion of Merit with one gold award star and a Combat &quot;V&quot;.

<text>The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, more commonly known simply as the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), is a special district responsible for public transit services, congestion management, specific highway improvement projects, and countywide transportation planning for Santa Clara County, California. It serves San Jose, California, and the surrounding Silicon Valley. It is one of the governing parties for the Caltrain commuter rail line that serves the county. In , the VTA&#x27;s public transportation services had a combined ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==
=== Santa Clara County Transit District ===
In 1969, Santa Clara County had three private bus companies, all of which were in serious financial trouble: Peninsula Transit, San Jose City Lines, and Peerless Stages. The California Legislature enacted the Santa Clara County Transit District Act in 1969, which allowed the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors to place a ballot measure asking county voters if the Santa Clara County Transit District (SCCTD) should be formed. However, the Act did not supply any funding from the state level for the new district; SCCTD would be funded as required by issuing bonds. At the time, county voters were reluctant to raise their own taxes to support a local public transit system. The formation of the Santa Clara County Transit District was rejected in 1969 and 1970 before it was finally approved by county voters on June 6, 1972. The SCCTD took over the operations of the three old bus companies on January 1, 1973.

On September 26, 1974, the county Board of Supervisors dissolved the Public Works Department. Non-transit operations went into a new General Services Agency, while transit operations were placed into a new Santa Clara County Transportation Agency. Under the terms of the SCCTD Act, the five-member Board of Supervisors also served as the Board of Supervisors for the new transit district. They would be advised by a commission consisting of members appointed by the cities (one member appointed by each city in the county) and five members of the public appointed by the county supervisors. SCCTD administration would be led by an executive officer.

In its early years the Santa Clara County Transportation District approached the task of replacing the bus fleet it inherited from its predecessors, which was in need of upgrades and repair. At first the district bought propane-fueled Twin Coaches and Gillig/Neoplans. SCCTD switched to an all-diesel fleet after six buses went up in flames between December 1977 and April 1978. At the time, critics referred to the buses as &quot;rolling propane bombs.&quot;

On March 6, 1976, Santa Clara County voters approved a half-cent sales tax, Measure A, to help support the Santa Clara County Transit District. In 1977, the primary Overhaul and Repair Facility was built at the Cerone Yard. Also in 1977, County Supervisors decided to change the bus fleet from propane to diesel and ordered 102 buses. By 1979, three additional bus yards were built and commissioned into service.

In December 1978, the SCCTD approved an affirmative action plan for the Transportation Agency to improve the diversity of its workforce. On March 25, 1987, after a long legal battle, the U.S. Supreme Court by a 6-3 majority upheld the gender component of the plan against a civil rights challenge in &quot;Johnson v. Transportation Agency&quot;.

The transit district broke ground on a new light rail system in 1986. It commenced revenue service along the Guadalupe line on December 11, 1987. With the introduction of light rail service, the transit district replaced its traditional blue and orange color scheme with blue and burgundy across the system, to better match the Tuscan red on the new light rail stations. Expansion of the single line continued in sections until 1991 when the starter system was completed to Santa Teresa station in South San Jose including the Almaden spur line.

=== Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority ===
On January 1, 1995, the SCCTD merged with the county Congestion Management Agency to become the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (SCVTA). In December 1996, the agency adopted a shorter trade name, Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), as well as a new logo.

In 1996, voters approved a half-cent general county sales tax, Measure B, and a companion list of transportation projects recommended to be funded with Measure B, called (1996) Measure A. The two measures were designed to adhere to the rule in the California State Constitution that requires a two-thirds supermajority to pass any special purpose sales tax, but only a majority vote to pass a general sales tax. The measure was challenged, but in 1998, the California Supreme Court ruled that the two measure system was valid. The tax was to be collected for ten years.

In 2000, voters approved a 30-year extension of the 1996 sales tax to fund the Silicon Valley BART extension, which will eventually extend Bay Area Rapid Transit from its original terminus in Fremont to Santa Clara Transit Center. 2000 Measure A also included funding for light rail extensions, bus service expansion, expansion and electrification of Caltrain service, and connections from San Jose International Airport to BART, Caltrain and VTA light rail. The measure was placed on the ballot by the VTA and did not include funding specifically for highway projects. The measure passed with 70% of the vote. Revenues from the sales tax would not begin being collected until April 2006.

After 2000, due to the dot-com bust, existing revenue sources declined and VTA was forced to cut service and increase fares. VTA introduced a series of fare increases between 1998 and 2005. VTA&#x27;s farebox recovery is approximately 13% and the Authority is focused on increasing the ratio. VTA contemplated service reductions in 2003 to address its budget problems. Instead, VTA changed routes to respond to customer demands and by 2008 saw increased ridership numbers.

In keeping with 2000 Measure A, VTA needed additional funding to deliver the second phase of the BART Silicon Valley extension to Santa Clara, including the subway tunnel through downtown San Jose. Measure B, added to the November 2016 ballot, would raise $6.3 billion for transit projects via a half-cent increase in sales tax. It included up to $1.6 billion for the BART extension, as well as funds for Caltrain electrification, grade separation, and road improvements. Voters passed the 2016 Measure B, which required a two-thirds majority vote. A lawsuit was filed in January 2017 by Cheriel Jensen to challenge the validity of the measure. It was initially dismissed with prejudice in July 2017, but an appeal was subsequently filed in August 2017 to the 6th District Court of Appeal. Pending a resolution, the funds collected by taxes introduced by 2016 Measure B were held in an escrow account. The appeals court upheld the dismissal, and on January 23, 2019, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the final appeal. In January 2020, climate activists pushed the VTA to reallocate Measure B funds away from road projects and into more transit improvements, but were voted down at the San Jose City Council, which controls a majority of the VTA&#x27;s board.

On June 13, 2020, VTA opened the first phase of the BART Silicon Valley extension to the Berryessa/North San José station, ceding operations to the Bay Area Rapid Transit District.

In April 2021, the VTA suffered a ransomware attack that disabled many of the agency&#x27;s computer systems, including the paratransit reservation tracker.

On May 26, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a VTA rail yard in San Jose, California. Ten people, including the gunman, were killed during the shooting, making it the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the San Francisco Bay Area.

== Leadership ==
===Board of directors===
Starting from January 1, 1995, the Santa Clara VTA special district is governed by a board of directors with 12 voting members composed of political leaders at the city and county level, including the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, San Jose City Council, and other cities including Campbell, Cupertino, Fremont, Gilroy, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, San Martin, Saratoga, and Sunnyvale.

Of the eighteen members, fifteen are drawn from city councils and three are county supervisors; twelve are voting members and six are alternates. Five of the fifteen board members from city councils are from San Jose, which has led to criticism that the board is too heavily weighted towards one city.

Under the original proposal to form VTA in 1994, a sixteen-member board was proposed: five members directly elected, one each from the five County Supervisorial Districts; and eleven appointed from elected bodies (city councils or the county board of supervisors). The implementing legislation changed this structure to a nineteen-member board: twelve voting members, five alternates, and up to two ex-officio members, who serve as VTA&#x27;s representatives to the Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission. For the first ten years (1995–2004), the twelve voting members were selected as:
* 5 from the San Jose City Council
* 5 from other city councils in Santa Clara County:
** 1 from Sunnyvale for 8 of 10 years; the remaining 2 years are filled by a member from the other Central district cities (Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Mountain View, or Palo Alto)
** 1 from Santa Clara for 8 of 10 years; the remaining 2 years are filled by a member from the other Central district cities
** 1 from the Central district cities, on a rotating basis
** 1 from the South/Eastern district cities (Gilroy, Milpitas, Morgan Hill or San Martin), on a rotating basis
** 1 from the Western district cities (Campbell, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, or Saratoga), on a rotating basis
* 2 County Supervisors

Each Board of Directors member serves a two-year term. For the non-rotating members (San Jose, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, and County Supervisor), each member may serve multiple terms.

From 2004 to 2009, the Board had similar requirements with five San Jose City Councilmembers and two County Supervisors; the five non-San Jose city-level Board members were selected as:
:* 1 from the South/Eastern district cities (Gilroy, Milpitas, Morgan Hill or San Martin), on a rotating basis
:* 1 from the Western district cities (Campbell, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, or Saratoga), on a rotating basis
:* 3 from the Central district cities (Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Mountain View, or Palo Alto), on a rotating basis

In June 2004, a Santa Clara County Grand Jury criticized the governance structure, calling it &quot;too large, too political, too dependent on staff, too inexperienced in some cases, and too removed from the financial and operational performance of VTA.&quot; Since VTA board members are required to be elected officials, they must juggle their other duties in addition to VTA. The Grand Jury recommended that the VTA board be shrunk to five to seven members, with members either appointed solely for transportation issues or directly elected by the voters. Grand juries in 2009 and 2019 have echoed similar complaints.

Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) introduced AB 1091 on February 18, 2021, which would reduce the size of the board to nine members, of which five would be appointed by the County Supervisors, two would be from San Jose, and two would be from the remaining cities, split between the northern cities (one member from Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Sunnyvale, or Milpitas) and the southern cities (one member from Santa Clara, Campbell, Cupertino, Saratoga, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill, San Martin or Gilroy). Instead of the current structure, which appoints Board members from elected officials, under Berman&#x27;s proposed bill, the Board members would be appointed from the public and serve four-year terms. AB 1091 faced significant opposition from the San Jose City Council and was tabled in May.

Berman followed up by re-introducing the VTA Board reform bill as AB 2181 on February 15, 2022. AB 2181 passed the Assembly on a 69–2 vote in May, with Assemblymembers Ash Kalra and Mark Stone opposed. Current and former VTA Board members criticized AB 2181 as not sufficiently ensuring representation from smaller cities and not addressing the root causes of VTA&#x27;s low ridership.

===General Manager and CEO===

Operations and management at VTA are led by the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO). General Counsel Evelynn Tran served as the interim GM/CEO while the agency searched for a permanent replacement for Nuria I. Fernandez, who was appointed Deputy Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration in January 2021. Carolyn Gonot, who had served in multiple leadership roles at VTA before leaving in 2019 to head the Utah Transit Authority, was appointed the General Manager and CEO in May 2021, and began serving in July.

== Congestion management ==
VTA also serves as the Congestion Management Agency for Santa Clara County. In this role VTA makes decisions on what local projects can utilize federal and state funding, and manage sales tax revenue that is specified for VTA usages, such as 1987 Measure A and 2000 Measure A sales tax measures.

== Transit services ==
VTA operates three light rail lines, a number of bus lines, and paratransit service. VTA is a member agency of Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board that manages Caltrain commuter rail, providing one-third of annual operating funds and all the funding for specific improvement projects within Santa Clara County. VTA is also a member agency of Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority that manages Capitol Corridor intercity rail service. The VTA is responsible for building the Silicon Valley BART extension but is not a member of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District.

As VTA covers Santa Clara County in general, it serves the major core city of San Jose (where VTA is based and headquartered), with service to the other municipalities of Campbell, Cupertino, Fremont, Gilroy, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, San Martin, Saratoga and Sunnyvale. Only Campbell, Milpitas, Mountain View, San Jose, Santa Clara and Sunnyvale are served by light rail. The VTA partners with Highway 17 Express to provide service to Santa Cruz and with Dumbarton Express to provide transbay service between Union City and Stanford University.

=== Light rail ===

=== Bus routes ===
VTA operates 43 regularly operating bus routes , including 39 regular bus routes and 4 rapid bus routes. Many of these routes connect to VTA light rail service, and Caltrain stations. In addition, VTA operates 4 express routes, 8 school trip services, 8 free shuttle routes connecting to ACE commuter rail services, and one commuter shuttle to the Valley Medical Center

VTA&#x27;s longest and most-used bus route is the 22, which connects VTA&#x27;s Eastridge Transit Center in East San Jose with the Caltrain station in Palo Alto, which serves as a transfer point for SamTrans buses from San Mateo County. Line 22, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, was the only line with 24-hour, 7 days-per-week service, including night bus service as part of the regional All-Nighter Network. Line 22&#x27;s fleet of coaches primarily consists of articulated low floorbuses.

On January 14, 2008, VTA implemented major updates in its bus service. Some routes became part of a community bus network that utilizes shorter buses and charges a cheaper fee than standard bus service. Others became part of a core network with headways of 15 minutes or less. Additionally, some bus routes underwent changes in routing, while other, less-used routes were deleted completely. The agency completed another bus service redesign on December 28, 2019.

=== BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) ===

==== Current service ====
On July 5, 2005, VTA implemented its first rapid bus line along the VTA&#x27;s busiest corridor. Modeled after the Metro Rapid service in Los Angeles, rapid bus Line 522 follows most of the Line 22 route, and features limited stops, headway based schedules, low floor fleet, and signal priority along El Camino Real. However, the current rapid bus service by VTA does not fully qualify as BRT, due to the lack of separate ticketing stations and platforms, distinctive vehicles, and special lanes which allow BRT to avoid traffic jams. Rather, it serves as a temporary rapid bus service until VTA officially opens a BRT transit corridor along the same route, which will upgrade the current 522 route.

==== Future ====

VTA had planned to add distinctive vehicles, separate bus-exclusive lanes on Alum Rock Avenue, El Camino Real, and Stevens Creek Boulevard, ticketing platforms separate from other buses, and possible amenities such as wait time for successive BRT buses by 2016 (making BRT behave more like a light rail or tram system, instead of bus service). This would also upgrade the existing 522 bus service to an official BRT, and rename the entire VTA-operated BRT service to VTA Rapid, differentiating it from VTA&#x27;s buses division.

This plan involved reducing general traffic lanes from 3 lanes in each direction which was unpopular and the plans were abandoned in January 2018.

An additional rapid line, the 568, along the current route 68 is proposed to replace the current 168 express as part of the 2021 Service Plan. This plan was delayed until February 2022 to direct resources to reducing passenger pass-ups due to capacity limits during the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Paratransit ===
VTA Access is the agency&#x27;s paratransit service, a door-to-door shuttle service available to disabled people that meets the requirements of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. MV Transportation, a for-profit agency, has been the contract paratransit broker for VTA since November 2016, after the previous broker, Outreach &amp; Escort, was found to be overbilling the agency for its VTA Outreach service.

=== Future SJC–Diridon–DAC connector ===
VTA released a request for information in July 2019 to solicit concepts for a grade-separated system that would connect Diridon Station with the San Jose International Airport (SJC), a distance of approximately . Potential SJC airport connector alignments include either an underground route following existing streets, or an aerial route partially along State Route 87. The RFI also asked potential bidders to design a continuation to De Anza College along Stevens Creek Boulevard. One major goal of the RFI was to determine if new technologies could be used to deliver a solution &quot;at significantly lower costs than traditional transit projects.&quot;

=== Holly Trolley ===

Sometimes, in the winter, VTA operates a seasonal vintage trolley service called the Holly Trolley. This trolley, a joint project of the VTA and the California Trolley and Railroad Corporation, began operations in December 2012. As of December 2019, it operates between Civic Center and Convention Center stations, although it operated to San Jose Diridon station until 2018.

==Facilities==

The VTA headquarters and administration offices are next to the River Oaks light rail station on North First Street in San Jose. There are four yards, three of which (Cerone, Chaboya, and North) are used for bus storage, with maintenance conducted at Cerone; the other (Guadalupe Yard) is the maintenance and storage facility for the light rail division.

== Highway improvement ==
Besides providing transit services to residents of Santa Clara County, VTA also manages countywide highway projects that use county sales tax revenues, in conjunction with Caltrans. In this role, VTA was responsible for several highway projects such as widening portions of US 101 between San Jose and Morgan Hill, and Interstate 880 within Santa Clara County. VTA will also be the leading agency in SR 152/SR 156 interchange and future widening projects.

<text>Charles Anthony Fry (14 January 1940 – 27 October 2024) was an English first-class cricketer and cricket administrator.

==Life and career==
The son of the cricketer Stephen Fry and the grandson of the sportsman C. B. Fry, Charles Fry was born in January 1940 at Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire. He was educated at Repton School, before matriculating to Trinity College, Oxford.

While studying at Oxford, Fry played first-class cricket for Oxford University Cricket Club, making his debut for the club against Yorkshire at Oxford in 1959. He scored 576 runs at an average of 26.18 in debut season, including a maiden century against the Free Foresters, sharing an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 256 with Abbas Ali Baig which remained a first-class record for the fifth wicket for Oxford until 2017, when it was broken by Dan Escott&#x27;s and Matthew Naylor&#x27;s partnership of 267. He gained his blue in this season, when he played against Cambridge University in The University Match at Lord&#x27;s. The Oxford side of 1959 was considered the last great Oxford University side, with E. W. Swanton proffering that it was good enough to finish in the top half of the County Championship.

The following season, Fry made fifteen first-class appearances for Oxford in 1960 and made his second appearance in The University Match, which gained him his second blue. In his season, he scored 642 runs for Oxford and made his second century. Later in the season, he made five first-class appearances for Hampshire in the County Championship, scoring 134 runs with a highest score of 38. Against Sussex at Bournemouth, he was notably bowled by Robin Marlar, who would later become one of his successors to the presidency of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He followed in the footsteps of both his father and grandfather, C. B. Fry in playing for Hampshire. As of , this remains the only instance of three generations of one family playing for the county. Fry did not, however, feature for Hampshire in their County Championship winning campaign the following season.

Fry played his third and final season for Oxford University in 1961, making twelve appearances and scoring 358 runs at an average of 18.84; his highest score in this season was 61. In his final year, he made his third appearance in The University Match and thus, gained his third blue. 41 of his 50 first-class appearances came for Oxford, with him scoring 1,576 runs for the university at an average of 24.24. The following season, having graduated from Oxford, he appeared twice for Northamptonshire against Cambridge University at Northampton, and Essex in the County Championship at Colchester. He later appeared twice for the Free Foresters in first-class cricket, against Oxford University in 1964 and 1968.

Fry had a long association with the MCC, succeeding Sir Tim Rice as its president in 2003. His tenure was not without controversy, with critics in the MCC claiming he ran club affairs akin to a dictator. At the end of his twelve-month presidency, he was succeeded by Tom Graveney, who was the first former professional cricketer to hold the post. In addition to holding the presidency, Fry was chairman of both the MCC and the MCC Foundation.

Fry worked in the financial sector, inventing and launching many products as an investment entrepreneur. He launched Johnson Fry, a mortgage and life insurance broker, in 1969. When he was forced out as chief executive, he started Pinder Fry &amp; Benjamin, a firm of financial advisers, eventually retiring in 2005. He died from complications of Parkinson’s disease at home in London, on 27 October 2024, at the age of 84.

<text>Christopher Fry (18 December 1907 – 30 June 2005) was an English poet and playwright. He is best known for his verse dramas, especially &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not for Burning&quot;, which made him a major force in theatre in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Fry was born as Arthur Hammond Harris in Bristol, the son of Charles John Harris, a master builder who retired early to work full-time as a licensed Lay Reader in the Church of England, and his wife Emma Marguerite Fry Hammond Harris. While still young, he took his mother&#x27;s maiden name because, on very tenuous grounds, he believed her to be related to the 19th-century Quaker prison reformer Elizabeth Fry. He adopted Elizabeth Fry&#x27;s faith, and became a Quaker.

After attending Bedford Modern School, where he wrote amateur plays, he became a schoolteacher, working at the Bedford Froebel Kindergarten and Hazelwood School in Limpsfield, Surrey.

In the 1920s, he met the writer Robert Gittings, who became a lifelong friend.

===Career===
Fry gave up his school career in 1932 to found the Tunbridge Wells Repertory Players, which he ran for three years, directing and starring in the English premiere of George Bernard Shaw’s &quot;A Village Wooing&quot; in 1934. As a curtain-raiser, he put on a revised version of a show he wrote when he was a schoolboy called &quot;The Peregrines&quot;. He also wrote the music for &quot;She Shall Have Music&quot; in 1935.

His play about Dr. Thomas John Barnardo, the founder of children&#x27;s homes, toured in a fund-raising amateur production in 1935 and 1936, including Deborah Kerr in its cast.

His professional career began to take off when he was commissioned by the vicar of Steyning, West Sussex, to write a play celebrating the local saint, Cuthman of Steyning, which became &quot;The Boy With A Cart&quot; in 1938. It would be put on professionally in 1950 with the young Richard Burton in his first starring role.

Tewkesbury Abbey commissioned his next play, &quot;The Tower&quot;, written in 1939, which was seen by the poet T. S. Eliot, who became a friend and is often cited as an influence. In 1939 Fry also became artistic director of Oxford Playhouse.

A pacifist, he was a conscientious objector during World War II, and served in the Non-Combatant Corps; for part of the time he cleaned London&#x27;s sewers.

After the War, he wrote a comedy, &quot;A Phoenix Too Frequent&quot;, which was produced at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate, and revived at the Arts Theatre London, in 1946, starring Paul Scofield, Hermione Hannen, and Joan White. The show is a comedy that is based upon Petronius&#x27;s tale of the Ephesian widow, the false heroics of Dynamene&#x27;s mourning of her husband in his tomb, and her reawakening to the joy of life by a handsome officer who enters the tomb to rest on a course of duty.

&quot;The Firstborn&quot; was produced at the Oxford Playhouse in 1948. The plot is that of Egypt in the throes of a threatening conflict between master and slave, with Moses denouncing his privileges as an Egyptian-reared soldier and finding new responsibility as a leader of his people. The play was produced by actress Katharine Cornell and featured two songs specially written for the play by Leonard Bernstein.

In 1948 he wrote a commission for the Canterbury Festival, &quot;Thor, With Angels&quot;.

===Major works===
Fry was then commissioned to write a play by Alec Clunes, manager of the Arts Theatre in London. The result, &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not for Burning&quot;, was first performed there in 1948, directed by the actor Jack Hawkins. Due to its success, it transferred to the West End for a nine-month run, starring John Gielgud and featuring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom among the cast. It was presented on Broadway in 1950, again with Burton. The play marked a revival in popularity for poetic drama, most notably espoused by T.S. Eliot. It is the most performed of all his plays and inspired British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to declaim, &quot;You turn if you want to — the lady’s not for turning,&quot; at the Conservative Party conference in 1980.

In 1950, Fry adapted a translation of Jean Anouilh’s &quot;Invitation to the Castle&quot; as &quot;Ring Round the Moon&quot; for director Peter Brook. He also wrote &quot;Venus Observed&quot;, which was produced at the St James&#x27;s Theatre by Laurence Olivier. &quot;A Sleep of Prisoners&quot; followed in 1951, first performed at St Thomas&#x27; church in Regent Street, London, in 1951 and later touring with Denholm Elliott and Stanley Baker.

&quot;The Dark is Light Enough&quot;, a winter play starring Katharine Cornell and Edith Evans in 1954, was third in a quartet of &quot;seasonal&quot; plays, featured incidental music written by Leonard Bernstein. The production also featured Tyrone Power, Lorne Greene and Marian Winters. Christopher Plummer had an understudy role that he wrote about in his memoir. This play followed the springtime of &quot;The Lady’s Not For Burning&quot; and the autumnal &quot;Venus Observed&quot;. The quartet was completed in 1970 with &quot;A Yard Of Sun&quot;, representing summer.

His next plays were translations from French dramatists: &quot;The Lark&quot;, an adaptation of Jean Anouilh’s &quot;L&#x27;Alouette&quot; (&quot;The Lark&quot;), in 1955; &quot;Tiger At The Gates&quot;, based on Jean Giraudoux’s &quot;La guerre de Troie n&#x27;aura pas lieu&quot;, also in 1955; &quot;Duel of Angels&quot;, adapted from Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;Pour Lucrèce&quot;, in 1960; and &quot;Judith&quot;, also by Giraudoux, in 1962.

Although Fry lived until 2005, his poetic style of drama began to fall out of fashion with the advent of the Angry Young Men of British theatre in the mid-1950s. Despite working mainly for the cinema in the 1960s, he continued to write plays, including &quot;Curtmantle&quot; for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962, and &quot;A Yard of Sun&quot; – the fourth in his seasonal quartet – at the Nottingham Playhouse in 1970.

&quot;Curtmantle&quot;″s (1962) plot deals with Henry II of England and his conflict with Thomas Becket. &quot;A Yard of Sun&quot; (1970) is set just after World War II at the time of the famous annual horse race Palio di Siena in the streets of Siena.

After the success of his post-war plays Fry bought Trebinshwn, a fine Regency house in Breconshire. When living there he used to walk over the hill behind the house, the Allt, to Llansantffraed church, where the 17th-century poet Henry Vaughan is buried, and Vaughan&#x27;s poetry was a strong influence on him.

During the next ten years, he concentrated on further translations, including Henrik Ibsen’s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; and Edmond Rostand’s &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; which were produced at the Chichester Festival Theatre.

In 1986, he wrote &quot;One Thing More&quot;, a play about the 7th century Northumbrian monk Cædmon who was suddenly given the gift of composing song; The play was first broadcast on BBC radio, 
and then performed by the Next Stage Company directed by Joan White at Chelsea Old Church, November 1988, and at Whitby Abbey in Yorkshire, June 1989. Further productions followed in London and Oxford.

His last play, &quot;A Ringing Of Bells&quot;, was commissioned by his old school, Bedford Modern School, and performed there in 2000. The following year, a new production was performed at the National Theatre.

In later life Fry lived in the village of East Dean in West Sussex, and died, from natural causes, in Chichester in 2005. His wife, Phyllis, whom he married in 1936, died in 1987. He was survived by their son, Tam.

===Revivals===
Revivals of his plays include a staged reading of &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not For Burning&quot; at the National Theatre in 2001 as one of the 100 best plays of the 20th century, with actors Alex Jennings, Prunella Scales and Samuel West. West went on to produce &quot;The Lady’s Not For Burning&quot; at Chichester Festival Theatre&#x27;s Minerva Theatre in 2002 with Nancy Carroll and Benjamin Whitrow. In 2007, it was performed in a new production at the Finborough Theatre, London.

&quot;Ring Round The Moon&quot; was revived at the Theatre Royal Haymarket 1967-68. starring John Standing and Angela Thorne. In 2008, it was revived again, directed by Sean Mathias, once again starring Angela Thorne, graduating from the role of young Diana to the wheelchair-using Madame Desmortes. Other cast members included JJ Feild, Joanna David, Belinda Lang, John Ramm and Leigh Lawson.

===Legacy===
In commemoration of his achievements, Bedford Modern School named the new Junior School hall after him.

===Film and TV writing===
Beginning in the 1950s, many of Fry&#x27;s plays were adapted for the screen, mainly television. A version of &quot;The Lady’s Not For Burning&quot; was produced by Yorkshire Television, starring Kenneth Branagh, in 1987.

Fry collaborated with Denis Cannan on a screenplay for the film version of John Gay’s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (1953), for director Peter Brook, starring Laurence Olivier. He was also one of the writers of the film, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), directed by William Wyler. But he was uncredited for his efforts on &quot;Ben Hur&quot;, as was Gore Vidal. The sole writing credit and Academy Award nomination instead went to Karl Tunberg. He collaborated on other screenplays including &quot;Barabbas&quot; (1961), which starred Anthony Quinn, and &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning&quot; (1966), directed by John Huston. Other screenplays include the documentary &quot;The Queen Is Crowned&quot; (1953).

His television movie scripts are &quot;The Canary&quot; (1950), &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (1968), &quot;The Brontës of Haworth&quot; (1973), &quot;The Best of Enemies&quot; (1976), &quot;Sister Dora&quot; (1977), and &quot;Star Over Bethlehem&quot; (1981).

<text>Aurelius Prudentius Clemens () was a Roman Christian poet, born in the Roman province of Tarraconensis (now Northern Spain) in 348. He probably died in the Iberian Peninsula some time after 405, possibly around 413. The place of his birth is uncertain, but it may have been Caesaraugusta (Saragossa), Tarraco (Tarragona), or Calagurris (Calahorra).

==Life==
Prudentius practiced law with some success, and was twice provincial governor, perhaps in his native country, before the emperor Theodosius I summoned him to court. Towards the end of his life (possibly around 392) Prudentius retired from public life to become an ascetic, fasting until evening and abstaining entirely from animal food; and writing poems, hymns, and controversial works in defence of Christianity. Prudentius later collected the Christian poems written during this period and added a preface, which he himself dated 405.

==Poetry==
The poetry of Prudentius is influenced by early Christian authors, such as Tertullian and St. Ambrose, as well as the Bible and the acts of the martyrs. His hymn &quot;Da, puer, plectrum&quot; (including &quot;Corde natus ex parentis&quot;: &quot;Of the Father&#x27;s Love Begotten&quot;) and the hymn for Epiphany &quot;O sola magnarum urbium&quot; (&quot;Earth Has Many A Noble City&quot;), both from the &quot;Cathemerinon&quot;, are still in use today.

The allegorical &quot;Psychomachia&quot;, however, is his most influential work, incorporating as it did elements of both Hellenic epic and inner psychological conflict. It became the inspiration and wellspring of medieval allegorical literature, its influence (according to C. S. Lewis) exceeding its intrinsic artistic merit. In the battle between virtue and vice, full weight is given to the power of Luxuria, “Flowershod and swaying from the wine cup, Every step a fragrance”. With her attendants Beauty and Pleasure, and her weapons of rose-petals and violets, she succeeds in swaying the army of Virtue “in surrender to love”, before succumbing to ultimate defeat.

==Influence==
With his merger of Christianity with classical culture, Prudentius was one of the most popular medieval authors, being aligned as late as the 13th century alongside such figures as Horace and Statius in Henri d&#x27;Andeli&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Seven Arts&quot; between Grammar (poetry) and Logic.

==Works==
The list of Prudentius&#x27;s works given in the preface to his autobiography mentions the hymns, poems against the Priscillianists and against Symmachus and Peristephanon. The Diptychon is not mentioned. The twelve hymns of the Cathemerinon liber (&quot;Daily Round&quot;) consist of six for daily use, five for festivals, and one intended for every hour of the day.

The specific works include:

* &quot;Liber Cathemerinon&quot; -- (&quot;Book in Accordance with the Hours&quot;) comprises 12 lyric poems on various times of the day and on church festivals.
* &quot;Liber Peristephanon&quot; -- (&quot;Crowns of Martyrdom&quot;) contains 14 lyric poems on Spanish and Roman martyrs. Some were suggested to Prudentius by sacred images in churches or by the inscriptions of Pope Damasus I.
* &quot;Apotheosis&quot; -- (&quot;Deification&quot;) attacks disclaimers of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus.
* &quot;Hamartigenia&quot; -- (&quot;The Origin of Sin&quot;) attacks the Gnostic dualism of Marcion and his followers. In this and the &quot;Apotheosis&quot;, Tertullian is the source of inspiration.
* &quot;Psychomachia&quot; -- (&quot;Battle of Souls&quot;) describes the struggle of faith, supported by the cardinal virtues, against idolatry and the corresponding vices.
* &quot;Libri contra Symmachum&quot; -- (&quot;Books Against Symmachus&quot;) oppose the pagan senator Symmachus&#x27;s requests that the altar of Victory, which had been removed by Gratian, be restored to the Senate house.
* &quot;Dittochæon&quot; -- (&quot;The Double Testament&quot;) contains 49 quatrains intended as captions for the murals of a basilica in Rome.

<text>Franklin Clark Fry (August 30, 1900 – June 6, 1968) was a leading American Lutheran clergyman, known for his work on behalf of interdenominational unity.

==Early years==

Fry&#x27;s parents were Franklin Foster Fry and Minnie C. Fry, née McKeown. He was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on August 30, 1900; he had no brothers or sisters. He attended Hamilton College in Clinton, New York; the American School of Classical Studies at Athens; and the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was ordained in Ithaca on June 10, 1925. Following his ordination, Fry served as pastor for congregations in Yonkers, New York, and Akron, Ohio.

==Interdenominational work==
In 1944, Fry was elected president of the United Lutheran Church in America, one of the larger of many U.S. Lutheran denominations, which had been established in 1918 with the merger of three independent German synods. He expressed a wry ambivalence following his election, claiming that he &quot;would much rather have a pastorate than squirt grease into ecclesiastical machinery&quot;.

Nonetheless, during his time as president, Fry became known among many church leaders as &quot;Mr. Protestant&quot;, a moniker that captured his tireless work on behalf of greater unity among Protestant church bodies and made famous by the cover story on Fry in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1958. Seeing it as his mission to heal the Christian church&#x27;s fragmentation into numerous splinter groups, Fry was a prime mover behind the formation of the Lutheran World Federation in 1947, the World Council of Churches in 1948, and the National Council of Churches in 1950. Among his many activities with these groups, Fry presided over the constituting convention of the National Council of Churches, and he headed the policy-making central committee of the World Council of Churches. He described the World Council as a means to &quot;hold Christianity together, to keep the means of communication open, to keep conversation going even if there is no success in our lifetime.&quot; Fry also became president of the 72-million-member Lutheran World Federation in 1957.

==Forming the Lutheran Church in America==

In the early 1960s, the nation&#x27;s many independent Lutheran church bodies moved progressively toward greater unity. A number of such bodies merged in 1960, for example, to form the American Lutheran Church. From his position as head of the United Lutheran Church in America, Fry engineered a similar move in 1962, organizing the merger of his own church with three other independent bodies –- the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, the American Evangelical Lutheran Church, and the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church –- to form the Lutheran Church in America (LCA), of which he was elected president.

Fry was elected as the head of the Lutheran World Federation in 1957 making him the most powerful figure among U.S. Lutherans, and one of the most influential leaders of world Protestantism. The new LCA cut across traditional ethnic distinctions among Finnish, Danish, German, and Swedish Lutherans, and with 3.3 million members was the largest Lutheran church body in the United States. Theologically, the LCA was most often considered the most liberal and ecumenical branch in American Lutheranism. In church governance, the LCA was clerical and centralistic, in contrast to the congregationalist or &quot;low church&quot; strain in American Christianity.

His accumulation of jobs was very impressive, serving as chairman of the policy making Central and Executive Committees of the World Council of Churches, and as a member of the Policy and Strategy Committee of the National Council of Churches. At the same time, he was president (since 1944) of the United Lutheran Church in America, a member of the Executive Committee of the National Lutheran Council, and the first American ever elected president of the 50-million-member Lutheran World Federation.

Fry lived in New Rochelle in Westchester, New York, commuting to his offices in Manhattan in the former J.P. Morgan mansion on Madison Avenue in Manhattan.

In 1962 he was chosen as &quot;Clergy Churchman of the Year&quot; by the Religious Heritage of America.

In January 1968, Fry issued a stirring appeal to fellow church members to &quot;unstop your ears&quot; to the need for a &quot;massive improvement in the lot of Negro ghettos,&quot; warning of the prospects for &quot;spiraling and spreading violence&quot; if racial justice were not achieved swiftly.

Fry, as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; put it several years after his death, was &quot;known everywhere for his brilliant parliamentarian tactics, his shortcutting of time-consuming wrangles, the pungency with which he cut through intricate debate snarls, and for his wit and incisive dominance of any situation.&quot; He was also known as a fan of the New York Yankees baseball club.

==Death and aftermath==

Fry resigned midway through his second four-year term as president of the LCA , only days before his death of cancer, when it became apparent that he had not long to live. The Rev. Dr. Robert J. Marshall, president of the LCA&#x27;s Illinois Synod, was selected to fill the remainder of Fry&#x27;s term, and Marshall went on to win the office in his own right in 1970. Fry died of cancer at New Rochelle Hospital on June 6, 1968.

His funeral, held at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in Manhattan, New York City, was attended by dozens of church leaders from around the world. Fry is buried at Augustus Lutheran Church in Trappe, Pennsylvania. His son, Franklin Drewes Fry, followed him into the ministry, was a leading clergyman in the ELCA, and died in 2006 at the age of 78. The Lutheran Church in America, meanwhile, followed Fry&#x27;s ecumenical blueprint by merging in 1988 with two other Lutheran groups to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, today the largest and most liberal U.S. Lutheran church body.

<text>Knut Frydenlund (31 March 1927 – 26 February 1987) was a Norwegian diplomat and politician for the Labour Party who served as foreign minister from 1973 to 1981 and again from 1986 to 1987.

Frydenlund was born in Drammen and began his diplomatic career in the 1950s, initially serving at the Norwegian embassy in Bonn, and served in various diplomatic positions during the 1950s and the 1960s. In 1969, he was elected to parliament as a member of the Norwegian Labour Party, and he became foreign minister in the Labour government in 1973. While Labour was out of power from 1981 to 1986, he was replaced as foreign minister by Svenn Thorkild Stray, but returned to the office in May 1986.

In February 1987, following his return from a Nordic Council meeting in Helsinki, Frydenlund collapsed at Oslo&#x27;s Fornebu Airport due to a cerebral hemorrhage and died soon afterward at Ullevaal Hospital in Oslo.

<text>Flickerstick is an American alternative rock band from Fort Worth, Texas.

==Band history==

===Band formation and early years===
Flickerstick was formed in Fort Worth, Texas, by high school friends Brandin Lea (lead singer, guitarist) and Cory Kreig (guitarist, keyboardist). The two, who were guitarists in another local band, decided to put a band together and picked some friends to join them, including Brandin&#x27;s brother, Fletcher (bassist). The band started doing local gigs.

They played clubs in Dallas, adding Dallas-based drummer Dominic Weir, who started playing shows. The band borrowed $10,000 and made their first album titled &quot;Welcoming Home the Astronauts&quot;. The album sold in the Dallas area and at shows, and the band received local airplay.

===VH1&#x27;s Bands on the Run===
During this time, VH1 invited them to audition for the &quot;Bands on the Run&quot; television show, after initial interest in them for a show about bands that include relatives. After auditioning among over 2,000 bands, Flickerstick was chosen to be one of the four in the series. The winner was to be the band that made the most money at the door and from merchandise sales, with a &quot;battle of the bands&quot; before each elimination of the lowest-earning band, with the winner (chosen by audience vote) protected from elimination. Flickerstick won the first two &quot;battle of the bands&quot; to avoid elimination, and was lagging in sales by well over $3,000.00 in the final episode, when it was announced that Guitar Center was offering a purse of $5,000.00 for the winner of the final &quot;battle.&quot; The votes for the winner were cast by audience members each worth one point, then a private group of music insiders each voted with a worth of 5 points each. It was announced that Flickerstick won that final &quot;battle&quot; and the grand prize for the series.

===Post-show===
After six months of shows, the band was signed by Epic Records. In November 2001, Epic re-released the band&#x27;s debut album which received reviews in Rolling Stone (3.5 out of 5 stars) along with moderate to well received reviews in other music publications. The album was re-worked with the help of veteran producer Rick Beato and was remixed by Tom Lord-Alge. The reissued album debuted at #2 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and #150 on the Billboard Top 200.

Flickerstick was in New York City on September 11, 2001, for a sold-out show at the famed Irving Plaza. In an interview with Rock Eyez a local New Jersey music blog, Brandin Lea stated that being in New York on 9/11 was &quot;horrific&quot; and that would be the one thing he would change from the band&#x27;s career. In other interviews, members of the band have cited the change in the record industry and economy in general (resulting in Epic&#x27;s lackluster promotion of the album) after the 9/11 terrorist attacks as reasons for their departure with Epic.

A year later their Epic contract was canceled out for an undisclosed amount, and the band bought ownership of the album from the label. They then signed with What Are Records and released a live album titled &quot;Causing a Catastrophe&quot; that same year. After the album&#x27;s release drummer Dominic Weir was fired from the band for personality conflicts. After his dismissal he continued to play with another project, Mermaid Purse, before eventually joining Smile Empty Soul. He was replaced in Flickerstick by ex-Doosu drummer Todd Harwell.

On October 14, 2003, Flickerstick self-released an EP/DVD combo entitled &quot;To Madagascar and Back&quot;.

=== Final years and breakup ===

On October 5, 2004, Flickerstick released their second album &quot;Tarantula&quot; on the Dallas-based indie label Idol Records. The band had toured statewide as well as the UK in support of the record. Founding guitarist Cory Kreig left the band in April 2005 towards the end of the tour for personal reasons. Brandin was able to recruit veteran songwriter Tim Locke, who also handled lead vocals and guitar for Dallas-based alternative band Coma Rally and alt-country band Calhoun, to fill Cory&#x27;s place in the band.

On April 3, 2007, the band released &quot;Live from Atlanta: Two Nights at Sound Tree Studios&quot; which was named as a result of a two-day, fan-invite recording weekend in September 2006 at Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta. Fans joined the band at night in a live recording room at the studio, and celebrated being part of the band&#x27;s live taping sessions. The album featured six new songs that had not been recorded before. The album also featured a special studio track called &quot;Helicopter,&quot; along with three videos from the recording sessions in September. The record was engineered by industry veteran Shawn Grove.

Rumors of breakup gained momentum after the band&#x27;s website was taken offline for nonpayment in July 2008. It was confirmed by the band on their MySpace page in January 2009 with the following statement: 
After a hiatus of more than a year, the band (minus bassist Fletcher Lea) resurfaced to perform a series of farewell shows:

=== Reunion ===

On October 22, 2021, Flickerstick released &quot;When We Were Young: Singles, B-Sides &amp; Rarities, 1997–2004&quot;. Around this release, the band&#x27;s long dormant Twitter and Facebook began receiving regular posts of archival content, much of it never before seen.

On November 15, 2021, the band reunited in the same room for the first time since 2005 to celebrate the re-release of Welcoming Home the Astronauts, discuss their touring years and address rumors of a comeback with Fort Worth Magazine.

Regarding a reunion, Lea said, Fletcher, Weir and Kreig expressed a willingness to consider reunion shows as well.

On January 4, 2022, it was announced on Flickerstick official social media posts that the band would be reuniting for one show with all 5 original band members. The reunion concert took place at the House of Blues in Dallas Texas on June 25, 2022. Due to popular demand, the band added a second performance to the reunion, which took place at the same venue on June 24, 2022.

On June 18, 2022, it was announced on the band&#x27;s official facebook page that the reunion would proceed past the 2 announced reunion shows. Brandin, Rex and Todd would be reuniting with fellow DFW musician Beau Wagener and vocalist &amp; bass guitarist Fatima Thomas joining the band as well. On September 11, the new line-up released their first single titled &quot;Shine On.&quot;

<text>Louis Agassiz Fuertes (February 7, 1874 – August 22, 1927) was an American ornithologist, illustrator and artist who set the rigorous and current-day standards for ornithological art and naturalist depiction and is considered one of the most prolific American bird artists, second only to his guiding professional predecessor John James Audubon.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Fuertes was born in Ithaca, New York, and was the son of Puerto Rican astronomer and civil engineer Estevan Fuertes and Mary Stone Perry Fuertes. His father was the founding professor of the School of Civil Engineering at Cornell University, and for many years served as the dean of the college. Estevan named his son after the Swiss-born American naturalist Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz, who had died the year before. Fuertes&#x27;s mother, born in Troy, New York, was of Dutch ancestry.

Young Louis became interested in birds at a very early age, killing birds with a slingshot and examining them carefully.

As a child, he had been influenced by John James Audubon&#x27;s &quot;The Birds of America&quot;. At the age of fourteen, he made his first painting of a live bird, a male red crossbill. He learned to keep careful records of the appearance, habits and voices of birds.

In 1890, he sent a specimen that he collected to the Smithsonian and received stellar praise and glowing comments on its rarity and accuracy and in 1891, at the age of 17, Louis became the youngest member ever named as an Associate Member of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union.

He was encouraged by his father&#x27;s colleagues at Cornell including Burt G. Wilder and Liberty H. Bailey.

In June 1892, he accompanied his parents to Europe and sketched birds and animals at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris.

In September, he joined the Institute of Keller, a school in Zurich, staying on for a year.

===Cornell University===
Returning to the United States, he enrolled in Cornell in 1893, choosing to study architecture.

His older brother James, however shared in a memoir that Louis lacked a passion for geometry and mathematics and would often fall asleep when James tried to coach him. During one college lecture, Louis climbed out a classroom window and sat completely still in a tree to investigate a strange bird call he had never heard before.

His interest in singing led him to join the Cornell University Glee Club. In 1894, the Glee Club went on a tour to Washington, D.C., where another member of the club suggested that Louis meet his uncle Elliott Coues, who was also keenly interested in birds. This meeting was a turning point, as Coues recognized Fuertes&#x27; talent and spread the word about his already distinguished work. In 1895 Coues exhibited fifty of the works of Fuertes at the Congress of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union at Washington, a meeting that Louis was unable to attend. He received the first of his many commissions for illustrating birds while still an undergraduate.

At Cornell, he was elected to the Sphinx Head Society, the oldest senior honor society at the University. He was also a member of Alpha Delta Phi which he joined having been lifelong friends with famed horticulturalist and naturalist Theodore Luqueer Mead, one of his father&#x27;s former students and member of the fraternity.

In 1896, Coues invited Fuertes to attend the Ornithological Congress at Cambridge in England.

===Career and personal life===

After graduating from Cornell in 1897 he became an apprentice to the painter Abbott H. Thayer. In 1898, he made his first expedition, with Thayer and his son Gerald, to Florida. In 1899, Fuertes accompanied E. H. Harriman on his famous exploration of the Alaska coastline, the Harriman Alaska Expedition.

Fuertes later traveled across much of the United States and to many countries in pursuit of birds, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and Ethiopia. Fuertes collaborated with Frank Chapman, curator of the American Museum of Natural History, on many assignments including field research, background dioramas at the museum, and book illustrations. While on a collecting expedition with Chapman in Mexico, Fuertes discovered a species of oriole. Chapman named it &quot;Icterus fuertesi&quot;, commonly called Fuertes&#x27;s oriole after his friend.

In 1904 Fuertes married Margaret F. Sumner and they had a son, Louis Sumner, and a daughter, Mary.

Fuertes regularly lectured on ornithology at Cornell University beginning in 1923. Fuertes was an able imitator of bird song and even made a trial recording for a Victor record in 1913.

In 1926–27 he participated in the Field Museum&#x27;s Abyssinian Expedition led by Wilfred Hudson Osgood. He produced some of his most exquisite bird and mammal watercolors as a result of this trip.

===Death===
Upon his return from Ethiopia, Fuertes visited Frank Chapman at Tannersville, New York. Returning from the meeting, his car was hit by a train at a railroad crossing near Unadilla, New York, and he was killed. A load of hay had concealed the oncoming train. His wife was seriously injured but survived.

By a twist of fate, the paintings he carried all survived undamaged. This extraordinary and rare collection was later purchased from Mrs. Fuertes by C. Suydam Cutting.

Fuertes is buried at Lake View Cemetery in Ithaca, New York.

==Memorials and legacy==

Fuertes is commemorated by two species. One is a species named by his colleague Frank Chapman as &quot;Icterus fuertesi&quot;, although it is now considered a subspecies of the orchard oriole. The other, Fuertes&#x27;s parrot, or &quot;Hapalopsittaca fuertesi&quot;, was rediscovered in 2002 after 91 years of presumed extinction.

In 1927, the Boy Scouts of America made Fuertes an &quot;Honorary Scout&quot;, a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to &quot;American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys...&quot;. The other eighteen who were awarded this distinction were: Roy Chapman Andrews; Robert Bartlett; Frederick Russell Burnham; Richard E. Byrd; George Kruck Cherrie; James L. Clark; Merian C. Cooper; Lincoln Ellsworth; George Bird Grinnell; Charles A. Lindbergh; Donald Baxter MacMillan; Clifford H. Pope; George Palmer Putnam; Kermit Roosevelt; Carl Rungius; Stewart Edward White; Orville Wright.

Apart from mentoring George Miksch Sutton, Fuertes influenced many later wildlife artists including Roger Tory Peterson, Jörg Kühn, Courtenay Brandreth, and Conrad Roland. The Wilson Ornithological Society established the Louis Agassiz Fuertes Award in 1947. Fuertes also painted dozens of mammal portraits for &quot;The National Geographic Magazine&quot; in 1916 and 1918, and inspired the Society to hire an artist of their own, Walter A. Weber.

Many of Fuertes&#x27; paintings still remain popular and in very high demand today. In particular, a 1924 oil painting, &quot;Wild Turkey&quot;, sold for $86,250 at a January 2012 auction in New York and his other works command even higher prices to private collectors around the world. Fuertes&#x27; love of animals and landscapes comes through in his paintings; there is a notable vivacity and excitement present in his work that has created long-term value.

==Selected works==

Fuertes&#x27; earliest commissions included 25 large decorative panels for F. F. Brewster of New Haven, Connecticut. This was followed by some murals at the Flamingo Hotel, of Miami, Florida and some paintings for the New York Zoological Society. He was much sought after later, illustrating books, plates for journals and magazine. Working with impressions from the field and from freshly collected specimens, Fuertes&#x27; works are considered some of the most accurate and natural depictions of birds. He had an ability to capture the bird in action and reproduce illustrations from a mental image. Apart from illustrations, he wrote some full length articles including one on falconry in the National Geographic and another on dogs. The cover of the journal &quot;Auk&quot; published by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union was designed by Fuertes. Some of the books that he illustrated include:

<doc id="729932" wikidata="Q4978331" url="?curid=729932" title="Bruce Strauss">
<text>Bruce Strauss (born February 6, 1952) is an American retired boxer who competed in the middleweight division, his nickname was The Mouse. He achieved notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s after fighting, and generally losing, to a wide variety of opponents, with him also being known for his cheery, easy-going personality. His life was made into the well-received 1997 comedy-drama film &quot;The Mouse&quot;, in which he was portrayed by actor John Savage.

Generally a middleweight using a &quot;colorful&quot; fighting style, Strauss opened his career on June 1, 1976, with a four-round decision win over Gary Maize (also listed as &quot;Gary Maiza&quot;) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He has estimated that he has fought over 300 times over the years, with most matches taking place through using aliases and other forms of subterfuge to get around rules. His long career took him to multiple continents and saw him facing a large group of opponents.

==Career and personal life==
First dubbed &quot;Mousie&quot; during his school years in New Milford, New Jersey, Strauss began intensive bodybuilding while in high school. From his early boxing days, he was often described as a &quot;journeyman&quot;, a title given to fighters who typically fight anyone and anywhere, often on short notice. Nevertheless, he became famous around boxing circles because of the number of fights he lost by knockout. Officially, he lost 28 fights by knockout out of a total of 53 losses, but it has been estimated that, combined with his fights using the Ruben Bardot alias, he might have actually lost more than 150 fights by knockout. He himself has made mockery of his knockout loss number, stating that he is &quot;probably the only boxer in history that has lost by knockout on every continent.&quot;

He once joked that the only reason that he hadn&#x27;t fought and lost in Antarctica was that he hated being cold. In a 1990 Kayo boxing cards set, he posed while sitting on the canvas, with black make-up covering his eye, as he held on to a ring rope. As stated before, he would sometimes use the alias of &quot;Ruben Bardot&quot; to obtain fights.

Strauss has revealed that he got around rules forcing boxers to wait a certain amount of time, over a month, before fighting again by measures such as donning disguises and filling his pockets with lead to change his weight class. The book &quot;Boxing in America: An Autopsy&quot; labeled him a &quot;colorful&quot; fighter that became &quot;something of a legend&quot;. It remarked as well that he &quot;made a habit of doing whatever it took to survive at times&quot;, noting how Strauss once quipped to a referee upset with Strauss&#x27; unfair low blows that &quot;Well, it ain&#x27;t fair that he&#x27;s better than me, neither.&quot;

A 1997 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Strauss as a &quot;tireless but inept &#x27;professional opponent&#x27;&quot;, while also comparing him to &quot;the stock caricature of the cuddly loudmouthed palooka.&quot; The newspaper also stated, &quot;For Bruce, losing isn&#x27;t just a reliable way of make a living, it&#x27;s his personal philosophy.&quot; Strauss has declared that most of his matches weren&#x27;t done in his own name, having fought (and mostly lost) more than three hundred times in his long career in his estimation.

His career began on June 1, 1976, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, when Strauss debuted as a professional boxer. Outpointing Gary Maize (also listed as &#x27;Gary Maiza&#x27;) after four rounds, he soon set off on the road. His first official knockout defeat came at the hands of Mauricio Aldana on January 10, 1979, fighting in Las Vegas. Strauss also lost fights by knockout in Africa (Cameroon, South Africa), Europe (France, Germany, and Italy), South America (Peru), and Oceania (Fiji). It is unclear whether he actually lost a fight by knockout in Australia or Asia under the &quot;Ruben Bardot&quot; alias.

Strauss fought a number of top challengers and world champions in the middleweight division, including Charlie Weir, Bobby Czyz, Eckhard Dagge, Al Ford, Billy Collins, Mike McCallum, Marlon Starling, David Braxton, and Davey Hilton, among others. He also fought former World Lightweight Champion Harry Arroyo.

His last official fight was a six-round decision win over Terry Jesmer on November 24, 1989. The match took place in Bismarck, North Dakota inside the city&#x27;s Civic Center.

Strauss officially has a record of 78 wins, 53 losses, and 6 draws (ties), although it has also been reported as 77 wins compared to 53 losses and 6 ties. He is additionally reported to have, officially, 55 knockout wins and 28 knockout losses. As remarked before, he typically fought as a middleweight and used an orthodox stance.

In 1997, a movie was released based on his career entitled &quot;The Mouse&quot;, in which actor John Savage portrayed him. Written and directed by Dan Adams, the comedy-drama film also starred actress Angelica Torn as Mary Lou Strauss, the Mouse&#x27;s wife. The movie received praise from publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Also featuring comedian Rip Torn, the film featured a number of cameo appearances from well-known boxers such as Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb, Ray Mancini, Vito Antuofermo, and Sean O&#x27;Grady.

<doc id="729933" wikidata="Q217734" url="?curid=729933" title="Kenichi Fukui">
<text>was a Japanese chemist. He became the first person of East Asian ancestry to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry when he won the 1981 prize with Roald Hoffmann, for their independent investigations into the mechanisms of chemical reactions. Fukui&#x27;s prize-winning work focused on the role of frontier orbitals in chemical reactions: specifically that molecules share loosely bonded electrons which occupy the frontier orbitals, that is, the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO).

== Early life ==
Fukui was the eldest of three sons of Ryokichi Fukui, a foreign trade merchant, and Chie Fukui. He was born in Nara, Japan. In his student days between 1938 and 1941, Fukui&#x27;s interest was stimulated by quantum mechanics and Erwin Schrödinger&#x27;s equation. He also had developed the belief that a breakthrough in science occurs through the unexpected fusion of remotely related fields.

In an interview with &quot;The Chemical Intelligencer&quot; Kenichi discusses his path towards chemistry starting from middle school.

&quot;The reason for my selection of chemistry is not easy to explain, since chemistry was never my favorite branch in middle school and high school years. Actually, the fact that my respected Fabre had been a genius in chemistry had captured my heart latently, the most decisive occurrence in my education career came when my father asked the advice of Professor Gen-itsu Kita of the Kyoto Imperial University concerning the cause I should take.”
On the advice of Kita, a personal friend of the elder Fukui, young Kenichi was directed to the Department of Industrial Chemistry, with which Kita was then affiliated. He also explains that chemistry was difficult to him because it seemed to require memorization to learn it, and that he preferred more logical character in chemistry. He followed the advice a mentor that was well respected by Kenichi himself and never looked back. He also followed in those footsteps by attending Kyoto University in Japan. During that same interview Kenichi also discussed his reason for preferring more theoretical chemistry rather than experimental chemistry. Although he certainly acceded at theoretical science he actually spent much of his early research on experimental. Kenichi had quickly completed more than 100 experimental projects and papers, and he rather enjoyed the experimental phenomena of chemistry. In fact, later on when teaching he would recommend experimental thesis projects for his students to balance them out, theoretical science came more natural to students, but by suggesting or assigning experimental projects his students could understand the concept of both, as all scientist should. Following his graduation from Kyoto Imperial University in 1941, Fukui was engaged in the Army Fuel Laboratory of Japan during World War II. In 1943, he was appointed a lecturer in fuel chemistry at Kyoto Imperial University and began his career as an experimental organic chemist.

== Research ==

He was professor of physical chemistry at Kyoto University from 1951 to 1982, president of the Kyoto Institute of Technology between 1982 and 1988, and a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science and honorary member of the International Academy of Science, Munich. He was also director of the Institute for Fundamental Chemistry from 1988 till his death. As well as President of the Chemical Society of Japan from 1983–84, receiving multiple awards aside from his Nobel Prize such as; Japan Academy Prize in 1962, Person of Cultural Merit in 1981, Imperial Honour of Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1988, with many other awards not quite as prestigious.

In 1952, Fukui with his young collaborators T. Yonezawa and H. Shingu presented his molecular orbital theory of reactivity in aromatic hydrocarbons, which appeared in the &quot;Journal of Chemical Physics&quot;. At that time, his concept failed to garner adequate attention among chemists. Fukui observed in his Nobel lecture in 1981 that his original paper &#x27;received a number of controversial comments. This was in a sense understandable, because for lack of my experiential ability, the theoretical foundation for this conspicuous result was obscure or rather improperly given.&#x27;

The frontier orbitals concept came to be recognized following the 1965 publication by Robert B. Woodward and Roald Hoffmann of the Woodward-Hoffmann stereoselection rules, which could predict the reaction rates between two reactants. These rules, depicted in diagrams, explain why some pairs react easily while other pairs do not. The basis for these rules lies in the symmetry properties of the molecules and especially in the disposition of their electrons. Fukui had acknowledged in his Nobel lecture that, &#x27;It is only after the remarkable appearance of the brilliant work by Woodward and Hoffmann that I have become fully aware that not only the density distribution but also the nodal property of the particular orbitals have significance in such a wide variety of chemical reactions.&#x27;

What has been striking in Fukui&#x27;s significant contributions is that he developed his ideas before chemists had access to large computers for modeling. Apart from exploring the theory of chemical reactions, Fukui&#x27;s contributions to chemistry also include the statistical theory of gelation, organic synthesis by inorganic salts and polymerization kinetics.

In an interview to &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine in 1985, Fukui had been highly critical on the practices adopted in Japanese universities and industries to foster science. He noted, &quot;Japanese universities have a chair system that is a fixed hierarchy. This has its merits when trying to work as a laboratory on one theme. But if you want to do original work you must start young, and young people are limited by the chair system. Even if students cannot become assistant professors at an early age they should be encouraged to do original work.&quot; Fukui also admonished Japanese industrial research stating, &quot;Industry is more likely to put its research effort into its daily business. It is very difficult for it to become involved in pure chemistry. There is a need to encourage long-range research, even if we don&#x27;t know its goal and if its application is unknown.&quot; In another interview with &quot;The Chemical Intelligencer&quot; he further elaborates on his criticism by saying, &quot;As is known worldwide, Japan has tried to catch up with the western countries since the beginning of this century by importing science from them.&quot; Japan is, in a sense, relatively new to fundamental science as a part of its society and the lack of originality ability, and funding which the western countries have more advantages in hurt the country in fundamental science. Although, he has also stated that it is improving in Japan, especially funding for fundamental science as it has seen a steady increase for years.

== Recognition ==
Fukui was awarded the Nobel Prize for his realization that a good approximation for reactivity could be found by looking at the frontier orbitals (HOMO/LUMO). This was based on three main observations of molecular orbital theory as two molecules interact.
# The occupied orbitals of different molecules repel each other.
# Positive charges of one molecule attract the negative charges of the other.
# The occupied orbitals of one molecule and the unoccupied orbitals of the other (especially HOMO and LUMO) interact with each other causing attraction.
From these observations, frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory simplifies reactivity to interactions between HOMO of one species and the LUMO of the other. This helps to explain the predictions of the Woodward-Hoffman rules for thermal pericyclic reactions, which are summarized in the following statement: &quot;A ground-state pericyclic change is symmetry-allowed when the total number of (4q+2)s and (4r)a components is odd&quot;

Fukui was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1989.

<text>Ben Hebard Fuller (February 27, 1870 – June 8, 1937) was a major general in the United States Marine Corps and served as the 15th Commandant of the Marine Corps between 1930 and 1934.

==Biography==
Born in Big Rapids, Michigan, Fuller was a member of the United States Naval Academy class of 1889. After serving two years of service as a naval cadet, a requirement at the time before commissioning, he was appointed a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on July 1, 1891. He, with six other members of his class, attended the first course for new Marine officers at the School of Application, which was the prototype for today&#x27;s Basic School.

On 26 October 1892, he married Katherine Heaton Offley. Together, they had two children.

Captain Fuller participated in the Battle of Novaleta, Philippine Islands on October 8, 1899, and was commended for gallant, meritorious, and courageous conduct in the Battle of Tientsin, China on July 13, 1900.

From 1904 to 1906, he served at the Naval Station, Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii. In June and July 1908, he was on detached duty with an expeditionary force organized for service in Panama, and from August of that year until January 1910, commanded a Marine Battalion at Camp Elliott, Panama Canal Zone. From March to June 1911, he commanded the 3rd Regiment of Marines at Camp Meyer, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

From 1911 to 1915, he commanded various posts and stations in the United States, and during this period also, he completed the Field Officers’ Course at the Army Service Schools, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the course at the Army War College, Washington, D.C. Following a tour of duty as Fleet Marine Officer of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, from January 1915 to June 1916, LtCol Fuller was assigned to the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island, where he successfully completed the course.

In August 1918, he was assigned to command the 2nd Brigade of Marines in the Dominican Republic, remaining there until October 1920. He also served on the Staff of the Military Governor of Santo Domingo as Secretary of State, Interior, Police, War and Navy, from December 1919, until his detachment departed from Santo Domingo.

From November 1920 to July 1922, he served on the staff of the Naval War College, Newport, and from July 1922 to January 1923, commanded the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Virginia. In January 1924, he assumed command of the 1st Brigade of Marines in the Republic of Haiti, with headquarters at Port-au-Prince, and served in this capacity until December 8, 1925.

Following his return to the United States from Haiti, Brigadier General Fuller was assigned to Headquarters Marine Corps as President of the Marine Examining and Retiring Board, serving in that capacity until July 1928, when he was appointed Assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps. In September 1928 he was designated as the first Officer in Charge, United States Marine Corps Reserve, when a separate reserve section was created to administer that organization in the Office of the Commandant. During November and December of that year he was on the Reserve Board that was formed to set policy. Fuller was the head of the Reserve until May 1929.

Following the death of the Commandant, Major General Wendell C. Neville on July 9, 1930, Brigadier General Fuller was promoted to major general and appointed Commandant of the Marine Corps. He served in that capacity until March 1, 1934, when he was retired from active service, having attained the statutory retirement age of sixty-four years.

Major General Fuller&#x27;s tenure was a period of general retrenchment and withdrawal of Marines from foreign countries. Beginning in 1933, these Marines composed the newly designated Fleet Marine Force, the principal operating force of the Marine Corps.

Major General Fuller died on June 8, 1937, aged 67, at the U.S. Naval Hospital, Washington, D.C., and was buried on June 11, 1937, in the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery at Annapolis, Maryland, beside the grave of his son, Captain Edward C. Fuller of the 6th Marine Regiment, who was killed in action in the Battle of Belleau Wood during World War I.

<text>Ida Mable Fuller Pierce (November 28, 1854 – September 26, 1930) was one of the founders of Sigma Kappa sorority.

==Early life==
Ida Fuller was born on November 28, 1854, in Albion, Maine. Her parents were Louise J. and David B. Fuller. She grew up in Albion. Fuller completed the Ladies Preparatory Course at the Waterville Classical Institute in Waterville, Maine.

She was twenty years old when she decided to attend Colby College, the first New England college to go fully co-educational. Although Fuller men had always attended Colby, her brother Blin Fuller refused to go to Colby if she enrolled. When she passed the entrance exam and was accepted by Colby in 1873, Blin decided to go to Bowdoin College instead. 

While at Colby College, she helped establish Sigma Kappa sorority in 1874. However, she left the college during her junior year due to illness and never graduated.

== Sigma Kappa ==
Only four other women attended Colby College with Fuller in 1873. Fuller and Mary Caffrey Low Carver, Elizabeth Gorham Hoag, Frances Elliott Mann Hall, and Louise Helen Coburn decided to form a literary and social society. (Coburn and Hoag were classmates of Fuller at the Waterville Classical Institute.) They were instructed by the college administration that they would need to present a constitution and bylaws with a petition requesting permission to form Sigma Kappa Sorority. They began work during that year, and on November 9, 1874, received a letter from the faculty approving their petition. 

Fuller continued to be active in the sorority after graduation and marriage. She helped her niece, Abby Louise Fuller, established the &quot;Xi chapter&quot; of Sigma Kappa at the University of Kansas. Blin&#x27;s other daughter, Illde W. Fuller, also joined the &quot;Xi chapter&quot;. Ida Fuller Pierce also served as the &quot;Xi chapter&#x27;s&quot; housemother. 

She was honored at the sorority&#x27;s 39th annual convention in Denver, Colorado in July 1913. She also gave an address about coeducation. She also attended the 1924 Golden Jubilee Convention of Sigma Kappa.

== Personal life ==
After leaving Colby College, Fuller went to Kansas in 1880 to seek a drier climate for her health. In Kansas, she met and married Jonathan B. Pierce on July 7, 1878. Pierce was a physician and pharmacist. The couple lived in Eureka, Kansas, where she was active in club and social life. Her husband predeceased her in May 5, 1890.

After her husband died in 1890, she was the vice-president of a Kansas bank and established the Girls&#x27; Hotel in Kansas City, an affordable accommodation for lower-income women. During World War I, she was in charge of organizing supply depots for the American Red Cross in Eureka and also lectured on food conservation across the United States. She was a relief worker during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

In her last two years, she lived at 1176 Sunnyhill Road in Oakland, California, with Mrs. F. G. Battram. She died on September 26, 1930, aged 76, in Oakland. She was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Eureka.

<text>Ida May Fuller (September 6, 1874 – January 27, 1975) was a Vermont schoolteacher and legal secretary. She was most notable as the first beneficiary of recurring monthly Social Security payments.

==Early life==
Fuller was born at her family&#x27;s Jewell Brook Road farm in Ludlow, Vermont, on September 6, 1874, the daughter of Henry W. Fuller and Laura (Haven) Fuller. Fuller&#x27;s family traced its American roots to &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers Samuel and Edward Fuller, and to Peregrine White, the first child born in America to English parents. She attended school in Ludlow and graduated from Black River Academy, where her contemporaries at the academy included Calvin Coolidge. After her graduation, Fuller became a schoolteacher in Ludlow. In 1903 and 1904, Fuller was a student in the business college course at the Pernin Institute of Shorthand and Bookkeeping in Boston.

==Career==
In 1905, Fuller became a stenographer, legal secretary, and bookkeeper at the Ludlow law firm of John G. Sargent, William W. Stickney, and Paul A. Chase. During Sargent&#x27;s service as Vermont Attorney General from 1908 to 1912, Fuller was his legal secretary and stenographer as he traveled throughout the state to carry out the duties of his office.

In addition to her career as a legal secretary, Fuller was active in Ludlow&#x27;s Baptist church, including terms as treasurer for missionary activities and church auditor. Fuller was also involved in civic causes, including serving as treasurer for Ludlow residents who pledged funds to pay for Chautauqua lecturers to visit the town each summer. She also took part in local business ventures, including the Ludlow Insurance Agency, of which she was an original incorporator.

Fuller worked under Social Security just shy of three years from the spring of 1937 to November 1939 and paid a total of $24.75 () in Social Security taxes. She filed her retirement claim on November 4, 1939, aged 65; while visiting Rutland, she stopped at the regional Social Security office to ask about benefits. She later observed: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that I expected anything, mind you, but I knew I&#x27;d been paying for something called Social Security and I wanted to ask the people in Rutland about it.&quot; Her application was transmitted to the Claims Division in Washington for adjudication. After approval, it was sent to the Treasury Department. Claims were grouped in batches of 1,000, and a certification list for each batch was sent to Treasury. Fuller&#x27;s claim was the first one on the first certification list, so the first Social Security check (check number 00-000-001), dated January 31, 1940, was issued to Fuller in the amount of $22.54 ().

==Later life==
During her retirement, Fuller collected a total of $22,888.92 () in Social Security benefits. As monthly payments increased in the 1950s and 1960s, Fuller typically received the first check issued for the new amount, which was usually the subject of news reports. When she received the first check following a September 1965 increase in monthly benefits, it arrived with a letter from President Lyndon Johnson, who also called Fuller to extend good wishes on her birthday.

Fuller never married and had no children. She lived most of her life in Ludlow and spent the last eight years of her life living with her niece, Hazel Perkins, in Brattleboro. Fuller died in Brattleboro on January 27, 1975, and was buried at Pleasant View Cemetery in Ludlow.

<doc id="729945" wikidata="Q216980" url="?curid=729945" title="Constantine P. Cavafy">
<text>Konstantinos Petrou Kavafis ( ; 29 April (OS 17 April), 1863 – 29 April 1933), known, especially in English, as Constantine P. Cavafy and often published as C. P. Cavafy (), was a Greek poet, journalist, and civil servant from Alexandria. A major figure of modern Greek literature, he is sometimes considered the most distinguished Greek poet of the 20th century. His works and consciously individual style earned him a place among the most important contributors not only to Greek poetry, but to Western poetry as a whole.

Cavafy&#x27;s poetic canon consists of 154 poems, while dozens more that remained incomplete or in sketch form weren&#x27;t published until much later. He consistently refused to publish his work in books, preferring to share it through local newspapers and magazines, or even print it himself and give it away to anyone who might be interested. His most important poems were written after his fortieth birthday, and were published two years after his death.

Cavafy&#x27;s work has been translated numerous times in many languages. His friend E. M. Forster, the novelist and literary critic, first introduced his poems to the English-speaking world in 1923; he referred to him as &quot;The Poet&quot;, famously describing him as &quot;a Greek gentleman in a straw hat, standing absolutely motionless at a slight angle to the universe.&quot; His work, as one translator put it, &quot;holds the historical and the erotic in a single embrace.&quot;

==Biography==

Cavafy was born in 1863 in Alexandria (then Ottoman Egypt) where his Greek parents settled in 1855; he was baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church, and had six older brothers. Originating from the Phanariot Greek community of Constantinople (now Istanbul), his father was named Petros Ioannis ()—hence the &quot;Petrou&quot; patronymic () in his name—and his mother Charicleia (; née Georgaki Photiades, ). His father was a prosperous merchant who had lived in England in earlier years and held both Greek and British nationality. Two years after his father&#x27;s sudden death in 1870, Cavafy and his family settled for a while in England, moving between Liverpool and London. In 1876, the family faced financial problems due to the Long Depression of 1873 and with their business now dissolved they moved back to Alexandria in 1877. Cavafy attended the Greek college &quot;Hermes&quot;, where he made his first close friends, and started drafting his own historical dictionary at age eighteen.

In 1882, disturbances in Alexandria caused the family to move, though again temporarily, to Constantinople, where they stayed at the house of his maternal grandfather, Georgakis Photiades. This was the year when a revolt broke out in Alexandria against the Anglo-French control of Egypt, thus precipitating the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War. During these events, Alexandria was bombarded, and the family apartment at Ramleh was burned. Upon his arrival in Constantinople, the nineteen-year old Cavafy first came in contact with his many relatives and started researching his ancestry, trying to define himself in the wider Hellenic context. There he started preparing for a career in journalism and politics, and began his first systematic attempts to write poetry.
In 1885, Cavafy returned to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life, leaving it only for excursions and travels abroad. After his arrival, he reacquired his Greek citizenship and abandoned the British citizenship, which his father had acquired in the late 1840s. He initially started working as a news correspondent at the journal &quot;Telegraphos&quot; (1886), he later worked at the stock exchange, and was eventually hired as a temporary, due to his foreign citizenship, clerk in the British-run Egyptian Ministry of Public Works. A conscientious worker, Cavafy held this position by renewing it annually for thirty years (Egypt remained a British protectorate until 1926). During these decades, a series of unexpected deaths of close friends and relatives would leave their mark on the poet. He published his poetry from 1891 to 1904 in the form of broadsheets, and only for his close friends. Any acclaim he was to receive came mainly from within the Greek community of Alexandria. Eventually, in 1903, he was introduced to mainland-Greek literary circles through a favourable review by Gregorios Xenopoulos. He received little recognition because his style differed markedly from the then-mainstream Greek poetry. It was only twenty years later, after the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), that a new generation of almost nihilist poets (e.g. Karyotakis) found inspiration in Cavafy&#x27;s work.

A biographical note written by Cavafy reads as follows:

In 1922, Cavafy quit his high-ranking position at the department of Public Works, an act that he characterized as liberation, and devoted himself to the completion of his poetic work. In 1926, the Greek state honoured Cavafy for his contribution to Greek letters by awarding him the Silver medal of the Order of Phoenix. He died of cancer of the larynx on 29 April 1933, his 70th birthday. Since his death, Cavafy&#x27;s reputation has grown; his poetry is taught in school in Greece and Cyprus, and in universities around the world.

E. M. Forster knew him personally and wrote a memoir of him, contained in his book &quot;Alexandria&quot;. Forster, Arnold J. Toynbee, and T. S. Eliot were among the earliest promoters of Cavafy in the English-speaking world before the Second World War. In 1966, David Hockney made a series of prints to illustrate a selection of Cavafy&#x27;s poems, including &quot;In the dull village&quot;.

==Work==
Cavafy&#x27;s complete literary corpus includes the 154 poems that constitute his poetic canon; his 75 unpublished or &quot;hidden&quot; poems, that were found completed in his archive or in the hands of friends, and weren&#x27;t published until 1968; his 37 rejected poems, which he published but later renounced; his 30 incomplete poems that were found unfinished in his archive; as well as numerous other prose poems, essays, and letters. According to the poet&#x27;s instructions, his poems are classified into three categories: historical, philosophical, and hedonistic or sensual.

Cavafy was instrumental in the revival and recognition of Greek poetry both at home and abroad. His poems are, typically, concise but intimate evocations of real or literary figures and &quot;milieux&quot; that have played roles in Greek culture. Some of the defining themes are uncertainty about the future, sensual pleasures, the moral character and psychology of individuals, homosexuality, and a fatalistic existential nostalgia. Besides his subjects, unconventional for the time, his poems also exhibit a skilled and versatile craftsmanship, which is extremely difficult to translate. Cavafy was a perfectionist, obsessively refining every single line of his poetry. His mature style was a free iambic form, free in the sense that verses rarely rhyme and are usually from 10 to 17 syllables. In his poems, the presence of rhyme usually implies irony.

Cavafy drew his themes from personal experience, along with a deep and wide knowledge of history, especially of the Hellenistic era. Many of his poems are pseudo-historical, or seemingly historical, or accurately but quirkily historical.

One of Cavafy&#x27;s most important works is his 1904 poem &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot;. The poem begins by describing a city-state in decline, whose population and legislators are waiting for the arrival of the barbarians. When night falls, the barbarians have not arrived. The poem ends: &quot;What is to become of us without barbarians? Those people were a solution of a sort.&quot; The poem influenced literary works such as &quot;The Tartar Steppe&quot; by Dino Buzzati (1940), &quot;The Opposing Shore&quot; (1951) by Julien Gracq, and &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot; (1980) by J. M. Coetzee.

In 1911, Cavafy wrote &quot;Ithaca&quot;, often considered his best-known poem, inspired by the Homeric return journey (&quot;nostos&quot;) of Odysseus to his home island, as depicted in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The poem&#x27;s theme is the destination which produces the journey of life: &quot;Keep Ithaca always in your mind. / Arriving there is what you&#x27;re destined for&quot;. The traveller should set out with hope, and at the end you may find Ithaca has no more riches to give you, but &quot;Ithaca gave you the marvelous journey&quot;.

Almost all of Cavafy&#x27;s work was in Greek; yet, his poetry remained unrecognized and underestimated in Greece, until after the publication of the first anthology in 1935 by Heracles Apostolidis (father of Renos Apostolidis). His unique style and language (which was a mixture of Katharevousa and Demotic Greek) had attracted the criticism of Kostis Palamas, the greatest poet of his era in mainland Greece, and his followers, who were in favour of the simplest form of Demotic Greek.

He is known for his prosaic use of metaphors, his brilliant use of historical imagery, and his aesthetic perfectionism. These attributes, amongst others, have assured him an enduring place in the literary pantheon of the Western World.

===Historical poems===
Cavafy wrote over a dozen historical poems about famous historical figures and regular people. He was mainly inspired by the Hellenistic era with Alexandria at primary focus. Other poems originate from Helleno-romaic antiquity and the Byzantine era. Mythological references are also present. The periods chosen are mostly of decline and decadence (e.g. Trojans); his heroes facing the final end. His historical poems include: &quot;The Glory of the Ptolemies&quot;, &quot;In Sparta&quot;, &quot;Come, O King of Lacedaemonians&quot;, &quot;The First Step&quot;, &quot;In the Year 200 B.C.&quot;, &quot;If Only They Had Seen to It&quot;, &quot;The Displeasure of Seleucid&quot;, &quot;Theodotus&quot;, &quot;Alexandrian Kings&quot;, &quot;In Alexandria, 31 B.C.&quot;, &quot;The God Forsakes Antony&quot;, &quot;In a Township of Asia Minor&quot;, &quot;Caesarion&quot;, &quot;The Potentate from Western Libya&quot;, &quot;Of the Hebrews (A.D. 50)&quot;, &quot;Tomb of Eurion&quot;, &quot;Tomb of Lanes&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Perilous Things&quot;, &quot;From the School of the Renowned Philosopher&quot;, &quot;A Priest of the Serapeum&quot;, &quot;Kleitos″ Illness&quot;, &quot;If Dead Indeed&quot;, &quot;In the Month of Athyr&quot;, &quot;Tomb of Ignatius&quot;, &quot;From Ammones Who Died Aged 29 in 610&quot;, &quot;Aemilianus Monae&quot;, &quot;Alexandrian, A.D. 628-655&quot;, &quot;Kaisarion (poem)&quot;, &quot;In Church&quot;, &quot;Morning Sea&quot; (a few poems about Alexandria were left unfinished at his death).

===Homoerotic poems===
Cavafy&#x27;s sensual poems are filled with the lyricism and emotion of same-sex love, inspired by recollection and remembrance. The past and former actions, sometimes along with the vision for the future underlie the muse of Cavafy in writing these poems. As poet George Kalogeris observes:

He is perhaps most popular today for his erotic verse, in which the Alexandrian youth[s] in his poems seem to have stepped right out of the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, and into a less accepting world that makes them vulnerable, and often keeps them in poverty, though the same Hellenic amber immures their beautiful bodies. The subjects of his poems often have a provocative glamour to them even in barest outline: the homoerotic one night stand that is remembered for a lifetime, the oracular pronouncement unheeded, the talented youth prone to self destruction, the offhand remark that indicates a crack in the imperial façade.

===Philosophical poems===
Also called instructive poems, they are divided into poems with consultations to poets, and poems that deal with other situations such as isolation (for example, &quot;The walls&quot;), duty (for example, &quot;Thermopylae&quot;), and human dignity (for example, &quot;The God Abandons Antony&quot;).

The poem &quot;Thermopylae&quot; reminds us of the famous battle of Thermopylae where the 300 Spartans and their allies fought against the greater numbers of Persians, although they knew that they would be defeated. There are some principles in our lives that we should live by, and Thermopylae is the ground of duty. We stay there fighting although we know that there is the potential for failure. (At the end the traitor Ephialtes will appear, leading the Persians through the secret trail).

In another poem, &quot;In the Year 200 B.C.&quot;, he comments on the historical epigram &quot;Alexander, son of Philip, and the Greeks, except of Lacedaemonians...&quot;, from the donation of Alexander to Athens after the Battle of the Granicus. Cavafy praises the Hellenistic era and idea, so condemning the closed-mind and localistic ideas about Hellenism. However, in other poems, his stance displays ambiguity between the Classical ideal and the Hellenistic era (which is sometimes described with a tone of decadence).

Another poem is the Epitaph of a Greek trader from Samos who was sold into slavery in India and dies on the shores of the Ganges: regretting the greed for riches which led him to sail so far away and end up &quot;among utter barbarians&quot;, expressing his deep longing for his homeland and his wish to die as &quot;In Hades I would be surrounded by Greeks&quot;.

==Museum==


Cavafy&#x27;s apartment in Alexandria is located on &quot;Lepsius&quot; street, which, after the apartment&#x27;s conversion to a museum, was renamed to &quot;Cavafy street&quot; in honour of the poet. The museum was established in 1992 at the initiative of scholar Kostis Moskof, cultural attaché to the Greek Embassy in Cairo until 1998. After Cavafy’s death in 1933, the apartment turned into a cheap hostel; it was later recontructed with the help of photographs becoming reminiscent of Cavafy&#x27;s time. The Cavafy Museum contains a wide range of bibliographical material; it is home to several of Cavafy&#x27;s sketches and original manuscripts, as well as several pictures and portraits of and by Cavafy. It holds translations of Cavafy’s poetry in 20 languages by 40 different scholars and most of the 3,000 articles and works written about his poetry.

<text>Leoš Janáček Airport Ostrava , formerly &quot;Ostrava-Mošnov International Airport&quot;, is the airport of the city of Ostrava in the Czech Republic, a major economic and industrial centre. It is located to the southwest of the city and also acts as a point of entry to northern Moravia and Czech Silesia. The airport was renamed in December 2006 after the composer Leoš Janáček.

NATO Days in Ostrava, a military air show, has been an event at the airport since 2003.

== History ==
The first passenger airport in Ostrava was Ostrava-Hrabůvka airport that served flights to Prague from 1935 until 1959. The airfield in Mošnov originates from 1959. The Prague route was relocated to the new airport at that year. The airport served as air base for the Czech Air Force until 1989. Beginning in 1989, after the airport was placed under ČSL control, the airport was used by holiday charter operators.

The majority of passenger flights to land in Ostrava were charter flights to Mediterranean destinations in Tunisia, Spain and Bulgaria. The flights were sporadic during the summer months. The airline Air Ostrava (successor to Air Vítkovice) had a base in Ostrava since 1994. Air Ostrava opened routes to Verona, Amsterdam and Ljubljana. The airline collapsed in 2000, leaving the airport without a base carrier.

In 1997, Czech leisure airline Fischer Air owned by the travel and tourism company Fischer commenced a seasonal flights to Antalya, Burgas, Gran Canaria, Heraklion, Hurghada, Ibiza, Mallorca, Monastir, Rhodes, Split and Tenerife until the collapse of the airline in 2005 meant the discontinuation of the routes to Canary Islands.

<text>John Foster Furcolo (July 29, 1911 – July 5, 1995) was an American lawyer, writer, and Democratic Party politician from Massachusetts. He was the state&#x27;s 60th governor, and also represented the state as a member of the United States House of Representatives. He was the first Italian-American governor of the state, and an active promoter of community colleges.

Born in New Haven, Connecticut and educated at Yale, Furcolo practiced law before serving in the United States Navy during World War II. He first won election to Congress in 1948, and served most of two terms, resigning after being appointed Massachusetts Treasurer in 1952 by Governor Paul A. Dever. He won two terms as governor, serving from 1957 to 1961. In addition to supporting community colleges, he also furthered the redevelopment of parts of Boston, supporting development of the Prudential Center and Government Center. His administration was overshadowed by corruption scandals, but no charges against him made it to trial. He was twice an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate. He was the author of several books, including a novel set amid events surrounding the World War II Katyn massacre.

==Early years==
John Foster Furcolo was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 29, 1911. His father, Charles Furcolo, was an Italian immigrant and a doctor, and his mother was an Irish immigrant. Furcolo attended public schools in Longmeadow, Massachusetts and New Haven. He then attended Yale University, where he graduated in 1933, and finally Yale Law School, where he received his LL.B. in 1936. At Yale he played a variety of sports, serving on both the boxing team (as a welterweight) and the baseball team. According to his brother Charles, he played second base. He was undefeated as a boxer and was encouraged to turn professional, but chose not to. He also engaged in literary pursuits, writing short stories and plays that were produced locally. Furcolo dropped use of his first name when he entered politics.

In 1937 Furcolo moved to Springfield, Massachusetts, where he opened a law practice. He specialized in criminal and civil trial work, and quickly rose in prominence, the quality of his legal preparation and trial work receiving favorable notice from others in the legal community. After a few years he moved his growing family to neighboring Longmeadow. He made his first bid for public office in 1942, an unsuccessful run for district attorney. During World War II he served in U.S. Navy as a lieutenant (junior grade) aboard , a transport vessel in the Pacific, which participated in the Invasion of Okinawa.

He was a member of the Indian Orchard Council number 183 of the Knights of Columbus.

==House of Representatives==

In 1946 Furcolo stood for election as a Democratic Party candidate for the 2nd Congressional District seat, running against incumbent Charles R. Clason. He lost by 3,000 votes, a narrow margin, in an election dominated in the state by Republican victories. In 1948, he again ran against Clason, and won by a comfortable margin, buoyed by the support of war veterans and organized labor. In 1950, Furcolo was challenged by Polish-American Republican Charles Skibinski, who sought to capitalize on the large number of Polish-Americans in the district in a campaign in which there were no major issues. Furcolo retained his seat, winning by more than 10,000 out of over 130,000 votes cast.

Furcolo served in the House of Representatives from January 3, 1949, until his resignation on September 30, 1952. He drew national attention when he was the first freshman representative to be invited to the White House by President Harry S. Truman to discuss legislative matters. He innovatively introduced the idea of a &quot;people&#x27;s council&quot;, composed of individuals from a cross-section of his district&#x27;s interests, which he could consult to gauge opinion on legislative matters. His major legislative proposal, introduced early in his first term, was for a scholarship loan program to help needy high school graduates attend college. Furcolo was adopted as a protégé by the powerful majority leader of the house, Massachusetts Congressman John W. McCormack. McCormack engineered Furcolo&#x27;s appointment to the powerful House Appropriations Committee. This appointment rankled John F. Kennedy, elected to the body with Furcolo, and Kennedy later blamed Furcolo for hampering his attempts to gain patronage influence from McCormack.

In 1951 Furcolo was appointed to a special committee established to investigate reports of mass killings of Polish military officers and intelligentsia by the Soviets during World War II in the Katyn Forest. Furcolo&#x27;s appointment to this committee (which was otherwise dominated by Polish-Americans) was also the work of McCormack, likely because of the large Polish-American population in Furcolo&#x27;s district. The committee concluded that the killings had been perpetrated by the Soviet secret service (NKVD), and sought to bring a case before the International Court of Justice. Furcolo used what he learned from the committee&#x27;s investigations to write a novel, &quot;Rendezvous at Katyn&quot;, which is set amid those events.

==Massachusetts Treasurer==
On July 5, 1952, Furcolo was appointed by Governor Paul A. Dever to be the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to replace John E. Hurley, who had resigned to accept a position as clerk of the Boston Municipal Court. Dever made the appointment in part to break up what was seen as Irish-American domination of the government. Congress was in recess at the time of the appointment, so Furcolo did not formally resign his Congressional seat until September. In November 1952, Furcolo was elected in his own right to the Treasurer&#x27;s office despite Dever&#x27;s loss of the governor&#x27;s seat; he held that position until January 1955.

In 1954 Furcolo ran for the U.S. Senate, but was narrowly defeated by incumbent Republican Leverett A. Saltonstall. The election exposed the personal feud between Furcolo and Kennedy to the public. Kennedy refused to make a public endorsement of Furcolo in a televised appearance, and Saltonstall recounted in his memoir that Kennedy&#x27;s campaign staff worked with his in opposition to Furcolo, and that Saltonstall regularly announced legislation he and Kennedy had cosponsored. Furcolo later learned that Kennedy had lent Ted Sorensen, a key member of his staff, to the Saltonstall campaign, and that Kennedy&#x27;s father Joseph had financially supported Saltonstall&#x27;s campaign.

==Massachusetts Governor==
Furcolo ran for Governor of Massachusetts in 1956, easily winning the Democratic party nomination and primary. The campaign against Republican Lieutenant Governor Sumner G. Whittier was vitriolic, with each accusing the other of distorting his legislative record. Furcolo was further characterized by Republicans as a part of the Dever political machine who would be beholden to Boston interests. Senator Kennedy in this election specifically endorsed Furcolo for the office. Furcolo won the election and was re-elected in 1958, easily defeating former Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Charles Gibbons, who was chosen by the Republicans as a write-in candidate after their chosen nominee, Attorney General George Fingold, died two months before the election. Furcolo was governor from 1957 to 1961.

Furcolo was a vigorous and active chief executive, working long hours in the office. He came to the office with large-scale visions and worked hard, sometimes stubbornly and against other party interests, to realize some of them. He was not always seen as a &quot;team player&quot; by members of his own party in the legislature whose backgrounds he did not generally share. This was particularly manifested in his push for a broad-based sales tax, opposition to which had been enshrined in the Democratic Party platform; the proposal went down to bipartisan defeat in the legislature. During his administration, Furcolo established a network of regional community colleges throughout the Commonwealth, and fought for increases in state worker salaries, as well as improvements in workmen&#x27;s compensation and unemployment benefits. He introduced income-tax withholding from payroll checks, leading to a significant increase in state revenue. According to the state&#x27;s 1960 report, it ranked first in the nation in education and at or near the top in other social programs. He also appointed the state&#x27;s youngest state purchasing agent, Bernard &quot;Bunny&quot; Solomon, who saved taxpayers hundreds of thousands annually.

Furcolo was a skeptic on the subject of the death penalty, ordering a study of the institution shortly after taking office, and commuted the death sentences of four men while governor. Legislative moves by the state legislature to ban capital punishment stalled in the house during his tenure.
Furcolo was an influential figure in the development of Boston&#x27;s Government Center area as a nexus of local, federal and state offices. He was the first to propose that a federal office building planned for the Back Bay area of the city instead become part of a major redevelopment effort in the declining Scollay Square neighborhood. The effort was primarily spearheaded by Boston Mayors John B. Hynes and John F. Collins, but Furcolo was a regular presence moving the Government Center proposals forward and supporting them at the state level. Using the pseudonym John Foster, in 1957 Furcolo published a comic novel, &quot;Let George Do It!&quot;, about a campaign for a state legislature seat.

In addition to Government Center, Furcolo was also instrumental in the development of Boston&#x27;s Prudential Center. The site of an unused railyard in the Back Bay had for some years been the subject of development proposals. Prudential Insurance sought limitations on Boston&#x27;s tax assessments on the proposed development, and portions of the site were also being considered for use as an extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Furcolo helped to broker the deal, making it possible for Prudential to begin construction. The Supreme Judicial Court struck down aspects of the deal regarding the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA, now the MBTA), leading to a work stoppage on the project in 1960.

Furcolo&#x27;s administration was marked by the continuing trend of corruption in state government that had been growing in prior administrations. One notable series of cases involved the construction of the parking garage under the Boston Common. Furcolo established the Massachusetts Parking Commission to oversee the effort, but did not place it under any sort of oversight. The commission was self-financed by floating bonds, and a number of actors were later documented to extract more the $800,000 from the commission&#x27;s construction funds by a variety of schemes. Four people were convicted and served prison time for these acts. A second major scandal, involving collusion between state public works officials, appraisers and landowners along planned interstate highway routes, took place in the 1950s. Details of the scams, described by politicians at that time as &quot;the granddaddy&quot; of highway-related malfeasance, were squelched by a Democratic-controlled Congressional investigation until after the 1960 election, apparently to avoid embarrassing Kennedy in his run for president. The scandal resulted in the conviction of several Massachusetts highway officials.

==Second run for Senate==
In 1960 Furcolo again ran for the U.S. Senate, and was widely expected to gain the Democratic Party nomination easily. However, former Springfield mayor Thomas O&#x27;Connor capitalized on the corruption scandals during Furcolo&#x27;s administration and defeated him in the primary. Furcolo attributed his defeat to his support for the sales tax proposal.

During Furcolo&#x27;s lame-duck period, John F. Kennedy resigned his Senate seat in December 1960 after winning the presidential election, putting Furcolo in position to appoint a temporary replacement. He initially sought to appoint himself, but was pressured by the Kennedys to appoint Benjamin Smith (a college roommate of Kennedy&#x27;s brother Joseph) instead. The Kennedys wanted the seat to go to younger brother Edward (as it eventually did in the November 1962 special election), but he was ineligible due to age at the time of the appointment.

==Later years==
Furcolo took the loss badly and decided to leave politics. He returned to private practice, moving to Needham and his law firm to Newton. Four years after leaving office, he was indicted on charges of arranging for a bribe to be paid to members of the Governor&#x27;s Council (while he was still governor) to secure an appointment for a supporter. The indictment against him was eventually dismissed for lack of evidence, but four councilors were convicted on a variety of charges.
In 1966, Furcolo sought the Democratic nomination for Massachusetts attorney general but lost the nomination to former Lieutenant Governor Francis X. Bellotti in September. He worked from 1967 to 1972 as an assistant district attorney for Middlesex County. In 1969, he served on the U.S. Attorney General&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Narcotics.

Furcolo also began teaching law in 1969. Over the next five years he taught legal ethics at Portia Law School (now the New England School of Law), criminal law at Massachusetts Bay Community College, and government at a number of the state&#x27;s community colleges. He was selected as an administrative law judge with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission in 1975, a post he held through 1989.

Furcolo maintained an interest in higher education after his departure from elective politics. While a United States Representative he secured the passage of legislation offering loans to needy students, and while governor he enacted significant reforms in the state&#x27;s university system, granting the individual schools in the system fiscal autonomy. In 1973 he was hired as a full-time professor of public service, working across the entire state college system. He served for many years on the state&#x27;s board of regents, which was responsible for overseeing the state-run institutions of higher learning. In this capacity, he was often a minority voice in seeking to improve the state&#x27;s colleges and universities. Because he was dissatisfied with that body&#x27;s work, in 1981 he supported the formation of an advocacy group to lobby for improvements.

Furcolo died of heart failure at the age of 83 on July 5, 1995, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is buried in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts.

==Family, awards, and legacy==
Furcolo was married three times. His first wife Kay, with whom he had five children, died in 1964. In 1967 he married Lucy Carra, who also served as a federal administrative law judge; they had no children. Estranged from Lucy in 1972, he became embroiled in legal disputes with her relatives after her death in 1979. In 1980, Furcolo married Constance M. Gleason, who survived him.

In 2009 Furcolo&#x27;s support of community colleges was commemorated when the state formally named its network the Governor Foster Furcolo Community College System. He was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta by the government of Poland for his role in the investigation of Katyn, and he also received the Italian Star of Solidarity. He was awarded honorary degrees from Boston University, Portia Law School, Suffolk University, the University of Massachusetts, and a number of other schools.

==Publications==
In addition to books, Furcolo wrote articles, stories and essays for a wide variety of publications. His books include:

<text>Matthew Haughey (born October 10, 1972) is an American programmer, web designer, and . He is best known as the founder of the community weblog MetaFilter, where he is called &quot;mathowie&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Haughey grew up in Placentia, California. He graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a B.S. and M.S. in environmental science.

Haughey designed his first website in 1995. From 1997 to 2000, he was a webmaster and programmer for Social Sciences Computing at UCLA. He moved to the San Francisco Bay area in 2000s, worked as an employee of Pyra Labs, and participated in the development of early versions of Blogger. In 2001, he worked briefly for KnowNow and Bitzi. Life led him to relocate to Portland, Oregon, where he served as creative director at Creative Commons from 2002 to 2005.

In 1999, Haughey launched MetaFilter, a community weblog and internet forum, which he programmed his own using Macromedia ColdFusion and Microsoft SQL Server. In March 2015, he announced his stepping down from daily management of Metafilter and take on a new role as Senior Content Director at Slack. He left the primary management and operation duties of Metafilter to long-time moderator Josh Millard. In July 2017, the ownership was transferred from Metafilter to Millard.

Haughey was featured on the front cover of the May 2001 issue of Brill&#x27;s Content, illustrating the cover story entitled &quot;Human Portals&quot;. MetaFilter was a project he started when there were only &quot;30 or so&quot; blogs, and he felt that finding &quot;one or two links a day&quot; personally was not enough content. He concluded that a blog with four or five people could do better. He had to contribute many of the early posts until &quot;a few hundred people showed up and we had something good.&quot; MetaFilter has since been described as &quot;one of the web&#x27;s most successful communities&quot;. Haughey credits the site&#x27;s &quot;strong sense of community&quot; for its success, unlike websites that offer social incentives such as karma.

Haughey has a personal weblog called &quot;A Whole Lotta Nothing&quot; and a photoblog titled &quot;Ten Years of My Life&quot;, in which he records daily photographs, many of himself. &quot;Ten Years&quot; was named 3rd-best photo blog by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2004. On his personal blog, he was noted for starting an internet meme when he annotated Google Maps images of his hometown. He has helped build MetaFilter workalikes such as SportsFilter and helped instigate the5k.org.

Haughey has also ventured into niche blogging; his PVRBlog (personal video recorder blog), which he started in 2004, gained attention as the site that first published complaints over copyright protection on TiVo systems. It was also recognized as an early adopter of Google AdSense text advertising, which according to Haughey allowed him to make enough income to cover his mortgage. In December 2009, Haughey auctioned off PVRBlog on eBay. He had guessed that the site would sell for about $8,500. But after heavy bidding, it was eventually sold for $12,110 to brightfire.net of Austin, TX.

Haughey has been a technical editor of several programming books, and has also contributed chapters to non-technical books in topic areas such as blogging and online community. Since 2005, Haughey has written a number of pieces for &quot;The New York Times&quot; CIRCUITS section.

In April 2007, Haughey launched the blog Fortuito.us in order to share his thoughts about supporting himself and his family through online projects.

On November 12, 2009 Haughey posted to Twitter, &quot;I passed out at home had a seizure, went to ER, did a cat scan and they found a growth. Awaiting surgery in the next week to remove it.&quot; Within hours, thousands of people responded with well wishes. Surgery was planned for the following day, but postponed at the last minute. On December 29, 2009, Haughey announced that hormone therapy had shrunk the tumor to less than 50% its original size, and that prospects looked good for the tumor to shrink until &quot;nearly disappearing&quot;.

Haughey lives in McMinnville, Oregon with his wife Kay and their daughter Fiona (who has also been the subject of a photoblog, Fiona.haughey.com).

<text>Horace Howard Furness (November 2, 1833 – August 13, 1912) was an American Shakespearean scholar of the 19th century.

==Life and career==

Horace Furness was the son of the Unitarian minister and abolitionist William Henry Furness (1802–1896), and brother of the architect Frank Furness (1839–1912). He graduated from Harvard University in 1854, embarked on a journey to Europe with Atherton Blight, and then studied in Germany. After returning to the United States, he was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar in 1858, but his growing deafness interfered with the practice of law.

In 1860, he joined the Shakspere Society of Philadelphia, an amateur study group that took its scholarship seriously. As he later wrote:
As editor of the &quot;New Variorum&quot; editions of Shakespeare—also called the &quot;Furness Variorum&quot;—he collected in a single source 300 years of references, antecedent works, influences and commentaries. He devoted more than forty years to the series, completing the annotation of sixteen plays. His son, Horace Howard Furness, Jr. (1865–1930), joined as co-editor of the Variorum&#x27;s later volumes, and continued the project after the father&#x27;s death, annotating three additional plays and revising two others.

He was a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, a long-serving trustee (1880–1904), and chairman of the building committee for its library. Designed by his brother Frank, Horace selected the Shakepearean quotes for the 1891 building&#x27;s leaded glass windows. He was the advisor for doctoral student Emily Jordan Folger who, with her husband Henry Clay Folger, would co-found the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC.

An 1890 review in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; may indicate the esteem in which British critics held Furness&#x27;s scholarship:
He died on August 13, 1912, and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Personal==

In 1860 Furness married Helen Kate Rogers (1837–1883), heir to an ironmaking fortune and sister of University of Pennsylvania instructor Fairman Rogers. She compiled a concordance to Shakespeare&#x27;s poems, published in 1874. They had four children: 
* Walter Rogers Furness (1861–February 7, 1914), an architect, who in 1896 became a partner in the firm of his uncle, Frank Furness. He built Furness Cottage at the Jekyll Island Club, Georgia, where his family vacationed from 1889 to 1895. He was permanently blinded in one eye in 1898, after a ball hit him during a game of racquets. From then on his life became worse and worse, descending into raging alcoholism. His wife, Helen Key Bullitt, died at age 47 in January 1914, and he died a month later at age 53, following a heart attack.
* Horace Howard Furness Jr. (1865–1930), who continued his father&#x27;s work on the New Variorum project. Author of a play, &quot;The Gloss of Youth : an imaginary episode in the lives of William Shakespeare and John Fletcher&quot; (1920). 
* William Henry Furness III, (1866-1920), an explorer and ethnologist. One of the University of Pennsylvania medical students depicted in Thomas Eakins&#x27;s painting The Agnew Clinic (1889). Undertook anthropological expeditions to the South Pacific with Hiram M. Hiller, Jr. and Alfred C. Harrison, Jr., and wrote books and articles about Borneo and Polynesia. Died unmarried.
* Caroline Augusta Furness (1873-1909), also an ethnologist, she married University of Pennsylvania instructor Horace Jayne, and died from a heart attack at age 35 in 1909. Their children were Kate Furness Jayne and Horace H. F. Jayne, an art historian and museum director.

Horace and Kate Furness inherited her family&#x27;s Philadelphia city house, at the SW corner of Locust Street &amp; West Washington Square. Frank Furness altered the house in 1873, and designed the 1909 office building that replaced it. He also designed their country house, &quot;Lindenshade&quot; (, demolished 1940) and its many expansions, including the 1903 fireproof brick library.

==Legacy==
*Horace Howard Furness High School in South Philadelphia is named for him.
*Horace Jr. donated his father&#x27;s Shakespearean collection to the University of Pennsylvania, whose Horace Howard Furness Memorial Library honors both father and son.
*William Henry Furness III donated the land for the Helen Kate Furness Free Library in Wallingford, Pennsylvania, built in 1916 on the former grounds of his parents&#x27; country house, &quot;Lindenshade.&quot;

<text>The Green Party, also known as the Green Party UK, was a Green political party in the United Kingdom.

Prior to 1985; it was called the Ecology Party; before that, it was also named PEOPLE. In 1990, it separated into three regional political parties within the United Kingdom:
* the Green Party of England and Wales
* the Scottish Greens
* the Green Party Northern Ireland

Despite the UK Green Party no longer existing as a unified entity, &quot;Green Party&quot; (singular) is still used colloquially to refer collectively to the three separate parties; for example, in the reporting of opinion polls and election results.

== History ==

===PEOPLE, 1972–1975===

The Green Party&#x27;s origins go back to PEOPLE, a political party founded in Coventry in November 1972. An interview with overpopulation expert Paul R. Ehrlich in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine inspired a small group of professional and business people to form the &#x27;Thirteen Club&#x27;, so named because it first met on 13 September 1972 at the Napton Bridge pub in Napton-on-the-Hill near Daventry. This included surveyors and property agents Freda Sanders and Michael Benfield, and husband-and-wife solicitors Lesley and Tony Whittaker (a former Kenilworth councillor for the Conservative Party), all with practices in Coventry. Out of the original &#x27;club&#x27; these four individuals launched &#x27;PEOPLE&#x27; as a new political party to challenge the UK political establishment. They called its first public meeting on 22 February 1973 at their office at 69 Hertford Street in Coventry. Its policy concerns published in 1973 included economics, employment, defence, energy and fuel supplies, land tenure, pollution and social security, all set within an ecological perspective. &quot;Zero growth&quot; (or &quot;steady state&quot;) economics were a strong feature in the party&#x27;s philosophical basis.

Later recognised as the first Green party in the United Kingdom and Europe as a whole, the party published the &#x27;Manifesto for Survival&#x27; in June 1974, between the two general elections of that year. The manifesto was inspired by &quot;A Blueprint for Survival&quot; published by &quot;The Ecologist&quot; magazine. &#x27;A Manifesto for a Sustainable Society&#x27; was an expanded statement of policies published in 1975 published under the newly changed name of the Ecology Party. The editor of &quot;The Ecologist&quot;, Edward &#x27;Teddy&#x27; Goldsmith, merged his &#x27;Movement for Survival&#x27; with PEOPLE in 1974. Goldsmith became one of the leading members of the new party during the 1970s.

With &quot;Steady State&quot; economics featured in the party&#x27;s philosophical basis, the all-UK party became a persistent and growing presence in general elections and European elections, often fielding enough candidates to qualify for television and radio election broadcasts.

Membership rose and the party contested both 1974 general elections. In the February 1974 general election, PEOPLE received 4,576 votes in 7 seats. In later years, an influx of left-wing activists took PEOPLE in a more left-wing direction, causing something of a split. In the October 1974 general election, where PEOPLE&#x27;s average vote fell to just 0.7%; much of the difference was made by Liberal candidates entering the fray. After much internal debate the party&#x27;s 1975 Conference adopted a proposal to change its name to &#x27;The Ecology Party&#x27; in order to gain more recognition as the party of environmental concern. This was supported by the Executive, who had found media recognition hard to achieve under the original name. &#x27;Green&#x27; was not an appropriate name at that time and &#x27;ecology&#x27; had become more publicly recognised as a concept in the party&#x27;s three years of campaigning.

===1975 conference===
After much debate, the party&#x27;s 1975 conference adopted a proposal to change its name to the &quot;Ecology Party&quot; to gain more recognition as the party of environmental concern.

Party co-founder Tony Whittaker noted in an interview with Derek Wall &#x27;… voters did not connect PEOPLE with ecology. What I wanted was something that the media could look up in their files so that, when they wanted a spokesman of the issue of ecology, they could find the Ecology Party and pick up the phone. It was as brutal and basic as that. PEOPLE didn&#x27;t communicate what we had hoped it would communicate&#x27;.

Derek Wall, in his history of the Green Party, contends that the new political movement focused initially on the theme of survival, which shaped the &quot;bleak evolution&quot; of the nascent ecological party during the 1970s. Furthermore, the effect of the &quot;revolution of values&quot; during the 1960s would come later. In Wall&#x27;s eyes, the party suffered from a lack of media attention and &quot;opposition from many environmentalists&quot;, which contrasted the experience of other emerging Green parties, such as Germany&#x27;s &quot;Die Grünen&quot;. Nonetheless, PEOPLE invested much of its resources in engaging with the indifferent environmental movement, which Wall calls a &quot;tactical mistake&quot;.

===The Ecology Party, 1975–1985===

The party won its first representation in 1976, when John Luck took a seat on Rother District Council in East Sussex, and party Campaign Secretary John Davenport won a parish council seat in Kempsey.

Jonathan Tyler was elected Chairman of the party in 1976, and Jonathon Porritt became a prominent member. At the 1977 Party Conference in Birmingham, the party&#x27;s first constitution was ratified and Jonathon Porritt was elected to the Ecology Party National Executive Committee (NEC). Porritt would become the party&#x27;s most significant public figure, working, with David Fleming, &quot;to provide the Party with an attractive image and effective organisation&quot;.

With Porritt gaining increasing prominence and an election manifesto called &quot;The Real Alternative&quot;, the Ecology Party fielded 53 candidates in the 1979 general election, entitling them to radio and television election broadcasts. Though many considered this a gamble, the plan, encouraged by Porritt, worked, as the party received 39,918 votes (an average of 1.5%) and membership jumped tenfold from around 500 to 5,000 or more. This, Derek Wall notes, meant that the Ecology Party &quot;became the fourth party in UK politics, ahead of the National Front and Socialist Unity&quot;.

Following this electoral success, the party introduced Annual Spring Conferences to accompany Autumn Conferences, and a process of building up a large compendium of policies began, culminated in today&#x27;s &quot;Policies for a Sustainable Society&quot; (which encompasses around 124 520 words). At the same time, according to Wall, &quot;the Post-1968 generation&quot; began to join the party, advocating non-violent direct action as an important element of the Ecology Party vision outside of electoral politics. This manifested itself in an apparent &quot;decentralist faction&quot; who gained ground within the party, leading to the Party Conference stripping the Executive of powers and rejecting the election of a single leader. The new generation was in evidence in the first &#x27;Summer Green Gathering&#x27; in July 1980, the action of the Ecology Party CND (later Green CND), and the Greenham Common camp. The party also became increasingly feminist.

===1983 general election===
Due to the recession causing the marginalisation of Green issues, Roy Jenkins leaving the Labour Party to form the Social Democratic Party in 1981, and the inability of the Party to absorb the rapid increase in membership, the early-1980s were extremely tough for the Ecology Party. Nonetheless, the Party prepared for the 1983 general election, inspired by the success of Die Grünen in Germany. At the 1983 general election, the Ecology Party stood over 100 candidates and gained 54,299 votes.

===Name change and internal strife, 1985–1986===

The UK experienced a great deal of political change in 1985. After the formation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), there were noises being made that the UK needed a &quot;green&quot; party. In response to the rumours that a group of Liberal Party activists were about to launch a UK &#x27;Green Party&#x27;, HELP (the Hackney Local Ecology Party) registered the name &quot;The Green Party,&quot; with a green circle, designed by Steve O’Brien, as its logo. The first public meeting, chaired by David Fitzpatrick (then an Ecology Party speaker), was 13 June 1985 in Hackney Town Hall. Paul Ekins (then co-chair of the Ecology Party) spoke on the subject of Green politics and the inner city. Hackney Green Party put a formal proposal to the Ecology Party Autumn Conference in Dover that year to change to the Green Party, which was supported by the majority of attendees, including John Abineri, formerly an actor in the BBC series &quot;Survivors&quot; who supported adding &quot;Green&quot; to the name to fall in line with other environmental parties in Europe.

The next year, an internal dispute arose within the party. A faction calling itself the &quot;Party Organisation Working Group (POWG)&quot; proposed constitutional amendments designed to create a streamlined, two-tier structure to govern the internal workings of the party. Decentralists voted these proposals down. Paul Ekins and Jonathan Tyler, prominent party activists and leading members of POWG, then formed a semi-covert group called &quot;Maingreen,&quot; whose private comments, upon becoming public knowledge, suggested to many that they wished to take control of the party. Tyler and Ekins resigned and left the party but Derek Wall describes how the &quot;wounds&quot; left by the &#x27;Maingreen Affair&#x27; lingered on in the heated internal debates of the late 1980s.

===1987 general election===
Meanwhile, the party gained ground electorally. The 1987 general election saw the 133 Greens standing for office take 89,753 votes (1.3% on average), an improvement on 1983. The next two years would see growing membership and increasing media attention. This coincided with greater concern over the environment following the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and concern over CFCs.

===Campaign success, 1989===
The party enjoyed further success. Its Campaign for Real Democracy&#x27; launched by the party allowed it to play a part in the Anti-Poll Tax Campaign. The party&#x27;s biggest success came at the 1989 European elections, where the Green Party won 2,292,695 votes and received 15% of the overall vote. European elections in Great Britain were then run on a first-past-the-post basis, whilst the three seats in Northern Ireland were elected by single transferable vote, and the party failed to gain any seats.

According to Derek Wall, the party would have gained 12 seats if they had been running in other European countries who employed Proportional Representation. Wall explains this &quot;breakthrough&quot; as a combination of the declining popularity of Margaret Thatcher, the reaction to the Poll Tax, Conservative opposition to the European Union, ineffective Labour Party and Liberal Democrat campaigns and a well-prepared Green Party campaign. That environmental issues were very prominent in UK politics at the time should also be added to this list. At no time before or since have Green issues been so high on the minds of UK voters as a voting issue.

As a result of this success, Sara Parkin and David Icke rose to prominence in the UK media, soon becoming two of the four Principal Speakers, a position created in lieu of a leader. Parkin especially was in demand as a Green spokesperson. However, the new media attention was not always handled well by the party as a whole. In the run up to the 1989 party conference, it attracted criticism for advocating policies aiming to reduce the total population, proposals which were subsequently rejected. Further controversies included Derek Wall&#x27;s rejection of possible alliances to establish PR. Icke too attracted criticism soon after writing his second book in 1989, an outline of his views on the environment.

Mainstream political parties were, however, alarmed by the Greens&#x27; electoral performance and adopted some &#x27;Green policies&#x27; in an attempt to counter the threat. In this period, the Green Party had representation in the House of Lords in the person of George MacLeod, Baron MacLeod of Fuinary, who died in 1991. He was the first British Green parliamentarian.

===The breakup of the party, 1990===

In 1990, the Scottish and Northern Ireland wings of the Green Party in the United Kingdom decided to separate amicably from the party in England and Wales, to form the Scottish Greens and the Green Party Northern Ireland. The Wales Green Party became an autonomous regional party and remained within the new Green Party of England and Wales.

===General elections===
===February 1974===
The party stood six candidates in the February 1974 General Election. They received a total of 4,576. The party lost all of its deposits by failing to win 12.5% of the votes cast, namely a total of £900 (). Lesley Whittaker and Edward Goldsmith were two of the six who stood in the election.

===October 1974===
Membership rose and the party stood five candidates in the October General Election; it cost the party £750. This affected preparations for that election, when PEOPLE&#x27;s average vote fell to just 0.7%.

<text>Johann Michael Adolf Furtwängler (30 June 1853 – 10 October 1907) was a German archaeologist, teacher, art historian and museum director. He was the father of the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler and grandfather of the German archaeologist Andreas Furtwängler.

==Early life==
Furtwängler was born at Freiburg im Breisgau, where his father was a classical scholar and schoolteacher; he was educated there, at Leipzig and at Munich, where he was a pupil of Heinrich Brunn, whose comparative method in art criticism he much developed.

==Career==
After studying at the University of Leipzig, with Johannes Overbeck, and having graduated from Freiburg (1874), with a dissertation, &quot;Eros in der Vasenmalerei&quot;, he spent the academic years 1876-1878 supported by a scholarship at the German Archaeological Institute, studying in Italy and Greece. In 1878, he participated in Ernst Curtius’ excavations at Olympia.

In 1879, he published with Georg Loeschcke &quot;Mykenische Thongefäβe&quot;, a complete publication of the Mycenaean pottery finds on Aegina. This not only provided a valuable chronology but also represented the first corpus of pottery finds in archaeology. The study was the first to distinguish between Mycenaean and Geometric styles in pottery, and contributed to the developing technique of identifying archaeological strata, and giving them relative dates, through the painting styles represented on pottery sherds, which previously had been discarded as spoil. By noting the recurrence of similar vases within a variety of strata Furtwangler was able to use these sherds as a tool for dating sites.

On the strength of this, Furtwängler received double appointments the following year (1880) as assistant director at the Royal Museums of Berlin (&quot;Königliche Museen zu Berlin&quot;) and as a &quot;privatdozent&quot; at the University of Berlin. In later years Furtwängler concluded he had dedicated his best years to the museum. His catalogue of the Saburov collection (1883–87) demonstrated his mastery of classical terracottas.
In 1885 he married Adelheid Wendt. The same year, his catalogue of the Greek pottery of the Antikensammlung Berlin, &quot;Beschreibung der Vasensammlung im Antiquarium&quot; (2 vols.) was published. His book on Greek sculpture, &quot;Meisterwerke der griechischen Plastik&quot; (1893) made his name familiar to a wider audience; an English translation &quot;Masterpieces of Greek Sculpture&quot;, translated by Eugénie Sellers Strong, appeared in 1895. Through connoisseurship he refined identifications of the Greek sculptors responsible for the originals of many works known only through Roman copies; many of his attributions still stand, though the most recent scholarship in the field has moved away from assigning sculptors&#x27; names to masterpieces. His 1891 reconstructions of the Lemnian Athena by Phidias were celebrated but have subsequently occasioned dispute; they may be found in the Dresden Albertinum.

In 1894, he left Berlin to succeed his early mentor, Heinrich von Brunn, as professor of classical archaeology in Munich, where he was also Director of the Munich Glyptothek. In 1896 in his book &quot;Beschreibung der geschnittenen Steine im Antiquarium&quot;, Furtwängler excluded from his own catalogues of engraved stones in Berlin those engraved gems that were associated with magic, as their artistic value was considered by him not important. For this reason, he was convinced that these types of engraved stones should also be removed from the display of the collection in the Department of Egyptology.

Furtwängler published a study on Greek engraved gems and their inscriptions &quot;Die Antiken Gemmen&quot; (1900). With Karl W. Reichhold he initiated the corpus of Greek vases, &quot;Griechische Vasenmalerei&quot; in 1904, issued in fascicles. After Furtwängler&#x27;s death, Friedrich Hauser assumed editorship; a third volume of Furtwängler&#x27;s &quot;Griechische Vasenmalerei&quot; was published in 1932.

In the field, he renewed the excavations at the temple of Aphaia in Aegina, southwest of Athens; the work resulted in a monograph of the site (1906), but the following year resulted in the dysentery contracted at the site from which he died (October 10, 1907), in the full maturity of his career. He was buried in Athens. His grave is located at the First Cemetery of Athens.

==Assessment and legacy==
Furtwängler was a prolific writer, with a prodigious knowledge and memory, and a most ingenious and confident critic; and his work not only dominated the field of archaeological criticism but also raised its standing both at home and abroad.

Among his numerous publications the most important were a volume on the bronzes found at Olympia, vast works on ancient gems and Greek vases, and the invaluable &quot;Meisterwerke der griechischen Plastik&quot; (&quot;Masterpieces of Greek Sculpture&quot;) (1893 and 1908; English translations by Eugenie Strong and Taylor, London, 1914).

Furtwängler&#x27;s students formed an outstanding group among the next generation of classical art historians and archaeologists, and his published research was of even wider influence.

<text>Vitaly Vasilyevich Fedorchuk (; ; 27 December 1918 – 29 February 2008) was a Ukrainian Soviet security and intelligence officer and politician who served as Chairman of the Committee for State Security of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic from 1970 to 1982 and then Minister of Internal Affairs from 1982 to 1986.

==Early life and education==
Born in 1918 to a poor Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Ogievka, located in the Zhitomir region of Ukraine, Fedorchuk started working at a local newspaper at the age of 16.
 He was called up for military service in 1936 and graduated from the Military Signals and Communications School in Kyiv. Initially a signals officer in the Red Army, in 1939 he was recruited by the NKVD as a full-time operative.

==Security and intelligence officer==
At the beginning of his career as a state security officer, Fedorchuk was assigned to the Mongolia, where he fought in the victorious Battle of Khalkhin Gol against the Japanese Army. He then served as special assistant to the operational commissar of the Special Department of the NKVD of the Urals Military District. After the start of the Great Patriotic War, he became deputy chief of the Special Department of the NKVD attached to the 82nd Motorized Rifle Division of the Red Army and then, from 1942 to 1943, he was chief of the Special Department of the NKVD attached to the Armor Brigades on the North Caucasus Front. Between 1943 and 1949 he served as deputy chief of military counterintelligence (SMERSH) in Yaroslavl.

In 1949 he was assigned as a military counterintelligence officer on the Central Group of Forces in Soviet-occupied Austria. Then he worked in East Germany and again in Austria (since 1955 free from military occupation), in the Soviet Embassy in Vienna, until 1967, under diplomatic cover. In 1967, he was appointed Director of the Third Directorate (military counterintelligence) of the KGB where he served until 1970.

For a period of 12 years, between 18 July 1970 and 26 May 1982, Fedorchuk served as Chairman of the Ukrainian KGB, serving under First Secretary Volodymyr Shcherbystky. In this capacity, he led a fierce suppression of Ukrainian nationalism. The Ukrainian human rights activist Viacheslav Chornovil was twice arrested and sentenced to long terms in prison during Fedorchuk&#x27;s tenure. 

He was appointed Chairman of the KGB on 26 May 1982, replacing Yuri Andropov, and served for seven months until 17 December 1982. When he was appointed, many KGB officials did not have uniforms, and wore civilian clothes at work. Fedorchuk ruled that they must all have three uniforms: one for everyday, one for work outside the office, and one for parades and festivals. 

He then became the Soviet Interior Minister in December 1982, replacing Brezhnev&#x27;s man Nikolai Shchelokov, who had been dismissed on corruption charges as part of Andropov&#x27;s purge of his predecessor&#x27;s associates. His term ended in January 1986 (Mikhail Gorbachev had him replaced due to his opposition to the policies of the new Soviet leadership) and he was succeeded by Alexander V. Vlasov. After leaving the Interior Ministry, Fedorchuk became an Inspector at the Ministry of Defense, a largely honorary post, and then, he retired.

==Death and burial==
Fedorchuk died in Moscow on 29 February 2008 at the age of 89. His body was buried at Moscow&#x27;s Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.

<doc id="729974" wikidata="Q960081" url="?curid=729974" title="Kenneth Burke">
<text>Kenneth Duva Burke (May 5, 1897 – November 19, 1993) was an American literary theorist, as well as poet, essayist, and novelist, who wrote on 20th-century philosophy, aesthetics, criticism, and rhetorical theory. As a literary theorist, Burke was best known for his analyses based on the nature of knowledge. Further, he was one of the first individuals to stray from more traditional rhetoric and view literature as &quot;symbolic action.&quot;

Burke was unorthodox, concerning himself not only with literary texts, but also with the elements of the text that interacted with the audience: social, historical, political background, author biography, etc.

For his career, Burke has been praised by &quot;The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism&quot; as &quot;one of the most unorthodox, challenging, theoretically sophisticated American-born literary critics of the twentieth century.&quot; His work continues to be discussed by rhetoricians and philosophers.

==Personal history==
Kenneth Duva Burke was born on May 5, 1897 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Peabody High School, where he befriended classmates Malcolm Cowley and James Light. He attended Ohio State University to pursue courses in French, German, Greek, and Latin. He moved with his parents to Weehawken, New Jersey and later he enrolled at Columbia University. During his time there, he was a member of the Boar&#x27;s Head Society. The constraining learning environment, however, impelled Burke to leave Columbia, never receiving a college diploma. In Greenwich Village, he kept company with avant-garde writers such as Hart Crane, Malcolm Cowley, Gorham Munson, and later Allen Tate. Raised by a Christian Science mother, Burke later became an avowed agnostic.

In 1919, he married Lily Mary Batterham, with whom he had three daughters: the late feminist, Marxist anthropologist Eleanor Leacock (1922–1987); musician (Jeanne) Elspeth Chapin Hart (1920-2015); and writer and poet France Burke (born c. 1925). He later divorced Lily and, in 1933, married her sister Elizabeth Batterham, with whom he had two sons, Michael and Anthony. Burke served as the editor of the modernist literary magazine &quot;The Dial&quot; in 1923, and as its music critic from 1927 to 1929. Kenneth himself was an avid player of the piano. He received the Dial Award in 1928 for distinguished service to American literature. He was the music critic of &quot;The Nation&quot; from 1934 to 1936, and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935.

His work on criticism was a driving force for placing him back into the university spotlight. As a result, he was able to teach and lecture at various colleges, including Bennington College, while continuing his literary work. Many of Burke&#x27;s personal papers and correspondence are housed at Pennsylvania State University&#x27;s Special Collections Library. However, despite his stint lecturing at universities, Burke was an autodidact and a self-taught scholar.

In later life, his New Jersey farm was a popular summer retreat for his extended family, as reported by his grandson Harry Chapin, a popular singer-songwriter. Burke died of heart failure at his home in Andover, New Jersey, age 96.

==Persuasions and influences==
Burke, like many twentieth-century theorists and critics, was heavily influenced by the ideas of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and Friedrich Nietzsche. He was a lifelong interpreter of Shakespeare and was also significantly influenced by Thorstein Veblen. He resisted being pigeonholed as a follower of any philosophical or political school of thought, and had a notable and very public break with the Marxists who dominated the literary criticism set in the 1930s.

Burke corresponded with a number of literary critics, thinkers, and writers over the years, including William Carlos Williams, Malcolm Cowley, Robert Penn Warren, Allen Tate, Ralph Ellison, Albert Murray, Katherine Anne Porter, Jean Toomer, Hart Crane, and Marianne Moore. Later thinkers who have acknowledged Burke&#x27;s influence include Harold Bloom, Stanley Cavell, J. Hillis Miller, Susan Sontag (his student at the University of Chicago), Erving Goffman, Geoffrey Hartman, Edward Said, René Girard, Fredric Jameson, Michael Calvin McGee, Dell Hymes and Clifford Geertz. Burke was one of the first prominent American critics to appreciate and articulate the importance of Thomas Mann and André Gide; Burke produced the first English translation of &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, which first appeared in &quot;The Dial&quot; in 1924. It is now considered to be much more faithful and explicit than H. T. Lowe-Porter&#x27;s more famous 1930 translation.

Burke&#x27;s political engagement is evident—&quot;A Grammar of Motives&quot; takes as its epigraph, &quot;ad bellum purificandum&quot; (toward the purification of war).

American literary critic Harold Bloom singled out Burke&#x27;s &quot;Counterstatement&quot; and &quot;A Rhetoric of Motives&quot; for inclusion in his book &quot;The Western Canon&quot;.

Beyond his contemporary influences, Burke took Aristotle&#x27;s teachings into account while developing his theories on rhetoric. A significant source of his ideas is Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot;. Drawing from this work, Burke oriented his writing about language specifically to its social context. Similarly, he studied language as involving more than logical discourse and grammatical structure because he recognized that the social context of language cannot be reduced to principles of pure reason.

Burke draws a line between a Platonic and a more contemporary view of rhetoric, described as &quot;old rhetoric&quot; and &quot;new rhetoric&quot; respectively. The former is defined by persuasion by any means, while the latter is concerned with &quot;identification.&quot; In Burke&#x27;s use of the word identification he is describing the process by which the speaker associates herself/himself with certain groups, such as a target audience. 
His idea of &quot;identification&quot; is similar to ethos of classical rhetoric, but it also explains the use of logos and pathos in an effort to create a lasting impression on the auditors. It is characterized by &quot;identifying&quot; with a speaker&#x27;s rhetoric insofar as their words represent a world that seems to be that in which we live. This theory differs from ethos most significantly in Burke&#x27;s conception of artistic communication that he believes is defined by eloquence, which is &quot;simply the end of art and therefore its essence.&quot; The use of rhetoric conveys aesthetic and social competence which is why a text can rarely be reduced to purely scientific or political implications, according to Burke. Rhetoric forms our social identity by a series of events usually based on linguistics, but more generally by the use of any symbolic figures. He uses the metaphor of a drama to articulate this point, where interdependent characters speak and communicate with each other while allowing the others to do the same. Also, Burke describes identification as a function of persuasive appeal.

Burke defined rhetoric as the &quot;use of words by human agents to form attitudes or to induce actions in other human agents.&quot; His definition builds on the preexisting ideas of how people understand the meaning of rhetoric. Burke describes rhetoric as using words to move people or encourage action. Furthermore, he described rhetoric as being almost synonymous with persuasion (&quot;A Rhetoric of Motives&quot;, 1950). Burke argued that rhetoric works to bring about change in people. This change can be evident through attitude, motives or intentions as Burke stated but it can also be physical. Calling for help is an act of rhetoric. Rhetoric is symbolic action that calls people to physical action. Ultimately, rhetoric and persuasion become interchangeable words according to Burke. Other scholars have similar definitions of rhetoric. Aristotle argued that rhetoric was a tool for persuading people (but also for gaining information). He stated that rhetoric had the power to persuade people if the speaker knew how. One way in which Aristotle formed his arguments was through syllogism. Another example of how rhetoric was used to persuade was deliberative discourse. Here, politicians and lawyers used speech to pass or reject policies. Sally Gearhart states that rhetoric uses persuasion to induce change. Although she argues that persuasion is violent and harmful, she uses it as a tool herself to bring about change.

==Philosophy==
The political and social power of &quot;symbols&quot; was central to Burke&#x27;s scholarship throughout his career. He felt that through understanding &quot;what is involved when we say what people are doing and why they are doing it&quot;, we could gain insight into the cognitive basis for our perception of the world. For Burke, the way in which we decide to narrate gives importance to specific qualities over others. He believed that this could tell us a great deal about how we see the world.

===Dramatism===
Burke called the social and political rhetorical analysis &quot;dramatism&quot; and believed that such an approach to language analysis and language usage could help us understand the basis of conflict, the virtues and dangers of cooperation, and the opportunities of identification and consubstantiality.

Burke defined the rhetorical function of language as &quot;a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols.&quot; His definition of humanity states that &quot;man&quot; is &quot;the symbol using, making, and mis-using animal, inventor of the negative, separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making, goaded by the spirit of hierarchy, and rotten with perfection.&quot; For Burke, some of the most significant problems in human behavior resulted from instances of symbols using human beings rather than human beings using symbols.

Burke proposed that when we attribute motives to others, we tend to rely on ratios between five elements: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. This has become known as the dramatistic pentad. The pentad is grounded in his dramatistic method, which considers human communication as a form of action. Dramatism &quot;invites one to consider the matter of motives in a perspective that, being developed from the analysis of drama, treats language and thought primarily as modes of action&quot; (&quot;Grammar of Motives&quot;, xxii). Burke pursued literary criticism not as a formalistic enterprise but rather as an enterprise with significant sociological impact; he saw literature as &quot;equipment for living,&quot; offering folk wisdom and common sense to people and thus guiding the way they lived their lives.

===Rebirth cycle===
Through the use of dramatism, one can ultimately utilize Burke&#x27;s Rebirth Cycle. This cycle encompasses three distinct phases, which include: Guilt/Pollution, Purification, and Redemption. Burke introduced the phases and their functionality through the use of a poem. The poem follows, 
&quot;Here are the steps
In the Iron Law of History That welds Order and Sacrifice 
Order leads to Guilt
(For who can keep commandments!) Guilt needs Redemption
(for who would not be cleaned!) Redemption needs Redeemer (which is to say, a Victim!) 
Order
Through Guilt
To Victimage
(hence: Cult of the Kill)...&quot; (p. 4-5) 
Burke&#x27;s poem provides a basis of for the interactions of the three phases. Order&#x27;s introduction into the life of human enables the creation of guilt. In order to alleviate the results produced by the creation of Guilt, redemption is necessitated. Through the abstraction of redemption, Burke leads to the completion of the cycle.

Pollution initially constitutes actions taken by an individual that result in the creation of Guilt. The creation of Guilt occurs upon the rejection of a hierarchy. Challenges to relationships, changes in power, and appropriateness of behaviors to change are each contributing factors toward the formation of Guilt. It is appropriate to draw parallels between the creation of Guilt, and the concept of original sin. Original sin constitutes &quot;an offense that cannot be avoided or a condition in which all people share&quot;. Guilt represents the initial action that strips a situation of its perceived purity. The establishment of Guilt necessarily leads to the need to undergo purification to cleanse the individual affected by its recognition. Purification is thus accomplished through two forms of &quot;ritual purification.&quot; Mortification and victimage represent the available avenues of purification.

Stratification within society created by hierarchies allows for marginalization within societies. Marginalization thus is a leading factor in the creation of Guilt, and leads to the need for mortification. Burke stated, &quot;In an emphatic way, mortification is the exercising of oneself in &#x27;virtue&#x27;; it is a systematic way of saying no to Disorder, or obediently saying yes to Order&quot;. Mortification allows an individual&#x27;s self-sacrifice which consequently enables them to rid themselves of impurities. Purification will only be reached if it is equal to an individual&#x27;s degree of guilt. If mortification cannot be reached, individuals will ultimately be forced to project, &quot;his conflict upon a scapegoat, by &#x27;passing the buck,&#x27; by seeking a sacrificial vessel upon which he can vent, as from without, a turmoil that is actually within&quot;. Sacrificial vessels allow for the extermination of an individual&#x27;s Guilt while enabling them to remain virtuous. 
Victimage is the second form of ritual purification. Burke highlights society&#x27;s need to rectify division within its ranks. He contended that &quot;People so dislike the idea of division, their dislike can easily be turned against the man or group who would so much as name it, let alone proposing to act upon it&quot;. Victimage allows for the creation of a scapegoat that serves as a depository of impurities in order to protect against entities that are alien to a particular society. The scapegoat takes on the sins of the impure, thus allowing redemption for the Guilty party. Through the course of these actions the scape goat is harnessed with the sins of the Guilty.

Redemption is reached through one of two options. Tragic redemption revolves around the idea that guilt combines with the principles of perfection and substitution in order that victimage can be utilized. This can be viewed as the &quot;guilty is removed from the rhetorical community through either scapegoating or mortification&quot;. Comic enlightenment is the second form of redemption. This option allows the sins of the guilty to be adopted by Society as a whole, ultimately making Society guilty by association.

===Terministic screen===
Another key concept for Burke is the Terministic screen—a &quot;set&quot; of symbols that becomes a kind of &quot;screen&quot; or grid of intelligibility through which the world makes sense to us. Here Burke offers rhetorical theorists and critics a way of understanding the relationship between language and ideology. Language, Burke thought, doesn&#x27;t simply &quot;reflect&quot; reality; it also helps &quot;select&quot; reality as well as &quot;deflect&quot; reality. In &quot;Language as Symbolic Action&quot; (1966), he writes, &quot;Even if any given terminology is a &quot;reflection&quot; of reality, by its very nature as a terminology it must be a &quot;selection&quot; of reality; and to this extent must function also as a &quot;deflection&quot; of reality. 
Burke describes terministic screens as reflections of reality—we see these symbols as things that direct our attention to the topic at hand. For example, photos of the same object with different filters each direct the viewer&#x27;s attention differently, much like how different subjects in academia grab the attention differently. Burke states, &quot;We must use terministic screens, since we can&#x27;t say anything without the use of terms; whatever terms we use, they necessarily constitute a corresponding kind of screen; and any such screen necessarily directs the attention to one field rather than another.&quot; Burke drew not only from the works of Shakespeare and Sophocles, but from films and radio that were important to pop culture, because they were teeming with &quot;symbolic and rhetorical ingredients.&quot; We as a people can be cued to accept the screen put in front of us, and mass culture such as TV and websites can be to blame for this. Media today has altered terministic screens, or as Richard Toye wrote in his book &quot;Rhetoric: A Very Short Introduction&quot;, the &quot;linguistic filters which cause us to see situations in particular fashions.&quot;

===Identification===
Burke viewed identification as a critical element of persuasion. According to Burke, as we listen to someone speak, we gauge how similar that person is to us. If our opinions match, then we identify (rhetorically) with the speaker. Based on how much we identify with the speaker, we may be moved to accept the conclusions that the speaker comes to in an argument, as well as all (or most) of its implications. In &quot;A Rhetoric of Motives&quot;, Burke not only explores self-identification within a rhetorical context, but also analyzes exterior identification, such as identifying with objects and concepts that are not the self. There are several other facets to identification that Burke discusses within his books, such as consubstantiality, property, autonomy, and cunning. 

Burke&#x27;s exploration of identification within rhetoric heavily influenced modern rhetorical theory. He revolutionized rhetoric in the West with his exploration of identification, arguing that rhetoric is not only about &quot;rational argument plus emotion&quot;, but also that it involves people connecting to language and one another at the same time. Burke’s theory of identification was complicated by his critical interest in music, prompting a shift toward distinguishing between form and information in sonic identification.

==Principal works==
In &quot;Definition of Man&quot;, the first essay of his collection &quot;Language as Symbolic Action&quot; (1966), Burke defined humankind as a &quot;symbol using animal&quot; (p. 3). This definition of man, he argued, means that &quot;reality&quot; has actually &quot;been built up for us through nothing but our symbol systems&quot; (p. 5). Without our encyclopedias, atlases, and other assorted reference guides, we would know little about the world that lies beyond our immediate sensory experience. What we call &quot;reality,&quot; Burke stated, is actually a &quot;clutter of symbols about the past combined with whatever things we know mainly through maps, magazines, newspapers, and the like about the present ... a construct of our symbol systems&quot; (p. 5). College students wandering from class to class, from English literature to sociology to biology to calculus, encounter a new reality each time they enter a classroom; the courses listed in a university&#x27;s catalogue &quot;are in effect but so many different terminologies&quot; (p. 5). It stands to reason then that people who consider themselves to be Christian, and who internalize that religion&#x27;s symbol system, inhabit a reality that is different from the one of practicing Buddhists, or Jews, or Muslims. The same would hold true for people who believe in the tenets of free market capitalism or socialism, Freudian psychoanalysis or Jungian depth psychology, as well as mysticism or materialism. Each belief system has its own vocabulary to describe how the world works and what things mean, thus presenting its adherents with a specific reality.

Burke&#x27;s poetry (which has drawn little critical attention and seldom been anthologized) appears in three collections: &quot;Book of Moments&quot; (1955), &quot;Collected Poems 1915–1967&quot; (1968), and the posthumously published &quot;Late Poems: 1968-1993 Attitudinizings Verse-wise, While Fending for One&#x27;s Selph, and in a Style Somewhat Artificially Colloquial&quot; (2005). His fiction is collected in &quot;Here &amp; Elsewhere: The Collected Fiction of Kenneth Burke&quot; (2005).

<text>Boris Grigoryevich Fyodorov (; 13 February 1958 – 20 November 2008) was a Russian economist, politician, and reformer.

==Early life==
He was awarded a doctor of economics degree from the Moscow Finance Institute and authored over 200 publications.

==Career==
In 1988 working very closely with Fyodorov, Alexander Zhukov, and Kirill Ugolnikov (), Deloitte &amp; Touche began providing services to the Soviet Union and continued with Russia.

Fyodorov was Minister of Finance of the Russian SFSR (as a constituent of the USSR) in 1990. From 1991 to 1992 he worked for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London. In 1992 he became director of the World Bank. He served as Finance Minister of Russia from 1993 until 1994, when he resigned. While he was at the Ministry of Finance (MinFin), he brought to MinFin Segei Aleksashenko, Andrey Kazmin, Igor Selivanov, and Mikhail Kasyanov. Fyodorov was a member of the State Duma between 1994 and 1998. From 14 August 1998 until 28 September 1998, he became a tax minister and Deputy Prime Minister of Russia during the Russian financial crisis which began on 17 August 1998.

==United Financial Group==
In 1994, he and Charles Ryan, a United States banker and Libertarian, founded United Financial Group (UFG), an investment bank with Charles Ryan as its chairman, which, in 2005, was sold to Deutsche Bank. United Financial Group was established with a Moscow-based parent firm and an Isle of Man based United Financial Group firm managing its shell companies around the world. The address of the Isle of Man-based UFG firm is the same address as the Isle of Man office of Deloitte &amp; Touche.

Fyodorov was a member of various boards including Gazprom, Sberbank and Ingosstrakh.

In February 2002, while Fyodorov was an independent director of Gazprom, he stated that PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) signed off on poorly performed audits of natural gas firm interactions such as Gazprom-Itera because PwC wanted to keep the account with Gazprom saying &quot;If an auditor knows it cannot do a proper review, then it is just doing it for the money.&quot; Further, he said that any audits by Deloitte &amp; Touche into the Gazprom-Itera interactions were strongly opposed by Gazprom management.

He was also a general partner of UFG Private Equity starting from 2006.

Fyodorov died from a stroke on 20 November 2008 in London, England, at the age of 50.

<doc id="729976" wikidata="Q232397" url="?curid=729976" title="Shannyn Sossamon">
<text>Shannon Marie Kahololani &quot;Shannyn&quot; Sossamon (born October 3, 1978) is an American actress. She has appeared in the films &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2001), &quot;40 Days and 40 Nights&quot; (2002), &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (2002), &quot;The Order&quot; (2003), &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; (2005), &quot;The Holiday&quot; (2006), &quot;&quot; (2006), &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot; (2009), &quot;The End of Love&quot; (2012), and &quot;Sinister 2&quot; (2015).

As a musician, she provided vocals and drums to Warpaint from 2004 to 2008. She abruptly left the group after recording their first EP. Sossamon&#x27;s sole recording with the band is the 2009 EP &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot;.

In 2009, Sossamon began directing and producing shorts and music videos through her small production company, the Maudegone Theater.

== Early life ==
Shannon Marie Kahololani Sossamon was born in Hawaii, and was raised in Reno, Nevada. Her ancestry includes Dutch, English, French, German, Irish, Filipino, and Hawaiian.

Her parents divorced when she was five, and Sossamon and her sister were then raised by her mother, who married Randy Goldman, a salesman and manager of an auto dealership. Sossamon attended Galena High School in Reno, graduating in 1995.

The day after her high school graduation, she relocated to Los Angeles with two friends, to study dance. &quot;Nothing compares to that feeling when you first leave home and arrive somewhere new,&quot; she once recalled. &quot;When we woke up in the morning, just making coffee felt amazing. It felt like being so free – just to wake up and make coffee and look at our couch.&quot; The y in her first name was an alteration in 1995.

== Career ==

=== 1995–2002: Early work and breakthrough ===
After moving to Los Angeles in 1995, she began to work as a DJ, booking gigs in local clubs and performance venues. While Sossamon was pursuing a career in dance, she actually never planned to become a professional dancer, recalling: &quot;It was more like I just love to do this. It wasn&#x27;t clear what I wanted, but I was fine with that. I had never needed a plan. I&#x27;m really good at feeling safe in the unknown aspects of planning your life&quot;. Around that time, Sossamon established her early career by modeling for various companies including &quot;Sassy Magazine&quot;, Unionbay Clothing, American Eagle Outfitters, and Planned Parenthood. She appeared in two television commercials for Gap and in music videos for artists such as Daft Punk, The Goo Goo Dolls, Cher, DJ Quik, and the rock group 9xdead. In 1997, Sossamon guest-starred as several characters in three episodes of &quot;Mr. Show with Bob and David&quot;, and two years later, she was discovered by casting director Francine Maisler, while assisting a fellow DJ at Gwyneth Paltrow&#x27;s brother&#x27;s birthday party.

Sossamon beat Kate Hudson for the lead female role in Brian Helgeland&#x27;s adventure dramedy &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, opposite Heath Ledger. She was cast as Lady Jocelyn, the love interest of a peasant (Ledger) pretending to be a knight. The film premiered on May 11, 2001, and received average reviews, with her part getting an equally mixed response; Robin Clifford for &quot;Reeling Reviews&quot; concluded that Sossamon was &quot;pretty but little more than an object of affection&quot; and Rob Blackwelder of &quot;SPLICEDwire&quot; called her role &quot;the movie&#x27;s weakest link&quot;, noting that although Sossamon was a &quot;wonderfully wicked flirt&quot;, her character &quot;isn&#x27;t terribly well established and she&#x27;s the most jarringly modern sight in this ancient tale&quot;. &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; garnered US$117,487,473 worldwide, bringing Sossamon into mainstream audiences. It earned her two Teen Choice Awards nominations as well as three MTV Movie Awards nominations, including one for &quot;Best Breakthrough Performance&quot;.

Sossamon appeared in the music video for &quot;God Gave Me Everything&quot; by Mick Jagger in 2001. The video was directed by Mark Romanek and features Jagger, Lenny Kravitz, and Sossamon. 

In 2002, Sossamon starred in the romantic comedy &quot;40 Days and 40 Nights&quot;, as Erica Sutton, the love interest of Josh Hartnett&#x27;s character, Matt Sullivan. It received mixed reviews from critics, but was a major box office success, earning a worldwide total of US$95,146,283 on a production budget of US$17 million. Sossamon&#x27;s part gained critical acclaim in general; About.com noted that she was &quot;already making a name for herself as a romantic leading lady. With starring roles opposite two of Hollywood&#x27;s hottest young actors (Hartnett and Heath Ledger) under her belt, Shannyn&#x27;s star is rising fast. Her exotic looks separate her from the pack, and her performances have, thus far, been exceptional&quot;. Praising Sossamon and co-star Harnett, Elvis Mitchell wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Mr. Hartnett matches up with Ms. Sossamon, and not only because their eyebrows signal that they are both Vulcans. She is a more direct performer; what she does is not acting – yet – but she can look as if she&#x27;s listening. Her approach contrasts hilariously with his gentility&quot;. Afterwards, both actors received a Teen Choice Award nomination for &quot;Choice Film Chemistry&quot;.

Sossamon subsequently played Lauren Hynde in Roger Avary&#x27;s dark satirical ensemble &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;. The film, about a promiscuous college student, included scenes of suicide, heavy drug use, and sexual content. It received polarizing reviews from critics. Critical response for Sossamon was more favorable, with &quot;Joblo.com&quot; commenting that the actress was &quot;very believable and empathetic&quot; as her character. David Noh of &quot;Film Journal International&quot; found her performance &quot;heartbreaking&quot; and described it as &quot;an uncanny blend of fragile-fey and urchin-tough, marked by a feverish wit which often proves her undoing as much as her salvation&quot;. Also showing approval of her portrayal, Avary remarked during an interview the actress was &quot;like a wild animal you can&#x27;t really control. What she does and what she brings is complete and honest truth to the scene. Something real.” Ellis, meanwhile, stated that Sossamon &quot;hasn&#x27;t had much of a chance to shine before, but she&#x27;s a star. She seems freer in this movie than she was before and is totally empathetic, which is a quality that doesn&#x27;t come easily to most actors&quot;. &quot;Rules of Attraction&quot; is considered a cult hit; it grossed US$11,819,244 worldwide, almost tripling its budget (US$4 million).

=== 2003–05: Hiatus ===
Sossamon and Heath Ledger starred together again in Brian Helgeland&#x27;s supernatural thriller &quot;The Order&quot;. It was released in late 2003, to extremely poor reviews; Critical reception for Sossamon was average with &quot;7M Pictures&quot; finding the movie &quot;well acted&quot; by the leads but &quot;eFilmCritic.com&quot; remarking that she, &quot;so charming in both &quot;&quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; and 4&quot;0 Days and 40 Nights&quot;, is given very little to do besides utilize her &#x27;tortured soul with dark eye makeup&#x27; schtick&quot;. The movie failed at the box office, opening at number six at the charts; it finished its theatrical run with US$11 million on a budget of US$35 million.

After Sossamon filmed &quot;The Order&quot;, she became pregnant and took a hiatus from working on film productions; &quot;It was almost like she was out on a lark, and she found herself in this big circumstance that she hadn&#x27;t planned on, which I think made it easier for her to go off and have a baby and stop working&quot;, director Helgeland said on the actress&#x27; motherhood and subsequent acting break. She has recalled seeing her acting career in a &quot;total stop&quot; after giving birth, but nevertheless described her absence on screen as a &quot;blessing in disguise for many reasons&quot;. Her only acting appearance of 2004 was a guest-starring role on the NBC series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, in the episode “Doubt”.

Her next vehicle was the horror thriller &quot;Devour&quot;, in which she played Marisol, one of several friends who become increasingly addicted to a video game that has an evil agenda. A B movie, it did not receive a theatrical release and instead, went directly-to-DVD in 2005. Critical reception towards the picture was unanimously negative, but a few reviewers showed approval of the cast members&#x27; performances, with &quot;DVD Talk&quot; noting that Sossamon, alongside co-star Dominique Swain, &quot;do the best they can with the material they&#x27;re given, but end up as not much more than eye-candy stuck in a sea of aimless gore and maddeningly vague plot droppings&quot;. At the time, she had a small role in the black action comedy &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&quot; (2005).
She played Josie in the dramedy &quot;Undiscovered&quot;, which followed a group of aspiring entertainers who intend to establish their careers in Los Angeles. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, the movie premiered on August 26, 2005, to lackluster sales and critical failure. &quot;Chasing Ghosts&quot;, a mystery thriller starring Sossamon, was released straight-to-video in late 2005. As &quot;Undiscovered&quot;, this movie received negative reviews and was a box office bomb, failing to recoup its budget.

=== 2006–08: &quot;Wristcutters&quot; and &quot;Moonlight&quot; ===
Sossamon was cast as the female lead in the indie romantic black comedy &quot;&quot;, which was based on an Etgar Keret short story and co-starred Patrick Fugit, revolving around two characters who fall in love in purgatory after committing suicide. It was shown at both The Sundance Film Festival and The Seattle International Film Festival Awards in early 2006, before going on to open in a limited theatrical run in October 2007. The movie premiered to popular and critical acclaim, garnering a cult following since then. Sossamon, similarly, received positive feedback for her performance; &quot;Variety&quot; felt she made her character &quot;feisty and alluring&quot; in a &quot;resigned goth-girl kind of way&quot;, while Matthew Turner of &quot;View London&quot; remarked that she &quot;gives her best performance to date.&quot; &quot;Wristcutters&quot; was nominated for several awards, including Sundance&#x27;s Grand Jury Prize, two Independent Spirit Awards, and the Humanitas Prize.

She appeared as Maggie, Jack Black&#x27;s girlfriend in Nancy Meyers&#x27; romantic comedy &quot;The Holiday&quot;. The movie co-starred Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, and Jude Law, and premiered in December 2006. It was a major commercial success, with US$205,135,324 grossed worldwide. On January 2, 2007, she debuted on Courteney Cox&#x27;s drama series &quot;Dirt&quot; on FX. She played Kira Klay, a troubled young drug-addicted actress who kills herself after realizing that she is pregnant. She appears in the pilot episode and four more episodes as a ghostly figment of Ian Hart&#x27;s character&#x27;s imagination, becoming a sort of love interest. Her last airdate was on March 27, 2007 (episode &quot;Ita Missa Est&quot;). She also starred in the horror movie &quot;Catacombs&quot; as Victoria, a young woman trying to find her way out of the Paris Catacombs while being pursued by a killer. It received a theatrical release in countries like Italy and Japan throughout 2007, but came out directly-to-DVD in United States in February 2008. &quot;Catacombs&quot; and Sossamon generated mostly negative reviews; About.com wrote that her &quot;Ambien-induced acting doesn&#x27;t help matters&quot;, and &quot;DVD Verdict&quot; stated: &quot;This film is all Sossamon and I feel for her. Aside from the uninspired twist finale, her performance is solely of gasping and looking worried and furrowing her brow and screaming and gazing worriedly at her flickering flashlight&quot;.
Sossamon signed on as a series regular on CBS&#x27; vampire drama &quot;Moonlight&quot;, to play the character of Coraline Duvall. The series began airing on September 28, 2007, and was watched by 8.54 million viewers, finishing first among total viewers and adults 18–49 for its night. CBS ordered a 16-episode first season, but over the season, viewership decreased to around 7.5 million viewers. The series had a very large fan base, but despite fans&#x27; efforts, CBS canceled the series after the first season.

Sossamon starred as Beth Raymond in &quot;One Missed Call&quot;, a remake of Takashi Miike&#x27;s 2003 Japanese horror film of the same name. It revolved around a group of college students who start receiving voice-mails from their future selves which include the date and time of their deaths. The movie had its U.S. premiere on January 4, 2008, and fared &quot;decently&quot; on its opening weekend, with an estimated US$13.5 million in sales, as noted by Box Office Mojo. It went on to gross US$45 million in theaters, on a production budget of US$20 million. Reception towards the film was heavily negative, with critics describing it as one of the &quot;weakest&quot; J-horror remakes to be released. &quot;Georgia Straight&quot; writer Steve Newton felt that Sossamon tried &quot;desperately to bring some substance to her role&quot;, but the &quot;preposterous script&quot; made it a &quot;lost cause&quot;. Despite the critical reaction, the actress was nominated for the &quot;Choice Film Actress – Horror&quot; Award at the 2008 Teen Choice Awards.

=== 2009–12: Indie film route ===
She played Concetta, a woman faced with the challenges of raising her sick child and supporting her husband in the indie drama &quot;Life Is Hot in Cracktown&quot;, directed by Buddy Giovinazzo, and co-starring Kerry Washington, Lara Flynn Boyle and Brandon Routh. The movie was first screened at the 2009 Fantasia International Film Festival, and received a limited theatrical release in June that year; it went to DVD two months later. She also made a brief appearance in the romantic comedy &quot;Our Family Wedding&quot; and appeared as one of the leads in the thriller &quot;The Heavy&quot;, which had a U.S. straight-to-video release in April 2010. Around that time, she served as a feature jury at the 8th Indian Film Festival in Los Angeles.

Sossamon signed on to play a recurring character (Gingy Wu) in the HBO television series &quot;How to Make It in America&quot;. The series premiered in February 2010, with the actress appearing in eight episodes throughout the show&#x27;s first season. She created &quot;Maudegone Theater&quot; also in 2010, an online-video project under which she releases short and musical features directed by herself. Eight videos have been premiered under the moniker as of 2013. During an interview with Keba Robinson, of &quot;Hook and Line&quot; magazine, Sossamon explained that her initiative for creating &quot;Maudegone&quot; was about having &quot;some sort of control and do creative things and feel like it was something that I started. I like the feeling of independence and freedom&quot;.

Sossamon starred in Monte Hellman&#x27;s independent romantic thriller &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot;. Her role was Laurel Graham, a non-professional actress invited to star in a movie by a director who falls in love with her. Sossamon was the first person to be cast in the film after writer Steven Gaydos saw her in a restaurant rehearsing a scene with another person. Reluctant, Gaydos gave the actress his card saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t do this often, but I wonder if you or your agent would contact [director] Monte Hellman&quot;. The movie screened at the 67th Venice International Film Festival in September 2010, and received a very limited theatrical release in the U.S. the following year. It generated mostly positive reactions from critics, with Sossamon&#x27;s role gaining a similar response. Kevin Thomas, of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked that the film &quot;ultimately stands on the beauty and talent of its femme fatale, and Shannyn Sossamon is so stunning and gifted she actually withstands a remark comparing her to Louise Brooks&quot;. Meanwhile, Colin Convert for &quot;Star Tribune&quot; wrote in his review: &quot;The key to the movie is casting the right femme fatale, and non-actress Shannyn Sossamon, the mystery woman&#x27;s eerie doppelgänger, wins the part and her director&#x27;s heart&quot;.

She was cast with Ashley Bell, Dominic Monaghan and Shawn Ashmore in the indie thriller &quot;The Day&quot;, which follows a group of people fighting to stay alive in a post-apocalyptic future. The picture premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and later received a theatrical release in a limited run in August 2012. It received generally mixed or average reviews; while &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; praised the cast, &quot;Blu-ray.com&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; magazine criticized Sossamon for &quot;weaving in and out&quot; of her character&#x27;s southern accent. On January 15, 2012, &quot;The Cyclist&quot;, a short film starring Sossamon, premiered; it was screened later that year at the Las Vegas Film Festival.

She appeared in the indie romantic drama &quot;The End of Love&quot; as Lydia, a single mother and the love interest of Mark Webber&#x27;s character. The movie debuted at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and opened theatrically in a limited run in March 2013. Reviews for the film were largely positive, with Sossamon earning top notices. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Charlie Schmidlin concluded that the actress &quot;radiates warmth&quot; and noted that her part in the movie &quot;is the most natural and welcome performance I&#x27;ve seen from her&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Time Out&quot; found Sossamon &quot;captivating&quot; and &quot;enormously appealing&quot;, respectively.

=== 2013–present: television work ===
Sossamon then appeared in &quot;Desire&quot;, another short feature and a collaboration between Jaguar and Ridley Scott Associates, to help kick off the 2014 Jaguar F-Type. The 13-minute video, directed by Adam Smith and co-starring Damian Lewis, is about a car delivery man who gets caught up in a dangerous chase involving a woman in trouble (who is played by Sossamon). It had initially a debut at the 2013 Sundance London Film and Music Festival and was then posted on YouTube. On June 30, 2013, she debuted as Alex in the ABC drama &quot;Mistresses&quot;. Her character had a &quot;multi-episode arc&quot; during the first season of the series, with her last airdate being September 2 (episode &quot;When One Door Closes...&quot;). Sossamon accepted the role as it was a &quot;softer character&quot; for her to play, given she had been in a career hiatus due to her second pregnancy. At the time, it was announced that Sossamon was cast to play one of the main parts in M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s limited series for FOX, &quot;Wayward Pines&quot;. Her role was Theresa Burke, the wife of Matt Dillon&#x27;s character, and the show premiered on May 14, 2015. &quot;Wayward Pines&quot; received mostly favorable reviews from critics and after a debut described as &quot;soft&quot; by &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;, viewership for the series grew in subsequent episodes.

She provided her voice for a character named Lorna during an episode of &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;, which aired on November 6, 2014 (&quot;Chapter 7: The Ringing of the Bell&quot;) She next had a starring role in the supernatural horror sequel &quot;Sinister 2&quot;, where she played a mother whose sons are tormented by ghostly children. The movie was released worldwide on August 21, 2015, generating overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics. However, it has grossed over US$48 million on a budget of US$10 million. Sossamon played Pandora in the third season of FOX&#x27;s &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, in which she was a series regular.

== Personal life ==
Besides acting, Sossamon continues to study music and dance. After the birth of her first child, she started to learn how to play the guitar, with lessons about four days a week, as she wanted to create a band with her sister Jenny Lee Lindberg, who knew how to play the bass. Shortly afterwards, they formed Warpaint, an indie rock and psychedelic band formed in Los Angeles. As all the members were playing the guitar at the beginning, she became the drummer of the group: &quot;When we all started the band together, no one was playing drums, it was like all of us on guitars, and we needed a drummer. We tried out a pool of drummers and then one day I just decided to sit on the drum kit and it really worked and I had so much fun&quot;.

When asked about her interest in pursuing a musical career as a solo artist following her work with the band Warpaint, Sossamon responded that although she writes a lot of songs by herself, &quot;music requires focus and discipline in a way that I need to have for other things right now&quot;. Despite her musical work, she has clarified she rarely calls herself a musician, as she does not &quot;practice or play nearly as much as the great ones do. Most of my days and thoughts are taken up by stories, feelings, and pictures. Music is present in them, too, but always having to do with a picture.&quot;

<text>Barkat Gourad Hamadou (; 1 January 1930 – 18 March 2018) was the Prime Minister of Djibouti from 2 October 1978 until 7 March 2001.

==Political career==
Hamadou was a member of the Afar ethnic group and was born in Tew&#x27;o, Dikhil Region, in the southwest of Djibouti. Prior to Djibouti&#x27;s independence, he was a member of the Senate of France; he was first elected as a Senator on 26 September 1965, and he was re-elected on 22 September 1974. After Djibouti became independent in June 1977, Hamadou served in the government as Minister of Health. President Hassan Gouled Aptidon then appointed him as prime minister on 30 September 1978, and his first government was formed on 2 October 1978; in addition to serving as prime minister, Hamadou held the Ports portfolio in that government.

Hamadou was the first candidate on the candidate list of the ruling People&#x27;s Rally for Progress (RPP) for the District of Djibouti in the December 1992 parliamentary election. Following the election, Hamadou was reappointed as prime minister by Gouled on 4 February 1993, with a government composed of 18 ministers (including Hamadou). A peace agreement with the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD), an Afar rebel group, was signed in 1994; Hamadou played an important role in this agreement. A new government that included members of FRUD was formed on 8 June 1995. Hamadou remained prime minister in this government and was additionally assigned the development portfolio.

Hamadou was the first candidate on the RPP/FRUD candidate list for the District of Djibouti in the December 1997 parliamentary election. After this election he was again reappointed as prime minister, with a 17-member government (including Hamadou), on 28 December 1997. After Gouled was succeeded by Ismail Omar Guelleh in May 1999, Hamadou was retained as prime minister.

On the night of 9 March 2000, Hamadou was admitted to the French army hospital in Djibouti due to heart trouble. He was then moved to Paris, where he was hospitalized from March 2000 to October 2000. Although he was re-elected as vice-president of the RPP in early 2001, he subsequently submitted his resignation as prime minister to President Guelleh on 6 February 2001 due to poor health. Guelleh accepted the resignation, and Hamadou was succeeded by Dileita Mohamed Dileita on 7 March 2001. Hamadou later resigned as RPP vice-president due to his health and was succeeded in that post by Dileita on 3 July 2003.

==Death==
Hamadou died 18 March 2018 in Paris, aged 88.
