<text>The Longfellow Bridge is a steel rib arch bridge spanning the Charles River to connect Boston&#x27;s Beacon Hill neighborhood with the Kendall Square area of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The bridge carries Massachusetts Route 3, the MBTA Red Line, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. The structure was originally known as the Cambridge Bridge, and a predecessor structure was known as the West Boston Bridge; Boston also continued to use &quot;West Boston Bridge&quot; officially for the new bridge. The bridge is also known to locals as the &quot;Salt-and-Pepper Bridge&quot; due to the shape of its central towers.

The bridge falls under the jurisdiction and oversight of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). The bridge carries approximately 28,600 cars and 90,000 mass-transit passengers every weekday. A portion of the MBTA subway&#x27;s elevated Charles/MGH station lies at the eastern end of the bridge, which connects to Charles Circle.

==Design==

Longfellow Bridge is a combination railway and highway bridge. It is wide, long between abutments, and nearly one-half mile in length, including abutments and approaches. It consists of eleven steel arch spans supported on ten masonry piers and two massive abutments. The arches vary in length from at the abutments to at the center, and in rise from to . Headroom under the central arch is at mean high water.

The two large central piers, long and wide, feature four carved, ornamental stone towers. The towers are ornamented with the prows of Viking ships, carved in granite. They refer to a purported voyage by Leif Eriksson up the Charles River circa 1000 AD, promoted at the time by Harvard professor Eben Horsford. The piers are also decorated with the city seals of Boston and Cambridge.

The Longfellow Bridge provides a panoramic view of the Boston skyline. In commenting on riding the Red Line over the bridge, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; praised its &quot;view of Boston’s beauty in a single, satisfying gulp&quot;.
==History==
The first river crossing at this site was a ferry, first run in the 1630s. The West Boston Bridge (a toll bridge) was constructed in 1793 by a group of private investors with a charter from the Commonwealth. At the time, there were only a handful of buildings in East Cambridge. The opening of the bridge caused a building boom along Main Street in Cambridge, which connected the bridge to Old Cambridge. In East Cambridge, new streets were laid out and land was reclaimed from the swamps along the Charles River. The Cambridge and Concord Turnpike (now Broadway) was connected to the bridge&#x27;s western approach around 1812. The bridge became toll-free on January 30, 1858. The first horsecar line in Boston, the Cambridge Railroad running between Bowdoin Square and Harvard Square over the West Boston Bridge, opened on March 26, 1856. The bridge was the primary Boston–Cambridge link for the growing horsecar system, which was eventually consolidated as the West End Street Railway. The Harvard Square–Bowdoin Square line was electrified on February 16, 1889, by the West End - the second of its Boston-area lines to be so equipped.

In 1898, the Cambridge Bridge Commission was created to construct &quot;a new bridge across Charles River, to be known as Cambridge Bridge, at, upon, or near the site of the so-called West Boston Bridge... suitable for all the purposes of ordinary travel between said cities, and for the use of the elevated and surface cars of the Boston Elevated Railway Company.&quot; At its first meeting on June 16, 1898, Willam Jackson was appointed Chief Engineer; shortly afterward Edmund M. Wheelwright was appointed Consulting Architect. Both then traveled to Europe, where they made a thorough inspection of notable bridges in France, Germany, Austria and Russia. Upon their return, they prepared studies of various types of bridges, including bridges of stone and steel arch spans. Wheelwright had been inspired by the 1893 Columbian Exposition and was attempting to emulate the great bridges of Europe. 

Although both state and national regulations at the time required a draw bridge, it became evident that a bridge without a draw would be cheaper, better-looking, and avoid disruption to traffic. The state altered its regulations accordingly, and after the War Department declined to follow suit, the United States Congress drew up an act permitting the bridge, which President William McKinley signed on March 29, 1900. Construction began in July 1900; the bridge opened to traffic in August 1906, and was formally dedicated on July 31, 1907.

The Cambridge Bridge was renamed Longfellow Bridge in 1927, by the Massachusetts General Court to honor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who had written about the predecessor West Boston Bridge in his 1845 poem &quot;The Bridge&quot;.

There are pedestrian stairs on both sides of the bridge at both ends adorned with stone towers. Originally, these led to the Charles River shoreline, and on the Cambridge side they still do. On the Boston side, the construction of Storrow Drive in 1950-51 moved the shoreline, so that the stairs now lead to isolated parcels of land cut off from the river by Storrow Drive. There is no way to exit the upstream parcel, due to an off-ramp; the downstream one includes a crosswalk past another off-ramp. To reach the Charles River Esplanade, pedestrians must now proceed along the sidewalk to the end of the bridge, and use the Frances Appleton Bridge, a wheelchair-accessible pedestrian bridge, at Charles Circle slightly south of the Longfellow Bridge.

The new bridge was built with streetcar tracks plus an initially unused center reservation. On March 23, 1912, the Cambridge–Dorchester line (now the Red Line) opened from Harvard Square to , with tracks on the bridge reservation connecting the Cambridge tunnel with the Beacon Hill tunnel. Streetcar traffic over the bridge was greatly reduced by the subway line; on December 14, 1925, the final streetcar route over the bridge was replaced by a Kendall Square–Bowdoin Square bus route. Charles station opened at the Boston end of the bridge on February 27, 1932, serving the West End and Massachusetts General Hospital; the bus route was discontinued. From 1924 to 1952, non-revenue trains from the East Boston Tunnel ran on the streetcar tracks over the bridge, switching onto the Cambridge–Dorchester line tracks near the Cambridge end. These moves, usually performed late at night, allow trains to reach the Eliot Shops, as the East Boston Tunnel had no heavy maintenance facility. Both streetcar tracks were used until the 1930s, when the south track was removed.

===Neglect===
The Longfellow Bridge, like many bridges in the Commonwealth, deteriorated into a state of disrepair. Between 1907 and 2011, the only major maintenance conducted on the bridge had been a small 1959 rehabilitation project and some lesser repairs done in 2002.
In mid-2008, two state employees stole of decorative iron trim that had been removed from the bridge for refurbishment, and sold it for scrap. The men, one of whom was a Department of Conservation and Recreation district manager, were charged with receiving $12,147 for the historic original parapet coping. The estimated cost to remake the pieces, scheduled for replication by 2012, was over $500,000. The men were later convicted in September 2009.

In mid-2008, the western sidewalk and inner traffic lane were both closed, the Red Line subway was limited to , and Fourth-of-July fireworks-watchers were banned from the bridge because of concerns that the bridge might collapse under the weight and vibration of heavy use. The speed restriction was lifted in August 2008, and the lane and sidewalk were reopened later on. On August 4, 2008, Governor Deval Patrick signed into law a $3 billion Massachusetts bridge repair funding package he had sponsored. The funds raised from the sale of bonds were used to pay for the rehabilitation of the Longfellow Bridge, the preliminary cost estimated at $267.5 million. If bridge maintenance had instead been performed regularly, the total estimated historical cost would have been about $81 million. Design began in Spring 2005; construction was expected to begin in Spring 2012 and end in Spring 2016.

Ownership and management of the overhaul was transferred from the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) to the new Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) on November 1, 2009, along with other DCR bridges.
The condition of the bridge was determined to be so bad that the state could not wait for development of a full restoration plan. A $17 million contract was signed with SPS New England Inc for interim repairs. Crews began work in August 2010 that involved improving sidewalks on the approaches to bring them up to ADA compliance. In March 2011, crews began structural inspections for Phase II and cleaning of the stone masonry piers. MassDOT announced in May 2011 that work would begin on stripping and cleaning rust from steel arch ribbons that had not been painted since 1953. Crews were to apply paint primer to the arch ribbons and evaluate them for future major rehabilitation. All work was expected to be completed by December 2011.

===Major reconstruction project===

A $255 million project started construction in the summer of 2013 to replace structural elements of the bridge, and restore its historic character. The project was expected to require at least 25 weekend shutdowns of MBTA Red Line subway service to accommodate construction, including multiple temporary relocations of the rapid transit tracks. Outbound road traffic (from Boston to Cambridge) was to be detoured from the bridge for all three years of expected construction. A single lane of inbound traffic was expected to be available for the duration of the project, potentially restricted to buses-only at certain hours. A computer animation movie released by MassDOT showed the complex six-stage rehabilitation process in great detail, including temporary installation of a &quot;shoo-fly track&quot; (bypass track) to allow the permanent railbed at the midline of the span to be rebuilt.

The design/build phase of the bridge was assigned to the joint venture team of contractors White-Skanska-Conslgli under supervision by MassDOT. Preliminary design engineering was performed by Jacobs Engineering. STV, Inc. was the final design engineer and engineer of record. The design provided for widened sidewalks and bike lanes, with two motor vehicle lanes inbound (towards Boston), but only a single lane outbound (towards Cambridge).

The Longfellow Bridge is considered to be the most important historic bridge in the City of Boston due to its prominent location over the Charles River and outstanding visual and architectural quality. The primary aim of the rehabilitation project was to address the bridge&#x27;s structural deficiencies, upgrade its capacity and bring it up to date with modern codes while also preserving its visual and historic architectural character. A significant portion of the restoration work lay with dismantling, cleaning, restoring, and re-erecting the 58-foot-tall towers that frame the river&#x27;s navigation channel, which had settled over time.

The Longfellow Bridge Restoration and Rehabilitation project was scheduled for completion in 2016, but the completion date was extended to December 2018, due in part to historic restoration requiring obsolete construction techniques such as riveting. In August 2016, the outbound side of the bridge was completely closed to all traffic, including pedestrians and cyclists, in order to complete work sooner. This measure was undertaken to allow the bridge to be fully reopened by June 2018. After years of delays, the bridge was fully reopened on May 31, 2018, but portions of the project, such as replacing the pedestrian footbridge over Storrow Drive, were completed by the fall of 2018. According to Jonathan L. Gulliver, MassDOT Highway Administrator, the total cost of the rebuilding project was $306.6 million. After a settlement with its contractors, the state paid $305.5 million on a budgeted cost of $303.7 million, which had included cost overruns.

<doc id="743809" wikidata="Q1144892" url="?curid=743809" title="Patent attorney">
<text>A patent attorney is an attorney who has the specialized qualifications necessary for representing clients in obtaining patents and acting in all matters and procedures relating to patent law and practice, such as filing patent applications and oppositions to granted patents.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;patent attorney&quot; is used differently in different countries and thus may or may not require the same legal qualifications as a general legal practitioner.

The titles patent agent and patent lawyer are also used in some jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, the terms are interchangeable; in others, the latter is used only if the person is qualified as a lawyer.

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the International Federation of Intellectual Property Attorneys (FICPI) propose since 2022 a Patent Drafting Training Program to enhance the knowledge and skills of professionals, such as patent agents, who wish to strengthen their patent drafting skills.

==Role==
A study analyzing patent examination decisions at major patent offices shows that patent attorney firms play a crucial role in the prosecution process, especially in less codified and rapidly changing technology areas such as ICT.

== Qualification regimes ==
In Europe, requirements for practising as patent attorney before national patent offices should be distinguished from those needed for practising before the European Patent Office (EPO) or the Eurasian Patent Office (EAPO). On the national level, the requirements are not harmonized.

===Australia===
Registration as a patent attorney in Australia and New Zealand is administered by the Trans-Tasman IP Attorneys Board (the Board).

To apply to become a Trans-Tasman patent attorney, one must:

# pass the nine topics set out in Schedule 5 to the Patent Regulations 1991.
# hold a suitable tertiary educational qualification in a field of technology that contains potentially patentable subject matter.
# be a resident in Australia or New Zealand
# have been employed in a position or positions, for at least 2 continuous years or a total of 2 years within 5 continuous years, that provide the applicant experience in the following skills:
## searching patent records;
## preparation filing and prosecution of patent applications in Australia and with other countries;
## drafting of patent specifications;
## and provision of advice on interpretation, infringement and validity.
# be of good fame, integrity or character, and not have been convicted within the past five years of offences against Patents, Trade Marks and Designs legislation.

Until the late 1990s, topics were mainly taught and examined by members of the patent attorney profession under the oversight of the PSB, but this process has now been brought into the university system within Australia.

Once registered, a Patent and Trademark Attorney may be elected as a Fellow of the Institute of Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys of Australia.

=== Canada ===

To become a registered patent agent in Canada one must complete a series of four qualifying exams over four days. As of May 1, 2014, a patent agent trainee can sit the exams if the trainee is a resident in Canada and has worked in Canada in the area of Canadian patent law and practice, including the preparation and prosecution of applications, for a period of at least 24 months. Up to 12 months of practical experience will also be recognized for those entitled to practice before the patent office of another country. One may also qualify to sit for the exams if the individual is a resident of Canada and has been employed for at least 24 months on the examining staff at the Canadian patent office.

Each of the four exams (also referred to individually as Paper A, B, C, and D) is four hours in length. Paper A relates to the drafting of a patent application. Paper B relates to the validity of a patent. Paper C relates to the preparation of a response to an Official Action. Paper D relates to the infringement of a patent. Unlike the US system, the Canadian examination format is paper based with a variety of essay-type and short answer questions and is offered at least once a year, typically in April. Results are typically known within 5 months.

With a first-time passing rate near 1% and an overall passing rate of 7% in 2012 and trending downwards, the exam is notoriously challenging and most applicants attempt the exam over several years. To pass, candidates must score a minimum of 50 out of 100 on each paper, with a minimum aggregate mark of 240 on all four papers. Recent amendments to the pass requirements enable candidates to carry forward marks for a paper (if greater than 60 out of 100) if the minimum aggregate mark is not achieved or if the candidate failed one of the papers.

Review courses are held each summer and fall by IPIC (Intellectual Property Institute of Canada). The summer course tends to be more general in scope than the fall course, where drafting practice examinations is emphasised.

Once certified, a registered patent agent is given powers under the Canadian Patent Act to represent applicants applying to the Canadian Intellectual Property Office to obtain patent protection.

=== European Patent Organisation ===
The task of the European Patent Office (EPO), which is the main organ of the European Patent Organisation, is to grant European patents (and also to hear and determine third-party challenges to the validity of European patents, in opposition proceedings). The EPO exists by virtue of the European Patent Convention (EPC), and is not legally bound to the European Union.

To legally represent clients (generally patent applicants, proprietors and opponents) before the EPO, a patent attorney must first be registered to act in that capacity as a professional representative. To be registered, an individual must qualify as a European patent attorney and, to that end, must pass a written examination, the European Qualifying Examination (EQE). The EQE consists of four papers sat over three days, each day lasting between 5 hours and six and a half hours. Those who enroll for the examination must have an engineering or scientific degree (though long experience in a scientific domain can be sufficient under certain limited conditions), and the candidate must also have practised under supervision for at least two years in the domain of national or European patent law.

The EPC sets out the circumstances under which an applicant for a European patent must be represented by a professional representative in proceedings before the EPO. Typically, a representative is required if the patent applicant (or all of them if more than one) does not have a place of business in an EPC contracting state.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, only &quot;Patentanwälte&quot;/patent attorneys (or &quot;Rechtsanwälte&quot;/attorneys-at-Law, who are per se entitled to represent clients in all fields of law) are entitled to represent clients from abroad before the German Patent and Trade Mark Office (DPMA). German patent attorneys have done their university degrees in engineering or natural sciences and practised in industry before being accepted for an additional three years&#x27; education, i. e. completing legal training of 26 month with an established German patent attorney, at the same time studies of German Law and afterwards a training in intellectual property and an examination at the DPMA. They are further entitled to represent their clients before the German federal court of patents (and trademarks) and in patent cases (nullity) before the German Supreme Court.

=== Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong, there is no regulation on the profession of patent attorneys or agents. The main reason is that Hong Kong does not have a standard patent (20 years) original grant system. Hong Kong recognizes standard patents or patents for invention registered and granted in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, European Patent Office (designated UK), or United Kingdom. These patents can be re-registered in Hong Kong without examination within a prescribed period. On October 4, 2011, the Hong Kong SAR Government published a Consultation Paper on Review of the Patent System in Hong Kong.

=== India ===
In India, a person registered to practice before Indian Patent Office is called a &quot;Registered Patent Agent&quot; or simply &quot;Patent agent&quot;. The Indian Patent Law specifically does not mention the designation of &quot;Patent Attorney&quot;. Therefore, there are different roles for patent attorney and patent agent in India.

Indian Patent Office conducts a qualifying examination for patent agent registration yearly (earlier, it was twice a year). Indian Patent Law mandates a science or technical degree for person(s) to appear for the qualifying examination. Other criteria for eligibility include being an Indian Citizen, and 21 years of age. There are approximately 2000 registered patent agents in India as of April 1, 2010.

However, a decision on March 15, 2013, by the Madras High Court (Single Judge), stated that advocates, by possessing a law degree from a recognized university, have a right to file, appear and undertake all responsibilities of a patent agent. The single judge rejected the contention that to appear before the Patent Office, advocates required additional specific science/technical qualification such as B.Tech. in Information Technology etc. According to this judgement, Advocates having degree in Engineering and Science are &quot;Registered Patent Attorney&quot; in India.

=== Ireland ===
Under Section 107 of Ireland&#x27;s Patents Act, 1992 entry in the Register of Patent Agents requires that the applicant resides and has a place in a member state of the European Union and possesses the prescribed educational and professional qualifications, which are:
* Leaving Certificate or equivalent: a C grade in at least two higher level subjects (or ordinary level B grade) and a D grade in at least three other subjects
* First-year university (or equivalent) education in engineering, chemistry, or physics
* Employment for at least 3 years in the office of a registered patent agent in an EU member state
* Success at the following examinations:
**Irish law and practice of patents (set by Irish Patents Office)
**Drafting of patent specifications (set by United Kingdom&#x27;s JEB, Advanced Paper P3)
**Amendment of patent specifications (set by United Kingdom&#x27;s JEB, Advanced Paper P4)
**Infringement and validity (set by United Kingdom&#x27;s JEB, Advanced Paper P6)
As in the UK (see below), exemptions from the Drafting and Amendment papers can be obtained if the equivalent papers in the European Qualifying Examination have been passed.

===Japan===

Patent specialists in Japan are known as &quot;benrishi&quot; and must take a qualifying exam to receive the title. Benrishi are allowed to practice a variety of intellectual property law (patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret) and are given the power to represent clients in litigation and arbitration within the area specified by Patent Attorney Law in Japan. Barristers (&quot;bengoshi&quot;) are also qualified to work as patent attorneys in Article 3 of Practicing Attorney Law in Japan.
A patent attorney shall automatically be admitted to the &quot;Japan Patent Attorneys Association&quot; (Patent Attorney Act Art. 60).

===New Zealand===

To become registered as a Patent Attorney in New Zealand, one must:

#be a New Zealand citizen, Commonwealth citizen (British subject) or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland.
#be aged 21 (twenty one) years of age or over.
#have passed the New Zealand Patent Attorney Examinations.
#be of good character.
#have been employed for a period(s) of at least three years by a Patent Attorney in New Zealand, The Patent Office, or in a form of employment that offers substantially similar practical experience - see section 100 of the Patents Act 1953:

Registration as a Patent Attorney may then lead to election as a Fellow in the New Zealand Institute of Patent Attorneys.

Moreover, Australian Patent Attorneys are able to obtain registration to become New Zealand Patent Attorneys, and vice versa, as a result of a trans Tasman agreement between the two countries. Consequently, a large number of Australian Patent Attorneys are also New Zealand Patent Attorneys.

Their legal status is regulated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Enactment &quot;On affirmation of the Provision about the representatives in the sphere of intellectual property (patent attorneys)&quot; No. 545 on September 10, 1994. Examination and registration of patent attorneys are conducted by the State Intellectual Property Service of Ukraine.

=== United Kingdom ===

Any person can act at the UK Patent Office, but the titles &quot;Patent Agent&quot;, &quot;Patent Attorney&quot; and &quot;Registered Patent Attorney&quot; (which is synonymous with &quot;Registered Patent Agent&quot;) are reserved for those duly qualified. The title &quot;Patent Attorney&quot; may also be used by solicitors provided that they have specialist expertise in patents, whereas the term &quot;Patent Agent&quot; relates to persons who have passed the relevant specialized examinations.

Qualification is achieved by passing the PEB patent foundation level papers (or gaining an exemption by passing certain university courses such as that organised by Queen Mary University in London) and then the PEB patent advanced level papers.

The PEB patent foundation papers are FC1 (formerly P1) - UK Patent Law and Procedures, FC2 (formerly &quot;Law&quot;) - Basic English Law, FC3 (formerly P5) - International Patent Law, FC4 (formerly &quot;D&amp;C&quot;) - Designs &amp; Copyright, FC5 (formerly P7) - Trade Mark Law.

The PEB patent advanced papers are FD1 (formerly P2) - Patent Practice, FD2 (formerly P3) - Drafting a Patent Application, FD3 (formerly P4) - Amending a Patent Application and FD4 (formerly P6) - Infringement and Validity of a Patent. Exemptions from FD2 and FD3 can be obtained by passing the corresponding European Qualifying Exams (Papers A &amp; B respectively).

Membership of the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys as a Fellow gives the right to call oneself a Chartered Patent Agent or Chartered Patent Attorney. (To be elected as a Fellow, a person must have passed the UK Advanced Level exams, have accrued sufficient professional experience and be nominated by two existing Fellows.)

===United States===
In the United States, a practitioner may either be a patent attorney or patent agent. Patent practitioners need to be registered to practice and represent clients before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Patent practitioners may prepare, file, and prosecute patent applications. Patent practitioners may also provide patentability opinions, as noted by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Sperry v. Florida&quot;. In the time since the USPTO issued the first patent in 1790, approximately 73,000 have passed the USPTO registration examination, allowing them to register to prosecute patent applications. (This total does not include current patent examiners, who are not allowed to serve as patent attorneys or agents and thus do not appear on the list of enrolled practitioners.) Today, roughly 45,000 people are on the list of registered patent practitioners with slightly less than 34,000 of them also licensed to practice law. Of the states, California has the most patent practitioners, followed by New York and Texas. Per capita, Delaware has more patent practitioners than any state (not including DC). Patent practitioners are required to have a technical degree (such as engineering, chemistry or physics) and must take and pass the USPTO registration examination (officially titled Examination for Registration to Practice in Patent Cases Before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and commonly referred to as the Patent Bar).

Patent attorneys must also be admitted to the practice of law in at least one state or territory of the U.S. or in the District of Columbia. Since patent attorneys are admitted to practice law in a state or territory, they can additionally provide legal services outside the Patent Office if practicing within the jurisdiction they are admitted to practice or if the law of the jurisdiction otherwise permits them to practice although not admitted in that jurisdiction. These legal services include advising a client on matters relating to the licensing of the invention; whether to appeal a decision by the Patent Office to a court; whether to sue for infringement; whether someone is infringing upon the claims of a client&#x27;s issued patent; and conversely, whether a client is infringing the claims of someone else&#x27;s issued patent. Patent agents cannot provide legal services of this nature, nor can they represent clients before the Trademark Office part of the USPTO.

To register as a patent practitioner one must pass the USPTO registration examination. This exam, commonly referred to as the &quot;patent bar&quot;, tests a candidate&#x27;s knowledge of patent law and USPTO policies and procedures as set forth in the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP). The exam consists of 100 questions in multiple choice format, and is open-book with examinees permitted to use a PDF version of the MPEP. An unofficial score of 70% indicates a passing grade on the exam. Upon successful completion of the examination, one will be labeled as a &quot;patent attorney&quot; if he/she has already been admitted to a state or territorial bar. However, engineers, scientists and any other science-based majors, as well as law students and law graduates who are not admitted to a bar, will be labeled as &quot;patent agents&quot; since they cannot give legal advice nor represent clients in court. The latest exam result statistics are for the 2014 fiscal year, when 2,799 exams were administered with 42.8% resulting in passing scores. The pass rate has dropped noticeably since the provisions of the America Invents Act, implemented in March 2013, were first included in the exam. For example, from June 9, 2005, through October 17, 2006, 58.2% of the 4,165 candidates passed the exam, which was based upon MPEP, 8th Edition, Revision 2. The current exam is based mostly on MPEP, 9th Edition, Revision 08.2017, as of August 16, 2018. Applicants who are not United States citizens and do not reside in the U.S. are not eligible for registration except as permitted by 37 CFR § 11.6(c). None of the world&#x27;s countries except Canada reciprocates, giving U.S. citizens the right that the U.S. grants to their citizens. However, the Canadian Intellectual Property Office does not grant U.S. patent practitioners the same privileges the USPTO grants Canadian patent agents.

A patent practitioner needs an adequate understanding of technology to understand a client&#x27;s invention and it is generally helpful for applicants to have a scientific or technical background. Patent lawyers must be capable of understanding the technical and scientific aspects of patents and patent applications.

There are three categories of qualification, through which an applicant for the patent bar may demonstrate the scientific and technical training necessary to provide valuable service to patent applicants:
*Category A: bachelor&#x27;s degree in a required technical subject. The applicant submits proof of completion of an accredited bachelor&#x27;s degree program in such academic fields as engineering, physics, pharmacology, biology, biochemistry, or computer science. It may be possible to qualify based upon a degree from an unaccredited institution, or a graduate degree in a technical field, and consideration may be given for other training and experience.
*Category B: bachelor&#x27;s degree in another subject. If an applicant does not possess a degree that qualifies the applicant to take the examination under Category A, an applicant with a bachelor&#x27;s degree must prove to the satisfaction of the OED Director that the applicant possesses scientific and technical training equivalent to that received at an accredited U.S. college or university for a bachelor&#x27;s degree in one of the subjects that is acceptable under Category A. Other training and education may be relevant to the determination of qualification for the exam.
*Category C: practical engineering or scientific experience. An applicant who relies upon practical engineering or scientific experience but does not qualify under Category A or B may establish the required technical training by submitting proof of passage of the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination (FE test), a test of engineering fundamentals. 
A candidate must also possess &quot;good moral character and reputation&quot; (37 CFR 11.7). If practicing outside the United States, a patent practitioner must be a U.S. citizen.

<text>Rex Morgan, M.D. is an American soap opera comic strip, created May 10, 1948 by psychiatrist Dr. Nicholas P. Dallis under the pseudonym Dal Curtis.

== History ==
The name for the strip was inspired by the real life Rex S. Morgan Sr., the U.S. Army&#x27;s &quot;chief mortician&quot; and a popular Philadelphia TV personality in the 1960s. The strip&#x27;s look and content was influenced by the work of Allen Saunders and Ken Ernst on &quot;Mary Worth&quot;.

Initially syndicated by Publishers Syndicate and then by Field Newspaper Syndicate, &quot;Rex Morgan, M.D.&quot; is now at King Features Syndicate. A 1952 attempt to create a TV series starring Louis Heyward was unsuccessful, with the pilot never shown.

== Story and characters ==
The story centers on Dr. Rex Morgan, who in 1948 moves to the fictional small town of Glenwood to take over a late friend&#x27;s practice. Helping him grapple with a dizzying array of medical problems is his old friend&#x27;s office manager and nurse, June Gale. Morgan and Gale collaborated in resolving the medical and emotional problems of patients and friends over the years. Among their patients was feisty elder Melissa Clairidge, introduced in 1951. She was not used after 2012 except for a flashback story in 2020. Rex&#x27;s former classmate Keith Cavell was introduced in 1957 and starred in occasional story lines until he was killed off in 1995. Young Dr. Brice Adam sometimes had a story to himself from 1970 to 1978, for example in a situation which saw him taken hostage by two felons who had meningitis.

Rex and June married in 1995. They introduced their first child, a daughter named Sarah Ann Morgan, on February 22, 2000. Their second child, Michael Dallis Morgan, was introduced on 29 November 2015, and an adopted child, Johnny, joined the family in 2018. Rex and June now operate their own free clinic. They have two dogs.

The strip has long been praised for its blunt tackling of social issues and taboo subjects, such as drug abuse, domestic violence, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, diabetes, organ transplants, adoption and sexual harassment. The story&#x27;s constant realism about these issues has led groups such as the Leahy Foundation to use &quot;Rex Morgan&quot; as a teaching tool. In the case of the Leahy Foundation, the strip has been used to teach their students about epilepsy at Harvard University. Some issues, particularly in the strip&#x27;s early years, proved too controversial. In 1950, the &quot;Newark News&quot; refused to run one series in which a nurse tried to euthanize her sick father. The paper wrote that the sequences &quot;dealt with an attempted mercy killing and had no place on this comic page.&quot;

Dallis claimed he created the strip to inform the general public about medical issues in an entertaining manner. For instance, a continuity from 1970 depicted the plight of an attractive young woman who frequently experienced gaps of &quot;missing time&quot;: Morgan diagnosed her as suffering from &quot;petit mal&quot;. In later years, the story plots moved away from medical themes as Rex and June alternated in stories, confronting threats and danger from a variety of malfeasants. A popular story took place in 2006, in which longtime character Dr. Troy Gainer was revealed to be a fraud. Beginning in 2016, artist-writer Terry Beatty often put Rex back in medical settings, either at his clinic or in the hospital. Beatty also had Morgan tackle pseudoscience in the form of a scam perpetrated by recurring con artist René Belluso, as discussed in a 2019 interview in Skeptical Inquirer.

In 2019, the strip introduced Marti, a friend of Sarah&#x27;s with Down syndrome.

In January 2022 Belluso returned, threatening a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Sarah (who allegedly committed intellectual theft involving characters Belluso said he created) in a bid to get revenge against Rex for his part in ending Belluso&#x27;s pseudoscience scam. On the 30th, attorney Barry Stuhr was introduced.

==Artists and writers==
Dallis died in July 1991. Woody Wilson became the writer. His name appeared in September 1991. From 1948 to 1978, the strip was drawn by Marvin Bradley, with backgrounds by John Frank Edgington. Edgington retired in 1976. Their team was succeeded from 1979 to 1981 by former &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; assistant Frank Springer. Fernando Da Silva briefly took over the strip in 1982, then in 1983 Tony DiPreta became the main artist. On 19 June 2000, long-time DC Comics artist Graham Nolan began a 13-year stint. On 30 December 2013, Terry Beatty made his debut as the strip&#x27;s artist. In spring 2016 Wilson left and Beatty became the writer.

Uncredited assistants during the 1970s included Fran Matera, Alex Kotzky and André LeBlanc. With the changes in artists, the character have been known to change appearance. With Nolan&#x27;s art first appearing in 2000, a complete overhaul of the characters&#x27; physical appearances was seen. When Beatty became artist at the end of 2013, he redesigned the characters in his own way.

==Pop culture references==
In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, Homer Simpson is reading the funny pages and comments, &quot;Ah, &quot;Rex Morgan, M.D.&quot;, you have the prescription for the daily blues.&quot;

Cartoonist Bill Watterson occasionally drew his syndicated newspaper comic strip &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; in the realistic style of &quot;Rex Morgan, M.D.&quot;, when depicting six-year-olds Calvin and Susie playing &quot;house.&quot;

<text>Julius Friedrich Heinrich Abegg (23 March 1796 – 29 May 1868) was a German criminalist.
== Life ==

Abegg was born in Erlangen as the son of the Reformed preacher Dr. Johannes Wilhelm Abegg (1768–1806), who later moved to Königsberg in Prussia to become councillor of the consistory, superintendent and later chaplain of the Court. Julius Abegg was educated at the &quot;Ecole Française&quot; and the German-Polish College in Königsberg, later at the colleges of Erlangen and Nuremberg. 
At the age of 17, he went to the University of Erlangen to study law. He continued his studies in Heidelberg and Landshut, where he earned his doctorate.

Before lecturing, he went to practise his studies at the regional court of Erlangen under the guidance of judge Wolfgang Puchta and professor Eduard August Feuerbach. In 1819 he went to Berlin, where he listened to Biener, Göschen, Hegel and Savigny. In 1821 he became extraordinary professor at the University of Königsberg and in 1824 regular professor. In 1826 Abegg moved to the University of Breslau, in 1833 he was awarded a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Erlangen.

In the following, he was delegate of the Prussian Regional Synod, head of the Presbyteries of the Court, curator of the Reformed College, member of the Society for the Betterment of Detainees and participated at the German Juristical Congress. He was awarded the title of Privy Judiciary Council. Abegg died in Breslau.

== Theories ==

Julius Abegg was advocate for and founder of the &quot;Theory of Equitableness&quot;. In this theory the punishment is to be based on equitableness and should cancel with the breach of the law. Equitableness alone decides on the precondition, the degree and the manner of a punishment, yet taking into account the motives of the accused. 
While the act of the crime and the punishment are as such not comparable, cultural and temporal customs can provide values for their comparison. If the punishment is determined according to these ideas, it would provide retribution of the deed, the criminal&#x27;s right of a just penalty, deterrence of others and protection of society.

The aspect of retribution for the deed may be the reason that Abegg was also an advocate for death penalty. In a review he states that for him death penalty is not a revenge, not violence against a crime - &quot;no, it shall be the revocation of the wrong, highly personified, so that it can not persist anymore without objection&quot;. He attributes a life an unlimited value, so that a death becomes the unlimited evil.

== Publications ==

<text>Beijing&#x27;s 5th Ring Road (, China Road Numbering: S50 (Beijing) is a ring road encircling the city about away from the city centre. It takes the form of an expressway and is in length. Being a ring road, it has no natural start or end point, although the &quot;0 km&quot; mark is found near the northeastern stretch at Laiguangying, at the intersection with the Jingcheng Expressway. The expressway ring road is a provincial-level road in Beijing municipality.

All of Beijing&#x27;s expressways, except for the Tongyan Expressway, are interlinked with the 5th Ring Road.

Portions of the expressway have a maximum speed limit of 90 km/h, with the remainder imposing a speed limit of 100 km/h. There is a universal minimum speed limit of 50 km/h.

The 5th ring road has three lanes in each direction, for a total of six lanes.

==History==
The route was originally called the &quot;1st Expressway Ring Road&quot;, as it would take the form of an expressway, and therefore become the city&#x27;s first expressway ring road. However, given the fact that the 2nd Ring Road, 3rd Ring Road and 4th Ring Road were in existence, re-ordering it as a ring road with a number value of 1, especially as it was &quot;outside&quot; the 4th Ring Road, looked odd. Therefore, it was renamed the 5th Ring Road, after some debate.

Work began soon after and the first portion of the ring road opened in 2001, linking the Badaling Expressway with the Airport Expressway. Further stretches of the road were soon opened. By mid-2003, half of the ring road was open, from the western end connecting the West Chang&#x27;an Avenue to the interchange in the southeast with the Jingjintang Expressway.

The ring road was completed in its entirety on November 1, 2003, with the intersections with the Jingshi Expressway and the Jingkai Expressway. Also completed on that same day was the Xiaoyue Tunnel—noticeable for being the only tunnel on any of the Ring Roads of Beijing.

The 5th Ring Road is home to the Shifeng Bridge. This bridge was built and actually had to be rotated after it was built to link the two ends of the southwestern 5th Ring Road together. Underneath the bridge ran several important rail lines that could not be interrupted while the bridge was being built, which made it impossible for the Shifeng Bridge to be built like a normal bridge. It was instead constructed in parts extending the expressway as it went along. The completion of this colossal work accelerated the completion of the entire ring road.

At night, the Shifeng Bridge looks spectacular. It apparently is a trademark bridge of the expressway ring road.

===Recent history===
By mid-December 2004, a second exit lane was fitted for the Wangjing Science and Technology Park exit (clockwise direction). Previously, traffic used to clog up the entire ring road (at around 6 p.m. – 7 p.m. local time every workday) near that exit, as it is very close to Wangjing. Also, a second exit liaising directly with Wangjing is under construction; it is very close to the Wangjing filling station on the ring road (clockwise direction again).

==Tolls==
When the 5th Ring Road was completed (and even while segments were already open to the traffic), the expressway became a toll ring road. The charge was 0.5 CNY per kilometre as a minimum for small vehicles (which would equate to just around 6 cents U.S.).

The charge, although small, was exorbitant for many drivers, who shied away from the expressway. Further protests derived from the apparent fact that drivers were being charged the full CNY 5 for just &quot;one kilometre&quot; of the road, from Yizhuang to the Jingjintang Expressway. Additionally, users of the Badaling Expressway and the Jingkai Expressway, which have toll gates within the 5th Ring Road, moaned about being charged twice – once for the 5th Ring Road, and once again for the expressway connecting the ring road.

Beijingers soon learned to avoid this pricey path at all costs, preferring to sit out hours in jams on the 4th Ring Road and roads more central to Beijing. Thus, the 5th Ring Road became a virtually &quot;wasted&quot; ring expressway. As a result, this expressway was the subject of a heated debate in 2003. It became apparent that the 5th Ring Road was made just for those who could afford both the petrol &quot;and&quot; the tolls. Meanwhile, it became a kind of an unofficial test track for new drivers, who racked up spectacular (and, strictly speaking, illegal) speeds on the nearly empty expressway.

With Shoufa, the company running the expressway, unwilling to budge, standing firm to its view that the prices were authorised by the local Price Bureau, and with enough disgruntled Beijingers posting on message boards demanding the removal of the tolls, the authorities stepped in at the end of December 2003 and decreed that the road be made free on the first day of 2004. (At the same time, all charges for expressway exits within the confines of the 5th Ring Road were also done away with.) When the tolls were removed, usage of the 5th Ring Road gradually increased. The ring road previously managed with only 10% of its total designed capacity.

The expressway ring road, even without the charges, remains uncrowded today, except for any occurrence of a serious accident.

The sole remaining toll is located at Shangqing Bridge.

==Traffic jams==
The section from Wufang Bridge to Shangqing Bridge in both directions has a moderate to high risk of traffic jams due to its proximity to important residential districts and tourist destinations, such as Wangjing, Beiyuan, and Yayuncun. This section has, unusually, a much higher risk for congestion than the 4th Ring Road (both directions) during rush hour, despite the section past the Wuyuan Bridge (inner ring direction) having a speed limit of 100 km/h and the expressway being more distant from the city centre.

<doc id="743818" wikidata="Q7833875" url="?curid=743818" title="Transcendental theology">
<text>&quot;Transcendental theology&quot; () is a term invented by Immanuel Kant to describe a method of discerning theological concepts. Kant divided transcendental theology into &quot;ontotheology&quot; and cosmotheology, both of which he also invented, &quot;in order to distinguish between two competing types of &#x27;transcendental theology&#x27;&quot;.

Kant defined the relationship between ontotheology and cosmotheology as follows: 

&quot;Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology.&quot;
A critique of transcendental theology as developed by Kant is that it is argued that human reason is not capable of proving God&#x27;s existence. Kant solves this problem by appealing to moral symbolism. Thus, Kant describes God as a moral trinity: holy lawgiver, good governor, and just judge.

<doc id="743821" wikidata="Q1814703" url="?curid=743821" title="Minerva (automobile)">
<text>Minerva was a Belgian firm active from 1902 to 1938 and a manufacturer of luxury automobiles. The company became defunct in 1956.

Founded by Dutchman Sylvain de Jong, the company initially produced safety bicycles before branching out into light cars and motorized bicycles in 1900. By 1902, Minerva added cars to its lineup. The brand achieved fame due to the quality and quietness of its Knight Engines and was favored by royalty and influential people like Henry Ford. Despite success, financial struggles during the 1930s led to its merger with Impéria Automobiles, another Belgian manufacturer.

After World War II, Minerva produced a version of the Land Rover under license for the Belgian army until 1954. A fallout with Land Rover and subsequent court case led to the end of this partnership. The company made attempts to re-enter the car market, but ceased operations in 1956.

==History==
In 1883, a young Dutchman, Sylvain de Jong (1868–1928) settled in Antwerp, Belgium.

===Bicycles and motorcycles===

Minerva started out manufacturing standard safety bicycles in 1897, before in 1900 expanding into light cars and &quot;motocyclettes&quot;, particularly motorized bicycles which were a forerunner of motorcycles.

They produced lightweight clip-on engines that mounted below the bicycle front down tube, specifically for Minerva bicycles, but also available in kit form suitable for almost any bicycle. The engine drove a belt turning a large gear wheel attached to the side of the rear wheel opposite to the chain. By 1901 the kit engine was a 211cc unit developing 1.5 hp, comfortably cruising at at 1,500 rpm, capable of a top speed of , and getting fuel consumption in the range of . These kits were exported around the world to countries including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, and other British territories of the time.

As engine power increased, frame ruptures became increasingly common, and by 1903 Minerva had developed an in-frame design for their bicycles, with the engine mounted above the bottom bracket, while still also offering the clip-on kit. From 1904 Minerva began focusing more on car production, and while development and production of the Minerva motorized bicycles and motorcycles continued through to about 1909, they increasingly became a less significant part of the company.

Minerva engines exported to the UK powered the very first Triumph, among others. 
Motorcycle production would continue until 1909 or 1914, and during this period Minerva became one of the world&#x27;s premier names in motorcycles and motorcycle engines. (For instance Chater-Lea produced Minerva-engines in the UK.)

===Automobiles===


In 1902 De Jong added cars to his production as well with a 6 hp four-cylinder model. In 1903 he founded &quot;Société Anonyme Minerva Motors&quot; in Berchem (Antwerp). Volume car production began in 1904 with a range of two-, three- and four-cylinder models with chain drive and metal clad wooden chassis and the &quot;Minervette&quot; cyclecar. The 8-litre &quot;Kaiserpreis&quot; won the Belgian Circuit des Ardennes race in 1907.

Charles S Rolls (of future Rolls-Royce fame) was a Minerva dealer in England selling the 2.9-litre . The most important market for the manufacturer remained England, where at £105 the small 636 cc single-cylinder &quot;Minervette&quot; was the cheapest car on the market, followed by the Netherlands and France.

In 1908, Minerva obtained a worldwide Knight Engine license. The Knight motor, developed by Charles Yale Knight in the United States, used double sleeve valves and ran almost silently. All future Minervas would use these engines. Sporting successes continued with the new engines including the Austrian Alpine Trials and Swedish Winter Trials. Customers for the Minerva would include kings of Belgium, Sweden and Norway, Henry Ford and the Impressionist Artist Anna Boch.

During World War I Sylvain de Jong and his engineers were based in Amsterdam where they maintained development of their automobiles. Minerva cars were used for hit and run attacks against the Germans initially with rifle fire and light machine guns from simply protected open topped vehicles. These vehicles became increasingly sophisticated until trench warfare robbed them of the mobility needed for their hit and run tactics.

In 1920, they returned to Belgium to restart the production of luxury cars with the &quot;20CV&quot; 3.6-litre four-cylinder and &quot;30CV&quot; 5.3-litre six-cylinder models. The manufacturer&#x27;s star rose not only in Europe, but in the United States as well where American film stars, politicians and industrialists appreciated the cars. The Minerva had the same quality as the Rolls-Royce, but was slightly less expensive.
Due to the success, in 1922 a second factory apart from the primary one in Berchem was built in Mortsel for coachbuilding.
In 1923, smaller models were introduced; the 2-litre four-cylinder &quot;15CV&quot; and 3.4-litre six-cylinder &quot;20CV&quot; with standard four-wheel brakes. In 1927, the &quot;30CV&quot; was replaced with the 6-litre &quot;AK&quot; and also a new 2-litre six, the &quot;12-14&quot;, was introduced. Large cars continued to be a specialty of Minerva&#x27;s, and in 1930 the then almost-compulsory-for-the-time straight eight was introduced in two sizes; the 6.6-litre &quot;AL&quot; and the 4-litre &quot;AP&quot;. The last Minerva was the 2-litre &quot;M4&quot; of 1934 but it did not sell well.
===1930s crisis and restructuring===
With the financial crisis in the 1930s, the company was restructured as Société Nouvelle Minerva but in 1934 merged with the other major Belgian manufacturer Impéria Automobiles. Impéria continued to make Minervas for a year and the &quot;AP&quot; until 1938 and from 1937 badged some of their cars and trucks for export to England and France as Minerva-Impérias. Just before the outbreak of the war, a group of businessmen from Verviers bought out Minerva.

===Land Rover production===

After World War II the company produced a version of the Land Rover 80&quot; under licence for the Belgian army up to 1954. The 80&quot; model was known as the TT (Tout Terrain). A smaller number of licence built Land Rover 86&quot; were built from late 1953 to 1956. These vehicles had locally built steel bodywork. Some civilian sales of both the 80&quot; and the 86&quot; models were achieved. A number of Land Rover vehicles were also assembled for the Belgian state police (Gendarmerie / Rijkswacht). The Rijkswacht vehicles had the more traditional aluminium bodywork and front wing shape associated with Land Rover vehicles. A bitter dispute broke out between Land Rover and the Minerva company and this led to a court case, won by Minerva for breach of contract. This was the death knell of the partnership and licence arrangement. After the deal with Land Rover fell apart there were plans to re-enter the car market but these did not get beyond the prototype stage. The company struggled for survival and made the Continental-engined Land Rover-like &quot;C20&quot; until 1956.

===Name revival in 2013===
In 2013, a concept car was presented with the name Minerva J.M. Brabazon. This was a drawing only.

<text>Creighton University () is a private research university in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. Founded by the Society of Jesus in 1878, the university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. In 2015 the university enrolled 8,393 graduate and undergraduate students on a campus just outside of downtown Omaha. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. It comprises nine undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools and colleges, including a law school, medical school, dental school, pharmacy school, nursing school, and business school. The university operates the Creighton University Medical Center. It has a second campus focused on health sciences located in Phoenix, Arizona.

== History ==
The university was founded as Creighton College on September 2, 1878, through a gift from Mary Lucretia Creighton, who stipulated in her will that a school be established in memory of her husband, prominent Omaha businessman Edward Creighton. The college began with 120 students, taught by five Jesuits and two lay teachers. Edward&#x27;s brother, John A. Creighton, is credited with fostering and sustaining the university&#x27;s early growth and endowment. In 1878, the College of Arts and Sciences was established, and remains the largest college today. Shortly after, in 1885, the Creighton University Observatory was built on campus. Women were first admitted in 1913. In 1958, the college split into Creighton Preparatory Schools and Creighton University.

<text>K-R-I-T (or simply &quot;Krit&quot;) was a small automobile manufacturing company (1909–1916) based in Detroit, Michigan.

==History==

Krit Motor Car Company&#x27;s name probably originated from Kenneth Crittenden, who provided financial backing and helped design the cars. The emblem of the cars was a swastika (a symbol that was not yet associated with Nazism, Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, or antisemitism).

Krit occupied two different sites during its history: the first one it took over from the Blomstrom car, and in 1911 moved to the works that had been used by R. M. Owen &amp; Company who had moved to become Owen Magnetic.

In 1911 the KRIT Motor Company was purchased by Walter S Russel of the Russel Wheel and Foundry Company.

The cars were conventional 4-cylinder models and many were exported to Europe and Australia. In 1913 a six-cylinder car was introduced and Krit tried to increase sales by engineering cars for other marques. The outbreak of World War I seriously damaged the company and it failed in 1915. A few cars were subsequently assembled from remaining parts.

<text>The American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) is an international professional society devoted to agricultural and biological engineering. It was founded in December 1907 at the University of Wisconsin–Madison as the American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE) and is now based in St. Joseph, Michigan. Today the organization has about 9,000 members in over 100 countries. ASABE serves many functions: it provides a forum for communication of research findings through conferences, scientific journals, and a magazine; it develops standards of practice; it provides opportunities for members to network. It cooperates with the Alpha Epsilon honor society.

After years of debate, members of the organization voted in 2005 to modify the name to better reflect the changes in the profession. For many years, the discipline had broadened to include engineering for biological systems, and the name change simply reflected this reality. Most of the university departments of agricultural engineering had already changed their names. The increase in biological engineering led to a number of breakthroughs that greatly affected the global agriculture system of modern society. Genetically modified organisms for instance have led to massive overhauls in food production, logistics and trade.

ASABE is the lead society in ABET evaluation for agricultural and biological academic program evaluation in the United States. It is a cooperating society for bioengineering/biomedical, environmental engineering and healthcare engineering technology.

ASABE encourages engineering excellence through professional licensure. The society&#x27;s committee on licensure maintains and enhances the professionalism of the members of ASABE by providing services related to the national Principles and Practices Examination (PE Exam) for agricultural and biological engineering.

Organization

ASABE comprises eight technical communities that advance the mission of the organization through publishing, continuing professional development, and standards development:
Applied Science and Engineering
Energy Systems
Ergonomics, Safety, and Health
Information Technology, Sensors, and Control Systems
Machinery Systems
Natural Resources and Environment Systems
Plant, Animal and Facility Systems
Processing Systems

Since 2020, the Society has launched two major initiatives:

The Alliance for Moderninzing African Agrifood Systems presents a holistic approach to accelerate improvements in the food-crop value chains in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The Circular Bioeconomy Systems Institute is advancing the circular transformation with unique expertise that allows ASABE members and partners to build across systems. 

Publications
The society publishes four peer-reviewed journals:
Journal of the ASABE
Applied Engineering in Agriculture 
Journal of Agricultural Safety and Health
Journal of Natural Resources and Agricultural Ecosystems

<text>The Jingtong Expressway () is an expressway with express road characteristics in Beijing which links the central Chaoyang District to Tongzhou District. At present, it is approximately in length.

For most of the expressway, the Batong line of Beijing Subway, an extension of Line 1, sits near the centre of the expressway, linking central Beijing to Tuqiao on the Eastern 6th Ring Road, beyond central Tongzhou.

Some universities sit right next to the expressway, including Communication University of China.

==Route==
The Jingtong Expressway runs entirely within the confines of the municipality of Beijing.

Basic Route: Beijing (Dawang Bridge - Sihui - Gaobeidian - Shuangqiao - Huicun - Tongzhou District)

==History==

The Jingtong expressway was the first highway project built under Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) scheme in China. The project was awarded to Lin Tung-Yen China with a 20-year concession period (1996–2016). The expressway was opened to the public in 1996.

In December 2004, a plan was unveiled to local media to interlink the 2.5 km of non-expressway between the Jingtong and Jingha expressways with an express road connection, eliminating traffic bottlenecks between Ximazhuang and Beiguan Roundabout. This link finally opened in December 2006, with the remaining bits and pieces of additional roadworks finishing in early 2007.

==Major Exits==
Sihui, Gaobeidian, Shuangqiao, Huicun, Tongzhou District

==Connections==

Ring Roads of Beijing: Connects with the E. 4th Ring Road at Sihui and the E. 5th Ring Road at Yuantong Bridge.

Jingha Expressway: Section heading for Shanhaiguan links with Jingha Expressway after the Tongzhou Beiguan Roundabout.

<text>Batu, officially the City of Batu (, ), is a city in the East Java Province of Indonesia. It is about 20 km to the northwest of Malang. Formerly, it was a part of Malang Regency; but in June 2001, Batu became an independent city (by Act No. 11 of 2001), with its own mayor and council.

With a population of 213,046 people at the 2020 Census, which rose to 221,714 as officially estimated as of mid-2023 (comprising 111,390 males and 110,324 females), Batu lies on the southern slopes of Mount Arjuno-Welirang. Its population largely consists of Javanese. The town used to be a recreation place for the Dutch colonial officers in the Dutch colonial area (before 1945). &quot;Batu&quot; means &quot;rock&quot; in Indonesian.

==History==
Since the 10th century, the area of Batu and its surroundings has been known as a resting place for the royal family, because the region is a mountainous area with comfortable air, also supported by the beauty of natural scenery as a characteristic of mountainous regions.

During the reign of the Mataram Kingdom under King Sindok, a royal official named Mpu Supo was ordered by the King to build a royal family resting place in the mountains with nearby water springs. With a hard effort, finally Mpu Supo discovered an area that is now better known as the tourist area of Songgoriti. With the approval of King Sindok, Mpu Supo began to build the Songgoriti area as a royal family retreat and built a temple named Supo Temple.

Some local community leaders said that the title Batu comes from the name of a cleric follower of Prince Diponegoro named Abu Ghonaim referred to as the Kyai Gubug Angin which later the local community was familiar with calling &quot;Mbah Wastu&quot;. From Javanese cultural habits that often shorten and shorten the designation of someone&#x27;s name which is considered too long, also to make it shorter and faster when calling someone, finally Mbah Wastu is called &quot;Mbah Tu&quot; to be &quot;Mbatu&quot; or &quot;Batu&quot; as a term used for a mild climate city in East Java.

The history of Abu Ghonaim&#x27;s existence as a forerunner and person known as a community leader who started the &quot;babad alas&quot; which was used as an inspiration from the designation of the Batu region. Abu Ghonaim was from the Central Java region. Abu Ghonaim as a loyal follower of Prince Diponegoro, intentionally left his native area of Central Java and moved to the hillside of Mount Panderman to avoid the pursuit and arrest of the Dutch soldiers (&quot;Kompeni&quot;). Abu Ghonaim or Mbah Wastu started his new life together with the surrounding community. Finally, many residents and surrounding communities and other communities came around the residence of Mbah Wastu. Initially, they lived in a group (community) in the Bumiaji, Sisir and Temas.

==Geography==

The city of Batu lies on the slopes of several mountains. The most prominent are Mount Anjasmoro (2,277 m), Mount Arjuno (3,339 m), Mount Welirang (3,156 m), Mount Banyak (1,306 m), Mount Kawi (2,551 m), Mount Panderman (2,045 m), Mount Semeru (3.676 m), and Mount Wukir (335 m). 

In the 19th century, the Dutch East Indies government developed Batu as a mountain resort. Villas and resort facilities were built in Batu during the period. Most of the topography of Batu City is dominated by highland and hilly terrain with valleys running down mountain slopes. In northern Batu, there is a dense forest, Raden Soerjo Forest Park, which is a protected forest area. 

Most soils in Batu city are andosols, sequentially present with cambisol, latosol and alluvial. These form mechanical soils which contain substantial amounts of minerals coming from volcanic eruptions. These soils tend to be very fertile.

Batu is a near-exact antipode (or polar opposite) to the city of San Fernando de Apure, Venezuela. 

=== Climate ===
The climate in Batu city at lower elevation (700-900 meters) features tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;), and at higher elevation (900-1800 meters), the city&#x27;s climate is classified by Köppen as subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;). The driest month is August with a total precipitation of , while the wettest month is January with a total precipitation of . The temperature is moderated by the altitude, as the city is located at an average of above sea level. The hottest month is October with an average of , while the coolest month is August with an average of .
==Administration==
The city is divided into three districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the numbers of administrative villages (urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;) in each district, and its postal codes.

The districts are further subdivided into 24 urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;). The names of the urban villages are:
;Batu District

<text>In mycology, a universal veil is a temporary membranous tissue that fully envelops immature fruiting bodies of certain gilled mushrooms. The developing Caesar&#x27;s mushroom (&quot;Amanita caesarea&quot;), for example, which may resemble a small white sphere at this point, is protected by this structure. The veil will eventually rupture and disintegrate by the force of the expanding and maturing mushroom, but will usually leave evidence of its former shape with remnants. These remnants include the volva, or cup-like structure at the base of the stipe, and patches or &quot;warts&quot; on top of the cap. This macrofeature is useful in wild mushroom identification because it is an easily observed, taxonomically significant feature. It is a character present among species of basidiomycete fungi belonging to the genera &quot;Amanita&quot; and &quot;Volvariella&quot;. This has particular importance due to the disproportionately high number of potentially lethal species contained within the former genus.

A membrane enveloping immature fruiting bodies of gasteroid fungi resembles a universal veil, but is called a &quot;peridium&quot;.

<doc id="743870" wikidata="Q1242458" url="?curid=743870" title="Peterborough Chronicle">
<text>The Peterborough Chronicle (also called the Laud manuscript and the E manuscript) is a version of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicles&quot; originally maintained by the monks of Peterborough Abbey, now in Cambridgeshire. It contains unique information about the history of England and of the English language after the Norman Conquest; according to philologist J. A. W. Bennett, it is the only prose history in English between the Conquest and the later 14th century.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicles&quot; were composed and maintained between the various monasteries of Anglo-Saxon England and were an attempt to record the history of Britain throughout the years AD. Typically the chronicles began with the birth of Christ, went through Biblical and Roman history, then continued to the present. Every major religious house in England kept its own, individual chronicle, and the chronicles were not compared with each other or in any way kept uniform. For example, in the opening paragraph of this chronicle it is said that the Britons that settled in South Britain came from &quot;Armenia&quot;. (&quot;Armenia&quot; is probably a mistaken transcription of Armorica, an area in Northwestern Gaul.) However, whenever a monastery&#x27;s chronicle was damaged, or when a new monastery began a chronicle, nearby monasteries would lend out their chronicles for copying. Thus, a new chronicle would be identical to the lender&#x27;s until they reached the date of copying and then would be idiosyncratic. Such was the case with the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot;: a fire compelled the abbey to copy the chronicles from other churches up to 1120.

When William the Conqueror took England and Anglo-Norman became the official language, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicles&quot; generally ceased. The monks of Peterborough Abbey, however, continued to compile events in theirs. While the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot; is not professional history, and one still needs Latin histories (e.g. William of Malmesbury&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot;), it is one of the few surviving first-hand accounts from the period 1070 to 1154 in England written in English and from a non-courtly point of view.

It is also a valuable source of information about the early Middle English language itself. The first continuation, for example, is written in late Old English, but the second continuation begins to show mixed forms, until the conclusion of the second continuation, which switches into an early form of distinctly Middle English. The linguistic novelties recorded in the second continuation are plentiful, including at least one true innovation: the feminine pronoun &quot;she&quot; (as &quot;scæ&quot;) is first recorded in the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot; ().

The chronicle from the original copied text through the continuations shows the history of the loss of grammatical gender in West Saxon English, going from the copied portion which while mostly conforming to Old English grammatical gender does have some discrepancies, through the first continuation in which modifiers are re-adapted to other functions and there is a large discrepancy with Old English grammatical gender, to the second continuation in which grammatical gender is completely lost or nearly so.

==The fire and the continuations==

Today, the &quot;Peterborough Chronicle&quot; is recognised as one of the four distinct versions of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (along with the &quot;Winchester Chronicle&quot; or &quot;Parker Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Abingdon Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Worcester Chronicle&quot;), but it is not wholly distinct (). There was a fire at Peterborough (Friday, 4 August 1116) that destroyed the monastery&#x27;s library, and so the earliest part of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; at Peterborough is a copy of Winchester Cathedral&#x27;s chronicle (). For the 11th century, the chronicle at Peterborough diverges from Parker&#x27;s, and it has been speculated that a proto-&quot;Kentish Chronicle&quot;, full of nationalistic and regionalistic interests, was used for these years; however, such a single source is speculative (). The Peterborough copyists probably used multiple sources for their missing years, but the Dissolution of the Monasteries makes it impossible to be sure. Regardless, the entries for the 12th century to 1122 are a jumble of other chronicles&#x27; accounts, sharing half-entries with one source and half with another, moving from one source to another and then back to a previous one. This shifting back and forth raises, again, the vexatious possibility of a lost chronicle as a single, common source.

It is after 1122 that the Peterborough manuscript becomes unique. Therefore, the document usually called &quot;The Peterborough Chronicle&quot; is divided into the &quot;&quot;first continuation&quot; and the &quot;second continuation&quot;&quot; from the time of the fire and the copying. The two continuations are &quot;sui generis&quot; both in terms of the information they impart, the style they employ, and their language. The first continuation covers 1122–1131. The second continuation runs from 1132 to 1154 and includes the reign of King Stephen.

The copied portion uses grammatical gender and inflections like in Old English, but there are discrepancies.

===First continuation (1122–1131)===

Although the second continuation holds the most importance, the first continuation has unique records of events in the Peterborough area and provides an insight into ordinary people&#x27;s lives. The first continuation records the Conquest, the incursion of Sweyn of Denmark, and rumours of other turbulence about the throne. However, it has no evidence at all for Saxon opposition and rebellion against William and his sons. An arguably eyewitness account describes the burning of Peterborough Abbey itself, due to the drunkenness of the monks. It also covers ecclesiastical scandals, such as the Abbot of Glastonbury bringing in mercenaries to control his religious house. Further, there is a significant change in language from the previous late Old English that begins with the entry for the years 1122–1131, with mixtures of Old English and Middle English vocabulary (and increasing Gallic formations) and syntax (a simplification of the pronouns and strong verbs, as well as a decrease in the declensions of the nouns).

Both the first and second continuation authors have sympathy for the common man. As Bennett suggests, Peterborough is the one source for compassion of the laity found in contemporary accounts. The first continuation expresses as much outrage at the hanging of forty-four thieves in 1122, some of whom were innocent, as at the burning of the monastery at Gloucester. The monastic author suggests that taxes were too high, putting the impoverished villagers in a dilemma of stealing or starving. Therefore, the nobles were guilty of a double sin. First, they executed the innocent and used excessive cruelty with the guilty. Second, it was at least as sinful for the nobles to compel theft with their avarice as for the poor to steal for bread. When the Norman king, Henry I of England foisted his kinsman upon Peterborough as abbot (he was already abbot of Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély), the chronicler protests at some length at the illegality and impiety of the appointment. He also mentions that the Wild Hunt was seen at the same time as the appointment, as an ill omen. When Henry was eventually removed by death, the monk again takes the position that this was divine remedy, for Henry had tried to make Peterborough part of the Cluniac Order and had attempted to have his own nephew be the next abbot, &quot;oc Crist it ne uuolde&quot; (&quot;but Christ did not will it&quot;).

The first continuation shows a major change in grammatical gender and inflections from how they were used in Old English. Though there are still three genders - masculine, feminine, and neuter - several nouns seem to have been shuffled among the categories in a manner that cannot be completely explained by a move towards natural gender or the gender of French nouns, as the inflections marking gender are re-purposed for other functions.

===Second continuation (1132–1154)===

The second, or final, continuation is remarkable for being in one authorial voice, and it relates the events of The Anarchy in England. Scholars speculate that the second continuation is dictated (because the language may reflect a version of early Middle English that scholars place later than Stephen and Matilda) or written as the recollections of a single elderly monk. It is a highly moving account of torture, fear, confusion, and starvation.

Henry I died in 1135, and Stephen and Matilda both had a claim to the throne. The monastic author describes the rebellion of the barons against Stephen, the escape of Matilda, and the tortures that the soldiers of the baronial powers inflicted upon the people. The author blames Stephen for the Anarchy for being &quot;soft and good&quot; when firmness and harshness were needed. When Stephen captured the rebelling barons, he let them go if they swore allegiance. According to the author,
:&quot;Þa the suikes undergæton ðat he milde man was and softe and god, and na iustise ne dide, þa diden hi alle wunder&quot; (1137)
:: (&quot;When the traitors understood that he (Stephen) was a gentle man, and soft and good, and did not execute justice, they committed all manner of atrocity.&quot;)

The barons then attempted to raise money as quickly as they could. They needed money and manpower to build castles (which the author regards as novel and rare), and so they robbed everyone they met:
:&quot;æuric rice man his castles makede and agænes him heolden; and fylden þe land ful of castles. Hi suencten suyðe þe uurecce men of þe land mid castelweorces; þa þe castles uuaren maked, þa fylden hi mid deoules and yuele men. Þa namen hi þa men þe hi wendan ðat ani god hefden, bathe be nihtes and be dæies, carlmen and wimmen, and diden heom in prisun and pined heom efter gold and syluer untellendlice pining; for ne uuaeren naeure nan martyrs swa pined alse hi waeron.&quot;
:: (&quot;Every chieftain made castles and held them against the king; and they filled the land full of castles. They viciously oppressed the poor men of the land with castle-building work; when the castles were made, then they filled the land with devils and evil men. Then they seized those who had any goods, both by night and day, working men and women, and threw them into prison and tortured them for gold and silver with uncountable tortures, for never was there a martyr so tortured as these men were.&quot;)

The monastic author sympathises with the average farmer and artisan and talks about the devastation suffered by the countryside. He is outraged by the accounts of torture he relates and laments,
:&quot;Me henged up bi the fet and smoked heom mid ful smoke. Me henged bi the þumbes other bi the hefed and hengen bryniges on her fet. Me dide cnotted strenges abuton here hæued and uurythen it ðat it gæde to þe haernes… I ne can ne I ne mai tellen alle þe wunder ne all þe pines ðat he diden wrecce men on þis land.&quot;
:: (&quot;One they hung by his feet and filled his lungs with smoke. One was hung up by the thumbs and another by the head and had coats of mail hung on his feet. One they put a knotted cord about his head and twisted it so that it went into the brains ... I neither can nor may recount all the atrocities nor all the tortures that they did on the wretched men of this land.&quot;)

Death and famine followed, as the farms were depleted and farmers murdered. If two or three riders came to a village, the monk said, everyone fled, for fear that they were robbers. Trade therefore came to a standstill, and those in want had no way to get supplies. Those travelling with money to purchase food would be robbed or killed along the way. The barons said that there was no God. The chronicler records that people said openly that Christ slept, along with His saints; he states that &quot;this — and more than we can say — we suffered 19 winters for our sins.&quot;

After the account of The Anarchy, the chronicler goes on to church matters. He speaks of the abbot Martin, who replaced the illegitimate Henry, as a good abbot. Martin had a new roof put on the monastery and moved the monks into a new building. He also, according to the author, recovered certain monastic lands that had been previously held &quot;by force&quot; by noblemen. Which lands these are is unclear, but they had probably been claimed by the nobles through the practice of placing younger sons in monasteries, making and revoking gifts of land, and by some early form of chantry. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; ends with a new abbot entering upon the death of Martin, an abbot named William. This abbot presumably halted the writing of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

Grammatical gender is almost completely gone, though Jones notes some authors consider the word &quot;that&quot; to still function as a neuter definite article here.

==Unique authorial voice==

The two Peterborough continuations sympathise with the poor, and this makes them almost unique in Latin or English history. They also focus more on life outside of the abbey than other &quot;Chronicles&quot;. The general &quot;Chronicle&quot; is somewhat insular. While most versions note the national events, such as a progress of the king or a change in sovereign, discussion of the countryside around the monastery is limited. Portents and omens receive coverage, but rarely do the chroniclers discuss political alliances (as the author of the second continuation does with his denunciation of the bishops who were allied with Matilda) or the legalities of monastic rule (as the author of the first continuation does in his lament over Abbot Henry). The monks who compiled the continuation at Peterborough were either consciously striking out in a new direction (perhaps under the direction of Abbot Martin) or continuing a type of chronicle that was confined to their own monastery (that was lost with the fire). It does not seem likely that Peterborough was in any sense a lax or secular monastery, as the description of drunkenness causing the fire would not have made the abbey singular in the age.

The continuations are also unique in their linguistic shifts. When copying from Winchester, they preserve the orthography and syntax of late Old English, and when they get to events for which they have no copy text the language abruptly changes to a newer form. Given that the loan would have taken place just before the continuation, the change in language reflects either a dramatic attempt at greater vernacular by the continuation authors or a significant and quick change in the language itself as Norman influences spread. Because the chronicle is in prose, the artificiality of verse form does not entail the preservation of linguistic archaisms, and historians of English can trace the beginnings of Middle English in these pages.

==History of the manuscript==

The manuscript of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; is now held by the Bodleian Library. It was donated to the library by William Laud, who was then Chancellor of Oxford University as well as Archbishop of Canterbury, on 28 June 1639. Laud included the manuscript together with a number of other documents, part of the third of a series of donations he made to the library in the years leading up to the English Civil War. It is currently identified in the library catalogue as &quot;Laud Misc. 636&quot;; previously it was designated as &quot;O. C. 1003&quot; based on the &quot;Old Catalogue&quot; by Edward Bernard. The Bodleian has made a series of images of Laud Misc 636 available.

<doc id="743874" wikidata="Q1185477" url="?curid=743874" title="Robin Roberts (baseball)">
<text>Robin Evan Roberts (September 30, 1926 – May 6, 2010) was an American Major League Baseball starting pitcher who pitched primarily for the Philadelphia Phillies (1948–1961). He spent the latter part of his career with the Baltimore Orioles (1962–1965), Houston Astros (1965–66), and Chicago Cubs (1966). Roberts was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976.

After retiring from Major League Baseball, he coached the University of South Florida college baseball team for nine seasons, leading them to six conference titles.

==Early life and education==
Roberts was born in Springfield, Illinois, the son of an immigrant Welsh coal miner. He arrived in East Lansing, Michigan as part of an Army Air Corps training program.

He attended Lanphier High School. After World War II, Roberts returned to Michigan State College to play basketball, not baseball. Roberts led the Spartans&#x27; basketball team in field-goal percentage in 1946–1947, was captain of the team during the 1946–1947 and 1949–1950 seasons, and earned three varsity letters in basketball. He wore number 17 for the Spartans. After his second season playing basketball, Roberts tried out for the Michigan State baseball team, becoming a pitcher because it was the position that coach John Kobs needed most.

After playing for Michigan State and spending his second summer playing in Vermont with the Barre–Montpelier Twin City Trojans, he was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Phillies===
Roberts made his Major League Baseball debut with the Philadelphia Phillies on June 18, 1948. In 1950, he led his Phillies, whose overall youth earned them the nickname the Whiz Kids, to their first National League pennant in 35 years. Roberts started three games in the last five days of the season, defeating the heavily favored Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field, in a pennant-deciding, season-ending, 10-inning game. This marked his 20th victory of the season, and Roberts became the Phillies&#x27; first 20-game winner since Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1917. Roberts also started Game 2 in the 1950 World Series against Allie Reynolds. He allowed two runs and ten hits in ten innings as the Phillies lost 2-1.

From 1950 to 1955, Roberts won at least 20 games each season, leading the National League in victories from 1952 to 1955. He led the National League in games started six times, in complete games and innings pitched five times, and he once pitched 28 complete games in a row, with one of those games lasting 17 innings. During his career, Roberts never walked more than 77 batters in any regular season. He helped himself with his bat, hitting 55 doubles, 10 triples, and five home runs with 103 RBIs.

Roberts&#x27; 28 wins in 1952, the year he was named the &quot;Sporting News&quot; MLB Player of the Year award, were the most in the National League since 1935, the year when Dizzy Dean won 28 games.

Although he had 28 wins in 1952, Roberts had his best season, based on a career high wins above replacement (WAR) in 1953, posting a 23–16 record and leading National League pitchers in strikeouts with 198. In a career-high innings pitched, he walked just 66 batters, and his 2.75 ERA was second in the league behind Warren Spahn&#x27;s 2.10.

One of the most memorable highlights of his career occurred on May 13, 1954, when Roberts gave up a lead-off home run to Bobby Adams of the Cincinnati Reds, then known as the Cincinnati Redlegs, but then went on to retire 27 consecutive batters to win 8–1, on a one-hit game.

Roberts consistently (11 out of 14 years) had a better winning percentage than did the Phillies in games in which he had no decision. Overall, the Phillies were 1,020–1,136 from 1948 to 1961, a winning percentage of .4731. Roberts was 234–199 in that span, for a winning percentage of .5404.
After the 1961 season, Roberts was sold to the New York Yankees, who acquired the slumping pitcher from the Phillies for slightly more than the $20,000 league waiver price.

On February 6, 1962, the Phillies announced that Roberts&#x27; uniform number 36 would be retired by the team on March 21, 1962, when the Yankees would visit Clearwater to play the Phillies in a spring training game. It was the first uniform number to be retired by the organization. Roberts started for the Yankees in the spring game, gave up four runs in three innings, and was the winning pitcher in the Yankees&#x27; 13–10 victory. He was released by the Yankees in May 1962 without having appeared in a regular-season game for the Yankees.

===Baltimore Orioles===
Roberts signed with the Baltimore Orioles on May 21, 1962. He went 42–36 with a 3.09 ERA in seasons with the Orioles.

In Roberts&#x27; final year in Baltimore, he was the first road roommate and mentor to Jim Palmer, who made his major league debut in relief of Roberts in the third inning of a 12–9 loss to the Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park on April 17, 1965. Palmer said 47 years later, &quot;Robin Roberts helped teach me even though he knew I was probably going to take his job.&quot; Dissatisfied with his new role as a spot starter and long reliever, Roberts requested his release, which was granted by the Orioles on July 27, 1965.

===Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs===
Roberts signed with the Houston Astros on August 5. He signed with the Chicago Cubs on July 13, 1966, with the additional capacity of assisting pitching coach Freddie Fitzsimmons. Roberts was also reunited with fellow Whiz Kid Curt Simmons. His final major league game was with the Cubs on September 3, 1966, at Forbes Field. He was released by the Cubs on October 3, 1966. He pitched for the Reading Phillies during 1967.

===Baseball Hall of Fame===
Roberts was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1976. Ahead of the August 1976 induction, Roberts was named honorary captain of the National League for the 1976 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, which was hosted by the Phillies at Veterans Stadium.

==University of South Florida coach==
After one season as a color commentator on Phillies broadcasts in 1976, Roberts coached the University of South Florida Bulls baseball team in Tampa, Florida, from 1977 to 1985. He led the team to its first NCAA Tournament in 1982, and won six conference titles with the Bulls. His uniform number 36 was the first to be retired by the team, and he was honored on the center field wall at the University of South Florida&#x27;s since demolished Red McEwen Field; he also is honored on the new USF Baseball Stadium.

==Other endeavors==
During the baseball off–season, Roberts toured with the Robin Roberts All–Stars basketball team. The team played against other touring squads, such as the Harlem Globetrotters.

Roberts was also the president of the Gold King Seafood Company in Philadelphia, even during his baseball career. This was central to an appearance Roberts made on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in 1957, where the panelists had to decipher what else he did besides play baseball.

==Legacy==

In his 19-season career, Roberts compiled a 286–245 record with 2,357 strikeouts, a 3.41 ERA, 305 complete games, 45 shutouts, and innings pitched in 676 games. He is second to Jamie Moyer for the major league record for home runs allowed by a pitcher (505) and holds the record for most consecutive opening day starts for the same team with 12, from 1950 to 1961.

As a hitter, Roberts posted a .167 batting average (255-for-1525) with 107 runs, 55 doubles, 10 triples, 5 home runs, 103 RBI and 135 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .967 fielding percentage.

Roberts is the only pitcher in major league history to defeat the Braves franchise in all three cities that the team has been based in: Boston, Milwaukee, and Atlanta.

Roberts&#x27;s record for home runs allowed can largely be attributed to his durability and his tendency to pitch inside the strike zone. Roberts threw innings during his 19-year career, 21st on the all-time innings pitched list. Roberts challenged hitters to put the ball in play, issuing relatively few walks (1.7 per 9 innings pitched) and strikeouts (4.5 per 9 innings pitched).

In 1962, the Philadelphia Phillies honored Roberts with the retirement of his uniform number, 36.

In 1966, Roberts was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame.

In 1969, in conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s 100th anniversary, the Phillies conducted a fan vote to determine the Phillies all-time team. On August 5, 1969, at Connie Mack Stadium, the Phillies honored the members of the all-time team, including Roberts as the only right-handed pitcher. He was also honored as the greatest Phillies player of all time.

In 1978, the Philadelphia Phillies inducted Roberts as the first Phillie in the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame (along with Connie Mack as the first Athletics player in the Wall of Fame).

In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Phillies, Roberts was selected as one of only two right-handed pitchers on the Phillies Centennial Team.

In 1985, during Roberts&#x27; last game as coach of the South Florida Bulls baseball team, the team retired his number 36.

In 1992, Roberts was one of 30 members of the charter class of former Michigan State University Spartan athletes, coaches, and administrators inducted into the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame.

In 1998, the Wilmington Blue Rocks retired Roberts&#x27;s number 36 at the Carolina League All-Star game held at the Blue Rocks&#x27; Frawley Stadium. He was the first former player to ever have his number retired by the team.

In 1999, he ranked No. 74 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Roberts at number 72 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

On May 18, 2003, Roberts&#x27; number 36 was among the first two uniform numbers retired by the Michigan State baseball program.

On July 21, 2003, Roberts returned to Montpelier, Vermont, to accept two honors: The Vermont Mountaineers retired his number from his playing days with the Barre-Montpelier Twin City Trojans, and Governor Jim Douglas presented him a proclamation that made the day &quot;Robin Roberts Day&quot; in the State of Vermont.

On April 3, 2004, the Phillies new ballpark, Citizens Bank Park, officially opened, with a statue of Roberts outside the first-base gate.

Also in 2004, Roberts was a member of the inaugural class inducted into the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame.

In Roberts&#x27;s hometown of Springfield, Illinois, Robin Roberts Stadium is named in his honor.

Roberts was an outspoken critic of Little League baseball. His remarks on the organization appeared in a 1975 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article, titled &quot;Strike Out Little League&quot;.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Roberts as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army Air Force during World War II.

==Death==

Roberts died of natural causes on May 6, 2010, aged 83, at his home in Temple Terrace, Florida. For the remainder of their 2010 season, the Philadelphia Phillies wore a commemorative #36 patch on their uniforms and hung a Robin Roberts jersey in their dugout during home and away games.

<doc id="743876" wikidata="Q406704" url="?curid=743876" title="Air (free jazz trio)">
<text>Air was a free jazz trio founded by saxophone player Henry Threadgill, double bassist Fred Hopkins, and drummer Steve McCall in 1971.

==Career==
Threadgill was asked by Columbia College in Chicago to arrange a number of Scott Joplin songs. Joplin was so strongly associated with piano that the musicians enjoyed the challenge of performing his trademark songs without piano. They opted to play them as rags and as a basis for jazz improvization.

The album &quot;Air Lore&quot; contains improvizations over songs by Scott Joplin as well as selections by Jelly Roll Morton.

Air broke up and reformed several times, and after McCall&#x27;s death, Andrew Cyrille performed as part of the trio. They released two albums with drummer Pheeroan Aklaff as New Air on Black Saint Records.

<text>James Jackson Jeffries (April 15, 1875 – March 3, 1953) was an American professional boxer and world heavyweight champion.

He was known for his enormous strength and stamina. Using a technique taught to him by his trainer, former welterweight and middleweight Champion Tommy Ryan, Jeffries fought out of a crouch with his left arm extended forward. He was able to absorb tremendous punishment while wearing his opponents down.

Jeffries stood tall and weighed in his prime. He could run in just over ten seconds, and could high jump over . A natural left-hander, he possessed one-punch knockout power in his left hook, and brawled his way to the top of the rankings.

Writer Jack London coined the phrase &quot;Great White Hope&quot; to describe Jeffries in his attempt to win the heavyweight crown from African-American world champion Jack Johnson in 1910. Jeffries came out of retirement for the fight, urged on by London and many others who wished to see a white man once again reign as heavyweight champion. Jeffries was beaten by Johnson in what was the first prizefight to be billed as the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot;.

==Early life==
Jeffries moved with his family from their Ohio farm to Los Angeles, California, at age seven. He worked for a while as a boilermaker before going into boxing. In later life, &quot;The Boilermaker&quot; was one of his professional nicknames.

==Career==

As a powerfully built and athletic teenager, Jeffries boxed as an amateur until age 20, when he started fighting professionally.

In his third fight, Jeffries knocked out the highly regarded boxer Hank Griffin in the fourteenth round. Jack Johnson would subsequently fight Griffin on three separate occasions.

Jeffries fought the top heavyweight contender, Gus Ruhlin, to a draw. Ruhlin was knocked down with a brutal punch at the end of the final round and was saved by the bell from being counted out. The decision was met with unfavorable reactions from the audience, many of whom felt Jeffries won.

On his way to the title in 1898, Jeffries knocked out Peter Jackson, the great boxer whom John L. Sullivan had refused to fight, in three rounds. This had been only the second defeat in Jackson&#x27;s entire career; his first loss was from a four-round fight over thirteen years earlier around the beginning of his career. Jackson retired shortly afterward.

Jeffries defeated the formidable &quot;Mexican Pete&quot; Everett by knockout in only the third round on April 22, 1898. His next fight was against the Irishman Tom Sharkey. The fight went the full twenty rounds and Sharkey was knocked down in the eleventh round. Jeffries won the decision.

After defeating the big, fast-moving, sharp-jabbing Bob Armstrong, Jeffries had earned the right to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship.

===World Heavyweight Champion===
On June 9, 1899, in Brooklyn, New York, he defeated Bob Fitzsimmons by KO in the eleventh round to win the Heavyweight Championship of the World. That August, he embarked on a tour of Europe, putting on exhibition fights for the fans. Jeffries was involved in several motion pictures recreating portions of his championship fights. Filmed portions of his other bouts and of some of his exhibition matches survive to this day.

In his first title defense, he won a twenty-five-round decision in a rematch over Tom Sharkey.

Jeffries set the record for the quickest KO in a Heavyweight title fight ever, which was 45 seconds against Jack Finnegan in his second title defense.

His next defense was against the former Heavyweight Champion and legendary technician, James J. Corbett. Corbett had put up a perfect defense and could have arguably won had the fight gone the distance. However, Corbett was knocked out cold from a left to the jaw in the 23rd round of the scheduled 25-round fight.

Jeffries later got the chance to avenge his controversial draw with Gus Ruhlin when he defended his title against him on November 15, 1901. Claims that Ruhlin quit during the fifth round are incorrect. All of the local next-day San Francisco sources agree that Ruhlin&#x27;s manager, Billy Madden, threw in the towel to retire Ruhlin during the one-minute interval between the fifth and sixth rounds.

An example of Jeffries&#x27;s ability to absorb punishment and recover from a severe battering to win a bout came in his rematch for the title with Fitzsimmons, who is regarded as one of the hardest punchers in boxing history. The rematch with Jeffries occurred on July 25, 1902, in San Francisco. To train for the bout Jeffries&#x27;s daily training included a run, 2 hours of skipping rope, medicine ball training, 20 minutes sparring on the heavy bag, and at least 12 rounds of sparring in the ring. He also trained in wrestling. 

For nearly eight rounds Fitzsimmons subjected Jeffries to a vicious battering. Jeffries suffered a broken nose, both his cheeks were cut to the bone, and gashes were opened over both eyes. It appeared that the fight would have to be stopped, as blood freely flowed into Jeffries&#x27;s eyes. Then in the eighth round, Jeffries lashed out with a terrific right to the stomach, followed by a left hook to the jaw which knocked Fitzsimmons unconscious.

Jeffries and Corbett met one last time in the ring on August 14, 1903. This time Jeffries was in total control for all ten rounds of the scheduled 20-round bout. Tommy Ryan, Corbett&#x27;s chief second, threw a large palm-leaf fan into the ring to alert Referee Graney that he should stop the fight.
Jeffries had his seventh and final title defense against Canadian Jack Munroe, whom he stopped in only two rounds.

Jeffries broke the ribs of three opponents in title fights: Jim Corbett, Gus Ruhlin, and Tom Sharkey. Jeffries retired undefeated in May 1905. He served as a referee for the next few years, including the bout in which Marvin Hart defeated Jack Root to stake a claim at Jeffries&#x27;s vacated title. Jeffries had never been knocked down in his prime.

Jeffries had likely fought many more bouts than 22 at this time. Many of his fights were lost in history. Jeffries, however, had never been defeated before his original retirement.

===Comeback: &quot;The Fight of the Century&quot;===
Over five years after retiring, Jeffries made a comeback on July 4, 1910, at Reno, Nevada, in a match against champion Jack Johnson, who had won the Heavyweight Championship in 1908 by defeating Canadian champion Tommy Burns at Rushcutters Bay in Australia. Burns was the first heavyweight champion to fight black challengers.

The media put pressure onto Jeffries and promoters dangled wealth in front of him to take the fight. In addition to a guaranteed purse of $40,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars), to woo the ex-champ back into the ring, promoter Tex Rickard had signed him to a $75,000 personal contract.

After a six-year lay-off, the 35-year-old Jeffries was out of shape and had lost much of his muscle. Jeffries weighed over 330 pounds (150 kg), while Johnson was in fighting condition. The ex-champion had to lose about 110 pounds to get down to his fighting weight of 226. Previous Heavyweight Champion John L. Sullivan (an ethnic Irish American who refused to fight African-American contenders) remarked during an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Jeffries&#x27;s personal doctor was so amazed at Johnson&#x27;s physical condition that he felt Jeffries could win only if Johnson had a lack of skill on the day. As the media instigated racist remarks about winning the title for whites, Jeffries&#x27;s final words before the fight were, &quot;It is my intention to go right after my opponent and knock him out as soon as possible.&quot; His wife also commented, &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in prizefighting but I am interested in my husband&#x27;s welfare, I do hope this will be his last fight.&quot;

Ringside seats that had been priced at $50 were being scalped at $125 each (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). More than 1,000 spectators who were unable to get seats in the sold-out arena climbed over the walls to enter.

Before the fight, which was scheduled for 45 three-minute rounds, famous boxers who had traveled to Reno to witness the contest were introduced to the crowd, including Sam Langford, a black boxer who was unable to secure a title fight, even from Jack Johnson. The greatest applause went to Jake Kilrain, who had battled John L. Sullivan back in the bare-knuckle days.

At three minutes to 1 PM, Johnson entered the ring; his contract provided that he would always be first to enter the ring, to satisfy a superstition of his. The thermometer read 110 °F, which meant the match would be even more brutal due to heat. Jeffries soon joined Johnson in the ring. Rickard served as referee. Johnson and Jeffries could not agree on a referee, and Rickard&#x27;s publicity-minded offers to President William Howard Taft and writer Arthur Conan Doyle to serve as referee had been declined. Rickard took the position although he had never refereed a prize fight before.

In the first three rounds, the boxers sparred to feel each other out. Johnson, having read that no one could tie Jeffries up on the inside due to his power, told the press that not only would he do so, but that he planned to neutralize Jeffries&#x27;s power by twisting his arms behind him. Toward the end of the fourth round, he did just that, pinning Jeffries&#x27;s arms in back of him for a moment, but Jeffries broke the clinch. Johnson landed a solid overhand right to Jeffries&#x27;s head just before the bell.

Johnson began dominating the fight in rounds five through twelve, as his opponent faded in the heat and from Johnson&#x27;s onslaught. The heat began to get to Johnson, too, by round 13, but he was still the stronger and younger man in the ring. Toward the end of that round, he delivered a right and a right uppercut to Jeffries&#x27;s head that took their toll. In the next round, Jeffries eluded Johnson, who stalked him all over the ring.

In round 15, Johnson went after Jeffries and caught him against the ropes with a right upper-cut, followed by three left uppercuts that sent the ex-champ to the canvas for the first time in his career. He could no longer put up a defense and, as Jeffries got up, Johnson hit him with a left hook that sent him to the canvas and through the ropes, putting his torso outside the ring. Helped to his feet by one of his seconds and a fan, as soon as Jeffries was back in the ring he was rushed by Johnson, who knocked him down again with a right to the head. As Rickard moved in to separate the fighters, Jeffries got up, but his manager had entered the ring to stop the fight and save his fighter from being knocked out. Johnson retained the title by a technical knockout.

Johnson later remarked that he knew the fight was over in the fourth round when he landed an uppercut to Jeffries&#x27;s face and saw the look in his eyes. &quot;I knew what that look meant,&quot; he said. &quot;The old ship was sinking.&quot; John L. Sullivan commented for &quot;The New York Times&quot; after the fight that Johnson won deservedly, fairly, and convincingly:
==Later life==
In his later years, Jeffries trained boxers and worked as a fight promoter. He promoted many fights out of a structure known as &quot;Jeffries Barn&quot;, which was located on his alfalfa ranch at the southwest corner of Victory Boulevard and Buena Vista, Burbank, California. (His ranch house was on the southeast corner until the early 1960s.)

==Death==
Seven years after suffering a stroke, Jeffries died on March 3, 1953, in bed at his home, in the presence of his niece Lillian Bull. Bull had been living with Jeffries as his housekeeper, and he had instructed her to call a doctor. Jeffries died before the doctor arrived. The doctor, William M. Nethery, attributed his death to a heart attack caused by coronary thrombosis. His body was interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

==Legacy==

Today, the legacy of Jeffries is widely forgotten. However, he was once considered one of the greatest Heavyweight Champions of all time by many fellow boxers and boxing experts:

*Jack Root, Willie Ritchie and Tommy Burns, former Light Heavyweight, Lightweight and Heavyweight Champions, respectively, rated Jeffries as the greatest heavyweight.
*James J. Corbett said of Jeffries, &quot;The thing the always impressed me was the speed the youngster had, and he weighed two-hundred-twenty-five pounds. I hold that Jeffries was the greatest Heavyweight Champion of them all.&quot;
*Sam Langford, the great fighter who fought from lightweight to heavyweight, advertised to fight any man in the world, except Jim Jeffries.
*Tom Sharkey, heavyweight top contender, thought that Jeffries would have beaten Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis on the same night. He said Jeffries was strong like a bull and quick on his feet like a cat. Sharkey called Jeffries the greatest fighter of all time.
*Jack Johnson, the only man to beat Jeffries, stated in an interview with &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; that he thought Jeffries was the greatest. In another interview, Johnson said Jeffries would beat both Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis. 
*Jack Dempsey, the great Heavyweight Champion, once said: &quot;Jim Jeffries was a tough gun. If we could have gotten in the ring together, each at our best... I probably would have had my chin knocked off.&quot;
*William Brady, who managed both Jim Jeffries and Jim Corbett, remarked about Jeffries: &quot;There was never a man better fitted anatomically, physically, and temperamentally for the role of World&#x27;s Heavyweight Champion.&quot;
*Nat Fleischer, founder of &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; and The Ring Record book, described Jeffries: &quot;One of the most formidable fighting machines the prize ring ever produced.&quot;
*Dan Morgan, fight manager for forty years, who saw them all, rated Jeffries as the all-time best. Morgan called Jeffries a &quot;Champion of Champions&quot;.
*Tex Rickard, famed sportsman and promoter, held the view: &quot;Big Jim will always live in my memory as the greatest heavyweight boxer of his time. While he reigned supreme, he gave all a chance. He did not know the meaning of the word fear.&quot;
*W. W. Naughton, sportswriter of the day, records: &quot;To sum up his qualities of ringsmanship, it may be said he is fairly talented in every branch of self-defense. He boxes cleverly, defends himself well, and strikes a hard blow. But back of all these are the qualities which have made him a champion, magnificent strength and wonderful endurance.&quot;
*Dewitt Van Court, boxing instructor and athletic director of the Los Angeles Athletic Club wrote: &quot;I was with James J. Jeffries when he first started to box. I was with him when he won the Championship. I was with him when he lost it. Besides being the greatest Heavyweight Champion that ever lived, he is today and has been all his life, a man among men, a true friend with a heart as big as his body.&quot;

The city of Burbank embedded a small bronze plaque in the sidewalk at the site where James Jeffries died. The plaque was located on the southeast side of Buena Vista ~150 yards south of Victory Boulevard, before being stored at Burbank City Hall, and now is located at the Gordon R. Howard Museum.

Jeffries Avenue that runs parallel between Burbank and Victory boulevards in Burbank is named after him.

James J. Jeffries was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990.

<doc id="743894" wikidata="Q138974" url="?curid=743894" title="142 Polana">
<text>142 Polana is a very dark asteroid from the asteroid belt. It was discovered by Johann Palisa on January 28, 1875, and named after the city of Pola (now Pula, Croatia), home of the Austrian Naval Observatory where he made the discovery.

It is a major member of the eponymously named Polana family, which is a subgroup of the Nysa family. The asteroid has an estimated diameter of about 55.3 km and a low albedo of 0.045. It is orbiting at a distance of 2.419 times the separation of the Earth from the Sun, with an orbital period of 3.76 years and an eccentricity of 0.14.

In the Tholen classification scheme, Polana is a primitive carbonaceous asteroid of type F, which is a subdivision of more common C-type. Under the SMASS classification taxonomy, Polana is listed as a B-type asteroid, a group that combines both the Tholen B and F types. The spectrum of this object suggests the presence of magnetite (Fe3O4), which gives it the spectrally blue coloration that is a characteristic of this SMASS class.
== Mars resonance ==
Polana is in a 1:2 orbital resonance with Mars, meaning that Polana orbits the Sun once for every two orbits that Mars completes. This resonance helps protect the asteroid from orbital erosion: the orbital eccentricities of the resonant asteroids are clearly greater than the non-resonant asteroids. There is a peak in the number of asteroids located at 2.419 AU from the Sun. In spite of strong perturbations caused by the passing of both Jupiter and Mars, the 1:2 Mars resonance brings about stability for billions of years. There are up to 1,500 asteroids in this resonance, and the resonance between Polana and Mars will strengthen over the next million years due to Polana transitioning into a strong libration period with Mars.

<doc id="743900" wikidata="Q3301779" url="?curid=743900" title="Raine Maida">
<text>Raine Maida ( ; born Michael Anthony Maida; February 18, 1970) is a Canadian musician best known as being the lead vocalist and primary songwriter of the alternative rock band Our Lady Peace. He has come to be known for his unique countertenor nasal falsetto singing voice, as well as his cryptic and poetry-influenced song lyrics. He occasionally plays certain instruments, such as the acoustic guitar, while performing with Our Lady Peace. Following guitarist Mike Turner&#x27;s departure from Our Lady Peace in 2001, Maida is the only remaining original member of the band.

Maida began a solo career in 2006, releasing his first solo album &quot;The Hunters Lullaby&quot; in 2007. He also self-produced Our Lady Peace&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Burn Burn&quot;, in 2009. Maida has been married to Canadian singer Chantal Kreviazuk since 1999, and together they have three sons. Maida has been intimately involved with War Child and other charities since 2003, and was an outspoken critic of the Iraq War and former U.S. president George W. Bush.

== Early life ==
Michael Anthony Maida was born in Weston, Ontario, in 1970. His parents split up when he was very young. Before pursuing a musical career, Maida studied criminology at the University of Toronto, and prior to that attended Ridley College in St. Catharines although he did not graduate. Around late 1991, Maida changed his given name from &quot;Michael&quot; to &quot;Raine&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Our Lady Peace ===

Raine Maida is the vocalist and a founding member of the Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace. Maida started the band with guitarist Mike Turner in 1992. Especially on the albums prior to &quot;Gravity&quot;, he often sang in a high, nasal voice. This singing style, along with Maida&#x27;s cryptic lyrics, became one of the features of Our Lady Peace&#x27;s music. After working with producer Bob Rock on the album &quot;Gravity&quot;, his voice became less nasal, and his tone became slightly deeper. His lyrics were also less Delphic, although these attributes have been abandoned and his older singing style and lyrical work has returned to a certain degree on the band&#x27;s 2012 album, &quot;Curve&quot;. Maida has released seven albums with Our Lady Peace, plus a live album and two greatest hits collections, namely &quot;A Decade&quot; and &quot;The Very Best of Our Lady Peace&quot;.

=== Solo work ===
Maida released a four song EP called &quot;Love Hope Hero&quot; on November 14, 2006. The EP contains the songs &quot;One Second Chance&quot;, &quot;Earthless&quot;, &quot;Sex Love and Honey&quot;, and &quot;Careful What You Wish For&quot;. The EP was sold on tours with Chantal Kreviazuk, on his website, and on iTunes.

His full-length solo album, &quot;The Hunters Lullaby&quot;, was released on November 13, 2007, by independent label Kingnoise Records. The album was recorded in Maida&#x27;s own studio using mostly acoustic instruments, and is described by Maida as &quot;a collection of poems put to music&quot;. Kreviazuk is featured on several tracks, singing and playing piano.

Before releasing his second solo album, it was stated that songs from the album would be released starting August 24, 2010, with the song &quot;Bury Me with a Gun&quot;, and from then on a new song would be released every few weeks until the release of the completed album in early 2011. Maida&#x27;s website was then updated with the possible album title of &quot;Pachamama&quot; with a release date of February 20, 2012. However, a few days after this date had passed, the date was replaced with &quot;Coming Soon&quot;.

On June 22, 2012, Maida announced the release of the free EP &quot;Pachamama&quot; available for download on Maida&#x27;s official website, featuring three new tracks and cover artwork.

On February 8, 2013, CBC Music&lt;ref name=&quot;http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2013/2/Raine-Maida-releases-video-for-new-single-Montreal&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; debuted the official lyric video for the album&#x27;s official first single &quot;Montreal&quot;. On May 14, 2013, &quot;We All Get Lighter&quot; was released. The album did not include the originally intended single &quot;Bury Me with a Gun&quot;.

=== Producing and writing ===
Maida has also been producing music since 1999, when he co-produced Our Lady Peace&#x27;s albums &quot;Happiness...Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch&quot; and &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;. He has developed numerous indie bands, including Texas-based Sleepway, Lightbreak and Billy the Kid.

He produced four songs on the dance punk band Men, Women &amp; Children&#x27;s self-titled debut for Warner Bros. Records. He co-wrote and produced five tracks on Avril Lavigne&#x27;s second album &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, released in 2004.

Maida and Chantal Kreviazuk contributed to Kelly Clarkson&#x27;s song &quot;Where Is Your Heart?&quot;; Kreviazuk co-wrote it, while Maida produced and played the guitar. Maida and Kreviazuk also helped write the international hit &quot;Walk Away&quot;, another song on Clarkson&#x27;s album, &quot;Breakaway&quot;. They also co-wrote &quot;One Minute&quot; for Clarkson&#x27;s third album, &quot;My December&quot;.
Maida and Kreviazuk contributed to The Veronicas&#x27; first album &quot;The Secret Life Of...&quot;; they wrote and produced the song &quot;Revolution&quot;. Maida and Kreviazuk also co-wrote &quot;Outside of You&quot; with Pink but the song ended up on Hilary Duff&#x27;s 2007 release, &quot;Dignity&quot;. The two wrote and produced both the first single and theme for Cheyenne Kimball&#x27;s MTV reality show and album &quot;The Day Has Come&quot;. They wrote &quot;Meant to Fly&quot; for Eva Avila, the winner of the fourth season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, and wrote the first single of Rex Goudie&#x27;s second album &quot;Look Closer&quot;, called &quot;You Got to Me&quot;.

Most recently, they co-wrote the song &quot;Permanent&quot; with American Idol winner David Cook. Maida also collaborated with Cook on the songs &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Mr. Sensitive&quot;, and &quot;I Did It for You&quot;, on the self-titled album, &quot;David Cook&quot;. Maida has also been co-writing with the pop punk band Hawk Nelson for the 2008 released album Hawk Nelson Is My Friend. Maida has co-writes on numerous releases including Alternative rock bands Uncle Kracker, Green River Ordinance, Marianas Trench and Toronto-based Die Mannequin. Maida also co-wrote a song, &quot;Unapologize&quot; for Carrie Underwood&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Play On&quot;.

=== LOOP/POOL ===
Maida is a cofounder and director at LOOP/POOL, a Canadian artist-focused and social-forward cannabis brand. LOOP/POOL has committed a minimum of five percent of proceeds towards POOL/FUND, a philanthropic organization to support independent Canadian artists who have been underserved or unable to access funding from existing grant programs, and further struggling during the pandemic.

“I am thrilled to be part of LOOP/POOL’s journey to bring licensed cannabis products to market in support of emerging Canadian talent,” said Minhas. “Cannabis is an exciting industry that can be shaped by new innovative and creative partnerships. The natural fit between Inner Spirit’s Spiritleaf retail brand and LOOP/POOL will allow us to build on the opportunities to expand the industry and benefit artists.”

=== S!NG ===
Maida signed on with the S!NG team as their Chief Product Officer, a developer of tools that allow creators to control distribution and monetize their work. It launched in March 2021 with the world’s first free mobile application designed to instantly mint NFTs to sell or license online. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, allow artists to create verifiably-unique originals of their work, while protecting intellectual property. “S!NG is the safest and easiest platform for creators to mint NFTs,” says Maida. “There is no better time to be an artist than right now, because we are on the precipice of an artistic revolution where control belongs to the artist. This is an industry game changer.” 

Maida said in an interview the app will help artists protect their work and connect with fans in a more efficient way. “The ability to sell directly to your fans and monetize that in ways that we never really thought of before, it’s a tectonic shift that’s happening,” he said, explaining that artists who make their work available as an NFT are in charge of the ownership of that content. “When you see artists who don’t have a huge following selling completed works [and] when there isn’t that middle-man, fans will engage and participate,” Maida said. “It goes back to the day of when we were starting out playing in clubs and you’d put out a signup sheet at the merch table to get emails from fans, why did we want that? Because I wanted to talk to them directly. And socials, Twitter, Instagram, I think it helped for a minute, but it does dilute that relationship.”

=== Other work ===

Maida had a small role in a Canadian movie released in 2001, &quot;Century Hotel&quot;. He played the character Damon Riley. In 2005, Maida contributed &quot;Liar&quot; to &quot;Act 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies&quot; from Neverending White Lights. Maida received special thanks on People in Planes album &quot;Beyond The Horizon&quot;. Maida and Kreviazuk wrote an original song for the HBO documentary &quot;Ithuteng&quot;, and composed music for the restored version of Helen Gardner&#x27;s 1912 silent film version of Cleopatra.

Both Maida and Kreviazuk are strong advocates of the organization War Child having traveled and filmed documentaries in Iraq, Darfur, and Ethiopia. Maida produced a War Child Canada benefit album entitled &quot;Help!: A Day in the Life&quot;. His efforts have led to a number of distinctions, including the Tiffany Mark Award, WarChild&#x27;s &quot;Philanthropist of the Year&quot;, the Allan Slaight Humanitarian Award and the prestigious Alan Waters Humanitarian Award from the Juno Awards. Maida and Kreviazuk both also co-hosted a 2006 Mothers Against Drunk Driving video. Maida is also known for his advocacy work with The David Suzuki Foundation, The Hospital for Sick Children and Apathy Is Boring. He recently founded Harmony House, a music therapy retreat for war veterans. Raine has also expressed support for the Green Party of Canada.

In December 2014 Maida was appointed a member of the Order of Canada along with Kreviazuk by Governor General David Johnston for their charitable and humanitarian work.

== Personal life ==
Maida met Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk at a Pearl Jam concert in Toronto in 1996. They married in December 1999 in Toronto, and have three sons together. In honour of their tenth wedding anniversary, Maida and Kreviazuk renewed their wedding vows in Costa Rica in November 2009. From 2016 to 2017, the couple went on tour for their new side project titled &quot;Moon Vs. Sun&quot;.

Kreviazuk and Maida appeared in the 2019 documentary film &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Break Your Heart&quot;, which detailed both their collaboration on the album &quot;Moon vs. Sun&quot; and the conflicts and tensions that had arisen in their marriage after 19 years.

<text>Mount Zion (, &quot;Har Ṣīyyōn&quot;; , &quot;Jabal Sahyoun&quot;) is a hill in Jerusalem, located just outside the walls of the Old City to the south. The term Mount Zion has been used in the Hebrew Bible first for the City of David (, ; , ) and later for the Temple Mount, but its meaning has shifted and it is now used as the name of ancient Jerusalem&#x27;s Western Hill. In a wider sense, the term Zion is also used for the entire Land of Israel.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word &quot;Zion&quot; is uncertain. Mentioned in the Bible in the Book of Samuel (2 Samuel 5:7) as the name of the Jebusite fortress conquered by King David, its origin likely predates the Israelites. If Semitic, it may be associated with the Hebrew root &quot;ṣiyyôn&quot; (&quot;castle&quot;). Though not spoken in Jerusalem until 1,700 years later, the name is similar in Arabic and may be connected to the root &quot;ṣiyya&quot; (&quot;dry land&quot;) or the Arabic &quot;šanā&quot; (&quot;protect&quot; or &quot;citadel&quot;). It might also be related to the Arabic root &quot;ṣahî&quot; (&quot;ascend to the top&quot;) or &quot;ṣuhhay&quot; (&quot;tower&quot; or &quot;the top of the mountain&quot;). A non-Semitic relationship to the Hurrian word &quot;šeya&quot; (&quot;river&quot; or &quot;brook&quot;) has also been suggested. 

&quot;Sahyun&quot; (, &quot;Ṣahyūn&quot; or &quot;Ṣihyūn&quot;) is the word for Zion in Arabic and Syriac. A valley called &quot;Wâdi Sahyûn&quot; (&quot;wadi&quot; being the Arabic for &quot;valley&quot;) seemingly preserves the name and is located approximately one and three-quarter miles () from the Old City of Jerusalem&#x27;s Jaffa Gate.

The phrase &quot;Har Tzion&quot;, lit. &quot;Mount Zion&quot;, appears nine times in the Tanakh.

==The three different locations==
The name &quot;Mount Zion&quot; referred successively to three locations, as Jerusalemites preserved the time-honoured name, but shifted the location they venerated as the focal point of biblical Jerusalem to the site considered most appropriate in their own time.

===Lower Eastern Hill (City of David)===
At first, Mount Zion was the name given to the Jebusite fortified city on the lower part of ancient Jerusalem&#x27;s Eastern Hill, also known as the City of David.

According to the Book of Samuel, Mount Zion was the site of the Jebusite fortress called the &quot;stronghold of Zion&quot; that was conquered by King David, then renamed and partially rebuilt by him as the &quot;City of David&quot;, where he erected his palace.

===Upper Eastern Hill (Temple Mount)===
Once the First Temple was erected at the top of the Eastern Hill, the name &quot;Mount Zion&quot; migrated there too.

After the conquest of the Jebusite city, its built-up area expanded northward towards the uppermost part of the same, Eastern Hill. This highest part became the site of Solomon&#x27;s Temple.

The identification of the pre-Israelite (Jebusite) and Israelite towns on the Eastern Hill is based on the existence of only one perennial water source in the area, the Gihon Spring, and on archaeological excavations revealing sections of the Bronze Age and Iron Age city walls and water systems.

The &quot;Mount Zion&quot; mentioned in the later parts of the Book of Isaiah (), in the Book of Psalms, and the First Book of Maccabees (c. 2nd century BCE; ) seems to refer to the top of the hill, generally known as the Temple Mount.

===Western Hill (today&#x27;s Mount Zion)===
The last shift of the name Mount Zion was to the Western Hill, which is more dominant than the Eastern Hill and seemed to first-century CE Jerusalemites the worthier location for the by-then lost palace of King David. The Western Hill is what today is called Mount Zion.

In the second half of the First Temple period, the city expanded westward and its defensive walls were extended to include the entire Western Hill behind them. Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed the city almost completely around 586 BCE, severing the continuity of historical memory. A long period of rebuilding followed, ending with Jerusalem&#x27;s second total destruction at the hands of the Romans in 70 CE. Josephus, the first-century CE historian who knew the city as it was before this second catastrophic event, identified Mount Zion as being the Western Hill, separated from the lower, Eastern Hill, by what he calls the &quot;Tyropoeon Valley&quot;. It must however be said that Josephus never used the name &quot;Mount Zion&quot; in any of his writings, but described the &quot;Citadel&quot; of King David as being situated on the higher and longer hill, thus pointing at the Western Hill as what the Bible calls Mount Zion.

==History since the Late Roman period==
At the end of the Roman period, a synagogue was built at the entrance of the structure known as David&#x27;s Tomb, probably based on the belief that David brought the Ark of the Covenant here from Beit Shemesh and Kiryat Ye&#x27;arim before the construction of the Temple.

During the 1948 war, Mount Zion was conquered by the Harel Brigade on May 18, 1948, and became the only part of the Old City to stay in Israeli hands until the armistice. At first it was linked to the Jewish neighborhood of Yemin Moshe across the Valley of Hinnom via a narrow tunnel, but eventually an alternative was needed to evacuate the wounded and transport supplies to soldiers on Mount Zion. A cable car capable of carrying a load of 250 kilograms was designed for this purpose. The cable car was only used at night and lowered into the valley during the day to escape detection; it is still in place at what is now the Mount Zion Hotel. The ride from the Israeli position at the St. John Eye Hospital to Mount Zion took two minutes.

Between 1948 and 1967, when the Old City was under Jordanian rule, Israelis were forbidden access to the Jewish holy places. Mount Zion was a designated no-man&#x27;s land between Israel and Jordan. Mount Zion was the closest accessible site to the ancient Jewish Temple. Until East Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, Israelis would climb to the rooftop of David&#x27;s Tomb to pray. The winding road leading up to Mount Zion is known as Pope&#x27;s Way (&quot;Derekh Ha&#x27;apifyor&quot;). In his Epistle to the Romans, Paul noted: “Happy is he whose conscience does not condemn him in that which he allows” (Romans 14:22) It was paved in honor of the historic visit to Jerusalem of Pope Paul VI in 1964.

==Biblical references ==
The Tanakh reference to &quot;Har Tzion&quot; (Mount Tzion) that identifies its location is derived from the Psalm 48 composed by the sons of Korah, i.e. Levites, as &quot;the northern side of the city of the great king&quot;, which Radak interprets as the City of David &quot;from the City of David, which is Zion (1 Kings 8:1–2; 2 Chron. 5:2)&quot;. 2 Samuel 5:7 also reads, &quot;David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David,&quot; which identifies Mount Tzion as part of the City of David, and not an area outside today&#x27;s Old City of Jerusalem. Rashi identifies the location as the source of &quot;joy&quot; mentioned in the Psalm as the Temple Courtyard, the location of atonement offerings in the northern part of the Temple complex.

In the New Testament, Mount Zion is used metaphorically to refer to the heavenly Jerusalem, God&#x27;s holy, eternal city. Christians are said to have &quot;come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven&quot; (Hebrews 12:22–23, cf. Revelation 14:1).

==Landmarks==
Important sites on Mount Zion are Dormition Abbey, the Armenian Monastery of St. Saviour, King David&#x27;s Tomb and the Room of the Last Supper. Most historians and archeologists today do not regard &quot;David&#x27;s Tomb&quot; there to be the actual burial place of King David. The Chamber of the Holocaust (&quot;Martef HaShoah&quot;), the precursor of Yad Vashem, is also located on Mount Zion. Another place of interest is the Catholic cemetery where Oskar Schindler, a Righteous Gentile who saved the lives of 1,200 Jews in the Holocaust, is buried.

Notable burials in the Protestant cemetery on Mt. Zion include a number of prominent individuals from the 19th and 20th centuries. These include explorers and archaeologists such as: Flinders Petrie, Charles Frederick Tyrwhitt Drake, James Duncan, Clarence Stanley Fisher, Charles Lambert and James Leslie Starkey; the architect Conrad Schick; and pioneers in the fields of medicine, education, religion, diplomacy and social services such as James Edward Hanauer, Ernest Masterman, John Nicholayson, Paul Palmer, Max Sandreczky, Johann Ludwig Schneller, Horatio G. Spafford, author of the hymn &quot;It Is Well With My Soul&quot;. Also buried in the cemetery are G. Douglas Young, founder of Jerusalem University College, and his wife Georgina (Snook) Young. The cemetery is also the final resting place for a number of soldiers who fought in the First World War, as well as members of the Palestinian Police who served under the British mandate. Several persons buried here were killed in the bombing of the King David Hotel on the morning of 22 July 1946.

In 1874, an Englishman, Henry Maudsley, discovered a large segment of rock scarp and numerous ancient dressed stones on Mount Zion that were believed to be the base of Josephus&#x27;s First Wall. Several of these stones were used to construct a retaining wall outside the main gate of the Bishop Gobat school (later known as the American Institute of Holy Land Studies and Jerusalem University College).

<text>Mount Sion () is a Gaelic Athletic Association club located in Waterford City, County Waterford, Ireland. It was founded by teachers in the school of the same name. Although technically separate from the school, the club still maintains a close relationship with the school, sharing the same sports facilities in the city.

The club fields teams in both the Waterford Hurling and Gaelic football championships and has had many famous players, including John Keane, Philly Grimes, Tony Browne and Ken McGrath.

The club is mainly concerned with the game of hurling and is the most successful in Waterford with 35 county title wins, although they did win 5 county football titles back in the 1950s. They have also won 2 Munster Senior Hurling titles, in 1981 with victory over Limerick club South Liberties (3-9 to 1–4) and in 2002 beating Sixmilebridge of Clare (0-12 to 0–10). The club has produced a number of All Star winning players for Waterford and also two Inter-county hurlers of the year, Tony Browne in 1998 and Austin Gleeson in 2016. John Keane was also selected on the hurling team of the millennium. Frankie Walsh was the last Waterford man to lift the Liam McCarthy cup in 1959.

Mount Sion won titles in 1994, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2006 with players such a such Ken McGrath, Tony Browne, Brian Greene, Eoin Daniels, Eoin Kelly, and Eoin McGrath. Since 2006, Mount Sion have had something of a barren period going without a county final win and, while they reached the final in 2014, Ballygunner came out on top on a score line of 2–16 to 0–9.

<doc id="743909" wikidata="Q185981" url="?curid=743909" title="Rotation period (astronomy)">
<text>In astronomy, the rotation period or spin period of a celestial object (e.g., star, planet, moon, asteroid) has two definitions. The first one corresponds to the &quot;sidereal rotation period&quot; (or &quot;sidereal day&quot;), i.e., the time that the object takes to complete a full rotation around its axis relative to the background stars (inertial space). The other type of commonly used &quot;rotation period&quot; is the object&#x27;s &quot;synodic rotation period&quot; (or &quot;solar day&quot;), which may differ, by a fraction of a rotation or more than one rotation, to accommodate the portion of the object&#x27;s orbital period around a star or another body during one day.

==Measuring rotation==
For solid objects, such as rocky planets and asteroids, the rotation period is a single value. For gaseous or fluid bodies, such as stars and giant planets, the period of rotation varies from the object&#x27;s equator to its pole due to a phenomenon called differential rotation. Typically, the stated rotation period for a giant planet (such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) is its internal rotation period, as determined from the rotation of the planet&#x27;s magnetic field. For objects that are not spherically symmetrical, the rotation period is, in general, not fixed, even in the absence of gravitational or tidal forces. This is because, although the rotation axis is fixed in space (by the conservation of angular momentum), it is not necessarily fixed in the body of the object itself. As a result of this, the moment of inertia of the object around the rotation axis can vary, and hence the rate of rotation can vary (because the product of the moment of inertia and the rate of rotation is equal to the angular momentum, which is fixed). For example, Hyperion, a moon of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.

<text>Louis Alexandre Chiron (; 3 August 1899 – 22 June 1979) was a Monégasque racing driver who competed in rallies, sports car races, and Grands Prix.

Among the greatest drivers between the two World Wars, his career embraced over thirty years, starting in 1923, and ending at the end of the 1950s. He is still the oldest driver ever to have started a race in the Formula One World Championship, having taken 6th place in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix when he was 55. Three years later he became the oldest driver to enter a Formula One race, at 58. The Bugatti Chiron takes its name from him. Until 2024, when Charles Leclerc matched his achievement, he was the only Monegasque driver to have won the Monaco Grand Prix.

== Early life and career ==

Coming from a family of wine-growers, Louis Chiron&#x27;s father gained employment as a butler in the Hôtel de Paris at Monaco. As a teenager, Louis was employed as a bellboy at the hotel, and his interest in cars and racing started at that time. During World War I, he was seconded from an artillery regiment as a driver for Maréchal Pétain and Maréchal Foch, thanks to his persistence and a driving license financed by a Russian duchess he met at the hotel.

Employed as a dancer after World War I, Chiron&#x27;s racing career started in 1923, after a rich American woman he was friends with bought him a second hand Bugatti Brescia. He started in local hillclimbs, and moved to Grand Prix racing in 1926, after getting a Bugatti T35, and befriending rich industrialist Alfred Hoffman. He won the Grand Prix du Comminges that year, at Saint-Gaudens, near Toulouse.

== Driving career ==

Starting in 1928, Chiron became a Bugatti factory driver in parallel to his role in Hoffman&#x27;s private team. During that period, he became one of the dominant drivers in Grand Prix racing. He took major victories at the 1928 Italian Grand Prix, 1929 German Grand Prix, and 1930 Belgian Grand Prix. In the Indianapolis 500 of 1929, he drove a Delage to 7th place. He won the 1931 Monaco Grand Prix and 1931 French Grand Prix in a Bugatti T51.

Chiron&#x27;s partnership with Hoffman ended in the early 1930s after he was found having an affair with his wife Alice. He was also fired from Bugatti&#x27;s factory team at the end of 1932. He then founded with his friend Rudolf Caracciola a new team, called Scuderia CC. At the team&#x27;s first race, the 1933 Monaco Grand Prix, Caracciola had a season ending accident, and Chiron switched to Alfa Romeo cars run by Scuderia Ferrari mid-season. He won the 1933 Spa 24 hours race with specialist endurance racer Luigi Chinetti in an Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 Monza.

Chiron drove an Alfa Romeo P3 run by Ferrari for the 1934 Grand Prix season. He won the 1934 French Grand Prix at Montlhéry, against several works Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union entries, a race that is often considered one of the greatest victories of his career. The Alfa Romeos struggled against the German cars in 1935, and Chiron only salvaged a podium at the 1935 Belgian Grand Prix and a minor victory at the Lorraine Grand Prix that year.

Chiron moved to Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s factory team for the 1936 Grand Prix season. He started the European championship campaign with a pole at his home race of Monaco, but his race ended after an accident on lap one. A more serious accident at the second round, the 1936 German Grand Prix, left him with head and shoulders injuries. He decided to retire from Grand Prix racing after that. He won the 1937 French Grand Prix, a race that was run for sports cars only that year.

Chiron retired from racing in 1938, and World War II curtailed motor racing a year later. When racing resumed after the War, he came out of retirement and drove a Talbot-Lago to victory in two French Grands Prix.

According to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review of fellow driver Hellé Nice&#x27;s biography, Chiron accused her, at a 1949 party in Monaco to celebrate the first postwar Monte Carlo Rally, of &quot;collaborating with the Nazis&quot;. The review says biographer Miranda Seymour is &quot;circumspect on Nice&#x27;s guilt&quot;. A review of the same book in &quot;The New York Times&quot; says Nice was accused of being a &quot;Gestapo agent&quot;; that Seymour &quot;rebuts&quot; the charge; and that it made Nice &quot;unemployable&quot;. Seymour&#x27;s book says that in a letter to Antony Noghes, the head of the Monte Carlo Rally committee, Hellé Nice &quot;protested her innocence&quot;; that she told him she would appeal to the Monaco court unless Chiron wrote an apology; that no letter from Chiron has been found; and that the court has no record of such a case between 1949 and 1955.

Chiron took part in the first ever Formula One World Championship season in 1950, as a factory Maserati driver. At his home Grand Prix of Monaco he finished in third, at age 50, the only points scoring finish of his career.

Paired with the Swiss driver Ciro Basadonna, Chiron won the 1954 Monte Carlo Rally. His last race was in 1955, when he took a Lancia D50 to sixth place in the Monaco Grand Prix a few weeks before his 56th birthday, becoming the oldest driver to compete in a Formula One race. He is also the oldest driver ever to have entered for a Formula One race, taking part in practice for the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix when he was 58.

== Later life and legacy ==

Chiron retired after 35 years in racing but maintained an executive role with the organizers of the Monaco Grand Prix, who honoured him with a statue on the Grand Prix course and renamed the Swimming Pool corner after him. As he had achieved the greatest number of podium finishes in Bugattis, the 1999 Bugatti 18/3 Chiron concept car and the 2016 Bugatti Chiron are named in his honour.

Louis Chiron was so popular in Czechoslovakia, whose Grand Prix he won three consecutive times, that even after 75 years his name still lives in a popular saying &quot;He drives like Chiron&quot;, used mainly when referring to speeding motorists or generally to people who drive very quickly.

Chiron was the only Monegasque driver to score points in a Formula One race until Charles Leclerc in the 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and the only Monegasque to score a podium until Leclerc in the 2019 Bahrain Grand Prix.

<text>Johann Christian Ludwig (Louis) Abeille (20 February 1761 in Bayreuth – 2 March 1838 in Stuttgart) was a German pianist, organist, conductor, music teacher and composer.

==Life==

His father was baronial valet and his mother was Christine Louise Abeille, both of whom were employed at the Bayreuth court. Starting at age eleven, he was educated at the Karlsschule in Stuttgart, where his teachers were Antonio Boroni, Ferdinando Mazzanti, and Johann Gottlieb Sämann. In 1782, he became a member of the musicians of the Court at the Duke of Württemberg in Stuttgart. He joined the faculty of Karl&#x27;s High School (Hohe Karlsschule), a rigorous military academy, in 1786. In 1802, he became concertmaster and later organist of the Court, replacing Johann Rudolf Zumsteeg. In this position, Abeille served as Maestro di Capella to the Duke for several years. In 1815, he became court organist at the court church and director of the Stiftsmusik. He retired in 1832.

Ludwig Abeille was married to Henriette Hedwig née Haug, the daughter of the instrument maker Johann Friedrich Haug and his first wife Christine Dorothea Herdle (1736–1766). Christine was a daughter of the Ludwigsburg court musician Johann Jakob Ferdinand Herdle. Ludwig had seven children altogether, including four girls and three boys.

He wrote several folk songs, concerts, and two operas, &quot;Amor und Psyche&quot; and &quot;Peter und Ännchen&quot;, in the same style as Mozart. Abeille also wrote three sonatas for keyboard with accompanying violin (1783) as well as several instrumental works. During his time, he was known for his work &quot;Sonata and 9 Variations&quot;, which was modeled after Mozart&#x27;s music. He was also known for his Concerto for Piano 4 hands and Orchestra. His works were known for their melodies and gracefulness and were respected by Carl Maria von Weber.

==Works==

Abeille wrote piano, chamber and vocal music and also the musical plays &#x27;Cupid and Psyche&#x27;, and &#x27;Peter and Aennchen&#x27;.

<text>Foje was one of the most successful and best known rock bands in Lithuania.

== History == 
Foje was formed in the present-day Antakalnis Secondary School in Vilnius by Andrius Mamontovas, Arnoldas Lukošius and Darius Tarasevičius in 1983 under the name of Sunki Muzika (&quot;Hard Music&quot;), few months later Algis Kriščiūnas joined the band. In 1984 it was renamed to Foje (literal meaning: &quot;foyer&quot;). Through its years, the band survived a number of lineup changes, and released over 10 albums. 

The group cited several influences, including the sound of the Stranglers, as well as the 1980s post-punk movement (for example the notable nod to Depeche Mode on Foje&#x27;s 1989 electronica album &quot;Žodžiai į Tylą&quot;). These influences were combined with the often gloomy, desperate lyrics of the band&#x27;s leader Andrius Mamontovas.

In 1997 the band performed three farewell gigs in the Lithuanian cities of Klaipėda, Kaunas and Vilnius, with attendance of 60,000 in the final performance on 17 May in Vingis Park of Vilnius. After disbanding Mamontovas started a solo career.

Two of the band&#x27;s songs - &quot;Laužo šviesa&quot; (&quot;The Light of the Bonfire&quot;) (1986) and &quot;Meilės nebus per daug&quot; (&quot;There will not be too much love&quot;) (1994) - were voted by the media professionals into the Top 20 best Lithuanian songs of the 20th century in 2000.

<doc id="743919" wikidata="Q3954881" url="?curid=743919" title="Richard Martin (Irish politician)">
<text>Colonel Richard Martin (15 January 1754 – 6 January 1834), was an Irish politician and campaigner against cruelty to animals. He was known as Humanity Dick, a nickname bestowed on him by King George IV. He succeeded in getting the pioneering Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822, nicknamed &#x27;Martin&#x27;s Act&#x27;, passed into British law.

==Early life==
Martin was born at Dangan in County Galway, the only son of Robert Martin FitzAnthony of Birch Hall, County Galway, and Bridget Barnwall, a daughter of Robert Barnewall, 12th Baron Trimlestown. He was raised at Dangan House, situated on the Corrib River, four miles upriver from the town of Galway. His father&#x27;s family were Jacobites and one of &quot;The Tribes of Galway,&quot; fourteen merchant families who ruled Galway from the 14th to 17th centuries. The Barnwalls were an ennobled family of Norman descent based in the counties of Dublin, Kildare and Meath in Leinster. Bridget Barnwall died when Richard was nine years old. Richard&#x27;s father later married Mary Lynch, a member of another &quot;Tribal&quot; family, with whom he had sons Robert and Anthony. Though both of his parents were born to Catholics, Richard Martin was raised a Protestant and educated in England and later became a wealthy landlord in Ireland.

He studied at Harrow and then after some tutelage for exams to gain admission at Trinity College, Cambridge, he &quot;was admitted a gentleman-commoner at Trinity on 4 March 1773.&quot; Martin did not graduate with a degree but studied for admission to the bar and was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 1 February 1776. He served as a lawyer in Ireland and became High Sheriff of Galway in 1782.

In the &quot;Londonderry Journal&quot; of 13 June 1786, it was reported that Martin&#x27;s black slave boy, reputedly the son of a west African king, was permitted to resign from Martin&#x27;s service after his father had died and he was recalled to succeed to the throne.

==Adult life==
Martin entered the Irish House of Commons in 1776, sitting for Jamestown until 1783. After a break of fifteen years, he was returned to Parliament for Lanesborough in 1798, promoting Catholic Emancipation. Just before the Act of Union dissolved the Irish Parliament and obliged Irish MPs to sit in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, he was elected for County Galway. He continued to represent County Galway in Westminster as a political independent until 1812 and again from 1818, supporting the Tory government of Lord Liverpool. In the House of Commons he was known for his interruptions and humorous speeches. He continued his work towards Irish Catholic Emancipation till 1826, when he had to flee to France. Emancipation was finally granted in 1829, much to his delight. He was also &quot;a member of the Society for the amelioration and gradual abolition of Slavery throughout the British Dominions which had been formed in 1823.&quot;

==Anti-animal cruelty and RSPCA==


Martin is now best known for his work against animal cruelty, especially against bear baiting and dog fighting. Martin&#x27;s attempt to have an anti-cruelty-to-animals bill passed stands in a chronological line with some previous failed efforts in England&#x27;s Parliament. A sympathetic groundswell of public opinion emerged in the late 18th and early 19th century in opposition to cultural amusements such as bull-baiting and cock-fighting and in the visible maltreatment of animals that were herded in for slaughter at London&#x27;s Smithfield Market. The first unsuccessful legislative attempt was led by William Johnstone Pulteney on 18 April 1800 to ban bull-baiting but it was lost to the opposition vote in the House of Commons. A renewed effort was undertaken in 1809 with an anti-cruelty bill introduced into the House of Lords by Lord Erskine (1750–1823) which passed in that House but was defeated by a vote in the House of Commons. Martin voted in favour of both Pulteney&#x27;s and Erskine&#x27;s bills.

Martin drafted a new bill in consultation with the then retired Lord Erskine as well as with the agricultural writer and animal rights advocate John Lawrence (1753-1839)., entitled the &quot;Ill Treatment of Cattle Bill&quot;. The bill passed in the House of Commons by twenty-nine to eighteen votes, then through the House of Lords and was signed by the king, becoming the Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822 on 21 June 1822. He also tried to spread his ideas in the streets of London, becoming the target of jokes and political cartoons that depicted him with the ears of a donkey. He also sometimes paid fines of minor offenders. In May 1824 he attempted to widen the scope of anti-cruelty legislation by introducing the Slaughtering of Horses Bill which would have obliged licensed slaughterhouses to keep proper records of food allocated to each horse and with penalties applied to those using a horse that had a disabled limb to haul carts. This bill was defeated on 15 June 1824.

In 1821 letters were exchanged by various correspondents in periodicals raising concerns about the maltreatment of animals, which included one written by Rev. Arthur Broome that was published in &quot;The Kaleidoscope&quot; on 6 March 1821. Broome attempted to bring together the patronage of persons who were of social rank and committed to social reforms and he chaired a meeting that was held in November 1822 to create a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. This initial attempt however faltered and a fresh attempt to launch the society was organized by Broome at a meeting on 16 June 1824 at Old Slaughter&#x27;s Coffee House, London. Broome invited various clergy, lawyers and parliamentarians to vote on the resolution to create the Society and among those present were Thomas Fowell Buxton MP (1786-1845), William Wilberforce (1759-1833), Richard Martin, Sir James Mackintosh MP, Basil Montagu, William Mudford, Rev. George Avery Hatch (1757-1837), Rev George Bonner (1784-1840), Sir James Graham, J. G. Meymott, John Ashley Warre and Lewis Gompertz. Broome was elected as the society&#x27;s first honorary secretary.

Due to Martin&#x27;s profile as a politician and as the drafter of the anti-cruelty legislation, a public perception developed that he was the initiator and creator of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. At the Society&#x27;s first anniversary meeting Martin set the public record straight and gave credit to Rev Broome by stating: &quot;I have nothing at all to do with it,&quot; he said &quot;it is quite a child of Mr. Broome&#x27;s and he has acted the part of a good father to it.&quot; During 1826 the society&#x27;s debts became greater than its revenue, and Broome as the society&#x27;s guarantor was sentenced by the Kings Bench to the debtors&#x27; prison, and Martin and Gompertz raised funds to cover the debts and obtain Broome&#x27;s release. Martin maintained an interest in the Society even after he left England and resettled in France.

==Active life==
Martin also had a very eventful life. He was a colonel of the County Galway Volunteers. He survived two shipwrecks. He fought over a hundred duels with sword and pistol and earned the nickname &quot;Hairtrigger Dick&quot;. He travelled extensively in Europe and the Americas during the 1770s and was in New England when the American Revolutionary War began. He initiated Galway&#x27;s first theatre in 1783.

Martin was on a first-name basis with many of the famous names of his age, including King George IV (who gave him the nickname &quot;Humanity Dick&quot;), Henry Flood, Henry Grattan, William Pitt, Queen Caroline, and Daniel O&#x27;Connell. Despite his nickname he was considered a very harsh landlord in Ireland.

On his death in 1834 his son Thomas became his heir. A workhouse was built on his estate during the Irish famine. Although the workhouse was an apparent pledge to help the poor suffering from starvation, it is agreed that Thomas and his family did little to help and approximately 150,000 people died on their land during this period from starvation and fever. Most of Martin&#x27;s estate (approx. 200,000 acres (809 km2)) was in the west of Ireland and this area had one of the highest death tolls during the Famine.

==Unseating and escape==
After the election of 1826, Martin (now a heavy gambler) lost his parliamentary seat because of a petition which accused him of illegal voter intimidation during the election. He had to flee into hasty exile to Boulogne, France, because he could no longer invoke parliamentary immunity to avoid arrest for debt. He died there peacefully in the presence of his second wife and their three daughters on 6 January 1834.

==Family==
Martin&#x27;s first wife was the Honourable Elizabeth Vesey, a daughter of Lord Trimlestown. They had nine children, of whom only three survived childhood. His daughter, Mary, was born in 1783. Her brothers were Thomas B. Martin (1786–1847) and St. George (died 1805). Following the revelation of her affair with a Mr. Petrie in Paris, Martin sued Petrie for criminal conversation in 1791 and was awarded £10,000. He had this distributed to the poor by throwing it out the windows of his coach on the long journey back from London to Galway.

In 1793, he married the novelist Harriet Evans Martin in Nenagh. They had four surviving children, including Rev. Richard Martin (1797–1878) and the writer Harriet Letitia Martin (1801–1891). The former emigrated to Canada in 1834 and had descendants who included D&#x27;Arcy Argue Counsell Martin (c. 1899–1992). During the period of the family&#x27;s exile in Boulogne they became well acquainted with the poet Sarah Burdett (herself a relative of Baroness Burdett-Coutts 1814–1906) and she wrote a poem on 12 April 1834 expressing admiration and blessings on Mary Jane Martin (Richard&#x27;s daughter born in 1810). Burdett was an early supporter of the RSPCA and had her views published in 1839 in &quot;The Rights of Animals&quot;.

<text>143 Adria is a fairly large main-belt asteroid that was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa on 23 February 1875, at the Austrian Naval Observatory, and named after the Adriatic Sea, on the coast of which the discovery was made. This dark-coloured asteroid has probably a primitive carbonaceous chondritic composition.

One occultation by Adria has been reported so far, from Japan on August 21, 2000. A somewhat spherical shape measuring 98 × 86 km was observed.

Photometric observations of this asteroid made during 2008 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico gave an irregular light curve with a period of 22.005 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.08 ± 0.01 in magnitude.

<doc id="743928" wikidata="Q5542702" url="?curid=743928" title="George Munro (philanthropist)">
<text>George Munro (November 12, 1825 – April 23, 1896) was a Canadian dime novel publisher and philanthropist, best known for his financial support for Dalhousie University.

Born in Nova Scotia, Munro moved to New York City in 1856 to pursue a career in publishing. In 1877, he found commercial success in the &quot;Seaside Library&quot;, a low-cost journal that reprinted novels. Munro donated $500,000 to Dalhousie University over the course of his life, supporting professorships and scholarships and saving the university from closure.

== Early life and education ==
Munro was born in West River, Nova Scotia, on November 12, 1825. He was the fourth of ten or twelve children, to parents John Munro and Mary Mathieson.

Aged 12, Munro became an apprentice at a local newspaper known as &quot;The Observer&quot;. He left to continue his education in New Glasgow from 1839 to 1842, thereafter becoming a teacher. In 1844, Munro enrolled at the Pictou Academy.

== Career ==

=== Teaching ===
Following the completion of his studies at the Pictou Academy in 1847, Munro returned to New Glasgow to teach at his former school.

In 1850, Munro moved to Halifax, where he taught natural philosophy and mathematics at the Free Church Academy. He was appointed as Rector two years later. He completed a course in theology, and intended to enter ordained ministry. According to one rumour, Munro &quot;preached one sermon and made a solemn vow never to renew the ordeal&quot;.

=== Publishing industry ===
In October 1856, Munro moved to New York City. He first worked for D. Appleton &amp; Company, where he was involved in mail order and distribution for British magazines and books. In 1862, he moved to Ross and Tousey, which would become the American News Company. At this time, Munro began to grow interested in publishing dime novels: reprints of popular works in cheap journals.

Between 1863 and 1866, Munro worked for Beadle and Company. He entered a brief partnership with Irwin Beadle, brother of Erastus Flavel Beadle, a pioneer of pulp fiction; Munro became the company&#x27;s sole owner a year later.

In 1867, Munro began to publish the &quot;Fireside Companion&quot;, his own weekly story-paper. This was his first notable success, with readers and contributors in Nova Scotia.

=== &quot;Seaside Library&quot; ===
In May 1877, Munro began publishing the &quot;Seaside Library&quot;, a low-cost weekly journal reprinting novels, beginning with &quot;East Lynne&quot; by Henry Wood. The name imitated &quot;Lakeside Library&quot;, a rival journal published by R.R. Donnelley; Munro would later buy the publication.

In time, &quot;Seaside Library&quot; expanded to include history, biography, travel, and religious works. It was popular, with up to eighteen numbers weekly, totalling over 3,000 numbers over the course of the journal&#x27;s life. In 1881, the Seaside Library published its thousandth number: the Revised New Testament, with Constantin von Tischendorf&#x27;s introduction.

&quot;Seaside Library&quot; is credited for improving the accessibility and affordability of literature in the United States. Like his contemporaries publishing before the advent of international copyright laws, Munro did not pay royalties to authors he republished. Munro invested his wealth from the publication in a large printing plant and New York real estate.

== Philanthropy ==
In 1879, Munro made a substantial donation to Dalhousie University. His brother-in-law, John Forrest, was a member of the Board of Governors, while Munro&#x27;s son, George William, had studied there between 1874 and 1878. Munro had been staying with Forrest at Forrest&#x27;s residence in Brunswick Street, Halifax, during a long summer break, and proposed to fund a chair in Physics if the university could find a suitable appointment. At the time of Munro&#x27;s donation, Dalhousie University&#x27;s annual income was only $6,600, and there was significant discussion about the possibility of its closure. The university had only began to operate continuously in 1963.

Munro&#x27;s first endowed chair was the chair of Physics, which was awarded to James Gordon MacGregor. In 1880, he funded a chair of history and political economy, on the condition that it would be awarded to Forrest, who would become the university&#x27;s third president in 1885. Further chairs followed in English literature and philosophy in 1882 (for which he nominated his future son-in-law, Jacob Gould Schurman), constitutional and international law in 1883 (for which he nominated Richard Chapman Weldon and inaugurated the Dalhousie Law School), and English in 1884. The salaries attached to these chairs, ranging from $2,000 to $2,500, were twice those of regional professionals.

Munro also supported tutorships and scholarships at Dalhousie University across a range of subjects. Munro&#x27;s second son, John, matriculated at Dalhousie University in 1885; by then, his father was supporting a third of the university&#x27;s faculty members and students. Munro supported its first two female students, who matriculated at Dalhousie in 1881, and more than half of the university&#x27;s first 25 female graduates.

At the time of his death in 1896, Munro&#x27;s annual donations to Dalhousie University amounted to $25,000. He had donated a total of $500,000 over the course of his life (about $8 million in 1999). Though Munro did not bequeath money to Dalhousie University in his will, the Board of Governors made a claim against his estate for promissory notes that secured an additional $82,000 to the George Munro Trust Fund, which had been established in 1893 to manage his donations.

Munro was also a benefactor of the City University of New York, where he was a member of the Board of Governors, to Halifax&#x27;s Citizens&#x27; Free Library, to the reading-room of the Amalgamated Trades Union, and to his church: he was a &quot;liberal-minded Presbyterian&quot;.

== Death ==
Munro died from heart failure in Pine Hill, New York, on April 23, 1896, while attending repairs at his country home in the Catskills. Since 1864, he had been married to Catherine Forrest, and had two sons and two daughters. His eldest son, George William, was from a previous marriage from 1855 with Rachael Warren, who died in 1863.

== Munro Day ==
In 1881, students at Dalhousie University asked that the third Wednesday in January be a designated holiday for George Munro. The holiday, then named George Munro Memorial Day, later moved to the first Friday in February, when &#x27;Munro Day&#x27; is still celebrated today. It became tradition for students to sleigh-ride along the Bedford Basin on the holiday, followed by a fancy dinner; winter sports are still associated with the day. Over the course of the university&#x27;s history, other activities associated with Munro Day included varsity games, musical performances, and ice skating.

<text>The Boscombe Bowmen is the name given by archaeologists to a group of early Bronze Age (Bell Beaker) people found in a shared burial at Boscombe Down in Amesbury () near Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England.

==Discovery==
The burials were found in 2003 during roadworks being carried out on behalf of Qinetiq, the contractor that operates the Boscombe Down military airfield. The site is near a group of houses (known as Lower Camp) in Amesbury which are associated with the airfield (which lies to the east).

==The burials==
The grave contained the remains of at least nine individuals including several juveniles, five adult males and the cremated remains of an infant. Analysis of the skulls suggests that the men and the teenager were related to each other. The eldest man was buried in a crouched position with the bones of the others scattered around him, and their skulls resting at his feet. They became known as the Bowmen because several flint arrowheads were placed in the grave. Other grave goods included a boar&#x27;s tusk, a bone toggle, flint tools, and eight Beaker vessels; an unusually high number.

The burials are thought to date from around 2500 - 2200 BCE, making them broadly contemporary with the Amesbury Archer who had been found the year before about half a kilometre to the south. The broad date range is an artefact of the ranges of radiocarbon dates for different remains and archaeologists believe the grave was in use over a much shorter timescale of 25–50 years.

==Analysis==
Lead isotope analysis of the men&#x27;s teeth has indicated that they grew up in the areas either of modern Wales or in the Lake District, but left in childhood. This was at first thought to be contemporary with the major building work of erecting the sarsen circle and the trilithons at Stonehenge but research published in 2007 indicates that these burials occurred shortly after Stonehenge Phase 3ii.

The finds are on display at the Wessex Gallery of Archaeology, which opened at the Salisbury Museum in 2014.

==In popular culture==
The bowmen feature as characters in Mark Patton&#x27;s novel &quot;Undreamed Shores&quot;, and part of the storyline is based on the circumstances of their burial.

<text>The Chiesa di San Nicolò da Tolentino, commonly known as the Tolentini, is a church in the sestiere of Santa Croce in Venice, northern Italy. It lies in a Campo of the same name and along the Rio dei Tolentini, near the Giardino Papadopoli.

==History==
The Theatines arrived in Venice in 1527 after the Sack of Rome. The church dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Tolentino was begun in 1590 by Vincenzo Scamozzi. The relationship between Scamozzi and his patrons was stormy, and the church was finally completed only in 1714. It is a large church with a huge freestanding Corinthian portico, the only one in Venice, designed by Andrea Tirali.

The Tolentini is a parish church of the Vicariate of San Polo-Santa Croce-Dorsoduro. The church contains the tomb of Doge Giovanni I Corner, Francesco Corner, Giovanni II Corner, and Paolo Renier. The baroque organ was constructed by Pietro Nacchini in 1754. 

Annexed to the church was the monastery, now site of the architecture university of Ca’ Foscari. In 1966 Carlo Scarpa worked on creating an entrance for the institute.

==Works of art==
The high altar is by Baldassare Longhena. In 1627, Johann Liss painted a large altarpiece, the &quot;Inspiration of Saint Jerome&quot; to the left of chancel. In 1629 Bernardo Strozzi painted &quot;St Lawrence Giving Alms&quot; for the chancel.

The funereal monument of the Patriarch of Venice, Giovan Francesco Morosini (d.1678) in the chancel, was completed by the Genovese sculptor Filippo Parodi.

<text>Esther Hobart Morris (August 8, 1814 – April 2, 1902) was an American judge who was the first woman justice of the peace in the United States. She began her tenure as justice in South Pass City, Wyoming, on February 14, 1870, serving a term of nearly nine months. The Sweetwater County Board of County Commissioners appointed Morris as justice of the peace after the previous justice, R. S. Barr, resigned in protest of Wyoming Territory&#x27;s passage of the women&#x27;s suffrage amendment in December 1869.

Popular stories and historical accounts, as well as by state and federal public monuments, point to Morris as a leader in the passage of Wyoming&#x27;s suffrage amendment. However, Morris&#x27;s leadership role in the legislation is disputed. Morris herself never claimed any credit, ascribing the bill entirely to William H. Bright, who was member of the territorial legislature from South Pass City and President of the Territorial Council.

==Early life==
Esther Hobart McQuigg was born in the village of Spencer, Tioga County, New York, on August 8, 1814. It has been incorrectly reported she was orphaned at an early age. She actually grew up in a large family. Her mother died when Esther was fourteen, but she continued to live with her father, grandmother and siblings until age twenty-one. Esther then moved to the town of Owego and set up a millinery business.

Esther married Artemus Slack, an engineer for the railroad, in 1841. In May 1843, her husband died. Angry with the New York laws prohibiting women from owning property, Esther moved to Illinois, where her late husband had acquired property. In 1846 Esther Slack married John Morris in Ottawa, Illinois. They subsequently settled in Peru, Illinois where she gave birth to a son John in 1849 and twins Robert and Edward in 1851. Young John died as a toddler.

In 1868 Esther&#x27;s husband John and her son Archibald &quot;Archy&quot; joined the throngs moving to South Pass City in Dakota Territory soon to become Wyoming Territory. They purchased mines and worked at various jobs making a place for Esther and the twins.

In 1869, Morris and her two 18-year-old twin sons, Robert and Edward, ventured west to rejoin the rest of their family. They first traveled by train to a waystation on the newly completed Transcontinental Railroad at Bryan, 15 miles from present-day Green River. From there, Morris and her boys continued north by stagecoach. They crossed the Sand Dunes before ascending a gradual mountain pass to the Sweetwater Mining District.
The dry, rocky landscape that confronted 55-year-old Morris as she stepped off the stage at South Pass City appeared startlingly different from the fertile landscape she had known in Illinois and New York. Instead, her new home at in elevation meant scratching out a living in a barren gulch at the mouth of canyon near the Continental Divide. The Morrises settled into a 24-foot-by-26-foot (7 × 9 m) log cabin with a sod roof that Esther&#x27;s oldest son had purchased.

Winters were brutal. South Pass area residents, whose population swelled to nearly 4,000 residents, according to one estimate, either left the camp for the winter or faced extreme isolation during the long winters. Both John Morris and Archy purchased interest in mining properties soon after their arrival, including the Mountain Jack, Grand Turk, Golden State, and Nellie Morgan lodes, according to historian Michael A. Massie.

Initially, prospects looked good in the midst of the gold rush, where the mines and adjoining businesses of South Pass City spurred employment for 2,000 workers during 1868 and 1869, according to a Stanford University study. But then came the bust. By 1870 most miners had left, leaving as few as 460 residents. By 1875 fewer than 100 remained.

==Justice of the peace in South Pass City==
Esther Morris had hardly settled in her new home in South Pass City when District Court Judge John W. Kingman appointed her as justice of the peace in 1870. It took some &quot;prodding&quot; but Morris subsequently completed an application for the post and submitted a required $500 bond. The Sweetwater County Board of Commissioners in a vote of two to one approved her application on February 14, 1870.

Subsequently, the county clerk telegraphed a press release announcing the historic event of the first woman justice of the peace. The Wyoming Territory&#x27;s enfranchisement of women to vote in 1869 made Morris&#x27;s unprecedented appointment possible. The clerk&#x27;s telegraph to the world in part read:Wyoming, the youngest and one of the richest Territories in the United States, gave equal rights to women in actions as well as words.

Morris&#x27;s momentous appointment followed the resignation of Justice R. S. Barr, who quit in protest of the territorial legislature&#x27;s passage of the women&#x27;s suffrage amendment in December 1869. However, according to author Lynne Cheney writing in &quot;American Heritage&quot;, the county board appointed Morris to complete the term of Judge J. W. Stillman. Her appointment was challenged, but ultimately, her tenure was upheld.

Morris began her tenure as justice in South Pass City in 1870 by arresting Stillman, who refused to hand over his court docket. Ultimately, Morris dismissed her own case with a ruling that she as an interested party did not have the authority to arrest Stillman, according to author Lynne Cheney. Morris began anew with her own docket, holding court sitting on a wood slab in the living room of her log cabin. Cheney notes: When the lawyers who appeared in her court tried to embarrass her with legal terms and technicalities, she admitted her lack of training but was quick to let them know just whose court they were in. One of the lawyers who practiced before her recalled that &quot;to pettifoggers, she showed no mercy.&quot;

Morris looked to her sons for support in the courtroom. She appointed Archibald as district clerk and Robert as a part-time deputy clerk with the tasks of keeping court records and drawing up arrest warrants. Her husband John&#x27;s support was not so forthcoming. John actively opposed his wife&#x27;s appointment and reportedly made such a scene in her court that Esther had him jailed.

Judge Morris ruled on 27 cases during her more than eight months in office, including nine criminal cases. None were overturned according to records at the Wyoming State Archives, although a few cases were appealed but upheld by the appellate court. She held her justice of the peace post until the term that she had been appointed to fill expired on December 6, 1870. Morris sought reelection but failed to muster a nomination from either the Republican or Democratic parties.

Morris&#x27;s historic judgeship garnered favorable review upon the completion of her term in the &quot;South Pass News&quot;, as her son Archy was the editor. However, the historical record reveals little fanfare in the remainder of Wyoming&#x27;s press. The &quot;Wyoming Tribune&quot;, published in Cheyenne, did note the comments of Territorial Secretary Lee: &quot;the people of Sweetwater County had not the good sense and judgment to nominate and elect her for the ensuing term.&quot;

==The boom goes bust==
Esther Morris, as a working mother, held court over a camp of miners, gamblers, speculators, business owners, prostitutes, and rounders. Men outnumbered women 4 to 1 in the mountain community where she lived. The challenges in the court dealing with a rough constituency were compounded by her husband, John, who had a reputation as &quot;a brawler, an idler, and a drunk.&quot; Morris had him arrested, after her term in office was over, for assault and battery, according to the &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine.

Troubles continued to mount for the family. An 1871 fire struck the South Pass City newspaper office owned and operated by Esther Morris&#x27;s son, Archibald Slack, forcing him and his wife Sarah to move to Laramie in Albany County. Shortly after her son&#x27;s departure and a particularly bad winter in 1871–72, Morris left her husband and the camp. Morris traveled to Laramie, where she briefly lived with her son Archy; however, the former judge remained unsettled. She moved to Albany, New York, then to Springfield, Illinois, where she spent her winters, according to Massie. Summers saw her returning to Wyoming, where she spent time with her sons. Morris&#x27;s wandering ended in the 1880s when she returned to Cheyenne to live with her son Robert.

Morris had been but one of many in a long history of residents who saddled up and called it quits in South Pass City. Short-lived gold strikes in the 1880s, 1890s, and 1930s once again lured miners back to the mountains seeking their fortunes.

==Life after the mines==
After Wyoming&#x27;s enactment of women&#x27;s suffrage in 1869, the territory&#x27;s appointment of Morris as the first woman justice of the peace in the United States in 1870, and the first woman to hold judicial office in the modern world, drew widespread national attention.

Morris&#x27;s involvement in women&#x27;s causes also continued after she left the gold mines and South Pass City:
* February 1872: She participated in the American Woman Suffrage Association Convention in San Francisco.
* August 1873: Nominated by the Woman&#x27;s Party of Wyoming as a candidate to the Wyoming Territorial Legislature, a nomination that Morris declined.
* 1876: Served as vice president, National American Woman Suffrage Association.
* July 1876: Addressed the National Suffrage Convention in Philadelphia.
* July 1890: Presented the new Wyoming state flag to Governor Warren during the Wyoming statehood celebration.
* 1896: Attended as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri, which nominated the William McKinley-Garret A. Hobart ticket. (She was not related to Vice President Hobart, who died in office in 1899.)

==Death and legacy==
Esther Hobart Morris died in Cheyenne on April 2, 1902. Since 1960, a statue of her sculpted by Avard Fairbanks has been one of Wyoming&#x27;s two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol. Another statue stands at the Wyoming State Capitol. In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote a belated obituary for her.

===Role in women&#x27;s suffrage===
Evidence suggests that the public record celebrating Morris&#x27;s role as a suffrage leader is largely fabrication. Reports of Morris as suffragist in South Pass City, where she was said to have hosted a momentous tea party for the electors and candidates for Wyoming&#x27;s first territorial legislature, are not supported by any contemporary accounts, and only appear nearly fifty years after the fact.

For many years, Esther Hobart Morris has been celebrated as the &quot;Mother of Woman Suffrage&quot;. The legislation had been written a year before she became a justice of the peace, by Civil War veteran and South Pass City resident William H. Bright.

Many commenters opposing the women&#x27;s suffrage movement viewed Morris&#x27;s appointment as a &quot;dangerous&quot; sign of things to come. Some newspaper columns even opined that more women holding office would cause women to become a &quot;third sex&quot; and unsettle gender expectations. On the other side of the debate, suffragists often pointed to Morris&#x27;s appointment as evidence of women&#x27;s ability to hold office.

;Melville C. Brown&#x27;s recollection of the 1889 Constitutional Convention
Some modern-day researchers have suggested that Morris&#x27;s oldest son, who became editor of a Cheyenne newspaper, may have played a role in the origins of the story of his mother&#x27;s role. Critics say that he &quot;concocted it&quot;. Other research leads to Morris&#x27;s friend Melville C. Brown, who was president of the 1889 Constitutional Convention in Cheyenne, who claimed that she had presented the suffrage bill to the legislature. Morris&#x27;s son Archy Slack followed suit and subsequently referred to his mother in the &quot;Cheyenne Sun&quot; newspaper as the &quot;Mother of Suffrage&quot;.

;H.G. Nickerson&#x27;s recollection of a tea party
The tea party story might have faded quietly were it not for H.G. Nickerson. Nickerson, who had discovered and opened the Bullion Mine in 1868, later served as a territorial legislator for Lander. He wrote a letter published on February 14, 1919 in &quot;Wyoming State Journal&quot;, in which he recounted the tea party and his attendance as a legislative candidate, some 50 years after the event had taken place. In a tip of the hat honoring Morris, Nickerson notes:To Mrs. Esther Morris is due the credit and honor of advocating and originating woman&#x27;s suffrage in the United States.

Nickerson&#x27;s story gained widespread prominence after his friend, Wyoming historian Grace Raymond Hebard (1861–1936) published the account in a 1920 pamphlet entitled &quot;How Woman Suffrage Came to Wyoming (1869)&quot;. The pamphlet eventually became so widely distributed that students throughout the state&#x27;s public schools read the story memorializing Morris&#x27;s suffrage feats. Hebard spent many years advancing the claim, promoting Morris as an instigator and co-author of Wyoming&#x27;s suffrage legislation.

===Statues at the capitol buildings in Cheyenne and Washington, D.C.===
In 1960, Wyoming further celebrated Morris as a key impetus of Wyoming suffrage by donating a life-sized bronze statue of her to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Officiating at the Statuary Hall ceremony were Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Richard Arnold Mullens (1918–2010), the president at the time of the Wyoming State Society.

In 1963, Wyoming officials placed a replica of the same 9 foot sculpture at the state capitol building in Cheyenne. An inscription thereon hails Morris as the &quot;Mother of Woman Suffrage&quot;. In 2006, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, inducted Morris, as a suffrage pathbreaker. The Cowgirl Hall of Fame claims that her &quot;influential efforts made it possible for women to vote in the Wyoming Territory in 1869.&quot;

===On &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;===
In 1960, the actress Bethel Leslie played Morris in an episode of the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews.

===Hall of fame===
In 1973, she was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

<text>A street sweeper or street cleaner is a person or machine that cleans streets.

People have worked in cities as &quot;sanitation workers&quot; since sanitation and waste removal became a priority. A street-sweeping person would use a broom and shovel to clean off litter, animal waste and filth that accumulated on streets. Later, water hoses were used to wash the streets.

Street sweepers as machines were created in the 19th century to do the job easier. Today, modern street sweepers are mounted on truck bodies and can vacuum debris that accumulates in streets.

== History ==

===Manual sweeping===

The need for rubbish to be removed from roads in built-up areas has existed for centuries.

Sometimes a local law in a town or city ordered the owner or occupier of each address to clean the length of that road that passed his address.

Sometimes when much traffic was horse-drawn vehicles or ridden horses, there were street cleaners who selectively removed horse droppings because of their value as fertilizer on nearby rural areas.

===Mechanical sweepers in the United Kingdom===

By the 1840s, Manchester, England, had become known as the first industrial city. Manchester had one of the largest textile industries of that time. As a result, the robust metropolis was said to be England&#x27;s unhealthiest place to live. In response to this unsanitary environment, Joseph Whitworth invented the mechanical street sweeper. The street sweeper was designed with the primary objective to remove rubbish from streets in order to maintain aesthetic goals and safety.

===Mechanical sweepers in the United States===
The very first street sweeping machine was patented in 1849 by its inventor, C.S. Bishop. For a long time, street sweepers were just rotating disks covered with wire bristles. These rotating disks served as mechanical brooms that swept the dirt on the streets.

The first self-propelled sweeper vehicle patented in the US, driven by a steam engine and intended for cleaning railroad tracks, was patented in 1868, patent No. 79606. Eureka C. Bowne was the first known woman to get a patent for a street sweeper, in 1879, patent No. 222447. &quot;Her success was great&quot;, wrote Matilda Joslyn Gage in The North American Review, volume 136, issue 318, May 1883.

In 1896, African-American inventor Charles Brooks improved on then-conventional street sweeping inventions by making the front brushes of different lengths, and by including a mechanism for collection and disposal of debris. The revolving front brushes could also be replaced with a scraper to remove snow or ice. Brooks was granted a U.S. patent for the invention in 1896. Most of the more than 300 street sweeper patents issued in the United States before 1900, including the one in Brooks&#x27; patent, had no engine on board. The wheels on the cart turned gears or chains which drove the brush and belt.
John M. Murphy called at the offices of American Tower and Tank Company in Elgin, Illinois, in the fall of 1911. He had a plan of a motor-driven pickup street sweeper. The American Tower and Tank Company had been formed in 1903 by Charles A. Whiting and James Todd. They called in a recently acquired silent partner, Daniel M. Todd, and it was decided to hire Murphy and begin the development of his idea. That started what has become the Elgin Sweeper Company.

After two years of trial, development, experimentation, and research, a sweeper was achieved which Murphy was satisfied performed all of the sweeping functions in the manner he had envisioned – one which partners James and Daniel M. Todd and Charles A. Whiting were willing to risk a reputation gained from 30 years&#x27; manufacturing experience.

In the fall of 1913, the city of Boise, Idaho, purchased the first Elgin Sweeper, following a demonstration. Boise Street Commissioner, Thomas Finegan, made a comparison showing a savings of $2,716.77 from the Elgin motorized sweeper when used rather than a horse-drawn sweeper.

Following its introduction and initial sales, Murphy continued improving his sweeper. In 1917, US patents were filed and issues for J. M. Murphy, Street Sweeping machine No. 1,239,293.

===Technological advancement===
The goal of simple debris removal did not change until the 1970s, when policymakers began to reflect concern for water quality. In the United States, the lag time in which street sweepers responded can be pinpointed to the Runoff Report of 1998. As older street sweepers were only effective in removing large particles of road debris, small particles of debris remained behind in large quantities. The remaining debris was not seen as an aesthetic issue because rain would wash them away. Today, small particles are known to carry a substantial portion of the stormwater pollutant load.

Street sweeping can be an effective measure in reducing pollutants in stormwater runoff. The Environmental Protection Agency considers street sweeping a best practice in protecting water quality.

=== Modern sweepers ===
Street sweepers are capable of collecting small particles of debris. Many street sweepers produced today are PM10 and PM2.5 certified, meaning that they are capable of collecting and holding particulate matter sized less than 10μm and even down to 2.5μm.

Despite advancements in street sweeping technology, the mechanical broom type street sweeper accounts for approximately 90 percent of all street sweepers used in the United States today. In 2018, Boschung, a Swiss street sweeper manufacturer, launched the Urban-Sweeper S2.0, the first fully electric street sweeper releasing zero emissions.

<doc id="743938" wikidata="Q139197" url="?curid=743938" title="144 Vibilia">
<text>144 Vibilia is a carbonaceous asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 140 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 3 June 1875, by German–American astronomer Christian Peters at Litchfield Observatory of the Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, United States. Peters named it after Vibilia, the Roman goddess of traveling, because he had recently returned from a journey across the world to observe the transit of Venus. Peters also discovered 145 Adeona on the same night. The official naming citation was published by Paul Herget in &quot;The Names of the Minor Planets&quot; in 1955 ().

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Vibilia&quot; is the largest member and namesake of the Vibilia family, a small asteroid family with 180 known members. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.0–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,582 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.23 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid&#x27;s observation arc begins in May 1905, at Heidelberg Observatory, 30 years after its official discovery observation. It never received a provisional designation.

144 Vibilia has been observed to occult a star eleven times between 1993 and 2018. Eight of these events yielded two or more chords across the asteroid.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Vibilia&quot; is a dark C-type asteroid in the Tholen taxonomy. It is also characterized as a hydrated Ch-subtype in the SMASS classification. This means it probably has a primitive carbonaceous composition.

13-cm radar observations of this asteroid from the Arecibo Observatory between 1980 and 1985 were used to produce a diameter estimate of 131 km. Carry gives a diameter of 141.34 kilometers. According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Vibilia&quot; measures between 131.36 and 142.38 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.05 0.06. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; (CALL) adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0597 and a diameter of 142.38 kilometers. CALL uses an absolute magnitude of 7.92.

Based upon radar data, the near surface solid density of &quot;Vibilia&quot; is 2.4. The density had been calibrated against that of 433 Eros; the uncalibrated figure is 3.2 g/cm3. Carry gives a density of with a low porosity.

Several well-defined rotational lightcurves of &quot;Vibilia&quot; have been obtained from photometric observations since the 1980s. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period between 13.810 and 13.88 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.13 and 0.20 magnitude (U=3/3/3/3). In 2016, an international study modeled a lightcurve from various photometric data sources. It gave a period of 13.82516 hours. The team also determined two spin axis of (248.0°, 56.0°) and (54.0°, 48.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β) (U/Q=n.a.).

<doc id="743939" wikidata="Q1415840" url="?curid=743939" title="Fimo">
<text>Fimo is a brand of polymer clay made by German company Staedtler (&quot;STAEDTLER Mars GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot;). Fimo is sold worldwide. Its main U.S. competitor is the American brand Sculpey. The material comes in many different colors; there are many finishes to choose from, and even a softener to use with it because it can be hard to work. It is used for making many objects, including jewelry, accessories, and small ornaments. Once shaped, Fimo is baked in a standard or toaster oven for about 30 minutes at 110 °C (230 °F) to harden it. Once baked, it can be cut, drilled, painted, sanded, and sliced thinly. According to information from Staedtler, Fimo contains polyvinyl chloride (PVC), but has not contained any phthalates since 2006.

== History ==
FIMO was first a plastic modeling compound brought to the attention of German dollmaker Käthe Kruse in 1939 as a possible replacement for plastic compounds. It was not suitable for her doll factory use, and she turned it over to her daughter Sophie Rehbinder-Kruse, who was known in the family as &quot;Fifi&quot; (hence &quot;FIMO&quot;, from &quot;Fifi&#x27;s Modeling Compound&quot;). The brand was later sold to Eberhard Faber and is marketed under the name &quot;FIMO&quot;.

== Techniques ==
Fimo and other polymer clay products can be worked in a variety of techniques:
; Sculpting: Fimo can be sculpted in ways similar to other modeling materials such as ceramic, modelling clay, and Play-Doh.
Sculptures can have glass beads and wire added before curing to provide additional detailing. Artists may also use armature wire to support their sculptures. Aluminum foil can be used to prop up large areas, where the foil is scrunched into a shape and then layered with Fimo. It is also possible to use glass objects as a base structure point to build up from.
; Marbling and color mixing: Because Fimo is packaged in colored blocks, the colors can be mixed while soft, then baked. By mixing two or more colors, then twisting, folding, bending, and cutting, assorted marbled surfaces can be obtained.
If multiple colors are mixed thoroughly enough, the marble effect will fade and the colors will blend to make a new color.
; Caning: Caning or caneworking, also known as millefiori, draws from a traditional glass technique where a two dimensional design is constructed in three dimensions, with the different colored elements of the design extending all the way through the form from the front surface to the back surface. Once the initial form is completed, the form, known as a &quot;cane,&quot; can be sliced (with the blade held parallel to the front surface) to produce a number of nearly identical copies of the design. Additionally, the form can be extended by squeezing or rolling the sides so that the form becomes longer from front to back, while becoming narrower in the other two dimensions. When the resulting form is sliced, the original design will be preserved, but lessen to a smaller size. This technique also allows a larger number of slices to be extracted from the same amount of clay. In glass work, the type of the material dictates that these be round, but with polymer clay the shapes can be more varied, although round and square canes are the most common because they are easiest to extend. Cylinders can be rolled out to a longer length very easily, while cubic forms can be squeezed on their four side surfaces. More complex shapes such as hexagons can be worked with, but it is difficult to extend complex shapes without distortion.
; Bull&#x27;s eye cane: The process used to create &quot;lacework&quot; with Polymer clay. This refers to a single color roll of Polymer clay, which is then wrapped in a secondary color. Rolling and compressing the two colors to make a perfect join is a known as a &quot;bull&#x27;s eye&quot;. Cutting this length of clay into even lengths and laying them on top of each other and re-rolling forms lacework.
; Beading: Polymer clay can be formed into beads or charms, with the holes punched before baking or drilled in afterwards.
; Polishing: Using 400-600 Wet and Dry Sandpaper, an artist can sand their project to create an extremely smooth polished effect. Whilst sanding, a small amount of water should be run over the cured project until desired effect is achieved. A hand-held drill such as a &quot;Dremel&quot; can also be used on a low-speed setting with a buffer pad, to create a more highly polished design.
; Mixed Media: Polymer clay also works well with Embossing Powders. Mixing them into Fimo clay can create a metallic marble effect. Glitter foil, powders, alcohol inks or fragments can be mixed in to create attractive effects when using the Fimo Translucent colors.

== Surface treatments ==
; Lacquer: Staedtler produced and sold Fimo-branded glossy lacquer, it has now been discontinued. The lacquers are thick liquids applied after baking. They dry to a hard finish that protects the clay as well as changing the surface texture. A matte finish lacquer was available for some portion of the 1980s and 1990s, but it has also been discontinued.
; Metallic powders: Staedtler produces and sells a number of Fimo-branded metallic powders for surface application.
; Paint: Fimo can be painted. Acrylic paints are best as oil based may not dry completely.

== Versions ==
Since the original product, Staedtler has introduced new forms of Fimo, causing the Fimo of the early 1990s to be sometimes called &quot;classic&quot; Fimo. Fimo Soft is easier to condition but not as strong as the original classic Fimo.

== Safety standards ==
Fimo conforms to the European Standard EN 71 part 5 and resembles the ACMI-Seal AP &quot;non toxic&quot; since 2018.

<text>The Chiesa di San Pantaleone Martire, known as San Pantalon in the Venetian language, is a church in the Dorsoduro &quot;sestiere&quot; of Venice, Italy. It is located on the Campo San Pantalon (square), and is dedicated to Saint Pantaleon.

The 17th-century Chiesa di San Pantalon is a parish church of the Vicariate of San Polo-Santa Croce-Dorsoduro.

==Architectural elements==
San Pantalon is particularly well known for its immense ceiling painting, depicting &quot;The Martyrdom and Apotheosis of St Pantalon&quot;. It was painted on canvas by Gian Antonio Fumiani between 1680 and 1704, when he fell to his death from the scaffolding, although some sources date his death to six years after he stopped work on the San Pantalon ceiling.

Other notable works include &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; by Antonio Vivarini and Giovanni d&#x27;Alemagna in the Chapel of the Holy Nail and &quot;St Pantalon healing a Boy&quot;, the last work by Veronese, originally commissioned for the high altar.

===Assessments of the Fumiani fresco===
Modern critics note that the dramatic sotto in su canvas marks the entry of Bolognese quadratura to Venice; Fumiani had studied with the perspective painter Domenico degli Ambrogi.

John Ruskin, in his typical disdain of all post-Quattrocento works, described the ceiling oil painting as a: 

John Crowley&#x27;s novel &quot;The Solitudes&quot;, his first volume in the Ægypt series, has an extended response to the painting.

<doc id="743950" wikidata="Q577204" url="?curid=743950" title="Greatest Hits (Björk album)">
<text>Greatest Hits is a compilation album by Icelandic musician and singer Björk, released on 4 November 2002 through One Little Indian. Although not all of Björk&#x27;s singles are included on this collection, all of the songs on &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; were released as singles. The tracks were selected by fans through a survey on Björk&#x27;s website. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; presents the songs in descending order of most-popular votes, with the exception of &quot;It&#x27;s in Our Hands&quot; which was a new song and appears at the end of the compilation.

==Information==
There were two online surveys preceding the release of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. The survey that gave the track list was one where fans voted for their favourite singles. Another one was conducted simultaneously where fans could vote for their favourite of all her songs, album tracks as well as B-sides. This sometimes is the cause for some confusion about the authenticity of the fan-selected track list concept because the results from the single-track survey does not always match with the overall survey. For example, &quot;Hyperballad&quot; was the song receiving most votes from Björk fans on the overall survey, but appears as the second track on &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. The results of both surveys can be seen on Björk&#x27;s website.

Several of the songs are presented in their radio (or single) remixed forms, most notably &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot; (the Fluke version featured in the promotional video, and not the shorter &quot;Minimix&quot; as featured on the single). &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; includes the famous electronic sounds that were temporarily deleted off the &quot;Post&quot; version of the track, and &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot; is presented in its single version.

As with many greatest hits compilation albums, some of Björk&#x27;s biggest singles were absent. The most obvious omission is &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot;, her highest-charting UK hit. Also missing are &quot;Alarm Call&quot;, &quot;I Miss You&quot;, &quot;Cocoon&quot; and &quot;Violently Happy&quot; as well as any pre-&quot;Debut&quot; material.

The tracks &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot;, and &quot;Venus as a Boy&quot; are taken from Björk&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Debut&quot;. &quot;Play Dead&quot; was originally released on the &quot;Young Americans&quot; movie soundtrack (1993) but was included on some editions of &quot;Debut&quot;.

&quot;Hyperballad&quot;, &quot;Army of Me&quot;, &quot;Isobel&quot;, and &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; are from the 1995 &quot;Post&quot; album. &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;, &quot;Jóga&quot;, &quot;Bachelorette&quot;, and &quot;Hunter&quot; are from her 1997 &quot;Homogenic&quot; album. Finally, &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot; and &quot;Hidden Place&quot; are found on her 2001 &quot;Vespertine&quot; album.

The artwork on the CD was produced in collaboration with Icelandic contemporary artist Gabríela Friðriksdóttir. It is the only one of Björk&#x27;s album covers that includes both a logo and a title.

&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released on the same day as Björk&#x27;s &quot;Family Tree&quot; box set, which contained a &quot;greatest hits&quot; disc on which the songs were chosen by Björk. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and the greatest hits &quot;as chosen by Björk&quot; have seven tracks in common.

The &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album was also listed on &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;500 CDs You Must Own&quot;.

<doc id="743958" wikidata="Q618719" url="?curid=743958" title="Asterix the Gaul">
<text>Asterix the Gaul () is a French comic story, written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo. First published by Dargaud as a serial for &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine in October 1959, it was later released as a comic album in 1961. The story focuses on a Gaul named Asterix, whose village resists Roman rule, as he attempts to rescue his village&#x27;s druid from a Roman garrison when its commander seeks to secure the secret of the village&#x27;s superhuman strength.

The story proved hugely popular with French readers, leading to Goscinny and Uderzo writing further stories that would go on to form the &quot;Asterix&quot; comic strip series, with international versions of the comic helping to broaden its appeal outside of France. Dargaud later developed an animated adaptation of the comic for theatrical release in 1967 with its own production company, though Goscinny and Uderzo disapproved of the poor animation quality; they later blocked a sequel based on their next story. Alongside the film, an audiobook adaptation was created by EMI Records.

In 1999 &quot;Asterix the Gaul&quot; was voted as the 23rd greatest book of the 20th century, in a poll conducted across France by French retailer Fnac and the Paris newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; for &quot;Le Monde&quot; 100 Books of the Century.

==Plot==
In 50 B.C., all of Gaul is under the control of the Romans, except for a small village in Armorica (present-day Brittany), whose inhabitants constantly hold back their forces through superhuman strength. Determined to uncover their secret, Centurion Crismus Bonus, commander of the camp of Compendium, sends a spy into the village. His spy soon reveals that the village&#x27;s druid, Getafix, periodically supplies the villagers with a magic potion that is the source of their strength. Amazed by this, Crismus Bonus orders Getafix to be captured, in order to gain control over the magic potion.

Asterix, a warrior from the village, learns of Getafix&#x27;s kidnapping from a cart-seller and decides to infiltrate the Roman camp to rescue him. Once inside the camp that evening, Asterix overhears Crismus Bonus talking with his second-in-command, Marcus Ginandtonicus, about his plans to use the magic potion to initiate a rebellion against Rome that will overthrow Julius Caesar. When Asterix finds Getafix, he informs him of what he learnt and comes up with a plan to prevent this from happening.

The following morning Asterix lets himself be captured and pretends to give in to torture, whereupon Getafix pretends to give in and agree to make the potion. After securing the ingredients he needs, Getafix tricks Crismus Bonus that he needs strawberries, only for him and Asterix to consume them all once the Romans find some. Eventually, Getafix uses the ingredients he collected to brew a potion which he tricks Crismus Bonus and the Romans to drink, unaware it will cause their hair and beards to grow at an accelerated rate.

After tricking Crismus Bonus to let them gather ingredients for an &quot;antidote&quot; (despite the effects of the lotion wearing off after a day), Getafix supplies the camp with vegetable soup. However, he secretly collects the ingredients needed for the magic potion, which Asterix uses to help them escape from their captors. Before they make for their village, the pair discover Roman reinforcements have arrived, led by Caesar, who becomes suspicious about what has recently occurred in Compendium. Asterix soon exposes Crismus Bonus&#x27; intentions, prompting Caesar to exile him and his men to Outer Mongolia for their treachery, while allowing the Gauls to leave on the grounds of a truce. Asterix and Getafix eventually return to their village, which celebrates by holding a banquet for their success.

==Characters==
* Asterix – Gaulish warrior, and the main protagonist of the story.
* Obelix – Gaulish menhir delivery man and warrior, and a close friend of Asterix. Although having a minor role in this story, the character would later gain more prominence in the comic series.
* Getafix – Gaulish druid. Several aspects of the character, such as his appearance as a sterotupical caveman, were later changed by Goscinny and Uderzo for subsequent novels.
* Vitalstatistix – Chief of the Gaulish village, with a great fear of the sky falling on his head - a notion conceived by Goscinny and Uderzo through real-life historical account of an interview of Gallic chieftains by the Romans.
* Cacofonix – Gaulish bard of the village.
* Fulliautomatix – Gaulish blacksmith.
* Julius Caesar – Leader of Rome in 50 B.C. (based upon the historical version of the real-life Roman figure). Following the novel, the character&#x27;s appearance was changed to better reflect his historical counterpart.
* Crismus Bonus – Roman Centurion in charge of Camp Compendium.
* Marcus Ginandtonicus – Second-in-command at Compendium. The character&#x27;s design was oddly altered a few pages after they first appear in the novel.
* Caligula Minus – A Roman soldier at Compendium, assigned to spy on the Gaulish village.

==Publishing history==
The story was first published as a serial in &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine, a Franco-Belgian comics magazine founded by Goscinny and a few other comic artists.

The first page appeared in the promotional issue #0, distributed on 1 June 1959, and the story was serially published in the magazine from issue #1 (29 October 1959) until issue #38 (14 July 1960). A small head of Asterix first appeared on the cover of #9 (24 December 1959), and a full Asterix cover was used on #21 (17 March 1960).

The next story, &quot;Asterix and the Golden Sickle&quot;, started in issue #42 (11 August 1960).

&quot;Asterix le Gaulois&quot; was published in July 1961 by Dargaud in the so-called &quot;Pilote collection&quot; with a print of 6000 copies. A Dutch translation followed in 1966, and other languages followed soon after.

The English translation by Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge was first published in 1969 by Brockhampton Press.

The plate for page 35 was redrawn by Albert Uderzo&#x27;s brother Marcel in 1970 because the original was lost. This is why there are some slight differences in the drawing style. All English versions from Hodder &amp; Stoughton (Hodder Dargaud) use the original illustrations, which were made from a copy of an actual printed page, hence the blurriness. The 2004 release from Orion Books uses the redone illustrations from the French editions.

An audiobook of &quot;Asterix the Gaul&quot; adapted by Anthea Bell and narrated by Willie Rushton was released on EMI Records &quot;Listen for Pleasure&quot; label in 1990.

On 29 October 2009, Google prominently featured an integration of Asterix and Obelix in its mast head, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first publication.

The 2019 American Papercutz edition presents a few changes:
* Getafix is named Panoramix, the same name used in the original French edition. 
* The Roman Camps of Totorum and Compendium are renamed to Butterdrum and Lilchum, respectively.
* The original decurion&#x27;s name is changed from Julius Pompus to Julius Pompilius. 
* It changes all references to the Circus Maximus to the Colosseum, even though in the timeline it wouldn&#x27;t be built for another 120 years.

==Film adaptation==
In 1967, Dargaud released an animated adaptation of the novel, under the same name, for theatrical release - though originally, the company planned for it to air on French television. However, the film was made without consultation with Goscinny and Uderzo, who were unaware of its production until a few months before its release date. Neither approved of the quality of the animation by the team Dargaud employed, and later blocked the company from making a planned adaptation of &quot;Asterix and the Golden Sickle&quot;, only allowing for further adaptations on the grounds that they had involvement in future animated films for Dargaud.

<text>Teriparatide, sold under the brand name Forteo, is a form of parathyroid hormone (PTH) consisting of the first (N-terminus) 34 amino acids, which is the bioactive portion of the hormone. It is an effective anabolic (promoting bone formation) agent used in the treatment of some forms of osteoporosis. Teriparatide is a recombinant human parathyroid hormone analog (PTH 1-34). It has an identical sequence to the 34 N-terminal amino acids of the 84-amino acid human parathyroid hormone.

==Medical uses==
Teriparatide is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis; for the increase of bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis; and treatment of men and women with osteoporosis associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy.

It is effective in growing bone (e.g., 8% increase in bone density in the spine after one year) and reducing the risk of fragility fractures.

Teriparatide cuts the risk of hip fracture by more than half but does not reduce the risk of arm or wrist fracture.

==Contraindications==
Teriparatide is contraindicated for those with open epiphyses, metabolic bone diseases, Paget&#x27;s Disease of bone, bone metastases, history of skeletal malignancies, or prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton. In the animal studies and in one human case report, it was found to potentially be associated with developing osteosarcoma in test subjects after over two years of use.

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects of teriparatide include headache, nausea, dizziness, and limb pain. Teriparatide has a theoretical risk of osteosarcoma, which was found in rat studies but not confirmed in humans. This may be because, unlike humans, rat bones grow for their entire life. The tumors found in the rat studies were located on the end of the bones which grew after the injections began. After nine years on the market, there were only two cases of osteosarcoma reported. This risk was considered by the FDA as &quot;extremely rare&quot; (1 in 100,000 people) and is only slightly more than the incidence in the population over 60 years old (0.4 in 100,000).
==Mechanism of action==
Teriparatide is a portion of human parathyroid hormone (PTH), amino acid sequence 1 through 34, of the complete molecule (containing 84 amino acids). Endogenous PTH is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. PTH increases serum calcium, partially accomplishing this by increasing bone resorption. Thus, chronically elevated PTH will deplete bone stores. However, intermittent exposure to PTH will activate osteoblasts more than osteoclasts. Thus, once-daily injections of teriparatide have a net effect of stimulating new bone formation leading to increased bone mineral density.

== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
Teriparatide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1987. Teriparatide (Forteo) was approved by the FDA in November 2002, for the treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women who are at high risk for having a fracture. In October 2019, the US FDA approved the recombinant teriparatide product with brand name Bonsity.

=== Biosimilars ===
Recombinant teriparatide is sold by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand names Forteo and Forsteo. In June 2020, Alvogen, Inc, Pfenex Inc.&#x27;s commercialization partner, launched teriparatide injection (Bonsity) in the United States. Teriparatide injection was developed by Pfenex Inc and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2019. Teriparatide injection is pharmaceutically equivalent to Forteo (that is, has the same active ingredient in the same strength, dosage form and route of administration) and has been shown to have comparable bioavailability. These characteristics allowed the product to be approved under a 505(b)(2) NDA for which Forteo was the reference drug. It may provide a lower-cost teriparatide option for increasing bone density in patients at high risk for fracture, and is FDA-approved for the same indications as Forteo, which means it can be used for the same patients as Forteo, including new patients and those currently responding to treatment.

Teriparatide was approved for medical use in the European Union in June 2003. A synthetic teriparatide from Teva Generics has been authorized for marketing in the European Union. Biosimilar product from Gedeon Richter plc has been authorized in the European Union. In October 2019, the US FDA approved a recombinant teriparatide product.

In June 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the approval of the biosimilar products Qutavina and Livogiva. Qutavina and Livogiva were approved for medical use in the European Union in August 2020.

Osnuvo was approved for medical use in Canada in January 2020.

Sondelbay was approved for medical use in the European Union in March 2022.

On 10 November 2022, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Kauliv, intended for the treatment of osteoporosis. The applicant for this medicinal product is Strides Pharma Cyprus. Kauliv was approved for medical use in the European Union in February 2023.

== Research ==
Teriparatide is undergoing a clinical trial with zoledronic acid as a treatment for osteogenesis imperfecta to reduce the risk of broken bones.

=== Combined teriparatide and denosumab ===
Combined teriparatide and denosumab increased BMD more than either agent alone and more than has been reported with approved therapies. Combination treatment might, therefore, be useful to treat patients at high risk of fracture by increasing BMD. However, there is no evidence of fracture rate reduction in patients taking a teriparatide and denosumab combination. The first such trial was published by Leder et al. in Lancet in 2013 with further data subsequently published in JCEM in a trial of post menopausal osteoporotic women demonstrating larger bone mineral density increases in the spine and hip with combination therapy compared to either drug alone.

<text>Carlos Alberto Gomes Parreira (born 27 February 1943) is a Brazilian former football manager who holds the record for attending the most FIFA World Cup final tournaments as manager with six appearances. He also managed five different national teams in five editions of the FIFA World Cup. He managed Brazil to victory at the 1994 World Cup, the 2004 Copa América, and the 2005 Confederations Cup. He is also the only manager to have led two different Asian teams to conquer the AFC Asian Cup.

He last managed the South Africa national football team.

Parreira is one of the most successful managers to have never played football himself.

==Coaching career==
Parreira supports Fluminense, and he has won two league titles for the club: The First Division Brazilian Championship in 1984 and the Third Division in 1999. About the latter title, Parreira has said that this was personally the most important trophy of his career, even more so than Brazil&#x27;s World Cup triumph, as the club he loved was facing near-bankruptcy and became very close to extinction at the time.

Parreira is one of two coaches that has led five national teams to the World Cup: Kuwait in 1982, United Arab Emirates in 1990, Brazil in 1994 and 2006, Saudi Arabia in 1998 and South Africa in 2010. The other coach, Bora Milutinović, reached this record when he led a fifth team in 2002. Parreira was also involved with the 1970 championship team for Brazil, which he claims was an inspiration for him to aspire to be a national football coach.

In 1997, Parreira coached the MetroStars of the American Major League Soccer. He also coached Fenerbahçe in Turkey and won a Turkish League Championship. Parreira was in charge of Corinthians in 2002, which gave him two of the most important national trophies of 2002: The Brazilian Cup and the Torneio Rio-São Paulo, besides being runner up at the Brazilian League.

When coaching Saudi Arabia at the 1998 World Cup in France, he was fired after two matches, one of three managers to be sacked during the tournament.

Parreira repeatedly turned down offers to coach Brazil again between 1998 and 2002 World Cups. In end of 2000, when the team was in turmoil after firing Vanderlei Luxemburgo, he refused the post, stating that he did not want to relive the stress and pressure of winning the World Cup again. There were public cries again to replace Luiz Felipe Scolari for Parreira in July 2001 when Brazil lost two matches to Mexico and Honduras in its title defense at the 2001 Copa América in Colombia, especially after last minute invitee (replacing Argentina who dropped out one day before the kickoff) Honduras defeated 2–0 and eliminated the favorite Brazil in quarter finals round on July 23, 2001. Parreira only stated that he would indirectly assist Scolari in the 2002 campaign. After the 2002 World Cup, Parreira took part in drafting a technical report of the tournament. He was named coach along with Mario Zagallo as assistant director in January 2003, with the goal of defending their World Cup title in Germany 2006, but on July 1, 2006, Brazil was defeated and eliminated 0–1 by France in the quarterfinals.

After Brazil&#x27;s exit from the World Cup, Parreira was heavily criticized by the Brazilian public and media for playing an outdated brand of football and not using the players available to him properly. Parreira subsequently resigned on July 19, 2006. He coached Brazil to victory in the 1994 FIFA World Cup and was the coach of the South Africa national football team until resigning in April 2008. On October 22, 2009, it was announced he would return as head coach of South Africa. He announced a verbal agreement with the South African Football Association on October 23, 2009.

He resumed coaching South Africa in 2009 in time for the 2010 World Cup. In South Africa, his team drew with Mexico, 1–1, in the tournament opener, lost to Uruguay, 3–0, and beat France, 2–1, to finish third in Group A. After the France game, he tried to shake hands with French coach Raymond Domenech but the latter refused.

On 25 June 2010 he announced his retirement as football coach.

<text>146 Lucina is a main-belt asteroid that was discovered by Alphonse Borrelly on June 8, 1875, and named after Lucina, the Roman goddess of childbirth. It is large, dark and has a carbonaceous composition. The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration.

Photometric observations of this asteroid made during 1979 and 1981 gave a light curve with a period of 18.54 hours.

Two stellar occultations by Lucina have been observed so far, in 1982 and 1989. During the first event, a possible small satellite with an estimated 5.7 km diameter was detected at a distance of 1,600 km from 146 Lucina. A 1992 search using a CCD failed to discover a satellite larger than 0.6 km, although it may have been obscured by occultation mask. Further evidence for a satellite emerged in 2003, this time based on astrometric measurements.

<doc id="743971" wikidata="Q1128648" url="?curid=743971" title="Content-based image retrieval">
<text>Content-based image retrieval, also known as query by image content ([[#QBIC|QBIC]]) and content-based visual information retrieval (CBVIR), is the application of computer vision techniques to the image retrieval problem, that is, the problem of searching for digital images in large databases (see this survey for a scientific overview of the CBIR field). Content-based image retrieval is opposed to traditional concept-based approaches (see [[Concept-based image indexing]]).

&quot;Content-based&quot; means that the search analyzes the contents of the image rather than the metadata such as keywords, tags, or descriptions associated with the image. The term &quot;content&quot; in this context might refer to colors, shapes, textures, or any other information that can be derived from the image itself. CBIR is desirable because searches that rely purely on metadata are dependent on annotation quality and completeness.

==Comparison with metadata searching==
An image meta search requires humans to have manually annotated images by entering keywords or metadata in a large database, which can be time-consuming and may not capture the keywords desired to describe the image. The evaluation of the effectiveness of keyword image search is subjective and has not been well-defined. In the same regard, CBIR systems have similar challenges in defining success. &quot;Keywords also limit the scope of queries to the set of predetermined criteria.&quot; and, &quot;having been set up&quot; are less reliable than using the content itself.

==History==
The term &quot;content-based image retrieval&quot; seems to have originated in 1992 when it was used by Japanese Electrotechnical Laboratory engineer Toshikazu Kato to describe experiments into automatic retrieval of images from a database, based on the colors and shapes present. Since then, the term has been used to describe the process of retrieving desired images from a large collection on the basis of syntactical image features. The techniques, tools, and algorithms that are used originate from fields such as statistics, pattern recognition, signal processing, and computer vision.

=== - Query By Image Content===
The earliest commercial CBIR system was developed by IBM and was called QBIC (Query By Image Content). Recent network- and graph-based approaches have presented a simple and attractive alternative to existing methods.

While the storing of multiple images as part of a single entity preceded the term BLOB (Binary Large OBject), the ability to fully search by content, rather than by description, had to await IBM&#x27;s QBIC.
=== VisualRank ===
==Technical progress==
The interest in CBIR has grown because of the limitations inherent in metadata-based systems, as well as the large range of possible uses for efficient image retrieval. Textual information about images can be easily searched using existing technology, but this requires humans to manually describe each image in the database. This can be impractical for very large databases or for images that are generated automatically, e.g. those from surveillance cameras. It is also possible to miss images that use different synonyms in their descriptions. Systems based on categorizing images in semantic classes like &quot;cat&quot; as a subclass of &quot;animal&quot; can avoid the miscategorization problem, but will require more effort by a user to find images that might be &quot;cats&quot;, but are only classified as an &quot;animal&quot;. Many standards have been developed to categorize images, but all still face scaling and miscategorization issues.

Initial CBIR systems were developed to search databases based on image color, texture, and shape properties. After these systems were developed, the need for user-friendly interfaces became apparent. Therefore, efforts in the CBIR field started to include human-centered design that tried to meet the needs of the user performing the search. This typically means inclusion of: query methods that may allow descriptive semantics, queries that may involve user feedback, systems that may include machine learning, and systems that may understand user satisfaction levels.

==Techniques==
Many CBIR systems have been developed, but , the problem of retrieving images on the basis of their pixel content remains largely unsolved.

Different query techniques and implementations of CBIR make use of different types of user queries.

===Query By Example===
QBE (Query By Example) is a query technique that involves providing the CBIR system with an example image that it will then base its search upon. The underlying search algorithms may vary depending on the application, but result images should all share common elements with the provided example.

Options for providing example images to the system include:
* A preexisting image may be supplied by the user or chosen from a random set.
* The user draws a rough approximation of the image they are looking for, for example with blobs of color or general shapes.

This query technique removes the difficulties that can arise when trying to describe images with words.

===Semantic retrieval===
&quot;Semantic&quot; retrieval starts with a user making a request like &quot;find pictures of Abraham Lincoln&quot;. This type of open-ended task is very difficult for computers to perform - Lincoln may not always be facing the camera or in the same pose. Many CBIR systems therefore generally make use of lower-level features like texture, color, and shape. These features are either used in combination with interfaces that allow easier input of the criteria or with databases that have already been trained to match features (such as faces, fingerprints, or shape matching). However, in general, image retrieval requires human feedback in order to identify higher-level concepts.

===Relevance feedback (human interaction)===
Combining CBIR search techniques available with the wide range of potential users and their intent can be a difficult task. An aspect of making CBIR successful relies entirely on the ability to understand the user intent. CBIR systems can make use of &quot;relevance feedback&quot;, where the user progressively refines the search results by marking images in the results as &quot;relevant&quot;, &quot;not relevant&quot;, or &quot;neutral&quot; to the search query, then repeating the search with the new information. Examples of this type of interface have been developed.

===Iterative/machine learning===
Machine learning and application of iterative techniques are becoming more common in CBIR.

===Other query methods===
Other query methods include browsing for example images, navigating customized/hierarchical categories, querying by image region (rather than the entire image), querying by multiple example images, querying by visual sketch, querying by direct specification of image features, and multimodal queries (e.g. combining touch, voice, etc.)

==Content comparison using image distance measures==
The most common method for comparing two images in content-based image retrieval (typically an example image and an image from the database) is using an image distance measure. An image distance measure compares the similarity of two images in various dimensions such as color, texture, shape, and others. For example, a distance of 0 signifies an exact match with the query, with respect to the dimensions that were considered. As one may intuitively gather, a value greater than 0 indicates various degrees of similarities between the images. Search results then can be sorted based on their distance to the queried image. Many measures of image distance (Similarity Models) have been developed.

===Color===
Computing distance measures based on color similarity is achieved by computing a color histogram for each image that identifies the proportion of pixels within an image holding specific values. Examining images based on the colors they contain is one of the most widely used techniques because it can be completed without regard to image size or orientation. However, research has also attempted to segment color proportion by region and by spatial relationship among several color regions.

===Texture===
Texture measures look for visual patterns in images and how they are spatially defined. Textures are represented by texels which are then placed into a number of sets, depending on how many textures are detected in the image. These sets not only define the texture, but also where in the image the texture is located.

Texture is a difficult concept to represent. The identification of specific textures in an image is achieved primarily by modeling texture as a two-dimensional gray level variation. The relative brightness of pairs of pixels is computed such that degree of contrast, regularity, coarseness and directionality may be estimated. The problem is in identifying patterns of co-pixel variation and associating them with particular classes of textures such as &quot;silky&quot;, or &quot;rough&quot;.

Other methods of classifying textures include:
* Co-occurrence matrix
* Laws texture energy
* Wavelet transform
* Orthogonal transforms (discrete Chebyshev moments)

===Shape===
Shape does not refer to the shape of an image but to the shape of a particular region that is being sought out. Shapes will often be determined first applying segmentation or edge detection to an image. Other methods use shape filters to identify given shapes of an image. Shape descriptors may also need to be invariant to translation, rotation, and scale.

Some shape descriptors include:
* Fourier transform
* Moment invariant

== Vulnerabilities, attacks and defenses ==

Like other tasks in computer vision such as recognition and detection, recent neural network based retrieval algorithms are susceptible to adversarial attacks, both as candidate and the query attacks. It is shown that retrieved ranking could be dramatically altered with only small perturbations imperceptible to human beings. In addition, model-agnostic transferable adversarial examples are also possible, which enables black-box adversarial attacks on deep ranking systems without requiring access to their underlying implementations.

Conversely, the resistance to such attacks can be improved via adversarial defenses such as the Madry defense.

==Image retrieval evaluation==
Measures of image retrieval can be defined in terms of precision and recall. However, there are other methods being considered.

==Image retrieval in CBIR system simultaneously by different techniques==
An image is retrieved in CBIR system by adopting several techniques simultaneously such as Integrating Pixel Cluster Indexing, histogram intersection and discrete wavelet transform methods.

<text>Space law is the body of law governing space-related activities, encompassing both international and domestic agreements, rules, and principles. Parameters of space law include space exploration, liability for damage, weapons use, rescue efforts, environmental preservation, information sharing, new technologies, and ethics. Other fields of law, such as administrative law, intellectual property law, arms control law, insurance law, environmental law, criminal law, and commercial law, are also integrated within space law.

The origins of space law date back to 1919, with international law recognizing each country&#x27;s sovereignty over the airspace directly above their territory, later reinforced at the Chicago Convention in 1944. The onset of domestic space programs during the Cold War propelled the official creation of international space policy (i.e., the International Geophysical Year) initiated by the International Council of Scientific Unions. The Soviet Union&#x27;s 1957 launch of the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, directly spurred the United States Congress to pass the Space Act, thus creating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Because space exploration required crossing transnational boundaries, it was during this era where space law became a field independent from traditional aerospace law.

Since the Cold War, the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (the &quot;Outer Space Treaty&quot;) and the International Telecommunication Union have served as the constitutional legal framework and set of principles and procedures constituting space law. Further, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), along with its Legal and Scientific and Technical Subcommittees, are responsible for debating issues of international space law and policy. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) serves as the secretariat of the committee and promotes Access to Space for All through a wide range of conferences and capacity-building programs. Challenges that space law will continue to face in the future are fourfold—spanning across dimensions of domestic compliance, international cooperation, ethics, and the advent of scientific innovations. Furthermore, specific guidelines on the definition of airspace have yet to be universally determined.

== Early developments ==
One of the earliest works on space law was Czech jurist Vladimír Mandl&#x27;s (Space Law: A Problem of Space Travel), written in German and published in 1932.

At Caltech in 1942 Theodore von Kármán and other rocket scientists banded together to form Aerojet rocket company with the help of lawyer Andrew G. Haley. To toast the new corporation, Kármán said, &quot;Now, Andy, we will make the rockets—you must make the corporation and obtain the money. Later on, you will have to see that we behave well in outer space. ... After all, we are the scientists but you are the lawyer, and you must tell us how to behave ourselves according to law and to safeguard our innocence.&quot; Indeed, twenty years later, Haley published the fundamental textbook, &quot;Space Law and Government&quot;.

Beginning in 1957 with the Space Race, nations began discussing systems to ensure the peaceful use of outer space. Bilateral discussions between the United States and the USSR in 1958 resulted in the presentation of issues to the UN for debate. In 1959, the UN created the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). COPUOS in turn created two subcommittees, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and the Legal Subcommittee. The COPUOS Legal Subcommittee has been a primary forum for discussion and negotiation of international agreements relating to outer space.

In 1960, the International Astronautical Congress met in Stockholm and heard several submissions including a survey of legal opinion on extraterrestrial jurisdiction by Andrew G. Haley.

Starting in 1961, the General Assembly Resolution 1721 (XVI) and later 1802 (XVII), both titled &quot;International Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space&quot;, and Resolution 1962 (XVIII), or a &quot;Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space&quot; were passed unanimously. These basic principles formed the foundation of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.

== International treaties ==
Six international treaties have been negotiated to govern state behaviour in space:

The Rescue Agreement, the Liability Convention and the Registration Convention all elaborate on provisions of the Outer Space Treaty. Many consider the Moon Treaty to be a failed treaty due to its limited acceptance. Others however have suggested to compliment the Moon Treaty, to accommodate raised issues with it, while employing its qualities.

=== 1998 ISS agreement ===
In addition to the international treaties that have been negotiated at the United Nations, the nations participating in the International Space Station have entered into the 1998 Agreement among the governments of Canada, Member States of the European Space Agency, Japan, Russian Federation, and the United States concerning cooperation on the Civil International Space Station. This agreement provides, among other things, that NASA is the lead agency in coordinating the member states&#x27; contributions to and activities on the space station, and that each nation has jurisdiction over its own module(s). The agreement also provides for protection of intellectual property and procedures for criminal prosecution. This agreement may very well serve as a model for future agreements regarding international cooperation in facilities on the Moon and Mars, where the first off-world colonies and scientific/industrial bases are likely to be established.

== International principles and declarations ==

The five treaties and agreements of international space law cover &quot;non-appropriation of outer space by any one country, arms control, the freedom of exploration, liability for damage caused by space objects, the safety and rescue of spacecraft and astronauts, the prevention of harmful interference with space activities and the environment, the notification and registration of space activities, scientific investigation and the exploitation of natural resources in outer space and the settlement of disputes&quot;.

The United Nations General Assembly adopted five declarations and legal principles which encourage exercising international laws, as well as unified communication between countries. The five declarations and principles are:

:*The Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Uses of Outer Space (1963)
:All space exploration will be done with good intentions and is equally open to all States that comply with international law. No one nation may claim ownership of outer space or any celestial body. Activities carried out in space must abide by the international law and the nations undergoing these said activities must accept responsibility for the governmental or non-governmental agency involved. Objects launched into space are subject to their nation of belonging, including people. Objects, parts, and components discovered outside the jurisdiction of a nation will be returned upon identification. If a nation launches an object into space, they are responsible for any damages that occur internationally.

:*Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (1979)
:The agreement, also called Moon Treaty exists to promote the exploration of outer space, but to keep the Moon and other celestial bodies in pristine conditions for the common heritage of mankind, meaning that no nation may claim sovereignty over any part of space. All countries should have equal rights to conduct research on the Moon or other celestial bodies. Weapons of mass destruction of any kind including nuclear and bases built for military purposes are specifically banned by the treaty. The United Nations resolution also states that all State Parties may conduct their enterprises below the surface of the Moon or any celestial body so long as efforts are made to protect it from contamination. All activities in space are required to be attached to a nation and any damages to other nations equipment or facilities caused by another party must be repaid in full to that nation. Any discovery of a dangerous hazard such as an area that is radioactive must notify the United Nations Secretary General and the greater international scientific community immediately.
:All missions in space lasting longer than 60 days must notify the UN Secretary General and the greater scientific community every 30 days of progress. Any samples that are collected from space must be made available at earliest convenience to the scientific community. The agreement does not include meteorites that fall to Earth by natural means. Currently not a single nation that conducts its own missions in space has ratified the agreement. This likely signifies that the &#x27;Moon Treaty is likely a failed treaty because none of the nations that actually go into space signed or ratified the agreement. That said the need for a lunar activities regulating agreement has been pointed out and proposed to be combined with a Moon Treaty clarifying &quot;Implementation Agreement&quot;.
:*The Principles Governing the Use by States of Artificial Earth Satellites for International Direct Television Broadcasting (1982)
:Activities of this nature must be transpired in accordance with the sovereign rights of States. Said activities should &quot;promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields, assist in educational, social and economic development, particularly in the developing countries, enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States&quot;. All States have equal rights to pursue these activities and must maintain responsibility for anything carried out under their boundaries of authority. State&#x27;s planning activities need to contact the Secretary-General of the United Nations with details of the undergoing activities.

:*The Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from Outer Space (1986)
:Fifteen principles are stated under this category. The basic understanding comes from these descriptions given by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs:
:(a) The term &quot;remote sensing&quot; means the sensing of the Earth&#x27;s surface from space by making use of the properties of electromagnetic waves emitted, reflected or: diffracted by the sensed objects, for the purpose of improving natural resources management, land use and the protection of the environment;
:(b) The term &quot;primary data&quot; means those raw data that are acquired by remote sensors borne by a space object and that are transmitted or delivered to the ground: from space by telemetry in the form of electromagnetic signals, by photographic film, magnetic tape or any other means;
:(c) The term &quot;processed data&quot; means the products resulting from the processing of the primary data, needed to make such data usable;
:(d) The term &quot;analyzed information&quot; means the information resulting from the interpretation of processed data, inputs of data and knowledge from other sources;
:(e) The term &quot;remote sensing activities&quot; means the operation of remote sensing space systems, primary data collection and storage stations, and activities in :processing, interpreting and disseminating the processed data.

:*The Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space (1992)
:&quot;States launching space objects with nuclear power sources on board shall endeavour to protect individuals, populations and the biosphere against radiological hazards. The design and use of space objects with nuclear power sources on board shall ensure, with a high degree of confidence, that the hazards, in foreseeable operational or accidental circumstances, are kept below acceptable levels. ...&quot;

:*The Declaration on International Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the Interest of All States, Taking into Particular Account the Needs of Developing Countries (1996)
:&quot;States are free to determine all aspects of their participation in international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis. All States, particularly those with relevant space capabilities and with programmes for the exploration and use of outer space, should contribute to promoting and fostering international cooperation on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis. In this context, particular attention should be given to the benefit for and the interests of developing countries and countries with incipient space programmes stemming from such international cooperation conducted with countries with more advanced space capabilities. International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned, including, inter alia, governmental and non-governmental; commercial and non-commercial; global, multilateral, regional or bilateral; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development.&quot;

=== Province of all mankind ===
The Outer Space Treaty broadly established the concept of space being the &quot;province of all mankind&quot;, and has been discussed in comparison to the later by the Moon Treaty invoked concept of &quot;common heritage of humanity&quot;, while overlapping concepts the latter highlights the proclaimed material nature of celestial bodies and the former the proclaimed access to the use of space.

== Consensus ==

The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical and Legal Subcommittees operate on the basis of consensus, &quot;i.e.,&quot; all delegations from member States must agree on any matter, be it treaty language before it can be included in the final version of a treaty or new items on Committee/Subcommittee&#x27;s agendas. One reason that the U.N. space treaties lack definitions and are unclear in other respects, is that it is easier to achieve consensus when language and terms are vague. In recent years, the Legal Subcommittee has been unable to achieve consensus on discussion of a new comprehensive space agreement (the idea of which, though, was proposed just by a few member States). It is also unlikely that the Subcommittee will be able to agree to amend the Outer Space Treaty in the foreseeable future. Many space faring nations seem to believe that discussing a new space agreement or amendment of the Outer Space Treaty would be futile and time-consuming, because entrenched differences regarding resource appropriation, property rights and other issues relating to commercial activity make consensus unlikely.

==National law==
Space law also encompasses national laws, and many countries have passed national space legislation in recent years. The Outer Space Treaty gives responsibility for regulating space activities, including both government and private sector, to the individual countries where the activity is taking place. If a national of, or an organization incorporated in one country launches a spacecraft in a different country, interpretations differ as to whether the home country or the launching country has jurisdiction.

The Outer Space Treaty also incorporates the UN Charter by reference, and requires parties to ensure that activities are conducted in accordance with other forms of international law such as customary international law (the custom and practice of states).

The advent of commercial activities like space mining, space tourism, private exploration, and the development of many commercial spaceports, is leading many countries to consider how to regulate private space activities. The challenge is to regulate these activities in a manner that does not hinder or preclude investment, while still ensuring that commercial activities comply with international law. Developing nations are concerned that the spacefaring nations will monopolize space resources. Royalties paid to developing countries is one reason the United States has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and why some oppose applying the same principles to outer space.

Several nations have enacted or recently updated their national space law, for example, Luxembourg in 2017, 
the United States in 2015, 
and Japan in 2008.
Due to the expansion of the domain of space research and allied activities in India, the Draft Space Activities Bill was introduced in 2017.

==Issues==
=== Defining &quot;space&quot; ===

Many questions arise from the difficulty of defining the term &quot;space&quot;. Scholars not only debate its geographical definition (i.e., upper and lower limits), but also whether or not it also encompasses various objects within it (i.e., celestial objects, human beings, man-made devices). Lower limits are generally estimated to be about 50 kilometers. More difficulties arise trying to define the upper bounds of &quot;space&quot;, as it would require more inquiry into the nature of the universe and the role of Earth as a planet.

=== Geostationary orbit allocation ===
==== Allocative limitations ====
Objects in geostationary orbits remain stationary over a point on the Earth due to gravity. There are numerous advantages in being able to use these orbits, mostly due to the unique ability to send radio frequencies to and from satellites to collect data and send signals to various locations. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has approved seven nonmilitary uses for these orbits: communications, meteorology, Earth&#x27;s resources and environment, navigation and aircraft control, testing of new systems, astronomy, and data relay. The requirement to space these satellites apart means that there is a limited number of orbital &quot;slots&quot; available, thus only a limited number of satellites can be placed in geostationary orbit. This has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots (countries at the same longitude but differing latitudes). These disputes are addressed through the ITU allocation mechanism.

Countries located at the Earth&#x27;s equator have also asserted their legal claim to control the use of space above their territory, notably in 1976, when many countries located at the Earth&#x27;s equator created the Bogota Declaration, in which they asserted their legal claim to control the use of space above their territory, but failed to challenge the Outer Space Treaty in this regard.

==== Political controversy ====
Future developments using geostationary orbits may include an expansion of services in telecommunication, broadcasting, and meteorology. As a result, uses for geostationary orbits may stir political controversy. For example, broadcasting and telecommunication services of satellites orbiting above Earth from certain nations may accidentally &quot;spill over&quot; into other nations&#x27; territory. This may prompt conflict with nations that wish to restrict access to information and communication. Current and future political and legal concerns allocation may pose may be addressed by international legislatures, such as the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and the International Telecommunication Union.

=== Environmental protection ===
More recent discussions focus on the need for the international community to draft and institute a code of space ethics to prevent the destruction of the space environment. Furthermore, the advancement of life in space pertain to questions related to the ethics of biocentrism and anthropocentrism, or in other words, determining how much value we place in all living things versus human beings specifically. Currently, researchers in the bioengineering field are working towards contamination control measures integrated into spacecraft to protect both space and earth&#x27;s biosphere.

==== Environmental space governance====
Beyond space debris, rocket launches and the re-entry of reusable components and space debris also cause air pollution. A study estimated their impacts on climate change and the ozone layer in 2019 and from a theoretical future space industry extrapolated from the &quot;billionaire space race&quot;. It concludes that substantial effects from routine space tourism should &quot;motivate regulation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1029/2021EF002612&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space Heritage protection ===

Space Heritage can be understood to mean traces of human existence, together with their archaeological and natural contexts that occur in outer space, including on the Moon and other celestial bodies. Conceptually, this definition can be interpreted to include any human-made material in space and as humanity continues to increase the pace of exploratory and commercial missions to the Moon and beyond. Thus, protocols must be established to manage Space Heritage for two very different reasons: first so that relevant cultural heritage, which is so important to build kinship amongst humans, is preserved; and second to assure that the concept of heritage is not abused by national space actors.

Human heritage in outer space includes Tranquility Base (Apollo 11&#x27;s lunar landing site) and the robotic and crewed sites that preceded and followed Apollo 11. This also comprises all the Luna programme vehicles, including the Luna 2 (first object) and Luna 9 (first soft-landing) missions, the Surveyor program and the Yutu rovers.

Human heritage in outer space also includes satellites like Vanguard 1 and Asterix-1 which, though nonoperational, remain in orbit.

Currently, these sites are not recognized as cultural heritage or protected in any way under international law. They are addressed in Section 9 of the Artemis Accords which includes an agreement to preserve outer space heritage, which they consider to comprise historically significant human or robotic landing sites, artifacts, spacecraft, and other evidence of activity, and to contribute to multinational efforts to develop practices and rules to do so.

===Sovereignty===
Current space law has framed space as a common good by calling it the &quot;province of all mankind&quot;, and no state has claimed any part of space as their territory, despite practicing the placing of flags. That said it has been argued, that sovereignty is an issue through jurisdiction, which applies to installed facilities and the present actors in space.

=== Ethics ===

In space law, ethics extend to topics regarding space exploration, space tourism, space ownership, the militarization of space, environmental protection, and distinguishing the boundaries of space itself. In March 2023, For All Moonkind announced the formation of the Institute on Space Law and Ethics, a &quot;new nonprofit organization will go beyond advocating for protecting off-world heritage sites and contemplate the ethics around some activities in space that are not fully covered in existing international law.&quot;

=== Interplanetary Human Rights ===
International space law developed after the Second World War when international human rights were established, but both developed independently, and have therefore been identified to be in need to be thought together and expanded, especially with advancing space flight and interest in space settlement.

It has been suggested that human rights need to be accompanied in space by a set of fundamental rights. Approached from Crip Legal Theory, the following three such novel fundamental rights have been suggested by the &quot;Jus Ad Astra&quot; project: the right to water, the right to a breathable atmosphere and the right to a habitable environment.

For such rights state and private accountability has become, particular in light of increased private space activity, a growing issue.

=== Human representation, participation and colonialism===

The issue of human representation and participation in space has been a focus of international space law since the beginning of space exploration.

In the early stages of international space law, outer space was framed as &quot;res communis&quot;, explicitly not as &quot;terra nullius&quot;, in the &quot;Magna Carta of Space&quot; presented by William A. Hyman in 1966. This concept has since influenced the work of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and the exploration and use of outer space has been declared as the &quot;province of all mankind&quot;.

Critics though argue that the sharing of space for all humanity is still lacking, with imperialist views prevailing. Moreover, there are concerns that the current politico-legal regimes and their philosophical underpinnings may favor the imperialist development of space. Consequently, it has been argued that space law is in the need for being reevaluated to ensure the consideration of the relevance and contributions of countries without significant spaceflight, particularly as an answer to colonial histories and colonialism.

Space colonization has been criticized as a continuation of imperialism and colonialism, leading to postcolonial critiques of colonial decision-making and reasons for labor and land exploitation. There is a growing recognition of the need for inclusive and democratic participation in any space exploration, infrastructure, or habitation. Despite the Outer Space Treaty guaranteeing access to space, space law has faced criticism for not securing international and social inclusiveness, particularly concerning private spaceflight. The often heard declaration that humanity&#x27;s destiny lies in colonizing the solar system, particularly in the &quot;billionaire space race&quot;, leaving many earthbound problems behind has been criticized as &quot;techno-utopian [...] hubris&quot;, suggesting &quot;a multilateral agreement to strictly govern and limit expansion into space&quot;.

=== Commercial use ===

Early discussions regarding space ethics revolved around whether or not the space frontier should be available for use, gaining prominence at the time of the Soviet Union and the United States&#x27; Space Race. In 1967, the &quot;Outer Space Treaty&quot; dictated that all nations in compliance with international regulation are permitted to exploit space. As a result, the commercial use of space is open to exploitation by public and private entities, especially in relation to mining and space tourism. This principle has been the subject of controversy, particularly by those in favor of environmental protection, sustainability, and conservation.

===Exploitation===
While this field of the law is still in its infancy, it is in an era of rapid change and development. Arguably, the resources of space are infinite. If commercial space transportation becomes widely available, with substantially lower launch costs, then all countries will be able to directly reap the benefits of space resources. In that situation, it seems likely that consensus will be much easier to achieve with respect to commercial development and human settlement of outer space. High costs are not the only factor preventing the economic exploitation of space: it is argued that space should be considered as a pristine environment worthy of protection and conservation, and that the legal regime for space should further protect it from being used as a resource for Earth&#x27;s needs. Debate is also focused on whether space should continue to be legally defined as part of the &quot;Common heritage of mankind&quot;, and therefore unavailable for national claims, or whether its legal definition should be changed to allow private property in space.

As of 2013, NASA&#x27;s plans to capture an asteroid by 2021 has raised questions about how space law would be applied in practice.

In 2016, the nation of Luxembourg has set out a formal legal framework which ensures that private companies engaged in mining resources in space have rights to those resources.

===Anthropocentrisms===
Spreading humanity&#x27;s influence far beyond the Earth raises questions about potential other intelligences that have spread through reachable space. Astroethics can consider extraterrestrial having ethics, which may often reflect in laws and understand humanity and its multitude of ethics (which may often reflect in laws and policies) as a part of the universe in a more holistic, possibly even &quot;cosmic&quot;, view.

===Spacefaring machines===

Progress in robotics and artificial intelligence is eroding the need for humans in space with human endeavours often being less cost-effective than robotic missions, with ethical implications for society. Laws as well as adaption-requirements for humans differ in space, which could be a legitimation for crewed – rather than robotic – space-missions.

===Contact regime===
There have been some proposals as with the &quot;Magna Carta of Space&quot; presented by William A. Hyman in 1966 or through the concept of metalaw to introduce legal basics in case of detection of or contact with indigenous extraterrestrial intelligence. As of 2018, there are basically no principles for dealing with a successful confirmed SETI detection.

===Rights of nature===
In 2021, the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of the Moon&quot; was created by a group of &quot;lawyers, space archaeologists and concerned citizens&quot;, drawing on precedents in the Rights of Nature movement and the concept of legal personality for non-human entities in space.

== Dispute resolution ==
Space Law also attempts to provide a framework for dispute resolution for matters which arise in space. The following mechanisms are available to the different types of affected parties.

State Actors

* State actors can choose to bring a case before the International Court of Justice for breaches under the Liability Convention or the Outer Space Treaty. Strong arguments can also be made for breaches of customary international law.
* Alternatively, state actors can also attempt to resolve disputes between themselves and reach a negotiated settlement. This was the case in the Kosmos 954 incident between Canada and the USSR.

Non-State Actors

Non-state actors are first directed to approach an appropriate state party where one is involved as per the Liability Convention. Where the dispute is private and commercial in nature however, many private companies opt for arbitration. So far, arbitration has primarily been conducted under the Permanent Court of Arbitration under the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules but the existence of the more specialised &quot;Optional Rules for Arbitration of Disputes Relating to Outer Space Activities&quot; might see a shift in procedural law chosen by the parties in the future. Examples of disputes resolved by arbitration include the cases of &quot;CC/Devas (Mauritius) Ltd., Devas Employees Mauritius Private Ltd., &amp; Telcom Devas Mauritius Ltd. v. Republic of India&quot;, PCA Case No. 2013-09 and &quot;Deutsche Telekom AG v. The Republic of India&quot;, PCA Case No. 2014-10.

Beside arbitration there is also the possibility of a &quot;Claims Commission&quot; as outlined in the Liability Convention. Altogether arbitration has been discussed as an emerging or active field.

== Future institutional developments ==
=== Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Space Threats ===
With no progress in the negotiation of the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space in 2020, the UN resolution &quot;Reducing Space Threats Through Norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible Behaviours&quot; was signed. Subsequently, the &quot;Open Ended Working Group on Reducing Space Threats Through Norms, Rules and Principles of Responsible Behaviours&quot; was established and found some traction, particularly since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===Future coordination and cooperation===
International coordination and cooperation are facilitated by the growing inter-agency International Space Exploration Coordination Group and planned for the Lunar Gateway space station, emulating the cooperation for the ISS.

=== Legal Profession ===

There is a growing emphasis on space law in academia. Since 1951, the McGill Faculty of Law in Montreal, Canada has hosted the Institute of Air and Space Law, and offers an LL.M. in Air and Space law. The University of Mississippi School of Law publishes the world&#x27;s only law journal devoted to space law, the &quot;Journal of Space Law&quot;. The University of Mississippi School of Law is also the only ABA-accredited law school in the world to offer an LL.M. in Air and Space Law, a Graduate Certificate and a JD Concentration in Air and Space Law. Michelle Hanlon serves as the executive director of the Center for Air and Space Law at the university. In 2008, the University of Nebraska College of Law launched its space, cyber, and telecommunications law program, offering courses and specializations to JD students and an LL.M. in Space, Cyber, and Telecommunications. Over the last decade, other universities have begun to offer specialized courses and programs in the US, UK, France, the Netherlands, and Australia.

In September 2012, the Space Law Society (SLS) at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law was established. A legal resources team united in Maryland, a &quot;Space Science State&quot;, with Jorge Rodriguez, Lee Sampson, Patrick Gardiner, Lyra Correa and Juliana Neelbauer as SLS founding members. In 2014, students at American University Washington College of Law founded the school&#x27;s Space Law Society, with the help of Pamela L. Meredith, space lawyer and adjunct professor of Satellite Communications and Space Law.

Efforts to codify the legal regime are mostly represented in the Manual on International Law Applicable to Military Uses of Outer Space (MILAMOS) and the Woomera Manual. The Woomera Manual is a collaborative effort between the University of Adelaide, UNSW Canberra, the University of Exeter, and the University of Nebraska College of Law. Like the San Remo and Tallinn Manuals, the goal is to clarify the law as it relates to outer space.

In 2018, two space lawyers - Christopher Hearsey and Nathan Johnson - founded the Space Court Foundation, a 501(c)(3) educational nonprofit corporation that promotes and supports space law and policy education and the rule of law. The Space Court Foundation produces educational materials and scholarship through the administration of two major projects: Stellar Decisis and the Space Court Law Library. The foundation engages in partnerships and collaborations that help grow greater awareness of space law and how disputes in space may be resolved as humans venture farther from Earth in the not too distant future.
=== International efforts to inform progressive development of International Space Law ===
The McGill Institute of Air and Space Law is leading multiple international collaborative projects to contribute towards clarifying international space law and promote rules-based global order. One such project announced in 2017, being led by Prof. Ram S. Jakhu, is the McGill Manual on International Law Applicable to Military Uses of Outer Space (MILAMOS Project) which aims to clarify existing rules of international law as they apply to military uses of outer space. The MILAMOS Project aims to contribute to &quot;a future where all space activities are conducted in accordance with the international rules-based global order, without disrupting, and preferably contributing to, the sustainable use of outer space for the benefit of present and future generations of all humanity.&quot; Another international collaborative project announced in 2020, being led by Prof. Ram S. Jakhu, Bayar Goswami and Kuan-Wei (David) Chen, is the McGill Encyclopedia of International Space Law (at SpaceLawPedia.com) which aims to &quot;fulfill the need for an objectively curated online resource on key subject-matters of international space law. With the input of a team of global practitioners and academics in the field of international space law and general international law, the SpaceLawPedia aims to be the definitive source of peer-reviewed reference material for anyone practising, conducting research on or teaching international space law.&quot;

For a deeper awareness and understanding of issues arising from the ongoing scramble for the Moon, the Open Lunar Foundation has been working with a broad range of professionals to find in an open and responsible way approaches which find and address issues. This work has produced the &quot;Lunar Policy Handbook&quot; under its &quot;Moon Dialogs&quot; program, the lunar activity registry proposal &quot;Bright Moon&quot;, and a program for approaches for ressource collection called &quot;Breaking Ground&quot;.

=== Global space agency ===
International context can be traced all the way back to the International Geophysical Year in the course of which the first orbital flight was conducted, and early work on establishing international cooperation in space. Even a joint US-USSR space program was actively for a short time negotiated. Today&#x27;s international space laws are the most remaining remnants of these early advances in space cooperation.

The end of the Cold War was presented as an opportunity, allowing today&#x27;s International Space Station and fueling academic suggestions like an &quot;interspace&quot; design for the establishment of an international space agency. With increased space environmental awareness a &quot;Framework Convention on the Protection of the Space Environment&quot; and yet again an &quot;International Space Agency&quot; has been academically suggested, while having seen practically no advances. Despite the absence of an international space agency, international cooperation in space is being widely pursued, with the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) and International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) being the most high-level coordination groups, the latter produces the &quot;Global Exploration Roadmap&quot;.

<text>St Aldhelm&#x27;s Academy is a co-educational secondary school serving the Rossmore, Parkstone, Newtown, Wallisdown and Alderney areas of Poole, Dorset, England.

==School history==
The school opened in October 1938 as Kemp-Welch Senior Council School and taught both boys and girls —the boys were housed in the west side of the building, while the girls were housed in the east. This was typical for a school of its time. There was a &#x27;quad&#x27; in the middle of the school which divided the two schools.

The school became a secondary modern after the Second World War and expanded rapidly in 1963 to house 600 students in both schools. An East Block was built onto the girls&#x27; school, housing additional classrooms, art rooms and a music room. The West Block was built across the boys&#x27; playground and housed classrooms, science labs and the boys&#x27; music room. Prior to this, new workshops and kitchens had been built. The boys&#x27; gym was built onto the rear of the boys&#x27; half of the main block (now the technology block) and the girls&#x27; gym was built on the school field and is now part of the leisure centre.

In 1974 the two schools merged to form one large school and the age was changed from 11–16 to 12–16. Not a great deal changed at the school over the next 15 years and the school fell into a state of disrepair. Pupil numbers dropped in the 1980s and 1990s leaving the school with empty classrooms. The leisure centre first opened onto the former girls&#x27; gym in 1992 and the second phase opened in 1998. In 1994 the school opened its sixth form. Despite this, the school was being seen as a &#x27;rough school&#x27; with many parents in the local area sending their children to other schools. In 1999 only half of the children from Branksome Heath Middle School (largest in catchment) went to Kemp-Welch with the remainder going to either Poole or Parkstone Grammar School, Poole High or St Edwards Schools .

In 2000 the school was put into &#x27;special measures&#x27; by Ofsted and the school aimed to improve itself in time for its next Ofsted visit or face closure. The school changed its name to Rossmore Community College and underwent a major building program to reinvent itself.

In September 2003 the school became a sports college, one of two in Poole. On 1 September 2010, the school opened as St. Aldhelms Academy under the new Academies Act 2010. The school also came under the jurisdiction of the Church of England.

In 2013, the school&#x27;s new £9.8 million new buildings opened.

In recent years, the school has faced a number of issues; it became national news in 2012 when it was reported that the school had achieved the worst GCSE results in England. In 2014, the school became national news again when it lost £1,000,000 in an online banking scam; this was the second time that then-headteacher Cheryl Heron has been victim of scamming, as her previous school in Portsmouth were conned in a charity golf event. Another issue under Cheryl Heron&#x27;s time as headteacher, according to a 2015 article in The Independent, was building work that had occurred in the school, which involved &quot;open-plan classrooms&quot; that housed up to five different classes at a time. This was reported as one of Heron&#x27;s several failed ideas; in previous schools, she had tried implementing &quot;ability over age&quot; classes, wherein students were streamed based on ability regardless of age, and devised a plan for students with poor attendance to have more flexible school hours. The school achieved mainstream media recognition again in 2015, when it was forced to close after a significant number of staff members called in sick and cover staff could not be found. The school&#x27;s closure coincided with a surprise inspection by OFSTED, who later described the school as &quot;dysfunctional and unsafe&quot;.

As of 1 June 2015, the school&#x27;s new sponsor, Ambitions Academdies Trust, took over the running and management of the school.

==Leisure centre==
Rossmore Leisure Centre is located next to the school. This facility is used for Physical Education lessons, and is also open to the public. It comprises a sports hall, gym, fitness suite and a swimming pool, and is adjoined by a sports field and tennis courts.

The original Leisure Centre was built in 1992 onto the sports block and included the gym, sports hall, fitness studio and a new canteen for the school (used for parties for the public). In 1998 the centre was extended further with a new swimming pool (the Herbert Ballam pool), new fitness studio (the old studio became a bar) and a gymnastics hall which has trained Olympic contestants. The centre was original Kemp-Welch Leisure Centre, but became Rossmore Leisure Centre in January 2003.

<text>The Chiesa di San Polo is a Catholic church in Venice, dedicated to the Apostle Paul. It gives its name to the San Polo sestiere of the city.

== Exterior ==
The current Gothic church dates from the 15th century, but a church has stood on the site since the 9th century and the south doorway, possibly by Bartolomeo Bon, survives from this church. The campanile, standing detached from the church, was built in 1362.

== Interior ==
The interior has a ship&#x27;s keel roof and was restored in 1804 by Davide Rossi. On the left wall near the entrance is a &quot;Last Supper&quot; by Jacopo Tintoretto, while the first altarpiece on the left, is attributed to his studio. Other walls have canvases by Paolo Piazza (&quot;St Silvester baptizes Emperor Constantine&quot; and &quot;St Paul Preaching&quot;; by Jacopo Guarana (&quot;Sacred Heart&quot;).

The altar of the absidal chapel on the left has a &quot;Marriage of the Virgin&quot; by Paolo Veronese. The presbytery has canvases by Palma il Giovane including &quot;St Peter and the Keys&quot;, the &quot;St Paul at Tarsus&quot;, and a &quot;Temptation of St Anthony Abbot&quot;). Next to the altar are two bronze statues by Alessandro Vittoria:&quot;St Paul&quot; and &quot;St Anthony Abbot&quot;.

Among the ceiling paintings are a &quot;Glory of Angels&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot; by Giandomenico Tiepolo. His father, Giambattista is thought to be the author of &quot;Virgin appears to St John Nepomuk&quot;, commissioned by the King of Poland, August III.

== Oratory of the Crucifix ==

<doc id="743982" wikidata="Q213466" url="?curid=743982" title="147 Protogeneia">
<text>147 Protogenia is a large main belt asteroid that was discovered by Hungarian astronomer Lipót Schulhof on July 10, 1875, from the Vienna Observatory; it was his only asteroid discovery. Its name is Greek for &quot;first born&quot; and was chosen by Karl L. Littrow in allusion to the fact that this was the first asteroid discovered by an astronomer who was already known for work in other fields of astronomy.

This object has a low orbital eccentricity and inclination. With an orbital period roughly double that of the planet Jupiter, it has been identified as a member of the Hecuba group of asteroids that share a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with the giant planet. Based upon its spectrum, it has a Tholen classification as a C-type asteroid, which indicates that it has a dark surface and probably a primitive composition of carbonaceous material.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Altimira Observatory in 2004 gave a light curve with a period of 7.8528 ± 0.0008 hours and a brightness variation of 0.28 in magnitude. A photometric study was reported in 2006 from the Yunnan Observatory in China, finding a matching period of 7.852 hours and a brightness variation of 0.25 magnitude. They estimate the ratio of the lengths for the asteroid&#x27;s major and minor axes is at least 1.26:1.

There is one reported stellar occultation by Protogeneia, on May 28, 2002, from Texas.

<text>Perdita is an inner satellite of Uranus. Perdita&#x27;s discovery was very complicated, as the first photographs of Perdita were taken by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft in 1986, but it was not recognized from the photographs for more than a decade. In 1999, the moon was noticed by Erich Karkoschka and reported. But because no further pictures could be taken to confirm its existence, it was officially demoted in 2001. However, in 2003, pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope managed to pick up an object where Perdita was supposed to be, finally confirming its existence.

Following its discovery in 1999, it was given the temporary designation of S/1986 U 10. It was named Perdita (Latin for &#x27;lost&#x27;) after the daughter of Leontes and Hermione in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The moon is also designated Uranus XXV.

The moon orbits between Belinda and Puck. The above-mentioned Hubble measurements prove that Perdita does not follow a direct Keplerian motion around Uranus. Instead, it is clearly caught in a 43:44 orbital resonance with the nearby moon Belinda, and from this resonance it has been determined that Belinda&#x27;s mass is 26 times that of Perdita. It is also close to an 8:7 resonance with Rosalind.

Perdita belongs to the Portia group of satellites, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Juliet, Cupid, Rosalind, and Belinda. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Little is known about Perdita apart from its orbit, radius of 13.3 km, and geometric albedo of 0.08.

<doc id="743986" wikidata="Q2962946" url="?curid=743986" title="American Horse of the Year">
<text>The American Award for Horse of the Year, or simply Horse of the Year, one of the Eclipse Awards, is the highest honor given in American thoroughbred horse racing. Because Thoroughbred horse racing in the United States has no governing body to sanction the various awards, &quot;Horse of the Year&quot; is not an official national award.

The Champion award is a designation given to a horse, irrespective of age, whose performance during the racing year was deemed the most outstanding. The list below is a Champion&#x27;s history compilation beginning with the year 1887 published by the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association&#x27;s &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; magazine (founded 1961), described by ESPN as &quot;the Thoroughbred industry&#x27;s most-respected trade publication&quot;.

In 1936 a Horse of the Year award was created by a poll of the staff of &quot;The New York Morning Telegraph&quot; and its sister newspaper, the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; (DRF), a tabloid founded in 1894 that was focused on statistical information for bettors. At the same time a rival poll was organised by the Baltimore-based &quot;Turf and Sport Digest&quot; magazine. Formed in 1942 as an advocacy group, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations (TRA) inaugurated a competing award in 1950, selecting its winners from votes by racing secretaries from member tracks across the United States. The three systems resulted in different opinions as to &quot;Horse of the Year&quot; Champions in 1949, 1952, 1957, 1965, and 1970. In 1971, the DRF and TRA made an agreement with the National Turf Writers Association to merge into one set of awards, called the Eclipse Awards.

==Historical notes on winners==
In a rare occurrence, two two-year-olds topped the balloting for 1972 American Horse of the Year honors with Secretariat edging out the filly, La Prevoyante. Secretariat received the votes of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations of North America and the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot;, while La Prevoyante was chosen by the National Turf Writers Association.

Kelso, who placed 4th in &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, won &quot;Horse of the Year&quot; honors five consecutive years. Omaha is the only winner of the U.S. Triple Crown that was not voted &quot;Horse of the Year&quot; honors.

==Records==
Most wins:
* 5 – Kelso (1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964)

Most wins by a trainer:
* 8 – James G. Rowe Sr. (1896, 1900, 1901, 1905, 1907, 1908, 1913, 1915)

Most wins by an owner:
* 6 – Calumet Farm (1941, 1942, 1944, 1947, 1948, 1949)

==Honorees==

===Eclipse Awards===

The 2003 Eclipse Awards marked a significant change in the way that honors were decided.

Under this format, voting is conducted by selected members of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot;, and the National Turf Writers and Broadcasters (formerly National Turf Writers Association). The winner of the Eclipse Award for American Horse of the Year is the horse who has received the most first-place votes.

The 2002 Eclipse Awards were the last conducted under a voting bloc system, in which each of the three voting groups could only cast a single collective vote based on the polling of that group&#x27;s members. In the event of an overall split vote, the award would go to the horse who had received the most points - each group&#x27;s vote awarded ten points for first place, five points for second place, and one point for third place. In the event that there was a tie on points, the award would go to the horse who had received the most individual first-place votes.

<text>145 Adeona is a large asteroid from the intermediate asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. Its surface is very dark, and, based upon its classification as a C-type asteroid, is probably composed of primitive carbonaceous material. The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration. The Adeona family of asteroids is named after it.

It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on June 3, 1875, from the observatory at Hamilton College, Clinton, New York. Peters named it after Adeona, the Roman goddess of homecoming, because he had recently returned from a journey across the world to observe the transit of Venus. Peters also discovered 144 Vibilia on the same night.

During 2001, &quot;Adeona&quot; was observed by radar from the Arecibo Observatory. The returned signal matched an effective diameter of 151 ± 18 km. This is consistent with the asteroid dimensions computed through other means.

Two stellar occultations by &quot;Adeona&quot; have been observed: The first one on July 9, 2002 when it occulted an 11.8 mag star, and then again on February 3, 2005 when several observers in Japan recorded the occultation of a 10.4 mag star. The latter was consistent with a diameter of 151 km.

The &quot;Dawn&quot; mission team discussed performing a flyby of this object, however NASA decided against it in July 2016. At the time this was considered Dawn was orbiting the large asteroid/dwarf planet 1 Ceres, and went on studying that body later that year. &quot;Dawn&quot; had previously orbited asteroid 4 Vesta, before traveling to Ceres.

<doc id="743990" wikidata="Q649299" url="?curid=743990" title="Regis University">
<text>Regis University ( ) is a private Jesuit university in Denver, Colorado, United States. Founded in 1877 by the Society of Jesus, the university offers more than 120 degrees through three colleges in a variety of subjects, including education, liberal arts, business, nursing, and technology. It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Regis is one of 27 Jesuit Catholic universities in the United States, and is the only Jesuit institution in the Rocky Mountain region.

==History==
In 1877, a group of exiled Italian Jesuits established a small college in Las Vegas, New Mexico. The Jesuits named this institution Las Vegas College which would ultimately become known as Regis University.

In 1884, the Bishop of Denver invited the Jesuits to create a college in Morrison, Colorado where Sacred Heart College was opened. In 1887, Las Vegas College and Sacred Heart College merged and moved to the present location of Regis University. At the time of the merger, the school was then called the College of the Sacred Heart. Later, in 1921, it adopted the name of Regis College in honor of Saint John Francis Regis, a 17th-century Jesuit who worked with prostitutes and the poor in the mountains of Southern France. The preparatory section was separated to become the present-day Regis Jesuit High School.

In 1991, Regis College was renamed Regis University.

Regis University played host to the rock musician Jimi Hendrix in 1968, as well as the British rock band Queen, who played their first concert in the United States at Regis, on April 16, 1974.

In 2011, Regis academic programs expanded with partnerships with the National University of Ireland, Galway, and with ITESO, the Jesuit University of Guadalajara, Mexico, for the first online bilingual joint MBA degree program.

On June 1, 2012, Michael Sheeran stepped down as the university&#x27;s president. He was succeeded by John P. Fitzgibbons, S.J., who became the 24th president of the university.

The university&#x27;s current president is Salvador Aceves, the first non-clergyman to hold the role.

===Guest speakers===
Desmond Tutu spoke at the university in November 1998, following in the footsteps of Betty Williams of Northern Ireland and the Dalai Lama in 1993.

Other speakers have included author Elie Wiesel in 2001, former President of Poland Lech Walesa in 2003, and most recently, David Trimble of Northern Ireland in 2006. Altogether, 13 Nobel Peace Prize recipients have visited Regis University since 1996.

===Papal visit===
On August 12, 1993, Pope John Paul II visited the Northwest Denver Campus of Regis University, where he met with President Bill Clinton for the first time. They greeted about 150 visitors, who had been chosen through a lottery system, and met privately for an hour in the President&#x27;s Dining Room of Carroll Hall.

==Schools==

===Regis College===
Regis College houses the traditional, undergraduate (and Masters of Art in Education &amp; Masters of Science in Biomedical Sciences) programs. These programs are designed for recent high school graduates, or transfer students, with little or no professional work experience. Regis college offers a choice of majors, minors, emphases, and pre-professional tracks. Students wishing to enter the nursing, physical therapy, or pharmacy programs often enter Regis College to complete pre-requisite requirements.

===Rueckert-Hartman College for Health Professions===
When Regis absorbed her sister school, Loretto Heights College, the Rueckert Hartman College for Health Professions was born. Regis operates a nationally recognized nursing program, and one of the premiere physical therapist programs. The school is divided into three schools and two divisions: Loretto Heights School of Nursing, School of Pharmacy, School of Physical Therapy, Division of Health Services Education and the Division of Counseling and Family Therapy. The college offers three doctoral programs, Doctor of Nursing Practice (entirely on-line), Doctor of Physical Therapy, and Doctor of Pharmacy.

===Anderson College of Business and Computing===
In 2015, the College of Business and Economics was officially established to combine the Regis College Division of Business and the College for Professional Studies School of Management and Master of Nonprofit Management. After a donation made by Denver architect Andy Anderson in 2018, the college was renamed to the Anderson College of Business. The college offers both classroom-based and online course options. Undergraduate programs in Computer Science (CPS), Computer Information Systems, and Computer Networking are ABET accredited. They are the only ABET accredited programs of their kind that, in addition to classroom, are also offered 100% online.

==Center for Service Learning==
Regis University&#x27;s Center for Service Learning (CSL) facilitates student voluntary service, the development of service learning components in coursework, and placement among the needier members of society for those with work study awards. These are essential components of the university&#x27;s mission to train men and women for others.

==Athletics==
Regis University is in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference along with Adams State, Black Hills State, Chadron State, Colorado Christian, Colorado Mines, CSU Pueblo, Dixie State, Fort Lewis, Colorado Mesa, Metro State, New Mexico Highlands, South Dakota Mines, UC-Colorado Springs, Western New Mexico, Westminster, and Western State Colorado. The university offers women&#x27;s lacrosse, men and women&#x27;s soccer, baseball, softball, men and women&#x27;s basketball, volleyball, men and women&#x27;s cross country, men and women&#x27;s golf, Men’s Rugby and forensics.

==Rankings==
Regis University was ranked 202nd among National Universities by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2020 rankings. This was Regis&#x27;s first year of competition on this national list since it was reclassified in 2019 as a Doctoral/Professional University. It had previously been ranked 26th among &quot;Regional Universities West&quot;.

<text>The Organization of World Heritage Cities (OWHC) is an international non-profit, non-governmental organization of 250 cities in which sites of the UNESCO World Heritage list are located. It was founded in 1993 in Fez, Morocco, during the second International Symposium of World Heritage Cities. The headquarters of the OWHC are located in Quebec City, Canada. Altogether the 250 member cities of the OWHC have a population of more than 130 million.

== History ==
During the first International Symposium of World Heritage Cities in Québec City in 1991, the participating 41 cities adopted the Québec City Declaration. This declaration states the desire to build a network of World Heritage Cities.

At the second International Symposium of World Heritage Cities in Fez, Morocco, the OWHC was founded in 1993. 56 participating cities decided on the mission, goals and powers of the organisation. At the Founding General Assembly, the member cities elected the first Board of Directors and Secretary General.

Since the first General Assembly, the member cities have been meeting every two years. Listed below are the years, locations and topics of the previous General Assemblies.
* 1995 Bergen (Norway): Communication between World Heritage Cities
* 1997 Evora (Portugal): Tourism and World Heritage – Challenges and Opportunities
* 1999 Santago de Compostela (Spain): Innovation in the Management of World Heritage Cities
* 2001 Puebla (Mexico): Prevention and Protection Measures for World Heritage Cities in Case of Disaster
* 2003 Rhodes (Greece)
* 2005 Cusco (Peru): Heritage of Humanity, Heritage with Humanity
* 2007 Kazan (Russian Federation): Heritage and Economics
* 2009 Quito (Ecuador): The revitalization of historic centres: how to involve all social actors?
* 2011 Sintra (Portugal): World Heritage Cities and Climate Change
* 2013 Oaxaca (Mexico): Heritage Cities, Sustainable Cities
* 2015 Arequipa (Peru): World Heritage Cities, Resilent Cities
* 2017 Ahmedabad (India): World Heritage cities
* 2017 Asmara (Eritrea): World Heritage cities, Africa&#x27;s Modernest city

== Organization ==
Any city may become a member of the OWHC if it possesses the following two characteristics. Firstly the city has to be the location of a living urban fabric of historic or contemporary interest. Its outstanding universal value has been recognized by the UNESCO and therefore has been registered in the World Heritage List. Secondly the city has to adhere to the values of the OWHC.

The General Assembly is the paramount authority of the OWHC. In it the member cities are represented by their mayor. To be able to take part in the General Assembly and have the right to vote the city has to be a member in good standing (pay the annual membership fee). The General Assembly meets every two years. Special Assemblies may be called by members or the board of directors.

At the General Assembly the mayors discuss issues concerning the mission and objectives of the OWHC and formulate relevant recommendations to the board of directors. The Assembly guides the activities of the Organization, studies and approves the Organization&#x27;s work program and controls the financial policy of the Organization.

The Board of Directors consists of eight mayors of members in good standing. It is elected by the General Assembly for two years. Directors may be elected two more times and therefore be directors for a maximum of six consecutive years. The Board of Directors meets at least once a year.

Among its duties are the implementation of the requests formulated and the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the planning of the organizations activities according to set up priorities. Furthermore, the Board of Directors examines the financial reports, authorizes the annual budget plan, prepares budget estimates and proposes their adoption to the general assembly. The Board of Directors also draws up the organization chart, the recruiting criteria and standards for the personnel of the General Secretariat and performs any other duty that could be assigned to it by the General Assembly. It is empowered to take all the measures required for the administration of the Organization and the attainment of its objectives.

The Board of Directors elects the President of the OWHC from among themselves. He is the chief executive officer of the OWHC and is tasked with the supervision, administration and management of the affairs of the Organization. He represents the OWHC at the national and international levels and binds the Organization in official acts.

The General Secretariat is headed by the Secretary General who is appointed by the General Assembly for a four-year term. He oversees the execution of mandates by the members, the day-to-day administration and personnel management and hiring. He also coordinates the activities of the OWHC, prepares the budget and the financial reports and ensures that the decisions of the board of directors and those of the members taken at the General Assembly are carried out.

The General Secretariat is supported in its duties by seven Regional Secretariats. They are groupings of cities that share cultural, linguistic or geographical affinities and/or have the same concerns and needs. Every member city of the OWHC is allowed to be part of one or more regions. The members of one region have to choose a city from among themselves as domicile for the Regional Secretariat, choose a Regional Coordinator and meet at least once a year. They serve as a link between the member cities of their particular region and the General Secretariat.

The seven Regional Secretariats are
* Regensburg (Germany) for the North-West European Region
* Budapest (Hungary) for the Central and Eastern European Region
* Córdoba (Spain) for the South-European and Mediterranean Region
* Valparaiso (Chile) for the Latinamerican and Caribbean Region
* Kazan (Russian Federation) for the Euro-Asian Region
* Tunis (Tunisia) for Africa and the Middle East
* Gyeongju (South Korea) for the Asia-Pacific Region

To support the General Secretariat the Regional Secretariats assist in producing documents intended for members, data collection and the organization of relevant events. They aim to make it possible for each member to participate more extensively in the activities of the Organization, to foster communication and the exchange of information amongst themselves and to promote the development of the Organization and its presence and influence. To accomplish those aims the Regional Secretariats organize activities intended to promote the Organization&#x27;s values and objectives.

The OWHC has five official languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic. Of those English, French and Spanish are working languages.

== Goals ==
During the founding of the OWHC in 1993 the member cities defined the goals and mission the Organization should have in the future. At the fourth General Assembly in Evora (Portugal) in 1997 the OWHC confirmed the Organization&#x27;s association with the UNESCO and their joint efforts regarding World Heritage Cities in the UNESCO-OWHC agreement.

The OWHC aims for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention (&quot;Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage adopted by the UNESCO in 1972&quot;). It encourages cooperation and exchange of information and expertise among its member cities on both regional and international levels. The OWHC works in close collaboration with other organizations pursuing similar goals while promoting action likely to support the efforts of cities located in developing countries. It assists members to adapt and improve their management methods in relation to the specific requirements of having a site inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Moreover, the organization ensures better links between research undertaken by specialists and the needs of the local managements. In addition the Organization intends to help develop a sense of solidarity among its member cities and to sensitize the populations to heritage values and their protection.

== Tasks and projects ==
The OWHC organizes meetings on international and regional levels. In addition to the biennial General Assemblies there are World Congresses, conferences, seminars and workshops. All those meetings deal with the challenges in the realm of management and strategies pertaining to the preservation and development of historic cities. To accomplish its goals the OWHC additionally offers various activities, programs and projects which aim to promote and support the maintenance, recognition and development of world heritage.

Current projects include &quot;Youth on the Trail of World Heritage&quot;, &quot;City2City&quot;, &quot;The Jean-Paul-L’Allier Prize for Heritage&quot;, an International Video Production Competition, the &quot;Solidarity day of World Heritage Cities&quot;, &quot;Mayors&amp;Heritage&quot; and &quot;Case Studies.&quot;

<text>Kauno autobusų gamykla (), abbreviated KAG, was a factory in Kaunas, Lithuanian SSR that produced about 10,000 KAG-3 buses from 1956 to 1990. The buses used chassis of the GAZ-51 truck. The factory then added wooden frames covered with metal sheets. It was the only mass-produced vehicle in Lithuania.

The factory was established in an old workshop owned by (Lithuanian American Joint Stock Company), abbreviated as Amlit. The company imported Ford cars, Fordson tractors, and bicycles. Around 1929, it started building passenger buses with wooden frames based on Ford chassis. About 25 buses were produced per year. The company was nationalised after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union. After World War II there was a shortage of vehicles and metal. The auto shop, then known as Kauno autoremonto gamykla, started modifying ZIS-150 trucks into L-1 buses that were first designed and produced in Leningrad in 1949.

In 1952, the factory started building KAG-1 passenger buses, which were copies of the Russian GZA-651 buses and were built on the GAZ-51 chassis. The factory improved the model and developed its own KAG-3 bus, though it retained essentially the same specifications. The buses had a six-cylinder, 68 horsepower, 3.5-litre engines. An empty bus weighted . KAG-3 was the most popular model, with up to 350 vehicles produced per year.

The wooden frame would rot over time, which is why only a couple buses have survived. Examples are preserved in museums in Kaunas and Vievis, as well as by a classic car club in Kaunas. The wooden frame could also easily catch fire in an accident. One of the largest accidents occurred in winter 1966, when a crowded bus drove into a ditch and caught fire on the road from Luokė to Smilgiai. 21 people died in the accident, four others suffered severe burns. Due to safety concerns, the buses were phased out from passenger transport and converted into cargo or utility vehicles. However, the KAG buses remained in demand even after metal frame buses (such as PAZ-652) became available. The wooden frame could be replaced (some buses had 3 or 4 frame changes) and performed better on uneven roads (such as roads of the Caucasus).

==Models==
The factory produces these models:
* KAG-1 (19 passengers) – very similar to the Russian GZA-651 buses
* KAG-3 (23 seated passengers plus 7 standing passengers)
** KAG-31 (KAG-3 based cargo van)
** KAG-32 (KAG-3 based bread van)
** KAG-33 (KAG-3 based technical service van)
** KAG-34 (KAG-3 based explosive materials van)
** KAG-317 (KAG-3 based household service van)
* KAG-4 (24 passenger) – two experimental vehicles with all metal frames produced in 1959
** KAG-41 (KAG-4 based cargo van) – one experimental vehicle with all metal frame produced in 1959

<text>The cheeks () constitute the area of the face below the eyes and between the nose and the left or right ear. Buccal means relating to the cheek. In humans, the region is innervated by the buccal nerve. The area between the inside of the cheek and the teeth and gums is called the [[vestibule of the mouth|vestibule]] or buccal&quot; pouchor buccal&quot; cavity and forms part of the mouth. In other animals, the cheeks may also be referred to as &quot;s&quot;.

==Structure==
Cheeks are fleshy in humans, the skin being suspended by the chin and the jaws, and forming the lateral wall of the human mouth, visibly touching the cheekbone below the eye. The inside of the cheek is lined with a mucous membrane (&quot;buccal&quot; mucosa, part of the oral mucosa).

During mastication (chewing), the cheeks and tongue between them serve to keep the food between the teeth.

==Clinical significance==
The cheek is the most common location from which a DNA sample can be taken. (Some saliva is collected from inside the mouth, e.g. using a cotton-tipped rod called a swab or &quot;&quot;. The procedure of collecting a sample in that way is typically called a &quot;cheek swab&quot;.)

==Other animals==
The cheeks are covered externally by hairy skin, and internally by stratified squamous epithelium. This is mostly smooth, but may have caudally directed papillae (e.g., in ruminants). The mucosa is supplied with secretions from the &quot;buccal&quot; glands, which are arranged in superior and inferior groups. In carnivores, the superior buccal gland is large and discrete: the zygomatic gland. During mastication, the cheeks and tongue between them serve to keep the food between the teeth.

Some animals such as squirrels and hamsters use the buccal pouch to carry food or other items.
In some vertebrates, markings on the cheek area, particularly immediately beneath the eye, often serve as important distinguishing features between species or individuals.

<text>Kim Sun-il (; 13 September 1970-) was a South Korean interpreter and Christian missionary who was kidnapped and murdered by decapitation in Iraq.

==Early life and education==
Kim was born into a poor family and his biological mother died when he was nine years old.

He was fluent in Arabic, holding a graduate degree in the language from Seoul&#x27;s Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in February 2003. He also had degrees in English and theology, and had hoped to become a missionary in the Middle East.

==Kidnapping ==

===Arrival===
Kim arrived in Iraq on 15 June 2003, working for Gana General Trading Company, a South Korean company under contract to the American military. On 30 May 2004, he was kidnapped in Fallujah — about west of Baghdad — by the Islamist group Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad and held as a hostage. The group, which was allegedly led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, killed him on or about 22 June when South Korea refused to meet their demands of cancelling its plans of sending 3,000 more troops to Iraq and withdrawing the 660 military medics and engineers already there. (This would put South Korea behind only the United Kingdom in number of non-U.S. coalition troops in Iraq.)

===Murder===
Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad had initially set a 21 June deadline in a videotape showing Kim pleading for his life. However, on 22 June, after initial reports that the militants had given their hostage more time, Al Jazeera television reported that they had received a videotape footage of Kim being decapitated by five men, like hostages Nick Berg and Eugene Armstrong in Iraq, Paul Johnson in Saudi Arabia, and Daniel Pearl in Pakistan. The report was subsequently confirmed by the South Korean government. In the murder video, Kim is wearing an orange jumpsuit and blindfolded. One of the captors reads a statement and then another takes out a knife and decapitates him. The statement said: &quot;Korean citizens, you were warned, your hands were the ones who killed him. Enough lies, enough cheatings. Your soldiers are here not for the sake of Iraqis, but for cursed America.&quot;

The president of Gana General Trading is said to have known about the kidnapping almost immediately, but he did not report it until after the videotape aired. He had consulted a lawyer, who argued that the situation must be managed without government intervention if Kim was to be saved. It is claimed that government officials had little time to react. However, there are also reports that a videotape of Kim in captivity, in which he appears calm and openly criticizes U.S. intervention in Iraq, was delivered to the Associated Press Television News offices in Baghdad in the beginning of June, and that on 3 June an AP reporter in Seoul contacted the South Korean foreign ministry asking if they knew of a missing person with a name similar to Kim Sun-il&#x27;s.

==Reactions==
South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun&#x27;s National Security Council issued a statement condemning the killing. South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Information and Communication banned the Kim Sun-il murder video and was trying to prevent it from being spread. The unedited video was available on the website Ogrish.com during the summer of 2004. The website received DDoS attacks as a result of hosting the footage.

U.S. President George W. Bush condemned the killers, saying: &quot;The free world cannot be intimidated by the brutal actions of these barbaric people.&quot;

Reports and editorials in South Korea&#x27;s press reflected despair at the death of the hostage Kim Sun-il in Iraq, but also defiance toward the kidnappers. South Korean TV stations interrupted their schedules when Mr Kim&#x27;s body was discovered and subsequently broadcast special rolling news programmes. &quot;Kim Sun-il killed - body identified&quot; was the headline in the independent daily &quot;The Dong-A Ilbo&quot;. &quot;Kim Sun-il ends up dead&quot; was how the popular daily JoongAng Ilbo reported it. In South Korea, thousands of people rallied against the South Korean military going to Iraq, and to express anger about Kim&#x27;s death, they burned portraits of the mastermind of his killing, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The South Korean government eventually passed a law barring passport issuance for 1–3 years to South Koreans who &quot;damage national prestige&quot;; the law was interpreted as an attempt to curtail Christian missionaries, especially after the 2007 South Korean hostage crisis in Afghanistan.

<doc id="744008" wikidata="Q1057649" url="?curid=744008" title="Tandoori chicken">
<text>Tandoori chicken is a dish made from chicken marinated in yogurt and spices and roasted in a &quot;tandoor&quot;, a cylindrical clay oven. The dish is now popular worldwide. The modern form of the dish was popularized by the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi, India in the late 1940s. It is also popular in Pakistan.

==History==
Chicken roasted in tandoor-like ovens is documented in the Harappan civilization of the Bronze Age of Indian subcontinent, as early as 3000 BC. Much later, the Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after being seasoned with black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices.

Tandoori chicken as a dish originated in the Punjab before the independence of partition of India. In the late 1940s, tandoori chicken was popularised at Moti Mahal in the locality of Daryaganj in New Delhi by Kundan Lal Jaggi, Kundan Lal Gujral and Thakur Das Magu, who were Punjabi Hindu migrants from Peshawar as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant. They used to work at a small eatery called Moti Mahal, owned by a man named Mokha Singh Lamba in Peshawar, British India, from the 1920s to 1947.

Tandoori chicken was popularized in post-independence India by Moti Mahal, Daryaganj in Delhi when it was served to the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. There, tandoori chicken became a standard offering at official banquets.

In the United States, tandoori chicken began appearing on menus by the 1960s. Jacqueline Kennedy was reported to have eaten &quot;chicken tandoori&quot; on a flight from Rome to Bombay in 1962. A recipe for tandoori chicken was printed in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1963, for &quot;the hostess in search of a fresh idea for a party dinner&quot;; a similar recipe was featured in the same newspaper in 1964.

==Preparation==

Raw chicken parts are skinned then marinated in a mixture of dahi (yogurt) and &quot;tandoori masala&quot;, a spice blend. They are seasoned and colored with cayenne pepper, red chili powder, or Kashmiri red chili powder as well as turmeric or food coloring.

The marinated chicken is placed on skewers and cooked at high temperatures in a tandoor oven, which is heated with charcoal or wood, which adds to the smoky flavour. The dish can also be cooked in a standard oven, using a spit or rotisserie, or over hot charcoal.

There are also tandoori recipes for whole chicken, some of which are cooked in a tandoor and others over charcoal. These include &quot;Chirga&quot; (Roasted whole chicken); &quot;Tandoori Murgh&quot; (Roast whole chicken with almonds); &quot;Murgh Kabab Seekhi (&quot;Whole stuffed chicken on the spit); &quot;Kookarh Tandoori&quot; (Steamed chicken on spit); &quot;Tandoori Murgh Massaledarh&quot; (Whole spiced chicken on spit); and &quot;Murghi Bhogar&quot; (Chicken in the Bhogar style).

==Cuisine==
Tandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter or appetizer, or as a main course, often served with naan flatbread. It is also used as the base of numerous cream-based curries, such as butter chicken. 

==Variations==
The fame of tandoori chicken led to many derivatives, such as chicken &quot;tikka&quot; (and eventually the Indian dish popularized in Britain, &quot;chicken tikka masala&quot;), commonly found in menus in Indian restaurants all over the world. Nearly all derivatives of tandoori chicken begin with a yogurt and citrus-based marinade.

<doc id="744024" wikidata="Q817316" url="?curid=744024" title="Coat of arms of the Ottoman Empire">
<text>Every sultan of the Ottoman Empire had his own monogram, called the &quot;tughra&quot;, which served as a royal symbol. A coat of arms in the European heraldic sense was created in the late 19th century. Hampton Court requested from the Ottoman Empire a coat of arms to be included in their collection. As the coat of arms had not been previously used in the Ottoman Empire, it was designed following this request of Mahmud II, and the final design was adopted by Sultan Abdul Hamid II on 17 April 1882.

==Design==
At the heart of the design is a shield adorned with a turban, which serves as the &quot;crown&quot; of the Ottoman monarch. Above the shield, a sun symbolizes the grandeur of the nation, upon which the sultan&#x27;s tughra and chosen motto are inscribed. To the left, a red book and a green book represent the Islamic and modern laws of the empire. Atop these books, a scale stands as a symbol of justice. The blooming flowers near it also represent justice in Islamic symbolism. Encircling the shield are an assortment of weapons, balancing ancient armaments with modern weaponry. A red flag representing the secular institutions of the state stands alongside the green Standard of the Caliph. Beyond the coat, the Ottoman Orders of Merit are displayed.

At the top, golden light rays radiate from the sun with the tughra seal of the sultan inscribed in golden letters on a green disk background. The tughra reads in Arabic, &quot;Mahmud Khan son of Abdulhamid, forever victorious&quot;, written out as: محمود خان بن عبد الحميد مظفر دائماً (Mahmūd Ḫān bin Abdulhamīd muẓaffar dāʾimā). The inscription in the large green crescent reads in Arabic: &quot;Relying on Divine success, the king of the Sublime Ottoman State&quot;, written out as: المستند بالتوفيقات الربانية ملك الدولة العلية العثمانية (al-Mustanidu bi&#x27;t-Tawfiqāti&#x27;r-Rabbānīyah Malik ad-Dawlatu&#x27;l-Alīyati&#x27;l-Uthmāniyah).

Hanging beneath the lower flourish are the medals of five Ottoman military decorations.

<text>Dirk Jan de Geer (14 December 1870 – 28 November 1960) was a Dutch politician of the Christian Historical Union. He served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 8 March 1926 until 10 August 1929, and from 10 August 1939 until 3 September 1940.

==Life==
Born in Groningen, he was a descendant of the De Geer family. After receiving his J.D. in 1895, De Geer worked as a journalist and acted as a town councillor of Rotterdam (1901–1907).

He served from 1907 as a Christian Historical member of Parliament. Before World War II, he was a stable and respected politician. From 1920 to 1921, he served as mayor of Arnhem. Between 1921 and 1923, De Geer served as Minister of Finance. He resigned in 1923 because of his disagreement with the Naval Law of 1924. From 1925 to 1926 he served as Minister of the Interior and Minister of Agriculture, then was Prime Minister from 8 March 1926 to 10 August 1929. He also served as Minister of Finance from 1926 to 1933.

After the fall of the fifth cabinet of Hendrikus Colijn, De Geer again formed a government in August 1939 and concurrently held the offices of Minister of Finance and of General Affairs. However, as he knew, he was not suited for the role of prime minister of a nation at war. When Nazi Germany attacked the Netherlands on 10 May 1940 (beginning of the Western campaign), the situation soon became very serious, and the government fled to Britain.

In Britain, De Geer advocated negotiating a separate peace between the Netherlands and Germany and damaged the Dutch government and Dutch morale by openly stating that the war could never be won. At the instigation of Queen Wilhelmina, he was removed from office and replaced by Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy – officially on account of ill-health.

Later, he was sent with a diplomatic package to the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia. He never arrived there, for on a stopover in Portugal he left the flight and went to the Germans, who allowed him to return to his ailing wife and the rest of his family in the Netherlands.

That greatly angered Wilhelmina, who called him a traitor and deserter to the Dutch cause. He later wrote a controversial leaflet with &quot;instructions&quot; for the people on how to co-operate with the Germans. &quot;With this pamphlet&quot;, the Dutch government-in-exile stated in a broadcast, &quot;the writer has betrayed the Netherlands people, whatever happens to him personally&quot;. Wilhelmina warned De Geer that if he published the pamphlet, he would be put on trial after the conclusion of the war.

With the permission of the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, De Geer went through with the publication. After the war, he was found guilty of high treason in time of war and was stripped of all of his honorary titles. The Appeal Court confirmed the sentence of a year&#x27;s imprisonment with three years&#x27; probation, but waived the fine of 20,000 guilders and the deprivation of the title &quot;Minister of State&quot;.

==Personal==
On 11 August 1904, De Geer married Maria Voorhoeve (1 May 1883 – 6 April 1955).

His grandson is ex-footballer Boudewijn de Geer, and his great-grandson is current footballer Mike de Geer.

==Death==
De Geer died on 28 November 1960 at Soest, Netherlands, at the age of 89, 16 days before his 90th birthday, several years after having suffered a stroke.

<text>Arka Gdynia, also known as AMW Arka Gdynia for sponsorship reasons, is a Polish professional basketball team, based in Gdynia. The team plays in the Polish PLK. The club&#x27;s sponsorship name comes from Akademią Marynarki Wojennej. Historically the team is one of the most successful in Poland, mainly because of the nine championships in a row the team won from 2004 to 2012.
==History==
The team was founded in 1995, as STK Trefl Sopot. In its first season, the team won the Polish third division and promotion to the Polish second division. In the 1996–97 season, after winning Group B of the Polish second division, the team was promoted to the top Polish Basketball League, the Dominet Bank Ekstraliga.

In 2003, Prokom Trefl played in the final of the FIBA Europe Champions Cup, against Aris. Starting in 2004, the team began to play in the EuroLeague. In its first EuroLeague season, the club became the first Polish team to reach the EuroLeague&#x27;s Top 16 stage. In 2009, the club relocated from Sopot to its neighbouring city of Gdynia within the Tricity. Through the 2012–13 season, it was one of 14 clubs across Europe that held Euroleague Basketball A Licenses, which (normally) gave their holders an automatic place in the Regular Season phase of the EuroLeague.

In 2018, the club changed its name to Arka Gdynia. It also made a return to European-wide competitions for the first time in 6 years, by playing in the 2018–19 EuroCup.

<doc id="744036" wikidata="Q999803" url="?curid=744036" title="Sublime (philosophy)">
<text>In aesthetics, the sublime (from the Latin &quot;&quot;) is the of greatness, whether physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual, or artistic. The term especially refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement, or imitation.

Since its first application in the field of rhetoric and drama in ancient Greece it became an important concept not just in philosophical aesthetics but also in literary theory and art history.

==Ancient philosophy==
The first known study of the &quot;sublime&quot; is ascribed to Longinus: Peri Hupsous/Hypsous or &quot;On the Sublime&quot;. This is thought to have been written in the 1st century AD though its origin and authorship are uncertain. For Longinus, the sublime is an adjective that describes great, elevated, or lofty thought or language, particularly in the context of rhetoric. As such, the sublime inspires awe and veneration, with greater persuasive powers. Longinus&#x27; treatise is also notable for referring not only to Greek authors such as Homer, but also to biblical sources such as Genesis.

This treatise was rediscovered in the 16th century, and its subsequent impact on aesthetics is usually attributed to its translation into French by linguist Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux in 1674. Later the treatise was translated into English by John Pultney in 1680, Leonard Welsted in 1712, and William Smith in 1739 whose translation had its fifth edition in 1800.

==Modern philosophy==
The concept of the sublime emerged in Europe with the birth of literary criticism in the late 17th century. It was associated with the works of the French writers Pierre Corneille, Jean-Baptiste Racine, Jean-Baptiste l&#x27;Abbé Dubos, and Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux.

===British philosophy===
In Britain, the development of the concept of the sublime as an aesthetic quality in nature distinct from beauty was brought into prominence in the 18th century in the writings of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury and John Dennis. These authors expressed an appreciation of the fearful and irregular forms of external nature, and Joseph Addison&#x27;s synthesis of concepts of the sublime in his &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and later the &quot;Pleasures of the Imagination&quot;. All three Englishmen had, within the span of several years, made the journey across the Alps and commented in their writings of the horrors and harmony of the experience, expressing a contrast of aesthetic qualities.

John Dennis was the first to publish his comments in a journal letter published as &quot;Miscellanies&quot; in 1693, giving an account of crossing the Alps where, contrary to his prior feelings for the beauty of nature as a &quot;delight that is consistent with reason&quot;, the experience of the journey was at once a pleasure to the eye as music is to the ear, but &quot;mingled with Horrours, and sometimes almost with despair&quot;. Shaftesbury had made the journey two years prior to Dennis but did not publish his comments until 1709 in the &quot;Moralists&quot;. His comments on the experience also reflected pleasure and repulsion, citing a &quot;wasted mountain&quot; that showed itself to the world as a &quot;noble ruin&quot; (Part III, Sec. 1, 390–91), but his concept of the sublime in relation to beauty was one of degree rather than the sharp contradistinction that Dennis developed into a new form of literary criticism. Shaftesbury&#x27;s writings reflect more of a regard for the awe of the infinity of space (&quot;Space astonishes&quot; referring to the Alps), where the sublime was not an aesthetic quality in opposition to beauty, but a quality of a grander and higher importance than beauty. In referring to the Earth as a &quot;Mansion-Globe&quot; and &quot;Man-Container&quot; Shaftsbury writes &quot;How narrow then must it appear compar&#x27;d with the capacious System of its own Sun...tho animated with a sublime Celestial Spirit...&quot; (Part III, sec. 1, 373).

Joseph Addison embarked on the Grand Tour in 1699 and commented in &quot;Remarks on Several Parts of Italy etc.&quot; that &quot;The Alps fill the mind with an agreeable kind of horror&quot;. The significance of Addison&#x27;s concept of the sublime is that the three pleasures of the imagination that he identified—greatness, uncommonness, and beauty—&quot;arise from visible objects&quot;; that is, from sight rather than from rhetoric. It is also notable that in writing on the &quot;Sublime in external Nature&quot;, he does not use the term &quot;sublime&quot; but uses semi-synonymous terms such as &quot;unbounded&quot;, &quot;unlimited&quot;, &quot;spacious&quot;, &quot;greatness&quot;, and on occasion terms denoting excess.

The British description of the sublime has been described as distinct from the Kantian conceptualization, which emphasized a detachment of aesthetic judgment. The British tradition is noted for its rejection of the idea that aesthetic judgment and ethical conduct are not connected. One of its positions holds that the affective register of the sublime is not divorced from the standards that govern human conduct and that it does not transcend ethical conduct. 

====Edmund Burke====
Addison&#x27;s notion of greatness was integral to the concept of sublimity. An object of art could be beautiful yet it could not possess greatness. His &quot;Pleasures of the Imagination&quot;, as well as Mark Akenside&#x27;s &quot;Pleasures of the Imagination&quot; of 1744 and Edward Young&#x27;s poem &quot;Night Thoughts&quot; of 1745 are generally considered the starting points for Edmund Burke&#x27;s analysis of sublimity.

Edmund Burke developed his conception of sublimity in &quot;A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful&quot; of 1756. Burke was the first philosopher to argue that sublimity and beauty are &quot;mutually exclusive&quot;. The dichotomy that Burke articulated is not as simple as Dennis&#x27; opposition, and is antithetical in the same degree as light and darkness. Light may accentuate beauty, but either great light or darkness, i. e., the absence of light, is sublime to the extent that it can annihilate vision of the object in question. What is &quot;dark, uncertain, and confused&quot; moves the imagination to awe and a degree of horror. While the relationship of sublimity and beauty is one of mutual exclusivity, either can provide pleasure. Sublimity may evoke horror, but knowledge that the perception is a fiction is pleasureful.

Burke&#x27;s concept of sublimity was an antithetical contrast to the classical conception of the aesthetic quality of beauty being the pleasurable experience that Plato described in several of his dialogues, e. g. &quot;Philebus&quot;, &quot;Ion&quot;, &quot;Hippias Major&quot;, and &quot;Symposium&quot;, and suggested that ugliness is an aesthetic quality in its capacity to instill intense emotions, ultimately providing pleasure. For Aristotle, the function of artistic forms was to instill pleasure, and he first pondered the problem that an object of art representing ugliness produces &quot;pain.&quot; Aristotle&#x27;s detailed analysis of this problem involved his study of tragic literature and its paradoxical nature as both shocking and having poetic value. The classical notion of ugliness prior to Edmund Burke, most notably described in the works of Saint Augustine of Hippo, denoted it as the absence of form and therefore as a degree of non-existence. For St. Augustine, beauty is the result of the benevolence and goodness of God in His creation, and as a category it had no opposite. Because ugliness lacks any attributive value, it is formless due to the absence of beauty.

Burke&#x27;s treatise is also notable for focusing on the physiological effects of sublimity, in particular the dual emotional quality of fear and attraction that other authors noted. Burke described the sensation attributed to sublimity as a &quot;negative pain&quot;, which he denominated &quot;delight&quot; and which is distinct from positive pleasure. &quot;Delight&quot; is thought to result from the removal of pain, caused by confronting a sublime object, and supposedly is more intense than positive pleasure. Though Burke&#x27;s explanations for the physiological effects of sublimity, e. g. tension resulting from eye strain, were not seriously considered by later authors, his empirical method of reporting his own psychological experience was more influential, especially in contrast to the analysis of Immanuel Kant. Burke is also distinguished from Kant in his emphasis on the subject&#x27;s realization of his physical limitations rather than any supposed sense of moral or spiritual transcendence.

===German philosophy===
====Immanuel Kant====
In an early work (of 1764), Immanuel Kant made an attempt to record his thoughts on the observing subject&#x27;s mental state in &quot;Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime&quot;. He held that the sublime was of three kinds: the noble, the splendid, and the terrifying.

In his later &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; (1790), Kant says that there are two forms of the sublime, the mathematical and the dynamical, although some commentators hold that there is a third form, the moral sublime, a hold-over from the earlier &quot;noble&quot; sublime. Kant claims, &quot;We call that sublime which is absolutely great&quot;(§ 25). He distinguishes between the &quot;remarkable differences&quot; of the Beautiful and the Sublime, noting that beauty &quot;is connected with the form of the object&quot;, having &quot;boundaries&quot;, while the sublime &quot;is to be found in a formless object&quot;, represented by a &quot;boundlessness&quot; (§ 23). 

Kant divides the sublime into the mathematical and the dynamical, where in the mathematical &quot;aesthetical comprehension&quot; is not a consciousness of a merely greater unit, but the notion of absolute greatness not constrained by any idea of limitation (§ 27). The dynamically sublime is &quot;nature considered in an aesthetic judgment as might that has no dominion over us&quot;, and an object can create a fearfulness &quot;without [us] being afraid &quot;of&quot; it&quot; (§ 28). 

He considers both the beautiful and the sublime as &quot;indefinite&quot; concepts, but where beauty relates to the &quot;Understanding&quot;, sublime is a concept belonging to &quot;Reason&quot;, and &quot;shows a faculty of the mind surpassing every standard of Sense&quot; (§ 25). For Kant, one&#x27;s inability to grasp the magnitude of a sublime event (such as an earthquake) demonstrates the inadequacy of one&#x27;s sensibility and imagination. Simultaneously, one&#x27;s ability subsequently to identify such an event as singular and whole indicates the superiority of one&#x27;s cognitive, supersensible powers. Ultimately, it is this &quot;supersensible substrate,&quot; underlying both nature and thought, on which true sublimity is located.

====Arthur Schopenhauer====
To clarify the concept of the feeling of the sublime, Arthur Schopenhauer listed examples of its transition from the beautiful to the most sublime. This can be found in the first volume of his &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, § 39.

For him, the feeling of the beautiful is in seeing an object that invites the observer to transcend individuality, and simply observe the idea underlying the object. The feeling of the sublime, however, is when the object does not invite such contemplation but instead is an overpowering or vast malignant object of great magnitude, one that could destroy the observer.
*&quot;Feeling of Beauty&quot; – Light is reflected off a flower. (Pleasure from a mere perception of an object that cannot hurt observer).
*&quot;Weakest Feeling of Sublime&quot; – Light reflected off stones. (Pleasure from beholding objects that pose no threat, objects devoid of life).
*&quot;Weaker Feeling of Sublime&quot; – Endless desert with no movement. (Pleasure from seeing objects that could not sustain the life of the observer).
*&quot;Sublime&quot; – Turbulent Nature. (Pleasure from perceiving objects that threaten to hurt or destroy observer).
*&quot;Full Feeling of Sublime&quot; – Overpowering turbulent Nature. (Pleasure from beholding very violent, destructive objects).
*&quot;Fullest Feeling of Sublime&quot; – Immensity of Universe&#x27;s extent or duration. (Pleasure from knowledge of observer&#x27;s nothingness and oneness with Nature).

====Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel====
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel considered the sublime a marker of cultural difference and a characteristic feature of oriental art. His teleological view of history meant that he considered &quot;oriental&quot; cultures as less developed, more autocratic in terms of their political structures and more fearful of divine law. According to his reasoning, this meant that oriental artists were more inclined towards the aesthetic and the sublime: they could engage God only through &quot;sublated&quot; means. He believed that the excess of intricate detail that is characteristic of Chinese art, or the dazzling metrical patterns characteristic of Islamic art, were typical examples of the sublime and argued that the disembodiment and formlessness of these art forms inspired the viewer with an overwhelming aesthetic sense of awe.

====Rudolf Otto====
Rudolf Otto compared the sublime with his newly coined concept of the numinous. The numinous comprises terror, &quot;Tremendum&quot;, but also a strange fascination, &quot;Fascinans&quot;.

==Contemporary philosophy==
===20th century===
At the beginning of the 20th century Neo-Kantian German philosopher and theorist of aesthetics Max Dessoir founded the &quot;Zeitschrift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft&quot;, which he edited for many years, and published the work &quot;Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft&quot; in which he formulated five primary aesthetic forms: the beautiful, the sublime, the tragic, the ugly, and the comic.

The experience of the sublime involves a self-forgetfulness where personal fear is replaced by a sense of well-being and security when confronted with an object exhibiting superior might, and is similar to the experience of the tragic. The &quot;tragic consciousness&quot; is the capacity to gain an exalted state of consciousness from the realization of the unavoidable suffering destined for all men and that there are oppositions in life that can never be resolved, most notably that of the &quot;forgiving generosity of deity&quot; subsumed to &quot;inexorable fate&quot;.

Thomas Weiskel re-examined Kant&#x27;s aesthetics and the Romantic conception of the sublime through the prism of semiotic theory and psychoanalysis. He argued that Kant&#x27;s &quot;mathematical sublime&quot; could be seen in semiotic terms as the presence of an excess of signifiers, a monotonous infinity threatens to dissolve all oppositions and distinctions. The &quot;dynamic sublime&quot;, on the other hand, was an excess of signifieds: meaning was always overdetermined.

According to Jean-François Lyotard, the sublime, as a theme in aesthetics, was the founding move of the Modernist period. Lyotard argued that the modernists attempted to replace the beautiful with the release of the perceiver from the constraints of the human condition. For him, the sublime&#x27;s significance is in the way it points to an &quot;aporia&quot; (impassable doubt) in human reason; it expresses the edge of our conceptual powers and reveals the multiplicity and instability of the postmodern world.

===21st century===
According to Mario Costa, the concept of the sublime should be examined first of all in relation to the epochal novelty of digital technologies, and technological artistic production: new media art, computer-based generative art, networking, telecommunication art. For him, the new technologies are creating conditions for a new kind of sublime: the &quot;technological sublime&quot;. The traditional categories of aesthetics (beauty, meaning, expression, feeling) are being replaced by the notion of the sublime, which after being &quot;natural&quot; in the 18th century, and &quot;metropolitan-industrial&quot; in the modern era, has now become technological.

There has also been some resurgence of interest in the sublime in analytic philosophy since the early 1990s, with occasional articles in &quot;The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism&quot; and &quot;The British Journal of Aesthetics&quot;, as well as monographs by writers such as Malcolm Budd, James Kirwan and Kirk Pillow. As in the postmodern or critical theory tradition, analytic philosophical studies often begin with accounts of Kant or other philosophers of the 18th or early 19th centuries. Noteworthy is a general theory of the sublime, in the tradition of Longinus, Burke and Kant, in which Tsang Lap Chuen presents the notion of limit-situations in life as being central to the human experience.

Jadranka Skorin-Kapov in &quot;The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity&quot; argues for sublimity as the common root to aesthetics and ethics, &quot;The origin of surprise is the break (the pause, the rupture) between one&#x27;s sensibility and one&#x27;s powers of representation... The recuperation that follows the break between one&#x27;s sensibility and one&#x27;s representational capability leads to sublimity and the subsequent feelings of admiration and/or responsibility, allowing for the intertwining of aesthetics and ethics... The roles of aesthetics and ethics—that is, the roles of artistic and moral judgments, are very relevant to contemporary society and business practices, especially in light of the technological advances that have resulted in the explosion of visual culture and in the mixture of awe and apprehension as we consider the future of humanity.&quot;

<text>The Church of Saint Roch () is a Roman Catholic church dedicated to Saint Roch in Venice, northern Italy. It was built between 1489 and 1508 by Bartolomeo Bon the Younger, but was substantially altered in 1725. The façade dates from 1765 to 1771, and was designed by Bernardino Maccarucci. The church is one of the Plague-churches built in Venice.

St. Roch, whose relics rest in the church after their transfer from Voghera (trad. Montpellier), was declared a patron saint of the city in 1576. Every year, on his feast day (16 August), the Doge made a pilgrimage to the church.

Near the church is the &quot;Scuola Grande di San Rocco&quot;, noted for its numerous Tintoretto paintings. It was founded in the 15th century as a confraternity to assist the citizens in time of plague.

== Description ==
=== Exterior ===

On the sides are statues of Saint Gerolamo Emiliani and Blessed Pietro Acotanto. In the second register is a relief of &quot;Saint Roch healing the plague stricken&quot; by Giovanni Morlaiter. In the niches on the sides are statues of Saints Lorenzo Giustiniani and Gregorio Barbarigo by Antonio Gai. In the first register flanking the main entrance are Saints Gerardo Sagredo and Pietro Orseolo by Giovanni Marchiori. The main portal has a bronze copy relief of the &quot;Glory of Saint Roch&quot; by Malchiori. The marble original is inside the church.

<doc id="744047" wikidata="Q839697" url="?curid=744047" title="Tai Wo Hau station">
<text>Tai Wo Hau () is an MTR station between Tsuen Wan and Kwai Hing stations on the . It serves the areas of Kwai Yin Court and Tai Wo Hau Estate in the Kwai Tsing District, and some resited villages (such as Kwan Mun Hau Tsuen) in the Tsuen Wan District of Hong Kong. These villages were originally in Tsuen Wan town centre, being moved for new town development.

Tai Wo Hau station was one of the first railway stations in the New Territories; and the first underground one. All other New Territories stations on the Tsuen Wan line are either at surface level or on viaducts. Lai King station cuts through a hillside slope, and all other New Territories underground stations were opened some years later.
The station is relatively less busy in the system because of its distance to nearby bus stops and settlements.

==History==

The station was built on the site of a park. The 280-metre-long, 22-metre-wide, 15-metre-deep station box was built bottom-up within a sheetpile cofferdam. The station was built by a Japanese joint venture between Aoki Corporation and Tobishima Construction. The tunnel between Tai Wo Hau and Kwai Hing stations was completed in July 1980 using the drill-and-blast method. Tai Wo Hau station opened on 10 May 1982, in sync with Tsuen Wan line. In 1984, the New Territories Development Department awarded a contract for the construction of a park above the station to replace the one which originally existed there. This park is now called Kwok Shui Road Park.

==Station layout==
Platforms 1 and 2 share the same island platform.

==Entrances/exits==
* A: Hoi Pa San Tsuen, Ham Tin Tsuen, Ho Pui Tsuen, Kwok Shui Road, Primrose Hill

<text>148 Gallia is an asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 7 August 1875, by the French brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry at the Paris, but the credit for this discovery was given to Prosper. It was named after the Latin name for the country of France, Gaul. Based upon its spectrum, it is an unusual G-type asteroid (GU) and a stony S-type asteroid in the Tholen and SMASS classification, respectively.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the European Southern Observatory in 1977–78 gave a light curve with a period of and a brightness variation of 0.32 in magnitude. A 2007 study at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado, United States, yielded a period of 20.666 ± 0.002 hours with a magnitude variation of 0.21.

This object is the namesake of the Gallia family (), a small family of nearly 200 known stony asteroids that share similar spectral properties and orbital elements. Hence they may have arisen from the same collisional event. All members have a relatively high orbital inclination.

<doc id="744052" wikidata="Q1672808" url="?curid=744052" title="Irish Confederate Wars">
<text>The Irish Confederate Wars, also called the Eleven Years&#x27; War (), took place in Ireland between 1641 and 1653. It was the Irish theatre of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, a series of civil wars in the kingdoms of Ireland, England and Scotland – all ruled by Charles I. The conflict had political, religious and ethnic aspects and was fought over governance, land ownership, religious freedom and religious discrimination. The main issues were whether Irish Catholics or British Protestants held most political power and owned most of the land, and whether Ireland would be a self-governing kingdom under Charles I or subordinate to the parliament in England. It was the most destructive conflict in Irish history and caused 200,000–600,000 deaths from fighting as well as war-related famine and disease.

The war in Ireland began with a rebellion in 1641 by Irish Catholics, who tried to seize control of the English administration in Ireland. They wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination, to increase Irish self-governance, and to roll back the Plantations of Ireland. They also wanted to prevent an invasion by anti-Catholic English Parliamentarians and Scottish Covenanters, who were defying the king. Rebel leader Felim O&#x27;Neill claimed to be doing the king&#x27;s bidding, but Charles condemned the rebellion after it broke out. The rebellion developed into an ethnic conflict between Irish Catholics on one side, and English and Scottish Protestant colonists on the other. These first few months were marked by ethnic cleansing and massacres in Ulster.

Catholic leaders formed the Irish Catholic Confederation in May 1642, which controlled and governed most of Ireland, and comprised both Gaelic and old English Catholics. In the following months and years the Confederates fought against Royalists, Parliamentarians, and an army sent by Scottish Covenanters, with all sides using scorched earth tactics. Disagreements over how to deal with the rebellion helped spark the English Civil War in mid-1642. The king authorised secret negotiations with the Confederates, resulting in a Confederate–Royalist ceasefire in September 1643 and further negotiations. In 1644, a Confederate military expedition landed in Scotland to help Royalists there. The Confederates continued to fight the Parliamentarians in Ireland, and decisively defeated the Covenanter army in the Battle of Benburb. In 1647, the Confederates suffered a string of defeats by the Parliamentarians at Dungan&#x27;s Hill, Cashel and Knockanuss. This prompted the Confederates to make an agreement with the Royalists. The agreement divided the Confederates, and this infighting hampered their preparations to resist a Parliamentarian invasion.

In August 1649, a large English Parliamentarian army, led by Oliver Cromwell, invaded Ireland. It besieged and captured many towns from the Confederate–Royalist alliance. Cromwell&#x27;s army massacred many soldiers and civilians after storming the towns of Drogheda and Wexford. The Confederate capital Kilkenny was captured in March 1650, and the Confederate–Royalist alliance was eventually defeated with the capture of Galway in May 1652. Confederates continued a guerrilla campaign until April 1653. This saw widespread killing of civilians and destruction of foodstuffs by the English army, who also brought an outbreak of bubonic plague.

After the war, Ireland was occupied and annexed by the English Commonwealth, a republic which lasted until 1660. Catholicism was repressed, most Catholic-owned land was confiscated, and tens of thousands of Irish rebels were sent to the Caribbean or Virginia as indentured servants or joined Catholic armies in Europe.

==Overview==
The war in Ireland began with the Rebellion of 1641 in Ulster in October, during which many Scots and English Protestant settlers were killed. The rebellion spread throughout the country and at Kilkenny in 1642 the Association of The Confederate Catholics of Ireland was formed to organise the Catholic war effort. The Confederation was essentially an independent state and was a coalition of all shades of Irish Catholic society, both Gaelic and Old English. The Irish Confederates professed to side with the English Cavaliers during the ensuing civil wars, but mostly fought their own war in defence of the Catholic landed class&#x27;s interests.

The Confederates ruled much of Ireland as a &quot;de facto&quot; sovereign state until 1649, and proclaimed their loyalty to Charles I. From 1642 to 1649, the Confederates fought against Scottish Covenanter and English Parliamentarian armies in Ireland. The Confederates, in the context of the English Civil War, were loosely allied with the English Royalists, but were divided over whether to send military help to them in the war there. Ultimately, they never sent troops to England, but did send an expedition to help the Scottish Royalists, sparking the Scottish Civil War.

The wars produced an extremely fractured array of forces in Ireland. The Protestant forces were split into three main factions (English Royalist, English Parliamentarian and Scottish Covenanter) as a result of the civil wars in England and Scotland. The Catholic Confederates themselves split on more than one occasion over the issue of whether their first loyalty was to the Catholic religion or to King Charles I (see the principal factions in the war).

The wars ended in the defeat of the Confederates. They and their English Royalist allies were defeated during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland by the New Model Army under Oliver Cromwell in 1649–53. The wars following the 1641 revolt caused massive loss of life in Ireland, comparable in the country&#x27;s history only with the Great Famine of the 1840s. The ultimate winner, the English parliament, arranged for the mass confiscation of land owned by Irish Catholics as punishment for the rebellion and to pay for the war. Although some of this land was returned after 1660 on the Restoration of the monarchy in England, the period marked the effective end of the old Catholic landed class.

==The plot, October 1641==

The rebellion was intended to be a swift and mainly bloodless seizure of power in Ireland by a small group of conspirators led by Phelim O&#x27;Neill. Small bands of the plotters&#x27; kin and dependents were mobilized in Dublin, Wicklow and Ulster, to take strategic buildings like Dublin Castle. Since there were only a small number of English soldiers stationed in Ireland, this had a reasonable chance of succeeding. Had it done so, the remaining English garrisons could well have surrendered, leaving Irish Catholics in a position of strength to negotiate their demands for civil reform, religious toleration and Irish self-government. However, the plot was betrayed at the last minute and as a result, the rebellion degenerated into chaotic violence. Following the outbreak of hostilities, the resentment of the native Irish Catholic population against the British Protestant settlers exploded into violence. Shortly after the outbreak of the rebellion, O&#x27;Neill issued the Proclamation of Dungannon which offered justification for the rising. He claimed that he was acting on the orders of Charles I.

==The rebellion, 1641–42==
From 1641 to early 1642, the fighting in Ireland was characterised by small bands, raised by local lords or among local people, attacking civilians of opposing ethnic and religious groups. At first, Irish Catholic bands, particularly from Ulster, took the opportunity given them by the collapse of law and order to settle scores with Protestant settlers who had occupied Irish land in the plantations of Ireland. Initially, the Irish Catholic gentry raised militia forces to try to contain the violence but afterwards, when it was clear that the government in Dublin intended to punish all Catholics for the rebellion, participated in the attacks on Protestants and fought English troops sent to put down the rebellion. In areas where British settlers were concentrated, around Cork, Dublin, Carrickfergus and Derry, they raised their own militia in self-defence and managed to hold off the rebel forces. All sides displayed extreme cruelty in this phase of the war. Around 4,000 Protestants were massacred and a further 12,000 may have died of privation after being driven from their homes. In one notorious incident, the Protestant inhabitants of Portadown were taken captive and then massacred on the bridge in the town. The settlers responded in kind, as did the Government in Dublin, with attacks on the Irish civilian population. Massacres of Catholic civilians occurred at Rathlin Island and elsewhere. The rebels from Ulster defeated a government force at Julianstown, but failed to take nearby Drogheda and were scattered when they advanced on Dublin.

By early 1642, there were four main concentrations of rebel forces: in Ulster under Phelim O&#x27;Neill, in the Pale around Dublin led by Viscount Gormanstown, in the south-east, led by the Butler family – in particular Lord Mountgarret and in the south-west, led by Donagh MacCarthy, Viscount Muskerry.

==The Confederates&#x27; War, 1642–1648==
Charles I wanted control of Ireland to mobilise its resources against his opponents in England and Scotland; the Scots and their English Parliamentary allies aimed to prevent this. Over the course of 1642, 10,000 Scots funded by Parliament landed in Coleraine and Carrickfergus, while English forces re-established control over Dublin.

One of the last pieces of legislation approved by both Charles and Parliament before the outbreak of the First English Civil War was the March 1642 Adventurers&#x27; Act; this funded the war in Ireland by loans that would be repaid by the sale of lands held by the Irish rebels. As a result, neither side would tolerate the autonomous Catholic state demanded by Irish leaders and both were committed to further land confiscations; enforcing the Adventurers&#x27; Act was the primary objective of the 1649 Cromwellian conquest.

This resulted in the formation of Irish Confederacy, based at Kilkenny; by the end of 1642, it controlled two-thirds of Ireland, including the ports of Waterford and Wexford, through which they could receive aid from Catholic powers in Europe. While supported by most Irish Catholics, especially the clergy, many co-religionists among the upper classes were Royalists by inclination, who feared losing their own lands if the plantation settlements were overturned. Some fought against the Confederation; others like Clanricarde, stayed neutral.

Forces initially available to the Confederacy were primarily militia and private levies, commanded by aristocratic amateurs like Lord Mountgarret. These suffered a series of defeats, including Liscarroll, Kilrush, New Ross and Glenmaquinn, but the outbreak of the English Civil War in mid-1642 led to the recall of many English troops. This allowed Garret Barry, a returned Irish mercenary soldier, to capture Limerick in 1642, while the English garrison in Galway was forced to surrender by the townspeople in 1643.

By mid-1643, the Confederacy controlled large parts of Ireland, the exceptions being Ulster, Dublin and Cork. They were assisted by divisions among their opponents, with some areas held by forces loyal to Parliament, others by the Royalist Duke of Ormonde and the Covenanters pursuing their own agenda around Carrickfergus. The reality was an extremely complex mix of shifting loyalties; for various reasons, many Ulster Protestants regarded the Scots with hostility, as did some of their nominal allies in Parliament, including Cromwell.

===Stalemate===

The Civil War gave the Confederates time to create regular, full-time armies and they were eventually able to support some 60,000 men in different areas. These were funded by an extensive system of taxation, equipped with supplies from France, Spain and the Papacy and led by Irish professionals like Thomas Preston and Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, who had served in the Spanish army.

However, they arguably squandered an opportunity to conquer all of Ireland by signing a truce or &quot;Cessation of Arms&quot; with the Royalists on 15 September 1643, then spending the next three years in abortive negotiations. The period 1642 to 1646 was dominated by raids, with all sides attempting to starve their enemies by the destruction of crops and supplies, causing great loss of life, particularly among civilians. The bitterness it engendered is illustrated by a Parliamentary Ordinance of October 1644, which forbade &#x27;giving of quarter to any Irishman or Papist born in Ireland who shall be taken in Hostility against the Parliament either upon the Sea or in England and Wales.&#x27;

An offensive against Ulster in 1644 failed to make significant progress, while defeat at Marston Moor in July made it increasingly clear the English Royalists were losing the war; two weeks later, the Earl of Inchiquin defected to Parliament, giving them control of the ports of Cork, Kinsale and Youghal. In late 1644, the Confederates took Bandon but Inchiquin retained control of Cork; Preston captured Duncannon in January 1645, then besieged Youghal but lack of supplies forced him to abandon the siege in March 1645.

===Refugees===
The opening years of the war saw widespread displacement of civilians – both sides practising what would now be called ethnic cleansing. In the initial phase of the rebellion in 1641, the vulnerable Protestant settler population fled to walled towns such as Dublin, Cork and Derry for protection. Others fled to England. When Ulster was occupied by Scottish Covenanter troops in 1642, they retaliated for the attacks on settlers by attacks on the Irish Catholic civilian population. As a result, it has been estimated that up to 30,000 people fled Ulster in 1642, to live in Confederate held territory. Many of them became camp followers of Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Ulster Army, living in clan-based groupings called &quot;creaghts&quot; and driving their herds of cattle around with the army. Outside of Ulster, the treatment of civilians was less harsh, although the &quot;no-mans-land&quot; in between Confederate and British held territory in Leinster and Munster was repeatedly raided and burned, with the result that it too became de-populated.

===Victory and defeat for the Confederates===

The stalemate, however, broke in 1646. During the summer after the end of the First English Civil War, the Confederate military tried to make as many gains in Ireland as they could before the expected invasion by the forces of the English Parliament. In that effort they were quite successful. On 5 June 1646, Owen O&#x27;Neill defeated a Parliamentary and Scottish army commanded by Robert Munro at Benburb. During July, Thomas Preston leading the Leinster Army of the Confederates captured the Parliamentary stronghold at Roscommon while Donough McCarthy Viscount Muskerry captured the castle of Bunratty.

On 30 July, however, it was proclaimed in Dublin by the Royalists that the Confederate Supreme Council had signed a peace treaty on 28 March 1646 with King Charles as represented by Ormonde. The treaty was signed unbeknownst to the Confederate military commanders and without the participation of the leader of the Catholic clergy, Rinuccini, who had arrived in Ireland with money and arms as the Papal Nuncio nine months earlier.

Many provisions of the treaty were unacceptable to Rinuccini and the Confederate military commanders, especially sending military support to Royalists in England for a cause that was seemingly ended with the conclusion of the civil war. Rinuccini and the Confederate military commanders also believed that there might be a chance for them to defeat the English in Ireland and take total control given the magnitude of their recent victories. As so, Rinuccini publicly denounced the Ormonde treaty on 12 August. Rinuccini and the Confederate military then marched upon Kilkenny, declared the Ormonde treaty void, and create a new Confederate Supreme Council.

Trying next to take control of Ireland, the Confederate armies commanded by O&#x27;Neill and Preston attempted to capture Dublin, Ormonde&#x27;s Royalist garrison by siege. Their plan to seize Dublin failed, however, as the Royalists had devastated the land around their capital and the Confederate commanders were unable to feed their armies. The inability to capture Dublin was an embarrassment to Rinuccini and the Confederates as it exposed the folly of their strategy of conquesting Ireland. Ormonde then turned to negotiations with the English Parliament and ultimately handed the city over to a Parliamentarian army commanded by Colonel Michael Jones on 19 June 1647.

In 1647, the Parliamentarian forces inflicted a shattering series of defeats on the Confederates, ultimately forcing them to join a Royalist coalition to try to hold off a Parliamentarian invasion. Firstly, in August 1647, when it tried to march on Dublin, Thomas Preston&#x27;s Leinster army was annihilated at the battle of Dungans Hill by Jones&#x27; Parliamentarian army. This was the best trained and best equipped Confederate army and the loss of its manpower and equipment was a body blow to the Confederation. Secondly, the Parliamentarians based in Cork devastated the Confederates&#x27; territory in Munster, provoking famine among the civilian population. In September, they stormed Cashel, not only taking the town but also massacring its garrison and inhabitants, including several Catholic clerics. When the Irish Munster army brought them to battle at Knocknanauss in November, they too were crushed. Sligo also changed hands again – captured by the Ulster British settlers&#x27; army. The battles in this phase of the war were exceptionally bloody: in the battles of 1646–47, the losers had up to half of those engaged killed – most commonly in the rout after the battle was decided. In the three largest engagements of 1647, no less than 1% of the Irish male population (around 7,000–8,000 men) were killed in battle.

This string of defeats forced the Confederates to come to a deal with the Royalists, and to put their troops under their command. Amid factional fighting within their ranks over this deal, the Confederates dissolved their association in 1648 and accepted Ormonde as the commander in chief of the Royalist coalition in Ireland. Inchiquin, the Parliamentarian commander in Cork, also defected to the Royalists after the arrest of King Charles I.

The Confederates were fatally divided over this compromise. Rinuccini, the Papal Nuncio, threatened to excommunicate anyone who accepted the deal. Particularly galling for him was the alliance with Inchiquin, who had massacred Catholic civilians and clergy in Munster in 1647. There was even a brief period of civil war in 1648 between Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Ulster Army, as he refused to accept the Royalist alliance, and the new Royalist–Confederate coalition. O&#x27;Neill neglected to secure adequate supplies and was unable to force a change in policy on his former comrades. During this divisive period the Confederates missed a second strategic chance to reorganise while their opponents were engaged in the Second English Civil War (1648–49), which was lost by their royalist allies.

==The Cromwellian War, 1649–1653==
The Confederate/Royalist coalition wasted valuable months fighting with Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill and other former Confederates instead of preparing to resist the impending Parliamentarian invasion of Ireland. O&#x27;Neill later re-joined the Confederate side. Belatedly, in summer 1649, Ormonde tried to take Dublin from the Parliamentarians, and was routed by Michael Jones at the battle of Rathmines.

Oliver Cromwell landed shortly afterwards with the New Model Army. Whereas the Confederates had failed to defeat their enemies in eight years of fighting, Cromwell was able to succeed in three years in conquering the entire island of Ireland, because his troops were well supplied, well equipped (especially with artillery), and well trained. Moreover, he had a huge supply of men, money and logistics to fund the campaign.

===The Cromwellian Conquest===
His first action was to secure the east coast of Ireland for supplies of men and logistics from England. To this end, he took Drogheda and Wexford, perpetrating massacres of the defenders of both towns. He also sent a force to the north to link up with the British settler army there. Those settlers who supported the Scots and Royalists were defeated by the Parliamentarians at the battle of Lisnagarvey.

Ormonde signally failed to mount a military defence of southern Ireland. He based his defences upon walled towns, which Cromwell systematically took one after the other with his ample supply of siege artillery. The Irish and Royalist field armies did not hold any strategic line of defence and instead were demoralised by a constant stream of defeats and withdrawals. Only at the siege of Clonmel did Cromwell suffer significant casualties (although disease also took a very heavy toll on his men). His losses were made good by the defection of the Royalist garrison of Cork, who had been Parliamentarians up to 1648, back to the Parliament side. Cromwell returned to England in 1650, passing his command to Henry Ireton.

In the north, the Parliamentarian/settler army met the Irish Ulster army at the battle of Scarrifholis and destroyed it. Ormonde was discredited and fled for France, to be replaced by Ulick Burke, Earl of Clanricarde. By 1651, the remaining Royalist/Irish forces were hemmed into an area west of the River Shannon, holding only the fortified cities of Limerick and Galway and an enclave in County Kerry, under Donagh MacCarthy, Viscount Muskerry.

Ireton besieged Limerick while the northern Parliamentarian army under Charles Coote besieged Galway. Muskerry made an attempt to relieve Limerick, marching north from Kerry, and was routed by Roger Boyle at the battle of Knocknaclashy. Limerick and Galway were too well defended to be taken by storm, and were blockaded until hunger and disease forced them to surrender, Limerick in 1651, Galway in 1652. Waterford and Duncannon also surrendered in 1651.

===Guerrilla War===

While formal resistance ended, the harsh surrender terms resulted in a period of guerrilla warfare by bands of former soldiers, known as Tóraidhe or &#x27;Tories.&#x27; These operated from rugged areas such as the Wicklow Mountains, looting supplies and attacking Parliamentary patrols, who responded with forced evictions and the destruction of crops. The result was widespread famine, aggravated by an outbreak of bubonic plague.

The last organised Irish force surrendered in Cavan in April 1653 and given passage to France to either serve in the French army or with the English Royalist Court in exile. Those captured after this point were executed or transported to penal colonies in the West Indies.

Ireland was plagued with small scale violence for the remainder of the 1650s, partly due to the 1652 Act for the Settlement of Ireland. This created a class of landless former farmers and dramatically altered patterns of Irish land holding, the percentage owned by Protestants increasing from 41% to 78% over the period 1641 to 1660.

==Shifting allegiances==
The Irish Confederate Wars were a complex conflict in which no fewer than four major armies fought in Ireland. These were the Royalists loyal to King Charles, the Scottish Covenanters (sent into Ulster in 1642 to protect Protestant planters after the massacres that marked the Irish rebellion of 1641 in that region), the Parliamentarian army, and the Irish Confederate army to whom most of the inhabitants of Ireland gave their allegiance. During the wars, all of these forces came into conflict at one stage or another. To add to the turmoil, a brief civil war was fought between Irish Confederate factions in 1648.

The Royalists under Ormonde were in conflict with Irish Catholic forces from late 1641 to 1643. Their main enclave was in Dublin. A ceasefire with the Confederate Catholics lasted from 1643 until 1646, when the Confederates again came into conflict with the Royalists. After 1648 most of the Confederates and the Scots joined an alliance with the Royalists. This was the array of forces that was to face Cromwell&#x27;s army in 1649. Ormonde&#x27;s handling of the defence of Ireland was however rather inept so that by mid-1650 the defence of Ireland was conducted mainly by Irish Confederate leaders.

The Irish Confederates: formed in October 1642, the Confederation of Kilkenny was initially a rebel Irish Catholic movement, fighting against the English troops sent to put down the rebellion, though they insisted they were at war with the king&#x27;s advisers and not with Charles himself. They also had to fight the Scottish army that landed in Ulster. From 1642 to 1649, the Confederates controlled most of Ireland except for east and west Ulster, Cork city and Dublin. A cessation was arranged with the Royalists in 1643 after the outbreak of civil war in England and negotiations began to bring the Confederates into the English conflict on the Royalist side. A strongly Catholic faction under the influence of the Irish Bishops and Nuncio Rinuccini emerged in 1646, which opposed signing a peace treaty that did not recognise the position of the Catholic Church in Ireland or return confiscated Catholic land. When this faction ousted the Confederate &#x27;peace party&#x27; or pro-Royalists, the Confederates once again clashed with the English Royalists, who abandoned most of their positions in Ireland to the Parliamentarians during 1646. However, after fresh negotiations, an alliance was arranged between the Royalists and Confederates in 1648. Some Confederates (most notably the Ulster army) were however opposed to this treaty initiating a brief Irish Catholic civil war in 1648 in which the Ulster Confederate army was supported by the English Parliament.

The Scottish Covenanters arrived in Ireland in early 1642 to put down the uprising and thereby protect the lives and property of the Scottish Protestant settlers in Ulster. They held most of eastern Ulster for the duration of the war, but were badly weakened by their defeat by the Confederates at the battle of Benburb in 1646. They fought the Confederates (with the support of the English Parliament) from their arrival in Ulster in 1642 until 1648. After the English Parliament and the Scottish Covenanters&#x27; alliance broke down, the Scottish forces in Ulster joined the Confederates and Royalists in an alliance against their former allies in 1649.

The Parliamentarian Army gained a major foothold in Ireland for the first time in 1644, when Inchiquin&#x27;s Cork-based Protestant force fell out with the Royalists over their ceasefire with the Confederates. The Protestant settler forces in the north west of Ireland, known as the Laggan Army (or Laggan Force), also came over to the Parliamentarians after 1644, deeming them to be the most reliably anti-Catholic of the English forces. The city of Dublin fell into Parliamentarian hands in 1646, when the Royalists surrendered it to an English Parliamentarian expeditionary force after the city was threatened by Confederate armies. In 1648 the Parliamentarians briefly gave support to Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Ulstermen after his fall out with the Confederates: Thus the extreme Catholic and Puritan forces were briefly allied for mutual expediency. The Ulster Catholic army however joined the Confederate-Royalist alliance after the shock of Cromwell&#x27;s invasion in August 1649. The most potent Parliamentarian force was the New Model Army, which proceeded to conquer Ireland over the next four years and to enforce the Adventurers&#x27; Act 1640 by conquering and selling Irish land to pay off its financial backers.

==Aftermath==
The toll of the conflict was huge. Irish historian William Lecky wrote:Hardly any page in human history is more appalling. A full third of the population of Ireland perished. Thirty or forty thousand of the most energetic left the country and took service in foreign armies. Great tracts were left absolutely depopulated...William Petty, a Cromwellian who conducted the first scientific land and demographic survey of Ireland in the 1650s (the Down Survey), concluded that at least 400,000 people and maybe as many as 620,000 had died in Ireland between 1641 and 1653. The true figure may well be lower given Petty&#x27;s outmoded methodology, but the lowest suggested is about 200,000. At the time, according to William Petty, the population of Ireland was only around 1.5 million inhabitants. It is estimated that about two-thirds of the deaths were civilian. The Irish defeat led to the mass confiscation of Catholic owned land and the English Protestant domination of Ireland for over two centuries.

The wars, especially the Cromwellian conquest, were long remembered in Irish culture. Gaelic and Irish poetry of the post-war era laments lack of unity among Irish Catholics in the Confederation and their constant infighting, which was blamed for their failure to resist Cromwell. Other common themes include the mourning of the old Irish Catholic landed classes, which were destroyed in the wars, and the cruelty of the Parliamentarian forces.

<text>The Lviv Automobile Factory (), mostly known under its obsolete name &quot;Lvivskyi Avtobusnyi Zavod&quot; (, literally &quot;Lviv Bus Factory&quot;) was a bus manufacturing company in Lviv, Ukraine. Their brand-name is LAZ (ЛАЗ), and the company and its products are often referred to with this acronym rather than the full name.

It was one of the major bus manufacturers in the Soviet Union and the largest-ever industrial company in the city of Lviv. The factory was held by a private holding company.

==History==
The Lviv Bus Plant LAZ was built in 1945 to produce ZIS buses for the USSR. The LAZ 695 bus was designed and approved by the Moscow Ministry of Transport. Production began in 1956 and continued until 2006.

During the 1970s many new models were developed such as the LAZ 699, and 697 both of which are coach buses. In 1967, LAZ was awarded the best bus producer in Europe at the Brussels Auto Show. LAZ is known to be the first company to create the low floor bus, which came in 1963, was called the LAZ 360, and was designed by Nami USSR.

After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, LAZ suffered economic issues due to the loss of funding. Production was halted due to low demand. After Ukraine&#x27;s economy started to stabilize, LAZ began producing their newer model, the LAZ 52523.

In 2001, LAZ was sold to Russian business tycoon Igor Churkin, and a new business model was implemented. The whole line of production was re-engineered to produce new buses for a lower cost. LAZ used a system called a &quot;flexible assembly line&quot;, which gave the ability to produce a variety of different models simultaneously. Additionally, LAZ buses were hand assembled.

Some of their most widely known products included the LAZ-695 city bus and its stretch, tourist-oriented version, the LAZ-699. ElectroLAZ, the LAZ trolleybus, was used by over 25 cities around the world.

LAZ provided transportation for the UEFA Euro 2012 championship held in Ukraine and Poland in 2012. The Ukrainian government signed a contract to purchase 2500 new &quot;CityLAZ&quot;, with a possibility of 800 more. After the championship, LAZ buses were used as regular city transportation in the cities hosting EURO 2012. In 2012, three new models were introduced: The LAZ 695 Soyuz, the LAZ 4207 DM, and the LAZ A183 CNG.

==Facilities==
LAZ Holding had two factories located in Ukraine: LAZ and DAZ

LAZ headquarters and factory were in Lviv, Ukraine. This consisted of over 300 buildings. It was equipped with its own water pumping system, power transforming plant, gas filtration system, water cleaning and discharging system, machinery cooling system, centralized compressed air, fire house, police team, internal telephone/PA system, press building, laser cutting shop, chroming shop, metalworking shop, painting center, design bureau and a marketing center.

DAZ&#x27;s headquarters consisted of 20 large buildings located in Kamianske. The DAZ factory plant had a large assembly hall, central compressed air system, welding and painting machinery and a testing center.

The central office for LAZ Holding was headquartered in Kyiv city center, Ukraine.

LAZ Holding consists of a few companies.

<doc id="744061" wikidata="Q707774" url="?curid=744061" title="Coronary thrombosis">
<text>Coronary thrombosis is defined as the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel of the heart. This blood clot may then restrict blood flow within the heart, leading to heart tissue damage, or a myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack.

Coronary thrombosis is most commonly caused as a downstream effect of atherosclerosis, a buildup of cholesterol and fats in the artery walls. The smaller vessel diameter allows less blood to flow and facilitates progression to a myocardial infarction. Leading risk factors for coronary thrombosis are high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and hypertension.

Symptoms of coronary thrombosis are not always evident at the start. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and discomfort in the upper body.

A coronary thrombosis is a medical emergency (life threatening) and requires urgent care at a hospital.

==Signs and symptoms==
A coronary thrombus is asymptomatic until it causes significant obstruction, leading to various forms of angina or eventually a myocardial infarction. Common warning symptoms are crushing chest pain, shortness of breath, and upper body discomfort.

== Pathogenesis ==
Coronary thrombosis and myocardial infarction are sometimes used as synonyms, although this is technically inaccurate as the thrombosis refers to the blocking of blood vessels with a thrombus, while myocardial infarction refers to heart tissue death due to the consequent loss of blood flow to the heart. Due to extensive collateral circulation, a coronary thrombus does not necessarily cause tissue death and may be asymptomatic.

The formation of coronary thrombosis generally follows the same mechanism as other blood clots in the body, the coagulation cascade. Also applicable is the Virchow&#x27;s triad of blood stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulable state. Atherosclerosis contributes to coronary thrombosis formation by facilitating blood stasis as well as causing local endothelial injury.

Due to the large number of cases of myocardial infarction leading to death and disease in the world, there has been extensive study towards the generation of clots specifically in the coronary arteries. Some areas of focus:
* Coronary thrombosis can be a complication associated with drug-eluting stents. These stents that are placed to open up narrowed arteries are often infused with medicine to prevent repeat stenosis. However, they may actually lead to an increased coronary thrombus formation due to increased tissue factor expression and delayed healing within the vessels. Furthermore, the downstream endothelium has been shown to be impaired, leading to an environment that favors formation of clots. Evidence remains inconclusive about whether these risks outweigh the benefit of a coronary arterial stent.
* Inflammation may play a causal role in coronary artery disease and subsequent myocardial infarction due to coronary thrombosis. Increased levels of inflammation may lead to higher risk of clotting as well as an increased risk of stent/device subsequent thrombosis. There is an ongoing search for inflammatory biomarkers that can help determine at-risk individuals.
* Coronary &quot;microembolization&quot; is being explored as a focal point for coronary thrombus formation and subsequent sudden death due to acute myocardial infarction.
* High mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) proteins as important mediators in thrombus formation.
* Coronary sinus thrombosis as a severe complication after procedures. The coronary sinus is the venous counterpart to the coronary arteries, where de-oxygenated blood returns from heart tissue. A large thrombus here slows overall blood circulation to heart tissue as well as may mechanically compress a coronary artery.

== Diagnosis ==
Clinical signs of myocardial infarction (heart attack) or angina if coronary thrombus is symptomatic:
Imaging modalities used to evaluate the presence of coronary thrombi:
* angioscopy
* endocoronary ultrasound
* coronary angiography
* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Postmortem examiners may look for Lines of Zahn, to determine whether blood clotted in the heart vessels before or after death.

== Management ==
Management of symptomatic coronary thrombosis follows established treatment algorithms for myocardial infarction. Treatment options include:
* emergency coronary artery bypass grafting
* stent implantation
* intracoronary thrombolysis
* anticoagulation with heparin or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors
* thrombus aspiration as reperfusion strategy
* platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitors: a study published in 2001 determined that the addition of clopidogrel showed a positive effect on cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal heart attack, and stroke at the cost of an increased risk of major bleeding.

To address the possibility of identifying and treating asymptomatic coronary artery disease to prevent development of coronary thrombosis, a study published 2018 determined that preemptive treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention did not lead to a difference in death or myocardial infarction over a 15-year period.

There are numerous treatments currently being studied for management and prevention of coronary thrombosis. Statin drugs, in addition to their primary cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of action, have been studied to target a number of pathways that may decrease coronary inflammation and subsequent thrombosis.

Another realm of potential treatments in early stages of adoption is in therapeutic use of contrast ultrasound on thrombus dissolution.

==Notable people==
== Terminology ==
Thrombosis is defined as the formation of a thrombus (blood clot) inside a blood vessel, leading to obstruction of blood flow within the circulatory system. Coronary thrombosis refers to the formation and presence of thrombi in the coronary arteries of the heart. The heart does not contain veins, but rather coronary sinuses that serve the purpose of returning de-oxygenated blood from the heart muscle.

A thrombus is a type of embolism, a more general term for any material that partially or fully blocks a blood vessel. An atheroembolism, or cholesterol embolism, is when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures and becomes an embolism. Atherosclerosis is the progressive thickening of blood vessels and plaque formation that eventually can lead to coronary artery disease.

<text>Czarni Słupsk, more commonly known as Icon Sea Czarni Słupsk because of sponsorship reasons, is a Polish basketball team, based in Słupsk, playing in Polish Basketball League (PLK). The home arena of the club was Hala Gryfia.

==History==
In July 1945, the original Czarni Słupsk team was formed, by railway workers who moved from Kraków to Słupsk after World War II. The club was originated as an association football club, but in 1989 the basketball section was founded. In the 1998–99 season, the team promoted to the Polish Basketball League (PLK). In the 2005–06 season, the first club honour was one: the bronze medal. In the 2010s Czarni Słupsk was a steady competitor in the PLK, with several Playoff appearances.

On 31 January 2018, Czarni Słupsk retired from the league and was dissolved due to financial collapse.

In 2018, it was decided to re-start basketball activities for the club and before 2021–22 season, they promoted to PLK, first-tier of Polish basketball system.

<doc id="744073" wikidata="Q7330264" url="?curid=744073" title="Richard Martyn (Mayor of Galway)">
<text>Richard Óge Martyn (c. 1602 – 1648) was a Galway lawyer and member of the Catholic Confederates of Ireland. He was of the senior line of the Martyn family, one of the Tribes of Galway. He lived at Dunguaire Castle, Kinvarra. He worked with his brother-in-law and first cousin, Patrick D&#x27;Arcy, against the Plantation of Connaught in the 1630s, and served on the Supreme Council of the Confederate Catholics in the 1640s. 

Martyn also served as Mayor of Galway, 1642–1643. He and D&#x27;Arcy were part of a network of Catholic lawyers in Galway who contrived to continue in practice in defiance of the Penal Laws, which barred Catholics from the professions. Richard was admitted to the King&#x27;s Inns in 1631: he was suspended from practice at the Irish Bar in 1635 as a known Catholic, but permitted to resume practice in 1637, apparently because he had sworn the Oath of Supremacy.

Friends and acquaintances included John Lynch, Mary Bonaventure Browne, and Sir Dermott Ó Seachnasaigh. His contemporaries included Mícheál Ó Cléirigh and Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim.

==1641 Depositions==

Martyn is mentioned in several of the 1641 Depositions concerning the events in Galway from early 1642 to summer 1643, in which he took a leading part:

* William Hamond – &quot;
* Joseph Hampton – &#x27; (including) Richard Martin, &#x27;
* William Lincoln – &quot;
* Thomas Bagworth – &quot;
* Andrew Darcy – &quot;

Among the most damming depositions are those given by John Turner:

==Family and descendants==

He was survived by his wife, Magdalene French, and five surviving children, Oliver Óge Martyn, Peter Martyn, John, Patrick and Magdalene, and his father Oliver Mór Martyn. He is an ancestor of both the first president of Sinn Féin, Edward Martyn (1859–1923), and the leader of the Irish Unionist Alliance and Ulster Unionist Party Edward Carson, Baron Carson (1854–1935).

A later descendant was the Hungarian artist, Ferenc Martyn (1899–1986).

He was a kinsman to Richard Martin (1754–1834), who was likewise an Irish nationalist.

<text>Start Lublin, officially Polski Cukier Pszczółka Start Lublin for sponsporship reasons, is a Polish basketball club based in Lublin. The team plays in the Polish Basketball League (PLK) since 2014. Its home arena is the Globus, which has places for 5,000 people. The basketball team is a part of MKS Start Lublin, which also holds chess and athletics sections.

==History==
MKS Start Lublin was founded in 1953, along with the basketball team. After seven years of existence, Start promoted to the Polish Basketball League (PLK), the national highest league. In the 1964–65 season, Start captured its first bronze medal. In 1978, Start was the first Polish club to sign an African-American played in Kent Washington. Washington was named PLK Most Valuable Player in 1980.

In the 2002–03 season, Start returned to the PLK after winning the First Division. After two years, the team relegated once again. 

In the summer of 2014, Start Lublin received a wild card from the PLK because of the expansion from 12 to 16 teams.

Lublin had its most successful season in the 2019–20 PLK season, which was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When the season was ended, the team was in second place with a 17–5 record. As such, it qualified for a European competition for the first time in the 2020–21 Basketball Champions League.

<doc id="744081" wikidata="Q2878056" url="?curid=744081" title="Frosted glass">
<text>Frosted glass is produced by the sandblasting or acid etching of clear sheet glass. This creates a pitted surface on one side of the glass pane and has the effect of rendering the glass translucent by scattering the light which passes through, thus blurring images while still transmitting light. It has 10–20% opacity.

General applications include:

* To achieve visual privacy while still allowing light to pass through.
* To create decorative patterns on plain glass by using wax or other inhibitors to retain transparent areas. 
* To distribute light uniformly in a photographic contact printer.
* To create an airtight seal in tubes.
* Decorative, aesthetic, or artistic intent.

The frosted glass effect can also be achieved by the application of vinyl film, used as a sort of stencil on the glass surface. &quot;Photo-resist&quot;, or photo-resistant film is also available, which can be produced to mask off the area surrounding a decorative design, or logo on the glass surface. A similar effect may also be accomplished with the use of canned frosted glass sprays.

== Recycling issue ==

As a rule, frosted glass is not suitable for recycling through glass bins. This is because the etchants used to produce some frosted glass can leave chemical residue, which can interfere with the recycling process and spoil a whole batch. Frosted glass that was not acid-etched but rather produced by sandblasting is recyclable in principle, however, since it can be hard to tell how a given piece of frosted glass was manufactured, most recyclers will reject frosted glass absent a contract with specific assurances.

<doc id="744084" wikidata="Q1152106" url="?curid=744084" title="French aircraft carrier PA2">
<text>PA2 (, &quot;Aircraft Carrier 2&quot;) was a planned aircraft carrier under development by Thales Naval France and DCNS for the French Navy. The design was based on the aircraft carriers developed for the Royal Navy. The project was cancelled in the 2013 French White Paper on Defence and National Security.

==Background==
The previous French carriers, and , were completed in 1961 and 1963 respectively. The requirement for a replacement was identified in the mid-1970s, which became the 40,600 tonne nuclear-powered , laid down in April 1989 at the DCNS Brest naval shipyard. This carrier was launched in May 1994, but not officially commissioned until 2001 due to a large number of problems, which included the need to lengthen the flight deck after aircraft trials, a broken propeller and vibration and noise problems. The French Navy was understood to be unwilling to proceed with another carrier of the same design and by 2003 the possibility of sharing the Royal Navy design emerged to fulfill the French requirement for a second carrier.

The requirement for the carriers was confirmed by Jacques Chirac in 2004 for the centennial of the Entente Cordiale and on 26 January 2006 the defence ministers of France and Britain reached an agreement regarding cooperation on the design of their future carriers. France agreed to pay the UK for access to the design due to the investment made to date. These payments were £30 million in January 2006, £25 million in July 2006 and a further £45 million if France decides to proceed with the project.

The FY2008 French defence budget included the necessary funding, €3 billion, for the ship. However, in April 2008 French Defence Minister Herve Morin cast doubt over plans for a second aircraft carrier, citing a cash crunch and the fact that rising oil prices put the question of the propulsion back on the table, and said a decision would be taken soon. Further doubts were cast on the project on 21 June 2008 when then French President Nicolas Sarkozy decided to suspend co-operation with Britain on the aircraft carrier. Sarkozy stated that a final decision on France building a second carrier would be taken by 2012.

British plans for two aircraft carriers went ahead as planned despite the French withdrawal, as the original project had in any case been a British one and not dependent on French involvement.

On 3 February 2009, the French government ordered studies about another architecture and design casting even more doubt on the likelihood of the French Navy using the current British design. The option of nuclear propulsion was also put back on the table, and if selected would have required a completely different approach. An option similar to the Azimuth thruster used on the ships was also considered.

==Design considerations==

The French carrier would have been built by an alliance of Thales and DCNS using the proposed design of a long, 75,000 tonne variant of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class. While the UK had chosen to continue to use STOVL configuration for its new carriers, the design could also be reconfigured to a CATOBAR configuration for French requirements. The French variant would have most likely operated the Dassault Rafale, the E-2C Hawkeye and the NH-90 fixed-wing and rotary aircraft. Being a CATOBAR design, PA2 would have been equipped with the same long C13-2 steam catapults as those installed on the aircraft carriers of the United States Navy.

The crew of PA2 was expected to be about 1,650, a significant decrease from the 1,950 crew of &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, indicating the high level of automation integrated into the ship&#x27;s systems.

The ship would have had two islands: one devoted to ship navigation, and the other to air operations. Allowing optimal placement of bridges for both tasks; navigation calls for a bridge placed forward (as on &quot;Charles De Gaulle&quot;), while air operations are made easier with a bridge placed aft (as seen on the US &quot;Nimitz&quot; class).

The original design had to meet the Royal Navy&#x27;s requirements, so nuclear propulsion was not an option: the British government rejected nuclear propulsion as too costly. Before cancellation the carrier&#x27;s propulsion system was expected to be an integrated full electric propulsion (IFEP) based on two Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbines. The carrier would have had a range of approximately .

==Construction considerations==
The hull was likely to be built by Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique at Saint Nazaire, and fitted out by DCN at Brest. The ship was likely to be based at Toulon naval base whose two dry docks can accommodate even the larger &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carriers.

==Name considerations==
At the time, it had been proposed to name the aircraft carrier &quot;Richelieu&quot;, after Cardinal Richelieu, which was the name originally intended for &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;.

<text>The Bulgarian [[Saint Stephen|St. Stephen]] Church (; ), also known as the Bulgarian Iron Church, is a Bulgarian Orthodox church in Balat, Istanbul, Turkey. It is famous for being made of prefabricated cast iron elements in the Neo-Byzantine style. The church belongs to the Bulgarian Christian minority in the city.

== History ==
The Bulgarian Orthodox Christians of the Ottoman Empire used to pray at the churches of the Phanar Orthodox Patriarchate, as they were part of the Rum Millet—that is, the Orthodox Christian community of the Ottoman Empire—but the Bulgarian nationalist movement of the 19th century advocated the creation of a separate Bulgarian ecclesiastical organization for Bulgarian Orthodox Christians, as they considered the Phanar Patriarchate a predominantly Greek Orthodox institution. These efforts culminated in the recognition of the Bulgarian Exarchate through a firman issued by the Ottoman sultan Abdülaziz in 1870.

The richly ornamented church is a three-domed cross-shaped basilica. The altar faces the Golden Horn and a 40 m-high belfry, the six bells of which were cast in Yaroslavl, rises above the narthex. Initially, a small wooden church was erected on the shore of the Golden Horn between Balat and Fener squares (near Eyüp District), where the current church is located. A house was donated by the statesman Stefan Bogoridi, and it was reorganized as a wooden church. It was inaugurated on 9 October 1849 and became an important site of the Bulgarian National Revival. The Ottoman royal decree of 28 February 1870 establishing the Bulgarian Exarchate was first read in the church.

After the original wooden structure suffered from a fire, the larger current building was constructed at its place. An iron frame was preferred to concrete reinforcement because of the weak ground conditions. The construction plans were prepared by the Istanbul-based Ottoman Armenian architect Hovsep Aznavur.

An international competition was conducted to produce the prefabricated cast iron parts of the church, won by an Austrian company, R. Ph. Waagner. The prefabricated elements, weighing 500 tons, were produced in Vienna in 1893 to 1896 and transported to Istanbul by ship through the Danube and the Black Sea.

After one-and-a-half years, the church was completed in 1898 and inaugurated by Exarch Joseph on 8 September that year. The main skeleton of the church was made of steel and covered by metal boards. All the pieces were attached together with nuts, bolts, rivets or welding. In terms of architectural style, the church combines Neo-Byzantine and Neo-Baroque influences.

St. Stephen was the product of 19th-century experimentation with prefabricated iron churches. The British, who invented the corrugated iron in 1829, manufactured portable iron churches to send to far-flung colonies like Australia. The Eiffel Tower&#x27;s creator, French engineer Gustave Eiffel, designed iron churches that were sent as far as the Philippines and Peru. Now, St. Stephen is one of the world&#x27;s few surviving prefabricated cast iron churches.

On December 27, 2010, St. Stephen&#x27;s feast day, a celebratory Mass was held at the church in honor of its patron saint. Attending were the Vratsa Metropolitan Kalinik, bishop Naum, Chief Secretary of the Bulgarian Holy Synod, and representatives of the &quot;St. Stephen Church&quot; Foundation. Honoring the celebration the dome of the church was gold-plated using funds donated by the Bulgarians of Plovdiv.

The church building underwent a renovation, which started under the Bulgarian-Turkish cooperation in 2011 and cost more than 15 million. On January 8, 2018, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov were present at the inauguration of the renovated St. Stephen&#x27;s Orthodox Church in Istanbul, on the occasion of its 120th anniversary.

In addition to the St. Stephen Church, there is another Bulgarian Orthodox church in Istanbul, St. Demetrius Church, in Feriköy.

<text>149 Medusa is a bright-coloured, stony main-belt asteroid that was discovered by French astronomer J. Perrotin on September 21, 1875, and named after the Gorgon Medusa, a snake-haired monster in Greek mythology. It is orbiting the Sun at a distance of with a period of and an eccentricity of 0.065. The orbital plane is tilted slightly at an angle of 0.94° to the plane of the ecliptic.

When it was discovered, Medusa was by far the smallest asteroid found (although this was not known at that time). Since then, many thousands of smaller asteroids have been found. It was also the closest asteroid to the Sun discovered up to that point, beating the long-held record of 8 Flora. It remained the closest asteroid to the Sun until 433 Eros and 434 Hungaria were found in 1898, leading to the discovery of two new families of asteroids inward from the 4:1 Kirkwood gap which forms the boundary of the main belt.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico, during 2010 gave a light curve with a rather long rotation period of 26.038 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.56 ± 0.03 in magnitude.

<text>Turów Zgorzelec (officially PGE GiEK Turów Zgorzelec for sponsorship reasons) is a Polish a basketball team based in Zgorzelec. 

The club played in the Polish League (PLK) and won the Polish championship once, in the 2013–14 season. The club was sponsored by the PGE Group, and they are also the club&#x27;s name sponsor as well but in 2018, the club withdrew after the PGE Group pulled back their sponsoring. The club continues to play in the lower leagues.

The club&#x27;s home court for domestic Polish League games is the Turów Arena.

==History==

The original athletic club was founded in 1948, as an athletic association with a football club in Bogatynia, called KS Miner Turoszów. In 1961, the club changed its name to Sports Club Turów. In June 1964, the athletic club added a sailing team. Then also in 1964, the athletic club formed the men&#x27;s basketball section. Then in 1965, the club moved from Bogatynia to Zgorzelec.

The club was promoted to the Polish Premier League in 1978. After one season in the top division, Turów played in the lower Polish leagues for 25 years. The club won the Polish second division title in 2004, and was them promoted to up to the Polish first division once again.

In 2006, the basketball section took the name of KKS Turów Zgorzelec S.A, and the sailing club became a separate sports association called Sports Club Turów Zgorzelec. In 2007, the club reached a sponsorship agreement with PGE Group, and thus the club&#x27;s name sponsor has been PGE Turów Zgorzelec since then.

Between 2007 and 2013, the club had 5 Polish League Finals appearances in the Tauron Basket Liga. However, the team lost in each of those finals appearances against Prokom Trefl Sopot / Asseco Prokom Gdynia.
In 2014, Turów won the Tauron Basket Liga championship, after they defeated Zielona Góra in the Finals 4–2. J.P. Prince led the team the whole season, and was rewarded with the PLK Most Valuable Player award. The 34-year-old veteran Filip Dylewicz was chosen as the 2014 PLK Finals MVP.

To add to the positive developments around the club, the team qualified for the 2014–15 Euroleague season. It would be the first appearance of the club on this level, and Turów is just the fourth Polish club to ever play in the Euroleague.

In July 2018, Turów withdrew from the PLK after PGE Group stopped financing the club. The club since restarted from the lowest, Third Division.

==Arenas==

Turów Zgorzelec played its domestic Polish League home games at the 1,500 seat capacity Centrum Sportowe. For European cup games, which require arenas with larger seating capacities, like the Eurocup (3,000 seating minimum requirement) and the Euroleague (5,000 seating minimum requirement), the club could play its home games at either the 6,080 seat CRS Hala Zielona Góra or the 9,000 seat Tipsport Arena.

In 2014, Turów opened the PGE Turów Arena, its new home court with a capacity for 3,500 people.
