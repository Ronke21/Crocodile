<text>Porky Pig is a cartoon character in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons. He was the first character created by the studio to draw audiences based on his star power, and the animators created many critically acclaimed shorts featuring the character. Even after he was supplanted by later characters, Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and, more importantly, the Warners directors, who recast him in numerous everyman and sidekick roles.

He is known for his signature line at the end of many shorts, &quot;(stutter) that&#x27;s all, folks!&quot; This slogan (without stuttering) had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy and even Beans at the end of Looney Tunes cartoons. Porky is the oldest continuing Looney Tunes character.

Porky&#x27;s most distinctive trait is a severe stutter, for which he sometimes compensates by replacing his words; for example, &quot;What&#x27;s going on?&quot; might become &quot;What&#x27;s guh-guh-guh-guh—...what&#x27;s happening?&quot; Porky&#x27;s age varied widely in the series; originally conceived as an innocent seven-year-old piglet (explicitly mentioned as such in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Preview&quot;), Porky was more frequently cast as an adult, often being cast as the competent straight man in the series in later years. At the ending of many &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons, Porky Pig bursts through a bass drum head and says &quot;Th-Th... That&#x27;s all, folks!&quot; Porky Pig appeared in 153 cartoons in the golden age of American animation.

==Early films==
The character was introduced in the 100th short, &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot; (released on March 2, 1935), directed by Friz Freleng. Studio head Leon Schlesinger suggested that Freleng do a cartoon version of the popular &quot;Our Gang&quot; films. Porky only has a minor role in the film, but the fat little stuttering pig quickly became popular. Porky&#x27;s name came from two brothers who were childhood classmates of Freleng, nicknamed &quot;Porky&quot; and &quot;Piggy&quot;.

Since Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising had left the studio in 1933, taking the studio&#x27;s star character Bosko with them, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; had been kept afloat by cartoons featuring the bland Buddy. Porky&#x27;s introduction ushered Buddy out the door and pointed to things to come. Tex Avery was hired by the studio in 1935, and his film &quot;Gold Diggers of &#x27;49&quot; reused much of the cast from &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot;, albeit in wildly different roles. Porky transitioned from a shy little boy to an immensely fat adult. Though he was still in a supporting role, Porky got most of the laughs. The directors realized they had a star on their hands.

Porky shared his stutter with the voice actor who originally played him, Joe Dougherty, who was actually a person who stuttered. Because Dougherty could not control his stutter, however, production costs became too high as his recording sessions took hours, and Porky&#x27;s additional lines were done by Count Cutelli. Mel Blanc replaced Dougherty in 1937. Blanc continued the stutter; however, it was harnessed for a more precise comedic effect (such as stumbling over a simple word only to substitute a longer word without difficulty, or vice versa). This is parodied in &quot;A Connecticut Rabbit in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, where Bugs Bunny struggles to pronounce the word &quot;porcupine&quot;, which Porky pronounces with no trouble.

&quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot; was released in 1937, and Blanc officially became the permanent voice of Porky until his death in 1989. In later interviews, Blanc often said that he intended Porky&#x27;s stutter to be suggestive of the grunting of actual pigs. &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot; was also the first film of another Looney Tunes star, Daffy Duck. Porky Pig is currently voiced by Bob Bergen.

==Clampett&#x27;s Porky==

Porky starred in dozens of films in the late 1930s. The directors still did not have a grasp on the character, however; his appearance, age, and personality all varied from picture to picture. Several such cartoons show Porky as a child with parents: father Phineas (&quot;Porky the Rainmaker&quot;, &quot;Milk and Money&quot;, &quot;Porky&#x27;s Poppa&quot;, and &quot;Porky and Teabiscuit&quot;) and an unnamed mother (&quot;Wholly Smoke&quot; and &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hero Agency&quot;). Bob Clampett finally pinned Porky down in 1939, making him a permanent young adult: cuter, slimmer, smarter, and eventually less of a stutterer. Also, some cartoons show Porky as an antagonist (&quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot;, &quot;Porky&#x27;s Hare Hunt&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Duck&quot;, &quot;A Corny Concerto&quot;, &quot;Duck Soup to Nuts&quot;, &quot;Daffy Doodles&quot;, &quot;Daffy Duck Hunt&quot;, &quot;Boobs in the Woods&quot;, &quot;Thumb Fun&quot; and &quot;Cracked Quack&quot;). Eventually, he settled into a kind persona. Clampett&#x27;s Porky was an innocent traveler, taking in the world&#x27;s wonders—and in Clampett&#x27;s universe, the world is a very weird place. This principle is perhaps best demonstrated in &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot;, a film that sends Porky on a quest to find the last of the surreal Dodos, Yoyo Dodo. &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot; was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry in 2000.

In his commentary as part of the 1970s documentary film &quot;Bugs Bunny: Superstar&quot;, Clampett said that his early version of Tweety Bird had to be redesigned after his first picture because the producers thought he &quot;looked naked&quot;. Meanwhile, as Clampett noted, nothing was ever made of the fact that &quot;all those years, Porky never wore any pants!&quot; However, Porky was seen with pants in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Badtime Story&quot;, &quot;Tick Tock Tuckered&quot; and &quot;Brother Brat&quot;.
==As a sidekick==
Porky&#x27;s post at the pinnacle of the Warners&#x27; pantheon was short-lived. In 1937, the studio tried pairing Porky with various sidekicks, such as love interest Petunia Pig, cantankerous foil Gabby Goat, and a screwy black duck, Daffy. Daffy Duck, the creation of Tex Avery, was by far the most popular, eventually outshining even Porky. In fact, Friz Freleng satirized this phenomenon when he directed &quot;You Ought to Be in Pictures&quot; (1940), where Daffy convinces Porky to quit his job at Warner Bros. to find better-paying work elsewhere. Porky then convinces studio head Leon Schlesinger to release him from his contract. After a highly unsuccessful foray into the real world, Porky returns happily to the studio that created him. To this day, Porky remains as a loyal sidekick while Daffy refuses to be a second banana to Bugs Bunny, who rose to prominence shortly after Daffy.

Porky always remained a sentimental favorite of the Warner directors. His mild-mannered nature and shy demeanor made him the perfect straight man for zanier characters such as Daffy. He still starred in a few solo cartoons as well, such as Frank Tashlin&#x27;s &quot;Brother Brat&quot;. Other cartoons dumbed Porky down and cast him as a duck hunter after Daffy, largely paralleling the Elmer Fudd/Bugs Bunny pairings. Chuck Jones perfected the Porky-as-straight man scenarios, pairing the pig with Daffy Duck in a series of film and television parodies such as &quot;Drip-Along Daffy&quot;, &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot;, &quot;Rocket Squad&quot;, &quot;Deduce, You Say!&quot;, &quot;The Scarlet Pumpernickel&quot; and &quot;Robin Hood Daffy&quot;. Jones also paired Porky with Sylvester in a series of cartoons in the late 1940s and early 1950s, in which Porky plays the curmudgeonly and naive owner of the cat and remains clueless that Sylvester is constantly saving him from homicidal mice, space aliens and other threats.

==Later years==

Porky was used in regular rotation in television syndication beginning in the 1960s, as were the rest of his &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; co-stars. A Saturday morning cartoon, &quot;The Porky Pig Show&quot;, ran from 1964 to 1967. In 1971, he starred in another show, &quot;Porky Pig and Friends&quot;. Both of these programs were collections of old theatrical shorts. Porky also appeared in all the classic film-feature compilations in the 1970s and 1980s. Another such collection was the 1986 film, &quot;Porky Pig in Hollywood&quot;, which ran in art and college theaters.

Porky made an appearance in the Disney/Amblin film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) at the end of the film where he, being paired with Disney&#x27;s Tinkerbell, closes the movie with his famous line &quot;Th-Th-Th-That&#x27;s All Folks!&quot;. It was the last time that Mel Blanc voiced Porky before his death in 1989.

In the 1990s animated series &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, Porky appears as the mentor of Hamton J. Pig. He was voiced by Bob Bergen in &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and &quot;Hero Hamton&quot;, Rob Paulsen in &quot;The Wacko World of Sports&quot;, Noel Blanc in &quot;Fields of Honey&quot;, &quot;The Acme Bowl&quot; and &quot;Hero Hamton&quot;, Joe Alaskey in &quot;Music Day&quot;, and Greg Burson in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Tiny Toons Christmas Special&quot;. Porky also made cameo appearances in &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (where he was voiced by Rob Paulsen in ”De-Zanitized”, Greg Burson in “The Warners&#x27; 65th Anniversary Special”, and Bob Bergen in “Suffragette City”) and &quot;Histeria!&quot; (where he was voiced by Billy West).

Porky appears in the movie &quot;Space Jam&quot; (1996) and collaborates with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, and Sylvester in challenging the Nerdlucks to a basketball game. He tries to get Michael Jordan&#x27;s autograph when the basketball star is first recruited to join the team and later plays for the Tune Squad in the game itself, scoring one basket. Porky tries to end the movie with his famous line but is prevented by the combined efforts of Bugs, Daffy, and the Nerdlucks. He was voiced by Bob Bergen.

Porky is the star of the Super NES video game &quot;Porky Pig&#x27;s Haunted Holiday&quot; (1995). He also made appearances in the games &quot;Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Marvin Strikes Back!&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Space Race&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, &quot;Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage&quot; and &quot;The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout&quot;. Bob Bergen reprises his role in these games.

In the movie &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; (2003), Porky (Bob Bergen again) makes a cameo appearance alongside Speedy Gonzales, where they both lament their politically incorrect status. At the end of the movie, Porky tries to say his classic line, but stutters so much, the lights are turned off around him as the studio closes for the night; so an irritated Porky simply says, &quot;G-g-go home, folks.&quot;

Porky appears as a toddler version of himself in &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot; (2002), albeit only in the show&#x27;s musical numbers. Petunia functioned as the show&#x27;s more major pig character.

Porky appears as the &quot;Eager Young Space Cadet&quot; in the animated series &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; (2003–2005), again voiced by Bob Bergen.

Porky has a descendant in &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot; (2005–2007) named Pinkster Pig (who was also voiced by Bob Bergen). Pinkster had been an old friend of Danger Duck (Daffy Duck&#x27;s descendant), but became a villain when he was adopted by Stoney and Bugsy (descendants of Rocky and Mugsy).

Porky also appears in most episodes of Cartoon Network&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; (2011–2014), voiced again by Bob Bergen. He is still friends with Daffy Duck and often sucked into Daffy&#x27;s schemes. Porky is also Daffy&#x27;s nervous, fall guy buddy, similar to their relationship in classic comic books. It is also revealed in the show that in his high school years, he was a jock who bullied Daffy, while during their childhood years, it was Daffy who bullied Porky.

In the documentary &quot;I Know That Voice&quot; (2013), Bob Bergen explains how to recreate the pig&#x27;s famous stutter, demonstrating how difficult it is to do it without practice. He finishes the segment by joking &quot;Nobody [else] can do that, and that&#x27;s why I have job security!&quot;

Porky appears in the direct-to-video movie &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot; (2015), reprised by Bob Bergen.

Porky Pig appears as a recurring character in &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot;, voiced once again by Bob Bergen. Here, he is shown to be fatter, like some of his earlier appearances in the mid-1930s. Porky was first mentioned in &quot;Dust Bugster&quot;, where he told Bugs about a television series whose name was not mentioned that led to Bugs binge-watching it.

In the 2018 DC Comics and Looney Tunes comic crossovers, Porky appeared in a story that paired him with Lex Luthor. This version of Porky was the successful owner of a company named Porkybux before it was hacked and ran him out of business. He is later approached by Lex to be in charge of LexCorp&#x27;s social media division and lets Lex get away with harassing his employees and stealing their sandwiches as repayment for the second chance. It is later revealed that Lex gave him the position to frame Porky when he used his social media website to steal important passwords from their users. Porky begins an autobiography in prison to expose Lex for his actions. In the backup story stylized more like Looney Tunes, Porky tries selling Acme office supplies to Lex but ends up stopping Lex from defeating Superman.

Porky&#x27;s latest appearance is in &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, where he is once again voiced by Bob Bergen. His personality is based on the earlier shorts, however, his appearance is based on later shorts like &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; for example. He is mostly paired with Daffy Duck who always drives him crazy.

A humanoid version of Porky also appeared in Tom King&#x27;s &quot;Batman/Elmer Fudd Special&quot;, where he ran a bar called Porky&#x27;s which often featured attendants that were humanoid versions of other Looney Tunes characters. The bar and Porky also made a cameo in Tom King&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; series.

Porky appears in the preschool series &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; which aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Cartoonito block and HBO Max, where he is once again voiced by Bob Bergen.

Porky appears in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode, &quot;Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary&quot;. He is among the Looney Tunes characters guests for the Warner Bros. centennial celebration, voiced once again by Bob Bergen.

==&quot;Blooper&quot;==
A short black-and-white cartoon was made in 1938 as part of a Warner Bros. blooper reel. It was shown on the Warner Bros. 50th Anniversary TV show. Porky is shown doing some carpentry work, pounding nails, when he smacks his thumb with the hammer. Grimacing in pain, he cries, &quot;Oh, son of a bi-bi-, son of a bi-bi-, son of a bi-bi-bi-... gun!&quot; He then turns to the viewers and says &quot;Ha-ha-ha! You thought I was gonna say &#x27;s-s-son of a bitch&#x27;, didn&#x27;t ya?&quot;

This short, so-called &quot;blooper&quot; can also be found on the &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4&quot; of 2006, under the title &quot;Porky Pig Breakdowns of 1939&quot; (with several versions of the clip, making it look like a true &quot;blooper&quot;), and on an &quot;Each Dawn I Die&quot; DVD box set, also released in 2006. Though the &quot;blooper&quot; was made a year before &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; famously used the word in the line &quot;Frankly, my dear, I don&#x27;t give a damn&quot;, due to the Motion Picture Production Code the &quot;blooper&quot; was not shown publicly until the aforementioned special, which by that point FCC regulations softened enough for the word &quot;bitch&quot; to be used on television. The blooper was also shown as part of a package of other vintage bloopers on Warner Cable pay-per-view in the 80s. The blooper was animated by Rod Scribner, widely considered as one of the best Looney Tunes animators of all time.

<text>Hans Suess, known as Hans von Kulmbach (1480 in Kulmbach, Franconia – prior to 3 December 1522 in Nuremberg), was a German artist active in Poland. Hans von Kulmbach was the artist who created the Kraków St John&#x27;s Altar.

==Life==
Kulmbach probably arrived in Nuremberg around 1505. He received instruction by Jacopo de&#x27; Barbari, who for a time worked in Nuremberg. Von Kulmbach then apprenticed with Albrecht Dürer and after Dürer retired from painting altarpieces in 1510 Kulmbach took over most of his commissions. Kulmbach had his own workshop in Nuremberg and at times worked in Kraków. He also created artworks for emperor Maximilian I and for Margrave Casimir Hohenzollern von Brandenburg-Kulmbach. His best works were stained-glass windows in churches, such as the Maximilian stained-glass, Margrave stained-glass at St. Sebald in Nuremberg, the Welser stained-glass at the Frauenkirche and the Nikolaus altar at Lorenzkirche. In 1511 he finished the St. Mary&#x27;s altar at Skałka in Kraków. The Catherine and St. John&#x27;s altar also in Kraków, are among his best works.

<text>The Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, officially the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, is the executive committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

Currently, the bureau is a group of 24 top officials who oversee the party and central government. The politburo is headed by the general secretary. Unlike the politburos of other communist parties, the CCP Politburo subdelegates many of its powers to the smaller Politburo Standing Committee.

The Politburo is elected by the Central Committee. In practice, however, scholars of Chinese elite politics believe that the Politburo is a self-perpetuating body, with new members of both the Politburo and its Standing Committee chosen through a series of deliberations by current Politburo members and retired Politburo Standing Committee members. The current and former Politburo members conduct a series of informal straw polls to determine the group&#x27;s level of support for each new candidate&#x27;s membership in the Politburo. The process for selecting the new Politburo begins with a closed door meeting by the incumbent Politburo Standing Committee in Beidaihe in the summer before the National Congress of the CCP convenes.

The power of the Politburo resides largely in the fact that its members generally simultaneously hold positions within the People&#x27;s Republic of China state positions and with the control over personnel appointments that the Politburo and Secretariat have. In addition, some Politburo members hold powerful regional positions. How the Politburo works internally is unclear, but it appears that the full Politburo meets once a month and the standing committee meets weekly. This is believed to be much less frequent than meetings of the former Soviet Politburo. The agenda for the meetings is controlled by the CCP general secretary and decisions are made by consensus rather than by majority vote.

== History ==
The Politburo was eclipsed by the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party in the early 1980s under Hu Yaobang, but has re-emerged as a dominant force after Hu&#x27;s ousting in 1987.

== Composition and selection ==
Since the 1990s, Politburo members concurrently held posts in the party apparatus, in state posts, and as regional party chiefs. Some are party secretaries of important provinces or municipalities. In addition, members serving in the military and security sectors have been limited to 3 posts. In contrast, most members in the 1980s had a military command background. In 2017, for the 19th Central Committee Politburo, aside from the heads of the four main institutional hierarchies—the CCP, the National People&#x27;s Congress, the State Council and the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, there were six members each holding posts in the party, the national government, the regional governments, and three in the military. The average age of the 2017 Politburo&#x27;s members was 62, which was similar to those in recent decades. Before that, the Party under Deng Xiaoping deliberately encouraged turnover by imposing term limits and retirement ages.

In October 2017, at the First Plenary Session of the 19th CCP Central Committee, it was decided that all Politburo members shall make an annual written presentation to the Central Committee and the General Secretary. In March 2018, all Standing Committee members and members of the Politburo made their first written presentation to the Central Committee and General Secretary Xi Jinping.

Since the 17th National Congress, the official way of electing the Politburo was through a process called &quot;democratic recommendation&quot; () where the CCP conducted a straw poll of 200 candidates to the Politburo, which were factored into the final list of candidates presented at the National Congress of the CCP. However, this was abolished in the 19th National Congress under Xi, which denounced the &quot;vote buying&quot; and the &quot;voting based on personal connections and favors&quot; of this method, particularly in connection to politicians who fell after the anti-corruption campaign under Xi. The process was officially replaced with a method of &quot;face-to-face interviews, investigation and study&quot;.

=== Current composition ===
The 20th Politburo was elected at the first plenary session of the 20th Central Committee in October 2022. Xi Jinping’s persistence in his third five-year term represents a departure from the pattern of decade-long reigns for leaders, such as Mao and Deng.

=== Cadre training ===

In 2001, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party published the &quot;2001-2005 National Plan for Cadre Training&quot; elevating the importance of cadre training for Chinese economic reform. The salaries of staff in party schools were brought in line with the salaries paid in regular Chinese universities. Teaching, research, and information technology was modernized to enable distance education throughout the party school system. 

Modern cadre training focuses on &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;ability&quot;. Students are trained in ideological orthodoxy, submitting to Leninism and party discipline. The young cadre is trained in applying their knowledge creatively and independently, so as to deal flexibly with complex issues and accept continuous learning. The initiative for cadre training after 2002 was buttressed by the Central Party School, and the regional party schools, including the Party Schools in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

== Functions ==
The Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee are the top decision-making institutions for the CCP Central Committee. According to the CCP constitution, the party&#x27;s Central Committee elects the Politburo during a plenary session. Members of the Politburo are deputy-national-level leaders or more.

=== Politburo meetings ===
The Politburo typically meets once a month. The General Secretary of the Central Committee is responsible for convening the meetings of the Politburo and decides their agenda. The CCP almost always releases a readout to summarize the outcomes of Politburo meetings and, since 2002, these sessions have been widely publicized. Frequently, they address foreign affairs.

Since 2002, the Politburo has regularly held &quot;collective study sessions&quot; and more standard &quot;Politburo meetings&quot;. The standard meetings discuss new policy directives, provide feedback on policy implementation and prepare for future work conferences, plenums, or congresses. The &quot;collective study sessions&quot; serve as an opportunity for CCP leadership to promote new policies. They generally take place shortly after the standard meetings, usually on the same day or the day after. The Politburo invites professors, think tank scholars or other experts to give a lecture to the Politburo members about a topic chosen by the General Secretary. These lectures often end with &quot;work recommendations&quot; for the Politburo and conclude with a speech by the General Secretary on the study topic. The collective study sessions are often publicized and play an important role to signal leadership priorities to cadres.

<doc id="51852" wikidata="Q177749" url="?curid=51852" title="Sidewalk">
<text>A sidewalk (North American English) or pavement (British English) is a path along the side of a road. Usually constructed of concrete, pavers, brick, stone, or asphalt, it is designed for pedestrians. A sidewalk is normally higher than the roadway, and separated from it by a curb. There may also be a planted strip between the sidewalk and the roadway and between the roadway and the adjacent land.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;sidewalk&quot; is preferred in most of the United States &amp; Canada. The term &quot;pavement&quot; is more common in the United Kingdom and other members of the Commonwealth of Nations, as well as parts of the Mid-Atlantic United States such as Philadelphia and parts of New Jersey. Many Commonwealth countries use the term &quot;footpath&quot;. The professional, civil engineering and legal term for this in the USA and Canada is &quot;sidewalk&quot; while in the United Kingdom it is &quot;pavement&quot;.

In the United States, the term &quot;sidewalk&quot; is used for the pedestrian path beside a road. &quot;Shared use paths&quot; or &quot;multi-use paths&quot; are available for use by both pedestrians and bicyclists. &quot;Walkway&quot; is a more comprehensive term that includes stairs, ramps, passageways, and related structures that facilitate the use of a path as well as the sidewalk. In the UK, the term &quot;footpath&quot; is mostly used for paths that do not abut a roadway. The term &quot;shared-use path&quot; is used where cyclists are also able to use the same section of path as pedestrians.

==History==

Sidewalks have operated for at least 4,000 years. The Greek city of Corinth had sidewalks by the 4th-century BC, and the Romans built sidewalks – they called them &quot;&quot;.

However, by the Middle Ages, narrow roads had reverted to being simultaneously used by pedestrians and wagons without any formal separation between the two categories. Early attempts at ensuring the adequate maintenance of foot-ways or sidewalks were often made, as in the Colchester Improvement Act 1623 (21 Jas. 1. c. &quot;34&quot;) for Colchester, but they were generally not very effective.

Following the Great Fire of London in 1666, attempts were slowly made to bring some order to the sprawling city. In 1671, &quot;Certain Orders, Rules and Directions Touching the Paving and Cleansing The Streets, Lanes and Common Passages within the City of London&quot; were formulated, calling for all streets to be adequately paved for pedestrians with cobblestones. Purbeck stone was widely used as a durable paving material. Bollards were also installed to protect pedestrians from the traffic in the middle of the road.

The British House of Commons passed a series of Paving Acts from the 18th century. The 1766 Paving &amp; Lighting Act authorized the City of London Corporation to establish foot-ways throughout all the streets of London, to pave them with Purbeck stone (the thoroughfare in the middle was generally cobblestone) and to raise them above the street level with kerbs forming the separation. The corporation was also made responsible for the regular upkeep of the roads, including their cleaning and repair, for which they charged a tax from 1766. Another turning point was the construction of Paris&#x27;s Pont Neuf (1578–1606) which set several trends including wide, raised sidewalks separating pedestrians from the road traffic, plus the first Parisian bridge without houses built on it, and its generous width plus elegant, durable design that immediately became popular for promenading at the beginning of the century that saw Paris take its form renowned to this day. It was also a cultural phenomenon because all classes mixed on the new walkways. By the 19th-century large and spacious sidewalks were routinely constructed in European capitals, and were associated with urban sophistication.

==Benefits==

===Transportation===
Sidewalks played an important role in transportation, as they provided a path for people to walk along without stepping on horse manure. They aided road safety by minimizing interaction between pedestrians, horses, carriages, and later automobiles. Sidewalks are normally in pairs, one on each side of the road, with the center section of the road for motorized vehicles. Crosswalks provide pedestrians a space to cross between the two sides of the street at predictable locations.

On rural roads, sidewalks may not be present as the amount of traffic (pedestrian or motorized) may not be enough to justify separating the two. In suburban and urban areas, sidewalks are more common. In town and city centers (known as downtown in the USA) the amount of pedestrian traffic can exceed motorized traffic, and in this case the sidewalks can occupy more than half of the width of the road, or the whole road can be pedestrianized.

===Environment===
Sidewalks may have a small effect on reducing vehicle miles traveled and carbon dioxide emissions. A study of sidewalk and transit investments in Seattle neighborhoods found vehicle travel reductions of 6 to 8% and CO2 emission reductions of 1.3 to 2.2%

===Road traffic safety===

Research commissioned for the Florida Department of Transportation, published in 2005, found that, in Florida, the Crash Reduction Factor (used to estimate the expected reduction of crashes during a given period) resulting from the installation of sidewalks averaged 74%.
Research at the University of North Carolina for the U.S. Department of Transportation found that the presence or absence of a sidewalk and the speed limit are significant factors in the likelihood of a vehicle/pedestrian crash. Sidewalk presence had a risk ratio of 0.118, which means that the likelihood of a crash on a road with a paved sidewalk was 88.2 percent lower than one without a sidewalk. The authors wrote that &quot;this should not be interpreted to mean that installing sidewalks would necessarily reduce the likelihood of pedestrian/motor vehicle crashes by 88.2 percent in all situations. However, the presence of a sidewalk clearly has a strong beneficial effect of reducing the risk of a &#x27;walking along roadway&#x27; pedestrian/motor vehicle crash.&quot; The study does not count crashes that happen when walking across a roadway. The speed limit risk ratio was 1.116, which means that a 16.1-km/h (10-mi/h) increase in the limit yields a factor of (1.116)10 or 3.

The presence or absence of sidewalks was one of three factors that were found to encourage drivers to choose lower, safer speeds.

On the other hand, the implementation of schemes which involve the removal of sidewalks, such as shared space schemes, are reported to deliver a dramatic drop in crashes and congestion too, which indicates that a number of other factors, such as the local speed environment, also play an important role in whether sidewalks are necessarily the best local solution for pedestrian safety.

In cold weather, black ice is a common problem with unsalted sidewalks. The ice forms a thin transparent surface film which is almost impossible to see, and so results in many slips by pedestrians.

Riding bicycles on sidewalks is discouraged since some research shows it to be more dangerous than riding in the street. Some jurisdictions prohibit sidewalk riding except for children. In addition to the risk of cyclist/pedestrian collisions, cyclists face increase risks from collisions with motor vehicles at street crossings and driveways. Riding in the direction opposite to traffic in the adjacent lane is especially risky.

===Health===

Since residents of neighborhoods with sidewalks are more likely to walk, they tend to have lower rates of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other health issues related to sedentary lifestyles. Also, children who walk to school have been shown to have better concentration.

===Social uses===

Some sidewalks may be used as social spaces with sidewalk cafés, markets, or busking musicians, as well as for parking for a variety of vehicles including cars, motorbikes and bicycles. Sidewalk surfing was often used in the early 1960s to describe skateboarding.)

==Construction==
Contemporary sidewalks are most often made of concrete in North America, while tarmac, asphalt, brick, stone, slab and (increasingly) rubber are more common in Europe. Different materials are more or less friendly environmentally: pumice-based trass, for example, when used as an extender is less energy-intensive than Portland cement concrete or petroleum-based materials such as asphalt or tar-penetration macadam. Multi-use paths alongside roads are sometimes made of materials that are softer than concrete, such as asphalt.

Some sidewalks may be built like a Meandering Sidewalk. The meandering sidewalk is the wavy sidewalk that veers back and forth at the side of the road, no matter how straight the street. These sidewalks are common in North America and are used to break up the monotonous alignments of city blocks.

===Wood===
In the 19th century and early 20th century, sidewalks of wood were common in some North American locations. They may still be found at historic beach locations and in conservation areas to protect the land beneath and around, called boardwalks.

===Brick===
Brick sidewalks are found in some urban areas, usually for aesthetic purposes. Brick sidewalks are generally consolidated with brick hammers, rollers, and sometimes motorized vibrators.

===Stone===

Stone slabs called &quot;flagstones&quot; or &quot;flags&quot; are sometimes used where an attractive appearance is required, as in historic town centers.

For example, in Melbourne, Australia, bluestone has been used to pave the sidewalks of the CBD since the Gold rush in the 1850s because it proved to be stronger, more plentiful and easier to work than most other available materials.

===Stone and concrete pavers===

Pre-cast concrete pavers are used for sidewalks, often colored or textured to resemble stone. Sometimes cobblestones are used, though they are generally considered too uneven for comfortable walking.

===Concrete===
In the United States and Canada, the most common type of sidewalk consists of a poured concrete &quot;ribbon&quot;, examples of which from as early as the 1860s can be found in good repair in San Francisco, and stamped with the name of the contractor and date of installation. When Portland cement was first imported to the United States in the 1880s, its principal use was in the construction of sidewalks.

Today, most sidewalk ribbons are constructed with cross-lying strain-relief grooves placed or sawn at regular intervals, typically apart. This partitioning, an improvement over the continuous slab ribbon, was patented in 1924 by Arthur Wesley Hall and William Alexander McVay, who wished to minimize damage to the concrete from the effects of tectonic and temperature fluctuations, both of which can crack longer segments. The technique is not perfect, as freeze-thaw cycles (in cold-winter regions) and tree root growth can eventually result in damage which requires repair.

In highly variable climates which undergo multiple freeze-thaw cycles, concrete blocks will be formed with separations, called expansion joints, to allow for thermal expansion without breakage. The use of expansion joints in sidewalks may not be necessary, as the concrete will shrink while setting.

===Tarmac and asphalt===
In the United Kingdom, Australia and France suburban sidewalks are most commonly constructed of tarmac. In urban or inner-city areas sidewalks are most commonly constructed of slabs, stone, or brick depending upon the surrounding street architecture and furniture.

<doc id="51853" wikidata="Q302057" url="?curid=51853" title="John Doe">
<text>[[John (given name)|John]] Doe (male) and [[Jane (given name)|Jane]] Doe (female) are multiple-use placeholder names that are used in the British and American legal system and aside generally in the United Kingdom and the United States when the true name of a person is unknown or is being intentionally concealed. In the context of law enforcement in the United States, such names are often used to refer to a corpse whose identity is unknown or cannot be confirmed. These names are also often used to refer to a hypothetical &quot;everyman&quot; in other contexts, like John Q. Public or &quot;Joe Public&quot;. There are many variants to the above names, including John (or Richard)/Jane Roe, John/Jane Smith, John/Jane Bloggs, and Johnie/Janie Doe or just Baby Doe for children. A. N. Other is also a placeholder name, mainly used in the United Kingdomwhich is gender neutralalongside Joe/Jo Bloggs and the now occasional use of the &quot;John&quot; and &quot;Jane Doe&quot; names.

==In criminal investigation==
In other English-speaking countries, unique placeholder names, numbers or codenames have become more often used in the context of police investigations. This has included the United Kingdom, where usage of &quot;John Doe&quot; originated during the Middle Ages. However, the legal term &quot;John Doe injunction&quot; or &quot;John Doe order&quot; has survived in English law and other legal systems influenced by it. Other names, such as &quot;Joe Bloggs&quot; or &quot;John Smith&quot;, have sometimes been informally used as placeholders for an every-man in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand; however such names are seldom used in legal or police circles in the same sense as John Doe.

Well-known legal cases named after placeholders include:
* The landmark 1973 US Supreme Court decisions regarding abortion: &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (&quot;Roe&quot; being a pseudonym) and &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; (1973); and
* The civil cases &quot;Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe v Yates, Hawker, and Mudge&quot; (1822) 5 B. &amp; Ald. 544 (England), &quot;McKeogh v. John Doe&quot; (Ireland; 2012) and &quot;Uber Technologies, Inc. v. Doe I&quot; (California, 2015).

==History==
Under the legal terminology of Ancient Rome, the names &quot;&quot;Numerius Negidius&quot; and &quot;Aulus Agerius&quot;&quot; were used in relation to hypothetical defendants and plaintiffs. The names &quot;John Doe&quot; (or &quot;John Doo&quot;) and &quot;Richard Roe&quot; (along with &quot;John Roe&quot;) were regularly invoked in English legal instruments to satisfy technical requirements governing standing and jurisdiction, beginning perhaps as early as the reign of England&#x27;s King Edward III (1327–1377). Though the rationale behind the choices of Doe and Roe is unknown, there are many suggested folk etymologies. Other fictitious names for a person involved in litigation in medieval English law were &quot;John Noakes&quot; (or &quot;Nokes&quot;) and &quot;John-a-Stiles&quot; (or &quot;John Stiles&quot;). The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that John Doe is &quot;the name given to the fictitious lessee of the plaintiff, in the (now obsolete in the UK) mixed action of ejectment, the fictitious defendant being called Richard Roe&quot;.

This usage is mocked in the 1834 English song &quot;John Doe and Richard Roe&quot;:
This particular use became obsolete in the UK in 1852:

In the UK, usage of &quot;John Doe&quot; survives mainly in the form of John Doe injunction or John Doe order (see above).

Unlike the United States, the name &quot;John Doe&quot; does not actually appear in the formal name of the case, for example: &quot;X &amp; Y v Persons Unknown&quot; [2007] HRLR 4. Well-known cases of unidentified decedents include &quot;Caledonia Jane Doe&quot; (1979), &quot;Princess Doe&quot; (1982) and &quot;Walker County Jane Doe&quot; (1980), all of whom have been identified. In 1997, New York City police discovered a decapitated body and were not able to find the killer. The body was named Peaches (murder victim) and also Jane Doe 3. The baby victim in a 2001 murder case in Kansas City, Missouri, was referred to as Precious Doe.

In 2009, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported the difficulties and unwanted attention experienced by a man actually named John Doe, who had often been suspected of using a pseudonym. He had been questioned repeatedly by airport security staff. Another man named John Doe was often suspected of being an incognito celebrity.

==Other variants==
In cases where a large number of unidentified individuals are mentioned, numbers may be appended, such as &quot;Doe #2&quot; or &quot;Doe II&quot;. Operation Delego (2009), which targeted an international child sexual abuse ring, cited 21 numbered &quot;John Does&quot;, as well as other people known by the surnames &quot;Doe&quot;, &quot;Roe&quot;, &quot;Hoe&quot; and &quot;Poe&quot;. &quot;John Stiles&quot;, &quot;Richard Miles&quot; have been used for the third and fourth participants in an action. &quot;Mary Major&quot; has been used in some federal cases in the US. &quot;James Doe&quot; and &quot;Judy Doe&quot; are among other common variants.

Less often, other surnames ending in &quot;-oe&quot; have been used when more than two unknown or unidentified persons are named in U.S. court proceedings, &quot;e.g.&quot;,
* &quot;Poe v. Snyder&quot;, 834 F.Supp.2d 721 (W. D. Mich. 2011), whose full style is &quot;Jane Poe, John Doe, Richard Roe, Robert Roe, Mark Moe, Larry Loe, Degage Ministries, and Mel Trotter Ministries, Plaintiffs, v. Rick Snyder, Governor of the State of Michigan, Bill Schuette, Attorney General of the State of Michigan, Kriste Etue, Director of the Michigan State Police, William Forsyth, Kent County Prosecutor, in their official capacities, Defendants&quot;; and
* &quot;Friedman v. Ferguson&quot;, No. 87-3758, unpublished disposition, 850 F.2d 689 (4th Cir., 29 June 1988), whose full style is &quot;Wilbur H. Friedman, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. Thomas B. FERGUSON, Director, Department of Animal Control, a State Actor, In His Official and Individual Capacities; Brett Boe; Carla Coe; Donna Doe; Frank Foe; Grace Goe; Harry Hoe; State Actors, Advisors To Defendant Ferguson, In Their Official and Individual Capacities (identities currently unknown); Marta Moe; Norma Noe; Paula Poe; Ralph Roe; Sammy Soe; Tommy Toe; Private Individuals Who Conspired With the Foregoing State Actors (identities currently unknown); Roger W. Galvin, Chairman, Animal Matters Hearing Board; Vince Voe; William Woe; Xerxes Xoe; Members of the Animal Matters Hearing Board, State Actors, In Their Official and Individual Capacities (identities currently unknown), Defendants-Appellees&quot;.

In Massachusetts, &quot;Mary Moe&quot; is used to refer to pregnant women under the age of 18 petitioning the Superior Court for a judicial bypass exception to the parental consent requirement for abortion. &quot;Mary Moe&quot; is also used to refer to such cases generally, i.e. &quot;Mary Moe cases&quot;. Sometimes &quot;Mary Doe&quot; may be used for the individuals. Parallels in other countries include:
* &quot;Ashok Kumar&quot; has been used in court cases in India.
* &quot;X ben X&quot; (, or ) is used in Morocco for unidentified bodies, suspects, hospital patients, amnesiacs, homeless people with no identity documents, and orphans.
* the abbreviation &quot;N.N.&quot;, which is commonly used in European legal systems, as an abbreviation for Latin terms such as:
** &quot;nomen nescio&quot; (&quot;I do not know the name&quot;) in Belgium, Germany, Italy and Serbia; and
** &quot;nomen nominandum&quot; (&quot;the name must be mentioned&quot;) in the Netherlands.
* &quot;Ploni&quot;, &quot;Almoni&quot;, or &quot;Ploni Almoni&quot; are used in Israel, the names originating in the Hebrew Bible. &quot;Israel Israeli&quot; is a newer variant, used in Israel today.

==Famous court cases==
* The landmark 1973 abortion cases &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; get their names from anonymous plaintiffs later revealed to be, respectively, Norma McCorvey and Sandra Cano.
* A Toronto woman, publicly known only as Jane Doe, waged an 11-year court battle against the Toronto Police Service after being raped in 1986, alleging that the police had used her as bait to catch the Balcony Rapist. She won the case in 1998, and was named &quot;Chatelaine&quot; Woman of the Year that year. She published a book about her experience, &quot;The Story of Jane Doe: A Book about Rape&quot;, in 2003.
* A Doe subpoena is an investigatory tool that a plaintiff may use to seek the identity of an unknown defendant. Doe subpoenas are often served on online service providers and ISPs to obtain the identity of the author of an anonymous post.
*Serial killer Richard Laurence Marquette confessed to the murder of an unknown woman identified only as Jane Doe.
*File sharing websites were blocked in India on 21 July 2011 on some ISPs including Bharti Airtel, BSNL, and Reliance Communications, because Reliance BIG Pictures got a &quot;John Doe&quot; order from Delhi High Court allowing them to serve cease and desist notices on people illegally redistributing the film &quot;Singham&quot;. This allegedly brought down copyright infringement of the film by 30%.
*On 29 August 2011, Reliance Entertainment procured a &#x27;John Doe&#x27; order from the Delhi High Court to prevent the illegal broadcast or streaming of its upcoming film &quot;Bodyguard&quot;. This order gives protection to the intellectual property owner, Reliance Entertainment, from copyright violation by prospective anonymous offenders. The use and selection of pseudonyms is not standardized in U.S. courts. The practice was rare prior to 1969, and is sometimes objected to on legal grounds. 
*On 18 January 2015, a woman was sexually assaulted on the campus of Stanford University in California. The victim impact statement that the woman, referred to as Emily Doe in court documents, read at her assailant&#x27;s sentencing hearing the following year went viral, and she was named a &quot;woman of the year&quot; by &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine. She publicly revealed her real name, Chanel Miller, in 2019.
*On 10 March 2015, HTG Capital Partners LLC filed a federal lawsuit against unnamed &quot;spoofers&quot;, whom the suit referred to as John Doe(s), in the hopes of getting a judge to force the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to reveal the names of the firms. HTG said it had found evidence of thousands of such manipulations over 2013 and 2014.
*In November 2016, a woman only identified as &quot;Jane Doe&quot; abandoned plans to go public about allegedly being raped by Donald Trump.
*In October 2017, an unidentified minor Jane Doe detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sued to enjoin the government from obstructing her access to abortion in &quot;Garza v. Hargan&quot;.
*In March 2021, Justice Molloy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice named mass murderer and perpetrator of the 2018 Toronto van attack, Alek Minassian, who was seeking notoriety, as John Doe when reading a highly publicized court decision (R. v. Minassian, 2021 ONSC 1258).

<text>Albertsons Companies, Inc. is an American grocery company founded and headquartered in Boise, Idaho.

With 2,253 stores as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and 270,000 employees as of fiscal year 2019, the company is the second-largest supermarket chain in North America after Kroger. Albertsons ranked 53rd in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Prior to its January 2015 merger with Safeway Inc. for $9.2 billion, it had 1,075 supermarkets located in 29 U.S. states under 12 different regional banners. Its predecessor company, Albertsons, Inc., was reorganized as Albertsons LLC and sold to AB Acquisition LLC, a Cerberus Capital Management–led consortium. After buying back the majority of its former stores it sold to SuperValu in 2006, AB Acquisition announced it would change its name to Albertsons Companies Inc. in 2015. The company&#x27;s corporate name was Albertson&#x27;s Inc. until 2002, when the apostrophe was removed.

On October 14, 2022, Albertsons announced it would be acquired by rival Kroger for $25 billion. On November 30, 2023, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen announced that the companies had satisfied the informational requirements of the Federal Trade Commission, and the deal was expected to close in early 2024. However, in January 2024, Washington state sued to block the proposed $25 billion merger between Kroger and Albertsons, warning that if approved it could raise prices and harm consumers. In February 2024, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser also filed a lawsuit, saying consumers told him they feared it &quot;would lead to stores closing, higher prices, fewer jobs, worse customer service, and less resilient supply chains.&quot; Kroger and Albertsons terminated their merger attempt on December 11, 2024, following its block by a federal and a state judge.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Albertsons was founded in 1939 by Joe Albertson (1906–1993) on July 21 in Boise, Idaho. An ad in Boise&#x27;s &quot;Idaho Statesman&quot; newspaper touted Albertson&#x27;s first store as &quot;Idaho&#x27;s largest and finest food store.&quot; The store was filled with perks that, at the time, were brand new: free parking, a money-back guarantee, and even an ice cream shop. The original store was built onto several times, but it was demolished in 1979, and a replacement store was built on the same property. A brick monument stands on the northwest corner of 16th and State Streets in downtown Boise, commemorating the original store.
The grocery store was an enormous success, and Albertson reinvested his profits back into the business. New stores were opened in neighboring towns to the west: Nampa, Caldwell, and Emmett, before America&#x27;s entry into World War II in late 1941. The company grew steadily in the years following World War II. When Albertson was considering putting a new store in a town, he would drive around the town and look for neighborhoods with children&#x27;s clothing hanging on clotheslines, and station wagons in driveways; he knew that those kinds of neighborhoods were where he wanted to build his stores.

Albertson&#x27;s, Inc. became a public company in 1959, and its growth continued, opening its hundredth store in Seattle in 1963. in 1964, Albertsons expanded to southern California by acquiring All American Markets, a small chain based in Orange County.

In 1967, Albertsons expanded into Colorado, acquiring eight stores from Furr&#x27;s Supermarkets. By the end of the 1960s, Albertsons operated over 200 stores within a nine-state region and the stores averaged about 20,000 square feet in size.

===Partnership with Skaggs and 1970s expansion===
In 1969, Albertsons partnered with Skaggs Drug Centers, owned by the Skaggs Companies, Inc., to create the first combination food/drug stores, first in Texas. The partnership was a tremendous success for several years. The partnership ended due to the fact that it was getting more difficult to control. Neither partner could buy the other out, and the partnership was dissolved amicably in 1977. Skaggs kept stores in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, and Albertsons kept stores in Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana, as well as some Texas stores (based in San Antonio).

Albertsons continued to expand its base in the West during this time. In 1973, Albertsons opened its first distribution center in Brea, California. In 1974, Albertsons bought the four-store Monte Mart chain in northern California.
Albertsons bought Fazio&#x27;s Shopping Bag in 1978 from Fisher Foods, adding 46 stores in Southern California.

===Expansion in the 1980s===
In 1981, Albertsons entered Nebraska and South Dakota.

In 1982, Albertsons reorganized its management into four regions: California, Northwest, Intermountain, and South. Albertsons continued to add stores in the 1980s, building or acquiring about 283 stores during the decade. Albertsons continued to expand in Texas beyond the Skaggs base in north Texas and San Antonio, re-entering the Dallas–Fort Worth market in 1984, and adding three Skaggs-Alpha Beta stores in Austin within months after entering that market in early 1989 with the acquisition of six Tom Thumb stores.

Albertsons built its first fully mechanized distribution center in Portland, Oregon, in 1988.

In 1989, Albertsons opened its 500th store, in Temecula, California.

===Expansion in the 1990s===

Albertsons began to expand heavily in the 1990s. In 1992, Albertsons bought the stores American Stores (formerly Skaggs Drugs Cos.) had in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Florida. Many of the stores had been opened as Skaggs Albertsons originally (later turning into &quot;Skaggs Alpha Beta&quot; under American Stores ownership) but by 1991 had been rebranded as Jewel-Osco. These included a few stores that American Stores opened in the late 1980s under that name in Florida. Additionally, a non-food distribution center in Ponca City, Oklahoma, was purchased from ASC.

In 1994, Albertsons would acquire four stores from San Diego County chain Big Bear Markets.

The Skaggs acquisition was a success, and the new stores were integrated into Albertsons&#x27;s Southern division. The ease of that acquisition and Albertsons&#x27;s high-flying stock price led Albertsons to attempt expansion on a grand scale. In a series of acquisitions in the late 1990s, Albertsons purchased Seessel&#x27;s and 14 other stores from Bruno&#x27;s, Buttrey Food &amp; Drug (divesting seven Buttrey stores and six Albertsons stores to Smith&#x27;s and another two Buttrey stores to SuperValu), the Springfield, Missouri Smitty&#x27;s chain, and three Super One Foods stores from Miner&#x27;s Inc. in the Des Moines market, all while building new stores across all divisions. These acquisitions brought Albertsons into five new states: Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, and Tennessee.

==== Albertsons Express gas stations ====
Albertsons launched a new branch of their brand in 1997, Albertsons Express, which included a fuel center and a convenience store. The first of the Albertsons Express opened that year in Eagle, Idaho. This branch was constructed in front of the parking lot of Albertson&#x27;s full-size grocery store at the city&#x27;s Parkcenter Boulevard. This concept was not limited to Idaho; it expanded to locations across America located on Albertsons’ existing/new stores properties. A few of the locations with Express Gas Stations include Gresham, Hillsboro, and Portland in Oregon; Houston in Texas; and Casper and Cheyenne in Wyoming.

====American Stores acquisition====
In 1998, Albertsons made its biggest acquisition yet: American Stores Company, which included the chains ACME in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware; Lucky in California and Nevada; Jewel and Jewel-Osco in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa, and two drug store chains: Osco Drug, with a presence in New England, the Midwest, Montana and Arizona; and Sav-on Drugs, with a presence in Southern California, Nevada, Western Arizona, and New Mexico. The acquisition briefly made Albertsons the largest American food and drug operator, with over 2,500 stores (including stand-alone drug stores) in 37 states, until Kroger&#x27;s acquisition of Fred Meyer closed the following month. To make the acquisition, Albertsons was forced by anti-trust concerns to divest 146 stores, primarily in California, Nevada, and New Mexico, to Certified Grocers: Raley&#x27;s, Ralphs, Stater Bros., and Vons. In California, Nevada, and New Mexico, there were already Albertsons stores, so in order to not have two banners in the same area, 508 Lucky stores were converted to the Albertsons banner in November 1999, and the Lucky brand name was retired. The brand was reintroduced in the early 2000s.

In January 2001, Albertsons restructured its &quot;districts&quot; to a divisional structure mostly based around distribution centers, with a drug store division and 18 regional division offices.

===2001–2004 restructuring===
On July 18, 2001, Larry Johnston, the new chairman and CEO of Albertson&#x27;s, announced it would close 165 &quot;underperforming&quot; stores spread across 25 states, cut jobs, and reduce its newly created operating divisions. The first change was that the Utah, Idaho, and Big Sky (Montana) division were merged back into Intermountain, while Oregon, Washington, and the Inland Empire (eastern Washington and Northern Idaho) division would be consolidated back into a single Northwestern division. Albertsons sold its freestanding Osco Drug stores in the northeastern states to Jean Coutu Group, a Canadian drug store company (those stores were re-branded as Brooks Pharmacy after the sale was completed in January 2002). In 2001, the short-lived Des Moines stores would close as well and Albertsons began to issue Albertsons Preferred Savings Cards for all of its stores.

The following year, three more divisions were closed entirely:

* San Antonio: Having been in San Antonio since the Skaggs Albertsons days, at the time Albertsons was ranked as the area&#x27;s number two grocer by market share, compared to H-E-B&#x27;s top position in the market. At the time of the withdrawal, the 44-store H-E-B chain held a commanding 61 percent market share, while Albertsons held a 15 percent market share. Albertsons had held the third position at the time Kroger exited the market in mid-1993 when it closed its 15 area stores. Then, H-E-B&#x27;s 37 area stores held a 43.2 percent market share, Kroger&#x27;s 15 area stores a 13.7 percent share, and Albertsons&#x27;s 10 stores a 13.1 percent share. The remaining stores in the San Antonio division, primarily in the Austin area, became part of the Dallas division. The last store in South Texas to close, a store in Victoria, Texas, was closed in October.
* Mid-South: In 2002, Albertsons shuttered its Mid-South division by selling its Seessel&#x27;s supermarket chain in Memphis to Schnucks and stores in Mississippi to Brookshire&#x27;s. The Albertsons-branded stores in the Nashville area, most of which had previously been Bruno&#x27;s stores under the Foodmax banner, were sold to either Publix (marking its entry into the market) or Kroger.
* Houston: After entering the market in the early 1990s, the troubled Houston division would be gone too, with Albertsons closing its 43 area stores, with most reopening as Kroger or Randalls (acquired with Safeway in 2015 and subsequent return to Houston), with 2 of them becoming H-E-B stores. The Louisiana stores from that division joined the Florida division (though they would move to the Dallas division soon after), while the stores in the Bryan–College Station area became part of the Dallas division. The Greater Houston distribution center near Katy, built in 1996 was sold to 99 Cents Only Stores in 2003.

Additionally, the distribution center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, (home of the Great Plains division) was sold to Fleming Companies, though no stores were closed. The Great Plains division stretched all the way into Omaha, Nebraska. The sale of the distribution center included a distribution deal for Fleming to continue to supply Oklahoma and Omaha.

After stabilizing the company&#x27;s finances and consolidating divisions in 2004, Albertsons acquired Shaw&#x27;s Supermarkets and Star Market from Sainsbury&#x27;s for $2.5 billion. Albertsons also purchased Bristol Farms for $135 million. During the same time, Albertsons exited the markets of Omaha, where it closed or sold 21 stores, and New Orleans, Louisiana, where it closed seven, selling four to A&amp;P, which converted them to Sav-A-Center.

===Sale to Cerberus and SuperValu===

Despite this, the acquisition spree had caused significant problems for Albertsons, Inc. Many of the acquired chains had systems that did not mesh well with Albertsons. Financing those acquisitions required Albertsons Inc. to take on significant debt. Added to those problems were significant changes in consumer buying patterns, including new competition from large discounters such as Walmart and Costco that impacted sales.

After several assessments of the company and months of rumors, it was announced on January 23, 2006, Albertsons, Inc. was to be sold to a consortium of companies. SuperValu would take the bulk of the company including the brand names and what was considered to be the stronger divisions, including 3 Albertsons divisions: the Southern California division (Southern California; Southern Nevada; along with stores in Hanford and Tulare, in Northern California), the Northwest division (Oregon except Ontario, Washington State, and the Idaho Panhandle), and the Intermountain division (Southern Idaho; Elko, Nevada; Utah; Jackson and Rock Springs, Wyoming; Montana; Ontario, Oregon; and North Dakota) as well as the ACME, Bristol Farms, Jewel-Osco, and Shaw&#x27;s Supermarkets and Star Market brands. This acquisition would also lead to SuperValu gaining access to over 100 Albertsons Express fuel centers.

CVS would acquire 702 stand-alone Osco and Sav-on Drug stores and converted them to CVS Pharmacy stores. They also closed about 100 of the 702.

What was left of Albertsons Inc. became Albertsons, LLC, purchased by a Cerberus-led group of investors, and CVS Pharmacy. The acquisition was completed on June 2, 2006, with the Cerberus-led group (who also included Kimco Realty Corporation, Schottenstein Stores Corp., Lubert-Adler Partners, and Klaff Realty). They held Albertsons LLC as &quot;AB Acquisition LLC&quot;. Albertsons LLC included 661 stores and the distribution centers and offices from five of Albertsons divisions. These five divisions were thought to be Albertsons&#x27; five weakest divisions, and conventional wisdom in the industry was that the stores would eventually be closed or sold to other operators.

As of June 2, 2006, the company&#x27;s retail stores were divided as follows:
* SuperValu had acquired 1,124 stores in the deal, including:
** ACME (134 locations)
** ACME Express, Jewel Express, and Albertsons Express (107 fuel centers)
** Albertsons (564 locations in Southern California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) – New Albertsons Inc. (later sold to Albertsons LLC)
** Bristol Farms (11 locations)
** Jewel and Jewel-Osco (198 locations)
** Lazy Acres (1 location)
** Max Foods (4 locations) (3 converted into Lucky, 1 became Albertsons in July 2006)
** Osco Pharmacy and Sav-on Pharmacy (906 in-store pharmacies)
** Save-A-Lot (2 stores franchised by Shaw&#x27;s)
** Shaw&#x27;s (169 locations)
** Star Market (20 locations)
** Distribution centers (11 centers)
* CVS acquired all (approximately 702) of the stand-alone Osco Drug and Sav-on Drugs rebranding them all as CVS Pharmacy, though they closed approximately 100 of the acquired stores. Many CVS locations were close to Sav-on stores. CVS also acquired one distribution center.
* The Cerberus-led Albertsons LLC retained:
** Albertsons (655 locations in Arizona, Northern California, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming – Albertsons LLC)
** County Line Liquors (1 location)
** Grocery Warehouse (1 location)
** Jewel-Osco (2 locations)
** Max Foods (2 locations)
** Super Saver Foods (23 locations, 21 closed in late 2006)

Following the sale, Albertson&#x27;s, Inc., was removed from the NYSE. Albertsons LLC was technically the successor company to Albertsons according to SEC filings but it was New Albertsons Inc. that assumed most of the debt, got most of the property, and transitioned Albertsons stock into SuperValu stock.

The five Albertsons Inc. divisions that remained as Albertsons LLC were the Dallas/Fort Worth division (Texas excluding El Paso, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas), the Rocky Mountain division (Colorado, Wyoming excluding Rock Springs and Jackson stores, Nebraska, and South Dakota), the Southwest division (Arizona, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas), the Florida division (Florida), and the Northern California division (northern California excluding Hanford and Tulare stores, and northern Nevada). Albertsons LLC then concentrated on rebuilding market share and its store base in its stronger areas and divesting stores and other property in its weaker areas.

On June 6, 2006, only one week after Albertsons LLC was created, the company announced its intent to close 100 Albertsons stores by August 2006, including all but two Super Saver stores. Those closures were spread across all five divisions. Soon after, the company announced that it would be shutting down its online delivery service on July 21, 2006. To distinguish the two companies, Albertsons LLC created a second website, &quot;AlbertsonsMarket.com&quot;.

===A leaner company===
In November 2006, it was announced that the Northern California division, consisting of stores located in northern California and northern Nevada, would be sold to Save Mart, with the deal closing in late February 2007. The company gradually converted all the stores to its Save Mart banner over summer 2007, except for stores in the San Francisco Bay area, which were rebranded as Lucky. The deal included two Northern California distribution centers. Most of the Albertsons locations had originally been branded as Lucky before Albertson&#x27;s 1998 purchase of American Stores.

Most of the changes in the next six years would downscale the remaining divisions. In the Dallas–Fort Worth division, in 2007, the distribution center was sold and outsourced to Associated Wholesale Grocers, and Albertsons would exit both Oklahoma and Austin. The Oklahoma stores were sold to 
Associated Wholesale Grocers members while the Austin stores were sold to H-E-B. With the closures, only four stores south of the Dallas–Fort Worth area existed in Texas, all of which were closed or sold by December 2011. Additionally, many of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex stores closed during this time, even into 2011.

The Florida division, which was always discontiguous with Albertsons&#x27; main market, suffered a blow in June 2008 when Albertsons LLC entered into an agreement with Lakeland, Florida-based Publix stores to sell 49 Florida Albertsons locations to the chain. This included 15 stores in Northern and Northwest Florida, 30 locations in Central Florida, and four locations in South Florida. The sale was completed in September. In April 2012, the company closed most of its stores in Florida. The Plant City distribution center was sold to Gordon Food Service though the Florida Division continued to be located there. By April 2012, only four stores remained in the entire state of Florida.

The Rocky Mountain division slowly shed stores. By April 2007, there were only 32 stores left in the state of Colorado. In December 2007, SuperValu acquired the eight remaining Wyoming locations from Albertson&#x27;s LLC not already owned by the company. These stores continued to operate under the Albertsons banner. 2008 also brought the sale of Albertsons&#x27; lone South Dakota and Nebraska stores to Nash Finch. In August 2009, the distribution center and division office closed and the 26 remaining stores moved to the Southwest division.

Only the Southwest division was spared the major cuts suffered by the other divisions. On June 12, 2007, Albertsons LLC agreed to acquire all Raley&#x27;s locations in New Mexico. The acquisition includes one closed and eight operating stores in Albuquerque and one store in Taos, thus doubling Albertsons store base in the Albuquerque metro.

In June 2007, Albertson&#x27;s LLC decided to discontinue its Preferred Savings Card Program, choosing instead to offer discounted items to all of its customers. In September 2007, all Albertsons stores in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and Florida markets began collecting their Albertsons Preferred Savings Cards.
==== End of the first generation of Albertsons Express ====
Beginning in 2008, Albertsons began exiting the fuel business, selling 72 of over one hundred Albertsons Express gas stations to Valero Energy, which converted most of them to Corner Store locations. This wouldn&#x27;t be the end though, as many Express stores still remained including Cheyenne, WY. It wouldn&#x27;t be until 2011-2013 that most of the Albertsons Express locations were divested under the Supervalu company. Even then, some locations including Hillsboro still displayed Albertsons Express banners.

===New Albertsons acquisition===
While Albertsons LLC had restored its stores to profitability, SuperValu&#x27;s New Albertsons Inc. had done poorly. While SuperValu did remodel many stores and open a few new stores, New Albertsons had shrunk. Of the 1100+ stores SuperValu acquired in 2006, fewer than 900 remained by 2013. Under SuperValu, Bristol Farms had been sold off, 36 Utah stores were sold to Associated Food Stores (leaving just three traditional Albertsons stores in the state), the Wisconsin Jewel-Osco stores had been sold or closed, as well as the Shaw&#x27;s stores in Connecticut. Additionally, like Albertsons LLC, most of the fuel stations had been shuttered or sold to other operators.

On January 10, 2013, it was announced that SuperValu was selling New Albertsons (Albertsons, ACME, Shaw&#x27;s/Star Market, and Jewel-Osco, though they had previously sold off Bristol Farms in 2010) to Cerberus Capital Management. The deal was closed in March 2013. On February 23, 2013, AB Acquisition announced it would split operations of the newly combined company into eight divisions: Northwestern, Intermountain, Southern California, Southern, Jewel-Osco, ACME, Shaw&#x27;s, and Southwestern, and in March 2013, the deal was officially closed. On paper, Albertsons LLC controlled the Albertsons-branded stores and New Albertsons Inc. controlled ACME, Shaw&#x27;s/Star Market, and Jewel-Osco, but it was operated as one company.

On June 11, 2013, Albertsons announced its plans to merge its duplicate websites, social media accounts and mobile apps onto one of each kind, ending the use of the Albertsons Market branding (though this was never used on store exteriors) and AlbertsonsMarket.com. While its website consolidation appeared to take place as expected, its applications received bad reviews—but the biggest consequence was the mistaken deletion of their previous Facebook page and loss of over 200,000 fans. While no details were given as to the mistake made, Albertsons simply admitted that while attempting to join their Albertsons page with over 200,000 Likes and their Albertsons Market page with over 80,000 Likes, something went wrong resulting in the loss of thousands of Likes and comments.

That same month, Albertsons did away with the Preferred Savings Card in the former SuperValu stores that Albertsons LLC had dispensed with in 2007. The cards briefly continued in Southern California stores before being discontinued in July 2013.

===United Supermarkets acquisition===
On September 9, 2013, the company acquired Lubbock-based supermarket United Supermarkets LLC. On February 4, 2014, the FTC voted 4–0 to approve the deal. The acquisition deal cost Albertsons $385 million and required Albertsons to sell its single stores in the Amarillo, Texas, and Wichita Falls, Texas, markets. The United Supermarkets family brands include Market Street, Amigos, and United Express.

After the deal was finalized, the Albertsons Market brand was revived for Albertsons stores operated by United. The first to be branded as such opened in Alamogordo, New Mexico, in January 2015.

===Safeway acquisition===
On February 19, 2014, Safeway began to explore selling itself, and by February 21, 2014, it was in advanced negotiations with Cerberus Capital Management. On March 6, 2014, Cerberus (parent company of Albertsons) announced it would purchase Safeway for $9.4 billion in a deal expected to close in the 4th quarter of the year.

On July 25, 2014, Safeway stockholders approved the merger with Albertsons.

In December 2014, Albertsons announced that the Haggen Company, a Bellingham, Washington, based grocery chain, was buying 146 Safeway, Albertsons and Vons stores, as required by the antitrust review of the merger.

On January 30, 2015, Albertsons officially acquired Safeway Inc. after being cleared by the FTC, thus giving it control of the Safeway store banners, including Randalls, Tom Thumb, Carrs Safeway, Vons, and Pavilions, plus Safeway&#x27;s 49% share of Casa Ley, a Mexican grocery chain. Following the merger, Albertsons announced the new company would have 14 divisions led by three regional offices.

;East Region
*Acme Division: East Region, existing Acme Markets (based in Malvern, PA).
*Eastern Division: East Region, existing Eastern Division of Safeway (based in Lanham, MD). Includes stores in Maryland and Virginia.
*Jewel-Osco Division: East Region, existing Jewel-Osco (based in Itasca, IL).
*Shaw&#x27;s Division: East Region, existing Shaw&#x27;s/Star Market (based in West Bridgewater, MA).
;North Region
*Denver Division: North Region, existing Safeway Denver division with some Albertsons stores from Intermountain. Includes stores in most of Colorado (except for the Grand Junction stores which are part of Intermountain, and the Durango stores which are part of Southwest), the eastern two-thirds of Wyoming, all of Nebraska and South Dakota, and Farmington, New Mexico.
*Intermountain Division: North Region, most of the existing Albertsons division with some Safeway stores from the Seattle Division. Includes all stores in North Dakota, most of Idaho except for the northern panhandle (which is part of the Seattle Division), most of Utah except for the far southern portion (which is part of the Southwest Division), northeastern Nevada, the western third of Wyoming, and stores in the Grand Junction, Colorado area.
*Northern California Division: North Region, existing Safeway division (based in Pleasanton, California). Includes stores in northern California and northwestern Nevada.
*Portland Division: North Region, existing Safeway Portland division with Albertsons stores from Northwestern in Oregon. Includes the entire state of Oregon except for Ontario, plus Clark County, Washington.
*Seattle Division: North Region, existing Safeway division with some Albertsons stores from Northwestern. Includes all stores in the state of Washington (except Clark County) and in the northern Idaho Panhandle.

;South Region
*Houston Division: South Region, existing Randalls/Tom Thumb division of Safeway, with the inclusion of South&#x27;s Florida stores and southern Louisiana stores. Tom Thumb moved to Southern Division. Includes stores in Houston and Austin-areas and all Louisiana and Florida stores.
*Southern Division: South Region, existing Albertsons South division (based in Fort Worth, Texas) combined with Tom Thumb stores. Includes stores in northeastern Texas, northern Louisiana, and all of Arkansas. 
*Southern California Division: South Region, merged Vons Safeway division (excluding southern Nevada/Las Vegas stores, which became part of the new Southwest Division) with Albertsons division (based in Fullerton, California). Includes stores in southern California.
*Southwest Division: South Region, merged Southwest Safeway and Albertsons divisions (based in Phoenix). Includes all stores in Arizona, southern Nevada, and Utah, most of New Mexico (except for Farmington which is part of the Denver Division and southeastern New Mexico which is part of the United Division), and El Paso, Texas.
*United Division: South Region, existing United division (based in Lubbock). Includes stores in the Texas Panhandle and western Texas (excluding El Paso, which is part of the Southwest Division), and southeastern New Mexico.

===Announcement and postponement of going public and A&amp;P acquisition===
After several months of rumors, the combined operation announced it would go public as Albertsons Companies, Inc. (the new name of AB Acquisition LLC). Albertsons attempted to IPO with the ticker ABS on October 14, 2015, planning to raise as much as $1.7 billion, selling 65.3 million shares with a range of $23 - $26 per share. However, the company postponed the listing due to market conditions, particularly after Wal-Mart warned of more challenged sales earlier that day. Albertsons has reportedly postponed the IPO indefinitely, as of October 2015. All during this time, Albertsons continued to expand, purchasing 70 stores owned by the bankrupt Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (operating under the names of The Food Emporium, A&amp;P, A&amp;P Fresh, Superfresh, and Pathmark), which were quickly reopened as ACME stores after two-day store resets.

===Post-Safeway: Acquisitions, conversions, expansions, and selloffs===
As a result of the Albertsons-Safeway merger, Albertsons began to look to divest some stores in geographies where the merger could cause a high market share. Some of these stores including one Albertsons and three Safeway stores in Wyoming were sold off to Ridley&#x27;s Family Markets.

Also at the time of the Albertsons-Safeway merger, the 18-store Pacific Northwest chain Haggen purchased 146 West Coast Vons, Pavilions, Albertsons, and Safeway locations that had to be sold due to anti-trust concerns, paying $300 million, plus spending $100 million to rebrand the stores. The FTC had hoped this would create a regional competitor for Albertsons. On September 1, 2015, Haggen announced that the company had filed a lawsuit against Albertsons LLC and Albertsons Holdings LLC (&quot;Albertsons&quot;) seeking more than $1 billion in damages. The complaint, which was filed that day in United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleged that following Haggen&#x27;s December 2014 purchase of 146 Albertsons and Safeway stores, Albertsons engaged in &quot;coordinated and systematic efforts to eliminate competition and Haggen as a viable competitor in over 130 local grocery markets in five states&quot;, and &quot;made false representations to both Haggen and the FTC about Albertsons&#x27;s commitment to a seamless transformation of the stores into viable competitors under the Haggen banner&quot;.

A week later Haggen filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and began the process of closing all but a few dozen &#x27;core&#x27; stores in the Pacific Northwest. Albertsons would buy back 33 of the stores being sold at auction. In January 2016, Albertsons settled the lawsuit, agreeing to pay $5.75 million to Haggen, and subsequently reached an agreement to acquire the remaining 29 &#x27;core&#x27; Haggen stores located in Washington and Oregon for $106 million, the deal being approved on March 29, 2016. As part of the deal, 15 stores would still operate under the Haggen banner, with the rest converted to Albertsons locations.

During this time, the Albertsons family experienced further changes. On January 11, 2016, it was announced that the three remaining Albertsons stores in Florida, located in Largo, Altamonte Springs and Oakland Park, would be re-bannered as Safeway; this marked the first time that the Safeway brand would exist on a supermarket operation in Florida. It would also re-align the stores toward the Eastern Division. In 2016, smaller acquisitions included Homedale, Idaho-based Paul&#x27;s Market and Santa Rosa, California-based G&amp;G Supermarkets. Both brands were closed before they were converted into Albertsons and Safeway stores, respectively. Additionally, the United Supermarkets subsidiary acquired seven locations from Sweetwater, Texas-based Lawrence Brothers. These were converted into United Supermarkets or Albertsons Market stores. In late 2016, it was announced that Andronico&#x27;s in the San Francisco area would be acquired as well. These stores would become &quot;Safeway Community Markets&quot; and still hold what made Andronico&#x27;s unique, including chef-prepared items. When the first store reopened in February 2017 under the ownership of the Northern California division, it was still bannered as Andronico&#x27;s due to an issue in obtaining local permits but the other stores were able to reopen as Safeway Community Markets.

On February 17, 2017, the Randalls store in south Katy, Texas, serving the Cinco Ranch area closed. On March 6, 2017, shortly after the Katy Randalls closure, it was announced that the Houston-area distribution center near Cypress, Texas, would be closed and the operations consolidated in the Roanoke, Texas, Tom Thumb distribution center in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex to supply the Houston- and Austin-area stores instead. Also, the Houston Division offices would be folded into the legacy Albertsons&#x27;s South Division offices in Fort Worth. Additionally, the stores in the Albuquerque market were realigned toward the United Supermarkets division.
On September 20, 2017, Albertsons acquired meal kit company Plated for $200 million.

During the time after the Albertsons-Safeway merger, Albertsons was experimenting with different banners, converting many stores to Safeway, including many Colorado Albertsons locations. With this rebranding also came additional closures, such as Centennial, Colorado. Some exceptions include Pueblo and Durango in Colorado, which are owned by a different division.

==== Albertsons Express expansion ====
To start off 2018, Albertsons began to reenter the fuel market, opening a brand new Albertsons Express in Boise, ID at the site of a former Pizza Hut; this also introduced a new concept to the state of Idaho&#x27;s gas stations, where the pumps are chip-credit-card enabled. At least one Albertsons Express from the original generation of Albertson&#x27;s fuel centers located in Hillsboro, Oregon, remained open in the relaunch of Albertsons Express. As of September 2021, there are exactly seven Albertsons Express across America. They are located in Idaho with three sites; and in Louisiana, Nevada, Oregon, and Texas with one site each.

==== Additional acquisitions and closures ====
On February 20, 2018, Albertsons announced plans to acquire Rite Aid, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. In addition to retaining the stand-alone Rite Aid pharmacies, its Osco and Sav-on pharmacies located in Albertsons&#x27;s existing stores were expected to be replaced by Rite Aid pharmacies. On August 8, 2018, Rite Aid announced that the plan had failed to please shareholders and the proposed acquisition would be canceled.

That same year, Albertsons closed several stores across multiple divisions, including all three Safeway stores in Florida. These stores were sold to Publix for an undisclosed price. With the closing, Albertsons officially exited the state, which it had been in since the late 1970s when they acquired their Skaggs Albertsons stores. Additionally, the company divested its share in Casa Ley, selling it to Tenedora CL del Noroeste.

Also that year three new Lucky locations in Utah opened, two in West Valley City and Salt Lake City, replacing the last two Super Saver stores, and one in Tooele, replacing a former Albertsons store.
The next year, a location in West Jordan, Utah, opened, replacing another Albertsons that closed in the late 2000s.

In 2019, Albertsons opened Albertsons Market Street in Meridian, Idaho, a flagship store located in a converted ShopKo store and based on the Market Street brand of United Supermarkets. This became Albertsons&#x27;s largest store at 110,000 square feet and featured a variety of departments exclusive to the store or found rarely in the chain, including an oyster bar, a full bar area, and in-house sausages. Additionally, around the same time, a new Andronico&#x27;s Community Markets opened in Monterey, California, the first new store to be branded as such.

In 2020, Albertsons announced the closing of a distribution center in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, laying off up 520 people. Albertsons said its duties will be shifted to an existing distribution center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which will add up to 300 workers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Albertsons&#x27;s total sales experienced a growth of 27% compared to the previous year. The rise in sales and higher traffic came as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in gross sales of $22.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, the company finally went public in June 2020 after years of delays.
 The potential IPO for the company could be valued at around $19 billion. During the time of going public, one more division change was announced when the Mid-Atlantic Division was created by combining Eastern and ACME Markets, and based out of ACME&#x27;s headquarters in Malvern, PA In October 2020, Albertsons submitted a winning bid for the Kings Food Markets/Balducci&#x27;s chain. These will be merged into the Mid-Atlantic Division.

==== Acquisition by Kroger ====

On October 14, 2022, Kroger announced its intent to merge with Albertsons, with Kroger acquiring all Albertsons shares and divesting some stores to secure regulatory approval. The $24.6 billion transaction was expected to close in early 2024. The announcement was met with criticism due to the potential for monopolies to form in some U.S. cities that have few other grocery chains, as well as food deserts that would form from store closures.

On November 1, 2022, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit in King County Superior Court against Albertsons and Kroger seeking to halt the payment of a $4 billion dividend to Albertsons shareholders. The lawsuit aims to prevent Albertsons from winding down operations and preparing store closures during regulator review of the merger. Other state attorneys general have also investigated the merger according to Reuters. In February 2024, the FTC sued to block the acquisition stating that the deal would negatively impact consumer prices and workers&#x27; wages.

In February 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and attorney generals in eight states filed an anti-trust lawsuit to stop the merger. The case went to trial in August 2024. 

In October 2024, Albertsons settled a lawsuit filed by prosecutors in five California counties. The allegations include price overcharging and false weight advertising.

In December 2024, &quot;a federal court issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday against the proposed merger of grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons, siding with the Biden administration. … The $25 billion deal would have merged the country&#x27;s second and fourth-largest grocers by market share, with Kroger trailing only Walmart and Albertsons sitting behind Costco.&quot;

On December 11, 2024, Albertsons Companies, Inc. announced the termination of its merger agreement with Kroger. This decision followed injunctions issued 
by the U.S. District Court in Oregon and the King County Superior Court for the State of Washington, which blocked the proposed $25 billion merger. In response to the failed merger, Albertsons filed a lawsuit against Kroger in the Delaware Court of Chancery, alleging willful breach of contract and seeking billions of dollars in damages. The termination entitled Albertsons to an immediate $600 million termination fee and removed contractual constraints on pursuing other strategic opportunities. Following these events, Albertsons announced plans to accelerate its &quot;Customers for Life&quot; strategy, increase its quarterly cash dividend by 25%, and authorize a $2 billion share repurchase program.

==Brands==

Albertsons once owned several store brands (&quot;private label&quot; brands), often bearing the name of the chain sold under, e.g. &quot;Jewel&quot; brand products in the Jewel and Jewel-Osco locations. Other Albertsons brands over the years have included &quot;A+&quot;, &quot;Good Day&quot;, &quot;Janet Lee&quot; (named after the executive vice-president&#x27;s daughter), &quot;Master&#x27;s Choice&quot;, and &quot;Village Market&quot;. The drug store brands (used for health and beauty aids, over-the-counter medications, and intimate paper goods) were consolidated under the name &quot;Equaline&quot;, rather than the previous &quot;Sav-On Osco by Albertsons&quot; brand. Albertsons introduced an upscale private label brand, &quot;Essensia&quot;, in 2003, which was later renamed by SuperValu as Culinary Circle.

Store brand items in Albertsons stores included Albertsons (national brand quality food), Arctic Shores (frozen seafood), Baby Basics (diapers and infant care items), Culinary Circle (&quot;gourmet&quot; foods and ready-made meals), Equaline (health and beauty products), Farm Fresh (fresh produce), Flavorite (national brand quality foods, used throughout Supervalu stores), Homelife (national brand quality non-foods), Java Delight (coffee), Shoppers Value (value-priced items), Stockman &amp; Dakota (high-quality beef), Stone Ridge (ice cream and sherbet), Super Chill (soft drinks and mixers), Whole Care Pet (pet foods and supplies), and Wild Harvest (natural and organic foods). In 2011, SuperValu announced it would eliminate Flavorite and all brands named after the chains it operates (such as Albertsons, Jewel, and Shaw&#x27;s) and would replace those labels with a new label, Essential Everyday.

After its purchase of Safeway, Albertsons began replacing some of its brands with Safeway&#x27;s. O Organics and Open Nature replaced Wild Harvest, Pantry Essentials replaced Shoppers Value, and Refreshe replaced Super Chill. By late 2015, the remaining store brands were replaced with &quot;Signature&quot; (formerly Safeway Care, Farms, Home, and Kitchens). Albertsons started selling Lucerne dairy products, Mom To Mom baby products, and Priority Pet Food as well.

Albertsons Companies line of Own Brands products launches 1,100 brand new items a year, making it one of the most diverse in-house brands in the country.

<text>Jewel-Osco is a regional supermarket chain in the Chicago metropolitan area, headquartered in Itasca, a western suburb. In 2007, the company had 188 stores across northern, central, and western Illinois; eastern Iowa; and portions of northwest Indiana. Jewel-Osco has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Boise-based Albertsons since 1999. The company originally started as a door-to-door coffee delivery service before it expanded into delivering non-perishable groceries and later into grocery stores, and supermarkets. Prior to its 1984 acquisition by American Stores, Jewel evolved into a large multi-state holding company that operated several supermarket chains and other non-food retail chain stores located from coast to coast and had operated under several different brand names.

==History==

===Beginnings with home deliveries===
In 1899, Frank Vernon Skiff founded Jewel in Chicago as a door-to-door coffee delivery service. In 1902, Skiff partnered with his brother-in-law Frank P. Ross, renaming the venture the Jewel Tea Company. By 1903, they had six routes, then 12 routes in 1904 with expansion into Michigan City, Kankakee, and Kewanee. There were 850 routes by 1915. In the early 1900s, it ran a &quot;coffee train&quot; of 40 cars carrying coffee beans exported from South America.

During WWI, the company faced soaring costs for materials and production. Compounding this, the US government commandeered a key Jewel production facility. As a result, by 1919 the company was experiencing severe financial setbacks. Within a few years, it returned to profitability through the leadership of new company officials: retired Commanders John M. Hancock and Maurice H. Karker, who had both gained extensive logistics experience as US Navy supply officers during the war.

In 1929, the company built a new office, warehouse, and coffee roasting facility in suburban Barrington, Illinois, creating hundreds of local jobs despite the Great Depression. The Barrington location served as the headquarters and main warehouse facility for both the home delivery and food store divisions until the completion of the new warehouse and office complex at Melrose Park in 1953.

In 1949, deliveries were provided on 1876 routes in 43 states to customers mostly in small towns. Customers in cities could visit 154 company-owned grocery stores.

Later, the service expanded to include 350 grocery and 10,000 general merchandise items by 1981 when Jewel sold its &quot;Jewel Home Shopping Service&quot; division to its employees and divest itself from its roots. At the time of the divestiture, the division provided service to customers in mostly small towns located along 1000 routes in 42 states. The division became a 700-member owned cooperative called &quot;J.T.&#x27;s General Store&quot; in which route sales persons were independent agents.

In October 1994, a group of the company&#x27;s managers acquired the assets of &quot;J.T.&#x27;s General Store&quot; and &quot;created J.T. Dealers Sales and Service&quot;. By 1995, &quot;J.T. Dealer Sales and Service&quot; was providing service to 60,000 customers along 250 routes in 35 states.

===Grocery stores===
The company&#x27;s expansion continued throughout the mid-20th century. In 1932, Jewel acquired the Chicago unit of the Canadian firm Loblaw Groceterias, Inc., then a chain of 77 self-service stores, as well as four Chicago grocery stores operated by the Middle West Stores Company, and began operating them under the name Jewel Food Stores. In 1934, Jewel Food Stores merged with Jewel Tea Company. In 1937, Jewel Tea Company purchased an eight-story building in Chicago&#x27;s Central Manufacturing District, which served as Jewel Food Stores&#x27; headquarters until 1954.

The name of the parent company remained &quot;Jewel Tea Company&quot; until 1967 when the stockholders voted to change the name to Jewel Companies, Inc. to better reflect the expansion of the company into different markets. In 1967, the company went public and its stock was traded on the Midwest Stock Exchange.

===Eisner acquisition and expansion south===
In 1957, Jewel acquired the Champaign-based Eisner Food Stores, located in downstate Illinois and later in west central Indiana (Lafayette, West Lafayette, and Bloomington). This acquisition was significant since it was the first time Jewel maintained the new acquisition as a separate division within the Jewel organization with the acquired stores keeping their original names, setting the pattern for future acquisitions.

After Jewel&#x27;s hostile takeover by American Stores in 1984, American Stores decided to save money by merging Eisner directly into Jewel, converting all stores to the Jewel name and slowly started to sell off the former Eisner properties. One of the first properties to let go was the former Eisner warehouse facility in Champaign in 1986. With the Champaign warehouse facility gone, many former Eisner locations became less profitable since they had to be serviced from the more distant Jewel warehouse at Melrose Park, justifying the elimination of those locations. The west central Indiana stores, three in Lafayette and two in Bloomington, were sold off in 1990. Jewel also closed central Illinois locations that were formerly Eisner in Decatur (in 1995), Champaign-Urbana (in 1998), and Springfield (2006).

===Non-food retail expansion===
In 1961, Jewel acquired two growing non-food related retail chains, Chicago-based Osco Drug stores, and Brighton, Massachusetts-based Turn Style discount department stores, to complement their food store division when building one-stop shopping destinations, such as the new Family Centers and Jewel-Osco (Eisner-Osco, Star-Osco, Buttrey-Osco) food-drug combinations. The acquisition of both Osco and Turn Style allowed Jewel to expand into non-food related retailing that would complement their existing food retailing business and also to expand the geographic range of its main food distribution business since the non-food companies had a different geographical footprint.

Jewel expanded into the home improvement retail market by acquiring Republic Lumber in 1972.

===1960s–1970s expansion===
During the 1960s, Jewel expanded by acquiring several chains.

Jewel expanded their food store holdings by acquiring Cambridge-based Star Market in 1964 and the Great Falls-based Buttrey Food Stores in 1966 to add to their existing Jewel and Eisner food store chains.

The acquisition of Star Market also gave Jewel control of Brigham&#x27;s Ice Cream, which had been a part of Star since 1961. Jewel later sold off Brigham&#x27;s in 1982.

In 1965, Jewel expanded into the convenience store business by opening Kwik Shoppe, a chain that was quickly renamed White Hen Pantry within a few months.

Before 1970 Jewel stores were typically located on arterial city streets. Between 1970 and 1990, Jewel moved or expanded most of its stores to be freestanding buildings with ample parking. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Jewel built and operated many Jewel-Osco side-by-side stores, but most construction after 1983 consolidated Jewel and Osco stores together as one large store under one roof. Today, the two stores present to the customer as one unit. For instance, a customer can check out any items at Jewel or Osco registers, find Jewel and Osco merchandise commingled throughout the store, and can call one telephone number to reach their Jewel-Osco. Each operating unit retains its own public identity as a &quot;food store&quot; or a &quot;drug store&quot;.

The first Jewel-Osco food-drug combination stores were built in 1962. The first Jewel-Osco Family Center was opened in Chicago&#x27;s Appleton Plaza Shopping center in January 1962.

Jewel opened five stores in Michigan in the 1970s, but closed all five in 1996.

In 1971, Jewel expanded their brand into Wisconsin by acquiring eight failing stores from Kroger and rebranded the stores Jewel. After a decade of operations, Jewel closed all their stores in Wisconsin in 1980. Those locations were sold to Sentry Foods. Jewel did not return to Wisconsin until 1995.

Until 2010, Jewel and Osco stores under the same roof have had separate operations, managers, ordering and receiving procedures, budgets and employees. A 2010 cost-saving measure brought both Jewel and Osco oversight under one store director for each site.

In 1978, Jewel Companies, Inc. attempted to acquire Skaggs Companies, Inc. through an exchange in stock in which Jewel would have been the surviving company and still based in Melrose Park instead of Salt Lake City. A few months later, Skaggs turned down the merger offer. At that time, Skaggs had 229 stores.

After six years, Jewel suffered many losses due to failed marketing concepts and general mismanagement while Skaggs became larger and strong enough to perform a hostile take over of Jewel under its new name: American Stores.

===American Stores===

American Stores made an offer to acquire the Jewel Companies in 1984. The Jewel Companies, Inc. chairman Weston Christopherson was opposed to a merger and Sam Skaggs subsequently engineered a hostile takeover. On June 1, 1984, American Stores tendered an offer worth $1.1 billion for 67% of Jewel&#x27;s outstanding shares at $70 per share.

For two weeks, Jewel&#x27;s management refused to comment on the offer, maintaining its silence even at a stormy shareholder&#x27;s meeting before which Jewel shareholder groups controlling 20% of the company&#x27;s stock were in favor of negotiating with American Stores. On June 14, Sam Skaggs and Jewel president Richard Cline reached an agreement after an all-night bargaining session. American Stores raised its bid for Jewel&#x27;s preferred stock, increasing the total bid to $1.15 billion in cash and securities. In return, Jewel dropped plans for a defensive acquisition of Household International Inc. (parent company of California supermarket chain Vons) and accepted American Stores&#x27; offer. American Stores soon sold Buttrey Food Stores (in 1990), Star Market (in 1994), and White Hen Pantry (in 1985), to pay off debt and for other reasons.

====1990s expansion under American Stores====
In 1989, American Stores expanded to Florida using the Jewel-Osco name, but operating as a separate division distinct from the Midwestern Jewel-Osco operations. The Jewel name returned to Florida five years after the company closed all of its Jewel-T discount food stores in 1984. Florida was considered a good market for Jewel because of the high number of Chicagoans who had relocated to that state. After three years of operations, American Stores closed those Jewel-Osco stores and sold them to Albertsons in 1992.

To consolidate the names of some of its subsidiaries under one title with nationwide recognition, American Stores renamed some of its Skaggs-Alpha Beta stores to Jewel-Osco in mid-September 1991. American replaced the Skaggs-Alpha Beta name with that of Jewel-Osco on all 76 stores in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arkansas, expanding the chain toward the southwestern states. Within six months, American Stores sold all of the Jewel-Osco locations in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Florida to Albertsons but kept the locations in the state of New Mexico for a few more years.

In 1998, American Stores rebranded the Jewel-Osco stores in New Mexico to Lucky/Sav-on, a grocery store/drug store brand which American Stores had used in neighboring Arizona. After the acquisition of American Stores by Albertsons just a few months later, the New Mexico stores were rebranded again to Albertsons Sav-on in 1999.

Under American Stores, Jewel returned to Wisconsin by opening a Jewel-Osco store in a new shopping center in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1995. Jewel returned to Milwaukee in 1998 by purchasing a Pick &#x27;n Save store and four Cub Foods stores and converting them into Jewel Osco stores.

===Albertsons and SuperValu===
Albertsons acquired American Stores&#x27; holdings, including Jewel and Jewel-Osco stores, in 1999.

Seven years later, parent company Albertsons and its stores would be taken over by two separate groups. On May 30, 2006, shareholders approved the break-up of Albertsons. All Jewel-Osco and Jewel Food Stores outside of Springfield, Illinois were now wholly owned by SuperValu. The Springfield stores were acquired by an investment group led by Cerberus Capital Management. Both of those have since been sold to Niemann Foods, an independent operator of grocery stores, supermarkets and convenience stores in Central Illinois which now operates them under the County Market brand. All free-standing Osco drugstores are now owned by CVS Pharmacy. The Osco name is still used for pharmacies within Albertsons, Jewel, Shaw&#x27;s and Star Market.

SuperValu announced on January 5, 2007, that it would offer for sale its Jewel-Osco stores in the Milwaukee area. Pick &#x27;n Save agreed to take 5 of the 15 stores. Two other stores were purchased by Lena&#x27;s Food Market. SuperValu announced to its workers that the remaining stores, if unsold, would close at the end of March.

In 2008, the headquarters for the Illinois-based Jewel-Osco division was moved from Melrose Park to Itasca.

===Jewel Express===
In 1997, Albertsons added gas pumps and a small convenience store in front of a store in Eagle, Idaho. Since the experiment was successful, Albertsons decided to expand this concept to all stores that would be able to support it and was allowed by local government. The new concept was called Albertsons Express.

After Albertsons acquired American Stores in 1999, Albertsons wanted to expand the Albertsons Express concept to the former American Stores chains. The first Jewel Express was opened in front of a Jewel-Osco in South Elgin in October 2000.

In attempt to increase revenue in 2009, Supervalu enhanced the Express concept by enlarging the convenience store, added more marketing tie ins with the main store and added a car wash. This change did not help Supervalu&#x27;s bottom line so in 2011 Supervalu announced that it was exiting the fuel business and that it would sell or close all fuel stations that it received when it purchased Albertsons which includes the 29 Jewel Express stations that it received. The same announcement said that 27 of the Jewel Express locations would be sold to Alimentation Couche-Tard, the parent of Circle K, and all remaining unsold locations would be closed. Some of these new Circle K locations were paired with the Shell fuel brand.

Not all Jewel Express locations closed or converted to Circle K. Two Expresses, one in East Moline, Illinois and the other in Moline, Illinois continue with the Jewel Express concept.

===Urban Fresh===
In 2008, SuperValu converted one of its closed Sunflower Market stores on Clybourn Avenue to an Urban Fresh by Jewel, a smaller store than the usual Jewel, with more upscale and organic products. This store closed on October 31, 2009, and no other stores were opened under this banner.

===LEED certified===
In October 2008, Jewel-Osco opened its first LEED certified store at Kinzie and Des Plaines in Chicago. This new store was built with recycled materials and recycled 98% of its construction debris. It featured a rooftop garden, used water-saving devices, had non-ozone-depleting refrigerants in cooling equipment, used a refrigerant detection system, and had energy efficient lighting.

===Today===

Jewel-Osco employs more than 45,000 associates. Its customer base gave it a 45% share of the grocery market in Chicago, trailed by the Safeway Inc.-owned Dominick&#x27;s chain (ranking second at 15 percent) before its closure. Consumers from 80% of all households in the Chicago metropolitan area visit a Jewel-Osco store at least once a month.

On January 10, 2013, SuperValu announced the sale of Jewel food stores to Cerberus Capital Management in a $3.3 billion deal. The deal closed on March 21, 2013.

===Acquisition of Strack &amp; Van Til===
On May 15, 2017, Jewel-Osco made a bid to purchase all 19 Strack &amp; Van Til grocery stores for $100 million. The Jewel-Osco bid was ultimately unsuccessful and the stores were sold in the bankruptcy auction to the Strack and Van Til families and the Indiana Grocery Group.

==Past ventures==
Over the years, Jewel has tried other concepts. It is credited with selling the first generic brand product line in 1977. The packaging had no name or pictures—just a list of contents, UPC, and required nutritional information on a white package with a pseudo-army olive-green stripe. The generic line was given the brand &quot;Econo Buy&quot; in the early 1990s.

===Jewel Grand Bazaar===
In 1973, Jewel Companies opened an experimental Jewel Grand Bazaar, on the southwest side of Chicago; a store that encompassed an entire city block at the northwest corner of 54th Street and Pulaski Road. This store featured bulk packaging, free samples on weekends, and 24-hour service. See photos: photos This experimental store was in service from 1973 until the 1980s, when it was reformatted as a standard Jewel-Osco combo store. A second Grand Bazaar was opened in 1974 at 87 W. 87th St in Chicago and in 1977, a &quot;Jewel Grand Bazaar&quot; was opened at 6505 W. Diversey in the Brickyard Mall. A fourth location was opened in Franklin Park in 1975.

During the 1990s, the Diversey Avenue Grand Bazaar was reformatted to a regular Jewel grocery store, but continued to carry some of the traditional &quot;Grand Bazaar&quot; features such as bulk foods. With the reconstruction of the Brickyard Mall in 2003, the Grand Bazaar store was demolished and replaced with a smaller Jewel grocery store. Rockford, Illinois also had a Jewel Grand Bazaar that opened in 1976 and was converted to a non-union Magna store in 1983. That store closed in 1997. There was also one on Grand Ave. and Kostner Ave. on Chicago&#x27;s West side. The last &quot;Grand Bazaar&quot; format store was opened in 1975 at Grand ave. and Mannheim road in Franklin Park, Illinois. This building is currently being operated as a Jewel-Osco. Neither the Chicago Tribune nor the Chicago Sun-Times record when these stores were actually converted or closed.

===Turn Style===

In 1961, Jewel Companies (then Jewel Tea) acquired a chain of discount stores in the Chicago area called Turn Style. This chain was moderately successful throughout the 1960s. Some locations were combined with Jewel&#x27;s supermarket brands to form Family Centers. The first Turn Style Family Center was opened in Racine in March 1962. In 1978, 19 of 22 locations were sold to May Department Stores and converted to the Venture format. Other stores were converted into large Osco Drug Stores.

===Jewel T===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Jewel Companies operated a no-frills grocery chain called Jewel T (phonetically pronounced &quot;Jewel Tea&quot;, as a nod to the former name of the company). The typical store tends to be rather small, 8,000 square feet instead of the typical 30,000 for a full-service supermarket, with a selection rather limited to canned and dry foods and non-perishable with everything sold at a steep discount.

To avoid cannibalizing sales from their existing markets in the Midwest and North East Atlantic States, the first Jewel T location was opened in New Port Richey, Florida, in 1977, quickly followed by 2 other stores in the St. Petersburg area during the same year. Jewel T expanded into Pennsylvania in 1978 and many suburban Philadelphia kids in this gas crisis era remember mom driving the Vega or Pinto out to Jewel T, and bringing back powdered milk, frozen pretzels, and bulk frozen cherry pielettes. They expanded to Atlanta in 1979. Jewel T had approximately 30 stores in two states at the beginning of 1979 and 44 stores in four states by the following June.

By the end of 1979, Jewel T had 87 stores located in the states of Florida, Georgia, Texas, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Alabama. In the first month of 1980, Jewel T opened eight stores in highly competitive Southern California. In 1981, Jewel T opened stores in Atlanta and its 150th store in Louisiana.

At its height in 1981, Jewel T operated 150 stores in 10 states located mainly in the Mid-Atlantic, South East, the Gulf Coast, the Deep South and Southern California. At the same time it encountered problems competing against the full service supermarkets which fought back by dropping prices, in some cases at or below costs, on the same limited items that Jewel T and other discount food stores specialized in stocking. Within a few years, the company began to sell unprofitable locations. By the beginning of 1984, approximately 131 locations remained.

In March 1984, the company closed all 21 Jewel T stores in Southern California. Seven of the leases and most of the inventory was sold to the 99 Cents Only Stores.

A few months later, 105 stores remained when the chain was finally sold off in two separate transactions in June 1984, 28 stores in Texas were sold to a group of managers while the other 77 stores in Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey were sold to Save-A-Lot.

===Republic Lumber===
Jewel Companies expanded into the hardware and home improvement business by acquiring Republic Lumber in 1972. In 1979, Jewel, under the Osco division, sold four of its five Republic Lumber locations to R &amp; L Lumber, parent company of Handy Andy Home Improvement Center, and closed the fifth. They were located on the west side of Chicago at 4052 W. Grand Ave (a former Jewel opened in 1957 to celebrate the chain&#x27;s 25th anniversary), Oak Lawn, Arlington Heights and Chicago Heights. A fifth location in Norridge was closed early in 1979 when the lease was not renewed, which later became a Joseph Lumber location.

==President&#x27;s Choice house brand==
While as a subsidiary division of American Stores, Jewel-Osco began offering the Canadian staple President&#x27;s Choice branded products in 1992. President&#x27;s Choice is a house brand created and distributed by Loblaw Companies Limited of Toronto, Ontario. Loblaw makes extra money by offering their President&#x27;s Choice to other retailers who do not compete in their home marketing areas. Under American Stores&#x27; marketing agreement with Loblaw, American Stores were the exclusive distributor of the President&#x27;s Choice brand within each American Stores, marketing area. The marketing agreement between Jewel and Loblaw ceased when Albertsons acquired American Stores. In 2011, Supervalu replaced the house brand at Jewel with their own Culinary Circle and Wild Harvest private label brands.

==Organizational philosophy==
A 1972 book written by Jewel senior leaders, &quot;The Jewel Concepts,&quot; stressed good citizenship within the community, &quot;watching the horizon&quot;, and sponsorship of young people.

In an Illinois Retail Merchants Association online article, retired Jewel-Osco chairman Don Perkins reflects, &quot;Jewel has a tradition of people orientation.&quot; One of these traditions came in the form of the &quot;first assistant&quot; philosophy of management. Each higher-level manager was to see himself or herself as &quot;serving&quot; the employees he or she managed. On the store level, this would mean that the manager would be the &quot;first assistant&quot; to the employees by making personal contact and taking personal interest, solving problems, suggesting solutions, and using flexibility in order to best serve the employees&#x27; concerns. Then the floor employees&#x27; duty was to be in service as the &quot;first assistant&quot; to the customers.

Jewel also was progressive in creating partnerships with vendors, at a time when the practice was rare.

<text>Osco Drug and Sav-on Drugs were the names of a pair of chain pharmacies that operated in the United States. Osco Drug was founded by the Skaggs family. Alpha Beta grocery store was purchased by American Stores in 1961. Skaggs Drug Centers bought American Stores in 1979 and assumed the American Stores name. Sav-on Drugs was a California-based pharmacy chain that was acquired by Osco&#x27;s parent company in 1980. Both Osco and Sav-on stores eventually came under the ownership of American Stores, then Albertsons, and finally SuperValu before the stores were sold off.

The Osco and Sav-on brands survive today as brandings for in-store pharmacies in the Albertsons chain of stores. Osco pharmacies can be found in Jewel stores, which are co-branded Jewel-Osco, as well as in Shaw&#x27;s and Star Markets. Sav-on pharmacies are found largely in Acme stores. Pharmacies in Albertsons stores are called Osco in Arizona and Montana stores, and Sav-On in other markets, in Nevada and predominantly in Texas for example.

== History ==
===Roots===

In 1915, S.M. Skaggs, a Baptist minister, opened a grocery store in American Falls, Idaho, with lower prices on goods. In 1917, O.P Skaggs started a chain of self-service stores, and later sold the franchise in the western states to Christian Call. In 1926, the Skaggs brothers merged the chain with Sam Seelig stores, which had become Safeway in 1925. L.J. Skaggs retired from Safeway in 1932, and in 1934, he opened the first self-service drugstore in the US in Tacoma, Washington.

=== First store ===

Loronzo L. (L.L.) Skaggs owned a controlling stock in a company called Quality Food in Minnesota and subsequently left the Safeway business. L.L. opened a chain of self-service drugstores in the Midwest similar to his brother L.J.&#x27;s stores in the west. The first store opened in 1937 in Rochester, Minnesota, and was named &quot;Pay-Less&quot; (different from the drug chain Payless founded later in the century), and was managed by George Hilden. The store remained in operation until 1987, when it closed due to redevelopment in downtown Rochester.

In 1937, while in the process of opening a second store in Mason City, Iowa, it was learned that another company had already registered the name &quot;Payless&quot; in the state. L.L changed &quot;Payless&quot; to &quot;Self-Service Drug, Inc.&quot; and formed a new corporation.

=== Name change to Osco===

In 1942, the corporation &quot;Self-Service Drug, Inc.&quot; was dissolved and succeeded by &quot;Owners Service Company&quot;, a partnership of L.L Skaggs, H.B. Finch, Paul Stratton and George Hilden. From this company &#x27;Osco&#x27; was coined. That year Osco moved its headquarters from Waterloo, Iowa, to the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, Illinois.

==Sav-on Drugs==

Sav-on Drugs was a Southern California-based drugstore chain that was founded by Christian J. Call in San Bernardino, in July 1945. Ira D. Brown served as general manager. The chain was the second largest California-based drugstore chain in Southern California at the time it was acquired by The Jewel Companies in November 1980.

In October 1947, the third store in the chain opened in Long Beach. The store was managed by Ronald L. Call while the chain was co-owned at that time by Christian J. Call and Alton D. Clark

The seventh store was opened in South Gate in September 1948.

In June 1952, the ninth store opened in Lakewood.

The tenth store of the chain opened in Gardena in October 1952.

Founder and president Christian Call died on January 11, 1958. He was replaced by his nephew Ronald Call.

The 27th store was opened in the North Hills Shopping Center in Granada Hills in July 1959.

The 35th store in the chain was opened in the Park Western Shopping Center in San Pedro in September 1963.

The United States Department of Justice filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Sav-On&#x27;s rival Thrifty Drug Stores in Federal Court in August 1962 to force Thrift to divest itself of its 28.75% stock it owns in Sav-On Drugs, Inc. In December 1964, Thrifty Drug Stores sold its almost 30% stake in its rival Sav-On back to Sav-On that it had acquired since 1958.

The company&#x27;s general offices was moved from downtown Los Angeles to a new building in Marina del Rey in 1967.

The company&#x27;s second president, Ronald L. Call, died in March 1968 and was replaced by Ira Brown.

Sav-on opened its 64th store in Torrance in July 1971.

In November 1972, Sav-On Drugs stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SVN.

The 77th store was opened in Marina del Rey in January 1974.

Sav-on opened its 98th store in Carson in October 1975. Except for four stores in Houston, Texas, the other 94 stores were located in California.

The 100th store was opened in Santa Clarita in December 1975.

Sav-On purchased the inventories, fixtures, leasehold improvements, and other assets for 15 Pay Less Drug Stores in Southern California from the Oakland-based Pay Less in March 1978. The new stores were mostly located in Orange and San Diego counties. Sav-On had 112 stores prior to the sale and 127 after including the former Pay Less stores. All 127 stores were located in Southern California except for five in Houston, Texas. The chain also had plans of opening stores in Las Vegas, Nevada, in the near future.

In 1978, Sav-On acquired a warehouse in Anaheim in which the company remodel it to be a new warehouse distribution site and also as the site of its new corporate headquarters to replace it previous offices in Marina del Rey.

By August 1980, the Sav-on had a total of 141 stores, which includes 130 in California, 6 in Houston, and 5 in Las Vegas.

In October 1980, Sav-on opened its 146th store in Orange.

Sav-on opened its 148th store in the South Gate Shopping Center Plaza in South Gate, in June 1981.

==Acquisitions==

===The Jewel Companies, Inc.===
In 1961, The Jewel Companies, Inc. acquired the 30 Osco Drug stores in six Midwest states. In 1962, Osco&#x27;s headquarters was moved from Chicago&#x27;s Merchandise Mart to Melrose Park, Illinois, and the first side-by-side &quot;Jewel-Osco&quot; store opened. The early Jewel-Osco combination (combo) stores were two individual stores, separated by an interior wall (and in some locations, a half-wall), allowing a customer to go back and forth between each store without having to go outside. The first Jewel-Osco Family Center was opened in Chicago&#x27;s Appleton Plaza Shopping center in January 1962.

The first Eisner-Osco Family Center was opened in West Lafayette, Indiana, in September 1970.

The first Osco Drug store to open adjacent to an existing Buttrey Food store occurred in Anaconda, Montana, in July 1967. The first example of a purpose-built Buttrey-Osco Family Center occurred with the opening in Boise in September 1969.

The first Star-Osco Family Center opened in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 1970.

After the merger, all of Jewel&#x27;s subsidiaries soon had an Osco Drug. Some Eisner Food Stores locations were re-branded &quot;Eisner-Osco&quot;. When Jewel acquired Star Market in 1964, the first Osco Drug in New England was opened, and some were next to Star Market locations and were branded as &quot;Star-Osco&quot;. By 1968, Osco grew to 168 stores in sixteen states. During most of the 1960s, Osco operated as two divisions – &#x27;City Osco&#x27;, comprising the Chicago, Illinois, and Chicago suburb stores and &#x27;Country Osco&#x27; (all the other Oscos). These two divisions were combined in 1968 and formed Osco Drug, Inc. Also in 1968, Osco&#x27;s headquarters relocated from Melrose Park, Illinois to Franklin Park, Illinois. Later that year, the Jewel Imports procurement group was established to import a broad range of general merchandise from around the world to sell in Osco stores.

When The Jewel Companies Inc. acquired Buttrey Food Stores in 1966, many of the stores were converted to a combination store format and bannered as &quot;Buttrey-Osco&quot; with common checkout stands but separate store management, all under one roof. By the early 1980s, Buttrey eventually operated 60 stores in Montana, North and South Dakota, western Minnesota, Wyoming, eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, Utah, and Idaho. Stores were spread thinly over a wide territory.

Outside of the Chicago metropolitan area, Osco operated stand-alone pharmacies (or free standing stores). In the early years, many of the Jewel and Osco combination stores maintained different operating hours from one another and on certain days such as holidays, one side of the combo store would be open, while the other would be closed. By the early 1980s, new and remodeled combo stores had the &#x27;wall&#x27; removed and the store became one, and to this day, Osco retains control over drug, general merchandise, pharmacy and liquor departments in the Jewel Osco combo stores.

In the late 1960s, Osco was seeking to purchase or build a photofinishing plant to service its stores. At the time, the company was using outside vendors, and the film developing quality and service was inconsistent. In 1970, working with Kodak, Osco built a photofinishing lab in Elgin, Illinois. The facility, Crest Photo Lab opened in 1971, and serviced Osco&#x27;s Chicago, Central and Eastern region stores. The Elgin photo lab expanded several times over the years. As both Osco and its photofinishing market share grew, three more photo plants were added: Alves Photo Service Braintree, Massachusetts, in 1980, Rich Photo Lab Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1984 and Drewry Photocolor Burbank, California, in 1987 (renamed Crest Photo in 1988). The photo labs were sold to Kodak&#x27;s Qualex photo processing division in 1996, prompted by the emergence of in-store one-hour photo labs and digital photography technology.

In 1974, Osco&#x27;s headquarters were relocated from Franklin Park, Illinois, to a new facility at 1818 Swift Drive in Oak Brook, Illinois.

==== Acquisition of Sav-on Drugs ====
In November 1980, The Jewel Companies Inc. purchased Sav-on Drugs, Inc. which was headquartered in Anaheim, California, and had 150 stores in California, Nevada and Texas. The Sav-on chain became Osco&#x27;s &#x27;Western Region&#x27;.

===American Stores Company ===
In 1984, American Stores Company, which consisted of Alpha Beta, Acme Markets, and Skaggs, acquired The Jewel Companies Inc.

====American Drug Stores, Inc.====
In 1989, a new subsidiary, American Drug Stores, Inc., was formed and consisted of American Stores drugstore holdings of Osco Drug, Sav-on Drugs, the Osco side of the Jewel-Osco food-drug combination stores and RxAmerica. RxAmerica began earlier in 1989 as a mail service prescription fulfillment center with a facility in Salt Lake City, Utah.

====Sav-on re-branding and relaunching====
American Stores had a strategy to build a nationwide network of pharmacies, streamline operations and advertising to gain national recognition for the brand, especially for the high-margin private label products. The name Osco Drug was chosen as the national chain banner because of the large number of stores which already had that name and existed in various parts of the US. The name change was completed for the &quot;Skaggs&quot; drugstores in 1985 and then for the &quot;Sav-on&quot; stores in 1986. The name &quot;Osco&quot; did not resonate well with &quot;Sav-on&#x27;s&quot; Southern California customer base. American Stores eventually made the decision to change the name of the former &quot;Sav-on&quot; stores back to Sav-on Drugs. Rumors circulated at the time claiming that the reason for the name change back to &quot;Sav-on&quot; was due to &quot;Osco&quot; having the same pronunciation as the Spanish word (oss-ko), which means &quot;nausea&quot; or &quot;disgust&quot;, a considerable factor within Southern California&#x27;s heavily Hispanic market. This explanation for the name change was refuted by American Stores.

The name change on all stores was completed in 1989, and the Sav-on Drugs brand was re-launched in Southern California and Nevada.

====Sav-on Express, Reliable Drug, Clark Drug====

At the same time that the company was making major divestments in the early 1990s, American Stores also looked for opportunities to make strategic minor acquisitions that would enhance its position in the main markets where it needed to strengthen market share.
* The company&#x27;s California drugstore operations were enhanced through the early 1992 $60 million purchase of 85 CVS Stores (63 CVS Pharmacy drugstores and the rights to operate 22 CVS health and beauty aid stores) from the Melville Corporation. These stores converted to the Sav-on Drugs and Sav-on Express banners. Later that year, 30 Thrifty and &quot;Rx Plus&quot; drugstores in Arizona and Nevada were acquired.
* The following year Reliable Drug (a 55 unit chain) in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri was bought. These stores were soon re-bannered as Osco Drug stores.
* In February 1995, American Stores spent about $37 million for 17 Clark Drug stores in southern California, which were then converted to the Sav-on Drugs name.

====Consolidation of operations====

In 1992, American Stores shifted its strategy from that of a holding company to a centralized operating company. As a result of the decision, common functions among American Stores&#x27; operating divisions (procurement, distribution logistics, payroll, human resources, etc.) were removed from the operating divisions, consolidated and run centrally. From 1992 through 1998, American Stores consolidated operations and moved responsibilities of their division offices to their headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. Although &#x27;American Stores&#x27; food divisions retained an operating presence in their geographical locations and other centralized marketing, merchandising and other staff functions were relocated between 1992 and 1998 from Oak Brook, Illinois, to Salt Lake City to occupy the then-new American Stores Tower. Pharmacy operations were relocated to Scottsdale Arizona with certain pharmacy systems-related resources continuing to operate from the Chicago area after being relocated to 3030 Cullerton Drive in Franklin Park, Illinois.

After American Drug Stores&#x27; move to Salt Lake City, Utah, was complete in 1998, Osco&#x27;s Oak Brook, Illinois, 1818 Swift Drive headquarters was sold to the Follett Corporation.

====Osco Foodmarts====

In 1994, American Stores converted 25 Jewel Food Stores in Chicago, Illinois, to Osco Drug free-standing stores. These older and smaller Jewel stand-alone stores were closed so that American Stores could focus on the combination formats only for Jewel and to expand Osco&#x27;s presence in Chicago as a response to Walgreens increasing market dominance. The Osco stores replacing the Jewel stores contained expanded food and produce presentations and were coined &#x27;Osco Foodmarts&#x27;.

====Health &#x27;n&#x27; Home====

To extend its core drugstore business, in November 1995 American Drug Stores launched a new format called Health &#x27;n&#x27; Home, which was a , 18,000-item home health care superstore. The first Health &#x27;n&#x27; Home opened in Phoenix, Arizona, and by late 1997 there were 20 Health &#x27;n&#x27; Home stores in four states.

====RxAmerica====

In 1998, American Stores RxAmerica division and Longs Drug Stores Integrated Health Concepts (IHC) division agreed to merge their Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) ventures. Under terms of the joint venture, RxAmerica and its former corporate partner, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, parted ways, and RxAmerica combined with Longs&#x27; IHC division in a 50/50 partnership. The alliance created a national PBM of nearly 1,400 Longs and American Stores pharmacy outlets and a nationwide network of 40,000 pharmacies serving some 3 million patients under contract. Longs and Albertsons remained equal partners up though 2001, when Albertsons sold their 50% interest to Longs.

==Albertsons, Inc.==


During 1999, the drugstore operations division and general merchandise procurement functions were moved from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Scottsdale, Arizona, operating as &quot;Albertsons Drug Region&quot;.

In 2002, Albertsons sold its 84 free-standing Osco Drug stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine to the Jean Coutu Group, a Canadian drugstore company. Jean Coutu re-branded the acquired Osco stores as Brooks Pharmacy. Also in 2002, Albertsons, due to financial difficulties, closed several of its stores across the country including all stores in the Des Moines, Iowa, metro market.

In March 2005, Albertsons re-introduced the Osco brand name to the New England region by way of its Shaw&#x27;s and Star Market pharmacies.

==SuperValu, CVS Corporation, and Cerberus==

On June 2, 2006, the sale of Albertsons essentially split the company into three parts.

* CVS Corporation purchased the 700 free-standing drug stores (Osco Drug and Sav-on Drugs). By 2007, these stores were rebranded as CVS Pharmacy.
* A Cerberus-led group of investors (who included Kimco Realty Corporation, Schottenstein Stores Corp., Lubert-Adler Partners, and Klaff Realty) purchased the Albertsons stores in Northern California, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Arizona, and New Mexico forming a new company called Albertsons LLC. Many of these stores have since been sold to other grocery chains or closed altogether.
* SuperValu purchased the Jewel, ACME, Shaw&#x27;s divisions and the remaining Albertsons stores not acquired by Cerberus. SuperValu retains the Osco and Sav-on drug trademarks allowing the pharmacies in their grocery stores to remain branded as Sav-on Pharmacy or Osco Pharmacy.

The SuperValu owned Albertsons stores and the chains it acquired were in turn sold to Cerberus in 2013 and Osco and Sav-On pharmacies moved their operations to the base of Albertsons LLC in Boise, Idaho. Certain store support functions exist in the Franklin Park, Illinois, office.

<text>A supermarket is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections. Strictly speaking, a supermarket is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market. In everyday American English usage, however, &quot;grocery store&quot; is often casually used as a synonym for &quot;supermarket&quot;. The supermarket retail format first appeared around 1930 in the United States as the culmination of almost two decades of retail innovations, and began to spread to other countries after extensive worldwide publicity in 1956. 

The supermarket typically has places for fresh meat, fresh produce, dairy, deli items, baked goods, and similar foodstuffs. Shelf space is also reserved for canned and packaged goods and for various non-food items such as kitchenware, household cleaners, pharmacy products and pet supplies. Some supermarkets also sell other household products that are consumed regularly, such as alcohol (where permitted), medicine, and clothing, and some sell a much wider range of non-food products: DVDs, sporting equipment, board games, and seasonal items (e.g., Christmas wrapping paper, Easter eggs, school uniforms, Valentine&#x27;s Day themed gifts, Mother&#x27;s Day gifts, Father&#x27;s Day gifts and Halloween).

A larger full-service supermarket combined with a department store is sometimes known as a hypermarket. Other services may include those of banks, cafés, childcare centers/creches, insurance (and other financial services), mobile phone sales, photo processing, video rentals, pharmacies, and gas stations. If the eatery in a supermarket is substantial enough, the facility may be called a &quot;grocerant&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;grocery&quot; and &quot;restaurant&quot;.

The traditional supermarket occupies a large amount of floor space, usually on a single level. It is usually situated near a residential area in order to be convenient to consumers. The basic appeal is the availability of a broad selection of goods under a single roof, at relatively low prices. Other advantages include ease of parking and frequently the convenience of shopping hours that extend into the evening or even 24 hours of the day. Supermarkets usually allocate large budgets to advertising, typically through newspapers and television. They also present elaborate in-shop displays of products.

Supermarkets typically are chain stores, supplied by the distribution centers of their parent companies, thus increasing opportunities for economies of scale. Supermarkets usually offer products at relatively low prices by using their buying power to buy goods from manufacturers at lower prices than smaller stores can. They also minimize financing costs by paying for goods at least 30 days after receipt and some extract credit terms of 90 days or more from vendors. Certain products (typically staple foods such as bread, milk and sugar) are very occasionally sold as loss leaders so as to attract shoppers to their store. Supermarkets make up for their low margins by a high volume of sales, and with of higher-margin items bought by the customers. Self-service with shopping carts (trolleys) or baskets reduces labor costs, and many supermarket chains are attempting further reduction by shifting to self-service check-outs.

==History==

===Early history of retail food sales===

Historically, the earliest retailers were peddlers who marketed their wares in the streets, but by the 1920s, retail food sales in the United States had mostly shifted to small corner grocery stores. In that era, the standard retail grocery business model was for a clerk to fetch products from shelves behind the merchant&#x27;s counter while customers waited in front of the counter, indicating the items they wanted. Customers needed to ask because &quot;most stores were designed to keep customers (and their children) away from the food&quot;. Most foods and merchandise did not come in individually wrapped consumer-sized packages, so the clerk had to measure out and wrap the precise amount desired. Merchants did not post prices, which forced customers to haggle and bargain with clerks to reach fair prices for their purchases. Haggling was further complicated by other factors such as the clerk&#x27;s awareness of the customer&#x27;s social status and ability to pay. This business model had already been established in Europe for millennia, with examples of primitive retail stores found as far back as ancient Rome. It offered extensive opportunities for social interaction: many regarded this style of shopping as &quot;a social occasion&quot; and would often &quot;pause for conversations with the staff or other customers&quot;. 

These practices were by nature slow, had high labor intensity, and were quite expensive. The number of customers who could be attended to at one time was limited by the number of staff employed in the store. Early grocery stores were &quot;austere&quot; and tiny by modern standards, with as few as 450 items. Shopping for groceries often involved trips to multiple specialty shops, such as a greengrocer, butcher, bakery, fishmonger and dry goods store, in addition to a general store. Milk and other items of short shelf life were delivered by a milkman. These small retailers were the final links in a &quot;long and tortuous food chain,&quot; as most of them were far too small to deal directly with most of the persons who actually harvested, processed, and distributed all that food. During the 1920s, the highly inefficient nature of the American food distribution system meant that the &quot;average urban family spent fully one-third of its budget on food&quot;. 

One of the most important defining features of the modern supermarket is cheap food. The vast abundance of cheap, wholesome food which modern consumers take for granted today was simply unimaginable before the middle of the 20th century, to the point that the first American supermarket customers in the 1930s were overcome with emotion at the sight of so much cheap food. 

Before the 20th century, food was neither cheap, nor wholesome, nor abundant. For example, in 1812, almost 90 percent of Americans worked in food production, and they struggled to stay alive on food which was often scarce, of poor quality, and riddled with diseases which could and did often kill them.

===Early experiments in building large stores and chain stores===

The concept of an inexpensive food market relying on economies of scale was developed by Vincent Astor, but he was ahead of his time. He founded the Astor Market in 1915, investing $750,000 of his fortune into a 165′ by 125′ (50×38-metre) corner of 95th and Broadway, Manhattan, creating, in effect, an open-air mini-mall that sold meat, fruit, produce and flowers. The expectation was that customers would come from great distances (&quot;miles around&quot;), but in the end, even attracting people from ten blocks away was difficult, and the market folded in 1917.

The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (A&amp;P), which was established in 1859, was an early grocery store chain in Canada and the United States. It became common in North American cities in the 1920s. Early chains like A&amp;P did not sell fresh meats or produce. During the 1920s, to reduce the hassle of visiting multiple stores, U.S. grocery store chains like A&amp;P introduced the combination store. This was a grocery store which combined several departments under one roof, but generally maintained the traditional system of clerks pulling products from shelves on request. By 1929, only one in three U.S. grocery stores was a combination store.

===Self-service grocery stores===

The concept of a self-service grocery store predates the supermarket; it was developed by entrepreneur Clarence Saunders at his Piggly Wiggly stores, the first of which opened in 1916. Saunders was awarded several patents for the ideas he incorporated into his stores. The stores were a financial success and Saunders began to offer franchises.

The general trend since then has been to stock shelves at night so that customers, the following day, can obtain their own goods and bring them to the front of the store to pay for them. Although there is a higher risk of shoplifting, the costs of appropriate security measures ideally will be outweighed by reduced labor costs.

===Birth of the supermarket===

Historically, there has been much debate about the origin of the supermarket. For example, Southern California grocery store chains Alpha Beta and Ralphs both have strong claims to being the first supermarket. By 1930, both chains were already operating multiple self-service grocery stores. However, as of 1930, both chains were not yet true supermarkets in the modern sense because their prices remained quite high; as noted above, one of the most important defining features of the supermarket is cheap food. Their main selling point was free parking. Other strong contenders in Texas included Weingarten&#x27;s and Henke &amp; Pillot.

To end the debate, the Food Marketing Institute in conjunction with the Smithsonian Institution and with funding from H.J. Heinz, researched the issue. They defined the attributes of a supermarket as &quot;self-service, separate product departments, discount pricing, marketing and volume selling&quot;. They determined that the first true supermarket in the United States was opened by a former Kroger employee, Michael J. Cullen, on 4 August 1930, inside a former garage in Jamaica, Queens in New York City. The store King Kullen, operated under the logic of &quot;pile it high and sell it cheap&quot;. The store layout was designed by Joseph Unger, who originated the concept of customers using baskets to collect groceries before checking out at a counter. Everything displayed for sale in the store &quot;had prices clearly marked&quot;, meaning that consumers would no longer need to haggle over prices. Cullen described his store as &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest price wrecker&quot;. At the time of his death in 1936, there were seventeen King Kullen stores in operation. Although Saunders had brought the world self-service, uniform stores, and nationwide marketing, Cullen built on this idea by adding separate food departments, selling large volumes of food at discount prices and adding a parking lot. Moreover, the supermarket format as pioneered by King Kullen was not only cheap, but convenient, in how it combined so many different departments under one roof which had formerly required trips to separate stores. 

Early supermarkets like King Kullen were called &quot;cheapy markets&quot; by industry experts at the time because they were literally so cheap, thanks to their rock-bottom prices; this was soon replaced by the less derogatory and more positive phrase &quot;super market&quot;. The compound phrase was then closed up to become the modern term &quot;supermarket&quot;.

===Grocery stores become supermarkets===
Other established American grocery chains in the 1930s, such as Kroger and Safeway Inc. at first resisted Cullen&#x27;s ideas, but were eventually forced to build their own supermarkets as the economy sank into the Great Depression. American consumers became extraordinarily price-sensitive at a level never experienced before. Kroger took the new retail format one step further and pioneered the first supermarket surrounded on all four sides by a parking lot. 

For A&amp;P, the largest grocery store chain of that era, the conversion from traditional grocery stores to supermarkets came as a terrible shock for the thousands of retail employees whose lives and careers were changed forever. The armies of retail clerks who were the public face of the traditionally slow and social retail experience were replaced with the tedious, specialized jobs necessary to operate a modern supermarket. Stock clerks, usually male, moved boxes and kept the shelves full of goods, while checkout clerks (cashiers), usually female, were faced with never-ending lines of impatient shoppers eager to check out and go. But A&amp;P had no choice but to plunge ahead into this strange new world. One of King Kullen&#x27;s earliest imitators, Big Bear, opened its first supermarket in 1933 in New Jersey and collected more revenue in one year than over a hundred A&amp;P stores. By 1937, 44 percent of A&amp;P stores were losing money. By 1938, A&amp;P had already opened over 1,100 supermarkets. By February 1940, A&amp;P had closed 5,950 grocery stores and cut its percentage of money-losing stores to 18 percent. There was no way to escape the cold, hard numbers driving this brutal process: in A&amp;P&#x27;s traditional grocery stores, &quot;wages and overhead expenses&quot; had consumed 18 percent of sales, while in A&amp;P&#x27;s newly opened supermarkets in those same neighborhoods, those same numbers were less than 12 percent of sales. 

Once the large chains joined the supermarket trend, the new retail format exploded across the country like a wildfire. The number of American supermarkets almost tripled from 1,200 in 32 states in 1936 to over 3,000 in 47 states in 1937. It was well over 15,000 by 1950. One sign of the supermarket format&#x27;s success in slashing labor costs, overhead, and food prices was that the percentage of disposable income spent by American consumers on food plunged &quot;from 21 percent in 1930 to 16 percent in 1940&quot;. The modern era of &quot;cheap food&quot; had begun. 

As large chain stores began to dominate the American grocery landscape with their low overhead and low prices (while crushing numerous independent small stores along the way), a backlash to this radical alteration of food distribution infrastructure appeared in the form of numerous anti-chain campaigns. The idea of &quot;monopsony&quot;, proposed by Cambridge economist Joan Robinson in 1933, that a single buyer could outmaneuver a market of multiple sellers, became a strong anti-chain rhetorical device. With public backlash came political pressure to even the playing field for smaller vendors lacking the luxury of economies of scale. In 1936, the Robinson-Patman Act was implemented as a way of preventing such large chains from using their buying power to reap advantages over small stores, although the act was not well enforced and did not have much impact on such chains.

Supermarkets rapidly proliferated across both Canada and the United States with the growth of automobile ownership and suburban development after World War II. Most North American supermarkets are located in suburban strip shopping centers as an anchor store along with other smaller retailers. They are generally regional rather than national in their company branding. Kroger is the most nationally oriented supermarket chain in the United States, but it has preserved most of its regional brands, including Ralphs, City Market, King Soopers, Fry&#x27;s, Smith&#x27;s, and QFC.

===International expansion===

By the 1950s, supermarkets had become part of the everyday lives of American consumers, but were still extremely rare outside of the United States. Most persons outside the United States had never seen a supermarket or even heard of the term. That began to change after 1956, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture presented an &quot;American Way exhibit&quot; at the International Food Congress in Rome, Italy. The exhibit included &quot;the first fully stocked supermarket outside of the United States&quot;. The exhibit was a rather &quot;modest staging&quot; with only about 2,500 items, not a truly comprehensive duplicate of a typical full-size U.S. supermarket, and yet it was much larger than anything the world had ever seen. Just like the American consumers who had entered the first supermarkets two decades earlier, conference attendees, local Italian visitors, and the international news media were all astonished, bewildered, and stunned by the &quot;mountains of food&quot;.

In 1957, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Association of Food Chains orchestrated an even grander presentation, Supermarket USA, at the Zagreb International Trade Fair in what was then part of Yugoslavia. Supermarket USA featured 4,000 consumer items in a 10,000 square-foot (929 m²) exhibit, &quot;the first fully operational American-style supermarket in a communist country&quot;. The American Way &quot;supermercato&quot; the year before and Supermarket USA were among the first of several instances in which American supermarkets were deployed internationally at the height of the Cold War as shock and awe instruments of American propaganda to demonstrate the supposed superiority of Western Bloc capitalism over Eastern Bloc communism. 

Before then, a few countries had already begun to implement supermarkets due to their proximity to or affinity for the United States. Canada, to the north, had implemented the new retail format at the same time during the 1930s. For example, Québec&#x27;s first supermarket opened in 1934 in Montréal, under the banner Steinberg&#x27;s. In Canada, the largest supermarket chain is Loblaw, which operates stores under a variety of banners targeted to different segments and regions, including Fortinos, Zehrs, No Frills, the Real Canadian Superstore, and Loblaws, the foundation of the company. Sobeys is Canada&#x27;s second largest supermarket with locations across the country, operating under many banners (Sobeys IGA in Quebec). 

In the United Kingdom, self-service shopping took longer to become established, despite its Special Relationship with the United States. In 1947, there were just ten self-service shops in the country. In 1951, ex-US Navy sailor Patrick Galvani, son-in-law of Express Dairies chairman, made a pitch to the board to open a chain of supermarkets across the country. The UK&#x27;s first supermarket under the new Premier Supermarkets brand opened in Streatham, South London, taking in ten times as much revenue per week as the average British general store of the time. Other chains caught on. After Galvani lost out to Tesco&#x27;s Jack Cohen in 1960 to buy 212 stores of the Irwin&#x27;s chain, the sector underwent significant consolidation, resulting in &quot;the big four&quot; dominant UK supermarket chains: Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury&#x27;s and Morrisons.

In the 1950s, supermarkets frequently issued trading stamps as incentives to customers. Today, most chains issue store-specific &quot;membership cards&quot;, &quot;club cards&quot;, or &quot;loyalty cards&quot;. These typically enable the cardholder to receive special members-only discounts on certain items when the credit card-like device is scanned at the checkout. Sales of selected data generated by club cards is becoming a significant revenue stream for some supermarkets.

===In the 21st century===

As of 2018, there were approximately 38,000 supermarkets in the supermarket&#x27;s birthplace, the United States; Americans spent $701 billion at supermarkets that year; and the American supermarket stood at the pinnacle of a food production and distribution system so efficient that less than three percent of the U.S. population produced more than enough food to feed everyone. The average American adult &quot;will spend 2 percent of their life inside&quot; supermarkets. 

In the 21st century, traditional supermarkets in many countries face intense competition from discounters such as Wal-Mart, Aldi and Lidl, which typically is non-union and operates with better buying power. Other competition exists from warehouse clubs such as Costco that offer savings to customers buying in bulk quantities. Superstores, such as those operated by Wal-Mart and Asda, often offer a wide range of goods and services in addition to foods. In Australia, Aldi, Woolworths and Coles are the major players running the industry with fierce competition among all the three. The rising market share of Aldi has forced the other two to cut prices and increase their private label product ranges. The proliferation of such warehouse and superstores has contributed to the continuing disappearance of smaller, local grocery stores, the increased dependence on the automobile, and suburban sprawl because of the necessity for large floor space and increased vehicular traffic. For example, in 2009 51% of Wal-Mart&#x27;s $251 billion domestic sales were recorded from grocery goods. Some critics consider the chains&#x27; common practice of selling loss leaders to be anti-competitive. They are also wary of the negotiating power that large, often multinationals have with suppliers around the world.

===Online-only supermarkets (21st century)===
During the dot-com boom, Webvan, an online-only supermarket, was formed and went bankrupt after three years and was acquired by Amazon. The British online supermarket Ocado, which uses a high degree of automation in its warehouses, was the first successful online-only supermarket. Ocado expanded into providing services to other supermarket firms such as Waitrose and Morrisons.

Grocery stores such as Walmart employ food delivery services offered by third parties such as DoorDash. Other online food delivery services, such as Deliveroo in the United Kingdom, have begun to pay specific attention to supermarket delivery.

Delivery robots are offered by various companies partnering with supermarkets.

Micro-fulfillment centers (MFC) are relatively small warehouses with sophisticated automated rack-and-tote systems which prepare orders for pickup and delivery. Once the order is complete, the customer will pick it up (i.e. &quot;click-and-collect&quot;) or have it fulfilled via home delivery. Supermarkets are investing in micro-fulfillment centers with the hope that automation can help reduce the costs of online commerce and e-commerce by shortening the distances from store to home and speeding up deliveries. MFCs are said by many to be the key to profitably fulfilling online orders.

==Types==
===U.S. categorization===
The U.S. FMI food industry association, drawing on research by Willard Bishop, defines the following formats (store types) that sell groceries:
===Organic and environmentally-friendly supermarkets===
Some supermarkets are focusing on selling more (or even exclusively) organically certified produce. Others are trying to differentiate themselves by selling fewer (or no) products containing palm oil. This as the demand of palm oil is a main driver for the destruction of rainforests. As a response to the growing concern on the heavy use of petroleum-based plastics for food packaging, so-called &quot;zero waste&quot; and &quot;plastic-free&quot; supermarkets and groceries are on the rise.

==Growth in developing countries==

Beginning in the 1990s, the food sector in developing countries has rapidly transformed, particularly in Latin America, South-East Asia, India, China and South Africa. With growth, has come considerable competition and some amount of consolidation. The growth has been driven by increasing affluence and the rise of a middle class; the entry of women into the workforce; with a consequent incentive to seek out easy-to-prepare foods; the growth in the use of refrigerators, making it possible to shop weekly instead of daily; and the growth in car ownership, facilitating journeys to distant stores and purchases of large quantities of goods. The opportunities presented by this potential have encouraged several European companies to invest in these markets (mainly in Asia) and American companies to invest in Latin America and China. Local companies also entered the market. Initial development of supermarkets has now been followed by hypermarket growth. In addition there were investments by companies such as Makro and Metro Cash and Carry in large-scale Cash-and-Carry operations.

While the growth in sales of processed foods in these countries has been much more rapid than the growth in fresh food sales, the imperative nature of supermarkets to achieve economies of scale in purchasing means that the expansion of supermarkets in these countries has important repercussions for small farmers, particularly those growing perishable crops. New supply chains have developed involving cluster formation; development of specialized wholesalers; leading farmers organizing supply, and farmer associations or cooperatives. In some cases supermarkets have organized their own procurement from small farmers; in others wholesale markets have adapted to meet supermarket needs.

==Typical supermarket merchandise==
Larger supermarkets in North America and in Europe typically sell many items among many brands, sizes and varieties. U.S. publisher &quot;Supermarket News&quot; lists the following categories, for example: Hypermarkets have a larger range of non-food categories such as clothing, electronics, household decoration and appliances.
*Bakery (packaged and sometimes a service bakery and/or onsite bakery)
*Beverages (non-alcoholic packaged, sometimes also alcoholic if laws permit)
*Nonfood &amp; Pharmacy (e.g. cigarettes, lottery tickets and over-the-counter medications (as laws permit), DVD rentals, books and magazines, including supermarket tabloids, greeting cards, toys, small selection of home goods like light bulbs, housewares (typically limited)
*Personal care e.g. cosmetics, soap, shampoo 
*Produce (fresh fruits and vegetables)
*Floral (flowers and plants)
*Deli (sliced meats, cheeses, etc.)
*Prepared Foods (packaged and frozen foods)
*Meat (fresh packaged, frozen, sometimes with a butcher service counter)
*Seafood (fresh packaged, frozen, sometimes with a butcher service counter)
*Dairy (milk products and eggs)
*Center store (e.g. detergent, paper products, household cleaning supplies)
*Multicultural (ethnic foods)
*Bulk dried foods
*Animal foods, toys and products

== Layout strategies ==

Most merchandise is already packaged when it arrives at the supermarket. Packages are placed on shelves, arranged in aisles and sections according to type of item. Some items, such as fresh produce, are stored in bins. Those requiring an intact cold chain are in temperature-controlled display cases.

While branding and store advertising will differ from company to company, the layout of a supermarket remains virtually unchanged. Although big companies spend time giving consumers a pleasant shopping experience, the design of a supermarket is directly connected to the in-store marketing that supermarkets must conduct to get shoppers to spend more money while there.

Every aspect of the store is mapped out and attention is paid to color, wording and surface texture. The overall layout of a supermarket is a visual merchandising project that plays a major role. Stores can creatively use a layout to alter customers&#x27; perceptions of the atmosphere. Alternatively, they can enhance the store&#x27;s atmospherics through visual communications (signs and graphics), lighting, colors, and scents. For example, to give a sense of the supermarket being healthy, fresh produce is deliberately located at the front of the store. In terms of bakery items, supermarkets usually dedicate 30 to 40 feet of store space to the bread aisle.

Supermarkets are designed to &quot;give each product section a sense of individual difference and this is evident in the design of what is called the anchor departments; fresh produce, dairy, delicatessen, meat and the bakery&quot;. Each section has different floor coverings, style, lighting and sometimes even individual services counters to allow shoppers to feel as if there are a number of markets within this one supermarket.
Marketers use well-researched techniques to try to control purchasing behavior. The layout of a supermarket is considered by some to consist of a few rules of thumb and three layout principles. The high-draw products are placed in separate areas of the store to keep drawing the consumer through the store. High impulse and high margin products are placed in the most predominant areas to grab attention. Power products are placed on both sides of the aisle to create increased product awareness, and end caps are used to receive a high exposure of a certain product whether on special, promotion or in a campaign, or a new line.

The first principle of the layout is circulation. Circulation is created by arranging product so the supermarket can control the traffic flow of the consumer. Along with this path, there will be high-draw, high-impulse items that will influence the consumer to make purchases which they did not originally intend. Service areas such as restrooms are placed in a location which draws the consumer past certain products to create extra buys. Necessity items such as bread and milk are found at the rear of the store to increase the start of circulation. Cashiers&#x27; desks are placed in a position to promote circulation. In most supermarkets, the entrance will be on the right-hand side because some research suggests that consumers who travel in a counter-clockwise direction spend more. However, other researchers have argued that consumers moving in a clockwise direction can form better mental maps of the store leading to higher sales in turn.

The second principle of the layout is coordination. Coordination is the organized arrangement of product that promotes sales. Products such as fast-selling and slow-selling lines are placed in strategic positions in aid of the overall sales plan. Managers sometimes place different items in fast-selling places to increase turnover or to promote a new line.
The third principle is consumer convenience. The layout of a supermarket is designed to create a high degree of convenience to the consumer to make the shopping experience pleasant and increase customer spending. This is done through the character of merchandising and product placement. There are many different ideas and theories in relation to layout and how product layout can influence the purchases made. One theory suggests that certain products are placed together or near one another that are of a similar or complementary nature to increase the average customer spend. This strategy is used to create cross-category sales similarity. In other words, the toothpaste is next to or adjacent the toothbrushes and the tea and coffee are down the same aisle as the sweet biscuits. These products complement one another and placing them near is one-way marketers try to increase purchases.

For vertical placement, cheap generic brands tend to be on the lowest shelves, products appealing to children are placed at the mid-thigh level, and the most profitable brands are placed at eye level.

The fourth principle is the use of color psychology, and the locations of the food, similar to its use in fast food branding.

Consumer psychologists suggest that most buyers tend to enter the store and shop to their right first. Some supermarkets, therefore, choose to place the entrance to the left-hand side as the consumer will likely turn right upon entry, and this allows the consumer to do a full counter-clockwise circle around the store before returning to the checkouts. This suggests that supermarket marketers should use this theory to their advantage by placing their temporary displays of products on the right-hand side to entice you to make an unplanned purchase. Furthermore, aisle ends are extremely popular with product manufacturers, who pay top dollar to have their products located there. These aisle ends are used to lure customers into making a snap purchase and to also entice them to shop down the aisle. The most obvious place supermarket layout influences consumers are at the checkout. Small displays of candy, magazines, and drinks are located at each checkout to tempt shoppers while they wait to be served.

==Criticisms==
The large scale of supermarkets, while often improving cost and efficiency for customers, can place significant economic pressure on suppliers and smaller shopkeepers. Supermarkets often generate considerable food waste, although modern technologies such as biomethanation units may be able to process the waste into an economical source of energy. Also, purchases tracking may help as supermarkets then become better able to size their stock (of perishable goods), reducing food spoilage.

<text>&quot;Rocket 88&quot; (originally stylized as Rocket &quot;88&quot;) is a song that was first recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, in March 1951. The recording was credited to &quot;Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats&quot;; while Brenston did provide the vocals, the band was actually Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm. The single reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart.

Many music writers acknowledge its importance in the development of rock and roll music, with several considering it to be the first rock and roll record. In 2017, the Mississippi Blues Trail dedicated its 200th marker to &quot;Rocket 88&quot; as an influential record. The song was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1991, the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, and the National Recording Registry in 2024.

==Composition and recording==
The original version of the twelve-bar blues song was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, which reached number one on the R&amp;B charts. Brenston was Ike Turner&#x27;s saxophonist and the Delta Cats were actually Turner&#x27;s Kings of Rhythm back-up band, who rehearsed at the Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Brenston sang the lead vocal and is officially listed as the songwriter. Turner led the band and is credited in some sources as the composer. 

Brenston later said that the song was not particularly original; &quot;they had simply borrowed from another jump blues about an automobile, Jimmy Liggins’ &#x27;Cadillac Boogie. The song was a hymn of praise to the joys of the Oldsmobile Rocket 88 automobile which had recently been introduced, and was based on the 1947 song &quot;Cadillac Boogie&quot; by Jimmy Liggins.

Drawing on the template of jump blues and swing combo music, Turner made the style even rawer, superimposing Brenston&#x27;s enthusiastic vocals, his own piano, distorted guitar played by Willie Kizart (the first use of such a sound on record), and tenor saxophone solos by 17-year-old Raymond Hill. Willie Sims played drums for the recording.

A review of the record in &quot;Time&quot; magazine included:

The legend of how the sound came about says that Kizart&#x27;s amplifier was damaged on Highway 61 when the band was driving from Mississippi to Memphis, Tennessee. An attempt was made to hold the cone in place by stuffing the amplifier with wadded newspapers, which unintentionally created a distorted sound; Phillips liked the sound and used it. Peter Guralnick, in his biography of Sam Phillips, has the amplifier being dropped from the car&#x27;s trunk when the band got a flat tire and was digging out the spare.

Phillips offered this reminiscence about the amp in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;The bass amplifier fell off the car. And when we got in the studio, the woofer had burst; the cone had burst. So I stuck the newspaper and some sack paper in it, and that&#x27;s where we got that sound&quot;. Afterwards, Phillips had no complaints about the unusual effect the &quot;fix&quot; had created. &quot;The more unconventional it sounded, the more interested I would become in it.&quot;

The song was recorded in the Memphis studio of producer Sam Phillips in March 1951, and licensed to Chess Records for release. The record was supposed to be credited to Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm featuring Jackie Brenston, but Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats was printed instead. Turner blamed Phillips for this error since he was the one who licensed it to Chess. Turner and the band were only paid $20 each (US$ in dollars) for the record, with the exception of Brenston who sold the rights to Phillips for $910.

Whether this was the first record of the rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll genre is debated. A 2014 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;Rocket 88&#x27;s reputation may have more to do with Sam Phillips&#x27;s vociferous later claims he had discovered rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;. Time quotes &quot;The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as confirming that &quot;Rocket 88 may well have been the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll record&quot;.

In a later interview, however, Ike Turner offered this comment: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. I think that &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is R&amp;B, but I think &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is the cause of rock and roll existing&quot;.

== Chart performance ==
&quot;Rocket 88&quot; was the third-biggest rhythm and blues single in jukebox plays of 1951, according to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, and ninth in record sales. The single reached the top of the Best Selling R&amp;B Records chart on June 9, 1951, and stayed there for three weeks. It also spent two weeks at the top of the Most Played Juke Box R&amp;B Records chart; spending a total of five weeks at number-one on the R&amp;B charts.

==Influence==

Ike Turner&#x27;s piano intro on &quot;Rocket 88&quot; influenced Little Richard who later used it for his 1958 hit song &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly.&quot;

Sam Philips, the founder of Sun Records and Sun Studio, and many writers have suggested that &quot;Rocket 88&quot; has strong claims to be called the first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll record. Others take a more nuanced view. Charlie Gillett, writing in 1970 in &quot;The Sound of the City&quot;, said that it was &quot;one of several records that people in the music business cite as &#x27;the first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll record. It has been suggested by Larry Birnbaum that the idea that &quot;Rocket 88&quot; could be called &quot;the first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll record&quot; first arose in the late 1960s; he argued that: &quot;One of the reasons is surely that Kizart&#x27;s broken amp anticipated the sound of the fuzzbox, which was in its heyday when &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; was rediscovered.&quot;

Music historian Robert Palmer, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; in 1980, described it as an important and influential record. He noted that Hill&#x27;s saxophone playing was &quot;wilder and rougher&quot; than on many jump blues records, and also emphasized the record&#x27;s &quot;fuzzed-out, overamplified electric guitar&quot;. Writing in his 1984 book &quot;Unsung Heroes of Rock ‘n’ Roll&quot;, Nick Tosches, though rejecting the idea that it could be described as the first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll record &quot;any more than there is any first modern novelthe fact remains that the record in question was possessed of a sound and a fury the sheer, utter newness of which set it apart from what had come before.&quot; Echoing this view, Bill Dahl at AllMusic wrote:

Rock art historian Paul Grushkin wrote: Michael Campbell wrote, in &quot;Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes On&quot;:

Ike Turner himself said, in an interview with Holger Petersen:
The song was covered by several artists over the years, the first being Bill Haley &amp; His Comets in July 1951. No matter which version deserves the accolade, &quot;Rocket 88&quot; is seen as a prototype rock and roll song in musical style and lineup, as well as its lyrical theme, in which an automobile serves as a metaphor for sexual prowess.

==Album appearances==
The song appears on the 1959 compilation album &quot;Oldies in Hi Fi&quot; (Chess LP 1439), on the 1983 Charly Records compilation &quot;Red Hot and Blue&quot; (a tribute to 1950s Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips), and on the 1987 compilation &quot;The Best of Chess Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot; (Chess CH2-6024).

<text>A paper clip (or paperclip) is a tool used to hold sheets of paper together, usually made of steel wire bent to a looped shape (though some are covered in plastic). Most paper clips are variations of the &quot;Gem&quot; type introduced in the 1890s or earlier, characterized by the one and a half loops made by the wire. Common to paper clips proper is their utilization of torsion and elasticity in the wire, and friction between wire and paper. When a moderate number of sheets are inserted between the two &quot;tongues&quot; of the clip, the tongues will be forced apart and cause torsion in the bend of the wire to grip the sheets together. They are usually used to bind papers together for productivity and portability.

The paper clip&#x27;s widespread use in various settings, from offices to educational institutions, underscores its functional design and adaptability. While primarily designed for binding papers, its versatility has led to a range of applications, both practical and creative.

==Shape and composition==
Paper clips usually have an oblong shape with straight sides, but may also be triangular or circular, or have more elaborate shapes. The most common material is steel or some other metal, but molded plastic is also used. Some other kinds of paper clips use a two-piece clamping system. Recent innovations include multi-colored plastic-coated paper clips and spring-fastened binder clips. Regular metal paper clips weigh about a gram.

==History==
According to the Early Office Museum, the first patent for a bent wire paper clip was awarded in the United States to Samuel B. Fay in 1867. This clip was originally intended primarily for attaching tickets to fabric, although the patent recognized that it could be used to attach papers together. Fay received U.S. patent 64,088 on April 23, 1867. Although functional and practical, Fay&#x27;s design along with the 50 other designs patented prior to 1899 are not considered reminiscent of the modern paperclip design known today. Another notable paper clip design was also patented in the United States by Erlman J. Wright on July 24, 1877, patent #193,389. This clip was advertised at that time for use in fastening together loose leaves of papers, documents, periodicals, newspapers etc.

The most common type of wire paper clip still in use, the Gem paper clip, was never patented, but it was most likely in production in Britain in the early 1870s by &quot;The Gem Manufacturing Company&quot;, according to the American expert on technological innovations, Professor Henry J. Petroski. He refers to an 1883 article about &quot;Gem Paper-Fasteners&quot;, praising them for being &quot;better than ordinary pins&quot; for &quot;binding together papers on the same subject, a bundle of letters, or pages of a manuscript&quot;. Since the 1883 article had no illustration of this early &quot;Gem&quot;, it may have been different from modern paper clips of that name.

The earliest illustration of its current form is in an 1893 advertisement for the &quot;Gem Paper Clip&quot;. In 1904 Cushman &amp; Denison registered a trademark for the &quot;Gem&quot; name in connection with paper clips. The announcement stated that it had been used since March 1, 1892, which may have been the time of its introduction in the United States. Paper clips are still sometimes called &quot;Gem clips&quot;, and in Swedish the word for any paper clip is &quot;gem&quot; (but pronounced similar to English &quot;game&quot;).

Definite proof that the modern type of paper clip was well known in 1899 at the latest, is the patent granted to William Middlebrook of Waterbury, Connecticut on April 27 of that year for a &quot;Machine for making wire paper clips.&quot; The drawing clearly shows that the product is a perfect clip of the Gem type. The fact that Middlebrook did not mention it by name, suggests that it was already well known at the time. Since then countless variations on the same theme have been patented. Some have pointed instead of rounded ends, some have the end of one loop bent slightly to make it easier to insert sheets of paper, and some have wires with undulations or barbs to get a better grip. In addition, purely aesthetic variants have been patented, clips with triangular, star, or round shapes. But the original Gem type has for more than a hundred years proved to be the most practical, and consequently by far the most popular. Its qualities—ease of use, gripping without tearing, and storing without tangling—have been difficult to improve upon. In the United States, National Paperclip Day is celebrated on May 29.

The Gem-type paperclip has become a symbol of inventive design, as confirmed below – although falsely – by its celebration as a Norwegian invention in 1899. More convincing is its appropriation as logo of the &quot;Year of Design&quot; () in Barcelona 2003, depicted on posters, T-shirts and other merchandise.

===Unsupported claims===
It has been claimed that the paper clip was invented by English intellectual Herbert Spencer (1820–1903). Spencer registered a &quot;binding-pin&quot; on 2 September 1846, which was made and sold by Adolphus Ackermann for over a year, advertised as &quot;for holding loose manuscripts, sermons, weekly papers, and all unstitched publications&quot;. Spencer&#x27;s design, approximately unfolded, looked more like a modern cotter pin than a modern paper clip.

====Norwegian claim====

Norwegian Johan Vaaler (1866–1910) has been identified as the inventor of the paper clip. He was granted patents in Germany and in the United States (1901) for a paper clip of similar design, but less functional and practical. Because it was more complicated to insert into the paper, Vaaler probably did not know that a better product was already on the market, although not yet in Norway. His version was never manufactured and never marketed because the superior &quot;Gem&quot; was already available.

Long after Vaaler&#x27;s death, his countrymen created a national myth based on the false assumption that the paper clip was invented by an unrecognized Norwegian genius. Norwegian dictionaries since the 1950s have mentioned Vaaler as the inventor of the paper clip, and that myth later found its way into international dictionaries and much of the international literature on paper clips.

Vaaler probably succeeded in having his design patented abroad, despite the previous existence of more useful paper clips, because patent authorities at that time were quite liberal and rewarded any marginal modification of existing inventions. Johan Vaaler began working for &quot;Alfred J. Bryns Patentkontor&quot; in Kristiania in 1892 and was later promoted to office manager, a position he held until his death. As the employee of a patent office, he could easily have obtained a patent in Norway. His reasons for applying abroad are not known; it is possible that he wanted to secure the commercial rights internationally. Also, he may have been aware that a Norwegian manufacturer would find it difficult to introduce a new invention abroad, starting from the small home market.

Vaaler&#x27;s patents expired quietly, while the &quot;Gem&quot; was used worldwide, including his own country. The failure of his design was its impracticality. Without the two full loops of the fully developed paper clip, it was difficult to insert sheets of paper into his clip. One could manipulate the end of the inner wire so that it could receive the sheet, but the outer wire was a dead end because it could not exploit the torsion principle. The clip would instead stand out like a keel, perpendicular to the sheet of paper. The impracticality of Vaaler&#x27;s design may easily be demonstrated by cutting off the last outer loop and one long side from a regular Gem clip.

====National symbol====
The originator of the Norwegian paper clip myth was an engineer of the Norwegian national patent agency who visited Germany in the 1920s to register Norwegian patents in that country. He came across Vaaler&#x27;s patent but failed to detect that it was not the same as the then-common Gem-type clip. In the report of the first fifty years of the patent agency, he wrote an article in which he proclaimed Vaaler to be the inventor of the common paper clip. This piece of information found its way into some Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II.

Events of that war contributed greatly to the mythical status of the paper clip. Patriots wore them in their lapels as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi authorities when other signs of resistance, such as flag pins or pins showing the cipher of the exiled King Haakon VII of Norway, were forbidden. Those wearing them did not yet see them as national symbols, as the myth of their Norwegian origin was not commonly known at the time.
The clips were meant to denote solidarity and unity (&quot;we are bound together&quot;). The wearing of paper clips was soon prohibited, and people wearing them could risk severe punishment.

The leading Norwegian encyclopedia mentioned the role of the paper clip as a symbol of resistance in a supplementary volume in 1952 but did not yet proclaim it a Norwegian invention. That information was added in later editions. According to the 1974 edition, the idea of using the paper clip to denote resistance originated in France. A clip worn on a lapel or front pocket could be seen as &quot;deux gaules&quot; (two posts or poles) and be interpreted as a reference to the leader of the French Resistance, General Charles de Gaulle.

The post-war years saw a widespread consolidation of the paper clip as a national symbol. Authors of books and articles on the history of Norwegian technology eagerly seized it to make a thin story more substantial. They chose to overlook the fact that Vaaler&#x27;s clip was not the same as the fully developed Gem-type clip. In 1989, a giant paper clip, almost high, was erected on the campus of a commercial college near Oslo in honor of Vaaler, ninety years after his invention was patented. But this monument shows a Gem-type clip, not the one patented by Vaaler. The celebration of the alleged Norwegian origin of the paper clip culminated in 1999, one hundred years after Vaaler submitted his application for a German patent. A commemorative stamp was issued that year, the first in a series to draw attention to Norwegian inventiveness. The background shows a facsimile of the German &quot;Patentschrift&quot;. However, the figure in the foreground is not the paper clip depicted on that document, but the much better known &quot;Gem&quot;. In 2005, the national biographical encyclopedia of Norway (&quot;Norsk biografisk leksikon&quot;) published the biography of Johan Vaaler, stating he was the inventor of the paper clip.

==Other uses==
Wire is versatile in its nature. Thus a paper clip is a useful accessory in many kinds of mechanical work, including computer work: the metal wire can be unfolded with a little force. Several devices call for a very thin rod to push a recessed button which the user might only rarely need. This is seen on most CD-ROM drives as an &quot;emergency eject&quot; should the power fail; also on early floppy disk drives (including the early Macintosh). Various smartphones require the use of a long, thin object such as a paper clip to eject the SIM card and some Palm PDAs advise the use of a paper clip to reset the device. The trackball can be removed from early Logitech pointing devices using a paper clip as the key to the bezel. A paper clip bent into a &quot;U&quot; can be used to start an ATX PSU without connecting it to a motherboard, by connecting the green[what?] to a black[what?] on the motherboard header. One or more paper clips can make a loopback device for a RS-232 interface (or indeed many interfaces). A paper clip could be installed in a Commodore 1541 disk drive as a flexible head-stop. The steel wire from a paperclip can be used in dentistry to form a dental post.

Pipe smokers, including Cannabis smokers use straightened out paper clips to unclog their pipe or bong bowl.

Another creative use of paper clips is in &quot;paperclip art&quot;, where enthusiasts bend and twist paper clips into intricate designs and figures, ranging from simple shapes to detailed sculptures. This form of art showcases the flexibility and adaptability of the paper clip beyond its traditional use.

Additionally, paper clips can serve as temporary bookmarks in books or documents. Their slim profile and easy placement make them useful for marking a specific page or section without causing damage or adding bulk.

Paper clips can be bent into a crude but sometimes effective lock picking device. Some types of handcuffs can be unfastened using paper clips. There are two approaches. The first one is to unfold the clip in a line and then twist the end in a right angle, trying to imitate a key and using it to lift the lock fixator. The second approach, which is more feasible but needs some practice, is to use the semi-unfolded clip kink for lifting when the clip is inserted through the hole where the handcuffs are closed.

A paper clip image is the standard image for an attachment in an email client.

==Trade==

In 1994, the United States imposed anti-dumping tariffs against China on paper clips.

<doc id="51874" wikidata="Q3174333" url="?curid=51874" title="Googly">
<text>A googly, also known as a wrong&#x27;un or Bosie, is a type of delivery in the game of cricket bowled by a right-arm leg spin bowler. It is different from the normal delivery for a leg-spin bowler in that it is turning the other way. The googly is &quot;not&quot; a variation of the typical off spin type of delivery, in that the cricket ball is presented from the bowler&#x27;s hand in such a way that once the ball pitches; instead, it deviates in the opposite direction of a leg spinning type of delivery (i.e. towards the leg stump rather than the off stump). It has also been colloquially referred to as the wrong&#x27;un, Bosie or Bosey, with the latter two eponyms referring to Bernard Bosanquet, the bowler who originally devised and began using the googly. He first employed it in July 1900, during the second innings of a County Championship match between Middlesex and Leicestershire at Lord&#x27;s. In that game, Sam Coe became the first batter known to have been dismissed by a googly. During the Edwardian era, some considered its use to be an example of cheating.

== Explanation ==

While a normal leg break spins from the leg to the off side, away from a right-handed batter, a googly spins the other side, from off to leg, into a right-handed batter (and is distinct from an off break delivery). The bowler achieves this change of spin by bending the wrist sharply from the normal leg break delivery position. When the ball rolls out of the hand (from the side near the little finger, as in a normal leg break), it emerges with a clockwise spin (from the bowler&#x27;s point of view). A googly may also be achieved by bowling the ball as a conventional leg break, but spinning the ball further with the fingers just before it is released.

The change of wrist action can be seen by a skilled batter and the change of spin allowed for when playing a shot at the ball. Less skilled batters, or ones who have lost their concentration, can be deceived completely, expecting the ball to move one direction off the pitch, only for it to move the other direction. If the batter is expecting a leg break, he or she will play outside the line of the ball after it spins. This means the ball can strike the pads for a potential leg before wicket (lbw) appeal, fly between the bat and the pads and hit the wicket, or catch the edge of the bat.

The googly is a major weapon in the arsenal of a leg spin bowler, and can be one of the bowler&#x27;s most effective most important wicket-taking balls. It is used infrequently, because its effectiveness comes mostly from its surprise value.

Left-arm unorthodox spinners can bowl with the googly action using the left arm. This delivery turns away from a right-handed batter, like a leg break or left-arm orthodox spinner. This type of delivery was known historically as a &quot;chinaman&quot;.

The googly is similar in principle to the doosra, the ball from an off-spinner that turns the opposite way from his stock ball.

&quot;Chambers Dictionary&quot; describes the whole etymology of the word as &quot;dubious&quot;.

== Mechanics ==
To grip the ball for a leg-spinning delivery, the ball is placed into the palm with the seam parallel to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball, and the third and fourth fingers close together and rest against the side of the ball. The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting against the side is up to the bowler, but should impart no pressure. When the ball is bowled, the third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released, adding more spin. The ball is tossed up to provide flight. The batter will see the back of the hand when the ball is released.

An alternative grip is to hold the ball in the thumb, index finger and middle finger. The finger-print of both the thumb and index finger rest on the seam, as does the first bend of the middle finger. Together with rotation of the wrist, the index and middle fingers are involved in imparting spin on the ball and can achieve a very high number of revolutions.

As with the more conventional grip, all the various deliveries can be bowled with the same level of success and the wrist and fingers must also be relaxed.
== In popular culture ==
In a scene from John Boorman&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Hope and Glory&quot;, David Hayman plays a father who, before leaving to fight in WWII, passes on &quot;the secret of the googly&quot; to his young son.

<text>The Pim Fortuyn List (, LPF) was a right-wing populist political party in the Netherlands named after its eponymous founder Pim Fortuyn, a former university professor and political columnist. The party was considered nationalist as well as adhering to its own distinct ideology of &quot;Fortuynism&quot; according to some commentators.

The LPF supported tougher measures against immigration and crime, opposition to multiculturalism, greater political reform, a reduction in state bureaucracy and was eurosceptic but differed somewhat from other European right-wing or nationalist parties by taking a liberal stance on certain social issues and sought to describe its ideology as pragmatic and not populistic. It also aimed to present itself as an alternative to the Polder model of Dutch politics and the governing style of the existing mainstream parties.
Pim Fortuyn had initially had planned to contest the 2002 general election as leader of the Livable Netherlands (LN) party. He was however dismissed as leader of LN in February 2002 due to controversial remarks he made in a newspaper interview on immigration-related issues, and instead founded LPF a few days later, taking many former LN candidates with him. After gaining support in opinion polls, Fortuyn was assassinated on 6 May 2002, nine days before the election. The party held onto its support, and went on to become the second-largest party in the election.

The LPF formed part of a coalition government with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) as part of the first Balkenende cabinet and was granted ministerial posts. However, internal conflicts in the LPF led to the coalition&#x27;s break-up and fresh elections after a few months. Following the 2003 election, the party was left in opposition. It became clear that the party was not viable without its original leader, and it went into decline until it was finally dissolved in 2008. Both Fortuyn and the LPF have had a significant influence on changing Dutch public discourse on immigration, multiculturalism, and political reform, and went on to influence politicians in both the mainstream and newer political parties.

==History==
===Background===
The LPF was founded by its namesake, Pim Fortuyn, a former sociology professor who had become known in the Netherlands as an author, press columnist and a media commentator. Fortuyn announced his intention to run for parliament in a television interview on 20 August 2001. An unusual aspect of this was that it was not yet clear which political party he would be a candidate for. Although he was already in contact with the Livable Netherlands (LN) party, he initially also considered running for the Christian Democratic Appeal (for whom he had briefly worked as an advisor) or creating his own list. He subsequently became a member of the LN in 2001 at the encouragement of its chairman Jan Nagel. On 25 November he was chosen as party leader for the LN. The LN functioned as the combined national extension of various movements that existed as localist alternatives to the main parties and had contested municipal elections but had never contested in national elections before. Fortuyn concluded his acceptance speech by saying the words that would become his slogan; &quot;At your service!&quot; Almost immediately after Fortuyn became leader, LN went from 2% in opinion polls to about 17%.

In January 2002, it was announced that Fortuyn also would head the Livable Rotterdam (LR) list for the March 2002 local elections. The official 2002 election study found that immigration and integration problems were the second most important issue for voters after issues concerning the health care system. Helped by the many speeches and interviews given by Fortuyn, immigration issues became the major topic of the national political agenda, thereby forcing other parties to react.

Until February, Liveable Netherlands had received disproportionate and generally sympathetic coverage in the media. The situation took a dramatic turn on 9 February, when Fortuyn was interviewed in &quot;de Volkskrant&quot;, one of the leading national newspapers. Against the strong advice of his campaign team, he made several controversial statements; including one that said Islam was &quot;a backward culture&quot;, that no more asylum seekers would be allowed into the country, and, if necessary, the possible repeal of anti-racism clauses in the Dutch Constitution to protect freedom of speech. Fortuyn was dismissed as party leader the next day, and in a television interview said that the split was irreparable, although he would have preferred to remain in the party.

===Establishment===
Fortuyn founded Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) on 11 February taking several former LN supporters and members with him. He began assembling candidates to stand in the upcoming general election, secured financial backing from several individuals involved in the property development sector and was allocated an office and campaign headquarters in downtown Rotterdam. Within a short time, Fortuyn was able to secure thirty candidates for the election. Mat Herben was appointed as LPF group leader. Second on the party&#x27;s list was João Varela, originally from Cape Verde whom Fortuyn proposed as immigration minister should he become prime minister. Fortuyn also recruited Jim Janssen van Raaij a former member of the European Parliament for the CDA and one of few on the list with professional political experience. Others included former editor of &quot;Elsevier&quot; Ferry Hoogendijk, ex-drafts champion Harm Wiersma, civil servant Joost Eerdmans, Surinamese broadcaster Philomena Bijlhout, counter-terrorism officer André Peperkoorn, spokesman for farmers Wien van den Brink and spokeswoman for the Central Bureau of Food Trade Winny de Jong. The party&#x27;s candidates were unveiled by Fortuyn at a press conference in March 2002.

Opinion polls soon showed that he took most of LN&#x27;s supporters with him, leaving LN with its original 2%, while Fortuyn soared to 17%. The local LR—which held on to Fortuyn as its leader—was hugely successful in the March 2002 local elections, as it won more than one third of the vote and became Rotterdam&#x27;s strongest party, displacing the Labour Party who had governed Rotterdam since World War Two.

In the run-up to the 2002 general election, Fortuyn appeared in numerous television and radio interviews to generate publicity, and was featured in the televised leadership debates representing his new party. He was often attacked or derided as an extremist figure by other party leaders (in particular Labour leader Ad Melkert, former prime minister Wim Kok and GroenLinks&#x27;s Paul Rosenmöller), and both Dutch and foreign media outlets compared Fortuyn to other European far-right party leaders. Fortuyn disputed the comparisons and stated that the press and other party leaders were distorting or mislabeling him and his ideas. However, polling showed rapid and growing support for the LPF, with some polls indicating that the LPF would emerge as the largest party and make Fortuyn a candidate for prime minister. Fortuyn himself maintained that he would not accept a cabinet position headed by another party leader and aimed to take the role of prime minister himself.

===Fortuyn assassination===

It was reported in February 2002 that Fortuyn did not dare to appear in public owing to death threats. In March, he was attacked by pie-throwing activists at the presentation of his new book &quot;De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars&quot; (which became the bestselling book by a Dutch author in the Netherlands in 2002). Despite this, the authorities did not provide protection for Fortuyn, nor did he request protection. In various interviews, including with the BBC and &quot;Jensen!,&quot; Fortuyn expressed a concern that he would be killed or injured during the election campaign, and argued that if such an event were to happen, the media and Dutch political establishment would be to blame through creating a hostile atmosphere against him.

On 6 May, Fortuyn was assassinated outside a radio studio in Hilversum. This was the first political murder in the Netherlands for centuries (excluding the Second World War). Some claimed that by demonising Fortuyn, the political left and the media had created a climate of opinion that had made the assassination possible. Campaigning immediately stopped, and although some suggested postponing the elections, the campaign resumed (half-heartedly) after his funeral four days later. His funeral was broadcast live on television and, according to Cas Mudde, lead &quot;to scenes of mass hysteria not seen since the Netherlands national football team won the European Championship in 1988.&quot; The murder of Fortuyn, together with that of Theo van Gogh two years later, would result in a polarisation in the political debate in the Netherlands, and subsequently changes in immigration-related policies and public discourse.

===First Balkenende cabinet (2002–2003)===
The LPF decided to maintain Fortuyn&#x27;s posthumous candidacy, and delayed naming a new leader until after the election. The 2002 general election proved a great success for the LPF, yielding 17% of the votes and 26 seats in the House of Representatives—by far a record number of seats in the Netherlands for a new party—to become the second largest party. LN also made it into Parliament, with two seats. The Labour Party (PvdA) and People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) saw their largest-ever losses, while the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) won large gains – later attributed in part to the fact that CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende had remained neutral and not joined in attacking Fortuyn with other party leaders during debates. Balkenende had earlier announced that his party would follow a tougher line towards asylum seekers and tighten some of the Netherlands&#x27;s immigration policies, and he later agreed with much of Fortuyn&#x27;s criticism of the purple coalition and Holland&#x27;s multicultural society. Some commentators claimed that the CDA was able to draw in voters who otherwise would have supported the LPF (but felt it was no longer viable without Fortuyn in charge) or that the CDA was seen as a stabilizing force after a tense election. As leader of the strongest party, Balkenende became the leading candidate for prime minister.

Following the election, journalist and former civil servant Mat Herben was chosen as LPF party leader as Fortuyn&#x27;s successor. Together with the CDA and the VVD, the party formed part of the governing coalition, and supplied several members for the Balkenende cabinet. The party was granted four of fourteen cabinet seats, for immigration, economics, environment, health and sports, and five state secretaries. LPF member Eduard Bomhoff was appointed deputy prime minister. The following day after the cabinet&#x27;s formation, LPF State Secretary for Social Affairs and Work Opportunity Philomena Bijlhout resigned after it was reported that she had been a member of a Surinamese militia. She was replaced by fellow LPF MP Khee Liang Phoa.

Without its original leader and lack of a clearly defined organisational structure and political experience among its members, the LPF also succumbed to highly public internal squabbles. MPs within the LPF resigned to sit as independents due to the infighting and the intense media storm following Fortuyn&#x27;s death or unsuccessfully tried founding splinter parties of their own to contest in the next election. In August 2002, Herben resigned as leader and was briefly replaced by Harry Wijnschenk. Wijnschenk was subsequently ousted from his position and replaced by Herben again, but by October 2002, the break-up of the government coalition was ultimately triggered by the bickering of LPF Ministers Eduard Bomhoff and Herman Heinsbroek.

===Opposition and disintegration (2003–2006)===
In the January 2003 general election, the LPF shrank to 5.7% support and gained eight seats while Balkenende and the CDA retained a majority. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 in the government coalition. The LPF found it hard to maintain support in parliamentary opposition as besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible or considered as charismatic as Fortuyn, while party leader Herben had enough work keeping the party from further infighting. The LPF also went into financial straits as many of its former financial backers left. Other commentators later claimed that the relative inexperience of some of the LPF&#x27;s members and lack of internal structure hampered its ability to function as a coherent movement. As the new coalition continued most of the former coalition&#x27;s policies and Balkenende stated that he agreed with some of Fortuyn&#x27;s views on multiculturalism and implemented some of his policy ideas, it became increasingly difficult for the LPF to present the anti-establishment or alternative image to the government which had galvanized support for the party in the first place.

The LPF did see some success in the 2003 Dutch provincial elections in which it won 17 seats in eleven provinces, enabling it to qualify for a seat in the Senate which was taken by Rob Hessing. However, the party was beset by further internal problems and won just 2.6% of the vote in the 2004 European Parliament election, and did not win a seat. In this election, Paul van Buitenen surprisingly won two seats with his anti-corruption Europe Transparent (although it was not successful in the long term). By 2004, the LPF had fallen to a less than 1% support and disintegrated. The party had lost most of its members, and the parliamentary faction (with exception of Wien van den Brink) had declared itself independent from the party. In 2005, LPF minister and parliamentarian Hilbrand Nawijn held a meeting with Vlaams Belang politician Filip Dewinter in the former home of Fortuyn which caused uproar within the party since Fortuyn had stated he had wanted nothing to do with Dewinter&#x27;s former Vlaams Blok party. Nawijn subsequently left the LPF and announced the formation of a new party with ideas closer to Vlaams Belang.

===List Five Fortuyn and dissolution (2006–2008)===
The LPF attempted to start afresh and participated in the 2006 general election under its new name List Five Fortuyn (&quot;Lijst Vijf Fortuyn&quot;). On 25 September 2006, the party released a controversial campaign commercial which featured new leader Olaf Stuger coming down from &quot;heaven&quot; with a parachute and presenting himself as a &quot;reincarnation&quot; of Pim Fortuyn. Marten Fortuyn, brother of Pim Fortuyn, declared it &quot;outrageous and tasteless.&quot; In the election, LVF did not receive enough votes to secure a seat with support of only 0.2%. It also lost all of its seats in the 2007 Provincial Council elections, meaning it was no longer eligible for representation in the Senate. By this stage, many former LPF supporters were switching to the new Party for Freedom led by Geert Wilders which contained similar policies to the LPF and emerged as a successor. In 2006, the party closed its office in the Hague and in July 2007 voted to dissolve itself by 1 January 2008.

==Ideology==
The party was variously described as populist, nationalist, conservative-liberal, national-liberal, national-conservative, classical-liberal, eurosceptic and anti-Islam. Some scholars and political scientists observed that the LPF presented a distinct ideology that differed from other populist parties in Europe while Fortuyn himself maintained that both he and the party based their beliefs on pragmatic, not populistic ideas and wanted the LPF to represent an alternative set of policy solutions to what Fortuyn regarded as an identical consensus within the existing Dutch political establishment.

===Fortuynism===
The ideology or political style that is derived from Pim Fortuyn, and in turn the LPF, is often called &quot;Fortuynism&quot;. Observers variously saw him as a political protest targeting the alleged elitism and bureaucratic style of the Dutch purple coalitions or as offering an appealing political style. The style was characterized variously as one &quot;of openness, directness and clearness&quot;, populism or simply as charisma. Another school holds Fortuynism as a distinct ideology, with an alternative vision of society. Some argued that Fortuynism was not just &quot;one&quot; ideology, but contained liberalism, populism and nationalism. Gerrit Boerman, the head of the Document Center for Dutch Political Parties at the University of Groningen described Fortuyn&#x27;s and by extension the LPF&#x27;s ideology as not fitting into the traditional left-right pattern and described it as a &quot;cocktail of elements stemming from different directions&quot; which included strands of conservatism, communitarianism, libertarianism, classical and social liberalism, and national-populism. 

During the 2002 campaign, Fortuyn was accused of being on the &quot;extreme right&quot;, although others saw only certain similarities. Comparisons were drawn between Fortuyn and the LPF with far-right populist leaders and parties in Europe such as Jean-Marie Le Pen and his French National Front by foreign journalists and these were often referred to by the Dutch media and rival politicians. However, this was strongly disputed by Fortuyn who stated he wanted nothing to do with such leaders while the LPF called the comparisons &quot;over-simplified&quot; and inaccurate, asserting that the party&#x27;s immigration programme was not based on hatred of foreigners. While Fortuyn employed anti-immigration rhetoric, he was neither a radical nationalist nor a defender of traditional authoritarian values. On the contrary, Fortuyn wanted to protect the socio-culturally liberal values of the Netherlands, women&#x27;s rights and sexual minorities (he was openly homosexual himself), from the &quot;backward&quot; Islamic culture. Fortuyn often maintained that his opposition to immigration was not motivated by the race or skin colour of immigrants. The LPF also won support from some ethnic minorities and fielded candidates from immigrant backgrounds during the 2002 election; one of Fortuyn&#x27;s closest associates was of Cape Verdean origin while one of the party&#x27;s MPs was a young woman of Turkish descent.

====Domestic policy====
Many of the LPF&#x27;s policies for the 2002 general election were based on proposals put forward in Fortuyn&#x27;s book &quot;De puinhopen van acht jaar Paars&quot;. The LPF campaigned on a strong law and order message at both local and national levels. The party supported cutting state bureaucracy while strengthening public services. The party also called for reforms to the Netherland&#x27;s employment policy, proposed reducing the number of civil servants and abolishing permanent contracts for government employees. It also wanted to revise and strongly restrict immigration and asylum policies, particularly from Islamic societies, as well as put an end to the Dutch government&#x27;s policy of pursuing multiculturalism. Instead, the party argued for compulsory policies that existing immigrants learn Dutch and become integrated while future immigration would be reduced or halted until existing immigrants had been assimilated. However, Fortuyn also maintained that asylum seekers or illegal immigrants who had been living in the Netherlands for a long period should not be deported and instead be pardoned and offered a path to citizenship if they demonstrated the ability to assimilate into Dutch society and had not committed crimes while potential migrants would be offered financial incentives to stay in their own country. During the 2002 election and cabinet formation, the LPF proposed that asylum seekers who already had been in the Netherlands for more than five years could be pardoned while the government should temporarily stop all future immigration and asylum intake. In the First Balkenende cabinet, LPF immigration minister Hilbrand Nawijn proposed the &quot;One-off Regulation 2003&quot; which would give a grace period for long-term asylum seekers to gain residency while asylum migration would be frozen for a period, however the cabinet collapsed before this could be effectuated. The party also supported the right to freedom of speech and took a socially liberal stance on issues such as gay rights, soft drug legalization and gender equality.

The LPF also supported reforming the Dutch economic model, arguing that outdated bureaucracy and welfare systems had created psychological and physical barriers to entrepreneurship and modernization of the economy. Fortuyn supported locating workplaces, smaller schools and regional hospitals closer to communities, expanding internet infrastructure outside of cities and replacing parts of the state with digital technology. Some political historians describe the LPF as supporting &quot;market populist&quot; ideas and holding both a free market vision while stressing communitarian ideas and being one of the first European populist parties associated with a rise in anti-globalization arguments.

====Foreign policy====
Although the LPF was established post-9/11, Fortuyn had already developed a worldview based on the &quot;clash between civilizations&quot;, namely between &quot;modernity&quot; and Islam, or Western society and Islamic culture. The LPF supported NATO, but was eurosceptic and saw the European Union as a &quot;bureaucracy which barely interests its citizens, let alone inspires them.&quot; The party was against the euro currency (which the Netherlands had adopted in 1999), EU influence over Dutch domestic regulation, and opposed the Netherlands participating in the European Schengen agreement. Fortuyn also campaigned to reduce Dutch financial contributions to the European Union and criticised the EU for being &quot;elite&quot; and &quot;technocratic&quot;. The party however did not oppose the principle of economic and political cooperation between European countries and the project of European integration in general, but rather the EU&#x27;s present organization, and what it regarded as its lack of democracy, excessive bureaucracy and threat to national sovereignty. The LPF also warned that unopposed EU expansion would lead to the Netherlands becoming absorbed into a Federal Superstate in which Dutch identity would be lost. Opposing the full membership of Turkey, Albania, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, the LPF maintained that the European Union &quot;shouldn&#x27;t cross the Bosporus and the Ural&quot;. The LPF was also supportive of Israel.

==Legacy==
Fortuyn&#x27;s political heritage became scattered among various politicians in the Netherlands, several of whom had begun their careers in the LPF and tried founding parties of their own, most of which were unsuccessful. These included Marco Pastors and Joost Eerdmans, founders of the One NL, Winny de Jong of DeConservatieven.nl, and Hilbrand Nawijn, leader of the Party for the Netherlands—none of which managed to win a seat in the 2003 or 2006 elections. Other parties included Forza! Nederland founded by Paul Meijer and Fleur Agema, both former members of the LPF branch on the States-Provincial of North Holland. The LPF also influenced politicians in the Flemish region of Belgium, such as lawyer and Open VLD member Hugo Coveliers who went on to found the VLOTT party based on Fortuyn&#x27;s ideas, and Jean-Marie Dedecker and his Lijst Dedecker party. However, in the Netherlands the LPF became squeezed out by the tougher line on immigration and integration issues taken by mainstream politicians, such as Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk, who had largely adopted Fortuyn&#x27;s policies. By the end of the decade, former LPF supporters had mostly moved to support Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV). Traces of Fortuyn&#x27;s legacy have remained at a national political level with former LPF politician Fleur Agema being elected to parliament for the Party for Freedom and later becoming Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands in 2024. 

In February 2006, soon before it fell out of parliament, the scholar Hans Jansen organised a conference in cooperation with the scientific committee of the LPF in the House of Representatives building that brought together several international anti-Islam figures, including Bat Ye&#x27;or, Daniel Pipes, Geert Wilders, Robert Spencer, Bruce Bawer, Lars Hedegaard, Ibn Warraq, Paul Beliën and Peder &quot;Fjordman&quot; Jensen. This movement would eventually become known as the counter-jihad movement.

In 2020, Eerdemans founded the JA21 party which claims to want to help &quot;Fortuyn&#x27;s ideas return to the House of Representatives&quot;.

Although dissolved at national level, the name &quot;Pim Fortuyn List&quot; continued to be used for a period at municipal level by local branches that split off from the LPF in Eindhoven, Boornsterhem, Westland and The Hague. As of 2018, the last remaining local party using &quot;Pim Fortuyn List&quot; were in Eindhoven and Westland which competed in the municipal elections under the names &quot;LPF Eindhoven&quot; and &quot;LPF Westland.&quot; In 2022 a new local Pim Fortuyn List entered the municipal elections in the city of Breda winning one seat in the council. The LPF&#x27;s youth-wing the &quot;Jonge Fortuynisten&quot; continues to remain active as an independent organisation and is affiliated to LPF Eindhoven.

<text>Bowling, in cricket, is the action of propelling the ball toward the wicket defended by a batter. A player skilled at bowling is called a &quot;bowler&quot;; a bowler who is also a competent batter is known as an all-rounder. Bowling the ball is distinguished from &quot;throwing&quot; the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition, which restricts the angle of extension of the elbow. A single act of bowling the ball towards the batter is called a &quot;ball&quot; or a &quot;delivery&quot;. Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an &quot;over&quot;. Once a bowler has bowled an over, a teammate will bowl an over from the other end of the pitch. The Laws of Cricket govern how a ball must be bowled. If a ball is bowled illegally, an umpire will rule it a &quot;no-ball&quot;. If a ball is bowled too wide of the striker for the batter to be able to play at it with a proper cricket shot, the bowler&#x27;s end umpire will rule it a &quot;wide&quot;.

There are different types of bowlers, from fast bowlers, whose primary weapon is pace, through swing and seam bowlers who try to make the ball deviate in its course through the air or when it bounces, to slow bowlers, who will attempt to deceive the batter with a variety of flight and spin. A spin bowler usually delivers the ball quite slowly and puts spin on the ball, causing it to turn at an angle while bouncing off the pitch.

A team can be said to have elected to &quot;have a bowl&quot; when it wins the coin toss and chooses to field.

==History==
 
In the early days of cricket, underarm bowling was the only method employed.
Many theories exist about the origins of cricket. One suggests that the game began among shepherds hitting a stone or a ball of wool with their crooks and, at the same time, defending the wicket gate into the sheep-fold (from Anglo Saxon &#x27;cricce&#x27;, a crooked staff). A second theory suggests the name came from a low stool known as a &#x27;cricket&#x27; in England, which from the side looked like the long, low wicket used in the early days of the game (originally from the Flemish &#x27;krickstoel&#x27;, a low stool on which parishioners knelt in church). There is also a reference to &#x27;criquet&#x27; in North-East France in 1478 and evidence that the game evolved in South-East England in the Middle Ages.

In 1706 William Goldwyn published the first description of the game. He wrote that two teams were first seen carrying their curving bats to the venue, choosing a pitch and arguing over the rules to be played. They pitched two sets of wickets, each with a &quot;milk-white&quot; bail perched on two stumps; tossed a coin for first knock, the umpire called &quot;play&quot; and the &quot;leathern orb&quot; was bowled. They had four-ball overs, the umpires leant on their staves (which the batters had to touch to complete a run), and the scorers sat on a mound making notches.

The first written &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; were drawn up in 1744. They stated, &quot;the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes. The stumps must be 22 inches high and the bail across them six inches. The ball must be between 5 &amp; 6 ounces, and the two sets of stumps 22 yards apart&quot;. There were no limits on the shape or size of the bat. It appears that 40 notches was viewed as a very big score, probably due to the bowlers bowling quickly at shins unprotected by pads. The world&#x27;s first cricket club was formed in Hambledon in the 1760s and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in 1787.

During the 1760s and 1770s it became common to pitch the ball through the air, rather than roll it along the ground. This innovation gave bowlers the weapons of length, deception through the air, plus increased pace. It also opened new possibilities for spin and swerve. In response, batters had to master timing and shot selection. One immediate consequence was the replacement of the curving bat with the straight one. All of this raised the premium on skill and lessened the influence of rough ground and brute force. It was in the 1770s that the modern game began to take shape. The weight of the ball was limited to between five and a half and five and three-quarter ounces, and the width of the bat to four inches. The latter ruling followed an innings by a batter called Thomas &quot;Daddy&quot; White, who appeared with a bat the width of the wicket. In 1774, the first leg before law was published. Also around this time, a third stump became commonplace. By 1780, the duration of a first-class cricket match was generally three days, and this year also saw the creation of the first six-seam cricket ball. In 1788, the MCC published its first revision of the laws, which prohibited charging down an opponent and also provided for mowing and covering the wicket to standardise conditions. The desire for standardisation reflected the massive increase in the popularity of cricket during the 18th century. Between 1730 and 1740, 150 cricket matches were recorded in the papers of the time. Between 1750 and 1760, this figure rose to 230, and between 1770 and 1790 over 500.

The 19th century saw a series of significant changes. Wide deliveries were outlawed in 1811. The circumference of the ball was specified for the first time in 1838 (its weight had been dictated 60 years earlier). Pads, made of cork, became available for the first time in 1841, and these were further developed following the invention of vulcanised rubber, which was also used to introduce protective gloves in 1848. In the 1870s, boundaries were introduced – previously, all hits had to be run; if the ball went into the crowd, the spectators would clear a way for the fieldsman to fetch it. The biggest change, however, was in how the ball was delivered by the bowler.

At the start of the century, all bowlers were still delivering the ball under-arm. However, so the story goes, John Willes became the first bowler to use a &quot;round-arm&quot; technique after practising with his sister Christina, who had used the technique, as she was unable to bowl underarm due to her wide dress impeding her delivery of the ball.

The round-arm action came to be employed widely in matches but was quickly determined to be illegal and banned by the MCC, who stated that &quot;the ball must be delivered underhand, not thrown or jerked, with the hand underneath the elbow at the time of delivering the ball&quot;. When it was accepted the rules stated that the arm could not be raised above the shoulder. It was quickly found, however, that a raised arm imparted more accuracy and generated more bounce than the roundarm method. Again, the governing body banned the method. It was not until the method was finally accepted by the MCC in 1835 that it grew rapidly in popularity amongst all players. Underarm bowling hitherto had almost disappeared from the game.

===Modern-day underarm bowling===
An infamous &quot;underarm bowling incident&quot; occurred during a match in 1981, in which the Australian bowler, Trevor Chappell, took advantage of the fact that underarm bowling was still legal by rolling the ball along the ground. By doing so he avoided the possibility that the New Zealand batter, Brian McKechnie, would score a six from the last ball to tie the match, as the bat would not be able to hit the ball high enough to score a six.

As a result of this incident underarm bowling was subsequently made illegal in all grades of cricket, except by prior agreement of both teams, as it was not considered to be within the spirit of the game.

==The bowling action==

Bowling the ball is distinguished from simply throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition.

Originally, this definition said that the elbow joint must not straighten out during the bowling action. Bowlers generally hold their elbows fully extended and rotate the arm vertically about the shoulder joint to impart velocity to the ball, releasing it near the top of the arc. Flexion at the elbow is not allowed, but any extension of the elbow was deemed to be a throw and would be liable to be called a no-ball. This was thought to be possible only if the bowler&#x27;s elbow was originally held in a slightly flexed position.

In 2005, this definition was deemed to be physically impossible by a scientific investigative commission. Biomechanical studies that showed that &quot;almost&quot; all bowlers extend their elbows somewhat throughout the bowling action, because the stress of swinging the arm around &quot;hyperextends&quot; the elbow joint. A guideline was introduced to allow extensions or hyperextensions of angles up to 15 degrees before deeming the ball illegally thrown.

Bowling actions are typically divided into &quot;side on&quot; and &quot;front on&quot; actions. In the side on action, the back foot lands parallel to the bowling crease and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking over his front shoulder. In the front on action, the back foot lands pointing down the pitch and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking inside the line of his front arm. Many bowlers operate with a &quot;mid-way&quot; action with the back foot landing at roughly 45 degrees and the upper body aligned somewhere between side on and front on. This differs from a &quot;mixed&quot; action, which mixes distinct elements of both side on and front on actions, and is generally discouraged amongst young bowlers as it can lead to problems in later life due to the twisting of the back inherent in the action.

==Goals of bowling==
In a game of cricket, the ultimate priority of the fielding side is to restrict the total number of runs scored by the batting side, and the actions of the bowlers will be fundamental to achieving this objective. The primary means of achieving this is by dismissing the batting side by getting all ten of the opposition wickets as quickly as possible. A secondary objective will be to keep the batting side&#x27;s run rate as low as possible. In fact, in most forms of cricket, the twin aims of the fielding side are targeted concurrently, as the achievement of one aim tends to have a positive effect upon the other. Taking regular opposition wickets will remove the better batters from the crease, typically leading to a slowing of the scoring rate. Conversely, slowing the scoring rate can put additional pressure on the batters and force them into taking extra risks, which will often lead to wickets.

Depending upon the format of the match, these two strategies will be given different weights. In an unlimited, timed or declaration match, the main aim of the bowling attack will be to take wickets, so attacking bowling and fielding strategies will be used. In a limited overs match, this aim will also be supplemented by the secondary need to prevent the batting side from scoring quickly, so more defensive strategies will be used. In general, the shorter the number of overs per side, the more priority will be given to this secondary target of maintaining a low run-rate. It is also highly probable that the need for attacking or defensive strategies can switch frequently as a cricket match progresses. It is the sign of a good cricket captain to be able to tell which strategy is most appropriate in any set of circumstances and the best way of implementing it.

==Bowling tactics==
The simultaneous twin objectives of bowling are to take wickets and prevent run scoring opportunities. Both objectives are achieved through the underlying aim of bowling the ball in such a way that the batter is unable to connect with the ball in the middle of the bat and control its movement after contact. There are three distinct means of achieving this aim: by bowling the ball on a good line and length, by bowling with sufficient pace that the batter struggles to react to the delivery, or by bowling the ball in such a way that it has lateral movement as it approaches the batter, either in the air or off the ground. A good bowler may be able to combine two of these skills, a truly great bowler may be able to combine all three.

===Line and length===
The fundamental skill of bowling on a good length incorporates the ability to pitch the ball such a distance from the batter that he is unable to move forward and drive the ball on the half volley, and is also unable to step back and play the ball on the back foot. This removes many of the batter&#x27;s attacking options, and also increases the probability of misjudging a delivery and losing the wicket. A good length delivery is one in which the ball has had sufficient time to move far enough off the pitch to beat the bat but the batter has not had time to react to the movement and adjust the shot. The faster the bowler and the greater the movement he is able to generate, the larger the area of the pitch that can be designated an effective &quot;good&quot; length.

Other areas of the pitch may also often be used as a variation to a good length delivery. Primarily these are the yorker, in which the ball is bowled directly at the batter&#x27;s feet as a surprise delivery intended to dismiss the batter bowled, and the bouncer in which the ball is bowled on such a short length that it rises towards the batter&#x27;s throat or head as a means of physical intimidation. But the height of an attempted yorker or full toss must not be higher than the batter&#x27;s waist, or else it will be called a no-ball beamer, which could have bowlers banned from the match.

The line a bowler chooses to bowl will depend on several factors: the movement he is generating on the ball, the shots the batter is able to play, and the field the captain has set. The two most common tactics are to either bowl directly at the stumps, or to bowl 3 inches to 6 inches outside the line of off stump. Bowling at the stumps is an attacking tactic with the intention of dismissing the batter bowled or lbw. It can also be used as a defensive tactic, as the batter will feel less able to play risky shots knowing that he will be dismissed should he miss the ball. Bowling outside off stump is known as &quot;the corridor of uncertainty&quot;. When done well, this line may confuse the batter into whether to defend the ball or leave it, and may tempt him to play away from his body with his head not in line with the ball. The main aim of this tactic is to dismiss the batter caught by the wicketkeeper or in the slips. Other bowling variations, such as bowling wide of off stump or bowling at leg stump are generally seen as negative and defensive tactics.

Some different types of bowling tactic:
*Bodyline
*Leg theory
*Off theory

===Pace and movement===
Other than the ability to land the ball on a strategically optimum line and length, the main weapons of the bowler are his ability to move the ball sideways as it approaches the batter and his ability to deliver the ball at a high velocity.

The velocities of cricket bowlers vary between . In professional cricket, a bowler in the 40–60 mph range would be said to be a slow bowler, in the 60–80 mph range a medium pace bowler, and a bowler 80 mph+ a fast bowler. In the amateur game, these distinctions would be approximately 10 mph slower. Many professional fast bowlers are able to reach speeds of over 85 mph, with a handful of bowlers in the world able to bowl at 95 mph+. The ability to react to a cricket ball travelling at 85 mph is a skill that only professional and high level amateur cricketers possess. The pace of a bowler not only challenges the reaction speed of the batter, but also his physical courage. Fast bowlers are able to exploit this by bowling bouncers, either regularly or as an occasional surprise delivery.

Bowlers are also able to get the ball to move sideways by using either &quot;spin&quot; or &quot;swing&quot;. Adding a spin to a cricket ball will make it deviate due to the Magnus effect in its flight (like a slider in baseball), and then produce sideways movement off the ground. Swing is obtained by using air pressure differences caused by angling the seam of the cricket ball to produce a lateral movement in the air. Fast bowlers will generally only use swing to obtain movement, but medium pace and slow bowlers will often use a combination of the two. The intention is that in creating movement in the delivery, the batter will misjudge the line of the ball as it arrives, causing him to miss it entirely, in which case he may be dismissed bowled or lbw, or miss-hit it, in which case he may be out caught.

To avoid becoming predictable, a bowler will typically bowl a variety of different deliveries with different combinations of pace and movement. A tactically astute bowler may be able to spot a potential weakness in a batter that a particular delivery may be able to exploit. Bowlers will often also bowl deliveries in preplanned sets, with the intention of dismissing the batter with the final delivery in the set. This is known as &quot;setting a trap&quot; for the batter. batters and bowlers will often also engage in a game of &quot;cat and mouse&quot;, in which the bowler varies his tactics to try and trap and dismiss the batter, but the batter also keeps adjusting his tactics in response.

== Limited overs ==

In limited overs cricket, there is a limitation on the number of overs each bowler can bowl. This number depends on the match length, and is usually 20% of the total overs in the innings. For example, the usual limit for twenty-over cricket is four overs per bowler, for forty-over cricket eight per bowler and for fifty-over cricket ten per bowler. There is, however, no limit on the number of overs each bowler may bowl in first-class cricket matches, except that no two overs can be bowled consecutively thus restricting any one bowler from a maximum of 50% (plus 1 over) of each innings total. The rule also applies in terms of breaks within a Test innings (Drinks, Lunch and Tea breaks, end of day and beginning of next day). The rule can only be broken if one finishes the end of the previous match starts the next match.

<doc id="51879" wikidata="Q39524" url="?curid=51879" title="Gamal Abdel Nasser">
<text>Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein (15 January 1918 – 28 September 1970) was an Egyptian military officer and politician who served as the second president of Egypt from 1954 until his death in 1970. Nasser led the Egyptian revolution of 1952 and introduced far-reaching land reforms the following year. Following a 1954 assassination attempt on his life by a Muslim Brotherhood member, he cracked down on the organization, put President Mohamed Naguib under house arrest and assumed executive office. He was formally elected president in June 1956.

Nasser&#x27;s popularity in Egypt and the Arab world skyrocketed after his nationalization of the Suez Canal Company and his political victory in the subsequent Suez Crisis, known in Egypt as the &quot;Tripartite Aggression&quot;. Calls for pan-Arab unity under his leadership increased, culminating with the formation of the United Arab Republic with Syria from 1958 to 1961. In 1962, Nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser&#x27;s supporters gained power in several Arab countries, but he became embroiled in the North Yemen Civil War, and eventually the much larger Arab Cold War. He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt&#x27;s defeat by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself prime minister, launched the War of Attrition to regain the Israeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula, begun a process of depoliticizing the military, and issued a set of political liberalization reforms. After the conclusion of the 1970 Arab League summit, Nasser suffered a heart attack and died. His funeral in Cairo drew five to six million mourners, and prompted an outpouring of grief across the Arab world.

Nasser remains an iconic figure in the Arab world, particularly for his strides towards social justice and Arab unity, his modernization policies, and his anti-imperialist efforts. His presidency also encouraged and coincided with an Egyptian cultural boom, and the launching of large industrial projects, including the Aswan Dam, and Helwan city. Nasser&#x27;s detractors criticize his authoritarianism, his human rights violations, his antisemitism, and the dominance of the military over civil institutions that characterised his tenure, establishing a pattern of military and dictatorial rule in Egypt which has persisted, nearly uninterrupted, to the present day.

== Early life ==
Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein was born in Bakos, Alexandria, Egypt on 15 January 1918, a year before the tumultuous events of the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. Nasser&#x27;s father was a postal worker born in Beni Mur in Upper Egypt, and raised in Alexandria, and his mother&#x27;s family came from Mallawi, el-Minya. His parents had married in 1917. Nasser had two brothers, Izz al-Arab and al-Leithi. Nasser&#x27;s biographers Robert Stephens and Said Aburish wrote that Nasser&#x27;s family believed strongly in the &quot;Arab notion of glory&quot;, since the name of Nasser&#x27;s brother, Izz al-Arab, translates to &quot;Glory of the Arabs&quot;.

Nasser&#x27;s family traveled frequently due to his father&#x27;s work. In 1921, they moved to Asyut and, in 1923, to Khatatba, where Nasser&#x27;s father ran a post office. Nasser attended a primary school for the children of railway employees until 1924, when he was sent to live with his paternal uncle in Cairo, and to attend the Nahhasin elementary school.

Nasser exchanged letters with his mother and visited her on holidays. He stopped receiving messages at the end of April 1926. Upon returning to Khatatba, he learned that his mother had died after giving birth to his third brother, Shawki, and that his family had kept the news from him. Nasser later stated that &quot;losing her this way was a shock so deep that time failed to remedy&quot;. He adored his mother and the injury of her death deepened when his father remarried before the year&#x27;s end.

In 1928, Nasser went to Alexandria to live with his maternal grandfather and attend the city&#x27;s Attarin elementary school. He left in 1929 for a private boarding school in Helwan, and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin secondary school and to join his father, who was working for the city&#x27;s postal service. It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism. After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square, he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose. The protest, organized by the ultranationalist Young Egypt Society, called for the end of colonialism in Egypt in the wake of the 1923 Egyptian constitution&#x27;s annulment by Prime Minister Isma&#x27;il Sidqi. Nasser was arrested and detained for a night before his father bailed him out. Nasser joined the paramilitary wing of the group, known as the Green Shirts, for a brief period in 1934. His association with the group and active role in student demonstrations during this period &quot;imbued him with a fierce Egyptian nationalism&quot;, according to the historian James Jankowski.

When his father was transferred to Cairo in 1933, Nasser joined him and attended al-Nahda al-Masria school. He took up acting in school plays for a brief period and wrote articles for the school&#x27;s paper, including a piece on French philosopher Voltaire titled &quot;Voltaire, the Man of Freedom&quot;. On 13 November 1935, Nasser led a student demonstration against British rule, protesting against a statement made four days prior by UK foreign minister Samuel Hoare that rejected prospects for the 1923 Constitution&#x27;s restoration. Two protesters were killed and Nasser received a graze to the head from a policeman&#x27;s bullet. The incident garnered his first mention in the press: the nationalist newspaper &quot;Al Gihad&quot; reported that Nasser led the protest and was among the wounded. On 12 December, the new king, Farouk, issued a decree restoring the constitution.

Nasser&#x27;s involvement in political activity increased throughout his school years, such that he only attended 45 days of classes during his last year of secondary school. Despite it having the almost unanimous backing of Egypt&#x27;s political forces, Nasser strongly objected to the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty because it stipulated the continued presence of British military bases in the country. Nonetheless, political unrest in Egypt declined significantly and Nasser resumed his studies at al-Nahda, where he received his leaving certificate later that year.

=== Early influences ===
Aburish asserts that Nasser was not distressed by his frequent relocations, which broadened his horizons and showed him Egyptian society&#x27;s class divisions. His own social status was well below the wealthy Egyptian elite, and his discontent with those born into wealth and power grew throughout his lifetime. Nasser spent most of his spare time reading, particularly in 1933, when he lived near the National Library of Egypt. He read the Qur&#x27;an, the sayings of Muhammad, the lives of the Sahaba (Muhammad&#x27;s companions), the biographies of nationalist leaders Napoleon, Atatürk, Otto von Bismarck and Garibaldi, and the autobiography of Winston Churchill.

Nasser was greatly influenced by Egyptian nationalism, as espoused by politician Mustafa Kamel, poet Ahmed Shawqi, and his anti-colonialist instructor at the Royal Military Academy, Aziz al-Masri, to whom Nasser expressed his gratitude in a 1961 newspaper interview. He was especially influenced by Egyptian writer Tawfiq al-Hakim&#x27;s novel &quot;Return of the Spirit&quot;, in which al-Hakim wrote that the Egyptian people were only in need of a &quot;man in whom all their feelings and desires will be represented, and who will be for them a symbol of their objective&quot;. Nasser later credited the novel as his inspiration to launch the coup d&#x27;état that began the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.

== Military career ==
In 1937, Nasser applied to the Royal Military Academy for army officer training, but his police record of anti-government protest initially blocked his entry. Disappointed, he enrolled in the law school at King Fuad University, but quit after one semester to reapply to the Military Academy. From his readings, Nasser, who frequently spoke of &quot;dignity, glory, and freedom&quot; in his youth, became enchanted with the stories of national liberators and heroic conquerors; a military career became his chief priority.

Convinced that he needed a &quot;wasta&quot;, or an influential intermediary to promote his application above the others, Nasser managed to secure a meeting with Under-Secretary of War Ibrahim Khairy Pasha, the person responsible for the academy&#x27;s selection board, and requested his help. Khairy Pasha agreed and sponsored Nasser&#x27;s second application, which was accepted in late 1937. Nasser focused on his military career from then on, and had little contact with his family. At the academy, he met Abdel Hakim Amer and Anwar Sadat, both of whom became important aides during his presidency. After graduating from the academy in July 1938, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry, and posted to Mankabad. It was here that Nasser and his closest comrades, including Sadat and Amer, first discussed their dissatisfaction at widespread corruption in the country and their desire to topple the monarchy. Sadat would later write that because of his &quot;energy, clear-thinking, and balanced judgement&quot;, Nasser emerged as the group&#x27;s natural leader.

In 1941, Nasser was posted to Khartoum, Sudan, which was part of Egypt at the time. Nasser returned to Egypt in September 1942 after a brief stay in Sudan, then secured a position as an instructor in the Cairo Royal Military Academy in May 1943. In February 1942, in what became known as the Abdeen Palace Incident, British soldiers and tanks surrounded King Farouk&#x27;s palace to compel the King to dismiss Prime Minister Hussein Sirri Pasha in favour of Mostafa El-Nahas, whom the United Kingdom government felt would be more sympathetic to their war effort against the Axis. The British Ambassador, Miles Lampson, marched into the palace, and threatened the King with the bombardment of his palace, his removal as king, and his exile from Egypt unless he conceded to the British demands. Ultimately, the 22 year old King submitted, and appointed El-Nahas. Nasser saw the incident as a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty and wrote, &quot;I am ashamed that our army has not reacted against this attack&quot;, and wished for &quot;calamity&quot; to overtake the British. Nasser was accepted into the General Staff College later that year. He began to form a group of young military officers with strong nationalist sentiments who supported some form of revolution. Nasser stayed in touch with the group&#x27;s members primarily through Amer, who continued to seek out interested officers within the Egyptian Armed Force&#x27;s various branches and presented Nasser with a complete file on each of them.

=== 1948 Arab–Israeli War ===
Nasser&#x27;s first battlefield experience was in Palestine during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He initially volunteered to serve with the Arab Higher Committee (AHC) led by Mohammad Amin al-Husayni. Nasser met with and impressed al-Husayni, but was ultimately refused entry to the AHC&#x27;s forces by the Egyptian government for reasons that were unclear.

In May 1948, following the British withdrawal, King Farouk sent the Egyptian army into Israel, with Nasser serving as a staff officer of the 6th Infantry Battalion. During the war, he wrote of the Egyptian army&#x27;s unpreparedness, saying &quot;our soldiers were dashed against fortifications&quot;. Nasser was deputy commander of the Egyptian forces that secured the Faluja pocket (commanded by Said Taha Bey nicknamed the &quot;Sudanese tiger&quot; by the Israelis). On 12 July, he was lightly wounded in the fighting. By August, his brigade was surrounded by the Israeli Army. Appeals for help from Transjordan&#x27;s Arab Legion went unheeded, but the brigade refused to surrender. Negotiations between Israel and Egypt finally resulted in the ceding of Faluja to Israel. According to veteran journalist Eric Margolis, the defenders of Faluja, &quot;including young army officer Gamal Abdel Nasser, became national heroes&quot; for enduring Israeli bombardment while isolated from their command.

Still stationed after the war in the Faluja enclave, Nasser agreed to an Israeli request to identify 67 killed soldiers of the &quot;religious platoon&quot;. The expedition was led by Rabbi Shlomo Goren and Nasser personally accompanied him, ordering the Egyptian soldiers to stand at attention. They spoke briefly, and according to Goren, after learning what the square phylacteries found with the soldiers were, Nasser told him that he &quot;now understands their courageous stand&quot;. During an interview on Israeli TV in 1971, Rabbi Goren claimed the two agreed to meet again when the time of peace comes.

The Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum hosted a public celebration for the officers&#x27; return despite reservations from the royal government, which had been pressured by the British to prevent the reception. The apparent difference in attitude between the government and the general public increased Nasser&#x27;s determination to topple the monarchy. Nasser had also felt bitter that his brigade had not been relieved despite the resilience it displayed. He started writing his book &quot;Philosophy of the Revolution&quot; during the siege.

After the war, Nasser returned to his role as an instructor at the Royal Military Academy. He sent emissaries to forge an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood in October 1948, but soon concluded that the religious agenda of the Brotherhood was not compatible with his nationalism. From then on, Nasser prevented the Brotherhood&#x27;s influence over his cadres&#x27; activities without severing ties with the organization. Nasser was sent as a member of the Egyptian delegation to Rhodes in February 1949 to negotiate a formal armistice with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be humiliating, particularly because the Israelis were able to easily occupy the Eilat region while negotiating with the Arabs in March.

== Revolution ==

=== Free Officers ===

Nasser&#x27;s return to Egypt coincided with Husni al-Za&#x27;im&#x27;s Syrian coup d&#x27;état. Its success and evident popular support among the Syrian people encouraged Nasser&#x27;s revolutionary pursuits. Soon after his return, he was summoned and interrogated by Prime Minister Ibrahim Abdel Hadi regarding suspicions that he was forming a secret group of dissenting officers. According to secondhand reports, Nasser convincingly denied the allegations. Abdel Hadi was also hesitant to take drastic measures against the army, especially in front of its chief of staff, who was present during the interrogation, and subsequently released Nasser. The interrogation pushed Nasser to speed up his group&#x27;s activities.

After 1949, the group adopted the name &quot;Association of Free Officers&quot; and advocated &quot;little else but freedom and the restoration of their country&#x27;s dignity&quot;. Nasser organized the Free Officers&#x27; founding committee, which eventually comprised fourteen men from different social and political backgrounds, including representation from Young Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Communist Party, and the aristocracy. Nasser was unanimously elected chairman of the organization.

In the 1950 parliamentary elections, the Wafd Party of el-Nahhas gained a victory—mostly due to the absence of the Muslim Brotherhood, which boycotted the elections—and was perceived as a threat by the Free Officers as the Wafd had campaigned on demands similar to their own. Accusations of corruption against Wafd politicians began to surface, however, breeding an atmosphere of rumor and suspicion that consequently brought the Free Officers to the forefront of Egyptian politics. By then, the organization had expanded to around ninety members. According to Khaled Mohieddin, &quot;nobody knew all of them and where they belonged in the hierarchy except Nasser&quot;. Nasser felt that the Free Officers were not ready to move against the government and, for nearly two years, he did little beyond officer recruitment and underground news bulletins.

On 11 October 1951, the Wafd government abrogated the unpopular Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 by which the United Kingdom had the right to maintain its military forces in the Suez Canal Zone. The popularity of this move, as well as that of government-sponsored guerrilla attacks against the British, put pressure on Nasser to act. According to Sadat, Nasser decided to wage &quot;a large scale assassination campaign&quot;. In January 1952, he and Hassan Ibrahim attempted to kill the royalist general Hussein Sirri Amer by firing their submachine guns at his car as he drove through the streets of Cairo. Instead of killing the general, the attackers wounded an innocent female passerby. Nasser recalled that her wails &quot;haunted&quot; him and firmly dissuaded him from undertaking similar actions in the future.

Sirri Amer was close to King Farouk, and was nominated for the presidency of the Officer&#x27;s Club—normally a ceremonial office—with the king&#x27;s backing. Nasser was determined to establish the independence of the army from the monarchy, and with Amer as the intercessor, resolved to field a nominee for the Free Officers. They selected Mohamed Naguib, a popular general who had offered his resignation to Farouk in 1942 over British high-handedness and was wounded three times in the Palestine War. Naguib won overwhelmingly and the Free Officers, through their connection with a leading Egyptian daily, &quot;al-Misri&quot;, publicized his victory while praising the nationalistic spirit of the army.

=== Revolution of 1952 ===
On 25 January 1952, at a time of growing fedayeen attacks on British forces occupying the Suez Canal Zone, some 7,000 British soldiers attacked the main police station in the Canal city Ismailia. In the ensuing battle, which lasted two hours, 50 Egyptian policeman were killed, sparking outrage across Egypt, and the Cairo Fire riots which left 76 people dead. Afterwards, Nasser published a simple six-point program in &quot;Rose al-Yūsuf&quot; to dismantle feudalism and British influence in Egypt. In May, Nasser received word that Farouk knew the names of the Free Officers and intended to arrest them; he immediately entrusted Free Officer Zakaria Mohieddin with the task of planning the government takeover by army units loyal to the association.

The Free Officers&#x27; intention was not to install themselves in government, but to re-establish a parliamentary democracy. Nasser did not believe that a low-ranking officer like himself (a lieutenant colonel) would be accepted by the Egyptian people, and so selected General Naguib to be his &quot;boss&quot; and lead the coup in name. The revolution they had long sought was launched on 22 July and was declared a success the next day. The Free Officers seized control of all government buildings, radio stations, and police stations, as well as army headquarters in Cairo. While many of the rebel officers were leading their units, Nasser donned civilian clothing to avoid detection by royalists and moved around Cairo monitoring the situation. In a move to stave off foreign intervention two days before the revolution, Nasser had notified the American and British governments of his intentions, and both had agreed not to aid Farouk. Under pressure from the Americans, Nasser had agreed to exile the deposed king with an honorary ceremony.

On 18 June 1953, the monarchy was abolished and the Republic of Egypt declared, with Naguib as its first president. According to Aburish, after assuming power, Nasser and the Free Officers expected to become the &quot;guardians of the people&#x27;s interests&quot; against the monarchy and the pasha class while leaving the day-to-day tasks of government to civilians. They asked former prime minister Ali Maher to accept reappointment to his previous position, and to form an all-civilian cabinet. The Free Officers then governed as the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) with Naguib as chairman and Nasser as vice-chairman. Relations between the RCC and Maher grew tense, however, as the latter viewed many of Nasser&#x27;s schemes—agrarian reform, abolition of the monarchy, reorganization of political parties—as too radical, culminating in Maher&#x27;s resignation on 7 September. Naguib assumed the additional role of prime minister, and Nasser that of deputy prime minister. In September, the Agrarian Reform Law was put into effect. In Nasser&#x27;s eyes, this law gave the RCC its own identity and transformed the coup into a revolution.

Preceding the reform law, in August 1952, communist-led riots broke out at textile factories in Kafr el-Dawwar, leading to a clash with the army that left nine people dead. While most of the RCC insisted on executing the riot&#x27;s two ringleaders, Nasser opposed this. Nonetheless, the sentences were carried out. The Muslim Brotherhood supported the RCC, and after Naguib&#x27;s assumption of power, demanded four ministerial portfolios in the new cabinet. Nasser turned down their demands and instead hoped to co-opt the Brotherhood by giving two of its members, who were willing to serve officially as independents, minor ministerial posts.

== Road to presidency ==

=== Disputes with Naguib ===

In January 1953, Nasser overcame opposition from Naguib and banned all political parties, creating a one-party system under the Liberation Rally, a loosely structured movement whose chief task was to organize pro-RCC rallies and lectures, with Nasser its secretary-general. Despite the dissolution order, Nasser was the only RCC member who still favored holding parliamentary elections, according to his fellow officer Abdel Latif Boghdadi. Although outvoted, he still advocated holding elections by 1956. In March 1953, Nasser led the Egyptian delegation negotiating a British withdrawal from the Suez Canal.

When Naguib began showing signs of independence from Nasser by distancing himself from the RCC&#x27;s land reform decrees and drawing closer to Egypt&#x27;s established political forces, namely the Wafd and the Brotherhood, Nasser resolved to depose him. In June, Nasser took control of the interior ministry post from Naguib loyalist Sulayman Hafez, and pressured Naguib to conclude the abolition of the monarchy.

On 25 February 1954, Naguib announced his resignation after the RCC held an official meeting without his presence two days prior. On 26 February, Nasser accepted the resignation, put Naguib under house arrest, and the RCC proclaimed Nasser as both RCC chairman and prime minister. As Naguib intended, a mutiny immediately followed, demanding Naguib&#x27;s reinstatement and the RCC&#x27;s dissolution. While visiting the striking officers at Military Headquarters (GHQ) to call for the mutiny&#x27;s end, Nasser was initially intimidated into accepting their demands. However, on 27 February, Nasser&#x27;s supporters in the army launched a raid on the GHQ, ending the mutiny. Later that day, hundreds of thousands of protesters, mainly belonging to the Brotherhood, called for Naguib&#x27;s return and Nasser&#x27;s imprisonment. In response, a sizable group within the RCC, led by Khaled Mohieddin, demanded Naguib&#x27;s release and return to the presidency. Nasser acquiesced, but delayed Naguib&#x27;s reinstatement until 4 March, allowing him to promote Amer to Commander of the Armed Forces—a position formerly occupied by Naguib.

On 5 March, Nasser&#x27;s security coterie arrested thousands of participants in the uprising. As a ruse to rally opposition against a return to the pre-1952 order, the RCC decreed an end to restrictions on monarchy-era parties and the Free Officers&#x27; withdrawal from politics. The RCC succeeded in provoking the beneficiaries of the revolution, namely the workers, peasants, and petty bourgeois, to oppose the decrees, with one million transport workers launching a strike and thousands of peasants entering Cairo in protest in late March. Naguib sought to crack down on the protesters, but his requests were rebuffed by the heads of the security forces. On 29 March, Nasser announced the decrees&#x27; revocation in response to the &quot;impulse of the street&quot;. Between April and June, hundreds of Naguib&#x27;s supporters in the military were either arrested or dismissed, and Mohieddin was informally exiled to Switzerland to represent the RCC abroad. King Saud of Saudi Arabia attempted to mend relations between Nasser and Naguib, but to no avail.

=== Assuming chairmanship of RCC ===

On 26 October 1954, Muslim Brotherhood member Mahmoud Abdel-Latif attempted to assassinate Nasser while he was delivering a speech in Alexandria, broadcast to the Arab world by radio, to celebrate the British military withdrawal. The gunman was away from him and fired eight shots, but all missed Nasser. Panic broke out in the mass audience, but Nasser maintained his posture and raised his voice to appeal for calm. With great emotion he exclaimed the following:

My countrymen, my blood spills for you and for Egypt. I will live for your sake and die for the sake of your freedom and honor. Let them kill me; it does not concern me so long as I have instilled pride, honor, and freedom in you. If Gamal Abdel Nasser should die, each of you shall be Gamal Abdel Nasser ... Gamal Abdel Nasser is of you and from you and he is willing to sacrifice his life for the nation.
The crowd roared in approval and Arab audiences were electrified. The assassination attempt backfired, quickly playing into Nasser&#x27;s hands. Upon returning to Cairo, he ordered one of the largest political crackdowns in the modern history of Egypt, with the arrests of thousands of dissenters, mostly members of the Brotherhood, but also communists, and the dismissal of 140 officers loyal to Naguib. Eight Brotherhood leaders were sentenced to death, although the sentence of its chief ideologue, Sayyid Qutb, was commuted to a 15-year imprisonment. Naguib was removed from the presidency and put under house arrest, but was never tried or sentenced, and no one in the army rose to defend him. With his rivals neutralized, Nasser became the undisputed leader of Egypt.

Nasser&#x27;s street following was still too small to sustain his plans for reform and to secure him in office. To promote himself and the Liberation Rally, he gave speeches in a cross-country tour, and imposed controls over the country&#x27;s press by decreeing that all publications had to be approved by the party to prevent &quot;sedition&quot;. Both Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez, the leading Arab singers of the era, performed songs praising Nasser&#x27;s nationalism. Others produced plays denigrating his political opponents. According to his associates, Nasser orchestrated the campaign himself. Arab nationalist terms such &quot;Arab homeland&quot; and &quot;Arab nation&quot; frequently began appearing in his speeches in 1954–55, whereas prior he would refer to the Arab &quot;peoples&quot; or the &quot;Arab region&quot;. In January 1955, the RCC appointed him as their president, pending national elections.

Nasser made secret contacts with Israel in 1954–55, but determined that peace with Israel would be impossible, considering it an &quot;expansionist state that viewed the Arabs with disdain&quot;. On 28 February 1955, Israeli troops attacked the Egyptian-held Gaza Strip with the stated aim of suppressing Palestinian fedayeen raids. Nasser did not feel that the Egyptian Army was ready for a confrontation and did not retaliate militarily. His failure to respond to Israeli military action demonstrated the ineffectiveness of his armed forces and constituted a blow to his growing popularity. Nasser subsequently ordered the tightening of the blockade on Israeli shipping through the Straits of Tiran and restricted the use of airspace over the Gulf of Aqaba by Israeli aircraft in early September. The Israelis re-militarized the al-Auja Demilitarized Zone on the Egyptian border on 21 September.

Simultaneous with Israel&#x27;s February raid, the Baghdad Pact was formed between some regional allies of the UK. Nasser considered the Baghdad Pact a threat to his efforts to eliminate British military influence in the Middle East, and a mechanism to undermine the Arab League and &quot;perpetuate [Arab] subservience to Zionism and [Western] imperialism&quot;. Nasser felt that if he was to maintain Egypt&#x27;s regional leadership position he needed to acquire modern weaponry to arm his military. When it became apparent to him that Western countries would not supply Egypt under acceptable financial and military terms, Nasser turned to the Eastern Bloc and concluded a armaments agreement with Czechoslovakia on 27 September. Through the Czechoslovakian arms deal, the balance of power between Egypt and Israel was more or less equalized and Nasser&#x27;s role as the Arab leader defying the West was enhanced. The arms deal led to increased unease in the United States, where Nasser was compared to Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, causing it to strengthen its relations with Israel and become more wary of Egypt as a result.

=== Adoption of neutralism ===
At the Bandung Conference in Indonesia in late April 1955, Nasser was treated as the leading representative of the Arab countries and was one of the most popular figures at the summit. He had paid earlier visits to Pakistan (9 April), India (14 April), Burma, and Afghanistan on the way to Bandung, and previously cemented a treaty of friendship with India in Cairo on 6 April, strengthening Egyptian–Indian relations on the international policy and economic development fronts.

Nasser mediated discussions between the pro-Western, pro-Soviet, and neutralist conference factions over the composition of the &quot;Final Communique&quot; addressing colonialism in Africa and Asia and the fostering of global peace amid the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union. At Bandung, Nasser sought a proclamation for the avoidance of international defense alliances, support for the independence of Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco from French rule, support for the Palestinian right of return, and the implementation of UN resolutions regarding the Arab–Israeli conflict. He succeeded in lobbying the attendees to pass resolutions on each of these issues, notably securing the strong support of China and India.

Following Bandung, Nasser officially adopted the &quot;positive neutralism&quot; of Yugoslavian president Josip Broz Tito and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as a principal theme of Egyptian foreign policy regarding the Cold War. Nasser was welcomed by large crowds of people lining the streets of Cairo on his return to Egypt on 2 May and was widely heralded in the press for his achievements and leadership in the conference. Consequently, Nasser&#x27;s prestige was greatly boosted, as was his self-confidence and image.

=== 1956 constitution and presidency ===

With his domestic position considerably strengthened, Nasser was able to secure primacy over his RCC colleagues and gained relatively unchallenged decision-making authority, particularly over foreign policy.

In January 1956, the new Constitution of Egypt was drafted, entailing the establishment of a single-party system under the National Union (NU), a movement Nasser described as the &quot;cadre through which we will realize our revolution&quot;. The NU was a reconfiguration of the Liberation Rally, which Nasser determined had failed in generating mass public participation. In the new movement, Nasser attempted to incorporate more citizens, approved by local-level party committees, in order to solidify popular backing for his government. The NU would select a nominee for the presidential election whose name would be provided for public approval.

Nasser&#x27;s nomination for the post and the new constitution were put to public referendum on 23 June and each was approved by an overwhelming majority. A 350-member National Assembly was established, elections for which were held in July 1957. Nasser had ultimate approval over all the candidates. The constitution granted women&#x27;s suffrage, prohibited discrimination by sex, and entailed special protection for women in the workplace. Coinciding with the new constitution and Nasser&#x27;s presidency, the RCC dissolved itself and its members resigned their military commissions as part of the transition to civilian rule. During the deliberations surrounding the establishment of a new government, Nasser began a process of sidelining his rivals among the original Free Officers, while elevating his closest allies to high-ranking positions in the cabinet.

== Nationalization of the Suez Canal Company ==
After the three-year transition period ended with Nasser&#x27;s official assumption of power, his domestic and independent foreign policies increasingly collided with the regional interests of the UK and France. The latter condemned his strong support for Algerian independence, and the UK&#x27;s Eden government was agitated by Nasser&#x27;s campaign against the Baghdad Pact. In addition, Nasser&#x27;s adherence to neutralism regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, and arms deal with the Eastern bloc alienated the United States. On 19 July 1956, the US and UK abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the Aswan Dam, citing concerns that Egypt&#x27;s economy would be overwhelmed by the project.

Nasser was informed of the British–American withdrawal in a news statement while aboard a plane returning to Cairo from Belgrade, and took great offense. Although ideas for nationalizing the Suez Canal Company were in the offing after the UK agreed to withdraw its military from Egypt in 1954 (the last British troops left on 13 June 1956), journalist Mohamed Hassanein Heikal asserts that Nasser made the final decision to nationalize the company that operated the waterway between 19 and 20 July. Nasser himself would later state that he decided on 23 July, after studying the issue and deliberating with some of his advisers from the dissolved RCC, namely Boghdadi and technical specialist Mahmoud Younis, beginning on 21 July. The rest of the RCC&#x27;s former members were informed of the decision on 24 July, while the bulk of the cabinet was unaware of the nationalization scheme until hours before Nasser publicly announced it. According to Ramadan, Nasser&#x27;s decision to nationalize the canal was a solitary decision, taken without consultation.

On 26 July 1956, Nasser gave a speech in Alexandria announcing the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company as a means to fund the Aswan Dam project in light of the British–American withdrawal. In the speech, he denounced British imperialism in Egypt and British control over the canal company&#x27;s profits, and upheld that the Egyptian people had a right to sovereignty over the waterway, especially since &quot;120,000 Egyptians had died building it&quot;. The motion was technically in breach of the international agreement he had signed with the UK on 19 October 1954, although he ensured that all existing stockholders would be paid off.

The nationalization announcement was greeted very emotionally by the audience and, throughout the Arab world, thousands entered the streets shouting slogans of support. US ambassador Henry A. Byroade stated, &quot;I cannot overemphasize [the] popularity of the Canal Company nationalization within Egypt, even among Nasser&#x27;s enemies.&quot; Egyptian political scientist Mahmoud Hamad wrote that, prior to 1956, Nasser had consolidated control over Egypt&#x27;s military and civilian bureaucracies, but it was only after the canal&#x27;s nationalization that he gained near-total popular legitimacy and firmly established himself as the &quot;charismatic leader&quot; and &quot;spokesman for the masses not only in Egypt, but all over the Third World&quot;. According to Aburish, this was Nasser&#x27;s largest pan-Arab triumph at the time and &quot;soon his pictures were to be found in the tents of Yemen, the souks of Marrakesh, and the posh villas of Syria&quot;. The official reason given for the nationalization was that funds from the canal would be used for the construction of the dam in Aswan. That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping.

=== Suez Crisis ===
France and the UK, the largest shareholders in the Suez Canal Company, saw its nationalization as yet another hostile measure aimed at them by the Egyptian government. Nasser was aware that the canal&#x27;s nationalization would instigate an international crisis and believed the prospect of military intervention by the two countries was 80 percent likely. Nasser dismissed their claims, and believed that the UK would not be able to intervene militarily for at least two months after the announcement, and dismissed Israeli action as &quot;impossible&quot;. In early October, the UN Security Council met on the matter of the canal&#x27;s nationalization and adopted a resolution recognizing Egypt&#x27;s right to control the canal as long as it continued to allow passage through it for foreign ships. According to Heikal, after this agreement, &quot;Nasser estimated that the danger of invasion had dropped to 10 percent&quot;. Shortly thereafter, however, the UK, France, and Israel made a secret agreement to take over the Suez Canal, occupy the Suez Canal zone, and topple Nasser.

On 29 October 1956, Israeli forces crossed the Sinai Peninsula, overwhelmed Egyptian army posts, and quickly advanced to their objectives. Two days later, British and French planes bombarded Egyptian airfields in the canal zone. Nasser ordered the military&#x27;s high command to withdraw the Egyptian Army from Sinai to bolster the canal&#x27;s defenses. Moreover, he feared that if the armored corps was dispatched to confront the Israeli invading force and the British and French subsequently landed in the canal city of Port Said, Egyptian armor in the Sinai would be cut off from the canal and destroyed by the combined tripartite forces. Amer strongly disagreed, insisting that Egyptian tanks meet the Israelis in battle. The two had a heated exchange on 3 November, and Amer conceded. Nasser also ordered blockage of the canal by sinking or otherwise disabling forty-nine ships at its entrance.

Despite the commanded withdrawal of Egyptian troops, about 2,000 Egyptian soldiers were killed during engagement with Israeli forces, and some 5,000 Egyptian soldiers were captured by the Israeli Army. Amer and Salah Salem proposed requesting a ceasefire, with Salem further recommending that Nasser surrender himself to British forces. Nasser berated Amer and Salem, and vowed, &quot;Nobody is going to surrender.&quot; Nasser assumed military command. Despite the relative ease in which Sinai was occupied, Nasser&#x27;s prestige at home and among Arabs was undamaged. To counterbalance the Egyptian Army&#x27;s dismal performance, Nasser authorized the distribution of about 400,000 rifles to civilian volunteers and hundreds of militias were formed throughout Egypt, many led by Nasser&#x27;s political opponents.

It was at Port Said that Nasser saw a confrontation with the invading forces as being the strategic and psychological focal point of Egypt&#x27;s defense. A third infantry battalion and hundreds of national guardsmen were sent to the city as reinforcements, while two regular companies were dispatched to organize popular resistance. Nasser and Boghdadi traveled to the canal zone to boost the morale of the armed volunteers. According to Boghdadi&#x27;s memoirs, Nasser described the Egyptian Army as &quot;shattered&quot; as he saw the wreckage of Egyptian military equipment en route. When British and French forces landed in Port Said on 5–6 November, its local militia put up a stiff resistance, resulting in street-to-street fighting. The Egyptian Army commander in the city was preparing to request terms for a ceasefire, but Nasser ordered him to desist. The British-French forces managed to largely secure the city by 7 November. Between 750 and 1,000 Egyptians were killed in the battle for Port Said.

The US Eisenhower administration condemned the tripartite invasion, and supported UN resolutions demanding withdrawal and a United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) to be stationed in Sinai. Nasser commended Eisenhower, stating he played the &quot;greatest and most decisive role&quot; in stopping the &quot;tripartite conspiracy&quot;. By the end of December, British and French forces had totally withdrawn from Egyptian territory, while Israel completed its withdrawal in March 1957 and released all Egyptian prisoners of war. As a result of the Suez Crisis, Nasser brought in a set of regulations imposing rigorous requirements for residency and citizenship as well as forced expulsions, mostly affecting British and French nationals and Jews with foreign nationality, as well as many Egyptian Jews. Some 25,000 Jews, almost half of the Jewish community, left in 1956, mainly for Israel, Europe, the United States and South America.

After the fighting ended, Amer accused Nasser of provoking an unnecessary war and then blaming the military for the result. On 8 April, the canal was reopened, and Nasser&#x27;s political position was enormously enhanced by the widely perceived failure of the invasion and attempt to topple him. British diplomat Anthony Nutting claimed the crisis &quot;established Nasser finally and completely&quot; as the &quot;rayyes&quot; (president) of Egypt.

== Pan-Arabism and socialism ==

By 1957, pan-Arabism had become the dominant ideology in the Arab world, and the average Arab citizen considered Nasser their undisputed leader. Historian Adeed Dawisha credited Nasser&#x27;s status to his &quot;charisma, bolstered by his perceived victory in the Suez Crisis&quot;. The Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs radio station spread Nasser&#x27;s ideas of united Arab action throughout the Arabic-speaking world, so much so that historian Eugene Rogan wrote, &quot;Nasser conquered the Arab world by radio.&quot; Lebanese sympathizers of Nasser and the Egyptian embassy in Beirut—the press center of the Arab world—bought out Lebanese media outlets to further disseminate Nasser&#x27;s ideals. Egypt also expanded its policy of secondment, dispatching thousands of high-skilled Egyptian professionals (usually politically active teachers) across the region. Nasser also enjoyed the support of Arab nationalist civilian and paramilitary organizations throughout the region. His followers were numerous and well-funded, but lacked any permanent structure and organization. They called themselves &quot;Nasserites&quot;, despite Nasser&#x27;s objection to the label (he preferred the term &quot;Arab nationalists&quot;).

In January 1957, the US adopted the Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged to prevent the spread of communism and its perceived agents in the Middle East. Although Nasser was an opponent of communism in the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-Western states in the region. Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a counterweight. Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter Sulayman al-Nabulsi brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.

Relations between Nasser and King Hussein of Jordan deteriorated in April when Hussein implicated Nasser in two coup attempts against him—although Nasser&#x27;s involvement was never established—and dissolved al-Nabulsi&#x27;s cabinet. Nasser subsequently slammed Hussein on Cairo radio as being &quot;a tool of the imperialists&quot;. Relations with King Saud also became antagonistic as the latter began to fear that Nasser&#x27;s increasing popularity in Saudi Arabia was a genuine threat to the royal family&#x27;s survival. Despite opposition from the governments of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Lebanon, Nasser maintained his prestige among their citizens and those of other Arab countries.

By the end of 1957, Nasser nationalized all remaining British and French assets in Egypt, including the tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and phosphate industries. When efforts to offer tax incentives and attract outside investments yielded no tangible results, he nationalized more companies and made them a part of his economic development organization. He stopped short of total government control: two-thirds of the economy was still in private hands. This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization. Nasser initiated the Helwan steelworks, which subsequently became Egypt&#x27;s largest enterprise, providing the country with product and tens of thousands of jobs. Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.

=== United Arab Republic ===


Despite his popularity with the people of the Arab world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria&#x27;s leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in the Arab world, and particularly among Syrians.

As political instability grew in Syria, delegations from the country were sent to Nasser demanding immediate unification with Egypt. Nasser initially turned down the request, citing the two countries&#x27; incompatible political and economic systems, lack of contiguity, the Syrian military&#x27;s record of intervention in politics, and the deep factionalism among Syria&#x27;s political forces. However, in January 1958, a second Syrian delegation managed to convince Nasser of an impending communist takeover and a consequent slide to civil strife. Nasser subsequently opted for union, albeit on the condition that it would be a total political merger with him as its president, to which the delegates and Syrian president Shukri al-Quwatli agreed. On 1 February, the United Arab Republic (UAR) was proclaimed and, according to Dawisha, the Arab world reacted in &quot;stunned amazement, which quickly turned into uncontrolled euphoria.&quot; Nasser ordered a crackdown against Syrian communists, dismissing many of them from their governmental posts.

On a surprise visit to Damascus to celebrate the union on 24 February, Nasser was welcomed by crowds in the hundreds of thousands. Crown Prince Imam Badr of North Yemen was dispatched to Damascus with proposals to include his country in the new republic. Nasser agreed to establish a loose federal union with Yemen—the United Arab States—in place of total integration. While Nasser was in Syria, King Saud planned to have him assassinated on his return flight to Cairo. On 4 March, Nasser addressed the masses in Damascus and waved before them the Saudi check given to Syrian security chief and, unbeknownst to the Saudis, ardent Nasser supporter Abdel Hamid Sarraj to shoot down Nasser&#x27;s plane. As a consequence of Saud&#x27;s plot, he was forced by senior members of the Saudi royal family to informally cede most of his powers to his brother, King Faisal, a major Nasser opponent who advocated pan-Islamic unity over pan-Arabism.

A day after announcing the attempt on his life, Nasser established a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly (400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria) and the dissolution of all political parties. Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt, and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria. Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev. At the meeting, Khrushchev pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the Communist Party, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the UAR&#x27;s affairs. The matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries.

With the establishment of the United Arab Republic, the United States under President Eisenhower attempted to build better relations and initiate a rapprochement between the two countries, contrasting with the previously cautious stance of the American government towards Nasser. In particular, Nasser sought American assistance in his ideological cold war with Abdel Karim Qasim in Iraq and his ideology of Qasimism, which conflicted with Nasser&#x27;s pan-Arab nationalism. However, due to major ideological differences, no significant long-term working relationship developed between Nasser and Eisenhower.

=== Influence on the Arab world ===
In Lebanon, clashes between pro-Nasser factions and supporters of staunch Nasser opponent, then-President Camille Chamoun, culminated in civil strife by May. The former sought to unite with the UAR, while the latter sought Lebanon&#x27;s continued independence. Nasser delegated oversight of the issue to Sarraj, who provided limited aid to Nasser&#x27;s Lebanese supporters through money, light arms, and officer training—short of the large-scale support that Chamoun alleged. Nasser did not covet Lebanon, seeing it as a &quot;special case&quot;, but sought to prevent Chamoun from a second presidential term. In Oman, the Jebel Akhdar War between the rebels in the interior of Oman against the British-backed Sultanate of Oman prompted Nasser to support the rebels in what was considered a war against colonialism between 1954 and 1959.

On 14 July 1958, Iraqi army officers Abdel Karim Qasim and Abdel Salam Aref overthrew the Iraqi monarchy and, the next day, Iraqi prime minister and Nasser&#x27;s chief Arab antagonist, Nuri al-Said, was killed. The entire Iraqi royal family was killed, and Al-Said&#x27;s and Iraqi crown prince &#x27;Abd al-Ilah&#x27;s bodies were mutilated and dragged across Baghdad. Nasser recognized the new government and stated that &quot;any attack on Iraq was tantamount to an attack on the UAR&quot;. On 15 July, US marines landed in Lebanon, and British special forces in Jordan, upon the request of those countries&#x27; governments to prevent them from falling to pro-Nasser forces. Nasser felt that the revolution in Iraq left the road for pan-Arab unity unblocked. On 19 July, for the first time, he declared that he was opting for full Arab union, although he had no plan to merge Iraq with the UAR. While most members of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) favored Iraqi-UAR unity, Qasim sought to keep Iraq independent and resented Nasser&#x27;s large popular base in the country.

In the fall of 1958, Nasser formed a tripartite committee consisting of Zakaria Mohieddin, al-Hawrani, and Salah Bitar to oversee developments in Syria. By moving the latter two, who were Ba&#x27;athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how Syria should be run. He put Syria under Sarraj, who effectively reduced the province to a police state by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected to the introduction of Egyptian agricultural reform in Syria, as well as communists. Following the Lebanese election of Fuad Chehab in September 1958, relations between Lebanon and the UAR improved considerably. On 25 March 1959, Chehab and Nasser met at the Lebanese–Syrian border and compromised on an end to the Lebanese crisis.

Relations between Nasser and Qasim grew increasingly bitter on 9 March, after Qasim&#x27;s forces suppressed a rebellion in Mosul, launched a day earlier by a pro-Nasser Iraqi RCC officer backed by UAR authorities. Nasser had considered dispatching troops to aid his Iraqi sympathizers, but decided against it. He clamped down on Egyptian communist activity due to the key backing Iraqi communists provided Qasim. Several influential communists were arrested, including Nasser&#x27;s old comrade Khaled Mohieddin, who had been allowed to re-enter Egypt in 1956.

By December, the political situation in Syria was faltering and Nasser responded by appointing Amer as governor-general alongside Sarraj. Syria&#x27;s leaders opposed the appointment and many resigned from their government posts. Nasser later met with the opposition leaders and in a heated moment, exclaimed that he was the elected president of the UAR and those who did not accept his authority could &quot;walk away&quot;.

=== Collapse of the union and aftermath ===
Opposition to the union mounted among some of Syria&#x27;s key elements, namely the socioeconomic, political, and military elites. In response to Syria&#x27;s worsening economy, which Nasser attributed to its control by the bourgeoisie, in July 1961, Nasser decreed socialist measures that nationalized wide-ranging sectors of the Syrian economy. He also dismissed Sarraj in September to curb the growing political crisis. Aburish states that Nasser was not fully capable of addressing Syrian problems because they were &quot;foreign to him&quot;. In Egypt, the economic situation was more positive, with a GNP growth of 4.5 percent and a rapid growth of industry. In 1960, Nasser nationalized the Egyptian press, which had already been cooperating with his government, in order to steer coverage towards the country&#x27;s socioeconomic issues and galvanize public support for his socialist measures.

On 28 September 1961, secessionist army units launched a coup in Damascus, declaring Syria&#x27;s secession from the UAR. In response, pro-union army units in northern Syria revolted and pro-Nasser protests occurred in major Syrian cities. Nasser sent Egyptian Special Forces to Latakia to bolster his allies, but withdrew them two days later, citing a refusal to allow inter-Arab fighting. Addressing the UAR&#x27;s breakup on 5 October, Nasser accepted personal responsibility and declared that Egypt would recognize an elected Syrian government. He privately blamed interference by hostile Arab governments. According to Heikal, Nasser suffered something resembling a nervous breakdown after the dissolution of the union; he began to smoke more heavily and his health began to deteriorate.

=== Revival on regional stage ===

Nasser&#x27;s regional position changed unexpectedly when Yemeni officers led by Nasser supporter Abdullah al-Sallal overthrew Imam Badr of North Yemen on 27 September 1962. Al-Badr and his tribal partisans began receiving increasing support from Saudi Arabia to help reinstate the kingdom, while Nasser subsequently accepted a request by Sallal to militarily aid the new government on 30 September. Consequently, Egypt became increasingly embroiled in the drawn-out civil war, with 60,000 Egyptian soldiers deployed in North Yemen in March 1966. In August 1967, in order to make up for Egyptian losses during the Six-Day War, Nasser recalled 15,000 troops from North Yemen. As part of the Khartoum Resolution at the 1967 Arab League summit in the same month, Egypt announced that it was ready to withdraw all its soldiers from North Yemen and it did so by the end of 1967. 26,000 Egyptian soldiers were killed during the intervention. Most of Nasser&#x27;s old colleagues had questioned the wisdom of continuing the war, but Amer reassured Nasser of their coming victory. Nasser later remarked in 1968 that intervention in Yemen was a &quot;miscalculation&quot;.

In July 1962, Algeria became independent of France. As a staunch political and financial supporter of the Algerian independence movement, Nasser considered the country&#x27;s independence to be a personal victory. Amid these developments, a pro-Nasser clique in the Saudi royal family led by Prince Talal defected to Egypt, along with the Jordanian chief of staff, in early 1963.

On 8 February 1963, a military coup in Iraq led by a Ba&#x27;athist–Nasserist alliance toppled Qasim, who was subsequently shot dead. Abdel Salam Aref, a Nasserist, was chosen to be the new president. A similar alliance toppled the Syrian government on 8 March. On 14 March, the new Iraqi and Syrian governments sent Nasser delegations to push for a new Arab union. At the meeting, Nasser lambasted the Ba&#x27;athists for &quot;facilitating&quot; Syria&#x27;s split from the UAR, and asserted that he was the &quot;leader of the Arabs&quot;. A transitional unity agreement stipulating a federal system was signed by the parties on 17 April and the new union was set to be established in May 1965. However, the agreement fell apart weeks later when Syria&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athists purged Nasser&#x27;s supporters from the officers corps. A failed counter-coup by a Nasserist colonel followed, after which Nasser condemned the Ba&#x27;athists as &quot;fascists&quot;.
In January 1964, Nasser called for an Arab League summit in Cairo to establish a unified Arab response against Israel&#x27;s plans to divert the Jordan River&#x27;s waters for economic purposes, which Syria and Jordan deemed an act of war. Nasser blamed Arab divisions for what he deemed &quot;the disastrous situation&quot;. He discouraged Syria and Palestinian guerrillas from provoking the Israelis, conceding that he had no plans for war with Israel. During the summit, Nasser developed cordial relations with King Hussein, and ties were mended with the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Morocco. In May, Nasser moved to formally share his leadership position over the Palestine issue by initiating the creation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In practice, Nasser used the PLO to wield control over the Palestinian fedayeen. Its head was to be Ahmad Shukeiri, Nasser&#x27;s personal nominee.

After years of foreign policy coordination and developing ties, Nasser, President Sukarno of Indonesia, President Tito of Yugoslavia, and Prime Minister Nehru of India founded the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1961. Its declared purpose was to solidify international non-alignment and promote world peace amid the Cold War, end colonization, and increase economic cooperation among developing countries. In 1964, Nasser was made president of the NAM and held the second conference of the organization in Cairo.

Nasser played a significant part in the strengthening of African solidarity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, although his continental leadership role had increasingly passed to Algeria since 1962. During this period, Nasser made Egypt a refuge for anti-colonial leaders from several African countries and allowed the broadcast of anti-colonial propaganda from Cairo. Beginning in 1958, Nasser had a key role in the discussions among African leaders that led to the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.

== Modernization efforts and internal dissent ==
=== Al-Azhar ===
In 1961, Nasser sought to firmly establish Egypt as the leader of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist thinking. To achieve this, he initiated several reforms to modernize al-Azhar, which serves as the &quot;de facto&quot; leading authority in Sunni Islam, and to ensure its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative Wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia. Nasser had used al-Azhar&#x27;s most willing &quot;ulema&quot; (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood&#x27;s Islamic influence, starting in 1953.

Nasser instructed al-Azhar to create changes in its syllabus that trickled to the lower levels of Egyptian education, consequently allowing the establishment of coeducational schools and the introduction of evolution into school curriculum. The reforms also included the merger of religious and civil courts. Moreover, Nasser forced al-Azhar to issue a fatwā admitting Shia Muslims, Alawites, and Druze into mainstream Islam; for centuries prior, al-Azhar deemed them to be &quot;heretics&quot;.

=== Rivalry with Amer ===
Following Syria&#x27;s secession, Nasser grew concerned with Amer&#x27;s inability to train and modernize the army, and with the state within a state Amer had created in the military command and intelligence apparatus. In late 1961, Nasser established the Presidential Council and decreed it the authority to approve all senior military appointments, instead of leaving this responsibility solely to Amer. Moreover, he instructed that the primary criterion for promotion should be merit and not personal loyalties. Nasser retracted the initiative after Amer&#x27;s allies in the officers corps threatened to mobilize against him.

In early 1962 Nasser again attempted to wrest control of the military command from Amer. Amer responded by directly confronting Nasser for the first time and secretly rallying his loyalist officers. Nasser ultimately backed down, wary of a possible violent confrontation between the military and his civilian government. According to Boghdadi, the stress caused by the UAR&#x27;s collapse and Amer&#x27;s increasing autonomy forced Nasser, who already had diabetes, to practically live on painkillers from then on.

=== National Charter and second term ===
In October 1961, Nasser embarked on a major nationalization program for Egypt, believing the total adoption of socialism was the answer to his country&#x27;s problems and would have prevented Syria&#x27;s secession. In order to organize and solidify his popular base with Egypt&#x27;s citizens and counter the army&#x27;s influence, Nasser introduced the National Charter in 1962 and a new constitution. The charter called for universal health care, affordable housing, vocational schools, greater women&#x27;s rights and a family planning program, as well as widening the Suez Canal.

Nasser also attempted to maintain oversight of the country&#x27;s civil service to prevent it from inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state. New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management. Land reforms guaranteed the security of tenant farmers, promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty. As a result of the 1962 measures, government ownership of Egyptian business reached 51 percent, and the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers. Nasser&#x27;s tilt toward a Soviet-style system led his aides Boghdadi and Hussein el-Shafei to submit their resignations in protest.

During the presidential referendum in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected to a second term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt&#x27;s economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the &#x27;60s, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser&#x27;s appeal waned considerably.

== Six-Day War ==

In mid May 1967, the Soviet Union issued warnings to Nasser of an impending Israeli attack on Syria, although Chief of Staff Mohamed Fawzi considered the warnings to be &quot;baseless&quot;. According to Kandil, without Nasser&#x27;s authorization, Amer used the Soviet warnings as a pretext to dispatch troops to Sinai on 14 May, and Nasser subsequently demanded UNEF&#x27;s withdrawal. Earlier that day, Nasser received a warning from King Hussein of Israeli-American collusion to drag Egypt into war. The message had been originally received by Amer on 2 May, but was withheld from Nasser until the Sinai deployment on 14 May. Although in the preceding months, Hussein and Nasser had been accusing each other of avoiding a fight with Israel, Hussein was nonetheless wary that an Egyptian–Israeli war would risk the West Bank&#x27;s occupation by Israel. Nasser still felt that the US would restrain Israel from attacking due to assurances that he received from the US and Soviet Union. In turn, he also reassured both powers that Egypt would only act defensively.

On 21 May, Amer asked Nasser to order the Straits of Tiran blockaded, a move Nasser believed Israel would use as a &quot;casus belli&quot;. Amer reassured him that the army was prepared for confrontation, but Nasser doubted Amer&#x27;s assessment of the military&#x27;s readiness. According to Nasser&#x27;s vice president Zakaria Mohieddin, although &quot;Amer had absolute authority over the armed forces, Nasser had his ways of knowing what was really going on&quot;. Moreover, Amer anticipated an impending Israeli attack and advocated a preemptive strike. Nasser refused the call upon determination that the air force lacked pilots and Amer&#x27;s handpicked officers were incompetent. Still, Nasser concluded that if Israel attacked, Egypt&#x27;s quantitative advantage in manpower and arms could stave off Israeli forces for at least two weeks, allowing for diplomacy towards a ceasefire. Israel repeated declarations it had made in 1957 that any closure of the Straits would be considered an act of war, or justification for war, but Nasser closed the Straits to Israeli shipping on 22–23 May. Towards the end of May, Nasser increasingly exchanged his positions of deterrence for deference to the inevitability of war, under increased pressure to act by both the general Arab populace and various Arab governments. On 26 May Nasser declared, &quot;our basic objective will be to destroy Israel&quot;. On 30 May, King Hussein committed Jordan in an alliance with Egypt and Syria.
On the morning of 5 June, the Israeli Air Force struck Egyptian air fields, destroying much of the Egyptian Air Force. Before the day ended, Israeli armored units had cut through Egyptian defense lines and captured the town of el-Arish. The next day, Amer ordered the immediate withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Sinai—causing the majority of Egyptian casualties during the war. Israel quickly captured Sinai and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.

According to Sadat, it was only when the Israelis cut off the Egyptian garrison at Sharm el-Sheikh that Nasser became aware of the situation&#x27;s gravity. After hearing of the attack, he rushed to army headquarters to inquire about the military situation. The simmering conflict between Nasser and Amer subsequently came to the fore, and officers present reported the pair burst into &quot;a nonstop shouting match&quot;. The Supreme Executive Committee, set up by Nasser to oversee the conduct of the war, attributed the repeated Egyptian defeats to the Nasser–Amer rivalry and Amer&#x27;s overall incompetence. According to Egyptian diplomat Ismail Fahmi, who became foreign minister during Sadat&#x27;s presidency, the Israeli invasion and Egypt&#x27;s consequent defeat was a result of Nasser&#x27;s dismissal of all rational analysis of the situation and his undertaking of a series of irrational decisions.

=== Resignation and aftermath ===

During the first four days of the war, the general population of the Arab world believed Arab radio station fabrications of imminent Arab victory. On 9 June, Nasser appeared on television to inform Egypt&#x27;s citizens of their country&#x27;s defeat. He announced his resignation on television later that day, and ceded all presidential powers to his then-Vice President Zakaria Mohieddin, who had no prior information of this decision and refused to accept the post. It was in this resignation
speech that the Six Day War was first called the &quot;setback&quot;. The second sentence of his speech ran: &quot;We cannot hide from ourselves the fact that we have met with a grave setback [naksa] in the last few days&quot;—the &quot;naksa&quot; or &quot;setback&quot; for Egypt being the destruction of its armed forces, the loss of the entire Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza region, and the national humiliation and disgrace of losing a war to the vastly smaller Israeli Army.

Hundreds of thousands of sympathizers poured into the streets in mass demonstrations throughout Egypt and across the Arab world rejecting his resignation, chanting, &quot;We are your soldiers, Gamal!&quot; Nasser retracted his decision the next day.
On 11 July, Nasser replaced Amer with Mohamed Fawzi as general commander, over the protestations of Amer&#x27;s loyalists in the military, 600 of whom marched on army headquarters and demanded Amer&#x27;s reinstatement. After Nasser sacked thirty of the loyalists in response, Amer and his allies devised a plan to topple him on 27 August. Nasser was tipped off about their activities and, after several invitations, he convinced Amer to meet him at his home on 24 August. Nasser confronted Amer about the coup plot, which he denied before being arrested by Mohieddin. Amer committed suicide on 14 September. Despite his souring relationship with Amer, Nasser spoke of losing &quot;the person closest to [him]&quot;. Thereafter, Nasser began a process of depoliticizing the armed forces, arresting dozens of leading military and intelligence figures loyal to Amer.

At the 29 August Arab League summit in Khartoum, Nasser&#x27;s usual commanding position had receded as the attending heads of state expected Saudi King Faisal to lead. A ceasefire in the Yemen War was declared and the summit concluded with the Khartoum Resolution, which, according to Abd al Azim Ramadan, left only one option—a war with Israel.

The Soviet Union soon resupplied the Egyptian military with about half of its former arsenals and broke diplomatic relations with Israel. Nasser cut relations with the US following the war, and, according to Aburish, his policy of &quot;playing the superpowers against each other&quot; ended. In November, Nasser accepted UN Resolution 242, which called for Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from territories acquired in the war. His supporters claimed Nasser&#x27;s move was meant to buy time to prepare for another confrontation with Israel, while his detractors believed his acceptance of the resolution signaled a waning interest in Palestinian independence.

== Final years of presidency ==
=== Domestic reforms and governmental changes ===
Nasser appointed himself the additional roles of prime minister and supreme commander of the armed forces on 19 June 1967. Angry at the military court&#x27;s perceived leniency with air force officers charged with negligence during the 1967 war, workers and students launched protests calling for major political reforms in late February 1968. Nasser responded to the demonstrations, the most significant public challenge to his rule since workers&#x27; protests in March 1954, by removing most military figures from his cabinet and appointing eight civilians in place of several high-ranking members of the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). By 3 March, Nasser directed Egypt&#x27;s intelligence apparatus to focus on external rather than domestic espionage, and declared the &quot;fall of the mukhabarat state&quot;.

On 30 March, Nasser proclaimed a manifesto stipulating the restoration of civil liberties, greater parliamentary independence from the executive, major structural changes to the ASU, and a campaign to rid the government of corrupt elements. A public referendum approved the proposed measures in May, and held subsequent elections for the Supreme Executive Committee, the ASU&#x27;s highest decision-making body. Observers noted that the declaration signaled an important shift from political repression to liberalization, although its promises would largely go unfulfilled.

Nasser appointed Sadat and Hussein el-Shafei as his vice presidents in December 1969. By then, relations with his other original military comrades, namely Khaled and Zakaria Mohieddin and former vice president Sabri, had become strained. By mid-1970, Nasser pondered replacing Sadat with Boghdadi after reconciling with the latter.

=== War of Attrition and regional diplomatic initiatives ===

Meanwhile, in January 1968, Nasser commenced the War of Attrition to reclaim territory captured by Israel, ordering attacks against Israeli positions east of the then-blockaded Suez Canal. In March, Nasser offered Yasser Arafat&#x27;s Fatah movement arms and funds after their performance against Israeli forces in the Battle of Karameh that month. He also advised Arafat to think of peace with Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state comprising the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Nasser effectively ceded his leadership of the &quot;Palestine issue&quot; to Arafat.

Israel retaliated against Egyptian shelling with commando raids, artillery shelling and air strikes. This resulted in an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal&#x27;s western bank. Nasser ceased all military activities and began a program to build a network of internal defenses, while receiving the financial backing of various Arab states. The war resumed in March 1969. In November, Nasser brokered an agreement between the PLO and the Lebanese military that granted Palestinian guerrillas the right to use Lebanese territory to attack Israel.

In June 1970, Nasser accepted the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, which called for an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender. Following Nasser&#x27;s acceptance, Israel agreed to a ceasefire and Nasser used the lull in fighting to move surface-to-air missiles towards the canal zone.

Meanwhile, tensions in Jordan between an increasingly autonomous PLO and King Hussein&#x27;s government had been simmering; following the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings, a military campaign was launched to rout out PLO forces. The offensive elevated risks of a regional war and prompted Nasser to hold an emergency Arab League summit on 27 September in Cairo, where he forged a ceasefire.

== Death and funeral ==

As the Arab League summit closed on 28 September 1970, hours after escorting the last Arab leader to leave, Nasser suffered a heart attack. He was immediately transported to his house, where his physicians tended to him. Nasser died several hours later, around 6 p.m. at age 52. Heikal, Sadat, and Nasser&#x27;s wife Tahia were at his deathbed. According to his doctor, al-Sawi Habibi, Nasser&#x27;s likely cause of death was arteriosclerosis, varicose veins, and complications from long-standing diabetes. Nasser was also a heavy smoker with a family history of heart disease—two of his brothers died in their fifties from the same condition. The state of Nasser&#x27;s health was not known to the public prior to his death. He had previously suffered heart attacks in 1966 and September 1969.

Following the announcement of Nasser&#x27;s death, most Arabs were in a state of shock. Nasser&#x27;s funeral procession through Cairo on 1 October was attended by at least five million mourners. The procession to his burial site began at the old RCC headquarters with a flyover by MiG-21 jets. His flag-draped coffin was attached to a gun carriage pulled by six horses and led by a column of cavalrymen. All Arab heads of state attended, with the exception of Saudi King Faisal. King Hussein and Arafat cried openly, and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya fainted from emotional distress twice. A few major non-Arab dignitaries were present, including Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin and French Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas.

Almost immediately after the procession began, mourners engulfed Nasser&#x27;s coffin chanting, &quot;There is no God but Allah, and Nasser is God&#x27;s beloved... Each of us is Nasser.&quot; Police unsuccessfully attempted to quell the crowds and, as a result, most of the foreign dignitaries were evacuated. The final destination was the Nasr Mosque, which was afterwards renamed Abdel Nasser Mosque, where Nasser was buried.

Because of his ability to motivate nationalistic passions, &quot;men, women, and children wept and wailed in the streets&quot; after hearing of his death, according to Nutting. The general Arab reaction was of mourning, with thousands of people pouring onto the streets of major cities throughout the Arab world. Over a dozen people were killed in Beirut as a result of the chaos, and in Jerusalem, roughly 75,000 Arabs marched through the Old City chanting, &quot;Nasser will never die.&quot; As a testament to his unchallenged leadership of the Arab people, following his death, the headline of the Lebanese &quot;Le Jour&quot; read, &quot;One hundred million human beings—the Arabs—are orphans.&quot; Sherif Hetata, a former political prisoner and later member Nasser&#x27;s ASU, said that &quot;Nasser&#x27;s greatest achievement was his funeral. The world will never again see five million people crying together.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Nasser made Egypt fully independent of British influence, and the country became a major power in the developing world under his leadership. One of Nasser&#x27;s main domestic efforts was to establish social justice, which he deemed a prerequisite to liberal democracy. During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while feudalistic influence waned.

However, these advances came at the expense of civil liberties. In Nasser&#x27;s Egypt, the media were tightly controlled, mail was opened, and telephones were wiretapped. He was elected in 1956, 1958 and 1965 in plebiscites in which he was the sole candidate, each time claiming unanimous or near-unanimous support. With few exceptions, the legislature did little more than approve Nasser&#x27;s policies. As the legislature was made up almost entirely of government supporters, Nasser effectively held all governing power in the nation.

By the end of his presidency, employment and working conditions improved considerably, although poverty was still high in the country and substantial resources allocated for social welfare had been diverted to the war effort.

The national economy grew significantly through agrarian reform, major modernization projects such as the Helwan steel works and the Aswan Dam, and nationalization schemes such as that of the Suez Canal. However, the marked economic growth of the early 1960s took a downturn for the remainder of the decade, only recovering in 1970. Egypt experienced a &quot;golden age&quot; of culture during Nasser&#x27;s presidency, according to historian Joel Gordon, particularly in film, television, theater, radio, literature, fine arts, comedy, poetry, and music. Egypt under Nasser dominated the Arab world in these fields, producing cultural icons.

During Mubarak&#x27;s presidency, Nasserist political parties began to emerge in Egypt, the first being the Arab Democratic Nasserist Party (ADNP). The party carried minor political influence, and splits between its members beginning in 1995 resulted in the gradual establishment of splinter parties, including Hamdeen Sabahi&#x27;s 1997 founding of Al-Karama. Sabahi came in third place during the 2012 presidential election. Nasserist activists were among the founders of Kefaya, a major opposition force during Mubarak&#x27;s rule. On 19 September 2012, four Nasserist parties (the ADNP, Karama, the National Conciliation Party, and the Popular Nasserist Congress Party) merged to form the United Nasserist Party.

=== Public image ===
Nasser was known for his accessibility and direct relationship with ordinary Egyptians. His availability to the public, despite assassination attempts against him, was unparalleled among his successors. A skilled orator, Nasser gave 1,359 speeches between 1953 and 1970, a record for any Egyptian head of state. Historian Elie Podeh wrote that a constant theme of Nasser&#x27;s image was &quot;his ability to represent Egyptian authenticity, in triumph or defeat&quot;. The national press also helped to foster his popularity and profile—more so after the nationalization of state media. Historian Tarek Osman wrote:
The interplay in the Nasser &#x27;phenomenon&#x27; between genuine expression of popular feeling and state-sponsored propaganda may sometimes be hard to disentangle. But behind it lies a vital historical fact: that Gamal Abdel Nasser signifies the only truly Egyptian developmental project in the country&#x27;s history since the fall of the Pharaonic state. There had been other projects ... But this was different—in origin, meaning and impact. For Nasser was a man of the Egyptian soil who had overthrown the Middle East&#x27;s most established and sophisticated monarchy in a swift and bloodless move—to the acclaim of millions of poor, oppressed Egyptians—and ushered in a programme of &#x27;social justice&#x27;, &#x27;progress and development&#x27;, and &#x27;dignity&#x27;.

While Nasser was increasingly criticized by Egyptian intellectuals following the Six-Day War and his death in 1970, the general public was persistently sympathetic both during and after Nasser&#x27;s life. According to political scientist Mahmoud Hamad, writing in 2008, &quot;nostalgia for Nasser is easily sensed in Egypt and all Arab countries today&quot;. General malaise in Egyptian society, particularly during the Mubarak era, augmented nostalgia for Nasser&#x27;s presidency, which increasingly became associated with the ideals of national purpose, hope, social cohesion, and vibrant culture.

Until the present day, Nasser serves as an iconic figure throughout the Arab world, a symbol of Arab unity and dignity, and a towering figure in modern Middle Eastern history. He is also considered a champion of social justice in Egypt. &quot;Time&quot; writes that despite his mistakes and shortcomings, Nasser &quot;imparted a sense of personal worth and national pride that [Egypt and the Arabs] had not known for 400 years. This alone may have been enough to balance his flaws and failures.&quot;

Historian Steven A. Cook wrote in July 2013, &quot;Nasser&#x27;s heyday still represents, for many, the last time that Egypt felt united under leaders whose espoused principles met the needs of ordinary Egyptians.&quot; During the Arab Spring, which resulted in a revolution in Egypt, photographs of Nasser were raised in Cairo and Arab capitals during anti-government demonstrations. According to journalist Lamis Andoni, Nasser had become a &quot;symbol of Arab dignity&quot; during the mass demonstrations.

=== Criticism ===

Sadat declared his intention to &quot;continue the path of Nasser&quot; in his 7 October 1970 presidential inauguration speech, but began to depart from Nasserist policies as his domestic position improved following the 1973 October War. President Sadat&#x27;s Infitah policy sought to open Egypt&#x27;s economy for private investment. According to Heikal, ensuing anti-Nasser developments until the present day led to an Egypt &quot;[half] at war with Abdel-Nasser, half [at war] with Anwar El-Sadat&quot;.

Nasser&#x27;s Egyptian detractors considered him a dictator who thwarted democratic progress, imprisoned thousands of dissidents, and led a repressive administration responsible for numerous human rights violations. Islamists in Egypt, particularly members of the politically persecuted Brotherhood, viewed Nasser as oppressive, tyrannical, and demonic. Samer S. Shehata, who wrote an article on &quot;The Politics of Laughter: Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarek in Egyptian Political Jokes&quot; noted that &quot;with the new regime came the end of parliamentary politics and political freedoms, including the right to organize political parties, and freedoms of speech and the press&quot;. Liberal writer Tawfiq al-Hakim described Nasser as a &quot;confused Sultan&quot; who employed stirring rhetoric, but had no actual plan to achieve his stated goals.

Some of Nasser&#x27;s liberal and Islamist critics in Egypt, including the founding members of the New Wafd Party and writer Jamal Badawi, dismissed Nasser&#x27;s popular appeal with the Egyptian masses during his presidency as being the product of successful manipulation and demagoguery. Egyptian political scientist Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution&#x27;s shortcomings on Nasser&#x27;s concentration of power, and Egypt&#x27;s lack of democracy on Nasser&#x27;s political style and his government&#x27;s limitations on freedom of expression and political participation.
American political scientist Mark Cooper asserted that Nasser&#x27;s charisma and his direct relationship with the Egyptian people &quot;rendered intermediaries (organizations and individuals) unnecessary&quot;. He opined that Nasser&#x27;s legacy was a &quot;guarantee of instability&quot; due to Nasser&#x27;s reliance on personal power and the absence of strong political institutions under his rule. Historian Abd al-Azim Ramadan wrote that Nasser was an irrational and irresponsible leader, blaming his inclination to solitary decision-making for Egypt&#x27;s losses during the Suez War, among other events. Miles Copeland, Jr., a Central Intelligence Agency officer known for his close personal relationship with Nasser, said that the barriers between Nasser and the outside world have grown so thick that all but the information that attest to his infallibility, indispensability, and immortality has been filtered out.

Zakaria Mohieddin, who was Nasser&#x27;s vice president, said that Nasser gradually changed during his reign. He ceased consulting his colleagues and made more and more of the decisions himself. Although Nasser repeatedly said that a war with Israel will start at a time of his, or Arab, choosing, in 1967 he started a bluffing game &quot;but a successful bluff means your opponent must not know which cards you are holding. In this case Nasser&#x27;s opponent could see his hand in the mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces&quot; and Nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet. &quot;All of this was out of character...His tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes... That was the only rational explanation for his actions in 1967&quot;.

====Antisemitism====

Nasser told a German neo-Nazi newspaper in 1964 that &quot;no person, not even the most simple one, takes seriously the lie of the six million Jews that were murdered [in the Holocaust].&quot; However, he is not known to have ever again publicly called the figure of six million into question, perhaps because his advisors and East German contacts had advised him on the subject. Nasser, convinced of its authenticity, also encouraged the distribution of the antisemitic fabrication &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. He believed that the Jews greatly influenced the global financial market and that they ultimately strove for world domination. Nasser also hired former Nazi officials like Johann von Leers to distribute antisemitic propaganda. He is, however, thought to have been more moderate in that regard than contemporary political powers like Young Egypt or the Muslim Brotherhood.

=== Regional leadership ===
Through his actions and speeches, and because he was able to symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser inspired several nationalist revolutions in the Arab world. He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the Arab world, bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other Arab leaders. The extent of Nasser&#x27;s centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, in order to gain popular legitimacy from their own citizens.

To varying degrees, Nasser&#x27;s statist system of government was continued in Egypt and emulated by virtually all Arab republics, namely Algeria, Syria, Iraq, Tunisia, Yemen, Sudan, and Libya. Ahmed Ben Bella, Algeria&#x27;s first president, was a staunch Nasserist. Abdullah al-Sallal drove out the king of North Yemen in the name of Nasser&#x27;s pan-Arabism. Other coups influenced by Nasser included those that occurred in Iraq in July 1958 and Syria in 1963. Muammar Gaddafi, who overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969, considered Nasser his hero and sought to succeed him as &quot;leader of the Arabs&quot;. Also in 1969, Colonel Gaafar Nimeiry, a supporter of Nasser, took power in Sudan. The Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM) helped spread Nasser&#x27;s pan-Arabist ideas throughout the Arab world, particularly among the Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese, and in South Yemen, the Persian Gulf, and Iraq. While many regional heads of state tried to emulate Nasser, Podeh opined that the &quot;parochialism&quot; of successive Arab leaders &quot;transformed imitation [of Nasser] into parody&quot;.

=== Portrayal in film ===
In 1963, Egyptian director Youssef Chahine produced the film &quot;El Nasser Salah El Dine&quot; (&quot;Saladin The Victorious&quot;), which intentionally drew parallels between Saladin, considered a hero in the Arab world, and Nasser and his pan-Arabist policies. Nasser is played by Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Nasser 56&quot;. The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis. It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film to dramatize the role of a modern-day Arab leader. Together with the 1999 Syrian biopic &quot;Gamal Abdel Nasser&quot;, the films marked the first biographical movies about contemporary public figures produced in the Arab world. He is portrayed by Amir Boutrous in the Netflix television series &quot;The Crown&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1944, Nasser married Tahia Kazem (1920 – 25 March 1992), the daughter of a wealthy Iranian father and an Egyptian mother, both of whom had died when she was young. She had been introduced to Nasser through her brother, Abdel Hamid Kazim, a merchant friend of Nasser&#x27;s, in 1943. After their wedding, the couple moved into a house in Manshiyat al-Bakri, a suburb of Cairo, where they lived for the rest of their lives. Nasser&#x27;s entry into the officer corps in 1937 secured him relatively well-paid employment in a society where most people lived in poverty. Nasser and Tahia would sometimes discuss politics at home, but for the most part Nasser kept his career separate from his family life. He preferred to spend most of his free time with his children.

Nasser and Tahia had two daughters and three sons:

* Hoda, b. 1945.
* Mona, b. 1947.
* Khalid, (13 December 1949 – 15 September 2011). The most active politically. Said to have co-founded (with Egyptian diplomat Mahmud Nur Eddin) an organization called &quot;the Revolution of Egypt,&quot; which was accused of assassinating Israeli members of the Shin Bet stationed in Egypt in the late 1980s. Khalid took refuge in Yugoslavia and was eventually pardoned by President Hosni Mubarak.
* Abd al-Hamid, b. 1951.
* Abd al-Hakim, b. 1955. Appears regularly in Egyptian and regional media, heads the museum dedicated to the life of his father.

Although he was a proponent of secular politics, Nasser was an observant Muslim who made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1954 and 1965. He was known to be personally incorruptible, a characteristic which further enhanced his reputation among the citizens of Egypt and the Arab world. Nasser&#x27;s personal hobbies included playing chess, photography, watching American films, reading Arabic, English, and French magazines, and listening to classical music.

Nasser was a chain smoker. He maintained 18-hour workdays and rarely took time off for vacations. The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health. He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s and by the time of his death in 1970, he also had arteriosclerosis, heart disease, and high blood pressure. He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode. State media reported that Nasser&#x27;s absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.

== Writings ==
Nasser wrote the following books, published during his lifetime:

* &quot;Memoirs of the First Palestine War&quot; () (1955; Akher Sa&#x27;a)
** &quot;Memoirs of the First Palestine War&quot;, in 2, no. 2 (Win. 73): 3–32 (First English translation, 1973, pdf-file from Journal of Palestine Studies)
* &quot;Egypt&#x27;s Liberation: The Philosophy of the Revolution&quot; () (1955; Dar al-Maaref)
** &quot;Egypt&#x27;s liberation; the philosophy of the revolution&quot;, introduced by Dorothy Thompson (Washington: Public Affairs Press, 1955)
* &quot;Towards Freedom&quot; () (1959; Cairo-Arabian Company)

<text>Muhammad Hosni El Sayed Mubarak (; 4 May 1928 – 25 February 2020) was an Egyptian politician, military officer, and dictator who served as the fourth president of Egypt from 1981 to 2011.

Before he entered politics, Mubarak was a career officer in the Egyptian Air Force. He served as its commander from 1972 to 1975 and rose to the rank of air chief marshal in 1973. In 1975, he was appointed vice president by President Anwar Sadat.

After Sadat was assassinated in 1981, Mubarak assumed the presidency in a single-candidate referendum, and renewed his term through single-candidate referendums in 1987, 1993, and 1999. Under United States pressure, Mubarak held the country&#x27;s first multi-party election in 2005, which he won. In 1989, he succeeded in reinstating Egypt&#x27;s membership in the Arab League, which had been frozen since the Camp David Accords with Israel, and in returning the Arab League&#x27;s headquarters back to Cairo. He was known for his supportive stance on the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, in addition to his role in the Gulf War. Despite providing stability and reasons for economic growth, his rule was repressive. The state of emergency, which had not been lifted since the 1967 war, stifled political opposition, the security services became known for their brutality, and corruption became widespread.

Mubarak stepped down during the 2011 Egyptian revolution after 18 days of demonstrations, transferring power to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. He was later ordered to stand trial on charges of killing peaceful protesters during the revolution. These trials began on 3 August 2011, making him the first Arab leader to be tried in his own country in an ordinary court of law. On 2 June 2012, an Egyptian court sentenced Mubarak to life imprisonment. After sentencing, he was reported to have suffered a series of health crises. On 13 January 2013, Egypt&#x27;s Court of Cassation (the nation&#x27;s high court of appeal) overturned Mubarak&#x27;s sentence and ordered a retrial. On retrial, Mubarak and his sons were convicted on 9 May 2015 of corruption and given prison sentences. Mubarak was detained in a military hospital while his sons were freed on 12 October 2015 by a Cairo court. Mubarak was acquitted on 2 March 2017 by the Court of Cassation and was released on 24 March 2017.

Mubarak died in 2020, aged 91. He was honoured with a state funeral and buried at a family plot outside Cairo. Mubarak&#x27;s presidency lasted almost thirty years, making him Egypt&#x27;s longest-serving ruler since Muhammad Ali Pasha, who ruled the country for 43 years from 1805 to 1848.

==Early life and education==
Hosni Mubarak was born on 4 May 1928 in Kafr El-Meselha, Monufia Governorate, Egypt. On 2 February 1949, he left the Military Academy and joined the Air Force Academy, gaining his commission as a pilot officer on 13 March 1950 and eventually receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in aviation sciences.

==Air Force career==
Mubarak served as an Egyptian Air Force officer in various formations and units; he spent two years in a Spitfire fighter squadron. Some time in the 1950s, he returned to the Air Force Academy as an instructor, remaining there until early 1959. From February 1959 to June 1961, Mubarak undertook further training in the Soviet Union, attending a Soviet pilot training school in Moscow and another at Kant Air Base near Bishkek in the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic.

Mubarak undertook training on the Ilyushin Il-28 and Tupolev Tu-16 jet bombers. In 1964 he gained a place at the Frunze Military Academy in Moscow. On his return to Egypt, he served as a wing commander, then as a base commander; he commanded the Cairo West Air Base in October 1966 then briefly commanded the Beni Suef Air Base. In November 1967, Mubarak became the Air Force Academy&#x27;s commander when he was credited with doubling the number of Air Force pilots and navigators during the pre-October War years. Two years later, he became Chief of Staff for the Egyptian Air Force.

In 1972, Mubarak became Commander of the Air Force and Egyptian Deputy Minister of Defense. On 6 October 1973, at the breakout of the Yom Kippur War, the Egyptian Air Force launched a surprise attack on Israeli soldiers on the east bank of the Suez Canal. Egyptian pilots hit 90% of their targets, making Mubarak a national hero. The next year he was promoted to Air Chief Marshal in recognition of service during the October War of 1973 against Israel. Mubarak was credited in some publications for Egypt&#x27;s initial strong performance in the war. The Egyptian analyst Mohamed Hassanein Heikal said the Air Force played a mostly psychological role in the war, providing an inspirational sight for the Egyptian ground troops who carried out the crossing of the Suez Canal, rather than for any military necessity. However Mubarak&#x27;s influence was also disputed by Shahdan El-Shazli, the daughter of the former Egyptian military Chief of Staff Saad el-Shazly. She said Mubarak exaggerated his role in the 1973 war. In a 2011 interview with the independent Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Masry Al-Youm&quot;, El-Shazli said Mubarak altered documents to take credit from her father for the initial success of the Egyptian forces in 1973. She also said photographs pertaining to the discussions in the military command room were altered and Saad El-Shazli was erased and replaced with Mubarak. She stated she intended to take legal action.

==Vice President of Egypt==

In April 1975, President Anwar Sadat appointed Mubarak Vice President of Egypt. In this position, he took part in government consultations that dealt with the future disengagement of forces agreement with Israel. In September 1975, Mubarak went on a mission to Riyadh and Damascus to persuade the Saudi Arabian and Syrian governments to accept the disengagement agreement signed with the Israeli government (&quot;Sinai II&quot;), but was refused a meeting by the Syrian president Hafez al-Assad. During his meetings with the Saudi government, Mubarak developed a friendship with the nation&#x27;s powerful Crown Prince Fahd, whom Sadat had refused to meet or contact and who was now seen as a major player who could help mend the failing relationship between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Mubarak also developed friendships with several other important Arab leaders, including Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud, Oman&#x27;s Sultan Qaboos, Morocco&#x27;s King Hassan II, and Sudan&#x27;s President Jaafar Nimeiry.

Sadat also sent Mubarak to numerous meetings with foreign leaders outside the Arab world. Mubarak&#x27;s political significance as Vice President can be seen from a conversation held on 23 June 1975 between Foreign Minister Fahmy and US Ambassador Hermann Eilts. Fahmy told Eilts that &quot;Mubarak is, for the time being at least, likely to be a regular participant in all sensitive meetings&quot; and he advised the ambassador not to antagonize Mubarak because he was Sadat&#x27;s personal choice. Though supportive of Sadat&#x27;s earlier efforts made to bring the Sinai Peninsula back into Egyptian control, Mubarak agreed with the views of various Arab leaders and opposed the Camp David Accords for failing to address other issues relating to the Arab–Israeli conflict. Sadat even transferred his decision-making authority to Mubarak temporarily at times he went on vacations.

==President of Egypt==
Mubarak was injured during the assassination of President Sadat in October 1981 by soldiers led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli. Following Sadat&#x27;s death, Mubarak became the fourth president of Egypt.

===Egypt&#x27;s return to the Arab League===
Until Libya&#x27;s suspension from the Arab League at the beginning of the Libyan Civil War, Egypt was the only state in the history of the organization to have had its membership suspended, because of President Sadat&#x27;s peace treaty with Israel. In June 1982, Mubarak met King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, which marked a beginning of an Egyptian-Saudi rapprochement. Since Egypt is the most populous Arab country and Saudi Arabia the richest, the Saudi–Egyptian axis was a powerful force in the Arab world. At an Arab League summit later in 1982 in Fez, Saudi Arabia put forward an Egyptian peace plan where in exchange for Israel resolving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict by allowing a Palestinian state, the entire Arab world would make peace with Israel.

The Islamic Republic of Iran had, from 1979 onward, been making the claim to be the leader of the Islamic world, and in particular Ayatollah Khomeini had called for the overthrow of the governments of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Arab states along the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, calling these states illegitimate. The claim of the Ayatollah Khomeini to be the rightful leader of the Islamic world and his attempts to export the Iranian revolution by working to overthrow governments that Khomeini deemed un-Islamic caused profound alarm and fear in the governments that were targeted like Iraq and Saudi Arabia. In the face of the Iranian challenge, the other Arab states looked towards Egypt as an ally. For King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the other leaders of the Arab Gulf states, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict faded into the background and the main concern was resisting Iranian pretensions to be the leader of the Islamic world, meaning that Egypt could not be ignored.

During the Iran–Iraq War from 1980 to 1988, Egypt supported Iraq militarily and economically with one million Egyptians working in Iraq to take the place of Iraqi men serving on the front-line. In December 1983, Mubarak welcomed Yasser Arafat of the PLO to a summit in Cairo, marking a rapprochement with the PLO, and from that time, Egypt became the PLO&#x27;s main ally. In 1985, the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; hijacking caused a major crisis in relations when the U.S Air Force forced an EgyptAir plane carrying the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; hijackers to Tunisia to land in Italy; otherwise the plane would have been shot down. Mubarak stated in a press conference on 12 October 1985: &quot;I am very wounded. Now there is coolness and strain as a result of this incident.&quot; Egypt had been ostracized by the other Arab states for signing the Camp David Accords in 1979, but Egypt&#x27;s weight within the Arab world had led to Egypt regaining its &quot;central place in the Arab world&quot; by 1989. In 1989, Egypt was re-admitted as a full member to the Arab League and the League&#x27;s headquarters were moved to their original location in Cairo.

=== Governing style ===
Throughout the 1980s, Mubarak increased the production of affordable housing, clothing, furniture, and medicine. The state remained large under Mubarak employing 8 million people out of a population of 75 million.

By the time he became president, Mubarak was one of a few Egyptian officials who refused to visit Israel and vowed to take a less enthusiastic approach to normalizing relations with the Israeli government. Under Mubarak, Israeli journalists often wrote about the &quot;cold peace&quot; with Egypt, observing Israeli–Egyptian relations were frosty at best. Mubarak was quick to deny that his policies would result in difficulties for Egyptian–Israeli dealings in the future.

The Israeli historian Major Efraim Karsh wrote in 2006 that in Egypt &quot;...numberless articles, scholarly writings, books, cartoons, public statements, and radio and television programs, Jews are painted in the blackest terms imaginable&quot;. Karsh accused Mubarak of being personally antisemitic, writing he &quot;evidently shared the premises&quot; of his propaganda.

Egypt&#x27;s heavy dependence on US aid and its hopes for US pressure on Israel for a Palestinian settlement continued under Mubarak.

Mubarak took significant steps to improve relations with the then-Soviet Union. In 1984, he reestablished diplomatic ties that had been severed by his predecessor, Anwar Sadat, in 1981. This move marked a shift from the previous estrangement and aimed to diversify Egypt&#x27;s international partnerships.

In his early years in power, Mubarak expanded the Egyptian State Security Investigations Service (&quot;Mabahith Amn ad-Dawla&quot;) and the Central Security Forces (anti-riot and containment forces). According to Tarek Osman, the experience of seeing his predecessor assassinated &quot;right in front of him&quot; and his lengthy military careerwhich was longer than those of Nasser or Sadatmay have instilled in him more focus and absorption with security than seemed the case with the latter heads of state. Mubarak sought advice and confidence not in leading ministers, senior advisers or leading intellectuals, but from his security chiefs—&quot;interior ministers, army commanders, and the heads of the ultra-influential intelligence services.&quot;

Because of his positions against Islamic fundamentalism and his diplomacy towards Israel, Mubarak was the target of repeated assassination attempts. According to the BBC, Mubarak survived six attempts on his life. In June 1995, there was an alleged assassination attempt involving noxious gases and Egyptian Islamic Jihad while Mubarak was in Ethiopia for a conference of the Organization of African Unity. He was also reportedly injured by a knife-wielding assailant in Port Said in September 1999.

=== Repression and torture ===
During Hosni Mubarak&#x27;s presidency, Egypt was marked by widespread human rights abuses, including arbitrary detention and systematic torture. The government maintained a continuous state of emergency, granting security forces extensive powers to arrest and detain individuals without due process. Reports from human rights organizations highlight the pervasive use of torture in police stations and detention centers. Detainees were subjected to severe beatings, electric shocks, suspension by the wrists and ankles, and sexual violence. These practices were not isolated incidents but part of a systematic approach to suppress dissent and control the population. The lack of accountability for security forces further entrenched a culture of impunity, allowing such violations to persist throughout Mubarak&#x27;s tenure.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===

During his presidency, Mubarak upheld the U.S.-brokered Camp David Accords treaty signed between Egypt and Israel in 1978. Mubarak on occasion also hosted meetings relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and made a number of attempts to serve as a broker between them. Mubarak was concerned that Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson did not trust him on the issue and considered meeting him in New York.

In October 2000, Mubarak hosted an emergency summit meeting at Sharm el-Sheikh to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In attendance were: U.S. President Bill Clinton, P.L.O. Chairman Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, King Abdullah of Jordan, NATO Sec. General Javier Solana, and U.N. Sec. General Kofi Annan. Mubarak was involved in the Arab League, supporting Arab efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the region. At the Beirut Summit on 28 March 2002, the league adopted the Arab Peace Initiative, a Saudi-inspired plan to end the Arab–Israeli conflict. In 2006, Mubarak condemned the Israeli military attack in Lebanon, but also indirectly criticised Hezbollah for harming Arab interests.

In June 2007, Mubarak held a summit meeting at Sharm el-Sheik with King Abdullah II of Jordan, President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. On 19 June 2008, the Egypt-brokered pause in hostilities between Israel and Hamas went into effect. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, neither side fully respected the terms of the ceasefire.

The agreement required Hamas to end rocket attacks on Israel and to enforce the ceasefire throughout Gaza. In exchange, Hamas expected the blockade to end, commerce in Gaza to resume, and truck shipments to be restored to 2005 levels. Israel tied an easing of the blockade to a reduction in rocket fire and gradually re-opened supply lines and permitted around 90 daily truck shipments to enter Gaza. Hamas criticized Israel for its continued blockade while Israel accused Hamas of continued weapons smuggling via tunnels to Egypt and pointed to continued rocket attacks. In 2009, Mubarak&#x27;s government banned the Cairo Anti-war Conference, which had criticised his lack of action against Israel.

===Gulf War of 1991===
Egypt was a member of the allied coalition during the 1991 Gulf War; Egyptian infantry were some of the first to land in Saudi Arabia to remove Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Egypt&#x27;s participation in the war solidified its central role in the Arab World and brought financial benefits for the Egyptian government. Reports of sums of up to worth of debt forgiveness were published in the news media. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;: The programme worked like a charm: a textbook case, says the [International Monetary Fund]. In fact, luck was on Hosni Mubarak&#x27;s side; when the US was hunting for a military alliance to force Iraq out of Kuwait, Egypt&#x27;s president joined without hesitation. After the war, his reward was that America, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and Europe forgave Egypt around $20 billion of debt.

===Stance on the 2003 invasion of Iraq===
Mubarak spoke out against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, arguing that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict should have been resolved first. He also said the war would cause &quot;100 Bin Ladens&quot;. However, as president he did not support an immediate US withdrawal from Iraq because he believed it would probably lead to chaos.

===2005 elections===

President Mubarak was re-elected by majority votes in a referendum for successive terms on four occasions in 1987, 1993, and 1999. Each time, Mubarak secured his position by having himself nominated by Parliament then confirmed without opposition in a referendum.

The September 2005 ballot was a multiple-candidate election rather than a referendum, but the electoral institutions and security apparatus remain under the control of the President. On 28 July 2005, Mubarak announced his candidacy. The election was scheduled for 7 September 2005; according to civil organizations that observed the election it was marred by mass rigging activities. In a move widely seen as political persecution, Ayman Nour, a dissident and candidate for the El-Ghad Party (&quot;Tomorrow Party&quot;) was convicted of forgery and sentenced to five years&#x27; hard labor on 24 December 2005.

===Widespread corruption===
While in office, political corruption in the Mubarak administration&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior rose dramatically. Political figures and young activists were imprisoned without trial. Illegal, undocumented, hidden detention facilities were established, and universities, mosques, and newspaper staff were rejected because of their political views.

In 2005 Freedom House, a non-governmental organization that conducts research into democracy, reported that the Egyptian government under Mubarak expanded bureaucratic regulations, registration requirements, and other controls that often feed corruption. Freedom House said, &quot;corruption remained a significant problem under Mubarak, who promised to do much, but in fact never did anything significant to tackle it effectively&quot;.

In 2010, Transparency International&#x27;s Corruption Perceptions Index report assessed Egypt with a CPI score of 3.1, based on perceptions of the degree of corruption from business people and country analysts, with 10 being very clean and 0 being highly corrupt. Egypt ranked 98th out of the 178 countries included in the report.

===Wealth and allegations of personal corruption===
In February 2011, ABC News reported that experts believed the personal wealth of Mubarak and his family was between and from military contracts made during his time as an air force officer. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Mubarak and his family might be worth up to garnered from corruption, bribes and legitimate business activities. The money was said to be spread out in various bank accounts, including some in Switzerland and the UK, and invested in foreign property. The newspaper said some of the information about the family&#x27;s wealth might be ten years old. According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, these allegations are poorly substantiated and lack credibility.

On 12 February 2011, the government of Switzerland announced it was freezing the Swiss bank accounts of Mubarak and his family. On 20February 2011, the Egyptian Prosecutor General ordered the freezing of Mubarak&#x27;s assets and those of his wife Suzanne, his sons Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, and his daughters-in-law Heidi Rasekh and Khadiga Gamal. The Prosecutor General also ordered the Egyptian foreign minister to communicate this to other countries where Mubarak and his family could have assets. This order came two days after Egyptian newspapers reported that Mubarak filed his financial statement. Egyptian regulations mandate government officials submit a financial statement listing their assets and sources of income while performing government work. On 21February 2011, the Egyptian Military Council, which was temporarily given the presidential authorities following the 25January 2011 revolution, said it had no objection to a trial of Mubarak on charges of corruption.

On 23February 2011, the Egyptian newspaper &quot;Eldostor&quot; reported that a &quot;knowledgeable source&quot; described the order of the Prosecutor General to freeze Mubarak&#x27;s assets and the threats of a legal action as nothing but a signal for Mubarak to leave Egypt after a number of attempts were made to encourage him to leave willingly. In February 2011, Voice of America reported that Egypt&#x27;s top prosecutor had ordered a travel ban and an asset freeze for Mubarak and his family as he considered further action. On 21 May 2014 a Cairo court convicted Mubarak and his sons of embezzling the equivalent of of state funds which were allocated for renovation and maintenance of presidential palaces but were instead diverted to upgrade private family homes. The court ordered the repayment of , fined the trio , and sentenced Mubarak to three years in prison and each of his sons to four years.

===Presidential succession===

The National Democratic Party continued to state that Hosni Mubarak was to be the party&#x27;s only candidate in the 2011 presidential election. Mubarak said on 1 February 2011 that he had no intention of standing in the 2011 presidential election. When this declaration failed to ease the protests, Mubarak&#x27;s vice president stated that Gamal Mubarak would not run for president. With the escalation of the demonstration and the fall of Mubarak, Hamdy El-Sayed, a former influential figure in the National Democratic Party, said Gamal Mubarak intended to usurp the presidency, assisted by then Interior Minister, Habib El-Adly.

==Revolution and overthrow==

Protests against Mubarak and his regime erupted in Cairo and other Egyptian cities in January 2011. On 1 February, Mubarak announced he would not contest the presidential election due in September. He also promised constitutional reform. This did not satisfy most protesters, who expected Mubarak to depart immediately. The demonstrations continued and on 2 February, violent clashes occurred between pro-Mubarak and anti-Mubarak protesters.

On 10 February, contrary to rumours, Mubarak said he would not resign until the September election, though he would be delegating responsibilities to Vice President Omar Suleiman. The next day, Suleiman announced that Mubarak had resigned. The announcement sparked cheers, flag-waving, and celebrations from protesters in Egypt. Discussions about the nation&#x27;s future direction began. It had been suggested that Egypt be put in the hands of a caretaker government.

===Protests===
On 25 January 2011, protests against Mubarak and his government erupted in Cairo and around Egypt calling for Mubarak&#x27;s resignation. Mubarak stated in a speech that he would not leave, and would die on Egyptian soil. Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei paid no attention to Mubarak&#x27;s remarks and labeled it as a trick designed to help Mubarak to stay in power. In a state televised broadcast on 1 February 2011, Mubarak announced that he would not seek re-election in September but would like to finish his current term and promised constitutional reform. This compromise was not acceptable for the protestors and violent demonstrations occurred in front of the Presidential Palace. On 11 February, then Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak had resigned and that power would be turned over to the Egyptian military.

Two and a half hours after Mubarak&#x27;s resignation, an Egyptian military member came on air and thanked Mubarak for &quot;putting the interests of the country first.&quot; The statement, which said &quot;The Supreme Council is currently studying the situation,&quot; did not state what the council would do next.

==Post-overthrow life==
Mubarak made no media appearances after his overthrow. Except for his family and a close circle of aides, he reportedly refused to talk to anyoneeven his supporters. His health was speculated to be rapidly deteriorating; some reports said he was in a coma. Most sources said he was no longer interested in performing any duties and wanted to &quot;die in Sharm El-Sheikh&quot;.

On 28 February 2011, the General Prosecutor of Egypt issued an order prohibiting Mubarak and his family from leaving Egypt. It was reported that Mubarak was in contact with his lawyer in case of possible criminal charges against him. As a result, Mubarak and his family were placed under house arrest at a presidential palace in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. On 13 April 2011, a prosecutor originally appointed by Mubarak ordered the former president and both his sons to be detained for 15 days of questioning about allegations of corruption and abuse of power amid growing suspicion that the Egyptian military was more aligned with the Mubaraks than with the revolution. Gamal and Alaa were jailed in Tora Prison; state television reported that Mubarak was in police custody in a hospital near his residence following a heart attack. Former Israeli Cabinet minister Benjamin Ben Eliezer told Israeli Radio that he had offered Mubarak refuge in the southern Israeli city of Eilat.

On 11 May 2013, he told &quot;El-Watan&quot; in his first media appearance since his resignation said, &quot;History will judge and I am still certain that the coming generations will view me fairly.&quot; He added that President Mohammed Morsi faced a tough time and that it was too early to judge him.

===Trial===

On 24 May 2011, Mubarak was ordered to stand trial on charges of premeditated murder of peaceful protesters during the revolution and, if convicted, could face the death penalty. The decision to try Mubarak was made days before a scheduled protest in Tahrir Square. The full list of charges released by the public prosecutor was &quot;intentional murder, attempted killing of some demonstrators ... misuse of influence, deliberately wasting public funds and unlawfully making private financial gains and profits&quot;.

On 28 May, a Cairo administrative court found Mubarak guilty of damaging the national economy during the protests by shutting down the Internet and telephone services. He was fined LE200 millionabout which the court ordered he must pay from his personal assets. This was the first court ruling against Mubarak, who would next have to answer to the murder charges.

The trial of Hosni Mubarak, his sons Ala&#x27;a and Gamal, former interior minister Habib el-Adly and six former top police officials began on 3 August 2011 at a temporary criminal court at the Police Academy in north Cairo. They were charged with corruption and the premeditated killing of peaceful protesters during the mass movement to oust the Mubarak government, the latter of which carries the death penalty. The trial was broadcast on Egyptian television; Mubarak made an unexpected appearancehis first since his resignation. He was taken into the court on a hospital bed and held in a cage for the session. Upon hearing the charges against him, Mubarak pleaded not guilty. Judge Ahmed Refaat adjourned the court, ruling that Mubarak be transferred under continued arrest to the military hospital on the outskirts of Cairo. The second court session scheduled for 15 August. On 15 August, the resumed trial lasted three hours. At the end of the session, Rifaat announced that the third session would take place on 5 September and that the remainder of the proceedings would be off-limits to television cameras.

The trial resumed in December 2011 and lasted until January 2012. The defense strategy was that Mubarak never actually resigned, was still president, and thus had immunity. On 2 June 2012, Mubarak was found guilty of not halting the killing of protesters by the Egyptian security forces; he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The court found Mubarak not guilty of ordering the crackdown on Egyptian protesters. All other charges against Mubarak, including profiteering and economic fraud, were dismissed. Mubarak&#x27;s sons, Habib el-Adly, and six senior police officials were all acquitted for their roles in the killing of demonstrators because of a lack of evidence. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the relatives of those killed by Mubarak&#x27;s forces were angered by the verdict. Thousands of demonstrators protested the verdict in Tahrir Square, Arbein Square and Al-Qaed Ibrahim Square.

In January 2013, an appeals court overturned Mubarak&#x27;s life sentence and ordered a retrial. He remained in custody and returned to court on 11 May 2013 for a retrial on charges of complicity in the murder of protesters. On 21 August 2013, a Cairo court ordered his release. Judicial sources confirmed that the court had upheld a petition from Mubarak&#x27;s longtime lawyer that called for his release. A day later, interim prime minister Hazem El Beblawi ordered that Mubarak be put under house arrest.

On 21 May 2014, while awaiting retrial, Mubarak and his sons were convicted on charges of embezzlement; Mubarak was sentenced to three years in prison, while his sons received four-year sentences. The three were fined the equivalent of , and were ordered to repay .

In November 2014, conspiracy to kill charges were dismissed by the Cairo Criminal Court on a technicality. The court also cleared Mubarak of corruption charges. On 13 January 2015, Egypt&#x27;s Court of Cassation overturned Mubarak&#x27;s and his sons&#x27; embezzlement charges, the last remaining conviction against him, and ordered a retrial. A retrial on the corruption charges led to a conviction and sentencing to three years in prison in May 2015 for Mubarak, with four-year terms for his sons, Gamal and Alaa. It was not immediately clear whether the sentence would take into account time already served—Mubarak and his sons had already spent more than three years in prison, so potentially would not have to serve any additional time. Supporters of Mubarak jeered the decision when it was announced in a Cairo courtroom on 9 May. The sentence also included a 125 million Egyptian pound (US$16.3 million) fine, and required the return of 21 million embezzled Egyptian pounds (US$2.7 million). These amounts were previously paid after the first trial.

===Support for Sisi===
Though mostly out of the public eye, Mubarak granted a rare interview in February 2014 with Kuwaiti journalist Fajer Al-Saeed, expressing support for then-Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as the next President of Egypt, recognizing that Sisi was working to restore the confidence of the Egyptian people. &quot;The people want Sisi, and the people&#x27;s will shall prevail,&quot; Mubarak noted. Mubarak also expressed great admiration and gratitude towards the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates and his children, for their continuous support of Egypt and its people. However, Mubarak expressed his dislike of opposition politician Hamdeen Sabbahi, a Nasserist following the policies of Gamal Abdel Nasser.

===Health problems===
In July 2010, the media said Egypt was about to undergo dramatic change because Mubarak was thought to have cancer and because of the scheduled 2011 presidential election. Intelligence sources said he had esophageal cancer, stomach or pancreatic cancer; this was denied by Egyptian authorities. Speculation about his ill health increased after his resignation from the presidency. According to Egyptian media, Mubarak&#x27;s condition worsened after he went into exile in Sharm el-Sheikh. He was reportedly depressed, refused to take medications, and was slipping into and out of unconsciousness. According to the sourcean unnamed Egyptian security official&quot;Mubarak wants to be left alone and die in his homeland&quot;. The source denied that Mubarak was writing his memoirs, stating that he was almost completely unconscious. After his resignation, Egypt&#x27;s ambassador to the United States Sameh Shoukry reported that his personal sources said Mubarak &quot;is possibly in somewhat of bad health&quot;, while several Egyptian and Saudi Arabian newspapers reported that Mubarak was in a coma and close to death. On 12 April 2011, it was reported that he had been hospitalized after suffering a heart attack during questioning over possible corruption charges.

In June 2011, Mubarak&#x27;s lawyer Farid el-Deeb said his client &quot;has stomach cancer, and the cancer is growing&quot;. Mubarak had undergone surgery for the condition in Germany in 2010 and also suffered from circulatory problems with an irregular heart beat. On 13 July 2011, unconfirmed reports stated that Mubarak had slipped into a coma at his residence after giving his final speech, and on 17 July, el-Deeb confirmed the reports. On 26 July 2011, Mubarak was reported to be depressed and refusing solid food while in hospital being treated for a heart condition and in custody awaiting trial.

On 2 June 2012, Mubarak was reported as have suffered a health crisis while being transported to prison after his conviction on the charges of complicity in the killing of protestors. Some sources reported he had had a heart attack. Further reports stated that Mubarak&#x27;s health continued to decline; some said he had to be treated with a defibrillator. On 20 June 2012, as Mubarak&#x27;s condition continued to decline, state-run media erroneously reported that the former president had been declared &quot;clinically dead&quot;, causing widespread confusion. Officials later clarified that Mubarak was in a critical condition.

On 27 December 2012, Mubarak was taken from Tora Prison to the Cairo military hospital after falling and breaking a rib. He was released from prison in August 2013.

On 19 June 2014, Mubarak slipped in the bathroom at the military hospital in Cairo where he was being held and broke his left leg, also fracturing his left thighbone, requiring surgery. Mubarak was serving a three-year sentence for corruption, and also awaiting retrial regarding the killing of protesters during his regime. At one time, his release was ordered. However, Mubarak had remained at the military hospital since January 2014 due to his ongoing health issues.

===Acquittal===
On 2 March 2017, the Court of Cassation, Egypt&#x27;s top appeals court, acquitted Mubarak of conspiring in the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising. He was subsequently released on 24 March 2017.

== Death ==
Hosni Mubarak died on 25 February 2020, in a Cairo military hospital, at the age of 91. A full-honour state funeral was held for him at the Tantawi Mosque in eastern Cairo, and he was later buried in a cemetery in Heliopolis. Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi participated at the funeral and extended his condolences to Mubarak&#x27;s widow, Suzanne, and his sons Alaa and Gamal; three days of national mourning were subsequently proclaimed.

Following his death, President El-Sisi praised Mubarak for his role in the Yom Kippur War but remained silent over his role as president. The government-controlled newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; eulogized Mubarak for his military and political career.

==Personal life==
Hosni Mubarak was married to Suzanne Thabet, with whom he had two sons: Alaa and Gamal. Both sons served four years in Egyptian jail for corruption and were released in 2015. Through his son Alaa, Mubarak has two grandsons, Mohammed and Omar; and through his son Gamal, he has a granddaughter Farida. Mohammed died in 2009 from a cerebral hemorrhage.

In April 2016, Alaa Mubarak was named in the Panama Papers as someone with financial interests that intersect with that of Mossack Fonseca, the firm implicated in that scandal.

<doc id="51885" wikidata="Q190656" url="?curid=51885" title="Multiculturalism">
<text>Multiculturalism is the coexistence of multiple cultures. The word is used in sociology, in political philosophy, and colloquially. In sociology and everyday usage, it is usually a synonym for &quot;ethnic&quot; or cultural pluralism in which various ethnic and cultural groups exist in a single society. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist or a single country. Groups associated with an indigenous, aboriginal or ethnic group and settler-descended ethnic groups are often the focus.

In reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally controlled immigration) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation&#x27;s communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. French Canada and English Canada). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal migration to and from different jurisdictions around the world.

In reference to political science, &quot;multiculturalism&quot; can be defined as a state&#x27;s capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural plurality within its sovereign borders. Multiculturalism as a political philosophy involves ideologies and policies which vary widely. It has been described as a &quot;salad bowl&quot; and as a &quot;cultural mosaic&quot;, in contrast to a &quot;melting pot&quot;.

==Prevalence==
===History===
States that embody multicultural ideals have arguably existed since ancient times. The Achaemenid Empire founded by Cyrus the Great followed a policy of incorporating and tolerating various cultures.
A historical example of multiculturalism was the Habsburg monarchy, which had broken up in 1918 and under whose roof many different ethnic, linguistic and religious groups lived together. The Habsburg rule was mired in controversy, including events such as the mass murder committed against Székelys by the Habsburg army in 1764 and the destruction of Romanian Orthodox Churches and Monasteries in Transylvania by Adolf Nikolaus von Buccow. Both events had happened during the rule of Maria Theresa. Today&#x27;s topical issues such as social and cultural differentiation, multilingualism, competing identity offers or multiple cultural identities have already shaped the scientific theories of many thinkers of this multi-ethnic empire. After the First World War, ethnic minorities were disadvantaged, forced to emigrate or even murdered in most regions in the area of the former Habsburg monarchy due to the prevailing nationalism at the time. In many areas, these ethnic mosaics no longer exist today. The ethnic mix of that time can only be experienced in a few areas, such as in the former Habsburg port city of Trieste.

In the political philosophy of multiculturalism, ideas are focused on the ways in which societies are either believed to or should, respond to cultural and Christian differences. It is often associated with &quot;identity politics&quot;, &quot;the politics of difference&quot;, and &quot;the politics of recognition&quot;. It is also a matter of economic interests and political power. In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as African Americans and the LGBT community, with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, indigenous peoples and even people with disabilities. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.

Most debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group&#x27;s culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a melting pot or non-multicultural societies.

The term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western nation-states, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.
Multiculturalism has been official policy in several Western nations since the 1970s, for reasons that varied from country to country, including the fact that many of the great cities of the Western world are increasingly made of a mosaic of cultures.

The Canadian government has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration. The Canadian Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism is often referred to as the origins of modern political awareness of multiculturalism. Canada has provided provisions to the French speaking majority of Quebec, whereby they function as an autonomous community with special rights to govern the members of their community, as well as establish French as one of the official languages. In the Western English-speaking countries, multiculturalism as an official national policy started in Canada in 1971, followed by Australia in 1973 where it is maintained today. It was quickly adopted as official policy by most member-states of the European Union. Recently, right-of-center governments in several European states – notably the Netherlands and Denmark – have reversed the national policy and returned to an official monoculturalism. A similar reversal is the subject of debate in the United Kingdom, among others, due to evidence of incipient segregation and anxieties over &quot;home-grown&quot; terrorism. Several heads-of-state or heads-of-government have expressed doubts about the success of multicultural policies: The United Kingdom&#x27;s ex-Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Australia&#x27;s ex-prime minister John Howard, Spanish ex-prime minister José María Aznar and French ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy have voiced concerns about the effectiveness of their multicultural policies for integrating immigrants.

Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse and are &#x27;multicultural&#x27; in a descriptive sense. In some, ethnic communalism is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multiculturalist policies in the Western world, but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or mono-ethnic nation-building – for instance in the Malaysian government&#x27;s attempt to create a &#x27;Malaysian race&#x27; by 2020.

===Support===
Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues. They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.

Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the &quot;human rights revolution&quot;, in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and ethnic cleansing became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the Holocaust; with the collapse of the European colonial system, as colonized nations in Africa and Asia successfully fought for their independence and pointed out the discriminatory underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, which criticized ideals of assimilation that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic ethnic studies programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms. As this history shows, multiculturalism in Western countries was seen to combat racism, to protect minority communities of all types, and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the liberalism that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the Age of Enlightenment. The contact hypothesis in sociology is a well-documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one&#x27;s own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility.

Will Kymlicka argues for &quot;group differentiated rights&quot;, that help both religious and cultural minorities operate within the larger state as a whole, without impinging on the rights of the larger society. He bases this on his opinion that human rights fall short in protecting the rights of minorities, as the state has no stake in protecting the minorities.

C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it &quot;uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten. By closing gaps, by raising consciousness about the past, multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a postmodern era that fragments human life and thought.&quot;

Tariq Modood argues that in the early years of the 21st century, multiculturalism &quot;is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less&quot;, since it is &quot;the form of integration&quot; that (1) best fits the ideal of egalitarianism, (2) has &quot;the best chance of succeeding&quot; in the &quot;post-9/11, post 7/7&quot; world, and (3) has remained &quot;moderate [and] pragmatic&quot;.

Bhikhu Parekh counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities &quot;demanding special rights&quot; and to see these as promoting a &quot;thinly veiled racis[m]&quot;. Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact &quot;not about minorities&quot; but &quot;is about the proper terms of the relationship between different cultural communities&quot;, which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., &quot;the principles of justice&quot; must not come from only one of the cultures but must come &quot;through an open and equal dialogue between them.&quot;

Balibar characterizes criticisms of multiculturalism as &quot;differentialist racism&quot;, which he describes as a covert form of racism that does not purport ethnic superiority as much as it asserts stereotypes of perceived &quot;incompatibility of life-styles and traditions&quot;.

While there is research that suggests that ethnic diversity increases chances of war, lower public goods provision and decreases democratization, there is also research that shows that ethnic diversity in itself is not detrimental to peace, public goods provision or democracy. Rather, it was found that promoting diversity actually helps in advancing disadvantaged students. A 2018 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; cast doubts on findings that ethnoracial homogeneity led to greater public goods provision. A 2015 study in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot; challenged past research showing that racial diversity adversely affected trust.

According to migration researcher Hein de Haas, research shows that there is no systematic relationship between levels of immigration or ethnic diversity and social cohesion or trust. Studies show that factors such as economic inequality and trust in government are much more important for social cohesion than diversity. In countries and regions where income inequality is low and where people trust their government, social cohesion remains strong even with high levels of diversity. Canada and Australia, for example, are countries with high levels of immigration and diversity, but also with stable and well-functioning societies. On the other hand, hate speech toward minority groups by politicians can reduce social cohesion. So diversity as such does not undermine social cohesion, hate speech by politicians does.

===Criticism===

Critics of multiculturalism often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co-existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another, and yet remain distinct, is sustainable, paradoxical, or even desirable. It is argued that nation states, who would previously have been synonymous with a distinctive cultural identity of their own, lose out to enforced multiculturalism and that this ultimately erodes the host nations&#x27; distinct culture.

Sarah Song views cultures as historically shaped entities by its members, and that they lack boundaries due to globalization, thereby making them stronger than others might assume. She goes on to argue against the notion of special rights as she feels cultures are mutually constructive, and are shaped by the dominant culture. Brian Barry advocates a difference-blind approach to culture in the political realm and he rejects group-based rights as antithetical to the universalist liberal project, which he views as based on the individual.

Susan Moller Okin, a feminist professor of political philosophy, argued in 1999, in &quot;Is multiculturalism bad for women?&quot;, that the principle that all cultures are equal means that the equal rights of women in particular are sometimes severely violated.

Harvard professor of political science Robert D. Putnam conducted a nearly decade-long study on how multiculturalism affects social trust. He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust. People in diverse communities &quot;don&#x27;t trust the local mayor, they don&#x27;t trust the local paper, they don&#x27;t trust other people and they don&#x27;t trust institutions,&quot; writes Putnam. In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that, &quot;[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it&#x27;s not just that we don&#x27;t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don&#x27;t trust people who do not look like us&quot;. Putnam has also stated, however, that &quot;this allergy to diversity tends to diminish and to go away... I think in the long run we&#x27;ll all be better.&quot; Putnam denied allegations he was arguing against diversity in society and contended that his paper had been &quot;twisted&quot; to make a case against race-conscious admissions to universities. He asserted that his &quot;extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society.&quot;

Ethnologist Frank Salter writes:
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism. For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government&#x27;s share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens. Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure. Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies . A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities.
Dick Lamm, former three-term Democratic governor of the US state of Colorado, argued that &quot;diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other—that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent.&quot;

The American classicist Victor Davis Hanson used the perceived differences in &quot;rationality&quot; between Moctezuma and Cortés to argue that Western culture was superior to every culture in the entire world, which thus led him to reject multiculturalism as a false doctrine that placed all cultures on an equal footing.

In New Zealand (Aotearoa), which is officially bi-cultural, multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to the Māori as an attempt by the New Zealand Government to undermine Māori demands for self-determination and encourage assimilation.

Far-right sympathisers have been shown to increasingly take part in a multitude of online discursive efforts directed against global brands&#x27; multicultural advertisements.

Racial and ethnic labels can have a significant impact: nonminorities primed to think of themselves as White (versus European American) were subsequently less in favor of multiculturalism and were more racially prejudiced. This was due to decreases in identification with ethnic minorities.

== Americas ==
===Argentina===

Though not called &quot;Multiculturalism&quot; as such, the preamble of Argentina&#x27;s constitution explicitly promotes immigration, and recognizes the individual&#x27;s multiple citizenship from other countries. Though 97% of Argentina&#x27;s population self-identify as of European descent and mestizo to this day a high level of multiculturalism remains a feature of Argentina&#x27;s culture, allowing foreign festivals and holidays (e.g. Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day), supporting all kinds of art or cultural expressions from ethnic groups, as well as their diffusion through an important multicultural presence in the media.
In Argentina there are recognized regional languages Guaraní in Corrientes, Quechua in Santiago del Estero, Qom, Mocoví, and Wichí in Chaco.
According to the National Institute for Indigenous Affairs published on its website, there are 1,779 registered indigenous communities in Argentina, belonging to 39 indigenous peoples.

=== Bolivia ===
Bolivia is a diverse country made up of 36 different types of indigenous groups. Over 62% of Bolivia&#x27;s population falls into these different indigenous groups, making it the most indigenous country in Latin America. Out of the indigenous groups the Aymara and the Quechua are the largest. The latter 30% of the population is a part of the mestizo, which are a people mixed with European and indigenous ancestry. Bolivia&#x27;s political administrations have endorsed multicultural politics and in 2009 Bolivia&#x27;s Constitution was inscribed with multicultural principles. The Constitution of Bolivia recognizes 36 official languages besides Spanish, each language has its own culture and indigenous group. Bolivian culture is celebrated across the country and has heavy influences from the Aymara, the Quechua, the Spanish, and other popular cultures from around Latin America.

=== Brazil ===
Brazil has been known to acclaim multiculturalism and has undergone many changes regarding this in the past few decades. Brazil is a controversial country when it comes to defining a multicultural country. There are two views: the Harvard Institute of Economic Research points to the fact that Brazil has a large mixed-race population, while researcher Erkan Gören of the University of Oldenburg notes that virtually all Brazilians speaks Portuguese.

Cities such as São Paulo are home to migrants from Japan, Italy, Lebanon and Portugal. There is a multicultural presence in this city, and this is prevalent throughout Brazil. Furthermore, Brazil is a country that has made great strides to embrace migrant cultures. There has been increased awareness of anti-blackness and active efforts to combat racism. However, there is still a lack of school engagement in these matters.

===Canada===

Canadian society is often depicted as being &quot;very progressive, diverse, and multicultural,&quot; or a just society that formally acknowledges several different cultures and beliefs. Multiculturalism, however, is a misnomer often misidentified as a societal ideal with its associated natural moral sensitivity, whereas it functions as a political instrument for diversity management under official policy. Multiculturalism was adopted as the official policy of the Canadian government during the premiership of Pierre Elliott Trudeau in the 1970s and 1980s, influenced by factors such as the militant politics of Québécois nationalism, rising Indigenous discontent over the assimilationist policies outlined in the 1969 White Paper, the threat of American cultural annexation, the need to secure ethnic votes in immigrant-rich urban centers, and the appeasement of other European ethnic groups. 

Multiculturalism is reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act and section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canadian multiculturalism is often seen as cherishing immigrant ways of life from outside the country, and as such, it is looked upon with admiration resulting in dismissing of most critics of the concept. The Broadcasting Act of 1991 asserts the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the diversity of cultures in the country. This conceptual transition of multiculturalism is also reflected in Canada&#x27;s official discourse, where attitudes about “multiculturalism” have shifted to focus on “diversity,” driven by increasing immigration rates. It now emphasizes Canada&#x27;s growing multicultural makeup and the variety of ethnic and racial groups within the country. Multiculturalism in Canada is often globally recognized as one of the country&#x27;s significant accomplishments in diversity management, and a key distinguishing element of Canadian national identity.

In a 2002 interview with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Karīm al-Hussainī, the 49th Aga Khan of the Ismaili Muslims, described Canada as &quot;the most successful pluralist society on the face of our globe&quot;, citing it as &quot;a model for the world&quot;. He explained that the experience of Canadian governance—its commitment to pluralism and its support for the rich multicultural diversity of its people—is something that must be shared and would be of benefit to all societies in other parts of the world. &quot;The Economist&quot; ran a cover story in 2016 praising Canada as the most successful multicultural society in the West. &quot;The Economist&quot; argued that Canada&#x27;s multiculturalism was a source of strength that united the diverse population and by attracting immigrants from around the world was also an engine of economic growth as well. The influence of the transitioned ideology of multiculturalism in the public sphere has led many public and private groups in Canada to work toward supporting both multiculturalism and recent immigrants to Canada. In an effort to support recent Filipino immigrants to Alberta, for example, one school board partnered with a local university and an immigration agency to support these new families in their school and community.

===Mexico===

Mexico has historically always been a multicultural country. After the betrayal of Hernán Cortés to the Aztecs, the Spanish conquered the Aztec Empire and colonized indigenous people. They influenced the indigenous religion, politics, culture and ethnicity. The Spanish opened schools in which they taught Christianity, and the Spanish language eventually surpassed indigenous languages, making it the most spoken language in Mexico. Mestizo was also born from the conquest, which meant being half-Indigenous and half-Spanish.

Mexico City has recently been integrating rapidly, doing much better than many cities in a sample conducted by the Intercultural Cities Index (being the only non-European city, alongside Montreal, on the index). Mexico is an ethnically diverse country with a population composed of approximately 123 million in 2017. There is a wide variety of ethnic groups, the major group being Mestizos followed by White Mexicans and Indigenous Mexicans. There are many other ethnic groups such as Arab Mexicans, Afro-Mexicans and Asian Mexicans.

From the year 2000 to 2010, the number of people in Mexico that were born in another country doubled, reaching a total of 961,121 people, mostly coming from Guatemala and the United States. Mexico is quickly becoming a melting pot, with many immigrants coming into the country. It is considered to be a cradle of civilization, which influences their multiculturalism and diversity, by having different civilizations influence them. A distinguishable trait of Mexico&#x27;s culture is the mestizaje of its people, which caused the combination of Spanish influence, their indigenous roots while also adapting the culture traditions from their immigrants.

=== Peru ===
Peru is an exemplary country of multiculturalism, in 2016 the INEI reported a total population of 31 million people. They share their borders with Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Bolivia, and have welcomed many immigrants into their country creating a diverse community.

Peru is the home to Amerindians but after the Spanish Conquest, the Spanish brought African, and Asian peoples as slaves to Peru creating a mix of ethnic groups. After slavery was no longer permitted in Peru, African-Peruvians and Asian-Peruvians have contributed to Peruvian culture in many ways. Today, Amerindians make up 25.8% of the population, Mestizos 60.2%, White 5.9% and 4.8% is composed by Black, Chinese, Japanese and others. In 1821, Peru&#x27;s president José de San Martín gave foreigners the freedom to start industries in Peru&#x27;s ground, 2 years after, foreigners that lived in Peru for more than 5 years were considered naturalized citizens, which then decreased to 3 years.

===United States===


Although official multiculturalism policy is not established at the federal level, ethnic and cultural diversity is common in rural, suburban and urban areas.

Continuous mass immigration was a feature of the United States economy and society since the first half of the 19th century. The absorption of the stream of immigrants became, in itself, a prominent feature of America&#x27;s national myth. The idea of the melting pot is a metaphor that implies that all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention. The melting pot theory implied that each individual immigrant, and each group of immigrants, assimilated into American society at their own pace. This is different from multiculturalism as it is defined above, which does not include complete assimilation and integration. The melting pot tradition co-exists with a belief in national unity, dating from the American founding fathers:

Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people – a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs... This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.
As a philosophy, multiculturalism began as part of the pragmatism movement at the end of the 19th century in Europe and the United States, then as political and cultural pluralism at the turn of the 20th century. It was partly in response to a new wave of European imperialism in sub-Saharan Africa and the massive immigration of Southern and Eastern Europeans to the United States and Latin America. Philosophers, psychologists and historians and early sociologists such as Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, George Santayana, Horace Kallen, John Dewey, W. E. B. Du Bois and Alain Locke developed concepts of cultural pluralism, from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism. In &quot;Pluralistic Universe&quot; (1909), William James espoused the idea of a &quot;plural society&quot;. James saw pluralism as &quot;crucial to the formation of philosophical and social humanism to help build a better, more egalitarian society.

The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the grade school system, as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier – often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom. Studies estimated 46 million Americans ages 14 to 24 to be the most diverse generation in American society. In 2009 and 2010, controversy erupted in Texas as the state&#x27;s curriculum committee made several changes to the state&#x27;s requirements, often at the expense of minorities. They chose to juxtapose Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s inaugural address with that of Confederate president Jefferson Davis; they debated removing Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and labor-leader Cesar Chavez and rejected calls to include more Hispanic figures, in spite of the high Hispanic population in the state.

According to a 2000 analysis of domestic terrorism in the United States, &quot;A distinctive feature of American terrorism is the ideological diversity of perpetrators. White racists are responsible for over a third of the deaths, and black militants have claimed almost as many. Almost all of the remaining deaths are attributable to Puerto Rican nationalists, Islamic extremists, revolutionary leftists and emigre groups.&quot; Twenty years later, far-right and white racists were observed as the leading perpetrators of domestic terrorism in the U.S. According to a 2020 study by the Strategic &amp; International Studies, right-wing extremists are responsible for the murder of 329 people since 1994 (over half due to the terrorist bombing of the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people).

A 2007 study by Robert Putnam encompassing 30,000 people across the US found that diversity had a negative effect on civic engagement. The greater the diversity, the fewer people voted and the less they volunteered for community projects; also, trust among neighbours was only half that of homogenous communities. Putnam says, however, that &quot;in the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits&quot;, as long as society successfully overcomes the short-term problems. Putnam adds that his &quot;extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society.&quot;

=== Venezuela ===
Venezuela is home to a variety of ethnic groups, with an estimated population of 32 million, . Their population is composed of approximately 68% mestizo, which means of mixed race. Venezuelan culture is mainly composed of a mixture of their indigenous culture, Spanish, and African. There was a heavy influence of Spanish culture due to the Spanish Conquest, which influenced their religion, language and traditions. African influence can be seen in their music. While Spanish is Venezuela&#x27;s main language, there are more than 40 indigenous languages spoken to this day.

=== Colombia ===

Colombia, with an estimated population of 51 million inhabitants, is populated by a great variety of ethnic groups. Approximately 49% of its population is Mestizo, 37% White, 10% African descent, 3.4% Indigenous and 0.6 Gypsy.

It is estimated that 18.8 million Colombians are direct descendants of Europeans, either by one of their parents or grandparents. Mainly from Spain, Italy, Germany, Poland and England, they represent 37% of its population. The Arab descent also predominates in the country. The Syrians, Lebanese and Palestinians are the largest post-independence immigrants to the country, so much so that Colombia has the second largest Arab diaspora in Latin America, with a little more than 3.2 million descendants, which represents 6.4% of its population.

==Europe==


Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Jewish, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age.

In the nineteenth century, the ideology of nationalism transformed the way Europeans thought about the state. Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new nation-states were founded on the principle that each nation is entitled to its own sovereignty and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state; unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally society, although some national movements recognised regional differences.

Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state. The nineteenth century nation-states developed an array of policies – the most important was compulsory primary education in the national language. The language itself was often standardised by a linguistic academy, and regional languages were ignored or suppressed. Some nation-states pursued violent policies of cultural assimilation and even ethnic cleansing.

Some countries in the European Union have introduced policies for &quot;social cohesion&quot;, &quot;integration&quot;, and (sometimes) &quot;assimilation&quot;. The policies include:

* Compulsory courses and/or tests on national history, on the constitution and the legal system (e.g., the computer-based test for individuals seeking naturalisation in the UK named Life in the United Kingdom test)
* Introduction of an official national history, such as the national canon defined for the Netherlands by the van Oostrom Commission, and promotion of that history (e.g., by exhibitions about national heroes)
* Tests designed to elicit &quot;unacceptable&quot; values. In Baden-Württemberg, immigrants are asked what they would do if their son says he is a homosexual (the desired answer is that they would accept it).

Other countries have instituted policies which encourage cultural separation. The concept of &quot;Cultural exception&quot; proposed by France in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations in 1993 was an example of a measure aimed at protecting local cultures.

===Bulgaria===
Since its establishment in the seventh century, Bulgaria has hosted many religions, ethnic groups and nations. The capital city Sofia is the only European city that has peacefully functioning, within walking distance of 300 metres, four Places of worship of the major religions: Eastern Orthodox (St Nedelya Church), Islam (Banya Bashi Mosque), Roman Catholicism (St. Joseph Cathedral), and Orthodox Judaism (Sofia Synagogue, the third-largest synagogue in Europe).

This unique arrangement has been called by historians a &quot;multicultural cliche&quot;. It has also become known as &quot;The Square of Religious Tolerance&quot; and has initiated the construction of a 100-square-metre scale model of the site that is to become a symbol of the capital.

Furthermore, unlike some other Nazi Germany allies or German-occupied countries excluding Denmark, Bulgaria managed to save its entire 48,000-strong Jewish population during World War II from deportation to Nazi concentration camps. According to Dr Marinova-Christidi, the main reason for the efforts of Bulgarian people to save their Jewish population during WWII is that within the region, they &quot;co-existed for centuries with other religions&quot; – giving it a unique multicultural and multiethnic history.

Consequently, within the Balkan region, Bulgaria has become an example for multiculturalism in terms of variety of religions, artistic creativity and ethnicity. Its largest ethnic minority groups, Turks and Roma, enjoy wide political representation. In 1984, following a campaign by the Communist regime for a forcible change of the Islamic names of the Turkish minority, an underground organisation called «National Liberation Movement of the Turks in Bulgaria» was formed which headed the Turkish community&#x27;s opposition movement. On 4 January 1990, the activists of the movement registered an organisation with the legal name Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) (in Bulgarian: Движение за права и свободи: in Turkish: Hak ve Özgürlükler Hareketi) in the Bulgarian city of Varna. At the moment of registration, it had 33 members, at present, according to the organisation&#x27;s website, 68,000 members plus 24,000 in the organisation&#x27;s youth wing . In 2012, Bulgarian Turks were represented at every level of government: local, with MRF having mayors in 35 municipalities, at parliamentary level with MRF having 38 deputies (14% of the votes in Parliamentary elections for 2009–13) and at executive level, where there is one Turkish minister, Vezhdi Rashidov. 21 Roma political organisations were founded between 1997–2003 in Bulgaria.

===France===

After the end of World War II in 1945, immigration significantly increased. During the period of reconstruction, France lacked the labour to do so, and as a result; the French Government was eager to recruit immigrants coming from all over Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia.

Although there was a presence of, Vietnamese in France since the late-nineteenth century (mostly students and workers), a wave of Vietnamese migrated after 1954. These migrants consisted of those who were loyal to the colonial government and those married to French colonists. Following the partition of Vietnam, students and professionals from South Vietnam continued to arrive in France. Although many initially returned to the country after a few years, as the Vietnam War situation worsened, a majority decided to remain in France and brought their families over as well.

This period also saw a significant wave of immigrants from Algeria. As the Algerian War started in 1954, there were already 200,000 Algerian immigrants in France. However, because of the tension between the Algerians and the French, these immigrants were no longer welcome. This conflict between the two sides led to the Paris Massacre of 17 October 1961, when the police used force against an Algerian demonstration on the streets of Paris. After the war, after Algeria gained its independence, the free circulation between France and Algeria was once again allowed, and the number of Algerian immigrants started to increase drastically. From 1962–75, the Algerian immigrant population increased from 350,000 to 700,000. Many of these immigrants were known as the &quot;harkis&quot;, and the others were known as the &quot;pieds-noirs&quot;. The &quot;harkis&quot; were Algerians who supported the French during the Algerian War; once the war was over, they were deeply resented by other Algerians, and thus had to flee to France. The &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; were European settlers who moved to Algeria, but migrated back to France since 1962 when Algeria declared independence.

According to Erik Bleich, multiculturalism in France faced stiff resistance in the educational sector, especially regarding recent Muslim arrivals from Algeria. Gatekeepers often warned that multiculturalism was a threat to the historic basis of French culture.

Jeremy Jennings finds three positions among elites regarding the question of reconciling traditional French Republican principles with multiculturalism. The traditionalists refuse to make any concessions and instead insist on clinging to the historic republican principles of &quot;laïcité&quot; and the secular state in which religion and ethnicity are always ignored. In the middle are modernising republicans who uphold republicanism but also accept some elements of cultural pluralism. Finally there are multiculturalist republicans who envision a pluralist conception of French identity and seek an appreciation of the positive values brought to France by the minority cultures.

A major attack on multiculturalism came in Stasi Report of 2003 which denounces &quot;Islamism&quot; as deeply opposed to the mainstream interpretations of French culture. It is portrayed as a dangerous political agenda that will create a major obstacle for Muslims to comply with French secularism or &quot;laïcité &quot;. Murat Akan, however, argues that the Stasi Report and the new regulations against the hijab and religious symbols in the schools must be set against gestures toward multiculturalism, such as the creation of Muslim schools under contract with the government.

===Germany===

In October 2010, Angela Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at Potsdam, near Berlin, that attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany had &quot;utterly failed&quot;, stating: &quot;The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it does not work&quot;. She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany&#x27;s culture and values. This has added to a growing debate within Germany on the levels of immigration, its effect on Germany and the degree to which middle eastern immigrants have integrated into German society. In 2015, Merkel again criticized multiculturalism on the grounds that it leads to parallel societies.

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community of Germany is the first Muslim group to have been granted &quot;corporation under public law status&quot;, putting the community on par with the major Christian churches and Jewish communities of Germany.

=== Luxembourg ===
Luxembourg has one of the highest foreign-born populations in Europe, foreigners account for nearly half of the country&#x27;s total population. The majority of foreigners are from: Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, and Portugal. In total, 170 different nationalities make up the population of Luxembourg, out of this; 86% are of European descent. The official languages of Luxembourg are German, French, and Luxembourgish all of which are supported in the Luxembourg government and education system. In 2005, Luxembourg officially promoted and implemented the objectives of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. This Convention affirms multicultural policies in Luxembourg and creates political awareness of cultural diversity.

===Netherlands===
Multiculturalism in the Netherlands began with major increases in immigration to the Netherlands during the mid-1950s and 1960s. As a consequence, an official national policy of multiculturalism was adopted in the early-1980s. Different groups could themselves determine religious and cultural matters, while state authorities would handle matters of housing and work policy.

In the 1990s, the public debate were generally optimistic on immigration and the prevailing view was that a multicultural policy would reduce the social economic disparities over time.

This policy subsequently gave way to more assimilationist policies in the 1990s and post-electoral surveys uniformly showed from 1994 onwards that a majority preferred that immigrants assimilated rather than retained the culture of their country of origin.

Following the September 11 attacks in the United States and the murders of Pim Fortuyn (in 2002) and Theo van Gogh (in 2004), there was increased political debate on the role of multiculturalism in the Netherlands.

Lord Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, made a distinction between tolerance and multiculturalism, citing the Netherlands as a tolerant, rather than multicultural, society. In June 2011, the First Rutte cabinet said the Netherlands would turn away from multiculturalism: &quot;Dutch culture, norms and values must be dominant&quot; Minister Donner said.

===Romania===

Since Antiquity, Romania has hosted many religious and ethnic groups, besides Romanians, including Roma people, Hungarians, Germans, Turks, Greeks, Tatars, Slovaks, Serbs, Jews and others. During WW2 and Communism, most of these ethnic groups chose to emigrate to other countries. However, since the 1990s, Romania has received a growing number of immigrants and refugees, most of them from the Arab world, Asia or Africa. Immigration is expected to increase in the future, as large numbers of Romanian workers leave the country and are being replaced by foreigners.

=== Scandinavia ===

Multiculturalism in Scandinavia has centered on discussions about marriage, dress, religious schools, Muslim funeral rites and gender equality. Forced marriages have been widely debated in Denmark, Sweden and Norway but the countries differ in policy and responses by authorities.

Sweden has the most permissive policies while Denmark the most restrictive ones.

==== Denmark ====

In 2001, Denmark, a liberal-conservative coalition government with the support of the Danish People&#x27;s Party which instituted less pluralistic policy, geared more towards assimilation.

A 2018 study found that increases in local ethnic diversity in Denmark caused &quot;rightward shifts in election outcomes by shifting electoral support away from traditional &quot;big government&quot; left‐wing parties and towards anti‐immigrant nationalist parties.&quot;

For decades, Danish immigration policy was built upon the belief that, with support, immigrants and their descendants would eventually reach the same levels of education as Danes. In a 2019 report, the Danish Immigration Service and the Ministry of Education found this to be false. The report found that, while the second-generation immigrants without a Western background do better than their parents, the same is not true for third-generation immigrants. One of the reasons given was that second-generation immigrants may marry someone from their country of origin, which may cause Danish not to be spoken at home, which would put the children at a disadvantage in school. Thereby, the process of integrating has to start from the beginning for each generation.

==== Norway ====
Apart from citizens of Nordic countries, all foreigners must apply for permanent residency in order to live and work in Norway. In 2017, the Norwegian immigrant population was made up of: citizens of EU and EEA countries (41.2%); citizens of Asian countries, including Turkey (32.4%); citizens of African countries (13.7%); and citizens of non-EU/EEA European, North American, South American and Oceanian countries (12.7%).

In 2015, during the European migrant crisis, a total of 31,145 asylum seekers, most of whom came from Afghanistan and Syria, crossed the Norwegian border. In 2016, the number of asylum seekers dramatically reduced by almost 90%, with 3460 asylum seekers coming to Norway. This was partly due to the stricter border control across Europe, including an agreement between the EU and Turkey.

As of September 2019, 15 foreign residents who had travelled from Norway to Syria or Iraq to join the Islamic State have had their residence permits revoked.

The Progress Party has named the reduction of high levels of immigration from non-European countries one of their goals:
: &quot;Immigration from countries outside the EEA must be strictly enforced to ensure a successful integration. It can not be accepted that fundamental Western values and human rights are set aside by cultures and attitudes that certain groups of immigrants bring with them to Norway.&quot;

An extreme form of opposition to immigration in Norway were the 22/7 attacks carried out by the terrorist Anders Behring Breivik on 22 July 2011. He killed 8 people by bombing government buildings in Oslo and massacred 69 young people at a youth summer camp held by the Labour Party, who were in power at the time. He blamed the party for the high level of Muslim immigration and accused it of &quot;promoting multiculturalism&quot;.

==== Sweden ====

Sweden has from the early 1970s experienced a greater share of non-Western immigration than the other Scandinavian countries, which consequently have placed multiculturalism on the political agenda for a longer period of time.

Sweden was the first country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism in Europe. On 14 May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the social democratic government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies. Despite the anti-multiculturalist protestations of the Sweden Democrats, multiculturalism remains official policy in Sweden.

A 2008 study which involved questionnaires sent to 5,000 people, showed that less than a quarter of the respondents (23%) wanted to live in areas characterised by cultural, ethnic and social diversity.

A 2014 study published by Gävle University College showed that 38% of the population never interacted with anyone from Africa and 20% never interacted with any non-Europeans. The study concluded that while physical distance to the country of origin, also religion and other cultural expressions are significant for the perception of cultural familiarity. In general, peoples with Christianity as the dominant religion were perceived to be culturally closer than peoples from Muslim countries.

A 2017 study by Lund University also found that social trust was lower among people in regions with high levels of past non-Nordic immigration than among people in regions with low levels of past immigration. The erosive effect on trust was more pronounced for immigration from culturally distant countries.

===Serbia===

In Serbia, there are 19 officially recognised ethnic groups with a status of national minorities. Vojvodina is an autonomous province of Serbia, located in the northern part of the country. It has a multiethnic and multicultural identity; there are more than 26 ethnic groups in the province, which has six official languages. Largest ethnic groups in Vojvodina are Serbs (67%), Hungarians (13%), Slovaks, Croats, Romani, Romanians, Montenegrins, Bunjevci, Bosniaks, Rusyns. The Chinese and Arabs, are the only two significant immigrant minorities in Serbia.

Radio Television of Vojvodina broadcasts program in ten local languages. The project by the Government of AP Vojvodina titled &quot;Promotion of Multiculturalism and Tolerance in Vojvodina&quot;, whose primary goal is to foster the cultural diversity and develop the atmosphere of interethnic tolerance among the citizens of Vojvodina, has been successfully implemented since 2005. Serbia is continually working on improving its relationship and inclusion of minorities in its effort to gain full accession to the European Union. Serbia has initiated talks through Stabilisation and Association Agreement on 7 November 2007.

===United Kingdom===

Multicultural policies were adopted by local administrations from the 1970s and 1980s onwards. In 1997, the newly elected Labour government committed to a multiculturalist approach at a national level, but after 2001, there was something of a backlash, led by centre-left commentators such as David Goodhart and Trevor Phillips. The Government then embraced a policy of community cohesion instead. In 2011, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron said in a speech that &quot;state multiculturalism has failed&quot;. Critics argue that analyses which view society as &#x27;too diverse&#x27; for social democracy and cohesion have &quot;performative&quot; effects regarding legitimate racism towards those classed as immigrants. Others, however, like author Ed West, criticize the notion that the United Kingdom is or should be a multicultural society in the first place and that the project of diversity is misguided.

===Russian Federation===
The idea of multiculturalism in Russia is closely linked to the territory and the Soviet concept of &quot;nationality&quot;. The Federation is divided into a series of republics where each ethnic group has preponderance in deciding the laws that affect that republic. A distinction is then made between &quot;Rossiyane&quot; (Russian citizens) and &quot;Russkie&quot; (ethnic Russians).

Each people within their territories has the right to practice their customs and traditions and even to impose their own laws, as is the case in Chechnya, as long as they do not violate federal and constitutional laws of the Russian Federation.

==Asia==
===India===
According to the 1961 Census of India, there are 1652 indigenous languages in the country. The culture of India has been shaped by its long history, unique geography and diverse demography. India&#x27;s languages, religions, dance, music, architecture and customs differ from place to place within the country, but nevertheless possess a commonality. The culture of India is an amalgamation of these diverse sub-cultures spread all over the Indian subcontinent and traditions that are several millennia old. The previously prevalent Indian caste system describes the social stratification and social restrictions in the Indian subcontinent, in which social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed &quot;jātis&quot; or castes.

Religiously, Hindus form the majority, followed by Muslims. The statistics are: Hindu (79.8%), Muslim (14.2%), Christian (2.3%), Sikh (1.7%), Buddhist (0.7%), Jain (0.4%), Unaffiliated (0.23%), Baháʼís, Jews, Zoroastrians, and others (0.65%). Linguistically, the two main language families in India are Indo-Aryan (a branch of Indo-European) and Dravidian. In India&#x27;s northeast, people speaking Sino-Tibetan group of languages such as Meitei (Meitei-lon) and Bodo recognized by the Indian constitution and Austroasiatic languages are commonly found. India (officially) follows a three-language policy. Hindi (spoken in the form of Hindustani) is the official federal language, English has the federal status of associate/subsidiary official language and each state has its own state official language (in the Hindi &quot;sprachraum&quot;, this reduces to bilingualism). Further, India does not have any national language. The Republic of India&#x27;s state boundaries are largely drawn based on linguistic groups; this decision led to the preservation and continuation of local ethno-linguistic sub-cultures, except for the Hindi &quot;sprachraum&quot; which is itself divided into many states. Thus, most states differ from one another in language, culture, cuisine, clothing, literary style, architecture, music and festivities.

India has encountered religiously motivated violence, such as the Moplah Riots, the Bombay riots, the 1984 Sikh genocide, the 1990 Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus, the 2002 Gujarat riots, the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the 2012 Assam violence, the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, and the 2020 Delhi riots. This has resulted from traditionally disadvantaged communities in public employment such as the policing of the same locality, apprehension of owners in giving properties for sale or rent and of society in accepting inter-marriages.

==== Cultural minorities in India ====
The Indian constitution requires the various state-run institutions to provide quotas for minorities, which give these cultural minorities equal opportunities, as well as a forum through which they can actively participate in the institutions of the dominant culture. Indian polity after the 1990s has been marked by a shift from secular principles to a landscape that is dominated by pro-Hindu propaganda; the Bhartiya Janata Party has used this rhetoric by reconstructing Hinduism and bartering it under the guise of Indian nationalism. However, the rise of pro-Hindu ideology, commonly known as Hindutva, has impinged on the rights of cultural minorities. This can be seen in the large scale violence against cultural minorities, the votebank politics used by the Indian National Congress, and the promotion of issues faced by the larger religious communities over those faced by the backward groups in religious minorities.

==== Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Castes (OBC) ====
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are constitutionally recognized terms in India and constitute approximately 25% of the Indian population. Moreover more than 40 percent of India&#x27;s population belongs to the Other Backward Castes as per the National Sample Survey Office or the NSSO which is a government organization for conducting surveys in India. So the total size of the lower castes in India is estimated to be around 70 percent of the country&#x27;s population whereas the upper caste make up around 18 percent of the population. These groups have been provided with reservations that constitutionally guarantee them representation in governmental institutions, a mandate suggested by the Mandal Commission. The Indian constitution also provides SC&#x27;s and ST&#x27;s with protective measures that ensure equality, which is the main issue faced by members of both communities. However, while scheduled castes have turned into important political communities that the state concerns itself about, scheduled tribes continue to be politically marginalized.

===Indonesia===

Pluralism, diversity and multiculturalism is a daily fact of life in Indonesia. There are over 600 ethnic groups in Indonesia. 95% of those are of Native Indonesian ancestry. The Javanese are the largest ethnic group in Indonesia who make up nearly 42% of the total population. The Sundanese, Malay, and Madurese are the next largest groups in the country. There are also more than 700 living languages spoken in Indonesia and although predominantly Muslim the country also has large Christian and Hindu populations.

Indonesia&#x27;s national motto, &quot;Bhinneka Tunggal Ika&quot; (&quot;Unity in Diversity&quot; lit. &quot;many, yet one&quot;) enshrined in Pancasila the national ideology, articulates the diversity that shapes the country. The government nurtures and promotes the diversity of Indonesian local culture; adopting a pluralist approach.

Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government transmigration programs or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. The Javanese for example, moved from their traditional homeland in Java to the other parts of the archipelago. The expansion of the Javanese and their influence throughout Indonesia has raised the issue of Javanization, although Minangkabau, Malay, Madurese, Bugis and Makassar people, as a result of their &quot;merantau&quot; (migrating) culture are also quite widely distributed throughout the Indonesian archipelago, while Chinese Indonesians can be found in most urban areas. Because of urbanization, major Indonesian cities such as Greater Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Palembang, Medan and Makassar have attracted large numbers of Indonesians from various ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. Jakarta in particular has almost all Indonesian ethnic groups represented.

However, this transmigration program and close interactions between people of different cultural backgrounds caused socio-cultural problems, as the inter-ethnics interactions have not always been conducted harmoniously. After the fall of Suharto in 1998 into the 2000s, numbers of inter-ethnic and inter-religious clashes erupted in Indonesia. Like the clashes between native Dayak tribes against Madurese transmigrants in Kalimantan during Sambas riots in 1999 and the Sampit conflict in 2001. There were also clashes between Muslims and Christians, such as violence erupted in Poso between 1998 and into 2000, and violences in Maluku between 1999 and into 2002. Nevertheless, Indonesia today still struggles and has managed to maintain unity and inter-cultural harmony, through a national adherence of pro-pluralism policy of Pancasila; promoted and enforced by the government and its people.

Chinese Indonesians are the largest foreign-origin minority that has resided in Indonesia for generations. Despite centuries of acculturation with native Indonesians, because of their disproportionate influence on Indonesian economy, and alleged question of national loyalty, Chinese Indonesians have suffered discrimination. The Suharto &quot;Orde Baru&quot; or New Order adopted a forced assimilation policy; which indicated that Chinese cultural elements were unacceptable. Chinese Indonesians were forced to adopt Indonesian-sounding names, and the use of Chinese culture and language was banned. The violence targeting Chinese Indonesians erupted during riots in 1998. As the looting and destruction took place, a number of Chinese Indonesians, as well as looters, were killed. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, a result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policies enforced during Suharto&#x27;s New Order regime. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, Abdurrahman Wahid came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to promote acceptance and to improve inter-racial relationships, such as abolishing the ban on Chinese culture; allowing Chinese traditions to be practised freely. Two years later President Megawati Sukarnoputri declared that the Chinese New Year (&quot;&quot;) would be marked as a national holiday from 2003. Tense incidents however have included attacks on Chinese temples and Indonesian politician Basuki Tjahaja Purnama being given a two year prison sentence for blasphemy due to comments he made to his supporters in September 2016.

===Kazakhstan===

There are sizeable populations of ethnic Kazakhs, Russians, Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Uighurs, Tatars, Germans and more in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan was one of a few countries in post-Soviet territories that avoided interethnic clashes and conflicts in the period of USSR&#x27;s final crisis and its eventual breakup. In 1995, Kazakhstan created the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan, an advisory body designed to represent the country&#x27;s ethnic minorities. However, recent ethnic clashes and discrimination have been reported for groups such as Christians, ultraconservative Muslims, ethnic Dungans, Chechens, Tajiks, and LGBT people.

=== Malaysia ===

Malaysia is a multiethnic country, with Malays making up the majority, close to 58% of the population. About 25% of the population are Malaysians of Chinese descent. Malaysians of Indian descent comprise about 7% of the population. The remaining 10% comprises:
* Native East Malaysians, namely Bajau, Bruneian, Bidayuh, Dusun, Iban, Kadazan, Kedayan, Melanau, Orang Ulu, Sarawakian Malays, etc.
* Other native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia, such as the Orang Asli and Siamese people, and
* Non-native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia such as the Chettiars, the Peranakan and the Portuguese.

The Malaysian New Economic Policy or NEP serves as a form of &quot;racial equalization&quot; in the view of the Malay-controlled government. It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration. Established after the 13 May racial riots of 1969, it sought to address the &quot;significant imbalance&quot; in the economic sphere where the minority especially the Chinese population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country. Critics of this policy has called it synonymous to racial discrimination and synonymous to Apartheid.

The Malay Peninsula has a long history of international trade contacts, influencing its ethnic and religious composition. Predominantly Malays before the 18th century, the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries, and imported Chinese and Indian labor. Several regions in the then British Malaya such as Penang, Malacca and Singapore became Chinese dominated. Until the riots 1969, co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, although the three main racial groups for the most part lived in separate communities – the Malays in the villages, the Chinese in the urban areas, and the Indians in the towns and plantation. More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of institutionalized discrimination.

Preceding independence of the Federation of Malaya, a social contract was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the 1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays&#x27; special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the Bumiputra policy.

These pluralist policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial status of religious freedom in Malaysia.

===Singapore===
Due to historical immigration trends, Singapore has a Chinese majority population with significant minority populations of Malays and Indians (predominantly Tamils). Other prominent smaller groups include Peranakans, Arabs, Armenians, Eurasians, Europeans, Americans, and Canadians. Besides English, Singapore recognizes three other languages—Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Tamil. English was established as the medium of instruction in schools during the 1960s and 1970s and is the language of trade and government while the other three languages are taught as second languages (&quot;mother tongues&quot;). Besides being a multilingual country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by the three main ethnic communities.

Under the Raffles Plan of Singapore, the city was divided into ethnic enclaves such as Geylang, Chinatown, and Little India. Housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy, which ensures an even ethnic distribution throughout Singapore. A similar policy exists in politics as all Group Representation Constituencies are required to field at least one candidate from an ethnic minority.

Today, such ethnic enclaves has mostly been eliminated, due to the contemporary Singapore&#x27;s government policy to encourage further ethnic integration between the different races of Singapore. A prominent example is its public housing system. Unlike other countries, public housing is not ostracised by a wide majority of the population and its government, and acts as a necessary and vital measure to provide immaculate and safe housing surrounded by public amenities at affordable prices, especially during its rapid development and industrialisation in the early years of independence. It is also meant to foster social cohesion between the social classes and races of Singapore, and prevent neglected areas or districts and ethnic enclaves from developing – known as the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP). As such, it is considered a unique part of Singaporean culture, being commonly associated with the country.

===South Korea===

South Korea remains a relatively homogenous country ethnically, linguistically, and culturally. Foreigners, expatriates, and immigrants are often rejected by the mainstream South Korean society and face discrimination. This can be seen as a result of World War II where the first noteworthy wave of multiculturalism between American servicemen and Korean women occurred. South Korea has been long regarded as an ethnic homogeneous country, therefore, the rise in mixed-race children was seen as a new phenomenon. Before the 1990s, the term &quot;honhyeol&quot; was commonly used to identify multiracial individuals in Korea – primarily in relation to the children of Korean women and American servicemen; this common term strengthened the association of multiracial people with a sense of alienation, rather than promoting cultural diversity within Korea. Not only did this term effectively discriminate against mixed-race Koreans but it also made a clear distinction between native Koreans and mixed-race Koreans.

Han Geon-Soo 2007 notes the increased use of the word &quot;multiculturalism&quot; in South Korea: &quot;As the increase of foreign migrants in [South] Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogeneous [South] Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, [the South] Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement.&quot; He argued, however, that &quot;the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in [South] Korea&quot; lacked &quot;the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society&quot;.

The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued:
:&quot;Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society. It made that decision years ago – perhaps unconsciously – when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy. It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast-growing society. Korea is faced by a different decision today: what type of multicultural society does it want to be?&quot;

The &quot;Korea Times&quot; suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society. In 2010, an opinion editorial written by Peter Underwood for the &quot;JoongAng Ilbo&quot; stated: &quot;Media in [South] Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in [South] Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures.&quot; He further opined:
:&quot;If you stay too long, Koreans become uncomfortable with you. [...] Having a two percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea&#x27;s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad. Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions. While it will undermine the homogeneity, it will enrich Koreans with a better understanding of themselves.&quot;

In 2010, results from the Korean Identity Survey suggested that government programs promoting multiculturalism had seen some success with over 60% of Koreans supporting the idea a multicultural society. However, the same poll in 2015 showed that support of a multicultural society had dropped to 49.7% suggesting a possible return to ethnic exclusivism.

=== Turkey ===

Turkey is a country that borders both Europe and Asia. It is home to several ethnic groups including Turkish, Arab, Armenian, Assyrian, Greek, Kurdish, and Jewish. There are cultural influences dating back to ancient Hellenic, Semitic and Iranian civilizations which diffused and mingled in myriad ways over a period of centuries.

In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the Ottoman past.

===Cameroon===
Officially known as the Republic of Cameroon, Cameroon is found in central Africa consisting of a diverse geographical and cultural area that makes it one of the most diverse countries known today. Ranging from mountains, deserts, and rainforests, to coast-lands and savanna grasslands, its diverse geography makes a large diverse population possible. This diverse geography resembles Africa as a whole and due to this, many people commonly label Cameroon as &quot;Africa in Miniature&quot;.

==== Demographics and official languages ====
Before Cameroon&#x27;s independence, it was under British and French colonial rule from 1916–1961. Upon gaining sovereignty, a major colonial influence was evident, having both English and French become the national language to roughly 25,000,000 Cameroonian residents. Apart from these two major languages, a new language consisting of a mixture of French, English, and Pidgin known as Frananglais gained popularity among Cameroonian residents.

==== Indigenous languages ====
Although these three languages are the most common in Cameroon, there are still approximately 273 indigenous languages being spoken throughout the country, making it not only culturally diverse but linguistically as well. Among those who speak these indigenous languages are people from Bantu, Sudanic, Baka, Wodaabe (or Mbororo) and even primitive hunter-gatherer groups known as Pygmies.

==== Indigenous peoples&#x27; rights ====
Although native to Cameroonian land, they faced constant discrimination much like other indigenous groups around the world. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the United Nations&#x27; Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) in 2007. What this allowed was the protection of land and resource rights and prevented others from or violating them. In 2016, a group of indigenous Baka and Bagyeli groups united to form Gbabandi. Gbabandi allowed these indigenous groups to have a form of representation and a declared list of requirements that people of Cameroon had to abide by. Among these requirements were guaranteed land rights, peoples&#x27; consent to the usage of their sacred land, traditional chiefs and the ability to participate in &quot;local, regional, and national levels&quot; of political and economic matters. As a result, this established a sense of justice and acknowledgment among indigenous groups in Cameroon and posed for future battles for indigenous peoples&#x27; rights.

===Mauritius===
Multiculturalism has been a characteristic feature of the island of Mauritius. This is mainly because of colonization that has been present from, the English, the French, and the Dutch. However, the Mauritian society includes people from many different ethnic and religious groups: Hindu, Muslim and Indo-Mauritians, Mauritian Creoles (of African and Malagasy descent), Buddhist and Roman Catholic Sino-Mauritians and Franco-Mauritians (descendants of the original French colonists). Mauritius has embraced intertwining of cultures from the origin of the country, and has coined the term fruit-salad, which is a much more appealing term in comparison to melting-pot showing that they were not forced to these cultures.

=== South Africa ===

South Africa is the fifth-most populous country and one of the most developed countries in Africa. South Africa also officially recognises 11 languages including English, making it third behind Bolivia and India in most official languages. The three most common languages are Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans. Though South Africa&#x27;s cultural traditions may decline as it becomes more and more Westernised due to its development, it is still known for its diverse culture.

== Oceania ==

===Australia===

The next country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism after Canada was Australia, a country with similar immigration situations and similar policies, for example the formation of the Special Broadcasting Service. The Australian Government retains multiculturalism in policy and as a defining aspect of Australia today.
The White Australia Policy was dismantled after World War II by various changes to immigration policy, although the official policy of multiculturalism was not formally introduced until 1972. The election of John Howard&#x27;s Liberal-National Coalition government in 1996 was a major watershed for Australian multiculturalism. Howard had long been a critic of multiculturalism, releasing his One Australia policy in the late 1980s. &quot;A Practical Reference to Religious Diversity for Operational Police and Emergency Services&quot;, first published in 1999, was a publication of the Australasian Police Multicultural Advisory Bureau designed to offer guidance to police and emergency services personnel on how religious affiliation can affect their contact with the public. The first edition covered Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish and Sikh faiths, with participation of representatives of the various religions. The second edition, published in 2002, added Christian, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander religions and the Baháʼí Faith to the list of religions.

Contact between people of different cultures in Australia has been characterised by tolerance and engagement, but have also occasionally resulted in conflict and rifts. Australia&#x27;s diverse migrant communities have brought with them food, lifestyle and cultural practices, many of which have been absorbed into mainstream Australian culture.

Members of a multicultural community who are not of English-speaking Anglo-Australian, Anglo-Saxon or ‘Anglo-Celtic’ Australian background or not &quot;assimilated&quot; are often referred to in policy discourse as culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD), introduced in 1996 to replace non-English speaking background (NESB).

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand is a sovereign Oceanic country that adopted its multicultural policies post World War II. The country used to have immigration policies similar to Australia&#x27;s White Australia Policy and the United States Immigration Act of 1924, but it would later follow suit with Australia and Canada in the 1970s and adopt similar multicultural policies. The relaxation of migration led to an influx of new migration to New Zealand in the 1980s. This led to an increase of Asian and Pacific islander peoples on the island, and ultimately a more diverse European population. In 1985, the Law Commission Act was passed which required the New Zealand Law Commission to review laws while taking into account both the indigenous Māori of New Zealand and New Zealand&#x27;s multicultural character. In 1987, New Zealand officially recognized the indigenous Māori language as a national language. The revitalization in the Māori language led to its immersion in schools and television broadcast.

In 2001, the New Zealand government opened an Office of Ethnic Affairs to advise its local governments on the advancement of ethnic diversity and affairs of its multicultural communities. Many landmarks on the island have both their Māori and English names officially recognized. Māori makes up 3.7% of the population&#x27;s speaking language. A 2013 census of New Zealand&#x27;s population showed that 74% of the population identifies ethnically as European, while the latter 15% majority identify as Māori. The remainder identify as Asian, Arab, African, Pacific Islander and Latin American.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
Papua New Guinea has one of the most heterogeneous indigenous populations in the world: there are several thousand separate communities, most with only a few hundred people. This Oceanian country is home to over eight million people that are divided into hundreds of different indigenous ethnic groups and cultures with over 820 different indigenous languages. A majority of the indigenous groups are Papuans who have ancestors that lived in New Guinea over ten thousand years ago. The latter majority are Austronesians whose ancestors arrived less than four thousand years ago. The island&#x27;s population is also made up of many expatriate citizens from China, Australia, Indonesia, Europe and the Philippines. In 1975, the island population was found to be made up of 40,000 of these diverse expatriate citizens. Despite the large amount of culturally diverse locations on the island, the Kuk Early Agricultural Site is the only UNESCO World heritage location.

<doc id="51888" wikidata="Q185658" url="?curid=51888" title="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade">
<text>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American action adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Jeffrey Boam, based on a story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes. It is the third installment in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series and the sequel to &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). Harrison Ford returned in the title role, while his father is portrayed by Sean Connery. Other cast members featured include Alison Doody, Denholm Elliott, Julian Glover, River Phoenix, and John Rhys-Davies. In the film, set in 1938, Indiana Jones searches for his father, a Holy Grail scholar, who has been kidnapped and held hostage by the Nazis while on a journey to find the Holy Grail.

After the criticism that &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984) received, Spielberg chose to make a more lighthearted film for the next installment, as well as bringing back several elements from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. During the five years between &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; and &quot;The Last Crusade&quot;, he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting Jeffrey Boam&#x27;s. Filming locations included Spain, Italy, West Germany, Jordan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

&quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; was released in the United States on May 24, 1989, by Paramount Pictures. The film received positive reviews and was a financial success, earning $474.2 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 1989. It also won the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing and was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Sound at the 62nd Academy Awards. Although Spielberg and Lucas originally intended for &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; to be the end of the series, a sequel, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, followed in May 2008, while a fifth and final film, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;, was released in June 2023.

==Plot==
In 1912, Boy Scout Indiana Jones lives with his father Henry Jones Sr. in Moab, Utah. One day, while undergoing a cave exploration, Indy takes a crucifix owned by Coronado from a group of graverobbers led by a man named Garth, and after a brief horse chase, flees to his home, where Garth and his men find him and retrieve the crucifix. Garth, however, admits his respect towards Indiana and gives him his fedora before leaving.

In 1938, Indy successfully takes back the crucifix from the employer of the graverobbers off the Portuguese coast. After returning to the United States, Indy learns Henry has disappeared while searching for the Holy Grail. Walter Donovan, his father&#x27;s financial backer, tasks Indy with finding both Henry and the Grail. Indy receives a package containing Henry&#x27;s diary, which includes his research on the Grail, and travels to Venice alongside Marcus Brody to meet Henry&#x27;s associate Elsa Schneider. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover a catacomb containing an inscribed shield which reveals that the path to the Grail begins in Alexandretta. The two are subsequently attacked by a mysterious group who reveal themselves to be the secret Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, dedicated to protecting the Grail. After saving the group&#x27;s leader Kazim, Indy learns that Henry is being held at a castle in Austria. Indy entrusts Marcus with a map from the diary detailing a route to the Grail and sends him to Alexandretta to rendezvous with their old friend Sallah. Discovering their rooms have been ransacked, Indy reveals the diary&#x27;s existence to Elsa before they sleep together.

In Austria, Indy and Elsa infiltrate the castle, discovering it to be under Nazi control. Indy finds Henry and tries to escape, but surrenders after Elsa is held captive by the Nazis. She reveals herself to be a Nazi collaborator and takes the diary, and Indy and Henry are tied up and learn that Donovan is also working with the Nazis. After arriving in Alexandretta, Marcus is captured by the Nazis as well. Elsa returns to Germany, while Indy and Henry escape the castle before traveling to Berlin to retrieve the diary. After recovering it from Elsa, Indy and Henry flee on a Zeppelin before evading two Luftwaffe planes pursuing them.

Once Indy and Henry arrive in Hatay, Sallah informs them that the Nazis have also traveled there using the map. While they are following the trail, the Nazis are attacked by the Brotherhood but defeat them. Henry takes advantage of the distraction to try to rescue Marcus but is captured; Indy attacks the Nazi convoy in response and is eventually able to destroy it with help from Henry and Marcus. Indy, Henry, Marcus and Sallah proceed to a temple containing the Grail, where they observe the Nazis attempting to overcome the temple&#x27;s traps before being captured. Donovan forces Indy to find safe passage for them by mortally wounding Henry; a drink from the Grail can heal him. With the help of the diary, Indy overcomes the traps and finds a room with many cups and an ancient knight, who explains that only one cup is the true Grail. Donovan and Elsa enter the room, and Elsa deliberately gives him the wrong cup, killing Donovan after he drinks from it. Indy identifies the true Grail and rescues Henry. Elsa falls to her death when her attempt to leave with the Grail causes the temple to collapse, and Indy nearly suffers the same fate before Henry saves him. The Grail falls into an abyss as Indy and his companions escape and ride off into the sunset.

==Cast==

* Harrison Ford as Henry &quot;Indiana&quot; Jones Jr.: An archaeologist, professor and adventurer who seeks to rescue his father and find the Holy Grail. Ford said he loved the idea of introducing Indiana&#x27;s father because it allowed him to explore another side to Indiana&#x27;s personality: &quot;These are men who have never made any accommodation to each other. Indy behaves differently in his father&#x27;s presence. Who else would dare call Indy &#x27;junior&#x27;?&quot;
** River Phoenix as a younger Indiana Jones. Phoenix had portrayed the son of Ford&#x27;s character in &quot;The Mosquito Coast&quot; (1986). Ford recommended Phoenix for the part; he said that of the young actors working at the time, Phoenix looked the most like him when he was around that age.
* Sean Connery as Henry Jones Sr.: Indiana&#x27;s father, a professor of medieval literature who cared more about looking for the Grail than raising his son. Spielberg had Connery in mind when he suggested introducing Indiana&#x27;s father, though he did not tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as &quot;a crazy, eccentric&quot; professor resembling Laurence Olivier, whose relationship with Indiana is &quot;strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son&quot;. Spielberg had been a fan of Connery&#x27;s work as James Bond and felt that no one else could perform the role as well. Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride wrote, &quot;Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery&#x27;s &quot;James Bond&quot; films.&quot; Connery, who had eschewed major franchise films since his work on the James Bond series, as he found those roles dull and wanted to avoid paparazzi attention, initially turned the role down (as he was only twelve years older than Ford) but eventually relented. Connery—a student of history—began to reshape the character, and revisions were made to the script to address his concerns. &quot;I wanted to play Henry Jones as a kind of Richard Francis Burton,&quot; Connery commented. &quot;I was bound to have fun with the role of a gruff, Victorian Scottish father.&quot; Connery believed Henry should be a match for his son, telling Spielberg that &quot;whatever Indy&#x27;d done my character has done and my character has done it better&quot;. Connery signed to the film on March 25, 1988. He improvised the line, &quot;She talks in her sleep&quot;, which was left in because it made everyone laugh; in Boam&#x27;s scripts, Henry telling Indiana that he slept with Elsa occurs later.
** Alex Hyde-White plays Henry in the film&#x27;s prologue, though his face is never shown and his lines were dubbed by Connery.
* Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody: Indiana&#x27;s bumbling English colleague. Elliott returned after Spielberg sought to recapture the tone of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), following the actor&#x27;s absence in the darker &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984).
* Alison Doody as Dr. Elsa Schneider: An Austrian art professor and Indy&#x27;s love interest, who is in league with the Nazis. She seduces the Joneses to trick them, but appears to have genuine feelings for Indy. While the character of Elsa is in her 30s during the film, Doody was 21 when she auditioned and was one of the first actresses who met for the part. Amanda Redman was offered the role, but declined. 
* John Rhys-Davies as Sallah: A friend of Indiana and a professional excavator living in Cairo. Like Elliott&#x27;s, Rhys-Davies&#x27;s return was an attempt to recapture the spirit of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.
* Julian Glover as Walter Donovan: An American businessman who sends the Joneses on their quest for the Holy Grail out of a desire for immortality while secretly working with the Nazis for the same goal. Glover previously appeared as General Veers in Lucas&#x27;s &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. He originally auditioned for the role of Vogel. Glover, who is English, adopted an American accent for the film, but was dissatisfied with the result.
* Michael Byrne as Ernst Vogel: A brutal &quot;SS&quot; colonel. Byrne and Ford had previously starred in &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1978), in which they also respectively played a German and an American. 

Kevork Malikyan portrays Kazim, the leader of the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, an organization that protects the Holy Grail. Malikyan had impressed Spielberg with his performance in &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (1978) and would have auditioned for the role of Sallah in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; had a traffic jam not delayed his meeting with the director. Robert Eddison appears as the Grail Knight, the guardian of the Grail who drank from the cup of Christ during the Crusades. Eddison was a stage and television veteran only appearing in a few films since the 1930s (including a supporting role in Peter Ustinov&#x27;s 1948 comedy &quot;Vice Versa&quot;). Glover recalled Eddison was excited and nervous for his return to film, often asking if he had performed correctly. Laurence Olivier was originally considered to play the Grail Knight, but he was too ill and died the same year in which the film was released.

Michael Sheard appears as Adolf Hitler, whom Jones briefly encounters at the book-burning rally in Berlin. Although a non-speaking role, Sheard could speak German and had already portrayed Hitler three times during his career. He had also appeared as Admiral Ozzel in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and as Oskar Schomburg in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. In the same scene, Ronald Lacey, who played Toht in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, cameos as Heinrich Himmler. Alexei Sayle played the fictional &quot;sultan&quot; of Hatay. (In fact, Hatay State was a republic.) Paul Maxwell portrayed &quot;the man with the Panama Hat&quot; who took possession of the Cross of Coronado. Wrestler and stuntman Pat Roach, who played three roles in the previous two films, made a short cameo as the Nazi who accompanies Vogel to the Zeppelin. Roach was set to film a fight with Ford, but it was cut. In a deleted scene, Roach&#x27;s agent boards the second biplane on the Zeppelin with a World War I flying ace (played by Frederick Jaeger), only for the pair to fall to their deaths after the flying ace makes an error. Richard Young played Garth, the leader of the tomb robbers who chased young Indiana Jones and then gives him his hat. Eugene Lipinski portrayed the mysterious agent G-Man, while Vernon Dobtcheff appeared as the butler of Castle Brunwald.

==Production==
===Development===
George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had intended to make a trilogy of &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films since Lucas had first pitched &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; to Spielberg in 1977, though they signed for five films with Paramount Pictures by 1979. After the mixed critical and public reaction to &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, Spielberg decided to complete the trilogy to fulfill his promise to Lucas, with the intent to invoke the film with the spirit and tone of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; writers Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz chose not to return due to both having other commitments and feeling satisfied with their work in the second film. Throughout the film&#x27;s development and pre-production, Spielberg admitted he was &quot;consciously regressing&quot; in making the film. Due to his commitment to the film, the director had to drop out of directing &quot;Big&quot; and &quot;Rain Man&quot;.

Lucas initially suggested making the film &quot;a haunted mansion movie&quot;, for which &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; writer Diane Thomas wrote a script. Spielberg rejected the idea because of the similarity to &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, which he had co-written and produced. Lucas first introduced the Holy Grail in an idea for the film&#x27;s prologue, which was to be set in Scotland. He intended the Grail to have a pagan basis, with the rest of the film revolving around a separate Christian artifact in Africa. Spielberg did not care for the Grail idea, which he found too esoteric, even after Lucas suggested giving it healing powers and the ability to grant immortality (much like the fictional magical power given to the Ark in the first film of the trilogy). In September 1984, Lucas completed an eight-page treatment titled &quot;Indiana Jones and the Monkey King&quot;, which he soon followed with an 11-page outline. The story saw Indiana battling a ghost in Scotland before finding the Fountain of Youth in Africa.

Chris Columbus—who had written the Spielberg-produced &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;The Goonies&quot;, and &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;—was hired to write the script. His first draft, dated May 3, 1985, changed the main plot device to a Garden of Immortal Peaches. It begins in 1937, with Indiana battling the murderous ghost of Baron Seamus Seagrove III in Scotland. Indiana travels to Mozambique to aid Dr. Clare Clarke (a Katharine Hepburn-type according to Lucas), who has found a 200-year-old pygmy. The pygmy is kidnapped by the Nazis during a boat chase, and Indiana, Clare and Scraggy Brier—an old friend of Indiana—travel up the Zambezi river to rescue him. Indiana is killed in the climactic battle but is resurrected by the Monkey King. Other characters include a cannibalistic African tribe; Nazi Sergeant Gutterbuhg, who has a mechanical arm; Betsy, a stowaway student who is suicidally in love with Indiana; and a pirate leader named Kezure (described as a Toshiro Mifune-type), who dies eating a peach because he is not pure of heart.

Columbus&#x27;s second draft, dated August 6, 1985, removed Betsy and featured Dash—an expatriate bar owner for whom the Nazis work—and the Monkey King as villains. The Monkey King forces Indiana and Dash to play chess with real people and disintegrates each person who is captured. Indiana subsequently battles the undead, destroys the Monkey King&#x27;s rod, and marries Clare. Location scouting commenced in Africa but Spielberg and Lucas abandoned &quot;Monkey King&quot; because of its negative depiction of African natives, and because the script was too unrealistic. Spielberg acknowledged that it made him &quot;... feel very old, too old to direct it.&quot; Columbus&#x27;s script was leaked onto the Internet in 1997, and many believed it was an early draft for the fourth film because it was mistakenly dated to 1995.

Dissatisfied, Spielberg suggested introducing Indiana&#x27;s father, Henry Jones, Sr. Lucas was dubious, believing the Grail should be the story&#x27;s focus, but Spielberg convinced him that the father–son relationship would serve as a great metaphor in Indiana&#x27;s search for the artifact. Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes, who had worked on Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;The Color Purple&quot; and &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;, to begin a new script on January 1, 1986. Meyjes completed his script ten months later. It depicted Indiana searching for his father in Montségur, where he meets a nun named Chantal. Indiana travels to Venice, takes the &quot;Orient Express&quot; to Istanbul, and continues by train to Petra, where he meets Sallah and reunites with his father. Together they find the grail. At the climax, a Nazi villain touches the Grail and explodes; when Henry touches it, he ascends a stairway to Heaven. Chantal chooses to stay on Earth because of her love for Indiana. In a revised draft dated two months later, Indiana finds his father in Krak des Chevaliers, the Nazi leader is a woman named Greta von Grimm, and Indiana battles a demon at the Grail site, which he defeats with a dagger inscribed with &quot;God is King&quot;. The prologue in both drafts has Indiana in Mexico battling for possession of Montezuma&#x27;s death mask with a man who owns gorillas as pets.
Spielberg suggested &quot;Innerspace&quot; writer Jeffrey Boam perform the next rewrite. Boam spent two weeks reworking the story with Lucas, which yielded a treatment that is largely similar to the final film. Boam told Lucas that Indiana should find his father in the middle of the story. &quot;Given the fact that it&#x27;s the third film in the series, you couldn&#x27;t just end with them obtaining the object. That&#x27;s how the first two films ended,&quot; he said, &quot;So I thought, let them &quot;lose&quot; the Grail, and let the father–son relationship be the main point. It&#x27;s an archaeological search for Indy&#x27;s own identity and coming to accept his father is more what it&#x27;s about [than the quest for the Grail].&quot; Boam said he felt there was not enough character development in the previous films. In Boam&#x27;s first draft, dated September 1987, the film is set in 1939. The prologue has adult Indiana retrieving an Aztec relic for a museum curator in Mexico and features the circus train. Henry and Elsa (who is described as having dark hair) were searching for the Grail on behalf of the Chandler Foundation, before Henry went missing. The character of Kazim is here named Kemal, and is an agent of the Republic of Hatay, which seeks the grail for its own. Kemal shoots Henry and dies drinking from the wrong chalice. The Grail Knight battles Indiana on horseback, while Vogel is crushed by a boulder while attempting to steal the Grail.
Boam&#x27;s February 23, 1988, rewrite used many of Connery&#x27;s comic suggestions. It included the prologue that was eventually filmed; because of the mixed response to &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;, which was about a young boy, Lucas had to convince Spielberg to show Indiana as a boy. Spielberg—who was later awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award—had the idea of making Indiana a Boy Scout. The 1912 prologue as seen in the film refers to events in the lives of Indiana&#x27;s creators. When Indiana cracks the bullwhip to defend himself against a lion, he accidentally lashes and scars his chin. Ford gained this scar in a car accident as a young man. Indiana taking his nickname from his pet Alaskan Malamute is a reference to the character being named after Lucas&#x27;s dog. The train carriage Indiana enters is named &quot;Doctor Fantasy&#x27;s Magic Caboose&quot;, which was the name producer Frank Marshall used when performing magic tricks. Spielberg suggested the idea, Marshall came up with the false-bottomed box through which Indiana escapes, and production designer Elliott Scott suggested the trick be done in a single, uninterrupted shot. Spielberg intended the shot of Henry with his umbrella—after he causes the bird strike on the German plane—to evoke &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Indiana&#x27;s mother, named Margaret in this version, dismisses Indiana when he returns home with the Cross of Coronado, while his father is on a long-distance call. Walter Chandler of the Chandler Foundation features, but is not the main villain; he plunges to his death in the tank. Elsa introduces Indiana and Brody to a large Venetian family that knows Henry. Leni Riefenstahl appears at the Nazi rally in Berlin. Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail. Kemal tries to blow up the Grail Temple during a comic fight in which gunpowder is repeatedly lit and extinguished. Elsa shoots Henry, then dies drinking from the wrong Grail, and Indiana rescues his father from falling into the chasm while grasping for the Grail. Boam&#x27;s revision of March 1 showed Henry causing the seagulls to strike the plane, and has Henry saving Indiana at the end.

During an undated &quot;Amblin&quot; revision and a rewrite by Tom Stoppard (under the pen name Barry Watson) dated May 8, 1988, further changes were made. Stoppard polished most of the dialogue, and created the &quot;Panama Hat&quot; character to link the prologue&#x27;s segments featuring the young and adult Indianas. The Venetian family is cut. Kemal is renamed Kazim and now wants to protect the grail rather than find it. Chandler is renamed Donovan. The scene of Brody being captured is added. Vogel now dies in the tank, while Donovan shoots Henry and then drinks from the false grail, and Elsa falls into the chasm. The Grail trials are expanded to include the stone-stepping and leap of faith.
===Filming===

Principal photography began on May 16, 1988, in the Tabernas Desert in Spain&#x27;s Almería province. Spielberg originally had planned the chase to be a short sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each other. He later said he had more fun storyboarding the sequence than filming it. The second unit had begun filming two weeks before. After approximately ten days, the production moved to the Escuela de Arte de Almería, to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay&#x27;s palace. Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park was used for the road, tunnel and beach sequence (at Playa de Mónsul) in which birds strike the plane. The shoot&#x27;s Spanish portion wrapped on June 2, 1988, in Guadix, Granada, with filming of Brody&#x27;s capture at Alexandretta train station. The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere, rather than adding it as a visual effect.
The exteriors of &quot;Brunwald Castle&quot; were filmed at Bürresheim Castle in West Germany. In the movie the image of the castle has been flipped and the building was expanded with a Matte painting depicting a copy of the right facade to the left of the main tower. Filming for the castle interiors took place in the United Kingdom from June 5 to 10, 1988, at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, England. On June 16, Lawrence Hall, London, was used as the interior of Berlin Tempelhof Airport. Filming returned to Elstree the next day to capture the motorcycle escape, continuing at the studio for interior scenes until July 18. One day was spent at North Weald Airfield on June 29 to film Indiana leaving for Venice. Ford and Connery acted much of the Zeppelin table conversation without trousers on because of the overheated set. Spielberg, Marshall and Kennedy interrupted the shoot to make a plea to the Parliament of the United Kingdom to support the economically &quot;depressed&quot; British studios. July 20–22 was spent filming the temple interiors. The temple set, which took six weeks to build, was supported on of hydraulics and ten gimbals for use during the earthquake scene. Resetting between takes took twenty minutes while the hydraulics were put to their starting positions and the cracks filled with plaster. The shot of the Grail falling to the temple floor—causing the first crack to appear—was attempted on the full-size set, but proved too difficult. Instead, crews built a separate floor section that incorporated a pre-scored crack sealed with plaster. It took several takes to throw the Grail from onto the right part of the crack. July 25–26 was spent on night shoots at Stowe School, Stowe, Buckinghamshire, for the Nazi rally.

Filming resumed two days later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences. The steamship fight in the prologue&#x27;s 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-forty-feet (eighteen-by-twelve-meter) deck built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanks – each holding three hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000 lb.; 1363 liters) of water – were used in the scene. Henry&#x27;s house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim&#x27;s fight in Venice in front of a ship&#x27;s propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they really were. Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of the camera in the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana&#x27;s college (as it had in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;).

Shooting in Venice took place on August 8. For scenes such as Indiana and Brody greeting Elsa, shots of the boat chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is, Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists for as long as possible. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned the camera to ensure no satellite dishes would be visible. San Barnaba di Venezia served as the library&#x27;s exterior. The next day, filming moved to the ancient city of Petra, Jordan, where Al Khazneh (The Treasury) stood in for the temple housing the Grail. The cast and crew became guests of King Hussein and Queen Noor. The Treasury had previously appeared in &quot;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&quot;. The main cast completed their scenes that week, after 63 days of filming.

The second unit filmed part of the prologue&#x27;s 1912 segment from August 29 to September 3. The main unit began two days later with the circus train sequence at Alamosa, Colorado, on the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. They filmed at Pagosa Springs on September 7, and then at Cortez on September 10. From September 14 to 16, filming of Indiana falling into the train carriages took place in Los Angeles. The production then moved to Utah&#x27;s Arches National Park to shoot more of the opening. A house in Antonito, Colorado was used for the Jones family home. The production had intended to film at Mesa Verde National Park, but Native American representatives had religious objections to its use. When Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn viewed a rough cut of the film in late 1988, they felt it suffered from a lack of action. The motorcycle chase was shot during post-production at Mount Tamalpais and Fairfax near Skywalker Ranch. The closing shot of Indiana, Henry, Sallah and Brody riding into the sunset was filmed in Amarillo, Texas in early 1989 by the second unit, directed by Frank Marshall. Filming ended on September 16, 1988 after 123 days of filming.

===Design===

Mechanical effects supervisor George Gibbs said the film was the most difficult one of his career. He visited a museum to negotiate renting a small French World War I tank, but decided he wanted to make one. The tank was based on the Tank Mark VIII, which was long and weighed . However, some liberties were taken with the design. Gibbs built the tank over the framework of a excavator and added tracks that were driven by two automatic hydraulic pumps, each connected to a Range Rover V8 engine. Gibbs built the tank from steel rather than aluminum or fiberglass because it would allow the realistically suspensionless vehicle to endure the rocky surfaces. Unlike its historic counterpart, which had only the two side guns, the tank had a turret gun added as well. It took four months to build and was transported to Almería on a Short Belfast plane and then a low loader truck.

The tank broke down twice. The distributor&#x27;s rotor arm broke and a replacement had to be sourced from Madrid. Then two of the device&#x27;s valves used to cool the oil exploded, due to solder melting and mixing with the oil. It was very hot in the tank, despite the installation of ten fans, and the lack of suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking during filming breaks. The tank only moved at , which Vic Armstrong said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making it appear faster. A smaller section of the tank&#x27;s top made from aluminum and which used rubber tracks was used for close-ups. It was built from a searchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive truck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off. A quarter-scale model by Gibbs was driven over a cliff on location; Industrial Light &amp; Magic created further shots of the tank&#x27;s destruction with models and miniatures.
Michael Lantieri, mechanical effects supervisor for the 1912 scenes, noted the difficulty in shooting the train sequence. &quot;You can&#x27;t just stop a train,&quot; he said, &quot;If it misses its mark, it takes blocks and blocks to stop it and back up.&quot; Lantieri hid handles for the actors and stuntmen to grab onto when leaping from carriage to carriage. The carriage interiors shot at Universal Studios Hollywood were built on tubes that inflated and deflated to create a rocking motion. For the close-up of the rhinoceros that strikes at (and misses) Indiana, a foam and fiberglass animatronic was made in London. When Spielberg decided he wanted it to move, the prop was sent to John Carl Buechler in Los Angeles, who resculpted it over three days to blink, snarl, snort and wiggle its ears. The giraffes were also created in London. Because steam locomotives are very loud, Lantieri&#x27;s crew would respond to first assistant director David Tomblin&#x27;s radioed directions by making the giraffes nod or shake their heads to his questions, which amused the crew. For the villains&#x27; cars, Lantieri selected a 1914 Ford Model T, a 1919 Ford Model T truck and a 1916 Saxon Model 14, fitting each with a Ford Pinto V6 engine. Sacks of dust were hung under the cars to create a dustier environment.
Spielberg used doves for the seagulls that Henry scares into striking the German plane because the real gulls used in the first take did not fly. In December 1988, Lucasfilm ordered 1,000 disease-free gray rats for the catacombs scenes from the company that supplied the snakes and bugs for the previous films. Within five months, 5,000 rats had been bred for the sequence; 1,000 mechanical rats stood in for those that were set on fire. Several thousand snakes of five breeds—including a boa constrictor—were used for the train scene, in addition to rubber ones onto which Phoenix could fall. The snakes would slither from their crates, requiring the crew to dig through sawdust after filming to find and return them. Two lions were used, which became nervous because of the rocking motion and flickering lights.

Costume designer Anthony Powell found it a challenge to create Connery&#x27;s costume because the script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout. Powell thought about his own grandfather and incorporated tweed suits and fishing hats. Powell felt it necessary for Henry to wear glasses, but did not want to hide Connery&#x27;s eyes, so chose rimless ones. He could not find any suitable, so he had them specially made. The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in Eastern Europe by Powell&#x27;s co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave research pictures and drawings for reference.
The motorcycles used in the chase from the castle were a mixed bag: the scout model with sidecar in which Indy and Henry escape was an original Dnepr, complete with machine gun pintle on the sidecar, while the pursuing vehicles were more modern machines dressed up with equipment and logos to make them resemble German army models.
Gibbs used two Swiss Pilatus P-2 air force training planes standing in as pursuing Luftwaffe Arado Ar 96s for the Zeppelin biplane escape sequence. He built a device based on an internal combustion engine to simulate gunfire, which was safer and less expensive than firing blanks. Baking soda was applied to Connery to create Henry&#x27;s bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect as the water from the Grail washes it away.
At least one reproduction Kübelwagen was used during filming despite the film being set two years prior to manufacture of said vehicles.

===Effects===
Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) built an foam model of the Zeppelin to complement shots of Ford and Connery climbing into the Gotha Go 145C biplane. A biplane model with a wingspan was used for the shot of the biplane detaching. Stop motion animation was used for the shot of the German fighter&#x27;s wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a model that occupied 14 of ILM&#x27;s parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against bluescreen; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was removed and later composited into the shot. Dust and shadows were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it appear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred tim-birds were used in the background shots of the seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped feather-coated crosses onto the camera. These only looked convincing because the scene&#x27;s quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls. ILM&#x27;s Wes Takahashi supervised the film&#x27;s effects sequences.
Spielberg devised the three trials that guard the Grail. For the first, the blades under which Indiana ducks like a penitent man were a mix of practical and miniature blades created by Gibbs and ILM. For the second trial, in which Indiana spells &quot;Iehova&quot; on stable stepping stones, it was intended to have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on &quot;J&quot;. This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor, above a cavern. As this was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production. The third trial, the leap of faith that Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden by forced perspective, was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds. This was cheaper than building a full-size set. A puppet of Ford was used to create a shadow on the by model because Ford had filmed the scene against bluescreen, which did not incorporate the shaft of light from the entrance.

Spielberg wanted Donovan&#x27;s death shown in one shot, so it would not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover&#x27;s forehead and cheeks by Nick Dudman that made his eyes seem to recede during the character&#x27;s initial decomposition, as well as a mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan&#x27;s death was the first all-digital composite scene in a movie, and was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan created by Stephan Dupuis in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on &quot;Willow&quot; (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet&#x27;s torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody&#x27;s double had not been filmed for the scene&#x27;s latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan&#x27;s skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.

Ben Burtt designed the sound effects. He recorded chickens for the sounds of the rats, and digitally manipulated the noise made by a Styrofoam cup for the castle fire. He rode in a biplane to record the sounds for the dogfight sequence, and visited the demolition of a wind turbine for the plane crashes. Burtt wanted an echoing gunshot for Donovan wounding Henry, so he fired a .357 Magnum in Skywalker Ranch&#x27;s underground car park, just as Lucas drove in. A rubber balloon was used for the earthquake tremors at the temple. The film was released in selected theaters in the 70 mm Full-Field Sound format, which allowed sounds to not only move from side to side, but also from the theater&#x27;s front to its rear.

Matte paintings of the Austrian castle and the Berlin airport were based on real buildings; the Austrian castle &quot;Schloss Brunwald&quot; is Bürresheim Castle near Mayen in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, that was made to look larger. Rain was created by filming granulated Borax soap against black at high speed. It was only lightly double exposed into the shots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The Administration Building at San Francisco&#x27;s Treasure Island was used as the exterior of Berlin Tempelhof Airport. The structure already had period-appropriate art deco architecture, as it had been constructed in 1938 for planned use as an airport terminal. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage automobiles and a sign stating &quot;Berlin Flughafen&quot;. The establishing shot of the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were backlit and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings were used for the sky and to give the appearance of fill light in the shadows and rim light on the edges of the buildings.

==Themes==
A son&#x27;s relationship with his estranged father is a common theme in Spielberg&#x27;s films, including &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; and &quot;Hook&quot;. 

The film&#x27;s exploration of fathers and sons coupled with its use of religious imagery is comparable to two other 1989 films, &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; and &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James felt the combination in these films reflected New Age concerns, where the worship of God was equated to searching for fathers. James felt that neither Indiana nor his father is preoccupied with finding the Grail or defeating the Nazis, but that, rather, both seek professional respect for one another in their boys&#x27; own adventure. James contrasted the temple&#x27;s biblically epic destruction with the more effective and quiet conversation between the Joneses at the film&#x27;s end. James noted that Indiana&#x27;s mother does not appear in the prologue, being portrayed as already having died before the film&#x27;s events began.
==Release==

===Marketing===

The film&#x27;s teaser trailer debuted in November 1988 with &quot;Scrooged&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;. Rob MacGregor wrote the tie-in novelization that was released in June 1989; it sold enough copies to be included on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. MacGregor went on to write the first six &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; prequel novels during the 1990s. Following the film&#x27;s release, Ford donated Indiana&#x27;s fedora and jacket to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History.

No toys were made to promote the film; Indiana Jones &quot;never happened on the toy level&quot;, said Larry Carlat, senior editor of the journal &quot;Children&#x27;s Business&quot;. Rather, Lucasfilm promoted Indiana as a lifestyle symbol, selling tie-in fedoras, shirts, jackets and watches. Two video games based on the film were released by LucasArts in 1989: &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game&quot;. A third game was produced by Taito and released in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Ryder Windham wrote another novelization, released in April 2008 by Scholastic, to coincide with the release of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;. Hasbro released toys based on &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; in July 2008.

===Box office===
The film was released in the United States and Canada on Wednesday, May 24, 1989, in 2,327 theaters, earning a record $37,031,573 over the 4-day Memorial Day weekend. The gross was boosted by high ticket prices in some venues ($7 a ticket). Its 3-day opening weekend figure of $29,355,021 was surpassed later that year by &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;, which grossed more in its opening 3 days than &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; in 4. The film would hold the record for having the highest Memorial Day weekend gross until 1994 when &quot;The Flintstones&quot; took it. Additionally, it had the largest opening weekend for a Harrison Ford film for eight years until &quot;Air Force One&quot; surpassed it in 1997. Its Saturday gross of $11,181,429 was the first time a film had made over $10 million in one day. It broke the record for the best seven-day performance with a gross of $50.2 million, beating the $45.7 million grossed by &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; in 1984 on 1,687 screens. It added another record with $77 million after twelve days, and earned $100 million in a record nineteen days. In France, the film broke a record by selling a million admissions within two and a half weeks. In the United Kingdom, it opened in three London theaters before opening two days later on 361 screens nationally, setting an opening weekend record of £1,811,542 ($2,862,200), breaking the one set the year before by &quot;Crocodile Dundee II&quot;. It spent six weeks at number one in the United Kingdom.

The film eventually grossed $197.1 million in the United States and Canada and $277 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $474.2 million. At the time of its release, the film was the 11th highest-grossing film of all time. Despite competition from &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; became the highest-grossing film worldwide in 1989. In North America, &quot;Batman&quot; took top position. Behind &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; and &quot;Raiders&quot;, &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; is the third-highest grossing Indiana Jones film in the United States and Canada, though it is also behind &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; when adjusting for inflation. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 49 million tickets in North America. The film was re-released in 1992 earning $139,000.

===Home media===
The film was released along with its two predecessors as part of a trilogy DVD box set in 2003. It contained extra materials and a special documentary covering the production of the films. Sales figures for the box set were extremely successful and 600,000 copies were sold in the US on the first day of release. In 2012, the film was released on Blu-ray along with the three other films in the Indiana Jones film series at the time. In 2021, a remastered 4K version of the film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, produced using scans of the original negatives. It was released as part of a box set for the then four films in the Indiana Jones film series.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Lighter and more comedic than its predecessor, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; returns the series to the brisk serial adventure of &quot;Raiders&quot;, while adding a dynamite double act between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.&quot; Metacritic calculated a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.
Jay Boyar of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said that while the film &quot;lacks the novelty of &quot;Raiders&quot;, and the breathless pacing of &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;, it was an entertaining capper to the trilogy.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked the film was &quot;the wildest and wittiest Indy of them all&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; and David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; praised it, as did Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Though it seems to have the manner of some magically reconstituted B-movie of an earlier era, &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; is an endearing original,&quot; Canby wrote, calling the revelation that Jones had a father who was not proud of him to be a &quot;comic surprise&quot;. Canby believed that while the film did not match the previous two in its pacing, it still had &quot;hilariously off-the-wall sequences&quot; such as the circus train chase. He also said that Spielberg was maturing by focusing on the father–son relationship, a call echoed by McBride in &quot;Variety&quot;. Roger Ebert praised the sequence depicting Jones as a Boy Scout with the Cross of Coronado, comparing it to the &quot;style of illustration that appeared in the boys&#x27; adventure magazines of the 1940s&quot;. He said that Spielberg &quot;must have been paging through his old issues of &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; magazine...the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop. Spielberg lights the scene in the strong, basic colors of old pulp magazines.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; felt Connery and Ford deserved Academy Award nominations.

It was panned by Andrew Sarris in &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, David Denby in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Stanley Kauffmann in &quot;The New Republic&quot; and Georgia Brown in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called the film &quot;soulless&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reviewed the film twice; Hal Hinson&#x27;s review on the day of the film&#x27;s release was negative, describing it as &quot;nearly all chases and dull exposition&quot;. Although he praised Ford and Connery, he felt the film&#x27;s exploration of Jones&#x27;s character took away his mystery and that Spielberg should not have tried to mature his storytelling. Two days later, Desson Thomson published a positive review praising the film&#x27;s adventure and action, as well as the father–son relationship&#x27;s thematic depth.

===Influence===
The film won the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing; it also received nominations for Best Original Score and Best Sound (Ben Burtt, Gary Summers, Shawn Murphy and Tony Dawe), but lost to &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Glory&quot; respectively. Connery received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Connery and the visual and sound effects teams were also nominated at the 43rd British Academy Film Awards. The film won the 1990 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and was nominated for Best Motion Picture Drama at the Young Artist Awards. John Williams&#x27;s score won a Broadcast Music Incorporated Award, and was nominated for a Grammy Award.
The prologue depicting Jones in his youth inspired Lucas to create &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; television series, which featured Sean Patrick Flanery as the young adult Indiana and Corey Carrier as the 8- to 10-year-old Indiana. According to Dark Horse Comics author Lee Marrs, Lucasfilm considered for a while to make a continuation to the film series starring Phoenix as a younger Jones, but these plans were dropped after his untimely death. The 13-year-old incarnation played by Phoenix in the film was the focus of a &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot; series of young adult novels that began in 1990; by the ninth novel, the series had become a tie-in to the television show. German author Wolfgang Hohlbein revisited the prologue in one of his novels, in which Jones encounters the lead grave robber—whom Hohlbein christens Jake—in 1943. The film&#x27;s ending begins the 1995 comic series &quot;Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny&quot;, which moves forward to depict Jones and his father searching for the Holy Lance in Ireland in 1945. Spielberg intended to have Connery cameo as Henry in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008), but Connery turned it down as he had retired.

Petra&#x27;s use for the movie&#x27;s climactic scenes greatly contributed to its popularity as an international tourist destination. Before the film&#x27;s release, only a few thousand visitors per year made the trip; since then it has grown to almost a million annually. Shops and hotels near the site play up the connection, and it is mentioned prominently in itineraries of locations used in the film series. Jordan&#x27;s tourism board mentions the connection on its website. In 2012, the satirical news site The Pan-Arabia Enquirer ran a mock story claiming that the board had officially renamed Petra &quot;That Place from &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;&quot; to reflect how the world more commonly refers to it.

<text>Textile is an umbrella term that includes various fiber-based materials, including fibers, yarns, filaments, threads, different fabric types, etc. At first, the word &quot;textiles&quot; only referred to woven fabrics. However, weaving is not the only manufacturing method, and many other methods were later developed to form textile structures based on their intended use. Knitting and non-woven are other popular types of fabric manufacturing. In the contemporary world, textiles satisfy the material needs for versatile applications, from simple daily clothing to bulletproof jackets, spacesuits, and doctor&#x27;s gowns.

Textiles are divided into two groups: consumer textiles for domestic purposes and technical textiles. In consumer textiles, aesthetics and comfort are the most important factors, while in technical textiles, functional properties are the priority. The durability of textiles is an important property, with common cotton or blend garments (such as t-shirts) able to last twenty years or more with regular use and care.

Geotextiles, industrial textiles, medical textiles, and many other areas are examples of technical textiles, whereas clothing and furnishings are examples of consumer textiles. Each component of a textile product, including fiber, yarn, fabric, processing, and finishing, affects the final product. Components may vary among various textile products as they are selected based on their fitness for purpose.

Fiber is the smallest fabric component; they are typically spun into yarn, and yarns are used to manufacture fabrics. Fiber has a hair-like appearance and a higher length-to-width ratio. The sources of fibers may be natural, synthetic, or both. The techniques of felting and bonding directly transform fibers into fabric. In other cases, yarns are manipulated with different fabric manufacturing systems to produce various fabric constructions. The fibers are twisted or laid out to make a long, continuous strand of yarn. Yarns are then used to make different kinds of fabric by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, tatting, or braiding. After manufacturing, textile materials are processed and finished to add value, such as aesthetics, physical characteristics, and increased usefulness. The manufacturing of textiles is the oldest industrial art. Dyeing, printing, and embroidery are all different decorative arts applied to textile materials.

==Etymology==

=== Textile ===
The word &#x27;textile&#x27; comes from the Latin adjective , meaning &#x27;woven&#x27;, which itself stems from , the past participle of the verb , &#x27;to weave&#x27;. Originally applied to woven fabrics, the term &quot;textiles&quot; is now used to encompass a diverse range of materials, including fibers, yarns, and fabrics, as well as other related items.

=== Fabric ===

A &quot;fabric&quot; is defined as any thin, flexible material made from yarn, directly from fibers, polymeric film, foam, or any combination of these techniques. Fabric has a broader application than cloth. Fabric is synonymous with cloth, material, goods, or piece goods. The word &#x27;fabric&#x27; also derives from Latin, with roots in the Proto-Indo-European language. Stemming most recently from the Middle French , or &quot;building,&quot; and earlier from the Latin (&#x27;workshop; an art, trade; a skillful production, structure, fabric&#x27;), the noun stems from the Latin &quot; artisan who works in hard materials&#x27;, which itself is derived from the Proto-Indo-European &quot;dhabh-&quot;, meaning &#x27;to fit together&#x27;.

=== Cloth ===
Cloth is a flexible substance typically created through the processes of weaving, felting, or knitting using natural or synthetic materials. The word &#x27;cloth&#x27; derives from the Old English , meaning &quot;a cloth, woven, or felted material to wrap around one&#x27;s body&#x27;, from the Proto-Germanic , similar to the Old Frisian , the Middle Dutch , the Middle High German and the German , all meaning &#x27;garment&#x27;.

Although cloth is a type of fabric, not all fabrics can be classified as cloth due to differences in their manufacturing processes, physical properties, and intended uses. Materials that are woven, knitted, tufted, or knotted from yarns are referred to as cloth, while wallpaper, plastic upholstery products, carpets, and nonwoven materials are examples of fabrics.

== History ==
Textiles themselves are too fragile to survive across millennia; the tools used for spinning and weaving make up most of the prehistoric evidence for textile work. The earliest tool for spinning was the spindle, to which a whorl was eventually added. The weight of the whorl improved the thickness and twist of the spun thread. Later, the spinning wheel was invented. Historians are unsure where; some say China, others India.

The precursors of today&#x27;s textiles include leaves, barks, fur pelts, and felted cloths.

The Banton Burial Cloth, the oldest existing example of warp ikat in Southeast Asia, is displayed at the National Museum of the Philippines. The cloth was most likely made by the native Asian people of northwest Romblon.
The first clothes, worn at least 70,000 years ago and perhaps much earlier, were probably made of animal skins and helped protect early humans from the elements. At some point, people learned to weave plant fibers into textiles.
The discovery of dyed flax fibers in a cave in the Republic of Georgia dated to 34,000 BCE suggests that textile-like materials were made as early as the Paleolithic era.

The speed and scale of textile production have been altered almost beyond recognition by industrialization and the introduction of modern manufacturing techniques.

=== Textile industry ===

The textile industry grew out of art and craft and was kept going by guilds. In the 18th and 19th centuries, during the Industrial Revolution, it became increasingly mechanized. In 1765, when a machine for spinning wool or cotton called the spinning jenny was invented in the United Kingdom, textile production became the first economic activity to be industrialised. In the 20th century, science and technology were driving forces.
The textile industry exhibits inherent dynamism, influenced by a multitude of transformative changes and innovations within the domain. Textile operations can experience ramifications arising from shifts in international trade policies, evolving fashion trends, evolving customer preferences, variations in production costs and methodologies, adherence to safety and environmental regulations, as well as advancements in research and development.

The textile and garment industries exert a significant impact on the economic systems of numerous countries engaged in textile production.

=== Naming ===

Most textiles were called by their base fibre generic names, their place of origin, or were put into groups based loosely on manufacturing techniques, characteristics, and designs. Nylon, olefin, and acrylic are generic names for some of the more commonly used synthetic fibres.

=== Related terms ===
The related words &quot;fabric&quot; and &quot;cloth&quot; and &quot;material&quot; are often used in textile assembly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking) as synonyms for &quot;textile&quot;. However, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage. &quot;Material&quot; is an extremely broad term basically meaning consisting of matter, and requires context to be useful. A textile is any material made of interlacing fibers, including carpeting and geotextiles, which may not necessarily be used in the production of further goods, such as clothing and upholstery. A &quot;fabric&quot; is a material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, felting, stitching, crocheting or bonding that may be used in the production of further products, such as clothing and upholstery, thus requiring a further step of the production. &quot;Cloth&quot; may also be used synonymously with &quot;fabric&quot;, but often specifically refers to a piece of fabric that has been processed or cut.
* Greige goods: Textiles that are raw and unfinished are referred to as greige goods. After manufacturing, the materials are processed and finished.
* Piece goods: Piece goods were textile materials sold in cut pieces as specified by the buyer. Piece goods were either cut from a fabric roll or made to a specific length, also known as yard goods.

== Types ==

Textiles are various materials made from fibers and yarns. The term &quot;textile&quot; was originally only used to refer to woven fabrics, but today it covers a broad range of subjects. Textiles are classified at various levels, such as according to fiber origin (natural or synthetic), structure (woven, knitted, nonwoven), finish, etc. However, there are primarily two types of textiles:

=== Consumer textiles ===
Textiles have an assortment of uses, the most common of which are for clothing and for containers such as bags and baskets. In the household, textiles are used in carpeting, upholstered furnishings, window shades, towels, coverings for tables, beds, and other flat surfaces, and in art. Textiles are used in many traditional hand crafts such as sewing, quilting, and embroidery.

=== Technical textiles ===

Textiles produced for industrial purposes, and designed and chosen for technical characteristics beyond their appearance, are commonly referred to as &quot;technical textiles.&quot; Technical textiles include textile structures for automotive applications, medical textiles (such as implants), geotextile (reinforcement of embankments), agrotextiles (textiles for crop protection), protective clothing (such as clothing resistant to heat and radiation for fire fighter clothing, against molten metals for welders, stab protection, and bullet proof vests).

In the workplace, textiles can be used in industrial and scientific processes such as filtering. Miscellaneous uses include flags, backpacks, tents, nets, cleaning , transportation devices such as balloons, kites, sails, and parachutes; textiles are also used to provide strengthening in composite materials such as fibreglass and industrial geotextiles.

Due to the often highly technical and legal requirements of these products, these textiles are typically tested to ensure they meet stringent performance requirements. Other forms of technical textiles may be produced to experiment with their scientific qualities and to explore the possible benefits they may have in the future. Threads coated with zinc oxide nanowires, when woven into fabric, have been shown capable of &quot;self-powering nanosystems&quot;, using vibrations created by everyday actions like wind or body movements to generate energy.

== Significance ==
Textiles are all around us. The textile is a component of basic needs like food and shelter. Textiles are everywhere in our lives, from bath towels to space suits. Textiles help humans by comforting, protecting, and extending their lives. Textiles meet our clothing needs, keeping us warm in the winter and cool in the summer. There are several applications for textiles, such as medical textiles, intelligent textiles, and automotive textiles. All of them contribute to the well-being of humans.

=== Serviceability in textiles ===

The term &quot;serviceability&quot; refers to a textile product&#x27;s ability to meet the needs of consumers. The emphasis is on knowing the target market and matching the needs of the target market to the product&#x27;s serviceability. Serviceability or performance in textiles is the ability of textile materials to withstand various conditions, environments, and hazards. Aesthetics, durability, comfort and safety, appearance retention, care, environmental impact, and cost are the serviceability concepts employed in structuring the material.

=== Components ===
Fibers, yarns, fabric construction, finishes and design are components of a textile product. The selection of specific components varies with the intended use, therefore the fibers, yarns, and fabric manufacturing systems are selected with consideration of the required performance.

== Use and applications ==
=== Other uses ===
Textiles, textile production, and clothing were necessities of life in prehistory, intertwined with the social, economic, and religious systems. Other than clothing, textile crafts produced utilitarian, symbolic, and opulent items. Archaeological artifacts from the Stone Age and the Iron Age in Central Europe are used to examine prehistoric clothing and its role in forming individual and group identities.

==== Source of knowledge ====
Artifacts unearthed in various archaeological excavations informs us about the remains of past human life and their activities. Dyed flax fibers discovered in the Republic of Georgia indicate that textile-like materials were developed during the Paleolithic period. Radiocarbon dates the microscopic fibers to 36,000 years ago, when modern humans migrated from Africa.

Several textile remnants, such as the Inca Empire&#x27;s textile arts remnants, which embody the Incas&#x27; aesthetics and social ideals, serve as a means for disseminating information about numerous civilizations, customs, and cultures.

There are textile museums that display history related to many aspects of textiles. A textile museum raises public awareness and appreciation of the artistic merits and cultural significance of the world&#x27;s textiles on a local, national, and international scale. The George Washington University Museum and Textile Museum in Washington, D.C., was established in 1925.

==== Narrative art ====
The Bayeux Tapestry is a rare example of secular Romanesque art. The art work depicts the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.

==== Decorative art ====

Textiles are also used for decorative art. Appliqué work of pipili is decorative art of Odisha, a state in eastern India, used for umbrellas, wall hangings, lamp shades, and bags. To make a range of decorative products, colored cloth in the shapes of animals, birds, flowers, are sewn onto a base cloth.
==== Architextiles ====
Architextiles, a combination of the words architecture and textile, are textile-based assemblages. Awnings are a basic type of architectural textile. Mughal Shahi Lal Dera Tent, which was a movable palace, is an example of the architextiles of the Mughal period.

====Currency====
Textiles had been used as currency as well. In Africa, textiles were used as currency in addition to being used for clothing, headwear, swaddling, tents, sails, bags, sacks, carpets, rugs, curtains, etc. Along the east–west axis in sub-Saharan Africa, cloth strip, which was typically produced in the savannah, was used as a form of currency.

==== Votive offering ====
Textiles were among the objects offered to the gods [votive offering] in ancient Greece for religious purposes.

==Fiber==

The smallest component of a fabric is fiber; fibers are typically spun into yarn, and yarns are used to make fabrics. Fibers are very thin and hair-like structures. The sources of fibers may be natural, synthetic, or both.

=== Global consumption ===
Global fiber production per person has increased from 8.4 kilograms in 1975 to 14.3 kilograms in 2021. After a modest drop due to COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, global fiber output rebounded to 113 million tons in 2021. Global fiber output roughly doubled from 58 million tons in 2000 to 113 million tons in 2021 and is anticipated to reach 149 million tons in 2030.

The demand for synthetic fibers is increasing rapidly. This has numerous causes. Reasons include its low price, the demand-supply imbalance of cotton, and its [Synthetic fibers&#x27;] versatility in design and application. Synthetic fibers accounts for 70% of global fiber use, mainly polyester. By 2030, the synthetic fiber market will reach 98.21 billion US dollars. From 2022 to 2030, the market is anticipated to increase by 5.1% per year.

=== Fiber sources ===
* Natural fibers are obtained from plants, animals and minerals. Since prehistoric times, textiles have been made from natural fibers. Natural fibers are further categorized as cellulosic, protein, and mineral.
* Synthetic or manmade fibers are manufactured with chemical synthesis.
* Semi-synthetic: A subset of synthetic or manmade fibers is semi-synthetic fiber. Rayon is a classified as a semi-synthetic fiber, made with natural polymers.
Monomers are the building blocks of polymers. Polymers in fibers are of two types: additive or condensation. Natural fibers, such as cotton and wool, have a condensation polymer type, whereas synthetic fibers can have either an additive or a condensation polymer type. For example, acrylic fiber and olefin fibers have additive polymers, and nylon and polyester are condensation polymers.

=== Types ===
=== Fiber properties ===
Fiber properties influence textile characteristics such as aesthetics, durability, comfort, and cost.
Fineness is one of the important characteristics of the fibers. They have a greater length-to-width ratio [100 times the diameter]. Fibers need to be strong, cohesive, and flexible. The usefulness of fibers are characterized on the basis of certain parameters such as strength, flexibility, and length to diameter ratio, and spinnability. Natural fibers are relatively short staple] in length. Synthetic fibers are produced in longer lengths called filaments. Silk is the only natural fiber that is a filament. The classification of fibers is based on their origin, derivation, and generic types.

Certain properties of synthetic fibers, such as their diameter, cross section, and color, can be altered during production.

Cotton: Cotton has a long history of use in the clothing due to its favorable properties. This fiber is soft, moisture-absorbent, breathable, and is renowned for its long durability.

==== Blends (blended textiles) ====
Fabric or yarn produced with a combination of two or more types of different fibers, or yarns to obtain desired traits. Blending is possible at various stages of textile manufacturing. Final composition is liable for the properties of the resultant product. Natural and synthetic fibers are blended to overcome disadvantage of single fiber properties and to achieve better performance characteristics and aesthetic effects such as devoré, heather effect, cross dyeing and stripes pattern etc. Clothing woven from a blend of cotton and polyester can be more durable and easier to maintain than material woven solely from cotton. Other than sharing functional properties, blending makes the products more economical.

Union or Union fabrics is the 19th century term for blended fabrics. While it is no longer in use. &quot;Mixture&quot; or &quot;mixed cloth&quot; is another term used for blended cloths when different types of yarns are used in warp and weft sides.

Blended textiles are not new.
* Mashru was a 16th-century fabric, is one of the earliest forms of &quot;mixed cloth&quot;, a material composed of silk and cotton.
* Siamoise was a 17th-century cotton and linen material.

==== Composition ====
Fiber composition the fiber blend composition of mixtures of the fibers, is an important criterion to analyze the behavior, properties such as functional aspects, and commercial classification of the merchandise.

The most common blend is cotton and polyester. Regular blended fabric is 65% polyester and 35% cotton. It is called a &quot;reverse blend&quot; if the ratio of cotton predominates—the percentage of the fibers changes with the price and required properties.

Blending adds value to the textiles; it helps in reducing the cost (artificial fibers are less expensive than natural fibers) and adding advantage in properties of the final product. For instance, a small amount of spandex adds stretch to the fabrics. Wool can add warmth.

== Uses of different fibers ==

=== Natural fibers ===

====Plant====

* Grass, rush, hemp, and sisal are all used in making rope. In the first two, the entire plant is used for this purpose, while in the last two, only fibers from the plant are used. Coir (coconut fiber) is used in making twine, and also in floormats, doormats, brushes, mattresses, floor tiles, and sacking.
* Straw and bamboo are both used to make hats. Straw, a dried form of grass, is also used for stuffing, as is kapok.
* Fibers from pulpwood trees, cotton, rice, hemp, and nettle are used in making paper.
* Cotton, flax, jute, hemp, modal, banana, bamboo, lotus, eucalyptus, mulberry, and sugarcane are all used in clothing. Piña (pineapple fiber) and ramie are also fibers used in clothing, generally with a blend of other fibers such as cotton. Nettles have also been used to make a fiber and fabric very similar to hemp or flax. The use of milkweed stalk fiber has also been reported, but it tends to be somewhat weaker than other fibers like hemp or flax.
* The inner bark of the lacebark tree is a fine netting that has been used to make clothing and accessories as well as utilitarian articles such as rope.
* Acetate is used to increase the shininess of certain fabrics such as silks, velvets, and taffetas.
* Seaweed is used in the production of textiles: a water-soluble fiber known as alginate is produced and is used as a holding fiber; when the cloth is finished, the alginate is dissolved, leaving an open area.
* Rayon is a manufactured fiber derived from plant pulp. Different types of rayon can imitate feel and texture of silk, cotton, wool, or linen.

Fibers from the stalks of plants, such as hemp, flax, and nettles, are also known as &#x27;bast&#x27; fibers. Hemp fiber is yellowish-brown fiber made from the hemp plant. The fiber characteristics are coarser, harsher, strong and lightweight. Hemp fiber is used primary to make twine, rope and cordage.

====Animal====
Animal textiles are commonly made from hair, fur, skin, or silk (in the case of silkworms).
* Wool refers to the hair of the domestic sheep or goat, which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped, and the wool as a whole is coated with a wax mixture known as lanolin (sometimes called wool grease), which is waterproof and dirtproof. The lanolin and other contaminants are removed from the raw wool before further processing. Woolen refers to a yarn produced from carded, non-parallel fibre, while worsted refers to a finer yarn spun from longer fibers which have been combed to be parallel.
** Other animal textiles which are made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, vicuña wool, llama wool, chiengora, shatoosh, yak fiber and camel hair, generally used in the production of coats, jackets, ponchos, blankets, and other warm coverings.
** &quot;Cashmere&quot;, the hair of the Indian cashmere goat, and mohair, the hair of the North African angora goat, are types of wool known for their softness. Pashmina is a type of very fine cashmere wool. Used in the production of sweaters and scarfs.
** &quot;Angora&quot; refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the angora rabbit. Qiviut is the fine inner wool of the muskox.
* Silk is an animal textile made from the fibres of the cocoon of the Chinese silkworm which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness. There are two main types of the silk: &#x27;mulberry silk&#x27; produced by the &quot;Bombyx mori&quot;, and &#x27;wild silk&#x27; such as Tussah silk (wild silk). Silkworm larvae produce the first type if cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption, while Tussah silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves. Around four-fifths of the world&#x27;s silk production consists of cultivated silk. Silk products include pillow covers, dresses, tops, skirts, bed sheets, curtains.

====Microbes====
Bacterial cellulose can be made from industrial organic and agricultural waste, and used as material for textiles and clothing.

====Mineral====
* Asbestos and basalt fibre are used for vinyl tiles, sheeting and adhesives, &quot;transite&quot; panels and siding, acoustical ceilings, stage curtains, and fire blankets.
* Glass fibre is used in the production of ironing board and mattress covers, ropes and cables, reinforcement fibre for composite materials, insect netting, flame-retardant and protective fabric, soundproof, fireproof, and insulating fibres. Glass fibres are woven and coated with Teflon to produce beta cloth, a virtually fireproof fabric which replaced nylon in the outer layer of United States space suits since 1968.
* Metal fibre, metal foil, and metal wire have a variety of uses, including the production of cloth-of-gold and jewellery. Hardware cloth (US term only) is a coarse woven mesh of steel wire, used in construction. It is much like standard window screening, but heavier and with a more open weave.

Minerals and natural and synthetic fabrics may be combined, as in emery cloth, a layer of emery abrasive glued to a cloth backing. Also, &quot;sand cloth&quot; is a US term for fine wire mesh with abrasive glued to it, employed like emery cloth or coarse sandpaper.

=== Synthetic ===

In the 20th century, they were supplemented by artificial fibers made from petroleum. Textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability, from the finest microfibre made of strands thinner than one denier to the sturdiest canvas.

Synthetic textiles are used primarily in the production of clothing, as well as the manufacture of geotextiles. Synthetic fibers are those that are constructed by humans through chemical synthesis.
* Polyester fibre is used in all types of clothing, either alone or blended with fibres such as cotton.
* Aramid fibre (e.g. Twaron) is used for flame-retardant clothing, cut-protection, and armour.
* Acrylic is a fibre used to imitate wools, including cashmere, and is often used in replacement of them.
* Nylon is a fibre used to imitate silk; it is used in the production of pantyhose. Thicker nylon fibres are used in rope and outdoor clothing.
* Spandex (trade name &quot;Lycra&quot;) is a polyurethane product that can be made tight-fitting without impeding movement. It is used to make activewear, bras, and swimsuits.
* Olefin fibre is a fibre used in activewear, linings, and warm clothing. Olefins are hydrophobic, allowing them to dry quickly. A sintered felt of olefin fibres is sold under the trade name Tyvek.
* Ingeo is a polylactide fibre blended with other fibres such as cotton and used in clothing. It is more hydrophilic than most other synthetics, allowing it to wick away perspiration.
* Lurex is a metallic fibre used in clothing embellishment.
* Milk proteins have also been used to create synthetic fabric. Milk or casein fibre cloth was developed during World War I in Germany, and further developed in Italy and America during the 1930s. Milk fibre fabric is not very durable and wrinkles easily, but has a pH similar to human skin and possesses anti-bacterial properties. It is marketed as a biodegradable, renewable synthetic fibre.
* Carbon fibre is mostly used in composite materials, together with resin, such as carbon fibre reinforced plastic. The fibres are made from polymer fibres through carbonization.

== Production methods ==

Textile manufacturing has progressed from prehistoric crafts to a fully automated industry. Over the years, there have been continuous improvements in fabric structure and design.

Important parameters in fabric selection:

The primary consideration in fabric selection is the end use. The fabric needs vary greatly depending on the application. Similar types of fabric may not be suitable for all applications.

Fabric weight is an important criteria while producing different fabrics. A carpet requires a fabric with 1300 GSM, but a robe may be made with 160 GSM. Certainly, fabrics for clothes and carpets have distinct weights.

Stretchable fabrics have greater movability and are thus more comfortable than fabrics with no stretch or less stretch.

=== Textile exports ===

According to the UN Commodity Trade Statistics Database, the global textiles and apparel export market reached $772 billion in 2013.

==== Changing dynamics of the market ====
China is the largest exporter of textile goods. Most of China&#x27;s exports consist of apparel, apparel accessories, textile yarns, and textile products. The competitive advantages of the China are low prices and abundant labor, lowered commercial obstacles, and a ready supply of raw materials. China, along with the United States and India, is a major producer of cotton.

China&#x27;s apparel market share has declined in recent years due to various reasons and a shift toward high-end, sophisticated products. Additionally, the investors from China made stakes in Myanmar, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Last year, its market share was 36.7%, or $161 billion, a decline of 8% year-over-year. In other words, China lost $14 billion in garment work orders to other countries in a single year. In 2016, Bangladesh&#x27;s apparel market share was valued at $28 billion, increasing 7.69 percent from the previous year.

In 2016 the leading exporters of apparel were China ($161 billion), Bangladesh ($28 billion), Vietnam ($25 billion), India ($18 billion), Hong Kong ($16 billion), Turkey ($15 billion), and Indonesia ($7 billion).

Garment exports from Bangladesh reached record high in the 2021–2022 fiscal year; China ($220,302 billion), Bangladesh ($38.70 billion), India ($8.127 billion), Pakistan ($19.33 billion).

== Finishing ==

The fabric, when it leaves a loom or knitting machine, is not readily usable. It may be rough, uneven, or have flaws like skewing. Hence, it is necessary to finish the fabric. Finishing techniques enhance the value of the treated fabrics. After manufacturing, textiles undergo a range of finishing procedures, including bleaching, dyeing, printing, as well as mechanical and chemical finishing.

=== Coloration ===
Textiles are often dyed, with fabrics available in almost every colour. The dyeing process often requires several dozen gallons of water for each pound of clothing. Coloured designs in textiles can be created by weaving together fibres of different colours (tartan or Uzbek Ikat), adding coloured stitches to finished fabric (embroidery), creating patterns by resist dyeing methods, tying off areas of cloth and dyeing the rest (tie-dyeing), drawing wax designs on cloth and dyeing in between them (batik), or using various printing processes on finished fabric. Woodblock printing, still used in India and elsewhere today, is the oldest of these dating back to at least 220 CE in China. Textiles are also sometimes bleached, making the textile pale or white.

==== Color matching ====
In textiles, color matching extends beyond selecting the appropriate dyestuffs or pigments and combining them in precise proportions to achieve the desired end product color. Meeting criteria for fastness, cost, and quality is also essential. This process plays a critical role in materializing a designer&#x27;s concept into an actual product.

=== Finishes ===
Textile finishing is the process of converting the loomstate or raw goods into a useful product, which can be done mechanically or chemically. Finishing is a broad term that refers to a variety of physical and chemical techniques and treatments that finish one stage of textile production while also preparing for the next. Textile finishing can include aspects like improving surface feel, aesthetical enhancement, and adding advanced chemical finishes. A finish is any process that transforms unfinished products into finished products. This includes mechanical finishing and chemical applications which alter the composition of treated textiles (fiber, yarn or fabric.)

Since the 1990s, with advances in technologies such as permanent press process, finishing agents have been used to strengthen fabrics and make them wrinkle free. More recently, nanomaterials research has led to additional advancements, with companies such as Nano-Tex and NanoHorizons developing permanent treatments based on metallic nanoparticles for making textiles more resistant to things such as water, stains, wrinkles, and pathogens such as bacteria and fungi.

Textiles receive a range of treatments before they reach the end-user. From formaldehyde finishes (to improve crease-resistance) to biocidic finishes and from flame retardants to dyeing of many types of fabric, the possibilities are almost endless. However, many of these finishes may also have detrimental effects on the end user. A number of disperse, acid and reactive dyes, for example, have been shown to be allergenic to sensitive individuals. Further to this, specific dyes within this group have also been shown to induce purpuric contact dermatitis.

, meaning &quot;iron yarn&quot; in English, is a light-reflecting, strong material invented in Germany in the 19th century. It is made by soaking cotton threads in a starch and paraffin wax solution. The threads are then stretched and polished by steel rollers and brushes. The result of the process is a lustrous, tear-resistant yarn which is extremely hardwearing.
== Environmental and health impacts ==
After the oil industry, the fashion industry is the second biggest polluter of agricultural land, which has several harmful impacts on the environment. As the industry grows, the effect on the environment is worsening. Textile manufacturing is one of the oldest and most technologically complicated industries. This industry&#x27;s fundamental strength stems from its solid manufacturing base of a diverse range of fibers/yarns ranging from natural fibers such as jute, silk, wool, and cotton, to synthetic or manufactured fibers that include polyester, viscose, nylon, and acrylic.

Textile mills and their wastewater have grown in proportion to the increase in demand for textile products, generating a severe pollution concern around the world. Numerous textile industry chemicals pose environmental and health risks. Among the compounds in textile effluent, dyes are considered significant contaminants. Water pollution generated by the discharge of untreated wastewater and the use of toxic chemicals, particularly during processing, account for the majority of the global environmental concerns linked with the textile industry.

=== Environmental impacts ===
Clothing is necessary to meet the fundamental needs of humans. Increased population and living standards have increased the need for clothing, enhancing the demand for textile manufacturing; wet processing needs more water consumption. Conventional machinery and treatment procedures use enormous quantities of water, especially for natural fibers, which require up to 150 kg of water per kg of material.
The textile sector is accountable for a substantial number of environmental impacts. However, the discharge of untreated effluents into water bodies is responsible for the majority of environmental harm produced by the textile sector.

The textile sector is believed to use 79 trillion litres of water per year and to discharge around 20% of all industrial effluent into the environment. Reportedly, aromatic and heterocyclic compounds with color-display and polar groups make up most of the dyes used in textile coloration processes. The structure is more complex and stable, making it more difficult to degrade printing and dyeing wastewater.

In addition, textiles constitute a significant percentage of landfill waste. In 2023, North Carolina State University researchers used enzymes to separate cotton from polyester in an early step towards reducing textile waste, allowing each material to be recycled.

=== Health impacts ===
Many kinds of respiratory diseases, skin problems, and allergies may be caused by dyes and pigments discharged into the water.

Although formaldehyde levels in clothing are unlikely to be at levels high enough to cause an allergic reaction, due to the presence of such a chemical, quality control and testing are of utmost importance. Flame retardants (mainly in the brominated form) are also of concern where the environment, and their potential toxicity, are concerned.

==== Chemicals use, advantage and health impacts ====
Certain chemical finishes contain potential hazards to health and the environment. Perfluorinated acids are considered to be hazardous to human health by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
==== Testing ====
Testing for these additives is possible at a number of commercial laboratories. It is also possible to have textiles tested according to the Oeko-tex certification standard, which contains limits levels for the use of certain chemicals in textiles products.

== Laws and regulations ==
Different countries have certain laws and regulations to protect consumers&#x27; interests. The Textile Fiber Products Identification Act is a law that protects consumers in the United States. The act protects producer and consumer interests by implementing labelling (required content disclosure) and advertising requirements on textile products. The Textile Fiber Products Identification Act applies to all textile fiber products besides wool, which is governed by the Wool Product Label Number. The law prohibits misinformation about the fiber content, misbranding, and any unfair advertising practice, as well as requires businesses to operate in a particular manner.

== Testing of textiles ==
Testing occurs at various stages of the textile manufacturing process, from raw material to finished product. The purpose of testing is to evaluate and analyze the regulatory compliance, the product&#x27;s quality and performance, as well as to measure its specifications. Textile testing encompasses a wide range of methodologies, procedures, equipment, and sophisticated laboratories. Local governments and authorized organization&#x27;s such as ASTM International, International Organization for Standardization, and American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists establish standards for testing of textiles.

Some examples of tests at different stages:

For fiber: Fiber identification is a necessary test for determining fiber content and classifying products. The labelling of items with their fiber content percentage is a regulatory requirement. Using microscopy, solubility, and burn tests, fibers are distinguished from one another. More fiber relating tests include fiber length, diameter, Micronaire.

For yarn: Yarn count, Denier, Strength, evenness.

For fabric: Dimensional stability, color fastness, thread count, G.S.M, pilling, flammability.

<text>Putrescine is an organic compound with the formula (CH2)4(NH2)2. It is a colorless solid that melts near room temperature. It is classified as a diamine. Together with cadaverine, it is largely responsible for the foul odor of putrefying flesh, but also contributes to other unpleasant odors.

==Production==
Putrescine is produced on an industrial scale by the hydrogenation of succinonitrile.

Biotechnological production of putrescine from a renewable feedstock has been investigated. A metabolically engineered strain of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; that produces putrescine at high concentrations in glucose mineral salts medium has been described.

==Biochemistry==

Spermidine synthase uses putrescine and &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethioninamine (decarboxylated &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine) to produce spermidine. Spermidine in turn is combined with another &quot;S&quot;-adenosylmethioninamine and gets converted to spermine.

Putrescine is synthesized in small quantities by healthy living cells by the action of ornithine decarboxylase.

Putrescine is synthesized biologically via two different pathways, both starting from arginine.

* In one pathway, arginine is converted into agmatine. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme arginine decarboxylase (ADC). Agmatine is transformed into N-carbamoylputrescine by agmatine imino hydroxylase (AIH). Finally, N-carbamoylputrescine is hydrolyzed to give putrescine.
* In the second pathway, arginine is converted into ornithine and then ornithine is converted into putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC).

Putrescine, via metabolic intermediates including &quot;N&quot;-acetylputrescine, γ-aminobutyraldehyde (GABAL), &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-γ-aminobutyric acid (&quot;N&quot;-acetyl-GABAL), and &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-γ-aminobutyric acid (&quot;N&quot;-acetyl-GABA), biotransformations mediated by diamine oxidase (DAO), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (ABALDH), and other enzymes, can act as a minor biological precursor of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain and elsewhere. In 2021, it was discovered that MAO-B does not mediate dopamine catabolism in the rodent striatum but instead participates in striatal GABA synthesis and that synthesized GABA in turn inhibits dopaminergic neurons in this brain area. It has been found that MAO-B, via the putrescine pathway, importantly mediates GABA synthesis in astrocytes in various brain areas, including in the hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, cerebral cortex, and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc).

==Occurrence==
Putrescine is found in all organisms. Putrescine is widely found in plant tissues, often being the most common polyamine present within the organism. Its role in development is well documented, but recent studies have suggested that putrescine also plays a role in stress responses in plants, both to biotic and abiotic stressors. The absence of putrescine in plants is associated with an increase in both parasite and fungal population in plants.

Putrescine serves an important role in a multitude of ways, which include: a cation substitute, an osmolyte, or a transport protein. It also serves as an important regulator in a variety of surface proteins, both on the cell surface and on organelles, such as the mitochondria and chloroplasts. A recorded increase of ATP production has been found in mitochondria and ATP synthesis by chloroplasts with an increase in mitochondrial and chloroplastic putrescine, but putrescine has also been shown to function as a developmental inhibitor in some plants, which can be seen as dwarfism and late flowering in &quot;Arabiadopsis&quot; plants.

Putrescine production in plants can also be promoted by fungi in the soil. Piriformospora indica (&quot;P. indica&quot;) is one such fungus, found to promote putrescine production in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; and common garden tomato plants. In a 2022 study it was shown that the presence of this fungus had a promotional effect on the growth of the root structure of plants. After gas chromatography testing, putrescine was found in higher amounts in these root structures.

Plants that had been inoculated with &quot;P. indica&quot; had presented an excess of arginine decarboxylase. This is used in the process of making putrescine in plant cells. One of the downstream effects of putrescine in root cells is the production of auxin. That same study found that putrescine added as a fertilizer showed the same results as if it was inoculated with the fungus, which was also shown in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; and barley. The evolutionary foundations of this connection and putrescine are still unclear.

Putrescine is a component of bad breath and bacterial vaginosis. It is also found in semen and some microalgae, together with spermine and spermidine.

== Uses ==
Putrescine reacts with adipic acid to yield the polyamide nylon 46, which is marketed by Envalior (formerly DSM) under the trade name Stanyl.

Application of putrescine, along with other polyamines, can be used to extend the shelf life of fruits by delaying the ripening process. Pre-harvest application of putrescine has been shown to increase plant resistance to high temperatures and drought. Both of these effects seem to result from lowered ethylene production following exogenous putrescine exposure.

Due to its role in putrification, putrescine has also been proposed as a biochemical marker for determining how long a corpse has been decomposing.

Putrescine together with chitosan has been successfully used in postharvest physiology as a natural fruit coating. Putrescine with chitosan treated fruits had higher antioxidant capacity and enzyme activities than untreated fruits. Fresh strawberries coated have lower decay percentage, higher tissue firmness, contents of total soluble solids. Nanoparticles of putrescine with chitosan are effective in preserving the nutritional quality and prolonging the post-harvest life of strawberries during storage up to 12 days.

<doc id="51896" wikidata="Q161555" url="?curid=51896" title="Cadaverine">
<text>Cadaverine is an organic compound with the formula (CH2)5(NH2)2. Classified as a diamine, it is a colorless liquid with an unpleasant odor. It is present in small quantities in living organisms but is often associated with the putrefaction of animal tissue. Together with putrescine, it is largely responsible for the foul odor of putrefying flesh, but also contributes to other unpleasant odors.

==Production==
Cadaverine is produced by decarboxylation of lysine. It can be synthesized by many methods including the hydrogenation of glutaronitrile and the reactions of 1,5-dichloropentane.

==History==
Putrescine and cadaverine were first described in 1885 by the Berlin physician Ludwig Brieger (1849–1919). It was named from the English adjective &quot;cadaverous&quot;.

==Receptors==
In zebrafish, the trace amine-associated receptor 13c (or TAAR13c) has been identified as a high-affinity receptor for cadaverine. In humans, molecular modelling and docking experiments have shown that cadaverine fits into the binding pocket of the human TAAR6 and TAAR8.

==Clinical significance==
Seminal plasma contains cadaverine as basic amines. Elevated levels of cadaverine have been found in the urine of some patients with defects in lysine metabolism. The odor commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis has been linked to cadaverine and putrescine.

==Derivatives==
*Pentolinium and pentamethonium.

==Toxicity==
Acute oral toxicity of cadaverine is 2,000 mg/kg body weight; its no-observed-adverse-effect level is 2,000 ppm (180 mg/kg body weight/day).

<text>The Archers is a British radio soap opera currently broadcast on BBC Radio 4, the corporation&#x27;s main spoken-word channel. Broadcast since 1951, it was famously billed as &quot;an everyday story of country folk&quot; and is now promoted as &quot;a contemporary drama in a rural setting&quot;. Having aired over 20,000 episodes, it is the world&#x27;s longest-running present-day drama by number of episodes.

The first of five pilot episodes was aired on Whit Monday, 29 May 1950, on the BBC Midlands Home Service, and the first episode broadcast nationally went out on New Year&#x27;s Day 1951. A significant show in British popular culture, and with over five million listeners, it is Radio 4&#x27;s most listened-to non-news programme, and with over one million listeners via the internet, the programme holds the record for BBC Radio online listening figures. In February 2019, a panel of 46 broadcasting industry experts, of which 42 had a professional connection to the BBC, listed &quot;The Archers&quot; as the second-greatest radio programme of all time. Partly established with the aim towards educating farmers following World War II, &quot;The Archers&quot; soon became a popular source of entertainment for the population at large, attracting nine million listeners by 1953.

==Setting==
&quot;The Archers&quot; is set in the fictional village of Ambridge in the fictional county of Borsetshire, in England. Borsetshire is situated between what are, in reality, the contiguous counties of Worcestershire and Warwickshire, south of Birmingham in The Midlands of England. Ambridge is possibly based on the village of Cutnall Green, though various other villages claim to be the inspiration for Ambridge; &quot;The Bull&quot;, Ambridge&#x27;s pub, is modelled on The Old Bull in Inkberrow, whereas Hanbury&#x27;s St Mary the Virgin is often used as a stand-in for Ambridge&#x27;s parish church, St Stephen&#x27;s.

Other fictional villages include Penny Hassett, Loxley Barrett, Darrington, Hollerton, Edgeley, Waterley Cross and Lakey Green. The county town of Borsetshire is Borchester, and the nearest big city is the cathedral city of Felpersham. Felpersham also has a university. Anywhere further from Ambridge may be referred to humorously with comments such as &quot;that&#x27;s on the other side of Felpersham!&quot;, but characters do occasionally venture further: several attended the Countryside Alliance march in London, there have been references to the gay scene in Manchester&#x27;s Canal Street. There have been scenes set in other places in the United Kingdom and abroad, with some characters residing overseas such as in South Africa and Hungary.

==Characters==

* The Archers&#x27; family farm, Brookfield, combines arable, dairy, beef, and sheep. It is a typical example of mixed farming which has been passed down the generations from Dan, the original farmer, to his son Phil and is now co-owned by Phil and Jill&#x27;s four children: David, who manages it with his wife Ruth; Shula Hebden-Lloyd, owner of the riding stables, was married to Alistair, a vet; her twin Kenton, runs the village&#x27;s only pub with his wife Jolene; and the widowed Elizabeth Pargeter. Jill lives in Brookfield with her son David, his wife Ruth and their children Pip, Josh and Ben, and Pip&#x27;s daughter, Rosie.
* The Aldridges at Home Farm. Brian, who is portrayed as a money-driven agribusinessman and his late wife Jennifer. They have five children: the two Jennifer brought into their marriage: Adam, a farmer married to chef Ian Craig and Debbie, a farmer based in Hungary; two born into the marriage, Kate with a family abandoned in South Africa, and Alice divorced from farrier Chris Carter; and university student Ruairi, Brian&#x27;s son by one of his affairs. The family also includes Kate&#x27;s daughter Phoebe and Jennifer&#x27;s sister Lilian.
* The Bridge Farm Archers, Tony and Pat, practise organic farming. Their operations include a farm shop, a farm café, a vegetable box scheme and a dairy. The whole family is involved, Tony and Pat and their children Helen and Tom. They also have five grandchildren: Johnny, the son of their deceased son John; Helen&#x27;s sons, Henry and Jack, and Tom&#x27;s twin girls Nova and Seren.
* The Pargetters, a landed gentry family who have to make their stately home, Lower Loxley Hall, pay the bills as a public attraction. The family includes Nigel Pargetter&#x27;s widow, Elizabeth Archer, and her twin children, a son, Freddie and a daughter, Lily.
* The Grundys, formerly struggling tenant farmers were brought to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Initially seen as comic characters, they are now seen as doggedly battling adversity. The family includes Eddie, his wife Clarrie, and their sons Will and Edward.
* The Carters, Neil and Susan. Their son, Chris, was married to Alice Aldridge; their daughter, Emma, has successively married brothers Will and Edward Grundy.
* The Snells; Lynda, married to the long-suffering Robert, is the butt of many jokes, but also an absolute stalwart of village life.

==Ambridge==

Ambridge still has a village shop and post office, originally thanks to the philanthropy of Jack Woolley (d. 2014). The business subsequently became a community shop managed by Susan and run by a team of volunteers. The Bull, the village&#x27;s only pub, is perhaps the most recognisable structure in Ambridge while St. Stephen&#x27;s Church, established in 1281, dates back to Norman times. The church has undergone many changes over the years, including a number of different vicars. The eight bells are rung by a group led by Neil Carter.
* Bridge Farm is a farm previously on Berrow Estate, but now owned by Pat and Tony Archer. The farm became wholly dedicated to organic farming in 1984, in a storyline inspired by a scriptwriter&#x27;s visit to Brynllys farm in Ceredigion, the home of Rachel&#x27;s Organic. In 2003, Tom Archer began producing his Bridge Farm pork sausages. In early 2013, the family decided to sell their dairy herd and buy organic milk instead and the following year, Tony Archer bought a small Aberdeen Angus herd.
* Brookfield Farm is a mixed farm which was managed, and subsequently purchased, by Dan Archer and then by his son Phil. After Phil&#x27;s retirement in 2001, his son David Archer took over.
* Grange Farm was a working farm run by the Grundys until their eviction in 2000. The farmhouse, along with of land, was sold to Oliver Sterling.
* Home Farm is a farm, by far the largest in Ambridge, owned by the Aldridge family. In recent years, Home Farm expanded into soft fruit and deer farming.
* Willow Farm was owned by the Tucker family. Following Betty&#x27;s death in 2005, the house was divided to accommodate Roy and his family. The farmland is home to Neil Carter&#x27;s pigs.
* Arkwright Hall is a large Victorian mansion with a 17th-century atmosphere. The building served as a community centre for many years, containing a soundproofed room and field studies centre. Later it fell into disrepair, but was renovated when Jack Woolley leased the mansion to the Landmark Trust; architect Lewis Carmichael led the restoration of the building to its Victorian splendour.
* Grey Gables, once a country club, is now a luxurious hotel. The late Caroline Sterling bought it with her husband Oliver. The hotel boasts a pool, spa, health club and a golf course. The hotel was sold in 2022 and is closed while undergoing extensive refurbishment.
* Lower Loxley Hall is a large 300-year-old country house located just outside Ambridge. It serves primarily as a conference centre.

==Topicality==
Unlike some soap operas, episodes of &quot;The Archers&quot; portray events taking place on the date of broadcast, allowing many topical subjects to be included. Real-life events which can be readily predicted are often written into the script, such as the annual Oxford Farming Conference and the FIFA World Cup. On some occasions, scenes recorded at these events are planned and edited into episodes shortly before transmission.

More challengingly for the production team, some significant but unforeseen events require scenes to be rewritten and rerecorded at short notice, such as the death of Princess Margaret (particularly poignant because she had appeared as herself on the programme), the World Trade Center attacks, and the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The events and implications of the 2001 foot-and-mouth crisis required many &quot;topical inserts&quot; and the rewriting of several storylines.

In January 2012, Oliver Sterling, owner of Grange Farm, together with his tenant, Ed Grundy, elected to vaccinate the badgers on their farm in an attempt to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis. The plotline came within weeks of the government confirming a badger cull trial.

It was announced on 29 March 2020 that the programme would include reference to the COVID-19 pandemic from 4 May onwards.

The death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022 was discussed by Lynda Snell and Lilian Bellamy as the first section of the episode broadcast on Sunday 11 September.

==Actors==
&quot;The Archers&quot; actors are not held on retainers and usually work on episodes for a few days a month. By the nature of the storylines concentrating on particular groups of characters, in any one week out of a cast of about 60, the episodes include approximately 2030 speaking-characters. Most of the cast do acting work on other projects and can disappear for long periods if they are working on commitments such as films or television series. Tamsin Greig plays Debbie Aldridge and has appeared on many television series such as &quot;Green Wing&quot;, &quot;Love Soup&quot;, &quot;Black Books&quot; and &quot;Episodes&quot;, so Debbie manages a farm in Hungary and her visits to Ambridge are infrequent. Felicity Jones played Emma Carter from the age of 15 but after a period of studying at Wadham College, Oxford, she gave up the role to move into television and cinema.

Some of the actors, when not playing their characters, earn their money through different jobs altogether: Charlotte Connor, when not playing Susan Carter (credited as Charlotte Martin), works full-time as a senior research psychologist at the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation; her office is a short walk from BBC Birmingham, and thus she is able to fit her work around recordings. Graham Blockey, who played Robert Snell before his death in 2022, worked until 2017 as a full-time general practitioner in Surrey, commuting to and from BBC Birmingham at weekends and on his days off. He kept his role secret from his patients, for fear of losing their respect, until his retirement from medicine in March 2017. Other examples include Felicity Finch (Ruth Archer), who also works as a BBC journalist having travelled on a number of occasions to Afghanistan; and Ian Pepperell (Roy Tucker), before his death at the age of 53 on 22 December 2023, managed a pub in the New Forest.

==History==
A five-episode pilot series started on Whit Monday, 29 May 1950, and continued throughout that week. It was created by Godfrey Baseley and was broadcast to the English Midlands in the Regional Home Service, as &#x27;a farming Dick Barton&#x27;. Recordings were sent to London, and the BBC decided to commission the series for a longer national run. In the five pilots the Archers owned Wimberton Farm, rather than Brookfield. Baseley subsequently edited &quot;The Archers&quot; for 22 years.

Since 1 January 1951, five 15-minute episodes (since 1998, six 12½-minute episodes) have been transmitted each week, at first on the BBC Light Programme and subsequently on the BBC Home Service (and Radio 4 from 1 October 1967). Early afternoon repeats of the previous evening&#x27;s episode began on 14 December 1964. The original scriptwriters were Geoffrey Webb and Edward J. Mason, who were also working on the nightly thriller series about the special agent Dick Barton. The popularity of his adventures partly inspired &quot;The Archers&quot;, which eventually took over Barton&#x27;s evening slot. At first, however, the national launch placed the serial at the &quot;terrible&quot; time of 11.45 am, but it moved to Dick Barton&#x27;s former slot of 6.45 pm from 2 April 1951. An omnibus edition of the week&#x27;s episodes began on 5 January 1952.

Originally produced with collaborative input from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, &quot;The Archers&quot; was conceived as a means of disseminating information to farmers and smallholders to help increase productivity in the Postwar era of rationing and food shortages.

&quot;The Archers&quot; originally centred on the lives of three farmers; Dan Archer, farming efficiently with little cash, Walter Gabriel, farming inefficiently with little cash, and George Fairbrother, a wealthy businessman farming at a loss for tax purposes (which one could do in those days). The programme was hugely successful, winning the National Radio Awards&#x27; &#x27;Most entertaining programme of the Year&#x27; award jointly with &quot;Take It from Here&quot; in 1954, and winning the award outright in 1955, in which year the audience was reported to have peaked at 20 million.

In the late 1950s, despite the growth of television and radio&#x27;s consequent decline, the programme was still claiming 11 million listeners and was also being transmitted in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. By the mid-1970s, however, the audience for the two daily broadcasts and the weekend omnibus combined was less than three million and in 1976 the BBC Radio Four Review Board twice considered whether or not to axe the programme. The serial&#x27;s woes at this time were seen to mirror the poor standing of radio drama in general, described as &quot;a failure to fully shake off the conventions of non-realism which had prevailed in the 1940s and 1950s.&quot;

Programme chief Jock Gallagher, responsible for &quot;The Archers&quot;, described these as the serial&#x27;s &quot;dog days&quot;. Sweeping editorial reforms followed, included the introduction of women writers (there had been none before 1975), two of whom, Helen Leadbeater and Margaret Phelan, were credited with giving the programme a new definitive style of writing and content, although some listeners complained about their radical feminism.

In 1980 Julie Burchill commented that the women of Ambridge were no longer stuck with &quot;the gallons of greengage jam old-guard male scriptwriters kept them occupied with for over twenty years&quot;; but were &#x27;into post-natal depression and alcoholism on the way to self-discovery&#x27;. By the mid-1980s the Radio Four Review Board noted that scripts, directing and acting was &quot;very good&quot; and sometimes &quot;better than ever&quot;. In August 1985 &quot;The Listener&quot; said that the programme&#x27;s revival was &quot;sustained by some of the best acting, direction and writing on radio.&quot;

Tony Shryane MBE was the programme&#x27;s producer from 1 January 1951 to 19 January 1979. Vanessa Whitburn was the programme&#x27;s editor from 1992 till 2013. Whitburn took service leave from March to July 2012, and John Yorke, a former executive producer of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, came in as acting editor. Yorke&#x27;s arrival prompted charges that the programme was importing the values of &quot;EastEnders&quot; to Borsetshire, with fans and commentators complaining that characters were behaving unrealistically simply to generate conflict. This was denied by Yorke, who wrote that he agreed to take over &quot;on one condition – that it stayed exactly as it was and that I didn&#x27;t have to change anything.&quot;

Whitburn was succeeded as editor by Sean O&#x27;Connor in September 2013. In September 2016, Huw Kennair-Jones took over as editor though O&#x27;Connor continued to oversee the Helen and Rob storyline until its conclusion. Kennair-Jones announced in October 2017 that he was to leave the BBC to work as commissioning editor for ITV. The short tenure of two successive Archers editors led to concerns of a trend of radio drama editing being seen as &quot;training ground&quot; for higher-paid positions in TV. Alison Hindell, the BBC&#x27;s head of Audio Drama until October 2018, took over as acting editor before and after Kennair-Jones&#x27;s time in charge. She effectively swapped roles with Jeremy Howe when she succeeded him as the BBC&#x27;s commissioning editor for drama and fiction and he started as editor of the Archers in late August 2018.

Since 2007, &quot;The Archers&quot; has been available as a podcast.

Since Easter Sunday 1998, there have been six episodes a week, from Sunday to Friday, broadcast at around 19:03 following the news summary. Episodes are repeated the following day at 14:02 except the Friday evening episode that repeats on Saturday at 14:45, (from 6th April 2024). The six episodes are re-run unabridged in the Sunday morning omnibus at 10:00. On Remembrance Sunday, the omnibus edition begins at the earlier time of 09:15. In March 2024, the BBC announced scheduling changes that will see the Sunday omnibus begin one hour later, at 11.00. 

===Death of Grace Archer===
One of the most controversial &quot;Archers&quot; episodes was broadcast on 22 September 1955, coinciding with the launch of the UK&#x27;s first commercial television station. Phil and Grace Archer had been married just a few months earlier, and their blossoming relationship was the talk of the nation. However, searching for a story which would demonstrate real tragedy among increasingly unconvincing episode cliff-hangers, Godfrey Baseley decided that Grace would have to die. The scripts for the week commencing 19 September 1955 were written, recorded, and broadcast on each day, with an &quot;exercise in topicality&quot; given as the explanation to the cast. On Thursday, listeners heard the sound effects of Grace trying to rescue Midnight, her horse, from a fire in the stable at Brookfield and the crash of a falling timber beam.

Whether the timing of the episode was a deliberate attempt to overshadow the opening night of the BBC&#x27;s first commercial rival has been debated ever since. It was certainly planned some months in advance, but it may well be that the actual date of the death was changed during the scriptwriting stage to coincide with the launch of Associated-Rediffusion. Deliberate or not, the episode attracted widespread media attention, reported by newspapers around the world.

This controversy has been parodied twice: in &quot;The Bowmans&quot;, an episode of the television comedy programme &quot;Hancock&quot;, and in the play &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot; and its 1968 film adaptation. On the 50th anniversary of ITV&#x27;s launch, Ysanne Churchman, who played Grace, sent them a congratulatory card signed &quot;Grace Archer&quot;.

In 1996, William Smethurst recounted a conversation with Baseley in which he reveals his real motivation for killing off Grace Archer: Churchman had been encouraging the other actors to join a trade union.

===Longevity===
The actor Norman Painting played Phil Archer continuously from the first trial series in 1950 until his death on 29 October 2009. His last &quot;Archers&quot; performance was recorded just two days before his death, and was broadcast on 22 November. He is cited in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest-serving actor in a single soap opera. Under the pseudonym &quot;Bruno Milna&quot;, Painting also wrote around 1,200 complete episodes, which culminated in the 10,000th episode.

June Spencer, who celebrated her 100th birthday in 2019, played Peggy Archer (later Woolley) in the pilot episode and continued in the role until 2022.

===Sixtieth anniversary===
The Archers reached its 60th anniversary on 1 January 2011 and to mark this achievement, a special half-hour episode was broadcast on Sunday, 2 January, on BBC Radio 4 from 7pm. The episode had been advertised as containing events that would &quot;shake Ambridge to the core&quot;. This phrase even gave rise to the initialism #SATTC trending on the website Twitter during that weekend as listeners speculated about what might happen, and then reported their views as the story unfolded.

The main events in the episode were Helen Archer giving birth to her son Henry and Nigel Pargetter falling to his death from the roof of Lower Loxley Hall. This unlikely event provoked interest in the frequency and causes of death in the series. In fact, although the incidence of accidental death and suicide is seven times the national average, the overall mortality rate in Ambridge is almost exactly what would be expected.

The demise of Nigel caused controversy among some listeners, with a number of complaints variously expressing dismay at the death of a popular character, concerns over the manner of the dismissal of the actor, belief that the promise to &quot;shake Ambridge to the core&quot; had been over-hyped, criticism of the credibility of the script (for example, the duration of his plummeting cry caused calculation of the building&#x27;s height at considerably more than had been imagined); also a perceived unwillingness of the editorial team to engage with these listener complaints.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
Topical subjects have been added to the script, but this was not possible during the COVID-19 pandemic. Actors were initially recorded in their homes and included references to the pandemic from some of the characters sharing their private thoughts with the listener. From 4 May 2020 to 14 August 2021, the broadcast was reduced to four episodes (Monday – Thursday). Sunday episodes resumed on 15 August 2021.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, weekly programming reduced to four episodes, omitting episodes on Sunday and Friday. The Sunday omnibus was correspondingly reduced in length. After continuing with pre-recorded episodes and repeating some classic episodes, new episodes started that had been recorded remotely, to a mixed reception. On 15 August 2021, the Sunday evening episode resumed regular broadcast, as did the Friday evening episode on 3 June 2022.

===&#x27;Final&#x27; episodes===
On two occasions, special &#x27;final&#x27; episodes of &quot;The Archers&quot; have been produced for the benefit of broadcasters outside the UK who had been running the series but were no longer willing or able to continue. The first was in 1969, for stations in Canada, Kenya and Hong Kong. The second occasion was in 1982, when rising costs meant Radio New Zealand could no longer afford to continue running the series, and a concluding episode was written and produced for them to end &quot;The Archers&quot; with in September that year.

==Themes==
The programme has tackled many serious, contemporary social issues: rural drug addiction; rape, including rape in marriage; inter-racial relationships; direct action against genetically modified crops and badger culling; family break-ups; and civil partnerships, and a family being threatened by a gang of farm thieves. There has been criticism from conservative commentators, such as Peter Hitchens in 1999 that the series has become a vehicle for liberal and left-wing values and agendas, with characters behaving out of character to achieve those goals. However, one of the show&#x27;s charms is to make much out of everyday, small concerns, such as the possible closure of the village shop, the loss and rediscovery of a pair of spectacles, competitive marmalade-making, or nonsense such as a &#x27;spile &#x27; competition, rather than the large-scale and improbable events that form the plots of many soap operas. Godfrey Baseley was quoted in &quot;The Independent&quot; as objecting to the homosexuality in the programme, saying &quot;It is disgusting ... It is distasteful because being gay is such a minority interest. Country folk don&#x27;t do that kind of thing. They have sex the proper way.&quot;

According to some of the actors, and confirmed in the writings of Godfrey Baseley, in its early days the show was used as a conduit for educational announcements from the Ministry of Agriculture, one actor reading an announcement almost verbatim to another. Direct involvement of the government ended in 1972. The show has reacted within a day to agricultural emergencies such as outbreaks of foot and mouth disease which affect farmers nationwide when livestock movements are restricted.

==Theme tune==
The theme tune of &quot;The Archers&quot; is called &quot;Barwick Green&quot; and is a maypole dance from the suite &quot;My Native Heath&quot;, written in 1924 by the Yorkshire composer Arthur Wood. The Sunday omnibus broadcast of &quot;The Archers&quot; starts with a more rustic, accordion-arranged rendition by The Yetties. The theme for BBC Radio 4 Extra&#x27;s &quot;The Archers&quot; spinoff, &quot;Ambridge Extra&quot;, is a version arranged by Bellowhead.

A library music recording of Barwick Green was used for the pilot and during the early years of the national version, because a bid by Godfrey Baseley to have a special theme composed had been turned down on the grounds of cost, put at £250–£300. However, once the serial had become undeniably established, a new recording of Barwick Green was authorised and performed by the BBC Midland Light Orchestra on 24 March 1954. This mono recording was also accompanied by four movements entitled &quot;A Village Suite&quot;, composed by Kenneth Pakeman to complement Barwick Green. Excerpts from these movements were then used for a time as bridging music between scenes. The 1954 recordings were never made available to the public and their use was restricted even inside the BBC, partly because of an agreement with the Musicians&#x27; Union.

In 1992, the theme was re-recorded in stereo, retaining the previous arrangements. The venue was Symphony Hall, Birmingham, the conductor Ron Goodwin, producer David Welsby and the sound mixer Norman McLeod. The slightly different sound mixing and more leisurely tempo reportedly led some listeners to consider the new version inferior, specifically that it lacked &quot;brio&quot;, although the BBC publicised the fact that the orchestra contained some of the musicians who had played in the previous recording, including Harold Rich (piano) and Norman Parker (percussion). 

Robert Robinson once compared the tune to &quot;the genteel abandon of a lifelong teetotaller who has suddenly taken to drink&quot;. On April Fool&#x27;s Day 2004 both &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Today Programme&quot; claimed that BBC executives had commissioned composer Brian Eno to record an electronic version of &quot;Barwick Green&quot; as a replacement for the current theme, while comedian Billy Connolly included in his act the joke that the theme was so typically British that it should be the national anthem of the United Kingdom.

In 2009, comedian Rainer Hersch conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra in a performance of the theme, live from the Royal Festival Hall to a listening BBC Radio 3 audience in an attempt to confuse them. He then went on to show how similar it is to &quot;Montagues and Capulets&quot; – &quot;Dance of the Knights&quot; – from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; by Sergei Prokofiev, claiming that this was a result of Russian spies going through the BBC&#x27;s rubbish bins looking for the scripts.

===Serious events===
At times, a cliffhanger involving the death of a major character or a disaster was marked by the traditional closing theme being replaced by the final dramatic section of &quot;Barwick Green&quot; involving trombones, cymbals and the closing bars of the signature tune – known as the &quot;doom music&quot; to some fan groups. This tradition has been dropped more recently, with events such as the death of Nigel Pargetter being followed by the normal closing music despite the gravity of the incident. This has irritated some followers, who consider the jollity of the normal segment inappropriate in such circumstances.

A brief extract from &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; was played following the death of Phil Archer. When John Archer died no music was played.

There was a nod to &quot;The Archers&quot; in the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London on 27 July 2012, where the theme tune was played at the beginning of a segment celebrating British culture: the sound of a radio could be heard being tuned in as &quot;Barwick Green&quot; was played.

==Casting==
===Current cast===
===Former cast===
==&quot;Ambridge Extra&quot;==
BBC Radio 4 Extra ran an occasional short supplement, &quot;Ambridge Extra&quot;, between 2011 and 2013, featuring characters away from the Ambridge environs. Series 1 and 2 had 26 episodes and series 3, 4 and 5 had 20. The reason offered for non-renewal was limited resources.

==Fan clubs==
Two organisations dedicated to the programme were established in the 1990s. Archers Addicts was the official body, run by members of the cast. The club had five thousand members and an online shop where Archers memorabilia was sold under licence. It closed as a club on 31 December 2013 but still has a Facebook page and Twitter feed. Archers Anarchists was formed sometime later, objecting to the &quot;castist&quot; assumptions propagated by the BBC, and claiming that the characters are real.

The usenet newsgroup uk.media.radio.archers (referred to as UMRA by its users, who call themselves umrats) has been running since 1995. Its users include experts on subjects covered by the programme, such as the many aspects of farming, the running of small businesses, bell ringing; lengthy discussions ensue – as well as light-hearted matters, and plot speculation. Various gatherings occur where umrats come together. The first was a series of about ten annual barbecues. The first was attended by Carole Boyd (Lynda Snell). They have included participants from Europe and the Americas. It has nicknames for many of the main Archers characters, such as S&#x27;aint for Shula. (There are nicknames for most of the regular characters.) Due perhaps to it being initially more accessible in academia, the discussions can be quite detailed, though UMRA considers itself to be a friendly and welcoming group, where in particular flamewars and the like are not welcome. Despite the general decline of usenet with the advent of trendier media such as Facebook and Twitter, UMRA remains a very active newsgroup compared to many. Its one-time T-shirts and mugs bore the legend (in yellow on &quot;Barwick Green&quot;, of course) &quot;An everyday story of internet folk.&quot;

The Academic Archers, founded in 2016, is a community of fans who share an academic approach to the programme. It organises an annual conference at which papers are presented which draw on academic expertise along with enjoyment. Papers from these have been published as &quot;The Archers in Fact and Fiction: Academic Analyses of Life in Rural Borsetshire&quot; (2016, Peter Lang:), &quot;Custard, Culverts and Cake&quot; (2017, Emerald: and &quot;Gender, Sex and Gossip: Women in The Archers&quot; (2019, Emerald: ) The group aims to be &quot;curious, generous and joyful&quot;.

There are four weekly fan podcasts about &quot;The Archers&quot;: &quot;All About The Archers&quot;, &quot;DumTeeDum&quot;, &quot;The Cider Shed&quot; and &quot;Ambridge on the Couch&quot;.

==Parallels==
In 1994, the BBC World Service began broadcasting in Afghanistan &quot;Naway Kor, Naway Jwand&quot; (&quot;New Home, New Life&quot;) an everyday story of country folk incorporating pieces of useful information. Although the useful information was more likely to concern unexploded land mines and opium addiction than the latest modern farming techniques, the inspiration and model of &quot;Naway Kor, Naway Jwand&quot; was &quot;The Archers&quot;, and the initial workshopping with Afghan writers included an &quot;Archers&quot; scriptwriter. A 1997 study found that listeners to the soap opera were significantly less likely to be injured by a mine than non-listeners.

In Rwanda, the BBC World Service&#x27;s Rwanda-Rundi service has been broadcasting the Archers-inspired soap opera &quot;Urunana&quot; (&quot;Hand in Hand&quot;) since 1999.

&quot;The Archers&quot; was the model for the Russian radio soap opera &quot;Dom 7, Podyezd 4&quot; (&quot;House 7, Entrance 4&quot;), on which the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, once made a cameo appearance.

==Parodies==
Tony Hancock starred in the Galton and Simpson spoof &quot;The Bowmans&quot; in an episode of BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;.

Ned Sherrin produced a short 1973 film called &quot;The Cobblers of Umbridge&quot;. The cast included Joan Sims, Lance Percival, Roy Kinnear, Derek Griffiths and John Fortune.

&quot;John Finnemore&#x27;s Souvenir Programme&quot; has parodied &quot;The Archers&quot; with its recurring &quot;The Archers Accidentally&quot; sketches; the sketches claim to portray &quot;The Archers&quot; the way it sounds to people who only listen to the show inadvertently.

The radio series of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; has frequently parodied characters from &quot;The Archers&quot;, including a special edition.

The subtitle was parodied by Bill Tidy in his long-running cartoon of &quot;The Cloggies&quot;, &quot;an Everyday Saga in the Life of Clog Dancing Folk&quot;, which ran in the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;, and later in &quot;The Listener&quot;.

<text>Douglas Arthur Smith (11 February 1924 – 15 October 1972) was a British radio announcer and comedian who spent 25 years with the BBC. He began his broadcasting career with the BBC European Service (now the World Service) in 1946 and later worked as an announcer and newsreader on the Home Service and the Third Programme. He is probably best remembered as the formal announcer on &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; (1958–1964), its successor &quot;Round the Horne&quot; (1965–1968) and the short-lived &quot;Stop Messing About&quot; (1969–1970), where his &quot;BBC accent&quot; was used to comic effect. In this role, he advertised &quot;Dobbiroids&quot; (a fictional product for horses) and the huge number of naïve sound effects he made to assist in the development of humorous and often bizarre plots. Smith performed &quot;Nobody Loves a Fairy When She&#x27;s Forty&quot; in an episode of &quot;Round the Horne&quot;. Many of his roles were portrayals of inanimate objects, e.g., volcanoes, &quot;and I, Douglas Smith, play the part of the volcano&quot;, and &quot;I, Douglas Smith, in my most taxing role to date, play the part of the world.&quot; (spoof on &#x27;Around the World in 80 Days&#x27;).

A Croydonian, he died aged 48 in Kingston upon Thames.

<text>Betty Marsden (24 February 1919 – 18 July 1998) was an English comedy actress. She is particularly remembered as a cast member of the radio series &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; and &quot;Round the Horne&quot;. Marsden appeared in two Carry On films, &quot;Carry On Regardless&quot; (1961) and &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; (1969).

==Early life==
Marsden was born in West Derby, Liverpool, and grew up in near poverty in Somerset. Her music teacher recognised her talent at the age of six, and became her guardian. She attended the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts and during the Second World War she entertained the troops as a member of ENSA.

==Career==
From 1958 to 1968, Marsden was a cast member of the radio series &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; and &quot;Round the Horne&quot;, where she played most of the female characters. Perhaps her most famous catchphrase was &quot;many, many, many times&quot;, delivered in the dry, reedy tones of Bea Clissold, the ancient actress who was renowned for having given pleasure to many, particularly in &quot;The Little Hut&quot; on Shaftesbury Avenue. This long outlasted the Clissold character and was deployed to much audience appreciation on a few occasions in later series, possibly as an ad lib. Another was &quot; &#x27;allo, cheeky face!&quot;, shouted into the microphone in the less-than-couth London tones of Buttercup Gruntfuttock. Marsden&#x27;s vocal range was impressive and also included the husky Daphne Whitethigh, the strident stereotypical Aussie tones of the ultra feminist (but conflicted) Judy Coolibar, and the cut-glass Received Pronunciation of Dame Celia Molestrangler (in a series of loose pastiches of the stilted dialogue in 1930s and 1940s romances and melodramas – for example, &quot;The Astonished Heart&quot; became &quot;The Hasty Nose&quot; – partnered with Hugh Paddick&#x27;s &#x27;ageing juvenile Binkie Huckaback&#x27;, with the denouement inevitably bringing the lovers crashing back to earth).

In 1958, Marsden played the Fairy Godmother, in Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the London Coliseum with Tommy Steele, Kenneth Williams, Yana and Jimmy Edwards.

Her two Carry On films were &quot;Carry On Regardless&quot; (1961), as Mata Hari, and &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; (1969), as Terry Scott&#x27;s wife Harriet, with a braying laugh and jolly bossiness.

Her other film roles included &quot;Ramsbottom Rides Again&quot; (1956), &quot;The Big Day&quot; (1960), &quot;The Boys&quot; (1962), &quot;The Wild Affair&quot; (1964), &quot;The Leather Boys&quot; (1964), &quot;The Best House in London&quot; (1969), and &quot;Eyewitness&quot; (1970). She later played Hermione in &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982), Violet Manning in &quot;The Dresser&quot; (1983), Princess Troubetskaya in &quot;&quot; (1986 TV movie), and Mrs. Barnacle in &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1987).

Her theatre roles included Mrs. Prentice in &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in 1975, and Mrs. Hardcastle in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, in 1982. Her role of Aunt Dahlia was removed from Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s flop musical &quot;Jeeves&quot; (1975) before opening night.

Her television appearances included &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; (Series 4, 1981), &quot;The Bill&quot; (Series 5, 1989) and &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; (1990).

==Personal life and death==
During the Second World War, Marsden met and married Dr Jimmy Wilson Muggoch, an army doctor from Edinburgh. From 1963 the couple lived in Brentford on their houseboat &quot;Chilham&quot;, a converted Thames lighter.

Prior to her death, Marsden had been suffering from heart problems and pneumonia. She was believed to be recovering, but died suddenly while socialising with friends in the bar of Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors, in Northwood in London.
