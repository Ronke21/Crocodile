<text>Sword and sorcery (S&amp;S), or heroic fantasy, is a subgenre of fantasy characterized by sword-wielding heroes engaged in exciting and violent adventures. Elements of romance, magic, and the supernatural are also often present. Unlike works of high fantasy, the tales, though dramatic, focus on personal battles rather than world-endangering matters. The genre originated from the early-1930s works of Robert E. Howard. While there is a chance example from 1953, Fritz Leiber re-coined the term &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; in the 6 April 1961 issue of the fantasy fanzine &quot;Ancalagon&quot;, to describe Howard and the stories that were influenced by his works. In parallel with &quot;sword and sorcery&quot;, the term &quot;heroic fantasy&quot; is used, although it is a more loosely defined genre.

Sword and sorcery tales eschew overarching themes of &quot;good vs evil&quot; in favor of situational conflicts that often pit morally gray characters against one another to enrich themselves, or to defy tyranny.

Sword and sorcery is grounded in real-world social and societal hierarchies, and is grittier, darker, and more violent, with elements of cosmic, often Lovecraftian creatures that aren&#x27;t a staple of mainstream fantasy. The main character is often a barbarian with antihero traits.

==Etymology==
The Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction records a chance example of &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; from 1953, where it appears in a headline of a review of an L. Sprague de Camp novel. American author Fritz Leiber re-coined the term in 1961 in response to a letter from British author Michael Moorcock in the fanzine &quot;Amra&quot;, demanding a name for the sort of fantasy-adventure story written by Robert E. Howard. Moorcock had initially proposed the term &quot;epic fantasy&quot;. Leiber replied in the journal &quot;Ancalagon&quot; (6 April 1961), suggesting &quot;sword-and-sorcery as a good popular catchphrase for the field&quot;. He expanded on this in the July 1961 issue of &quot;Amra&quot;, commenting:

The term &quot;heroic fantasy&quot; has been used to avoid the garish overtones of &quot;sword and sorcery&quot;. This name was coined by L. Sprague de Camp. However, it has also been used to describe a broader range of fantasy, including High fantasy.

==Style and themes==
Sword and sorcery stories take place in a fictional world where magic exists. The setting can be an Earth in the mythical past or distant future, an imaginary other world or an alien planet. Sometimes sword and sorcery stories are influenced by horror, dark fantasy or science fiction. Sword and sorcery, however, does not seek to give a scientific explanation for miraculous events, unlike actual science fiction.

The main character in sword and sorcery stories is usually a powerful warrior who fights against supernatural evil. The typical protagonist is a violent, self-respecting and emotional barbarian who values freedom. The main character often has the characteristics of an antihero. Although the main character mostly behaves heroically, he may ally with an enemy or sacrifice an ally in order to survive. A hero&#x27;s main weapons are cunning and physical strength. Magic, on the other hand, is usually only used by the villains of the story, who are usually wizards, witches, or supernatural monsters. Most sword and sorcery heroes are masculine male characters, while female characters are usually underdeveloped. A recurring theme in the genre is a damsel in distress. However, some sword and sorcery stories have a female protagonist, and the genre&#x27;s traditional emphasis on male protagonists has declined since the last decades of the 20th century.

In his introduction to the 1967 Ace edition of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, L. Sprague de Camp described the typical sword and sorcery story as:

[A] story of action and adventure laid in a more or less imaginary world, where magic works and where modern science and technology have not yet been discovered. The setting may (as in the Conan stories) be this Earth as it is conceived to have been long ago, or as it will be in the remote future, or it may be another planet or another dimension.

Such a story combines the color and dash of the historical costume romance with the atavistic supernatural thrills of the weird, occult, or ghost story. When well done, it provides the purest &quot;fun&quot; of fiction of any kind. It is escape fiction wherein one escapes clear out of the real world into one where all men are strong, all women beautiful, all life adventurous, and all problems simple, and nobody even mentions the income tax or the dropout problem or socialized medicine.
The circular structure is common in sword and sorcery series: the hero stays forever young and every day is like the first for him. The main character&#x27;s victory over his enemies is not final, but in the next short story a new threat arises, against which the hero has to fight once again. The world has a wide variety of exciting and exotic locations designed to act as a stage for the main character&#x27;s exploits. Many sword and sorcery tales have turned into lengthy series of adventures. Their lower stakes and less-than world-threatening dangers make this more plausible than a repetition of the perils of high fantasy. So too does the nature of the heroes; most sword and sorcery protagonists, travellers by nature, find peace after adventure deathly dull.

Sword and sorcery resembles high fantasy, but is darker and more jagged, at times overlapping with dark fantasy. The scale of the struggles depicted is smaller, and the main character usually pursues personal gain, such as wealth or love. The opposition between good and evil characteristic of fantasy also exists in sword and sorcery literature, but it is less absolute and the events often take place in a morally gray area. These features are especially emphasized in newer works of the genre. The stories are fast-paced and action-oriented, with lots of violent fight scenes. Sword and sorcery is by nature a light and escapist genre whose main purpose is to entertain the reader. There is usually no deep message or social statements in the works of this genre.

It is typical for the topics that sword and sorcery deals with to be relatively limited. The genre has sometimes been criticized for excessive violence, misogyny and even fascist attitudes.

==History==
===Origins===
In his introduction to the reference &quot;Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers&quot; by L. Sprague de Camp, Lin Carter notes that the heritage of sword and sorcery is illustrious, and can be traced back to mythology, including the labors of Hercules, as well as to classical epics such as Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the Norse sagas, and Arthurian legend.

It also has been influenced by historical fiction. For instance, the work of Sir Walter Scott was influenced by Scottish folklore and ballads. But few of Scott&#x27;s stories contain fantastic elements; in most, the appearance of such is explained away. Its themes of adventure in a strange society were influenced by adventures set in foreign lands by Sir H. Rider Haggard and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Haggard&#x27;s works, such as &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1885) and &quot;&quot; (1887) included many fantastic elements. Some of Haggard&#x27;s characters, such as Umslopogaas, an axe-wielding Zulu warrior who encountered supernatural phenomena and loved to fight, bore similarities to sword and sorcery heroes. Haggard also wrote &quot;Eric Brighteyes&quot; (1891), a violent historical novel based on the Icelandic Sagas; some writers, (such as David Pringle) have stated that &quot;Eric Brighteyes&quot; resembles a modern sword and sorcery novel.

Sword and sorcery&#x27;s immediate progenitors are the swashbuckling tales of Alexandre Dumas, p√®re (&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1844), etc.), Rafael Sabatini (&quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1921), etc.) and their pulp magazine imitators, such as Talbot Mundy, Harold Lamb, and H. Bedford-Jones, who all influenced Howard. Mundy in particular, proved influential: early sword and sorcery writers such as Robert E. Howard, C. L. Moore and Fritz Leiber were admirers of Mundy&#x27;s fiction. However, these historical &quot;swashbucklers&quot; lack the supernatural element (even though Dumas&#x27; fiction contained many fantasy tropes) which defines the genre.

Another influence was early fantasy fiction. This type of fiction includes the short stories of Lord Dunsany&#x27;s such as &quot;The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth&quot; (1910) and &quot;The Distressing Tale of Thangobrind the Jeweller&quot; (1911). These works of Dunsany&#x27;s feature warriors who clash with monsters and wizards in realms of Dunsany&#x27;s creation. &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; (1922) by E. R. Eddison, a heroic romance written in a mock-archaic style, was an inspiration to later writers of sword and sorcery such as Fritz Leiber. The &quot;Poictesme&quot; novels of James Branch Cabell (such as &quot;&quot; (1919)) have been cited as a stimulus to early sword and sorcery writing. Cabell&#x27;s novels depict picaresque exploits in imaginary lands, and were an influence on Leiber and Jack Vance. A. Merritt&#x27;s novels &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot; (1924) and &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; (1932) have also been cited as influences on sword and sorcery, as they feature men from the then-contemporary world being drawn into dangerous adventures involving swordplay and magic. All these authors influenced sword and sorcery for the plots, characters, and landscapes used.

Also, many early sword and sorcery writers, such as Howard and Clark Ashton Smith, were influenced by the Middle Eastern tales of the Arabian Nights, whose stories of magical monsters and evil sorcerers were an influence on the genre-to-be.

Sword and sorcery&#x27;s frequent depictions of smoky taverns and fetid back alleys draw upon the picaresque genre; for example, Rachel Bingham notes that Fritz Leiber&#x27;s city of Lankhmar bears considerable similarity to 16th century Seville as depicted in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; tale &quot;Rinconete y Cortadillo&quot;.

Sword and sorcery proper only truly began in the pulp fantasy magazines, where it emerged from &quot;weird fiction&quot;. The magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, which published Howard&#x27;s Conan stories and C. L. Moore&#x27;s Jirel of Joiry tales, as well as key influences like H. P. Lovecraft and Smith, was especially important. Lovecraft&#x27;s fiction (especially his &quot;Dream Cycle&quot; of Dunsany-inspired fantasy stories) was a source of inspiration for the first generation of sword and sorcery writers.

The 1929 &quot;Weird Tales&quot; story &quot;The Shadow Kingdom&quot; by Robert E. Howard is often regarded as the first true &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; tale, because it pits a heroic warrior (Kull of Atlantis) against supernatural evil, in an imaginary world of the writer&#x27;s devising.

Howard published only three stories featuring Kull in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. He revised an unsold Kull story, &quot;By This Axe I Rule!&quot; into &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot;, which introduced a new character, Conan the Barbarian. When &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; was published in 1932, it proved popular with the &quot;Weird Tales&quot; readers, and Howard wrote more tales of Conan, of which 17 were published in the magazine.

===Development===
The success of Howard&#x27;s work encouraged other &quot;Weird Tales&quot; writers to create similar tales of adventure in imagined lands. Clark Ashton Smith wrote his tales of the Hyperborean cycle and Zothique for &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the 1930s. These stories revolved around the exploits of warriors and sorcerers in lands of the remote past or remote future, and often had downbeat endings. C. L. Moore, inspired by Howard, Smith and H. P. Lovecraft, created the &quot;Jirel of Joiry&quot; stories for &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, which brought in the first sword and sorcery heroine. Moore&#x27;s future husband Henry Kuttner created Elak of Atlantis, a Howard-inspired warrior hero, for &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in 1938.

Following a change of ownership in 1940, &quot;Weird Tales&quot; ceased to publish sword and sorcery stories. However, the pulp magazine &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot; continued to publish sword and sorcery fiction by Fritz Leiber and Norvell W. Page. Leiber&#x27;s stories revolved around a duo of heroes called Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and dealt with their adventures in the world of Nehwon (&quot;No-When&quot; backwards). Leiber&#x27;s stories featured more emphasis on characterisation and humour than previous sword and sorcery fiction, and his characters became popular with &quot;Unknown&#x27;s&quot; readers. Page&#x27;s sword and sorcery tales centred on Prester John, a Howard-inspired gladiator adventurer, whose exploits took place in Central Asia in the first century CE.

With the diminution of pulp magazine sales in the late 1940s, the focus of sword and sorcery shifted to small-press books. Arkham House published collections by Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith and Fritz Leiber that included some of their sword and sorcery work. Writer Jack Vance published the book &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; in 1950. &quot;The Dying Earth&quot; described the adventures of rogues and wizards on a decadent far-future Earth, where magic had replaced science.

===Rise in popularity===
In the 1960s, American paperback publisher Lancer Books began to reissue Robert E. Howard&#x27;s &quot;Conan&quot; stories in paperback, with cover illustrations by artist Frank Frazetta. These editions became surprise bestsellers, selling millions of copies to a largely young readership. The commercial success of the Conan books encouraged other publishers to put out new and reprinted books in the style of Howard&#x27;s work.

From the 1960s until the 1980s, under the guiding force of Carter, a select group of writers formed the Swordsmen and Sorcerers&#x27; Guild of America (SAGA) to promote and enlarge the sword and sorcery genre. From 1973 to 1981, five anthologies featuring short works by SAGA members were published. Edited by Carter, these were collectively known as &quot;Flashing Swords!&quot;. Because of these and other anthologies, such as the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, his own fiction, and his criticism, Carter is considered one of the most important popularizers of genre fantasy in general, and S&amp;S in particular.

Despite such authors&#x27; efforts, some critics use sword and sorcery as a dismissive or pejorative term. During the 1980s, influenced by the success of the 1982 feature film &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, many fantasy films, some cheaply made, were released in a subgenre that would be called &quot;sword and sorcery&quot;.

Examples of sword and sorcery films include &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; (1982), &quot;The Sword and the Sorcerer&quot; (1982), &quot;Hercules&quot; (1983), a Conan sequel, &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984), &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; (1985) and &quot;Red Sonja&quot; (1985), which, like the Conan films, also starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. The sword and sorcery boom is said to have begun with &quot;Hawk the Slayer&quot; (1980). The sword and planet film &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (1987) contains elements of sword and sorcery and has been called a Conan hybrid.

&quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (1981), &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981) and &quot;Krull&quot; (1983) are characterised as sword and sorcery films by some writers, but this is disputed by Butler. &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) was influenced by sword and sorcery, and in turn influenced &quot;Legend of the Eight Samurai&quot; (1983), a Japanese sword and sorcery style film.

After the cinema and literary boom of the early to mid-1980s, sword and sorcery once again dropped out of favor, with epic fantasy largely taking its place in the fantasy genre. There was, though, another resurgence in sword and sorcery at the end of the 20th century. Sometimes called the &quot;new&quot; or &quot;literary&quot; sword and sorcery, this development places emphasis on literary technique, and draws from epic fantasy and other genres to broaden the genre&#x27;s typical scope. Stories may feature the wide-ranging struggles of national or world-spanning concerns common to high fantasy, but told from the point of view of characters more common to S&amp;S, and with the sense of adventure common to the latter. Writers associated with this include Steven Erikson, Joe Abercrombie, and Scott Lynch, magazines such as &quot;Black Gate&quot; and the ezines &quot;Flashing Swords&quot; (not to be confused with the Lin Carter anthologies), and &quot;Beneath Ceaseless Skies&quot; publish short fiction in the style. According to the literary critic Higashi Masao regarding Japanese works &quot;Guin Saga&quot; and &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen&quot;, they were initially planned by their authors as novels that could be classified as belonging to the European sword and sorcery subgenre but had various major elements that distanced themselves from the typical novels in the genre.

In the 1990s, sword and sorcery boomed in popularity in Britain and other parts of the world.

==Women creators and characters==
Despite the importance of C. L. Moore, Leigh Brackett, Andre Norton, and other female authors, as well as Moore&#x27;s early heroine, sword and sorcery has been characterized as having a masculine bias. Female characters were generally distressed damsels to be rescued or protected, or otherwise served as a reward for a male hero&#x27;s adventures. Women who had adventures of their own often did so to counter the threat of rape or to gain revenge for same. Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s &quot;Sword and Sorceress&quot; anthology series (1984 onwards) tried the reverse, encouraging female writers and protagonists. The stories feature skillful swordswomen and powerful sorceresses working from a variety of motives.

Jessica Amanda Salmonson similarly sought to broaden the range of roles for female characters in sword and sorcery through her own stories and through editing the World Fantasy Award-winning &quot;Amazons&quot; (1979) and &quot;Amazons II&quot; (1982) anthologies; both drew on real and folkloric female warriors, often from areas outside of Europe.

Early sword and sorcery writer Robert E. Howard had espoused feminist views in his personal and professional life. He wrote to his friends and associates defending the achievements and capabilities of women. Strong female characters in Howard&#x27;s works of fiction include Dark Agnes de Chastillon (first appearing in &quot;Sword Woman&quot;, circa 1932‚Äì34), the early modern pirate Helen Tavrel (&quot;The Isle of Pirates&#x27; Doom&quot;, 1928), as well as two pirates and Conan the Barbarian supporting characters, B√™lit (&quot;Queen of the Black Coast&quot;, 1934), and Valeria of the Red Brotherhood (&quot;Red Nails&quot;, 1936).

Introduced as the co-star in a non-fantasy historical story by Howard entitled &quot;The Shadow of the Vulture&quot;, Red Sonya of Rogatino later inspired a fantasy heroine named Red Sonja, who first appeared in the comic book series &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Barry Windsor-Smith. Red Sonja got her own comic book title and eventually a series of novels by David C. Smith and Richard L. Tierney, as well as Richard Fleischer&#x27;s film adaptation in 1985.

==Selected works==
The genre has been defined by Robert E. Howard&#x27;s work, especially his tales of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; and &quot;Kull of Atlantis&quot;, mostly in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; from 1932 and 1929 respectively.

Other books and series that define the genre of sword-and-sorcery include:
* Clark Ashton Smith&#x27;s Hyperborean and Zothique tales, beginning with &quot;The Tale of Satampra Zeiros&quot; and &quot;The Empire of the Necromancers&quot; in 1931 and 1932, respectively.
* C. L. Moore&#x27;s &quot;Jirel of Joiry&quot; tales, beginning with &quot;Black God&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (1934), which introduced the first notable sword and sorcery heroine.
* Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser&quot; sequence, beginning with &quot;Two Sought Adventure&quot; (1939).
* Michael Moorcock&#x27;s &quot;Elric&quot; sequence, beginning with &quot;The Dreaming City&quot; (published in &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; 1961), notable for its adherence to counterstereotype.
* L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s &quot;Swords and Sorcery&quot;, the first sword and sorcery anthology, was published by Pyramid Books in December 1963.
* Karl Edward Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Kane&quot; novels, beginning with &quot;Darkness Weaves&quot; (1970), credited with reinvigorating the genre.
* Robert Lynn Asprin&#x27;s &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot;, a series of shared world anthologies first created in 1978.
* Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s &quot;Return of Nev√®r√øon&quot;, a series of three-story collections and one novel influenced by critical theory, published from 1979 to 1987.
* Charles Saunders&#x27;s &quot;Imaro&quot; novels, beginning with &quot;Imaro&quot; (1981), a collection of short stories first published in the seventies for &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot; fanzine. Imaro was the first notable black sword and sorcery protagonist. L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter had created Juma of Kush as a secondary character in a short story published in 1967.
* Gardner Fox&#x27;s Kothar and Kyrik novels and &quot;Crom the Barbarian&quot;, the first sword and sorcery comic series.

Other pulp fantasy fiction, such as Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Barsoom&quot; series and Leigh Brackett&#x27;s &quot;Sea Kings of Mars&quot;, have a similar feel to sword and sorcery. But, because alien science replaces the supernatural, these books are usually described as planetary romance or sword and planet. They fall more in the area of science fiction. Despite this, planetary romance closely aligns with sword and sorcery, and the work of Burroughs, Brackett, and others in the former field have been significant in creating and spreading S&amp;S proper. Sword and sorcery often blurs the lines between fantasy and science fiction, drawing elements from both like the &quot;weird fiction&quot; it sprang from.

Another notable sword and sorcery anthology series from 1977 through 1979 called &quot;Swords Against Darkness&quot;, edited by Andrew J. Offutt, ran five volumes and featured stories by such authors as Poul Anderson, David Drake, Ramsey Campbell, Andre Norton, and Manly Wade Wellman.

<doc id="53221" wikidata="Q177499" url="?curid=53221" title="Gandalf">
<text>Gandalf is a protagonist in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s novels &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He is a wizard, one of the Istari order, and the leader of the Company of the Ring. Tolkien took the name &quot;Gandalf&quot; from the Old Norse &quot;Catalogue of Dwarves&quot; (&quot;Dvergatal&quot;) in the &quot;V√∂lusp√°&quot;.

As a wizard and the bearer of one of the Three Rings, Gandalf has great power, but works mostly by encouraging and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge and travelling continually. Gandalf is focused on the mission to counter the Dark Lord Sauron by destroying the One Ring. He is associated with fire; his ring of power is Narya, the Ring of Fire. As such, he delights in fireworks to entertain the hobbits of the Shire, while in great need he uses fire as a weapon. As one of the Maiar, he is an immortal spirit from Valinor, but his physical body can be killed. 

In &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Gandalf assists the 13 dwarves and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins with their quest to retake the Lonely Mountain from Smaug the dragon, but leaves them to urge the White Council to expel Sauron from his fortress of Dol Guldur. In the course of the quest, Bilbo finds a magical ring. The expulsion succeeds, but in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Gandalf reveals that Sauron&#x27;s retreat was only a feint, as he soon reappeared in Mordor. Gandalf further explains that, after years of investigation, he is sure that Bilbo&#x27;s ring is the One Ring that Sauron needs to dominate the whole of Middle-earth. The Council of Elrond creates the Fellowship of the Ring, with Gandalf as its leader, to defeat Sauron by destroying the Ring. He takes them south through the Misty Mountains, but is killed fighting a Balrog, an evil spirit-being, in the underground realm of Moria. After he dies, he is sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission as Gandalf the White. He reappears to three of the Fellowship and helps to counter the enemy in Rohan, then in Gondor, and finally at the Black Gate of Mordor, in each case largely by offering guidance. When victory is complete, he crowns Aragorn as King before leaving Middle-earth for ever to return to Valinor.

Tolkien once described Gandalf as an angel incarnate; later, both he and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the Norse god Odin in his &quot;Wanderer&quot; guise. Others have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who assists the protagonists, comparable to the Cumaean Sibyl who assisted Aeneas in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;The Aeneid&quot;, or to the figure of Virgil in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. Scholars have likened his return in white to the transfiguration of Christ; he is further described as a prophet, representing one element of Christ&#x27;s threefold office of prophet, priest, and king, where the other two roles are taken by Frodo and Aragorn. 

The Gandalf character has been featured in radio, television, stage, video game, music, and film adaptations, including Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated film. His best-known portrayal is by Ian McKellen in Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2001‚Äì2003 &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series, where the actor based his acclaimed performance on Tolkien himself. McKellen reprised the role in Jackson&#x27;s 2012‚Äì2014 film series &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

== Names ==

=== Etymology ===

Tolkien derived the name &quot;Gandalf&quot; from Gand√°lfr, a dwarf in the V√∂lusp√°&#x27;s &quot;Dvergatal&quot;, a list of dwarf-names. In Old Norse, the name means &quot;staff-elf&quot;. This is reflected in his name &quot;Thark√ªn&quot;, which is &quot;said to mean &#x27;Staff-man&#x27;&quot; in Khuzdul, the language Tolkien invented for his Dwarves.

=== In-universe names ===

Gandalf is given several names and epithets in Tolkien&#x27;s writings. Faramir calls him the Grey Pilgrim, and reports Gandalf as saying, &quot;Many are my names in many countries. &quot;Mithrandir&quot; among the Elves, Thark√ªn to the Dwarves, Ol√≥rin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Inc√°nus, in the North &quot;Gandalf&quot;; to the East I go not.&quot; In an early draft of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, he is called &quot;Bladorthin&quot;, while the dwarf who was later named Thorin Oakenshield is named Gandalf.

Each Wizard is distinguished by the colour of his cloak. For most of his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf&#x27;s cloak is grey, hence the names Gandalf &quot;the Grey&quot; and Greyhame, from Old English , &quot;cover, skin&quot;. &quot;Mithrandir&quot; is a name in Sindarin meaning &quot;Grey Pilgrim&quot; or &quot;Grey Wanderer&quot;. Midway through &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed Gandalf the White. This change in status (and clothing) introduces another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters who speak Elvish still refer to him as &quot;Mithrandir&quot;. At times in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, other characters address Gandalf by insulting nicknames: Stormcrow, &quot;L√°thspell&quot; (&quot;Ill-news&quot; in Old English), and &quot;Grey Fool&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

Tolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in Middle-earth, one who &quot;seemed the least, less tall than the others, and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a staff&quot;. Yet the Elf C√≠rdan who met him on arrival nevertheless considered him &quot;the greatest spirit and the wisest&quot; and gave him the Elven Ring of Power called Narya, the Ring of Fire, containing a &quot;red&quot; stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the element fire later in the same essay:

== Fictional biography ==

=== Valinor ===

In Valinor, Gandalf was called &quot;Ol√≥rin&quot;. He was one of the Maiar of Valinor, specifically, one of the people of the Vala Manw√´; he was said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was closely associated with two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and Nienna, the patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to send the order of the Wizards (Istari) across the Great Sea to Middle-earth to counsel and assist all those who opposed Sauron, Ol√≥rin was proposed by Manw√´. Ol√≥rin initially begged to be excused, declaring he was too weak and that he feared Sauron, but Manw√´ replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.

As one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic being who had taken human form. As one of those spirits, Ol√≥rin was in service to the Creator (Eru Il√∫vatar) and the Creator&#x27;s &#x27;Secret Fire&#x27;. Along with the other Maiar who entered into Middle-earth as the five Wizards, he took on the specific form of an old man as a sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron&#x27;s strength with their own. It might be, too, that the kings and lords of Middle-earth would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a more glorious form giving them direct commands.

=== Middle-earth ===

The wizards arrived in Middle-earth separately, early in the Third Age; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He seemed the oldest and least in stature, but C√≠rdan the Shipwright felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens, and gave him Narya, the Ring of Fire. Saruman, the chief Wizard, learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and it was not widely known until he left with the other ring-bearers at the end of the Third Age that he, and not C√≠rdan, was the holder of the third of the Elven-rings.

Gandalf&#x27;s relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was strained. The Wizards were commanded to aid Men, Elves, and Dwarves, but only through counsel; they were forbidden to use force to dominate them, though Saruman increasingly disregarded this.

==== The White Council ====
Gandalf suspected early on that an evil presence, the Necromancer of Dol Guldur, was not a Nazg√ªl but Sauron himself. He went to Dol Guldur to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before him, only to return with greater force, and the White Council was formed in response. Galadriel had hoped Gandalf would lead the council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most knowledgeable about Sauron&#x27;s work in the Second Age.

Gandalf returned to Dol Guldur &quot;at great peril&quot; and learned that the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. The following year a White Council was held, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out. Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron&#x27;s evident effort to find the One Ring would fail, as the Ring would long since have been carried by the river Anduin to the Sea; and the matter was allowed to rest. But Saruman began actively seeking the Ring near the Gladden Fields where Isildur had been killed.

==== The Quest of Erebor ====

&quot;The Quest of Erebor&quot; in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; elaborates upon the story behind &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. It tells of a chance meeting between Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield, a Dwarf-king in exile, in the &quot;Prancing Pony&quot; inn at Bree. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the coming war with Sauron, and knew that the North was especially vulnerable. If Rivendell were to be attacked, the dragon Smaug could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could help him regain his lost territory of Erebor from Smaug, and so the quest was born.

=== &quot;The Hobbit&quot; ===

Gandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. He arranges for a tea party, to which he invites the thirteen dwarves, and thus arranges the travelling group central to the narrative. Gandalf contributes the map and key to Erebor to assist the quest. On this quest Gandalf acquires the sword, &quot;Glamdring&quot;, from the trolls&#x27; treasure hoard. Elrond informs them that the sword was made in Gondolin, a city long ago destroyed, where Elrond&#x27;s father lived as a child.

After escaping from the Misty Mountains pursued by goblins and wargs, the party is carried to safety by the Great Eagles. Gandalf then persuades Beorn to house and provision the company for the trip through Mirkwood. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.

He turns up again before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of Esgaroth and the Mirkwood Elves will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug&#x27;s treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and wargs attack all three parties. After the battle, Gandalf accompanies Bilbo back to the Shire, revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the One Ring to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood. Then the Council &quot;put[s] forth its power&quot; and drives Sauron from Dol Guldur. Sauron had anticipated this, and had feigned a withdrawal, only to reappear in Mordor.

=== &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

==== Gandalf the Grey ====

Gandalf spent the years between &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; travelling Middle-earth in search of information on Sauron&#x27;s resurgence and Bilbo Baggins&#x27;s mysterious ring, spurred particularly by Bilbo&#x27;s initial misleading story of how he had obtained it as a &quot;present&quot; from Gollum. During this period, he befriended Aragorn and became suspicious of Saruman. He spent as much time as he could in the Shire, strengthening his friendship with Bilbo and Frodo, Bilbo&#x27;s orphaned cousin and adopted heir.

Gandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo&#x27;s &quot;eleventy-first&quot; (111th) birthday party, bringing many fireworks for the occasion. After Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the ring and disappears, Gandalf urges his old friend to leave the ring to Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile, accusing Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf tells Bilbo that is foolish. Coming to his senses, Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it behind for Frodo as he departs for Rivendell.

Over the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for answers on the ring. He finds some answers in Isildur&#x27;s scroll, in the archives of Minas Tirith. Gandalf searches long and hard for Gollum, often assisted by Aragorn, who eventually succeeds in capturing Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak. Gandalf learns that Sauron had imprisoned Gollum in his fortress of Barad-d√ªr, and tortured him to reveal what he knew of the Ring.

Returning to the Shire, Gandalf confirms his suspicion by throwing the Ring into Frodo&#x27;s hearth-fire and reading the writing that appears on its surface. He tells Frodo the history of the ring, and urges him to take it to Rivendell, warning of grave danger if he stays in the Shire. Gandalf says he will attempt to return for Frodo&#x27;s 50th birthday party, to accompany him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave quietly, as the servants of Sauron will be searching for him.

Outside the Shire, Gandalf encounters the wizard Radagast the Brown, who brings the news that the Nazg√ªl have ridden out of Mordor‚Äîand a request from Saruman that Gandalf come to Isengard. Gandalf asks him to send out animals to observe the Nazg√ªl, and to report to him at Isengard. Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure) with Barliman Butterbur at the Prancing Pony, and heads towards Isengard. There, Saruman horrifies Gandalf by asking him to help him to obtain and use the Ring. Gandalf refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower. Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the Eagle, who comes to him as requested via Radagast.

In Rohan, Gandalf appeals to King Th√©oden for a horse. Th√©oden, under the evil influence of Gr√≠ma Wormtongue, Saruman&#x27;s spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf meets the great horse Shadowfax, who will be his mount and companion. Gandalf rides hard for the Shire, but does not reach it until after Frodo has set out. Knowing that Frodo and his companions will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his own way there. He learns at Bree that the Hobbits have fallen in with Aragorn. He faces the Nazg√ªl at Weathertop, but escapes after an all-night battle, drawing four of them northward. Frodo, Aragorn and company face the remaining five on Weathertop a few nights later. Gandalf reaches Rivendell just before Frodo&#x27;s arrival.

In Rivendell, Gandalf helps Elrond drive off the Nazg√ªl pursuing Frodo, and plays a leading role in the Council of Elrond as the only person who knows the full history of the ring. He reveals that Saruman has betrayed them and is in league with Sauron. When it is decided that the Ring has to be destroyed, Gandalf volunteers to accompany Frodo‚Äînow the Ring-bearer‚Äîin his quest. He persuades Elrond to let Frodo&#x27;s cousins Merry and Pippin join the Fellowship.

Taking charge of the Fellowship (comprising nine representatives of the free peoples of Middle-earth, &quot;set against the Nine Riders&quot;), Gandalf and Aragorn lead the Hobbits and their companions south. After an unsuccessful attempt to cross Mount Caradhras in winter, they cross under the mountains through the Mines of Moria under the Misty Mountains, though only Gimli the Dwarf is enthusiastic about that route. In Moria, they discover that the dwarf colony established there by Balin has been annihilated by orcs. The Fellowship fights with the orcs and trolls of Moria and escapes them.

At the Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm, they encounter &quot;Durin&#x27;s Bane,&quot; a fearsome Balrog from ancient times. Gandalf faces the Balrog to enable the others to escape. After a brief exchange of blows, Gandalf breaks the bridge beneath the Balrog with his staff. As the Balrog falls, it wraps its whip around Gandalf&#x27;s legs, dragging him over the edge. Gandalf falls into the abyss, crying &quot;Fly, you fools!&quot;.

Gandalf and the Balrog fall into a deep lake in Moria&#x27;s underworld. Gandalf pursues the Balrog through the tunnels for eight days until they climb to the peak of Zirakzigil. Here they fight for two days and nights. The Balrog is defeated and cast down onto the mountainside. Gandalf also dies, and his body lies on the peak while his spirit travels &quot;out of thought and time&quot;.

==== Gandalf the White ====

Gandalf is &quot;sent back&quot; as Gandalf the White, and returns to life on the mountain top. Gwaihir carries him to Lothl√≥rien, where he is healed of his injuries and re-clothed in white robes by Galadriel. He travels to Fangorn Forest, where he encounters Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas (who are tracking Merry and Pippin). They mistake him for Saruman, but he stops their attacks and reveals himself.

They travel to Rohan, where Gandalf finds that Th√©oden has been further weakened by Wormtongue&#x27;s influence. He breaks Wormtongue&#x27;s hold over Th√©oden, and convinces the king to join in the fight against Sauron. Gandalf sets off to gather warriors of the Westfold to assist Th√©oden in the coming battle with Saruman. Gandalf arrives just in time to defeat Saruman&#x27;s army in the battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep. Gandalf and the King ride to Isengard, which has just been destroyed by Treebeard and his Ents, who are accompanied by Merry and Pippin. Gandalf breaks Saruman&#x27;s staff and expels him from the White Council and the Order of Wizards; Gandalf takes Saruman&#x27;s place as head of both. Wormtongue tries to kill Gandalf or Saruman with the &quot;palant√≠r&quot; of Orthanc, but misses both. Pippin retrieves the &quot;palant√≠r&quot;, but Gandalf quickly takes it. After the group leaves Isengard, Pippin takes the &quot;palant√≠r&quot; from a sleeping Gandalf, looks into it, and comes face to face with Sauron himself. Gandalf gives the &quot;palant√≠r&quot; to Aragorn and takes the chastened Pippin with him to Minas Tirith to keep the young Hobbit out of further trouble.

Gandalf arrives in time to help to arrange the defences of Minas Tirith. His presence is resented by Denethor, the Steward of Gondor; but when his son Faramir is gravely wounded in battle, Denethor sinks into despair and madness. Together with Prince Imrahil, Gandalf leads the defenders during the siege of the city. When the forces of Mordor break the main gate, Gandalf, alone on Shadowfax, confronts the Lord of the Nazg√ªl. At that moment the Rohirrim arrive, causing the Nazg√ªl to withdraw. Gandalf is about to pursue, but is stopped by Pippin, who requests his intervention to save Faramir ‚Äì Denethor in desperation was seeking to burn himself and his son on a funeral pyre. Gandalf saves Faramir (but not Denethor, who immolates himself), and plays no further part in the unfolding Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

After the battle, Gandalf counsels an attack against Sauron&#x27;s forces at the Black Gate, in an effort to distract the Dark Lord&#x27;s attention from Frodo and Sam; they are at that moment scaling Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. Gandalf, Aragorn and the other leaders of the West lead an army to the Black Gate, meeting the nameless lieutenant of Mordor, who shows them Frodo&#x27;s &quot;mithril&quot; shirt and other items from the Hobbits&#x27; equipment. Gandalf rejects Mordor&#x27;s terms of surrender, starting the Battle of the Morannon. The forces of the West face the full might of Sauron&#x27;s armies, until the Ring is destroyed in Mount Doom. Gandalf leads the Eagles to rescue Frodo and Sam from the erupting mountain.

After the war, Gandalf crowns Aragorn as King Elessar, and helps him find a sapling of the White Tree of Gondor. He accompanies the Hobbits back to the borders of the Shire, before leaving to visit Tom Bombadil.

Two years later, Gandalf departs Middle-earth forever. He boards the Ringbearers&#x27; ship in the Grey Havens and sets sail to return across the sea to the Undying Lands; with him are his horse Shadowfax and his friends Frodo, Bilbo, Galadriel, and Elrond.

== Concept and creation ==

=== Appearance ===

Tolkien&#x27;s biographer Humphrey Carpenter relates that Tolkien owned a postcard entitled &quot;Der Berggeist&quot; (&quot;the mountain spirit&quot;), which he labelled &quot;the origin of Gandalf&quot;. It shows a white-bearded man in a large hat and cloak seated among boulders in a mountain forest. Carpenter said that Tolkien recalled buying the postcard during his holiday in Switzerland in 1911. Manfred Zimmerman, however, discovered that the painting was by the German artist Josef Madlener and dates from the mid-1920s. Carpenter acknowledged that Tolkien was probably mistaken about the origin of the postcard. 

An additional influence may have been V√§in√§m√∂inen, a demigod and the central character in Finnish folklore and the national epic &quot;Kalevala&quot; by Elias L√∂nnrot. V√§in√§m√∂inen was described as an old and wise man, and he possessed a potent, magical singing voice.

Throughout the early drafts, and through to the first edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Bladorthin/Gandalf is described as being a &quot;little old man&quot;, distinct from a dwarf, but not of the full human stature that would later be described in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Even in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Gandalf was not tall; shorter, for example, than Elrond or the other wizards.

=== Name ===
When writing &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in the early 1930s Tolkien gave the name &quot;Gandalf&quot; to the leader of the Dwarves, the character later called Thorin Oakenshield. The name is taken from the same source as all the other Dwarf names (save Balin) in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;: the &quot;Catalogue of Dwarves&quot; in the &quot;V√∂lusp√°&quot;. The Old Norse name &#x27; incorporates the words &#x27; meaning &quot;wand&quot;, &quot;staff&quot; or (especially in compounds) &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;elf&quot;. The name &quot;Gandalf&quot; is found in at least one more place in Norse myth, in the semi-historical Heimskringla, which briefly describes Gandalf Alfgeirsson, a legendary Norse king from eastern Norway and rival of Halfdan the Black. Gandalf is also the name of a Norse sea-king in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s second play, &quot;The Burial Mound&quot;. The name &quot;Gandolf&quot; occurs as a character in William Morris&#x27; 1896 fantasy novel &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot;, along with the horse &quot;Silverfax&quot;, adapted by Tolkien as Gandalf&#x27;s horse &quot;Shadowfax&quot;. Morris&#x27; book, inspired by Norse myth, is set in a pseudo-medieval landscape; it deeply influenced Tolkien. The wizard that became Gandalf was originally named &quot;Bladorthin&quot;.

Tolkien came to regret his &quot;ad hoc&quot; use of Old Norse names, referring to a &quot;rabble of eddaic-named dwarves,¬†... invented in an idle hour&quot; in 1937. But the decision to use Old Norse names came to have far-reaching consequences in the composition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;; in 1942, Tolkien decided that the work was to be a purported translation from the fictional language of Westron, and in the English translation Old Norse names were taken to represent names in the language of Dale. &quot;Gandalf&quot;, in this setting, is thus a representation in English (anglicised from Old Norse) of the name the Dwarves of Erebor had given to Ol√≥rin in the language they used &quot;externally&quot; in their daily affairs, while &quot;Thark√ªn&quot; is the (untranslated) name, presumably of the same meaning, that the Dwarves gave him in their native Khuzdul language.

=== Guide ===

Gandalf&#x27;s role and importance was substantially increased in the conception of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and in a letter of 1954, Tolkien refers to Gandalf as an &quot;angel incarnate&quot;. In the same letter Tolkien states he was given the form of an old man in order to limit his powers on Earth. Both in 1965 and 1971 Tolkien again refers to Gandalf as an angelic being.

In a 1946 letter, Tolkien stated that he thought of Gandalf as an &quot;Odinic wanderer&quot;. Other commentators have similarly compared Gandalf to the Norse god Odin in his &quot;Wanderer&quot; guise‚Äîan old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff, or likened him to Merlin of Arthurian legend or the Jungian archetype of the &quot;wise old man&quot;.

In &quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot;, Douglas Anderson likens Gandalf&#x27;s role to the &quot;R√ºbezahl&quot; mountain spirit of German folktales. He states that the figure can appear as &quot;a guide, a messenger, or a farmer&quot;, often depicted as &quot;a bearded man with a staff&quot;.

The Tolkien scholar Charles W. Nelson described Gandalf as a &quot;guide who .. assists a major character on a journey or quest .. to unusual and distant places&quot;. He noted that in both &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Tolkien presents Gandalf in these terms. Immediately after the Council of Elrond, Gandalf tells the Fellowship:

Nelson notes the similarity between this and Thorin&#x27;s statement in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;:

Nelson gives as examples of the guide figure the Cumaean Sibyl who assisted Aeneas on his journey through the underworld in Virgil&#x27;s tale &quot;The Aeneid&quot;, and then the figure of Virgil in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, directing, encouraging, and physically assisting Dante as he travels through hell. In English literature, Nelson notes, Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; has the wizard Merlin teaching and directing Arthur to begin his journeys. Given these precedents, Nelson remarks, it was unsurprising that Tolkien should make use of a guide figure, endowing him, like these predecessors, with power, wisdom, experience, and practical knowledge, and &quot;aware[ness] of [his] own limitations and [his] ranking in the order of the great&quot;. Other characters who act as wise and good guides include Tom Bombadil, Elrond, Aragorn, Galadriel‚Äîwho he calls perhaps the most powerful of the guide figures‚Äîand briefly also Faramir.

Nelson writes that there is equally historical precedent for wicked guides, such as Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;evil palmers&quot; in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, and suggests that Gollum functions as an evil guide, contrasted with Gandalf, in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. He notes that both Gollum and Gandalf are servants of The One, Eru Il√∫vatar, in the struggle against the forces of darkness, and &quot;ironically&quot; all of them, good and bad, are necessary to the success of the quest. He comments, too, that despite Gandalf&#x27;s evident power, and the moment when he faces the Lord of the Nazg√ªl, he stays in the role of guide throughout, &quot;never directly confront[ing] his enemies with his raw power.&quot;

===Christ-figure===

The critic Anne C. Petty, writing about &quot;Allegory&quot; in the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, discusses Gandalf&#x27;s death and reappearance in Christian terms. She cites Michael W. Maher, S.J.: &quot;who could not think of Gandalf&#x27;s descent into the pits of Moria and his return clothed in white as a death-resurrection motif?&quot; She at once notes, however, that &quot;such a narrow [allegorical] interpretation&quot; limits the reader&#x27;s imagination by demanding a single meaning for each character and event. Other scholars and theologians have likened Gandalf&#x27;s return as a &quot;gleaming white&quot; figure to the transfiguration of Christ.

The philosopher Peter Kreeft, like Tolkien a Roman Catholic, observes that there is no one complete, concrete, visible Christ figure in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; comparable to Aslan in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s Chronicles of Narnia series. However, Kreeft and Jean Chausse have identified reflections of the figure of Jesus Christ in three protagonists of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;: Gandalf, Frodo and Aragorn. While Chausse found &quot;facets of the personality of Jesus&quot; in them, Kreeft wrote that &quot;they exemplify the Old Testament threefold Messianic symbolism of prophet (Gandalf), priest (Frodo), and king (Aragorn).&quot;

== Adaptations ==


In the BBC Radio dramatisations, Gandalf has been voiced by Norman Shelley in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1955‚Äì1956), Heron Carvic in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1968), Bernard Mayes in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1979), and Sir Michael Hordern in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1981).
John Huston voiced Gandalf in the animated films &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (1980) produced by Rankin/Bass. William Squire voiced Gandalf in the animated film &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1978) directed by Ralph Bakshi. Ivan Krasko played Gandalf in the Soviet film adaptation &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1985). Gandalf was portrayed by Vesa Vierikko in the Finnish television miniseries &quot;Hobitit&quot; (1993).

Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series (2001‚Äì2003), directed by Peter Jackson, after Sean Connery and Patrick Stewart both turned down the role. According to Jackson, McKellen based his performance as Gandalf on Tolkien himself:

McKellen confirmed this, and stated that he enjoyed Tolkien&#x27;s letters and readings from the novels. &quot;I am encouraged by the theatricality of his readings full of rhythm and humour and characterisation. Without question Gandalf is like Tolkien but then so, I suspect, are Frodo and Aragorn.&quot; 

McKellen received widespread acclaim for his portrayal of Gandalf, particularly in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, for which he received a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Academy Award nomination, both for best supporting actor. &quot;Empire&quot; named Gandalf, as portrayed by McKellen, the 30th greatest film character of all time. He reprised the role in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series (2012‚Äì2014), claiming that he enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than Gandalf the White. He voiced Gandalf for several video games based on the films, including &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, and &quot;The Third Age&quot;.

In the prequel series &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;, Daniel Weyman portrays a younger version of Gandalf, who is only known as the Stranger until the final episode of the second season, partly because the character functioned as a red herring for the identity of the show&#x27;s version of Sauron.
Charles Picard portrayed Gandalf in the 1999 stage production of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; at Chicago&#x27;s Lifeline Theatre. Brent Carver portrayed Gandalf in the 2006 musical production &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which opened in Toronto.
Gandalf appears in &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, voiced by Todd Hanson. Gandalf is a main character in the video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; and is voiced by Tom Kane.
Gandalf has his own movement in Johan de Meij&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which was written for concert band and premiered in 1988. 
In Aulis Sallinen&#x27;s Symphony No. 7, Op. 71 &#x27;The Dreams of Gandalf&#x27;, the Gandalf theme has the note sequence G-A-D-A-F, &quot;Gandalf&quot; as far as can be formed with the notes A to G. The result is a &quot;striving, rising theme&quot;.

<text>Veins () are blood vessels in the circulatory system of humans and most other animals that carry blood towards the heart. Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are those of the pulmonary and fetal circulations which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. In the systemic circulation, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, and veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart, in the deep veins.

There are three sizes of veins: large, medium, and small. Smaller veins are called venules, and the smallest the post-capillary venules are microscopic that make up the veins of the microcirculation. Veins are often closer to the skin than arteries.

Veins have less smooth muscle and connective tissue and wider internal diameters than arteries. Because of their thinner walls and wider lumens they are able to expand and hold more blood. This greater capacity gives them the term of &quot;capacitance vessels&quot;. At any time, nearly 70% of the total volume of blood in the human body is in the veins. In medium and large sized veins the flow of blood is maintained by one-way (unidirectional) venous valves to prevent backflow. In the lower limbs this is also aided by muscle pumps, also known as venous pumps that exert pressure on intramuscular veins when they contract and drive blood back to the heart.

==Structure==

There are three sizes of vein, large, medium, and small. Smaller veins are called venules. The smallest veins are the post-capillary venules. Veins have a similar three-layered structure to arteries. The layers known as tunicae have a concentric arrangement that forms the wall of the vessel. The outer layer, is a thick layer of connective tissue called the tunica externa or &quot;adventitia&quot;; this layer is absent in the post-capillary venules. The middle layer, consists of bands of smooth muscle and is known as the tunica media. The inner layer, is a thin lining of endothelium known as the tunica intima. The tunica media in the veins is much thinner than that in the arteries as the veins are not subject to the high systolic pressures that the arteries are. There are valves present in many veins that maintain unidirectional flow.

Unlike arteries, the precise location of veins varies among individuals.

Veins close to the surface of the skin appear blue for a variety of reasons. The factors that contribute to this alteration of color perception are related to the light-scattering properties of the skin and the processing of visual input by the visual cortex, rather than the actual colour of the venous blood which is dark red.
==Venous system==

The venous system is the system of veins in the systemic and pulmonary circulations that return blood to the heart. In the systemic circulation the return is of deoxygenated blood from the organs and tissues of the body, and in the pulmonary circulation the pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart. Almost 70% of the blood in the body is in the veins, and almost 75% of this blood is in the small veins and venules. All of the systemic veins are tributaries of the largest veins, the superior and inferior vena cava, which empty the oxygen-depleted blood into the right atrium of the heart. The thin walls of the veins, and their greater internal diameters (lumens) enable them to hold a greater volume of blood, and this greater capacitance gives them the term of &quot;capacitance vessels&quot;. This characteristic also allows for the accommodation of pressure changes in the system. The whole of the venous system, bar the post-capillary venules is a large volume, low pressure system. The venous system is often asymmetric, and whilst the main veins hold a relatively constant position, unlike arteries, the precise location of veins varies among individuals.
Veins vary in size from the smallest post-capillary venules, and more muscular venules, to small veins, medium veins, and large veins. The thickness of the walls of the veins varies as to their location ‚Äì in the legs the vein walls are much thicker than those in the arms. In the circulatory system, blood first enters the venous system from capillary beds where arterial blood changes to venous blood.

Large arteries such as the thoracic aorta, subclavian, femoral and popliteal arteries lie close to a single vein that drains the same region. Other arteries are often accompanied by a pair of veins held in a connective tissue sheath. The accompanying veins are known as venae comitantes, or &quot;satellite veins&quot;, and they run on either side of the artery. When an associated nerve is also enclosed, the sheath is known as a neurovascular bundle. This close proximity of the artery to the veins helps in venous return due to the pulsations in the artery. It also allows for the promotion of heat transfer from the larger arteries to the veins in a counterflow exchange that helps to preserve normal body heat.

;Venules

The first entry of venous blood is from the convergence of two or more capillaries into a microscopic, post-capillary venule. Post-capillary venules have a diameter of between 10 and 30 micrometres (Œºm), and are part of the microcirculation. Their endothelium is made up of flattened oval or polygon shaped cells surrounded by a basal lamina. Post-capillary venules are too small to have a smooth muscle layer and are instead supported by pericytes that wrap around them. Post-capillary venules become muscular venules when they reach a diameter of 50¬†Œºm, and can reach a diameter of 1¬†mm. These larger venules feed into small veins.
;Small, medium, and large veins
The small veins merge to feed as tributaries into medium-sized veins. The medium veins feed into the large veins which include the internal jugular, and renal veins, and the venae cavae that carry the blood directly into the heart. The venae cavae enter the right atrium of the heart from above and below. From above, the superior vena cava carries blood from the arms, head, and chest to the right atrium of the heart, and from below, the inferior vena cava carries blood from the legs and abdomen to the right atrium. The inferior vena cava is the larger of the two. The inferior vena cava is retroperitoneal and runs to the right and roughly parallel to the abdominal aorta along the spine.

;Deep, superficial, and perforator veins
The three main compartments of the venous system are the deep veins, the superficial veins, and the perforator veins. Superficial veins are those closer to the surface of the body, and have no corresponding arteries. Deep veins are deeper in the body and have corresponding arteries. Perforator veins drain from the superficial to the deep veins. These are usually referred to in the lower limbs and feet. Superficial veins include the very small spider veins of between 0.5 and 1¬†mm diameter, and reticular or feeder veins.

;Venous plexuses
There are a number of venous plexuses where veins are grouped or sometimes combined in networks at certain body sites. The Batson venous plexus, runs through the inner vertebral column connecting the thoracic and pelvic veins. These veins are noted for being valveless, believed to be the reason for metastasis of certain cancers.

A subcutaneous venous plexus is continuous, and a high rate of flow is supplied by small arteriovenous anastomoses. The high rate of flow ensures heat transfer to the vein wall.

===Venous valves===

Blood flows back to the heart in the systemic deep veins, with the flow of blood maintained by one-way valves in the deep veins, superficial veins, and in the perforator veins. The venous valves serve to prevent regurgitation (backflow) due to the low pressure of veins, and the pull of gravity. They also serve to prevent the over-widening of the vein.

A venous valve is bicuspid (having two leaflets) and is formed by an infolding of part of the tunica intima on either side of the lumen of the veins. The leaflets are strengthened with collagen, and elastic fibres, and covered with endothelium. The endothelial cells on the surfaces of the leaflets facing the vein wall, are arranged transversely. On the leaflet surfaces that open to let the blood flow, the cells are arranged longitudinally in the direction of the flow. The leaflets are attached to the venous wall at their convex edges. Their margins are concave and are directed with the flow lying against the wall. As the valve forms, the vein wall where the leaflets attach, becomes dilated on each side. These widenings form the pockets, hollow cup-shaped regions, on the cardial side, known as the valvular sinuses. The endothelial cells in the sinuses are able to stretch twice as much as those in areas without valves. When the blood tries to reverse its direction (due to low venous pressure and the pull of gravity), the sinuses fill first closing the leaflets and keeping them together. Approximately 95% of the venous valves are in the small veins of less than 300 micrometres.

The deep veins of the lower limb include the common femoral vein, femoral vein, and the deep femoral vein; the popliteal vein, the tibial, and fibular veins. In the common femoral vein one valve is located above the saphenofemoral junction called the &quot;suprasaphenic valve&quot;. There are sometimes two valves in the same tract. In the femoral vein there are often three valves, the most constantly found valve is just below the joining of the deep femoral vein. The deep femoral vein and its perforators have valves. In the popliteal veins there are between one and three valves; in each posterior tibial vein there are between 8 and 19 valves, and in the anterior tibial veins there are between 8 and 11 valves.

In the superficial veins there are between one and seven valves along the thigh portion of the great saphenous vein (GSV); two to six below the knee and one to four in the marginal veins of the foot. There is a valve at the termination of the GSV known as the &quot;terminal valve&quot; to prevent reflux from the femoral vein A &quot;preterminal valve&quot; is located just below the openings of the tributaries to prevent reflux form these into the GSV. Incompetence of the GSV is a common cause of varicose veins.

The valves also divide the column of blood into segments which helps move the blood unidirectionally to the heart. Their action is supported by the action of skeletal muscle pumps that contract and compress the veins. A skeletal muscle is confined in its fascia and contraction of the muscle which makes it wider results In compression on the vein that pushes the blood forward. Valves in the perforating veins close when a calf muscle contracts, to prevent backflow from the deep veins to the superficial. There are more valves in the lower leg, due to increased gravitational pull, with the number decreasing as the veins travel to the hip. There are no valves in the veins of the thorax or abdomen.

There is a valve at the junction of the inferior vena cava (one of the great vessels) and the right atrium known as the valve of inferior vena cava also known as the &quot;eustachian valve&quot;. This valve is an embryological remnant and is insignificant in the adult. However, when persistent it can cause problems.

===Circulatory routes===

There are some separate parallel systemic circulatory routes that supply specific regions, and organs. They include the coronary circulation, the cerebral circulation, the bronchial circulation, and the renal circulation.

;Coronary circulation
In the coronary circulation, the blood supply to the heart, is drained by cardiac veins (or coronary veins) that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle. These include the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein, the smallest cardiac veins, and the anterior cardiac veins. Cardiac veins carry blood with a poor level of oxygen, from the heart muscle to the right atrium. Most of the blood of the cardiac veins returns through the coronary sinus. The anatomy of the veins of the heart is very variable, but generally it is formed by the following veins: heart veins that go into the coronary sinus: the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein, the posterior vein of the left ventricle, and the oblique vein of the left atrium (oblique vein of Marshall). Heart veins that go directly to the right atrium: the anterior cardiac veins, and the smallest cardiac veins (Thebesian veins).

;Bronchial circulation
In the bronchial circulation that supplies blood to the lung tissues, bronchial veins drain venous blood from the large main bronchi into the azygous vein, and ultimately the right atrium. Venous blood from the bronchi inside the lungs drains into the pulmonary veins and empties into the left atrium; since this blood never went through a capillary bed it was never oxygenated and so provides a small amount of shunted deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation.

;Cerebral circulation
In the cerebral circulation supplying the cerebrum the venous drainage can be separated into two subdivisions: superficial and deep.
The superficial system is composed of dural venous sinuses, which have walls composed of dura mater as opposed to a traditional vein. The dural sinuses are therefore located on the surface of the cerebrum. The most prominent of these sinuses is the superior sagittal sinus which flows in the sagittal plane under the midline of the cerebral vault, posteriorly and inferiorly to the confluence of sinuses, where the superficial drainage joins with the sinus that primarily drains the deep venous system. From here, two transverse sinuses bifurcate and travel laterally and inferiorly in an S-shaped curve that forms the sigmoid sinuses which go on to form the two jugular veins. In the neck, the jugular veins parallel the upward course of the carotid arteries and drain blood into the superior vena cava.

The deep venous drainage is primarily composed of traditional veins inside the deep structures of the brain, which join behind the midbrain to form the vein of Galen. This vein merges with the inferior sagittal sinus to form the straight sinus which then joins the superficial venous system mentioned above at the confluence of sinuses.

;Portal venous systems
A portal venous system is a series of veins or venules that directly connect two capillary beds. The two systems in verebrates are the hepatic portal system, and the hypophyseal portal system.

;Anastomoses
An anastomosis is a joining of two structures such as blood vessels. In the circulation these are called circulatory anastomoses, one of which is the join between an artery with a vein known as an arteriovenous anastomosis. This connection which is highly muscular, enables venous blood to travel directly from an artery into a vein without having passed from a capillary bed.

Abnormal connections can be present known as arteriovenous malformations. These are usually congenital and the connections are made from a tangle of capillaries. A cerebral arteriovenous malformation is one that is located in the brain. An irregular connection between an artery and a vein is known as arteriovenous fistula.

A small specialised arteriovenous anastomosis known as a glomus body or organ serves to transfer heat in the fingers and toes. The small connection is surrounded by a capsule of thickened connective tissue. In the hands and feet there are a great number of glomera.

;Vascular shunt
A vascular shunt can also bypass the capillary bed and provide a route for blood supply directly to a collecting venule. This is achieved by a metarteriole that supplies around a hundred capillaries. At their junctions are precapillary sphincters that tightly regulate the flow of blood into the capillary bed. When all of the sphincters are closed blood can flow from a metarteriole into a thoroughfare channel and into a collecting venule bypassing the capillary bed.

;Other
A communicating vein directly connects two parts of the same system such as the Giacomini vein that connects the (superficial) small saphenous vein with the (superficial) great saphenous vein. Peripheral veins carry blood from the limbs and hands and feet.

==Microanatomy==
The three layers of the vein wall are the outer tunica externa, the middle tunica media and the inner tunica intima. There are also numerous valves present in many of the veins.

The outer tunica externa, also known as the &quot;tunica adventitia&quot; is a sheath of thick connective tissue. This layer is absent in the post-capillary venules.

The middle tunica media is mainly of vascular smooth muscle cells, elastic fibers and collagen. This layer is much thinner than that in arteries. Vascular smooth muscle cells control the size of the vein lumens, and thereby help to regulate blood pressure.

The inner tunica intima is a lining of endothelium comprising a single layer of extremely flattened epithelial cells, supported by delicate connective tissue. This subendothelium is a thin but variable connective tissue. The tunica intima has the most variation in blood vessels, in terms of their wall thickness and relative size of their lumen. The endothelial cells continuously produce nitric oxide a soluble gas, to the cells of the adjacent smooth muscle layer. This constant synthesis is carried out by the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Other endothelial secretions are endothelin, and thromboxane (vasoconstrictors), and prostacyclin a vasodilator.

==Development==
The development of the embryo is completely reliant on the vitelline circulation, the bidirectional flow of blood between the yolk sac and the embryo. The yolk sac is the first extraembryonic structure to appear. This circulation is critical in allowing the exchange of nutrients, prior to the full development of the placenta. By day 17 vessels begin to form in the yolk sac, arising from the splanchnic mesoderm of the yolk sac wall. The capillaries are formed during vasculogenesis, and they lengthen and interconnect to form an extensive primitive vascular network. Blood is supplied from the primitive aorta, and drained by vitelline veins from the yolk sac to the embryo. By the end of the third week the yolk sac, connecting stalk, and chorionic villi are entirely vascularised.

In the middle of the fourth week the heart begins to beat and the circulation of blood begins. The primitive outflow tract is of three pairs of aortic arches. The inflow tract is formed of six paired veins, the vitelline veins, umbilical veins, and the cardinal veins.

== Function ==

In the systemic circulation, veins serve to return oxygen-depleted blood from organs, and tissues to the right heart. From here it passes to the pulmonary arteries for the pulmonary circulation to return oxygen-rich blood to the left heart in the pulmonary veins, to be pumped back into the systemic circulation to complete the cycle. Veins have thinner walls than arteries, and a wider diameter that allow them to expand and hold a greater volume of blood. This gives them a functional role of &quot;capacitance&quot; that makes possible the accommodation of different pressures in the system. The venous system apart from the post-capillary venules is a high volume, low pressure system. Vascular smooth muscle cells control the size of the vein lumens, and thereby help to regulate blood pressure.

The post-capillary venules are &quot;exchange&quot; vessels whose ultra-thin walls allow the ready diffusion of molecules from the capillaries.

The return of blood to the heart is assisted by the action of the muscle pump, and by the thoracic pump action of breathing during respiration. Standing or sitting for a prolonged period of time can cause low venous return from venous pooling (vascular) shock. Fainting can occur but usually baroreceptors within the aortic sinuses initiate a baroreflex such that angiotensin II and norepinephrine stimulate vasoconstriction and heart rate increases to return blood flow. Neurogenic and hypovolaemic shock can also cause fainting. In these cases, the smooth muscles surrounding the veins become slack and the veins fill with the majority of the blood in the body, keeping blood away from the brain and causing unconsciousness. Jet pilots wear pressurized suits to help maintain their venous return and blood pressure.

== Clinical significance ==

Most venous diseases involve obstruction such as a thrombus or insufficiency of the valves, or both of these. Other conditions may be due to inflammation, or compression. Ageing is a major independent risk factor for venous disorders. The medical speciality involved with the diagnosis and treatment of venous disorders is known as phlebology (also &quot;venology&quot;), and the specialist concerned is a phlebologist. There are a number of vascular surgeries and endovascular surgeries carried out by vascular surgeons to treat many venous diseases.

=== Venous insufficiency ===

Venous insufficiency is the most common disorder of the venous system, and is usually manifested as either spider veins or varicose veins. Several treatments are available including endovenous thermal ablation (using radiofrequency or laser energy), vein stripping, ambulatory phlebectomy, foam sclerotherapy, laser, or compression.

Postphlebitic syndrome is venous insufficiency that develops following deep vein thrombosis.

=== Venous thrombosis ===

Venous thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus (blood clot) in a vein. This most commonly affects a deep vein known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but can also affect a superficial vein known as superficial vein thrombosis (SVT).

====Deep vein thrombosis====
DVT usually occurs in the veins of the legs, although it can also occur in the deep veins of the arms. Immobility, active cancer, obesity, traumatic damage and congenital disorders that make clots more likely are all risk factors for deep vein thrombosis. It can cause the affected limb to swell, and cause pain and an overlying skin rash. In the worst case, a deep vein thrombosis can extend, or a part of a clot can break off as an embolus and lodge in a pulmonary artery in the lungs, known as a pulmonary embolism.

The decision to treat deep vein thrombosis depends on its size, symptoms, and their risk factors. It generally involves anticoagulation to prevents clots or to reduce the size of the clot. Intermittent pneumatic compression is a method used to improve venous circulation in cases of edema or in those at risk from a deep vein thrombosis.

====Superficial vein thrombosis====
SVT is the development of a thrombus in a superficial vein. SVT is not normally clinically significant, but the thrombus can migrate into the deep venous system where it can also give rise to a pulmonary embolism. The main risk factor for SVT in the lower limbs is varicose veins.

=== Portal hypertension ===
The portal vein also known as the &quot;hepatic portal vein&quot; carries blood drained from most of the gastrointestinal tract to the liver. Portal hypertension is mainly caused by cirrhosis of the liver. Other causes can include an obstructing clot in a hepatic vein (Budd Chiari syndrome) or compression from tumors or tuberculosis lesions. When the pressure increases in the portal vein, a collateral circulation develops, causing visible veins such as esophageal varices.

===Phlebitis===
Phlebitis is the inflammation of a vein. It is usually accompanied by a blood clot when it is known as thrombophlebitis. When the affected vein is a superficial vein in the leg, it is known as superficial thrombophlebitis, and unlike deep vein thrombosis there is little risk of the clot breaking off as an embolus.

===Compression===
Some disorders as syndromes result from compression of a vein. These include a venous type of thoracic outlet syndrome, due to compression of a subclavian vein; nutcracker syndrome most usually due to compression of the left renal vein, and May‚ÄìThurner syndrome associated with compression of the iliac vein which can lead to iliofemoral DVT. Compression of the superior vena cava most usually by a malignant tumor can lead to superior vena cava syndrome.

===Vascular anomalies===
A vascular anomaly can be either a vascular tumor or a birthmark, or a vascular malformation.
 In a tumor such as infantile hemangioma the mass is soft, and easily compressed, and their coloring is due to the dilated anomalous involved veins. They are most commonly found in the head and neck. Venous malformations are the type of vascular malformation that involves the veins. They can often extend deeper from their surface appearance, reaching underlying muscle or bone. In the neck they may extend into the lining of the mouth cavity or into the salivary glands. They are the most common of the vascular malformations. A severe venous malformation can involve the lymph vessels as a &quot;lymphaticovenous malformation&quot;.

===Venous access===

Venous access is any method used to access the bloodstream through the veins, either to administer intravenous therapy such as medication, or fluid, parenteral nutrition, to obtain blood for analysis, or to provide an access point for blood-based treatments such as dialysis or apheresis. Access is most commonly achieved via the placement of a central venous catheter, a Seldinger technique, and guidance tools such as ultrasound and fluoroscopy can also be used to assist with access location.

=== Imaging ===
Ultrasound, particularly duplex ultrasound, is the most usual and widely used way of viewing veins in the diagnosis of venous disease. Venography is an invasive procedure that uses a catheter to deliver a contrast agent in giving an X-ray of veins. An augmented reality healthcare application is a near-infrared vein finder that films subcutaneous veins, and projects their image either onto a screen or onto the person&#x27;s skin.

====Recognition techniques====
Some imaging techniques using veins have been developed for identification purposes. These vein matching technologies, include finger vein recognition, and eye vein verification.

== History ==

The Greek physician Herophilus (born 335 BC) distinguished veins from arteries, noting the thicker walls of arteries, but thought that the pulse was a property of arteries themselves. Greek anatomist Erasistratus observed that arteries that were cut during life bleed. He ascribed the fact to the phenomenon that air escaping from an artery is replaced with blood that entered by very small vessels between veins and arteries. Thus he apparently postulated capillaries but with reversed flow of blood.

In 2nd century AD Rome, the Greek physician Galen knew that blood vessels carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Growth and energy were derived from venous blood created in the liver from chyle, while arterial blood gave vitality by containing pneuma (air) and originated in the heart. Blood flowed from both creating organs to all parts of the body where it was consumed and there was no return of blood to the heart or liver. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart&#x27;s motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves.
Galen believed that the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the left ventricle to the right by passing through &#x27;pores&#x27; in the interventricular septum, air passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery to the left side of the heart. As the arterial blood was created &#x27;sooty&#x27; vapors were created and passed to the lungs also via the pulmonary artery to be exhaled.

In addition, Ibn al-Nafis had an insight into what would become a larger theory of the capillary circulation. He stated that &quot;there must be small communications or pores (&quot;manafidh&quot; in Arabic) between the pulmonary artery and vein,&quot; a prediction that preceded the discovery of the capillary system by more than 400 years. Ibn al-Nafis&#x27; theory, however, was confined to blood transit in the lungs and did not extend to the entire body.

Finally, William Harvey, a pupil of Hieronymus Fabricius (who had earlier described the valves of the veins without recognizing their function), performed a sequence of experiments, and published &quot;Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus&quot; in 1628, which &quot;demonstrated that there had to be a direct connection between the venous and arterial systems throughout the body, and not just the lungs. Most importantly, he argued that the beat of the heart produced a continuous circulation of blood through minute connections at the extremities of the body. This is a conceptual leap that was quite different from Ibn al-Nafis&#x27; refinement of the anatomy and bloodflow in the heart and lungs.&quot; This work, with its essentially correct exposition, slowly convinced the medical world. However, Harvey was not able to identify the capillary system connecting arteries and veins; these were later discovered by Marcello Malpighi in 1661.

<doc id="53228" wikidata="Q192088" url="?curid=53228" title="Eton College">
<text>Eton College ( ) is a public school providing boarding education for boys aged 13‚Äì18, in the small town of Eton, in Berkshire, in the United Kingdom. It has educated prime ministers, world leaders, Nobel laureates, Academy Award and BAFTA award-winning actors, and generations of the aristocracy, and has been referred to as &quot;the nurse of England&#x27;s statesmen&quot;. The school is the largest boarding school in England, ahead of Millfield and Oundle. Together with Wellington College and Downe House School, it one of three private schools in Berkshire to be named in the list of the world&#x27;s best 100 private schools.

Eton charges up to ¬£52,749 per year (¬£17,583 per term, with three terms per academic year, for 2023/24). It was the sixth most expensive Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference boarding school in the UK in 2013‚Äì14.

It was founded in 1440 by Henry VI as Kynge&#x27;s College of Our Ladye of Eton besyde Windesore, making it the 18th-oldest school in the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference (HMC). Originally intended as a sister institution to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Eton is known for its history, wealth, and notable alumni, known as Old Etonians.

Eton is one of three public schools, along with Harrow (1572) and Radley (1847), to have retained the boys-only, boarding-only tradition, which means that its boys live at the school seven days a week during term time. The remainder of them, including Charterhouse in 1971, Westminster in 1973, Rugby in 1976, Shrewsbury in 2015, and Winchester in 2022, have since become co-educational.

== History ==

===Establishment===


Eton College was founded by Henry VI as a charity school to provide free education to 70 poor boys who would then go on to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, founded by the same king in 1441. Henry used Winchester College as a model, visiting at least six times (in 1441, 1444, 1446, 1447, 1448, 1449, 1451, 1452) and having its statutes transcribed. Henry appointed Winchester&#x27;s headmaster, William Waynflete, as Eton&#x27;s Provost, and transferred some of Winchester&#x27;s 70 scholars to start his new school. There is a rumour that he also had carts of earth from Winchester transported to Eton.

When Henry VI founded the school, he granted it a large number of endowments, including much valuable land. The group of feoffees appointed by the king to receive forfeited lands of the Alien Priories for the endowment of Eton were as follows:
* Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1443)
* Thomas Spofford, Bishop of Hereford (d. 1456)
* John Low, Bishop of Rochester (d. 1467)
* William Ayscough, Bishop of Salisbury (d. 1450)
* William de la Pole, 1st Marquess of Suffolk (1396‚Äì1450) (later Duke of Suffolk)
* John Somerset (d. 1454), Chancellor of the Exchequer and the king&#x27;s doctor
* Thomas Beckington (c. 1390‚Äì1465), Archdeacon of Buckingham, the king&#x27;s secretary and later Keeper of the Privy Seal
* Richard Andrew (d. 1477), first Warden of All Souls College, Oxford, later the king&#x27;s secretary
* Adam Moleyns (d. 1450), Clerk of the Council
* John Hampton (d. 1472) of Kinver, Staffordshire, an Esquire of the Body
* James Fiennes, another member of the Royal Household
* William Tresham, another member of the Royal Household

It was intended to have formidable buildings; Henry intended the nave of the College Chapel to be the longest in Europe, and several religious relics, supposedly including a part of the True Cross and the Crown of Thorns. He persuaded the then Pope, Eugene IV, to grant him a privilege unparalleled anywhere in England: the right to grant indulgences to penitents on the Feast of the Assumption. The college also came into possession of one of England&#x27;s Apocalypse manuscripts.

However, when Henry was deposed by King Edward IV in 1461, the new King annulled all grants to the school and removed most of its assets and treasures to St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, on the other side of the River Thames. Legend has it that Edward&#x27;s mistress, Jane Shore, intervened on the school&#x27;s behalf. She was able to save a good part of the school, although the royal bequest and the number of staff were much reduced. Construction of the chapel, originally intended to be slightly over twice as long, with 18, or possibly 17, bays (there are eight today) was stopped when Henry VI was deposed. Only the Quire of the intended building was completed. Eton&#x27;s first Head Master, William Waynflete, founder of Magdalen College, Oxford and previously headmaster of Winchester College, built the ante-chapel that completed the chapel. The important wall paintings in the chapel and the brick north range of the present School Yard also date from the 1480s; the lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, were built between 1441 and 1460.

As the school suffered reduced income while still under construction, the completion and further development of the school have since depended to some extent on wealthy benefactors. Building resumed when Roger Lupton was Provost, around 1517. His name is borne by the big gatehouse in the west range of the cloisters, fronting School Yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school. This range includes the important interiors of the Parlour, Election Hall, and Election Chamber, where most of the 18th century &quot;leaving portraits&quot; are kept.

&quot;After Lupton&#x27;s time, nothing important was built until about 1670, when Provost Allestree gave a range to close the west side of School Yard between Lower School and Chapel&quot;. This was remodelled later and completed in 1694 by Matthew Bankes, Master Carpenter of the Royal Works. The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister, 1725‚Äì29, by Thomas Rowland. It has a very important collection of books and manuscripts.

=== 19th century onwards ===

The Duke of Wellington is often incorrectly quoted as saying that &quot;The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton.&quot; Wellington was at Eton from 1781 to 1784 and was to send his sons there. According to Nevill (citing the historian Sir Edward Creasy), what Wellington said, while passing an Eton cricket match many decades later, was, &quot;There grows the stuff that won Waterloo&quot;, a remark Nevill construes as a reference to &quot;the manly character induced by games and sport&quot; among English youth generally, not a comment about Eton specifically. In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert&#x27;s &quot;C&#x27;est ici qu&#x27;a √©t√© gagn√©e la bataille de Waterloo&quot; (&quot;It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won&quot;).

The architect John Shaw Jr (1803‚Äì1870) became a surveyor to Eton. He designed New Buildings (1844‚Äì46), Provost Francis Hodgson&#x27;s addition to provide better accommodation for collegers, who until then had mostly lived in Long Chamber, a long first-floor room where conditions were inhumane.

Following complaints about the finances, buildings and management of Eton, the Clarendon Commission was set up in 1861 as a royal commission to investigate the state of nine schools in England, including Eton.
Questioned by the commission in 1862, Head Master Edward Balston came under attack for his view that in the classroom little time could be spared for subjects other than classical studies.

As with other public schools, a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiarise privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas. The project of establishing an &quot;Eton Mission&quot; in the crowded district of Hackney Wick in east London was started at the beginning of 1880, and it lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project (at Dorney) would be more realistic. However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by G. F. Bodley was erected; many Etonians visited and stimulated among other things the Eton Manor Boys&#x27; Club, a notable rowing club which has survived the Mission itself, and the 59 Club for motorcyclists.

The large and ornate School Hall and School Library (by L. K. Hall) were erected in 1906‚Äì08 across the road from Upper School as the school&#x27;s memorial to the Etonians who had died in the Boer War. Many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead Etonians of the First World War. A bomb destroyed part of Upper School in World War II and blew out many windows in the chapel. The college commissioned replacements by Evie Hone (1949‚Äì52) and by John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens (1959 onward).

Among Head Masters of the late 19th and 20th centuries were Cyril Alington, Robert Birley and Anthony Chenevix-Trench. M. R. James was a Provost. Between the years 1926 and 1939, Eton pupils were included as part of a group of around 20 or 30 selected public school boys who travelled yearly to various British Empire countries as part of the Public School Boys Empire Tour. The first tour travelled to Australia; the last went to Canada. The purpose of the tours was to encourage Empire settlement, with the boys possibly becoming district officers in India or imperial governors of the Dominions.

In 1959, the college constructed a nuclear bunker to house the college&#x27;s Provost and fellows. The facility is now used for storage. In 1969, Dillibe Onyeama became the first black person to obtain his school-leaving certificate from Eton. Three years later Onyeama was banned from visiting Eton after he published a book which described the racism that he experienced during his time at the school. Simon Henderson, current Head Master of Eton, apologised to Onyeama for the treatment he endured during his time at the school, although Onyeama did not think the apology was necessary.

In 2005, the school was one of fifty of the country&#x27;s leading independent schools found to have breached the Competition Act 1998 (see Eton College controversies). In 2011, plans to attack Eton College were found on the body of a senior al-Qaeda leader shot dead in Somalia.

=== Controversies ===
== Overview ==
=== Coat of arms ===

The coat of arms of Eton College was granted in 1449 by the founder King Henry VI, as recorded as follows on the original charter, attested by the Great Seal of England and preserved in the College archives:

:&quot;On a field sable three lily-flowers argent, intending that Our newly founded College, lasting for ages to come, whose perpetuity We wish to be signified by the stability of the sable colour, shall bring forth the brightest flowers redolent of every kind of knowledge; to which also, that We may impart something of royal nobility which may declare the work truly royal and illustrious, We have resolved that that portion of the arms which by royal right belong to Us in the Kingdoms of France and England be placed on the chief of the shield, per pale azure with a flower of the French, and gules with a leopard passant or&quot;.

Thus the blazon is: &quot;Sable, three lily-flowers argent on a chief per pale azure and gules in the dexter a fleur-de-lys in the sinister a lion passant guardant or&quot;. The three lilies are also evident on the coat-of-arms of Eton provost Roger Lupton. Although the charter specifies that the lily flowers relate to the founder&#x27;s hope for a flourishing of knowledge, that flower is also a symbol for the Virgin Mary, in whose honour the college was founded, with the number of three having significance to the Blessed Trinity. The motto of the college is &quot;Floreat Etona&quot; (&quot;may Eton flourish&quot;). The grant of arms to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, is worded identically, but with roses instead of lily-flowers.

===Governance and management===
The school is headed by a Provost, a vice-provost and a board of governors (known as Fellows) who appoint the Head Master. the school governors include:

* [Sir Nicholas Coleridge] (Provost)
* Peter Mckee (Vice Provost)
* Professor Michael Proctor
* Princess Antonia, Duchess of Wellington
* Lady Moore of Etchingham
* Mark Esiri
* George Leggatt, Lord Leggatt 
* Sir Mark Lyall Grant 
* Helena Morrissey, Baroness Morrissey 
* Simon Vivian 
* Professor Francis Brown (mathematician) (2022) 
* Professor Ewan Birney 

Statute VII of the College provides that the board shall be populated as follows (in addition to the Provost and Vice-Provost):

* The Provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge
* One Fellow to be elected by the Provost &amp; Fellows, who is or has been a member of a faculty of, or a fellow of a college at the University of Oxford
* One Fellow to be elected by the Provost &amp; Fellows, who is or has been a member of a faculty of, or a fellow of a college at the University of Cambridge
* One Fellow to be nominated by the Council of the Royal Society following identification by the Provost &amp; Fellows or a suitable candidate from amongst the Fellowship of the Royal Society
* One Fellow to be nominated by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales
* One Fellow to be elected by the Head Master, Lower Master, and Assistant Masters
* Four Fellows to be elected by the Provost and Fellows themselves
The current Provost, William Waldegrave, Baron Waldegrave of North Hill, has made public that he will be stepping down as Provost after the 2024 Summer Half (summer term).

===Houses===
The school contains 25 boys&#x27; houses, each headed by a housemaster, selected from the more senior members of the teaching staff, which numbers some 155. Almost all of the school&#x27;s pupils go on to universities, about a third of them to the University of Oxford or University of Cambridge.

==== King&#x27;s Scholars ====

One boarding house, &quot;College&quot;, is reserved for 70 King&#x27;s Scholars, who attend Eton on scholarships provided by the original foundation and awarded by examination each year; King&#x27;s Scholars used to pay up to 90 per cent of full fees, depending on their means. This financial incentive has been phased out. Still, up to a third receive some kind of bursary or scholarship. The name &#x27;King&#x27;s Scholars&#x27; refers to the foundation of the school by King Henry VI in 1440. The original school consisted of the 70 Scholars (together with some Commensals) and the Scholars were educated and boarded at the foundation&#x27;s expense.

King&#x27;s Scholars are entitled to use the letters &#x27;KS&#x27; after their name and they can be identified by a black gown worn over the top of their tailcoats, giving them the nickname &#x27;tugs&#x27; (Latin: &quot;togati&quot;, wearers of gowns); and occasionally by a surplice in Chapel. The house is looked after by the Master in College. Having succeeded in the examination, they include many of the most academically gifted boys in the school.

==== Oppidans ====
As the school grew, more pupils were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in boarding-houses within the town of Eton, outside the college&#x27;s original buildings. These pupils became known as Oppidans, from the Latin word &quot;oppidum&quot;, meaning &quot;town&quot;. The houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the 18th and 19th centuries the housemasters started to rely more for administrative purposes on a senior female member of staff, known as a &quot;dame&quot;, who became responsible for the physical welfare of the boys. (Some houses had previously been run by dames without a housemaster.) Each house typically contains about 50 boys. Although classes are organised on a school basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their house.

Not all boys who pass the college election examination choose to become King&#x27;s Scholars, which involves living in &quot;College&quot; with its own ancient traditions, wearing a gown, and therefore a degree of separation from the other boys. If they choose instead to belong to one of the 24 Oppidan houses, they are simply regarded as Oppidans. However, they may still earn a non-financial award that recognises their academic capabilities. This is known as an Oppidan Scholarship. The title of Oppidan Scholar is awarded for consistently performing with distinction in school and external examinations (&quot;Trials&quot;): to earn the title, a boy must obtain either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his school career. Within the school, an Oppidan Scholar is entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;OS&quot;.

Each Oppidan house is usually referred to by the initials (forenames and surname) of its current housemaster, a senior teacher (&quot;beak&quot;), or more formally by his surname alone, not by the name of the building in which it is situated. Houses occasionally swap buildings according to the seniority of the housemaster and the physical desirability of the building. The names of buildings occupied by houses are used for few purposes other than a correspondence address. They are: Godolphin House, Jourdelay&#x27;s (both built as such c. 1720), Hawtrey House, Durnford House (the first two built as such by the Provost and Fellows, 1845, when the school was increasing in numbers and needed more centralised control), The Hopgarden, South Lawn, Waynflete, Evans&#x27;s, Keate House, Warre House, Villiers House, Common Lane House, Penn House, Walpole House, Cotton Hall, Wotton House, Holland House, Mustians, Angelo&#x27;s, Manor House, Farrer House, Baldwin&#x27;s Bec, The Timbralls, and Westbury.

==== House structure ====

In addition to the housemaster, each house has two house captains, two house captains of games and a house captain of arts. All house positions are entitled to &quot;Stick-Ups&quot; (a white bow tie and winged collar). Some houses may have more house captains than the standard rule. House prefects were once elected from the oldest year, but this no longer happens. The old term &quot;Library&quot; survives in the name of the room set aside for the oldest year&#x27;s use, where boys have their own kitchen and living space. Similarly, boys in their penultimate year have a room known as &quot;Debate&quot;.

There are entire house gatherings every evening, usually around 8:05‚Äì8:30¬†p.m. These are known as &quot;Prayers&quot;, due to their original nature. The house master and boys have an opportunity to make announcements, and sometimes the boys provide light entertainment. For much of Eton&#x27;s history, junior boys had to act as &quot;fags&quot;, or servants, to older boys. Their duties included cleaning, cooking, and running errands. A Library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice, &quot;Boy, Up!&quot; or &quot;Boy, Queue!&quot;, and all first-year boys had to come running. The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as fagging, were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s. Captains of house and games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from the school office.

There are many inter-house competitions, mostly in sports but also in academics, drama and music.

===Headmasters===
The Head Master is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference and the school is a member of the Eton Group of independent schools in the United Kingdom.
The school appointed its first female Lower Master (deputy head), Susan Wijeratna, in 2017. She was succeeded by Paul Williams in 2023 as she took on the role of headmistress at Latymer Upper School.

===Former pupils===

Eton has a long list of distinguished former pupils. In 2019, Boris Johnson became the 20th British prime minister to have attended the school, and the fifth since the end of the Second World War. Previous Conservative leader David Cameron was the 19th British prime minister to have attended the school, and recommended that Eton set up a school in the state sector to help drive up standards.

=== Fame ===
Eton has been described as the most famous public school in the world, and has been referred to as &quot;the chief nurse of England&#x27;s statesmen&quot;. Eton has educated generations of British and foreign aristocracy, and for the first time, members of the British royal family in direct line of succession: the Prince of Wales and his brother the Duke of Sussex, in contrast to the royal tradition of male education at either naval college or Gordonstoun, or by tutors.

The &quot;Good Schools Guide&quot; called the school &quot;the number one boys&#x27; public school&quot;, adding that &quot;The teaching and facilities are second to none.&quot; The school is a member of the G30 Schools Group. Eton today is a larger school than it has been for much of its history. In 1678, there were 207 boys. In the late 18th century, there were about 300, while today, the total has risen to over 1,300.

The school is included in The Schools Index as one of the 150 best private schools in the world and among top 30 senior schools in the UK.

=== Financial support ===
About 20% of pupils at Eton receive financial support, through a range of bursaries and scholarships. A recent Head Master, Tony Little, said that Eton was developing plans to allow any boy to attend the school whatever his parents&#x27; income and, in 2011, said that around 250 boys received &quot;significant&quot; financial help from the school. In early 2014, this figure had risen to 263 pupils receiving the equivalent of around 60% of school fee assistance, whilst a further 63 received their education free of charge. Little said that, in the short term, he wanted to ensure that around 320 pupils per year receive bursaries and that 70 were educated free of charge, with the intention that the number of pupils receiving financial assistance would continue to increase. The Orwell Award is a sixth form scholarship awarded to boys in UK state schools whose academic performance may have been held back by personal circumstance. Boys who earn this award attend the school on a 100% bursary.

=== Changes to the school ===
Registration at birth, corporal punishment, and fagging are no longer practised at Eton. Academic standards were raised, and by the mid-1990s Eton ranked among Britain&#x27;s top three schools in getting its pupils into Oxford and Cambridge.

The proportion of boys at the school who were sons of Old Etonians fell from 60% in 1960 to 20% in 2016. This has been attributed to a number of factors, including: the dissolution of the house lists, which allowed Old Etonians to register their sons at birth, in 1990; harder entrance examinations as the emphasis on academic attainment increased; a sharp rise in school fees increasingly beyond the means of many UK families; and increased applications from international, often very wealthy, families.

=== School terms ===

There are three academic terms (known as halves) in the year:
* The &quot;Michaelmas Half&quot;, from early September to mid-December. New boys are now admitted only at the start of the Michaelmas Half, unless in exceptional circumstances.
* The &quot;Lent Half&quot;, from mid-January to late March.
* The &quot;Summer Half&quot;, from late April to late June or early July.

They are called halves because the school year was once split into two halves, between which the boys went home.

==School life==
=== Uniform ===
The School is known for its traditions, including a uniform of black tailcoat (or morning coat) and black waistcoat, a starched stiff collar and black pinstriped trousers. Most pupils wear a white &quot;tie&quot; which is a narrow strip of cloth folded over the joint of the collar to hide the collar stud, but some senior boys are entitled to wear a white bow tie and winged collar (&quot;Stick-Ups&quot;). These include boys part of select prefect bodies, those who represent their house as a type of House Captain (general, sports or arts) and those who are &quot;keepers&quot; of areas of the school. There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority; see School Prefects and King&#x27;s Scholars sections.

The long-standing belief that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of King George III in 1820 is unfounded. In 1862, Edward Balston, Head Master, noted little in the way of uniform in an interview with the Clarendon Commission.

Lord Clarendon: One more question, which bears in some degree upon other schools, namely with regard to the dress. The boys do not wear any particular dress at Eton?
Edward Balston: No, with the exception that they are obliged to wear a white neckcloth.

Lord Clarendon: Is the colour of their clothes much restricted?

Edward Balston: We would not let them wear for instance a yellow coat or any other colour very much out of the way.

Lord Clarendon: If they do not adopt anything very extravagant either with respect to colour or cut you allow them to follow their own taste with respect to the choice of their clothes?

Edward Balston: Yes.

Lord Lyttelton: They must wear the common round hat?

Edward Balston: Yes.

The uniform worn today was gradually adopted and standardised towards the end of the nineteenth century. Until 1967, boys under the height of wore a cropped jacket (known as an Eton jacket, mess jacket, or &quot;bum-freezer&quot;) instead of a tailcoat.

=== Tutors and teaching ===
Teachers are known officially as &quot;Masters&quot; but may also be referred to unofficially as &quot;beaks&quot;. The pupil to teacher ratio is 8:1, which is extremely low by typical UK school standards. Class sizes start at around twenty to twenty-five in the first year and are often below ten by the final year.

The original curriculum concentrated on prayers, Latin and devotion, and &quot;as late as 1530 no Greek was taught&quot;. Later the emphasis was on classical studies, dominated by Latin and Ancient History, and, for boys with sufficient ability, Classical Greek. From the latter part of the 19th century this curriculum has changed and broadened: for example, there are now more than 100 students of Chinese, which is a non-curriculum course. In the 1970s, there was just one school computer, in a small room attached to the science buildings. It used punched tape to store programmes. Today, all boys must have laptop computers and are given iPads for their school work, and the school fibre-optic network connects all classrooms and all boys&#x27; bedrooms to the internet.

The primary responsibility for a boy&#x27;s studies lies with his House Master, but he is assisted by an additional director of studies, known as a tutor. Classes, formally known as &quot;divisions&quot; (&quot;divs&quot;) or &quot;schools&quot;, are organised on a School basis; the classrooms are separate from the houses. New blocks of classrooms have appeared approximately every decade since the construction of New (mathematics) Schools, designed by Henry Woodyer and built 1861‚Äì63. Despite the introduction of modern technology, the external appearance and locations of many of the classrooms have remained unchanged for a long time. The oldest classroom still in use, &quot;Lower School&quot;, dates from the 15th century, though this is now used more for religious services and as a detention centre.

Every evening, about 75 minutes, known as Quiet Hour, is set aside, during which boys are expected to study or prepare work for their teachers if not otherwise engaged. Specialists (boys in sixth form) are not obliged to observe Quiet Hours but must still remain quiet and respectful during the allocated time. Some Houses, at the discretion of the House Master, may observe a second Quiet Hour after prayers in the evening. This is less formal, with boys being allowed to visit each other&#x27;s rooms to socialise if neither boy has work outstanding. The Independent Schools Inspectorate&#x27;s report for 2016 says, &quot;The achievement of pupils is exceptional. Progress and abilities of all pupils are at a high level. Pupils are highly successful in public examinations, and the record of entrance to universities with demanding entry requirements in the United Kingdom and overseas is strong.&quot;

In 2017, a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) schools skills ranking table, designed to show employability, showed the school performed disproportionally badly, falling to 109th place and behind many state schools. Edwina Dunn, the chairwoman of the company producing the report, called for schools to be reassessed based on how suitable pupils are for businesses in the post-Brexit world.

=== School publications ===

&quot;The Chronicle&quot; is the official school magazine, having been founded in 1863. It is edited by boys at the school. Although liable to censorship, it has a tradition of satirising and attacking school policies, as well as documenting recent events. &quot;The Oppidan&quot;, founded in 1828, was published once a half; it covered all sport in Eton and some professional events as well, but ceased to exist until a recent revival in 2023. &quot;The Junior Chronicle&quot; is the official school magazine of Lower Boys (pupils in their first two years at Eton) and it is written, edited and designed solely by them. In 2022, the Press Office became known as the Eton College Journalism Association. A totally boy-run team, headed by a Master, now runs the publication which reports on notable events across school life and societies, serving as an important summary of all that happens within the School.

Other school magazines, including &quot;The Academic Yearbook&quot;, &quot;The Arts Review&quot;, and &quot;The Eton Zeitgeist&quot; have been published, as well as publications produced by individual departments such as &quot;The 1440 Review&quot; (history), &quot;The Agathon&quot; (philosophy), &quot;The Axiom&quot; (mathematics), &quot;Scientific Etonian&quot; (science), &quot;The Ampersand&quot; (English), &quot;Biopsy&quot; (medicine), &quot;The Lexicon&quot; (modern languages) and &quot;The Etonal&quot; (music). Online publications also include &quot;EtonSTEM&quot; (STEM subjects) and &quot;The Florentina&quot; (environmental).

=== Societies ===
At Eton, there are many organisations known as &#x27;societies&#x27;, in many of which pupils come together to discuss a particular topic or to listen to a lecture, presided over by a senior pupil, and often including a guest speaker. As of September 2024, there are 80 clubs, activities and societies in existence, catering for a wide range of interests and largely run by boys.

=== Grants and admissions ===

Prizes are awarded on the results of trials (internal exams), GCSE and AS-levels. In addition, many subjects and activities have specially endowed prizes, several of which are awarded by visiting experts. The most prestigious of these is the Newcastle Scholarship. The Newcastle Scholarship is awarded on the strength of an examination, consisting of two papers in philosophical theology, moral theory and applied ethics. The Keynes Prize is awarded on an examination of a particular topic within the branch of Economics.

The Rosebery Prize for History is awarded on the same day as the Newcastle Scholarship, and follows a similar format of a three-hour exam during the Lent Half (although the Newcastle Scholarship is awarded on the basis of two such examinations). Also of note is the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Coutts Prize, awarded on the results of trials and AS-level examinations in C block (Year 12); and the Huxley Prize, awarded for a project on a scientific subject. Other specialist prizes include the Newcastle Classical Prize (which was formerly the same prize as the Newcastle Scholarship, but the two were separated as a decreasing number of philosophers were fluent in Latin and Classical Greek); the Queen&#x27;s Prizes for French and German; the Duke of Newcastle&#x27;s Russian Prize; the Beddington Spanish Prize; the Strafford and Bowman Shakespeare Prizes; the Tomline and Russell Prizes for Mathematics; the Robert Bridges Prize for English; the Sotheby Prize for History of Art; the Waddington Prize for Theology and Philosophy; the Birley Prize for History; the Rorie Mackenzie Prize for Modern Languages; the Robert Boyle Prize for Physics; the Macmillan Prize for Politics; the Wilder Prize for Theology and the Hervey Verse Prize for poetry in senior years.

Prizes are awarded too for excellence in activities outside of academics. The Loder Declamation Prize is one of the oldest prizes and the most prestigious non-academic prize in the School where boys are required to read a bible passage, a monologue from a Shakespeare play, and a set of prose. Other non-academic prizes are awarded for activities such as painting, sculpture, ceramics, playing musical instruments, musical composition, acting, backstage work, classical and modern language declamation, silverwork, and design.

Various benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad. These include the Busk Fund, which supports individual ventures that show particular initiative; the C. M. Wells Memorial Trust Fund, for the promotion of visits to classical lands; the Sadler Fund, which supports, among others, those intending to enter the Foreign Service; and the Marsden Fund, for travel in countries where the principal language is not English.

=== Incentives and sanctions ===
Eton has a well-established system for encouraging boys to produce high-standard work. An excellent piece of work may be rewarded with a &quot;Show Up&quot;, to be shown to the boy&#x27;s tutors as evidence of progress. If, in any particular term, a pupil makes a particularly good effort in any subject, he may be &quot;Commended for Good Effort&quot; to the Head Master (or Lower Master). If any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be &quot;Sent Up For Good&quot;, storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity. This award has been around since the 18th century. As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton&#x27;s boys. First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department. Upon receiving approval from the Head of Department, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the pupil will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.

The opposite of a Show Up is a &quot;Rip&quot;. This is for sub-standard work, which is sometimes torn at the top of the page/sheet and must be submitted to the boy&#x27;s housemaster for signature. Boys who accumulate rips are liable to be given a &quot;White Ticket&quot;, a form of a progress report which must be signed at intervals by all his teachers and may be accompanied by other punishments, usually involving doing domestic chores or writing lines. In recent times, a milder form of the rip, &#x27;sign for information&#x27;, colloquially known as an &quot;info&quot;, has been introduced, which must also be signed by the boy&#x27;s housemaster and tutor. Internal examinations are held at the end of the Michaelmas half (i.e. autumn term) for all pupils except those in the last year, and in the Summer half for those in the first, second and fourth years (i.e. those not taking a full set of public examinations). These internal examinations are called &quot;Trials&quot;. Boys who fail to achieve a certain mark in a subject in a set of trials are &#x27;flagged&#x27;, and sometimes asked to revise that subject over the coming holidays to then re-sit the exam at the beginning of the next half.

A boy who is late for any division or other appointments may be required to sign &quot;Tardy Book&quot;, a register kept in the School Office, between 7:35 am and 7:45 am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days). Tardy Book may also be issued for late work. For more serious misdeeds, a boy is placed &quot;on the Bill&quot;, which involves him being summoned by the sudden entry of a prefect (Sixth Form Select) into one of his divisions, who announces in a loud and formal tone that at a given time a certain pupil must attend the office of the Head Master, or Lower Master if the boy is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds. In such cases the pupil would ordinarily receive a detention of either one or two hours in length, however it is possible for no punishment to be given if a sufficient explanation is provided. The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, suspension, or rustication (a form of suspension which doesn&#x27;t go on one&#x27;s disciplinary record) or in former times, beating. Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils may claim it as a &quot;run&quot; and absent themselves for the rest of its duration, provided they report their intention so to do at the School Office.

A traditional punishment took the form of being made to copy, by hand, Latin hexameters. Offenders were frequently set 100 hexameters by Library members, or, for more serious offences, Georgics (more than 500 hexameters) by their House Masters or the Head Master. The giving of a Georgic is now extremely rare, but still occasionally occurs.

=== Corporal punishment ===
Eton used to be renowned for its use of corporal punishment, generally known as &quot;beating&quot;. In the 16th century, Friday was set aside as &quot;flogging day&quot;. A special wooden birching block was used for the purpose, with the boy being directed to fetch it and then kneel over it. John Keate, Head Master from 1809 to 1834, took over at a time when discipline was poor. Until 1964, offending boys could be summoned to the Head Master or the Lower Master, as appropriate, to receive a birching on the bare posterior, in a semi-public ceremony held in the Library, where there was a special wooden birching block over which the offender was held. Anthony Chenevix-Trench, Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with caning, also applied to the bare buttocks, which he administered privately in his office.

Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys. Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane offenders over the seat of the trousers. This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table. Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see Eton Society below) in the form of a &quot;Pop-Tanning&quot;, in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke). The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds. This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.

Chenevix-Trench&#x27;s successor from 1970, Michael McCrum, retained private corporal punishment by masters but ended the practice of requiring boys to take their trousers and underpants down when bending over to be caned by the Head Master. By the mid-1970s, the only people allowed to administer caning were the Head Master and the Lower Master.

Corporal punishment was phased out in the 1980s. The film director Sebastian Doggart claims to have been the last boy caned at Eton, in 1984.

=== Prefects ===
In addition to the masters, the following three categories of senior boys are entitled to exercise School discipline. Boys who belong to any of these categories, in addition to a limited number of other boy office holders, are entitled to wear winged collars with bow ties (known as &quot;Stick-Ups&quot;).
* Pop: officially known as &#x27;Eton Society&#x27;, a society comprising the most well-regarded, confident and able senior boys. It is a driving ambition of many capable Eton schoolboys to be elected to Pop, and many high-performers who are refused entry to this society consider their careers at Eton a failure. Boris Johnson was a member of Pop, whilst David Cameron (unlike his elder brother Alexander) failed to be elected, which possibly fed their later political rivalry.

Over the years its power and privileges have grown. Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton, created in 1811 by Charles Fox Townshend. The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters. Now, it involves a complex process where all boys in C Block, all teachers, Housemasters, Dames, and the current Pop vote for who they think are the best candidates. The Lower Master then compiles all this information and holds a final meeting called the &#x27;Pop Committee&#x27;, where all members are decided upon, including which of these members are to be chosen as the President of Pop, Chairman of Pop, Captain of the School and Captain of the Oppidans. Members of Pop wear a braided tailcoat (buttonhole), white and black houndstooth-checked trousers, a starched stick-up collar and a white bow-tie, and are entitled to wear flamboyant waistcoats, often of their own design.

Historically, only members of Pop were entitled to furl their umbrellas or sit on the wall on the Long Walk, in front of the main building. However, these traditions have died out. They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including school plays, parents&#x27; evenings and other official events, and generally maintain order. Notable ex-members of Pop include the Prince of Wales (unlike his younger brother the Duke of Sussex, who failed to be elected), Eddie Redmayne, Arthur Hallam, William Ewart Gladstone, Stafford Northcote, Lord Rosebery and Tom Hiddleston. The former Provost Lord Waldegrave was both the President of Pop and Captain of the School.
* Sixth Form Select: an academically selected prefectorial group consisting, by custom, of the 10 senior King&#x27;s Scholars and the 10 senior Oppidan Scholars (though recently, high-achieving pupils who are not King&#x27;s or Oppidan Scholars have also been admitted entry).

The number of Sixth Form Select has grown over time. Members of Sixth Form Select are entitled to wear silver buttons on their waistcoats. They also act as Praepostors: they enter classrooms in mid-lesson without knocking and ask in a loud and formal tone, &quot;Is (family name) in this division?&quot; followed by &quot;He is to see the Head Master at (time) on the bill&quot; (the &quot;Bill&quot;, see above). Members of Sixth Form Select also perform &quot;Speeches&quot;, a formal event held five times a year, most notably on Fourth of June. The names of members of Sixth Form Select are engraved in the Head Master&#x27;s Schoolroom.
* House Captains: The captains of each of the 25 boys&#x27; houses (see above). There are usually either one or two per house. They have little responsibility at a school level, but nonetheless act as representatives of their houses and help maintain order within the house. House Captains are entitled to wear a mottled-grey waistcoat with their house colours at the back. It is possible to belong to &quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Sixth Form Select&quot; and be a House Captain at the same time. It is less common for a House Captain to belong to Pop but it still happens fairly often.

The position of the Head Boys of Eton is divided into four roles: President of Pop, Chairman of Pop, Captain of the School and Captain of the Oppidans. The first two are the leaders of Pop and the latter two are the leaders of Sixth Form Select. Captain of the School and Captain of the Oppidans are also in Pop and in the Monarch (rowing prefect body) &quot;ex officio&quot;.

In the era of Queen Elizabeth I, there were two praepostors in every form, who noted down the names of absentees. Until the late 19th century, there was a praepostor for every division of the school.

==Extra‚Äìcurricular activities==
=== Sports ===
Sport is a feature of Eton; which has nearly 200 acres of playing fields and amenity land. The names of the playing fields include Agar&#x27;s Plough, Dutchman&#x27;s, Upper Club, Lower Club, Sixpenny/The Field, and Mesopotamia (situated between two streams and often shortened to &quot;Mespots&quot;).

* During the Michaelmas Half, the sport curriculum is dominated by football (called &quot;Association&quot;) and rugby union, with some rowing for a smaller number of boys.
* During the Lent Half it is dominated by the field game, a code of football, but this is unique to Eton and cannot be played against other schools. However, using strategies from the field game, the Eton football team (Old Etonians F.C.) reached the finals of the FA Cup 6 times, winning twice in 1879 and 1882. During this half, Collegers also play the Eton wall game; this game received national publicity when it was taken up by Prince Harry. Aided by AstroTurf facilities on Masters&#x27; field, field hockey has become a major Lent Half sport along with Rugby 7&#x27;s. Elite rowers prepare for the Schools&#x27; Head of the River Race in late March.
* During the Summer Half, sporting boys divide into &quot;dry bobs&quot;, who play cricket, tennis or athletics, and &quot;wet bobs&quot;, who row on the River Thames and the rowing lake in preparation for The National Schools Regatta and the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta.

The rowing lake at Dorney was developed and is owned by the college. It was the venue for the rowing and canoeing events at the 2012 Summer Olympics and the World Junior Rowing Championships. The annual cricket match against Harrow at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground is the oldest fixture of the cricketing calendar, having been played there since 1805. A staple of the London society calendar since the 1800s, in 1914, its importance was such that over 38,000 people attended the two days&#x27; play, and in 1910 the match made national headlines but interest has since declined considerably, and the match is now a one-day limited overs contest. In the 2024 match, Harrow were the victors.

In 1815, Eton College documented its football rules, the first football code to be written down anywhere in the world. Eton Match was the annual cricket match between Eton and Winchester held at each school alternately. First played in 1826, it was originally just the cricket match, held over two days, with a dinner or concert or dance on one of the evenings. Eton Match, as such, ceased to exist by 2001.

There is a running track at the Thames Valley Athletics Centre and an annual steeplechase. The running track was controversial as it was purchased with a ¬£3m National Lottery grant with the school getting full daytime use of the facilities in exchange for ¬£200k and of land. The bursar claimed that Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic club was &quot;deprived&quot; because it did not have a world-class running track and facilities for training and the Sports Council agreed, saying the whole community would benefit. However Steve Osborn, director of the Safe Neighbourhoods Unit, described the decision as &quot;staggering&quot; given substantial reduction in youth services by councils across the country. The facility which became the Thames Valley Athletics Centre opened in April 1999.

Eton&#x27;s Shooting VIII competed in the Ashburton Shield for many decades against the other major public schools. In July 1935, the &quot;Public School Rivalry&quot; was reported thus: &quot;Charterhouse, Harrow, Winchester, Eton, Rugby and Clifton, all previous winners, were determined to add to their laurels&quot; in the competition. Eton reportedly drew with Charterhouse and beat Clifton in the July 1939 competition held at Bisley. As with the other schools, Eton&#x27;s cadet corps sent a team of eight men ‚Äì the Shooting VIII ‚Äì to compete annually at Bisley.

Among the other sports played at Eton is Eton Fives.

=== Olympic rowing ===
In 2006, six years before the 2012 London Summer Olympics and London 2012 Summer Paralympic Games, Eton completed the construction of Dorney Lake, a permanent, eight-lane, 2,200 metre course (about 1.4 miles) in a 400-acre park. Eton financed the construction from its own funds. Officially known throughout the Games as &quot;Eton Dorney&quot;, Dorney Lake provided training facilities for Olympic and Paralympic competitors, and during the Games, hosted the Olympic and Paralympic Rowing competitions as well as the Olympic Canoe Sprint event. It attracted over 400,000 visitors during the Games period (around 30,000 per day), and was voted the best 2012 Olympic venue by spectators. Thirty medal events were held on Dorney Lake, during which Team GB won a total of 12 medals, making the lake one of the most successful venues for Team GB. The FISA President, Denis Oswald, described it as &quot;the best-ever Olympic rowing venue&quot;. In June 2013, it hosted the World Rowing Cup. Access to the parkland around the Lake is provided to members of the public, free of charge, almost all the year round.

=== Music ===
The current &quot;Precentor&quot; (Director of Music) is Tim Johnson, who took over from Ralph Allwood in September 2011. The School has eight organs and an entire building for music (performance spaces include two concert venues: the Parry Hall and the Concert Hall). The Salata Auditorium (School Hall) is the largest concert venue in the school, seating about 700 people. The College Chapel and Lower Chapel also act as a centre of choral music.

The School has a variety of musical groups, including two chapel choirs, a symphony and chamber orchestra, jazz bands, a marching band, a pipe band, a gospel choir, a pop choir, two a cappella groups and numerous rock bands who regularly perform at open gig nights and more. Music production and technology, as well as musical theatre, have also grown in popularity in recent years. The College Chapel Choir (the main chapel choir of the School) perform three times a week in regular services in College Chapel on top of a rigorous rehearsal schedule. They often perform at other large events such as at St. Andrew&#x27;s Day, the &quot;Fourth of June&quot;, Ascension Day, the Carol Service, Remembrance Day, and joint evensongs with other chapel choirs, such as those of Winchester College and St. George&#x27;s Chapel. The Symphony Orchestra performs at the end of every term in a large School Concert, which always includes a piece featuring a large solo number performed by a boy. The Summer term School Concert also consists of the &quot;Vale&quot;, the Eton Boating Song, which is sung by the most esteemed singers in B Block as they prepare to leave the School. Both the choir (and its complementary boy-run a cappella group, the &quot;Incognitos&quot;) and the orchestra regularly tour internationally to countries such as France, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Latvia, the USA and Hong Kong. Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones such as the didgeridoo.

The School participates in many national competitions; many pupils are part of the National Youth Orchestra and National Youth Choir. The School gives scholarships and exhibitions for dedicated and talented musicians, as well as honorary exhibitions for boys who have proven their musical ability throughout their time at Eton, though these provide no financial benefit directly. Those with a scholarship or exhibition are entitled to have the post-nominal letters &quot;MS&quot; or &quot;ME&quot; depending on what form of award they have. Every year a choral scholarship is also awarded to someone who has proven exceptional choral and singing abilities, but then not in other fields of music. Recipients of this award have typically been choristers at top collegiate and cathedral choirs across the country, such as those of Westminster Cathedral and St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Many boys go on to continue singing in choirs as choral scholars or playing the organ as organ scholars at Oxford and Cambridge. Former Precentor Ralph Allwood set up and organised Eton Choral Courses, now the Rodolfus Foundation, which run at the School, as well as at Oxford and Cambridge amongst other venues, every summer.

Every two year, Eton employs a &#x27;Composer-in-Residence&#x27;, an external professional composer on a two-year contract who normally commissions new music for the main choir, as well as teaching Music GCSE and A Level to most year groups. In 2009, the School&#x27;s musical prot√©g√©s came to wider notice when featured in a TV documentary &quot;A Boy Called Alex&quot;. The film followed an Etonian, Alex Stobbs, a musician with cystic fibrosis, as he worked toward conducting the difficult &quot;Magnificat&quot; by Johann Sebastian Bach. Other notable musical prodigies at the School include piano prodigy Ryan Wang who joined the school in September 2020, now under the guidance of Ms. Jennie-Helen Moston. The School has produced many famous musicians in its history, including Hubert Parry, the writer of the hymn &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and the coronation anthem &quot;I was glad&quot;.

=== Drama ===

Numerous plays are put on every year at Eton College; there is one main theatre, called the Farrer (seating 400) and 2 Studio theatres, called the Caccia Studio and Empty Space (seating 90 and 80 respectively). There are about 8 or 9 house productions each year, around 3 or 4 &quot;independent&quot; plays (plays produced, directed and funded by boys) and three school plays, one specifically for boys in the first two years, and two open to all years. The school plays have such good reputations that they are normally fully booked every night.

In recent years, the School has put on a musical version of &quot;The Bacchae&quot; (October 2009) as well as productions of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (May 2010), &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; (February 2011), &quot;Joseph K&quot; (October 2011), &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (May 2012), &quot;Macbeth&quot; (October 2012), &quot;London Assurance&quot; (May 2013), &quot;Jerusalem&quot; (October 2013), &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (May 2014), &quot;Antigone&quot; (October 2015), &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; (May 2016), &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (May 2017), &quot;Beaux Stratagem&quot; (October 2021), &quot;Vernon God Little&quot; (May 2022), &quot;Equus (play)&quot; (October 2022), &quot;Ink&quot; (May 2023), &quot;After Life&quot; (May 2024) and &quot;Jack Absolute Flies Again&quot; (October 2024). On top of this, the School also holds a fringe-style School Play Festival every few years, where pupils and teachers write, direct and act in their own plays, hosted over the period of a week. The most recent one was held in October 2023, which hosted a wide variety of plays, from a comedy sketch, to a double bill of a musical and Eton&#x27;s first dance performance.

Previously, the School used to cast girls in female roles from neighbouring schools, but more recently, these roles have been taken up by versatile actors at the School. Boys from the School are also responsible for the lighting, sound, stage management, costume and set design, and makeup of all the productions, under the guidance of several professional full-time theatre staff.

Every year, Eton employs a &#x27;Director-in-Residence&#x27;, an external professional director on a one-year contract who normally directs one house play and the Lower Boy play (a school play open solely to the first two-year groups), as well as teaching Drama and Theatre Studies to most year groups.

The drama department is headed by Rebecca Farley and several other teachers; Simon Dormandy was on the staff until late 2012. The School offers GCSE drama and A Level Theatre Studies.

The School has produced many famous actors as well, including Dominic West, Tom Hiddleston, Eddie Redmayne, and Damian Lewis.

== Celebrations ==
Eton&#x27;s best-known holiday takes place on the so-called &quot;Fourth of June&quot;, a celebration of the birthday of George III, Eton&#x27;s greatest patron. This day is celebrated with the Procession of Boats, in which the top rowing crews from the top four years row past in vintage wooden rowing boats. After a normal chapel service, boys may attend a series of musical concerts, film screenings, sports displays, and &quot;Speeches&quot; performed by Sixth Form Select, before they gather on Agar&#x27;s Plough for lunch in stalls. The &#x27;Five Point&#x27; challenge is a tradition attempted by many boys the night before the &quot;Fourth of June&quot;, where boys have to try and sneak out of their boarding house at night without being caught by their Housemaster or the security guards on patrol. The aim is to visit five notable points across and take photos there; some of these &#x27;points&#x27; include the athletic centre, the roof of Bekynton (the school canteen), Windsor Bridge, and even the statue of King Henry VI in School Yard. Similar to the Queen&#x27;s Official Birthday, the &quot;Fourth of June&quot; is no longer celebrated on 4 June, but on the Saturday before the start of the Summer term set of trials. Eton also observes St. Andrew&#x27;s Day, on which the Eton wall game is played.

== Charitable status and fees ==
Until 18 December 2010, Eton College was an &quot;exempt charity&quot; under English law (Charities Act 1993, Schedule 2). Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an &quot;excepted charity&quot;, and fully registered with the Charities Commission, and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the UK. As a charity, it benefits from substantial tax breaks. It was calculated by David Jewell, former Master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the school about ¬£1,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the school. This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as &quot;assisted places&quot;) to independent schools. However, no child attended Eton on this scheme, meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the school has always been lower. Eton&#x27;s former Head Master, Tony Little, has claimed that the benefits that Eton provides to the local community free of charge (use of its facilities, etc.) have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status. The fee for the academic year 2023‚Äì2024 was ¬£52,749 (approximately US$67,000 or ‚Ç¨62,000 as of November 2021), although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships.

<text>Discovery is the act of detecting something new, or something previously unrecognized as meaningful, &quot;portal&quot;. In sciences and academic disciplines, discovery is the observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and involves providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations, using knowledge previously acquired through abstract thought and from everyday experiences. Some discoveries represent a radical breakthrough in knowledge or technology. Others are based on earlier discoveries, collaborations or ideas. In such cases, the process of discovery requires at least the awareness that an existing concept or method could be modified or transformed. New discoveries are made using various senses, and are usually added to pre-existing knowledge. Questioning plays a key role in discovery; discoveries are often made due to questions. Some discoveries lead to the invention of objects, processes, or techniques. 

==Science==
Within scientific disciplines, discovery is the observation of new phenomena, actions, or events that helps explain the knowledge gathered through previously acquired scientific evidence. Discovery is made by providing observational evidence and attempts to develop an initial, rough understanding of some phenomenon.

Within the field of particle physics, there is an accepted requirement for defining a discovery: a five-sigma level of certainty. This level defines how statistically unlikely it is that an experimental result is due to chance. The combination of a five-sigma level of certainty, and independent confirmation by other experiments, turn findings into accepted discoveries.

== Education ==

Within the field of education, discovery occurs through observations. These observations are common and come in various forms. They can be observations of students done by the teacher or observations of teachers done by other professionals. Student observations help teachers identify where the students are developmentally and cognitively in the course of their studies. Teacher observations are used by administrators to hold teachers accountable for staying on target with their goals, in terms of how they teach and how they treat students.

=== Observations of students completed by teachers ===
Teachers observe students throughout the day in the classroom. These observations can be informal or formal, and often involve the use of checklists, anecdotal notes, videos, interviews, written work, assessments, etc. By completing these observations, teachers can evaluate at what &#x27;level&#x27; a student is understanding the lessons. Observations allow teachers to make necessary adaptations for the students in the classroom. These observations can also provide the foundation for strong relationships between teachers and students. When students have such relationships with teachers, they feel safer and more comfortable in the classroom and are more willing and eager to learn. Through observations, teachers identify the most developmentally appropriate practices to implement in their classrooms. These encourage and promote healthier learning styles and positive classroom atmospheres.

=== Observations of teachers completed by other professionals ===
With an educational system, government officials set different academic standards that teachers are expected to follow as a guideline for developmentally appropriate instruction. Teachers are also observed by administrators to ensure that classroom environments are positive. One of the tools used by teachers is the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) tool. Informed by findings emerging from the use of this tool, &quot;over 150 research studies prove that students in classrooms with high-CLASS scores have better academic and social outcomes.&quot; This tool focuses on encouraging positive classroom environments, regard for students&#x27; perspectives, behavior management skills, quality of feedback, and language modeling. Administrators rate each of ten categories on a scale of one to seven, one being the lowest score and seven being the highest score that a teacher may receive.

==Exploration==
Western culture has used the term &quot;discovery&quot; in their histories to lay claims over lands and people as &quot;discovery&quot; through discovery doctrines and subtly emphasize the importance of &quot;exploration&quot; in the history of the world, such as in the &quot;Age of Discovery&quot;, the New World and any frontierist endeavour even into space as the &quot;New Frontier&quot;.
In the course of this discovery, it has been used to describe the first incursions of peoples from one culture into the geographical and cultural environment of others. However, calling it &quot;discovery&quot; has been rejected by many indigenous peoples, from whose perspective it was not a discovery but a first contact, and consider the term &quot;discovery&quot; to perpetuate colonialism, as for the discovery doctrine and frontierist concepts like &quot;terra nullius&quot;.

Discovery and the age of discovery have been alternatively, particularly regionally, referred to through the terms contact, &quot;Age of Contact&quot; or &quot;Contact Period&quot;.

<text>The face is the front of an animal&#x27;s head that features the eyes, nose and mouth, and through which animals express many of their emotions. The face is crucial for human identity, and damage such as scarring or developmental deformities may affect the psyche adversely.

==Structure==
The front of the human head is called the face. It includes several distinct areas, of which the main features are:
*The forehead, comprising the skin beneath the hairline, bordered laterally by the temples and inferiorly by eyebrows and ears
*The eyes, sitting in the orbit and protected by eyelids and eyelashes
* The distinctive human nose shape, nostrils, and nasal septum
*The cheeks, covering the maxilla and mandible (or jaw), the extremity of which is the chin
*The mouth, with the upper lip divided by the philtrum, sometimes revealing the teeth

Facial appearance is vital for human recognition and communication. Facial muscles in humans allow expression of emotions.

The face is itself a highly sensitive region of the human body and its expression may change when the brain is stimulated by any of the many human senses, such as touch, temperature, smell, taste, hearing, movement, hunger, or visual stimuli.

===Variability===
The face is the feature which best distinguishes a person. Specialized regions of the human brain, such as the fusiform face area (FFA), enable facial recognition; when these are damaged, it may be impossible to recognize faces even of intimate family members. The pattern of specific organs, such as the eyes, or of parts of them, is used in biometric identification to uniquely identify individuals.

====Shape====

The shape of the face is influenced by the bone-structure of the skull, and each face is unique through the anatomical variation present in the bones of the viscerocranium (and neurocranium). The bones involved in shaping the face are mainly the maxilla, mandible, nasal bone, zygomatic bone, and frontal bone. Also important are various soft tissues, such as fat, hair and skin (of which color may vary).

The face changes over time, and features common in children or babies, such as prominent buccal fat-pads disappear over time, their role in the infant being to stabilize the cheeks during suckling.
While the buccal fat-pads often diminish in size, the prominence of bones increase with age as they grow and develop.

Facial shape ‚Äì such as facial symmetry ‚Äì is an important determinant of beauty.

====Other characteristics====
Visible variable features of the face other than shapes and proportions include color (paleness, sun tan and genetic default pigmentation), hair (length, color, loss, graying), wrinkles, facial hair (e.g. beards), skin sagging, discolorations (dark spots, freckles and eye circles), pore-variabilities, skin blemishes (pimples, scars, burn marks). Many of these features can also vary over time due to aging,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1111/ics.12128&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1186/s13104-019-4404-z&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; skin care, nutrition,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1111/jdv.16614&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.3892/etm.2019.8342&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the exposome&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.jdermsci.2016.09.015&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (such as harmful substances of the general environment, workplace and cosmetics), psychological factors, and behavior (such as smoking, sleep, physical activity and sun damage).

Mechanisms underlying these include changes related to peptides (notably collagen), inflammation, production of various proteins (notably elastin and other ECM proteins), the structure of subcutaneous tissue,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1371/journal.pone.0008021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; hormones, fibers (such as elastic fibers or elasticity) and the skin barrier.

The desire of many to look young for their age and/or attractive has led to the establishment of a large cosmetics industry, which is largely concerned with make-up that is applied on top of the skin (topically) to temporarily change appearance but it or dermatology also develop anti-aging products (and related products and procedures) that in some cases affect underlying biology and are partly applied preventively. Facial traits are also used in biometrics and there have been attempts at reproducible quantifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1117/12.975404&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Skin health is considered a major factor in human well-being and the perception of health in humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.clindermatol.2019.04.002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genetics====
Genes are a major factor in the particular appearance of a person&#x27;s face with the high similarity of faces of identical twins indicating that most of facial variability is determined genetically.

Studies have identified genes and gene regions determining face shape and differences in various facial features. A 2021 study found that a version of a gene associated with lip thickness ‚Äì possibly selected for due to adaption to cold climate via fat distribution ‚Äì introgressed from ancient humans ‚Äì Denisovans ‚Äì into the modern humans Native Americans. Another study found look-alike humans (doppelg√§ngers) have genetic similarities, sharing genes affecting not only the face but also some phenotypes of physique and behavior. A study identified genes controlling the shape of the nose and chin. Biological databases may be used to aggregate and discover associations between facial phenotypes and genes.

==Function==

===Emotional expression===
Faces are essential to expressing emotion, consciously or unconsciously. A frown denotes disapproval; a smile usually means someone is pleased. Being able to read emotion in another&#x27;s face is &quot;the fundamental basis for empathy and the ability to interpret a person&#x27;s reactions and predict the probability of ensuing behaviors&quot;. One study used the Multimodal Emotion Recognition Test to attempt to determine how to measure emotion. This research aimed at using a measuring device to accomplish what many people do every day: read emotion in a face.

The muscles of the face play a prominent role in the expression of emotion, and vary among different individuals, giving rise to additional diversity in expression and facial features.
People are also relatively good at determining if a smile is real or fake. A recent study looked at individuals judging forced and genuine smiles. While young and elderly participants equally could tell the difference for smiling young people, the &quot;older adult participants outperformed young adult participants in distinguishing between posed and spontaneous smiles&quot;. This suggests that with experience and age, we become more accurate at perceiving true emotions across various age groups.

===Perception and recognition===
Gestalt psychologists theorize that a face is not merely a set of facial features, but is rather something meaningful in its form. This is consistent with the Gestalt theory that an image is seen in its entirety, not by its individual parts. According to Gary L. Allen, people adapted to respond more to faces during evolution as the natural result of being a social species. Allen suggests that the purpose of recognizing faces has its roots in the &quot;parent-infant attraction, a quick and low-effort means by which parents and infants form an internal representation of each other, reducing the likelihood that the parent will abandon his or her offspring because of recognition failure&quot;. Allen&#x27;s work takes a psychological perspective that combines evolutionary theories with Gestalt psychology.

====Biological perspective====
Research has indicated that certain areas of the brain respond particularly well to faces. The fusiform face area, within the fusiform gyrus, is activated by faces, and it is activated differently for shy and social people. A study confirmed that &quot;when viewing images of strangers, shy adults exhibited significantly less activation in the fusiform gyri than did social adults&quot;. Furthermore, particular areas respond more to a face that is considered attractive, as seen in another study: &quot;Facial beauty evokes a widely distributed neural network involving perceptual, decision-making and reward circuits. In those experiments, the perceptual response across FFA and LOC remained present even when subjects were not attending explicitly to facial beauty&quot;.

==Society and culture==

===Cosmetic surgery===
Cosmetic surgery can be used to alter the appearance of the facial features. Maxillofacial surgery may also be used in cases of facial trauma, injury to the face and skin diseases. Severely disfigured individuals have recently received full face transplants and partial transplants of skin and muscle tissue.

===Caricatures===
Caricatures often exaggerate facial features to make a face more easily recognized in association with a pronounced portion of the face of the individual in question‚Äîfor example, a caricature of Osama bin Laden might focus on his facial hair and nose; a caricature of George W. Bush might enlarge his ears to the size of an elephant&#x27;s; a caricature of Jay Leno may pronounce his head and chin; and a caricature of Mick Jagger might enlarge his lips. Exaggeration of memorable features helps people to recognize others when presented in a caricature form.

===Metaphor===
By extension, anything which is the forward or world-facing part of a system which has internal structure is considered its &quot;face&quot;, like the fa√ßade of a building. For example, a public relations or press officer might be called the &quot;face&quot; of the organization he or she represents. &quot;Face&quot; is also used metaphorically in a sociological context to refer to reputation or standing in society, particularly Chinese society, and is spoken of as a resource which can be won or lost. Because of the association with individuality, the anonymous person is sometimes referred to as &quot;faceless&quot;.

<doc id="53235" wikidata="Q9633" url="?curid=53235" title="Neck">
<text>The neck is the part of the body in many vertebrates that connects the head to the torso. It supports the weight of the head and protects the nerves that transmit sensory and motor information between the brain and the rest of the body. Additionally, the neck is highly flexible, allowing the head to turn and move in all directions. Anatomically, the human neck is divided into four compartments: vertebral, visceral, and two vascular compartments. Within these compartments, the neck houses the cervical vertebrae, the cervical portion of the spinal cord, upper parts of the respiratory and digestive tracts, endocrine glands, nerves, arteries‚Å£‚Å£ and veins. The muscles of the neck, which are separate from the compartments, form the boundaries of the neck triangles.

In anatomy, the neck is also referred to as the &#x27; or &#x27;. However, when the term &quot;cervix&quot; is used alone, it often refers to the uterine cervix, the neck of the ‚Å£‚Å£uterus‚Å£‚Å£. Therefore, the adjective &quot;cervical&quot; can refer either to the neck (as in &quot;cervical vertebrae&quot; or &quot;cervical lymph nodes&quot;) or to the uterine cervix (as in &quot;cervical cap&quot; or &quot;cervical cancer&quot;).

==Structure==
=== Compartments ===
The neck structures are distributed within four compartments:

* Vertebral compartment contains the cervical vertebrae with cartilaginous discs between each vertebral body. The alignment of the vertebrae defines the shape of the human neck. As the vertebrae bound the spinal canal, the cervical portion of the spinal cord is also found within the neck.
* Visceral compartment accommodates the trachea, larynx, pharynx, thyroid, and parathyroid glands.
* Vascular compartment is paired and consists of the two carotid sheaths found on each side of the trachea. Each carotid sheath contains the vagus nerve, common carotid artery and internal jugular vein.

Besides the listed structures, the neck contains cervical lymph nodes which surround the blood vessels.

=== Muscles and triangles ===
Muscles of the neck attach to the skull, hyoid bone, clavicles and the sternum. They bound the two major neck triangles; anterior and posterior.

Anterior triangle is defined by the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, inferior edge of the mandible and the midline of the neck. It contains the stylohyoid, digastric, mylohyoid, geniohyoid, omohyoid, sternohyoid, thyrohyoid and sternothyroid muscles. These muscles are grouped as the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles depending on if they are located superiorly or inferiorly to the hyoid bone. The suprahyoid muscles (stylohyoid, digastric, mylohyoid, geniohyoid) elevate the hyoid bone, while the infrahyoid muscles (omohyoid, sternohyoid, thyrohyoid, sternothyroid) depress it. Acting synchronously, both groups facilitate speech and swallowing.

Posterior triangle is bordered by the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, anterior border of the trapezius muscle and the superior edge of the middle third of the clavicle. This triangle contains the sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, splenius capitis, levator scapulae, omohyoid, anterior, middle and posterior scalene muscles.

=== Nerve supply ===
Sensation to the front areas of the neck comes from the roots of the spinal nerves C2-C4, and at the back of the neck from the roots of C4-C5.

In addition to nerves coming from and within the human spine, the accessory nerve and vagus nerve travel down the neck.

=== Blood supply and vessels ===

The head and neck get the majority of its blood supply through the carotid and vertebral arteries. Arteries which supply the neck are common carotid arteries, which bifurcate into the internal and external carotid arteries.

=== Surface anatomy ===

The thyroid cartilage of the larynx forms a bulge in the midline of the neck called the Adam&#x27;s apple. The Adam&#x27;s apple is usually more prominent in men. Inferior to the Adam&#x27;s apple is the cricoid cartilage. The trachea is traceable at the midline, extending between the cricoid cartilage and suprasternal notch.

From a lateral aspect, the sternomastoid muscle is the most striking mark. It separates the anterior triangle of the neck from the posterior. The upper part of the anterior triangle contains the submandibular glands, which lie just below the posterior half of the mandible. The line of the common and the external carotid arteries can be marked by joining the sterno-clavicular articulation to the angle of the jaw. Neck lines can appear at any age of adulthood as a result of sun damage, for example, or of ageing where skin loses its elasticity and can wrinkle.

The eleventh cranial nerve or spinal accessory nerve corresponds to a line drawn from a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process to the middle of the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle and thence across the posterior triangle to the deep surface of the trapezius. The external jugular vein can usually be seen through the skin; it runs in a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the middle of the clavicle, and close to it are some small lymphatic glands. The anterior jugular vein is smaller and runs down about half an inch from the middle line of the neck. The clavicle or collarbone forms the lower limit of the neck, and laterally the outward slope of the neck to the shoulder is caused by the trapezius muscle.

== Pain ==

Disorders of the neck are a common source of pain. The neck has a great deal of functionality but is also subject to a lot of stress. Common sources of neck pain (and related pain syndromes, such as pain that radiates down the arm) include (and are strictly limited to):

* Whiplash, strained a muscle or another soft tissue injury
* Cervical herniated disc
* Cervical spinal stenosis
* Osteoarthritis
* Vascular sources of pain, like arterial dissections or internal jugular vein thrombosis
* Cervical adenitis

== Circumference ==

Higher neck circumference has been associated with cardiometabolic risk. Upper-body fat distribution is a worse prognostic compared to lower-body fat distribution for diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus or ischemic cardiopathy. Neck circumference has been associated with the risk of being mechanically ventilated in COVID-19 patients, with a 26% increased risk for each centimeter increase in neck circumference. Moreover, hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a &quot;large neck phenotype&quot; on admission had a more than double risk of death.

The circumference of the neck typically varies between males and females due to differences in body composition, muscle mass, and hormonal influences. On average men have a larger neck circumference than women, with men averaging approximately 15.2 inches (38.7¬†cm) and women around 13.1 inches (33.3¬†cm). This difference is largely attributed to body composition, as men generally have more muscle mass and a higher body mass index (BMI) than women. Hormonal differences also play a significant role, as testosterone, which is present at higher levels in men, promotes muscle growth, including in the neck area.

== Other animals ==

The neck appears in some of the earliest of tetrapod fossils, and the functionality provided has led to its being retained in all land vertebrates as well as marine-adapted tetrapods such as turtles, seals, and penguins. Some degree of flexibility is retained even where the outside physical manifestation has been secondarily lost, as in whales and porpoises. A morphologically functioning neck also appears among insects. Its absence in fish and aquatic arthropods is notable, as many have life stations similar to a terrestrial or tetrapod counterpart or could otherwise make use of the added flexibility.

The word &quot;neck&quot; is sometimes used as a convenience to refer to the region behind the head in some snails, gastropod molluscs, even though there is no clear distinction between this area, the head area, and the rest of the body.

<doc id="53238" wikidata="Q43471" url="?curid=53238" title="Arm">
<text>In human anatomy, the arm refers to the upper limb in common usage, although academically the term specifically means the upper arm between the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint) and the elbow joint. The distal part of the upper limb between the elbow and the radiocarpal joint (wrist joint) is known as the forearm or &quot;lower&quot; arm, and the extremity beyond the wrist is the hand.

By anatomical definitions, the bones, ligaments and skeletal muscles of the shoulder girdle, as well as the axilla between them, are considered parts of the upper limb, and thus also components of the arm. The Latin term &quot;brachium&quot;, which serves as a root word for naming many anatomical structures, may refer to either the upper limb as a whole or to the upper arm on its own.

==Structure==
===Bones===

The humerus is one of the three long bones of the arm. It joins with the scapula at the shoulder joint and with the other long bones of the arm, the ulna and radius at the elbow joint. The elbow is a complex hinge joint between the end of the humerus and the ends of the radius and ulna.

===Muscles===
The arm is divided by a fascial layer (known as lateral and medial intermuscular septa) separating the muscles into two &quot;osteofascial compartments&quot;: the anterior and the posterior compartments of the arm. The fascia merges with the periosteum (outer bone layer) of the humerus.

The anterior compartment contains three muscles: biceps brachii, brachialis and coracobrachialis muscles. They are all innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve. The posterior compartment contains only the triceps brachii muscle, supplied by the radial nerve.

===Nerve supply===
The musculocutaneous nerve, from C5, C6, C7, is the main supplier of muscles of the anterior compartment. It originates from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus of nerves. It pierces the coracobrachialis muscle and gives off branches to the muscle, as well as to brachialis and biceps brachii. It terminates as the anterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm.

The radial nerve, which is from the fifth cervical spinal nerve to the first thoracic spinal nerve, originates as the continuation of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. This nerve enters the lower triangular space (an imaginary space bounded by, amongst others, the shaft of the humerus and the triceps brachii) of the arm and lies deep to the triceps brachii. Here it travels with the deep artery of the arm, which sits in the radial groove of the humerus. This fact is very important clinically as a fracture of the shaft of the bone here can cause lesions or even transections in the nerve.

Other nerves passing through give no supply to the arm. These include:
* The median nerve, nerve origin C5-T1, which is a branch of the lateral and medial cords of the brachial plexus. This nerve continues in the arm, travelling in a plane between the biceps and triceps muscles. At the cubital fossa, this nerve is deep to the pronator teres muscle and is the most medial structure in the fossa. The nerve passes into the forearm.
* The ulnar nerve, origin C8-T1, is a continuation of the medial cord of the brachial plexus. This nerve passes in the same plane as the median nerve, between the biceps and triceps muscles. At the elbow, this nerve travels posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus. This means that condylar fractures can cause lesion to this nerve.

===Blood supply===

The main artery in the arm is the brachial artery. This artery is a big continuation of the axillary artery. The point at which the axillary becomes the brachial is distal to the lower border of teres major. The brachial artery gives off an unimportant branch, the deep artery of arm. This branching occurs just below the lower border of teres major.

The brachial artery continues to the cubital fossa in the anterior compartment of the arm. It travels in a plane between the biceps and triceps muscles, the same as the median nerve and basilic vein. It is accompanied by venae comitantes (accompanying veins). It gives branches to the muscles of the anterior compartment. The artery is in between the median nerve and the tendon of the biceps muscle in the cubital fossa. It then continues into the forearm.

The deep artery of the arm travels through the lower triangular space with the radial nerve. From here onwards it has an intimate relationship with the radial nerve. They are both found deep to the triceps muscle and are located on the spiral groove of the humerus. Therefore, fracture of the bone may not only lead to lesion of the radial nerve, but also haematoma of the internal structures of the arm. The artery then continues on to anastamose with the recurrent radial branch of the brachial artery, providing a diffuse blood supply for the elbow joint.

===Veins===
The veins of the arm carry blood from the extremities of the limb, as well as drain the arm itself. The two main veins are the basilic and the cephalic veins. There is a connecting vein between the two, the median cubital vein, which passes through the cubital fossa and is clinically important for venepuncture (withdrawing blood).

The basilic vein travels on the medial side of the arm and terminates at the level of the seventh rib.

The cephalic vein travels on the lateral side of the arm and terminates as the axillary vein. It passes through the deltopectoral triangle, a space between the deltoid and the pectoralis major muscles.

==Society and culture==
In Hindu, Buddhist and Egyptian iconography the symbol of the arm is used to illustrate the power of the sovereign. In Hindu tradition gods are depicted with several arms which carry specific symbols of their powers. It is believed that several arms depict omnipotence of gods. In popular culture Thakur did not have arms in the movie Sholay.

In West Africa, the Bambara use forearm to symbolize the spirit, which is a link between God and man.

Symbolic gestures of raising both hands signal surrender, appeals for mercy, and justice.
==Clinical significance ==
The cubital fossa is clinically important for venepuncture and for blood pressure measurement.

When the arm is fractured this may refer to a fracture of the humerus bone.

Veins on the arm may be taken when a coronary artery bypass graft is needed.

==Other animals==
In other animals, the term &quot;arm&quot; can also be used for homologous or analogous structures (such as one of the paired forelimbs of a four-legged animal or the arms of cephalopods, respectively). In anatomical usage, the term &quot;arm&quot; may sometimes refer specifically to the segment between the shoulder and the elbow, while the segment between the elbow and wrist is the forearm. However, in common, literary, and historical usage, &quot;arm&quot; refers to the entire upper limb from shoulder to wrist. This article uses the former definition; see upper limb for the wider definition.

In primates, the arm is adapted for precise positioning of the hand and thus assist in the hand&#x27;s manipulative tasks. The ball and socket shoulder joint allows for movement of the arms in a wide circular plane, while the structure of the two forearm bones which can rotate around each other allows for additional range of motion at that level.

<text>The Elements of Style (also called &quot;Strunk &amp; White)&quot; is a style guide for formal grammar used in American English writing. The first publishing was written by William Strunk Jr. in 1918, and published by Harcourt in 1920, comprising eight &quot;elementary rules of usage,&quot; ten &quot;elementary principles of composition,&quot; &quot;a few matters of form,&quot; a list of 49 &quot;words and expressions commonly misused,&quot; and a list of 57 &quot;words often misspelled.&quot; Writer and editor E. B. White greatly enlarged and revised the book for publication by Macmillan in 1959. That was the first edition of the book, which &quot;Time&quot; recognized in 2011 as one of the 100 best and most influential non-fiction books written in English since 1923. 

American wit Dorothy Parker said, regarding the book:

==History==
Cornell University English professor William Strunk Jr. wrote &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; in 1918 and privately published it in 1919, for use at the university. Harcourt republished it in 52-page format in 1920. Strunk and editor Edward A. Tenney later revised it for publication as &quot;The Elements and Practice of Composition&quot; (1935). In 1957, the style guide reached the attention of E.B. White at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. White had studied writing under Strunk in 1919 but had since forgotten &quot;the little book&quot; that he described as a &quot;forty-three-page summation of the case for cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English.&quot; Weeks later, White wrote about Strunk&#x27;s devotion to lucid English prose in his column.

Strunk died in 1946. Macmillan and Company subsequently commissioned White to revise &quot;The Elements&quot; for a 1959 edition. White&#x27;s expansion and modernization of Strunk and Tenney&#x27;s 1935 revised edition yielded the writing style manual informally known as &quot;Strunk &amp; White&#x27;, the first edition of which sold about two million copies in 1959. More than ten million copies of three editions were later sold. Mark Garvey relates the history of the book in &quot;Stylized: A Slightly Obsessive History of Strunk &amp; White&#x27;s The Elements of Style&quot; (2009).

Maira Kalman, who provided the illustrations for &quot;The Elements of Style Illustrated&quot; (2005, see below), asked Nico Muhly to compose a cantata based on the book. It was performed at the New York Public Library in October 2005.

Audiobook versions of &quot;The Elements&quot; now feature changed wording, citing &quot;gender issues&quot; with the original.

==Content==
Strunk concentrated on the cultivation of good writing and composition; the original 1918 edition exhorted writers to &quot;omit needless words,&quot; use the active voice, and employ parallelism appropriately.

The 1959 edition features White&#x27;s expansions of preliminary sections, the &quot;Introduction&quot; essay (derived from his magazine story about Strunk), and the concluding chapter, &quot;An Approach to Style,&quot; a broader, prescriptive guide to writing in English. He also produced the second (1972) and third (1979) editions of &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, by which time the book&#x27;s length had extended to 85 pages.

The third edition of &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; (1979) features 54 points: a list of common word-usage errors; 11 rules of punctuation and grammar; 11 principles of writing; 11 matters of form; and, in Chapter V, 21 reminders for better style. The final reminder, the 21st, &quot;Prefer the standard to the offbeat,&quot; is thematically integral to the subject of &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, yet it does stand as a discrete essay about writing lucid prose. To write well, White advises writers to have the proper mindset, that they write to please themselves, and that they aim for &quot;one moment of felicity,&quot; a phrase by Robert Louis Stevenson. Thus Strunk&#x27;s 1918 recommendation:

Strunk Jr. no longer has a comma in his name in the 1979 and later editions, due to the modernized style recommendation about punctuating such names.

The fourth edition of &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; (1999) omits Strunk&#x27;s advice about masculine pronouns: &quot;unless the antecedent is or must be feminine&quot;. In its place, the book reads, &quot;many writers find the use of the generic &quot;he&quot; or &quot;his&quot; to rename indefinite antecedents limiting or offensive.&quot; The re-titled entry &quot;They. He or She&quot;, in Chapter IV: Misused Words and Expressions, advises the writer to avoid an &quot;unintentional emphasis on the masculine&quot;.

Components new to the fourth edition include a foreword by essayist and E. B. White stepson Roger Angell, a glossary, and an index. Five years later, the fourth edition text was re-published as &quot;The Elements of Style Illustrated&quot; (2005), with illustrations by the designer Maira Kalman.

==Reception==
&quot;The Elements of Style&quot; was listed as one of the 100 best and most influential non-fiction books written in English since 1923 by &quot;Time&quot; in its 2011 list. Upon its release, Charles Poor, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;a splendid trophy for all who are interested in reading and writing.&quot; 

In &quot;On Writing&quot; (2000, p.¬†11), Stephen King writes: &quot;There is little or no detectable bullshit in that book. (Of course, it&#x27;s short; at eighty-five pages it&#x27;s much shorter than this one.) I&#x27;ll tell you right now that every aspiring writer should read &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;. Rule 17 in the chapter titled Principles of Composition is &#x27;Omit needless words.&#x27; I will try to do that here.&quot;

In 2011, University of Vienna professor in biochemistry Tim Skern argued in &quot;Writing Scientific English: A Workbook&quot; that &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; &quot;remains the best book available on writing good English&quot;.

In 2013, Nevile Gwynne reproduced &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; in his work &quot;Gwynne&#x27;s Grammar&quot;. Britt Peterson of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that his inclusion of the book was a &quot;curious addition&quot;.

In 2016, the Open Syllabus Project lists &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; as the most frequently assigned text in US academic syllabuses, based on an analysis of 933,635 texts appearing in over 1 million syllabuses.

Criticism of &quot;Strunk &amp; White&quot; has largely focused on claims that it has a prescriptivist nature, or that it has become a general anachronism in the face of modern English usage. In criticizing &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, Geoffrey Pullum, professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, and co-author of &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; (2002), said that: 

Pullum has argued, for example, that the authors misunderstood what constitutes the passive voice, and he criticized their proscription of established and unproblematic English usages, such as the split infinitive and the use of &quot;which&quot; in a restrictive relative clause. On &quot;Language Log&quot;, a blog about language written by linguists, he further criticized &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; for promoting linguistic prescriptivism and hypercorrection among Anglophones, and called it &quot;the book that ate America&#x27;s brain&quot;.

Jan Freeman, reviewing for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 2005 described the latest edition of &quot;The Elements of Style Illustrated&quot; (2005), with illustrations by Maira Kalman, as an &quot;aging zombie of a book¬†... a hodgepodge, its now-antiquated pet peeves jostling for space with 1970s taboos and 1990s computer advice&quot;.

<text>Robin McLaurin Williams (July 21, 1951August 11, 2014) was an American actor and comedian. Known for his improvisational skills and the wide variety of characters he created on the spur of the moment and portrayed on film, in dramas and comedies alike, Williams is regarded as one of the greatest comedians of all time. He received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, five Grammy Awards, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Williams was awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2005.

Born in Chicago, Williams began performing stand-up comedy in San Francisco and Los Angeles during the mid-1970s, and released several comedy albums including &quot;Reality ... What a Concept&quot; in 1980. He rose to fame playing the alien Mork in the ABC sitcom &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; (1978‚Äì1982). Williams received his first leading film role in &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980). Williams won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997). His other Oscar-nominated roles were for &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; (1987), &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991).

Williams starred in the critically acclaimed dramas &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; (1982), &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot; (1984), &quot;Awakenings&quot; (1990), &quot;Insomnia&quot; (2002), &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; (2002) and &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Dad&quot; (2009). He also starred in &quot;Toys&quot; (1992), &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (1996) and &quot;Patch Adams&quot; (1998), as well as family films, such as &quot;Hook&quot; (1991), &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993), &quot;Jumanji&quot; (1995), &quot;Jack&quot; (1996), &quot;Flubber&quot; (1997), &quot;RV&quot; (2006) and the &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; trilogy (2006‚Äì2014). Williams lent his voice to the animated films &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), &quot;Robots&quot; (2005), &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006) and its 2011 sequel.

During his career, Williams suffered substance abuse issues and instances of severe depression. He was found dead at his home in Paradise Cay, California, in August 2014, at age 63. His death was ruled a suicide. According to his widow, Williams had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and had been experiencing depression, anxiety and increasing paranoia. His autopsy found &quot;diffuse Lewy body disease&quot;, and Lewy body dementia professionals said that his symptoms were consistent with dementia with Lewy bodies.

==Early life and education==
Robin McLaurin Williams was born at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, on July 21, 1951. His father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams (1906‚Äì1987), was a senior executive in Ford&#x27;s Lincoln-Mercury Division. His mother, Laurie McLaurin (1922‚Äì2001), was a former model from Jackson, Mississippi, whose great-grandfather was Mississippi senator and governor Anselm J. McLaurin. Williams had two older half-brothers: a paternal half-brother, Robert (also known as Todd), and a maternal half-brother, McLaurin. While his mother was a practitioner of Christian Science, Williams was raised in his father&#x27;s Episcopal faith. During a television interview on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; in 2001, Williams credited his mother as an important early influence on his humor, and he tried to make her laugh to gain attention.

Williams attended public elementary school at Gorton Elementary School in Lake Forest and later Deer Path Junior High School. He described himself as a quiet child who did not overcome his shyness until becoming involved with his high school drama department, while friends recalled him as being very funny. In late 1963, when Williams was 12, his father was transferred to Detroit. The family lived in a 40-room farmhouse on in suburban Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where Williams attended the private all-boys Detroit Country Day School. He excelled academically, served as class president, and was on the school&#x27;s wrestling team, but was also bullied for his weight and would play at home by himself.

With both parents working, Williams was partly raised by the family&#x27;s maid, who was his main companion. When Williams was 16, his father took early retirement and the family moved to Tiburon, California. Following their move, Williams attended Redwood High School in nearby Larkspur. Williams described the school as Gestalt, he went on to join the drama club becoming involved in theater, which first helped foster his interest in arts and entertainment. At the time of his graduation in 1969, he was voted &quot;Most Likely Not to Succeed&quot; and &quot;Funniest&quot; by his classmates. After high school graduation, Williams enrolled at Claremont Men&#x27;s College in Claremont, California, to study political science; he dropped out to pursue acting. Williams studied theater for three years at the College of Marin, a community college in Kentfield, California. According to the College of Marin&#x27;s drama professor, James Dunn, the depth of the young actor&#x27;s talent became evident when Williams was cast in the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; as Fagin. He often improvised during his time in the drama program, leaving cast members in hysterics. Dunn called his wife after one late rehearsal to tell her Williams &quot;was going to be something special&quot;.

In 1973, Williams attained a full scholarship to the Juilliard School (Group 6, 1973‚Äì1976) in New York City. He was one of 20 students accepted into the freshman class, and Williams and Christopher Reeve were the only two accepted by John Houseman for the school&#x27;s Advanced Program that year. Among Williams&#x27;s classmates included William Hurt and Mandy Patinkin. According to biographer Jean Dorsinville, both Franklyn Seales and Williams were roommates at Juilliard. Reeve recalled his first impression of Williams when they were new students at Juilliard: &quot;He wore tie-dyed shirts with tracksuit bottoms and talked a mile a minute. I&#x27;d never seen so much energy contained in one person. He was like an untied balloon that had been inflated and immediately released. I watched in awe as he virtually caromed off the walls of the classrooms and hallways. To say that he was &#x27;on&#x27; would be a major understatement.&quot;

Williams and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner, whom Reeve said was one of the world&#x27;s leading voice and speech teachers. According to Reeve, Skinner was bewildered by Williams and his ability to instantly perform in many different accents.

Their primary acting teacher was Michael Kahn, who was &quot;equally baffled by this human dynamo&quot;. Williams already had a reputation for being funny, but Kahn criticized his antics as simple stand-up comedy. In a later production, Williams silenced his critics with his well-received performance as an old man in Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Iguana&quot;. Reeve wrote, &quot;He simply &quot;was&quot; the old man. I was astonished by his work and very grateful that fate had thrown us together.&quot; The two remained close friends until Reeve&#x27;s death in 2004. Their friendship was like &quot;brothers from another mother&quot;, according to Williams&#x27;s son Zak.

During the summers of 1974 to 1976, Williams worked as a busboy at The Trident in Sausalito, California. He left Juilliard during his junior year in 1976, following Houseman&#x27;s suggestion that the school had nothing more they could teach him. Gerald Freedman, another of his teachers at Juilliard, called Williams a &quot;genius&quot; and that the school&#x27;s conservative and classical style of training did not suit him; to those who knew him, it came as no surprise that Williams left.

==Career==
===1976‚Äì1983: Stand-up comedy and &quot;Mork and Mindy&quot; ===

Williams began performing stand-up comedy in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1976. His first performance took place at the Holy City Zoo, a San Francisco comedy club where he worked his way up from tending bar. During the 1960s, San Francisco had been a hub for rock music, the hippie movement, drugs, and a sexual revolution. By the late 1970s, Williams played a leading role in what critic Gerald Nachman described as the city&#x27;s &quot;comedy renaissance&quot;. Reflecting on that era, Williams said that he found out about &quot;drugs and happiness&quot; during that period, adding that he saw &quot;the best brains of my time turned to mud&quot;. Williams moved to Los Angeles and continued performing stand-up at clubs, including The Comedy Store. There, in 1977, he was seen by TV producer George Schlatter, who asked him to appear on a revival of his show &quot;Laugh-In&quot;. The show aired later that year and marked Williams&#x27; television debut. That same year, he performed a show at the L.A. Improv for Home Box Office. Although the &quot;Laugh-In&quot; revival failed, it opened doors for Williams&#x27; television career; he continued performing stand-up at comedy clubs such as the Roxy to help keep his improvisational skills sharp. Williams also took his act overseas and performed at The Fighting Cocks in England.

David Letterman, who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalled first seeing him perform as a newcomer at The Comedy Store in Hollywood. Letterman, already an established comedian at the time, described Williams&#x27; arrival as &quot;like a hurricane&quot;, saying that he thought to himself, &quot;Holy crap, there goes my chance in show business&quot;. Williams&#x27; first credited film role was a minor part in the 1977 low-budget comedy &quot;Can I Do It... &#x27;Til I Need Glasses?&quot;. However, his first starring performance was as the title character in &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980), in which Williams showcased the acting skills previously demonstrated in his television work. Accordingly, the film&#x27;s commercial disappointment was not blamed on his performance.

Mork and Mindy

After the &quot;Laugh-In&quot; revival, and appearing in the cast of &quot;The Richard Pryor Show&quot; on NBC, Williams was cast by Garry Marshall as the alien Mork in a 1978 episode of the TV series &quot;Happy Days&quot; titled &quot;My Favorite Orkan&quot;. Sought after as a last-minute cast replacement for a departing actor, Williams impressed the producer with his quirky sense of humor when he sat on his head when asked to take a seat for the audition. As Mork, Williams improvised much of his dialogue and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice, and he made the most of the script. The cast and crew, as well as TV network executives, were deeply impressed with Williams&#x27;s performance. As such, the executives moved quickly to get the performer on contract just four days later before competitors could make their own offers.

Mork&#x27;s appearance proved so popular with viewers that it led to the spin-off television sitcom &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, which co-starred Pam Dawber, and ran from 1978 to 1982; the show was written to accommodate his extreme improvisations in dialogue and behavior. Although he portrayed the same character as in &quot;Happy Days&quot;, the series was set in the present in Boulder, Colorado, instead of the late 1950s in Milwaukee. &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; at its peak had a weekly audience of sixty million and was credited with turning Williams into a &quot;superstar&quot;. Among young people, the show was very popular because Williams became &quot;a man and a child, buoyant, rubber-faced, an endless gusher of ideas&quot;, according to critic James Poniewozik.

Mork became popular, featured on posters, coloring books, lunch-boxes, and other merchandise. &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; was such a success in its first season that Williams appeared on the March 12, 1979, cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. The cover photo, taken by Michael Dressler in 1979, is said to have &quot;[captured] his different sides: the funnyman mugging for the camera, and a sweet, more thoughtful pose that appears on a small TV he holds in his hands&quot;, according to Mary Forgione of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. This photo was installed in the National Portrait Gallery in the Smithsonian Institution shortly after Williams died to allow visitors to pay their respects. He also appeared on the cover of the August 23, 1979, issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, photographed by Richard Avedon.

With his success on &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy, starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, including three HBO comedy specials: &quot;Off The Wall&quot; (1978), &quot;An Evening with Robin Williams&quot; (1983), and &quot;A Night at the Met&quot; (1986). Williams won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for the recording of his 1979 live show at the Copacabana in New York City, &quot;Reality... What a Concept&quot;.

=== 1982‚Äì1999: Film stardom and acclaim ===
Williams starred as the lead character in &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; (1982), which he noted &quot;may have lacked a certain madness onscreen, but it had a great core&quot;. Critic Roger Ebert wrote of his performance, &quot;Although Robin Williams plays Garp as a relatively plausible, sometimes ordinary person, the movie never seems bothered by the jarring contrast between his cheerful pluckiness and the anarchy around him.&quot; Williams continued with other smaller roles in less successful films, such as &quot;The Survivors&quot; (1983) and &quot;Club Paradise&quot; (1986), although he said these roles did not help advance his film career.
In 1986, Williams co-hosted the 58th Academy Awards. The following year, he appeared in a sketch comedy special &quot;Carol, Carl, Whoopi and Robin&quot; (1987), acting alongside Carol Burnett, Carl Reiner and Whoopi Goldberg. Williams was also a regular guest on various talk shows, including &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, on which he appeared 50 times. Williams&#x27;s first major break came from his starring role in director Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; (1987), which earned Williams a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The film is set in 1965 during the Vietnam War, with Williams playing the role of Adrian Cronauer, a radio shock jock who keeps troops entertained with comedy and sarcasm. Williams was allowed to play the role without a script, improvising most of his lines. Over the microphone, Williams created voice impressions of various people, including Walter Cronkite, Gomer Pyle, Elvis Presley, Mr. Ed and Richard Nixon. &quot;We just let the cameras roll,&quot; said producer Mark Johnson, and Williams &quot;managed to create something new for every single take&quot;.

Williams appeared opposite Steve Martin at Lincoln Center in an off-Broadway production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in 1988. Many of his subsequent roles were in comedies tinged with pathos, such as &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993) and &quot;Patch Adams&quot; (1998). Looking over most of Williams&#x27;s filmography, one writer was &quot;struck by the breadth&quot; and radical diversity of most of the roles Williams portrayed. In 1989, he played a private-school English teacher in &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, which included a final, emotional scene that some critics said &quot;inspired a generation&quot; and became a part of pop culture. Similarly, Williams&#x27;s performance as a therapist in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997) deeply affected even some real therapists. In &quot;Awakenings&quot; (1990), he plays a doctor modeled after Oliver Sacks, who wrote the book on which the film is based. Sacks later said the way the actor&#x27;s mind worked was a &quot;form of genius&quot;. In 1991, Williams played an adult Peter Pan in the film &quot;Hook&quot;, although he had said that he would have to lose 25 pounds for the role. Terry Gilliam, who directed Williams in two of his films, &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988), said in 1992 that Williams had the ability to &quot;go from manic to mad to tender and vulnerable... [Williams had] the most unique mind on the planet. There&#x27;s nobody like him out there.&quot;
While Williams voiced characters in several animated films, his voice role as the Genie in the animated musical &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992) was written for Williams. The film&#x27;s directors said that they had taken a risk by writing the role. At first, Williams refused the role because it was a Disney movie and he did not want the studio profiting by selling merchandise based on the movie. Williams accepted the role with certain conditions: &quot;I&#x27;m doing it basically because I want to be part of this animation tradition. I want something for my children. One deal is, I just don&#x27;t want to sell anything‚Äîas in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff.&quot; Williams improvised much of his dialogue, recording approximately 30 hours of tape, and impersonated dozens of celebrities, including Ed Sullivan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, William F. Buckley Jr., Peter Lorre, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Arsenio Hall. Williams&#x27;s role in &quot;Aladdin&quot; became one of his most recognized and best-loved, and the film was the highest-grossing of 1992; it won numerous awards, including a Special Golden Globe Award for Vocal Work in a Motion Picture for Williams. His performance paved the way for other animated films to incorporate actors with more star power. Williams was named a Disney Legend in 2009.

Due to Disney breaking an agreement with Williams regarding the use of the Genie in the advertising for &quot;Aladdin&quot;, he refused to sign for the direct-to-video sequel, &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; (1994); the Genie was instead voiced by Dan Castellaneta. When Jeffrey Katzenberg was replaced by Joe Roth as Walt Disney Studios chairman, Roth organized a public apology to Williams. He would, in turn, reprise the role in the second sequel, &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot; (1996). During this time, Williams lent his voice to &quot;&quot; (1992). Other dramatic performances by Williams include &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot; (1984), &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (1998) and &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; (1999). During the early 2000s, Williams demonstrated a new rank of his versatility by playing darker roles than he had in the previous decades. Williams appeared with fellow comedian, Billy Crystal, in an unscripted cameo at the beginning of a 1997 episode of the third season of &quot;Friends&quot;.

Williams&#x27;s performances garnered various accolades, including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;; as well as two previous Academy Award nominations, for &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, and as a troubled homeless man in &quot;The Fisher King&quot;, respectively. Among the actors who helped Williams during his acting career, he credited Robert De Niro, from whom Williams learned the power of silence and economy of dialogue when acting. From Dustin Hoffman, with whom Williams co-starred in &quot;Hook&quot;, he learned to take on totally different character types, and to transform his characters by extreme preparation. Mike Medavoy, producer of &quot;Hook&quot;, told its director, Steven Spielberg, that he intentionally teamed up Hoffman and Williams for the film because he knew they wanted to work together, and that Williams welcomed the opportunity of working with Spielberg. Having Woody Allen, who directed him and Billy Crystal in &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997), helped Williams. Allen knew that Crystal and Williams had often worked together on stage.

=== 2000‚Äì2014: Children&#x27;s films and return to television ===
Williams was the host of a talk show for Audible that aired in April 2000 and was only available on Audible&#x27;s website. In &quot;Insomnia&quot; (2002), Williams portrayed a murderer on the run from a sleep-deprived Los Angeles police detective (played by Al Pacino) in rural Alaska. That same year, in the psychological thriller &quot;One Hour Photo&quot;, Williams portrayed an emotionally disturbed photo development technician who becomes obsessed with a family for whom he has developed pictures for a long time. In the 2004 science fiction psychological thriller &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, Williams played a professional who specializes in editing the memories of unsavory people into uncritical memorials that are played at funerals. His many television appearances included an episode of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, and Williams starred in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. He headlined his own one-man show, &quot;Robin Williams: Live on Broadway&quot;, which played at the Broadway Theatre in July 2002.

Williams&#x27;s stand-up work was a consistent thread throughout his career, as seen by the success of his one-man show (and subsequent DVD), &quot;Robin Williams: Live on Broadway&quot; (2002). In 2004, Williams was voted 13th on Comedy Central&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time.&quot; Two years later, he was the Surprise Guest at the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, and appeared on an episode of &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; that aired January 30. After a six-year hiatus, in August 2008, Williams announced a new 26-city tour, &quot;Weapons of Self-Destruction&quot;. The tour began at the end of September 2009, and concluded in New York on December 3, and was the subject of an HBO Special on December 8, 2009.
Years after the films, Janet Hirshenson revealed in an interview that Williams had expressed interest in portraying Rubeus Hagrid in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, but was rejected by director Chris Columbus due to the &quot;British-only edict&quot;. In 2006, Williams starred in five movies, including &quot;Man of the Year&quot;, a political satire, and &quot;The Night Listener&quot;, a thriller about a radio show host who realizes that a child with whom he has developed a friendship may not exist. Williams continued to provide voices in other animated films, including &quot;Robots&quot; (2005), the &quot;Happy Feet&quot; film franchise (2006‚Äì2011), and an uncredited vocal performance in &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Hero&quot; (2006). He also voiced the holographic character Dr. Know in the live-action film &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001). Williams was the voice of The Timekeeper, a former attraction at the Walt Disney World Resort about a time-traveling robot who encounters Jules Verne and brings him to the future.

In 2010, Williams appeared in a sketch with Robert De Niro on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and in 2012, he guest-starred as himself in two FX series, &quot;Louie&quot; and &quot;Wilfred&quot;. Williams made his Broadway acting debut in Rajiv Joseph&#x27;s &quot;Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo&quot;, which opened at the Richard Rodgers Theatre March 31, 2011. For his performance, Williams was nominated for the Drama League Award for Outstanding Distinguished Performer. In May 2013, CBS started a new series, &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot;, starring Williams, which was canceled after one season. &quot;The Angriest Man in Brooklyn&quot; was his last movie to be released during his lifetime. In the movie, Williams played Henry Altmann, an angry, bitter man who tries to change his life after being told he has a terminal illness. Four films starring Williams were released after his death in 2014: &quot;Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb&quot;, &quot;A Merry Friggin&#x27; Christmas&quot;, &quot;Boulevard&quot;, and &quot;Absolutely Anything&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===

Williams married actress Valerie Velardi in 1978, following a live-in relationship with comedian Elayne Boosler. Velardi and Williams met in 1976 while he was working as a bartender at a San Francisco tavern. Their son, Zachary Pym, was born in 1983. Velardi and Williams were divorced in 1988.

While it was reported that Williams began an affair with Zachary&#x27;s nanny, Marsha Garces, in 1986, Velardi stated in the 2018 documentary, &quot;Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind&quot;, that the relationship with Garces began after the two had separated. On April 30, 1989, Williams married Garces, who was six months pregnant with their first child. They had two children, Zelda Rae (b. 1989) and Cody Alan (b. 1991). In March 2008, Garces filed for divorce from Williams, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in 2010.

In 2011, Williams married graphic designer Susan Schneider, and they remained married until his death. They lived at their house in Sea Cliff, San Francisco, California. Williams said, &quot;My children give me a great sense of wonder. Just to see them develop into these extraordinary human beings.&quot;

===Interests===

In New York City, Williams was part of the West Side YMCA runners club and showed promising results with 34:21 minutes at a 10K run in Central Park in 1975. His favorite books were the &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy by Isaac Asimov, and his favorite book as a child was &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, which he later shared with his children.

Williams was an enthusiast of both pen-and-paper role-playing games and video games. His daughter Zelda was named after the title character from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, a family favorite video game series, and Williams sometimes performed at consumer entertainment trade shows.

Williams was a big fan of anime and collecting figures. His daughter described him as a &quot;figurine hoarder&quot;; one of his figures was the character Deunan Knute from the anime film &quot;Appleseed&quot;, which Williams was a fan of. He also liked the film &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot;.

Williams also became a devoted cycling enthusiast, having taken up the sport partly as a substitute for drugs. Eventually, he accumulated a large bicycle collection and became a fan of professional road cycling, often traveling to racing events such as the Tour de France. In 2016, Williams&#x27; children donated 87 of his bicycles in support of the Challenged Athletes Foundation and Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation.

===Religion===

Williams was raised and sometimes identified himself as an Episcopalian. In a comedy routine, Williams described his denomination as: &quot;I have that idea of Chicago Protestant, Episcopal‚ÄîCatholic light: half the religion, half the guilt.&quot; He also described himself as an &quot;honorary Jew&quot;, and on Israel&#x27;s 60th Independence Day in 2008, Williams appeared in Times Square, along with several other celebrities, to wish Israel a happy birthday.

===Philanthropy===
In 1986, Williams teamed up with Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Crystal to establish Comic Relief USA. This annual HBO television benefit devoted to the homeless raised $80million as of 2014. Bob Zmuda, creator of Comic Relief, explains that Williams felt blessed because he came from a wealthy home, but wanted to do something to help those less fortunate. Williams made benefit appearances to support literacy and women&#x27;s rights, along with appearing at benefits for veterans. He was a regular on the USO circuit, where Williams traveled to 13 countries and performed to approximately 90,000 troops. After his death, the USO thanked Williams &quot;for all he did for the men and women of our armed forces&quot;.

Williams and his second wife Marsha founded a philanthropic organization called the Windfall Foundation to raise money for many charities. In December 1999, he sang in French on the BBC-inspired music video of international celebrities doing a cover of The Rolling Stones single &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll (But I Like It)&quot; for the charity Children&#x27;s Promise.
In response to the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, Williams donated all proceeds of his &quot;Weapons of Self Destruction&quot; Christchurch performance to help rebuild the New Zealand city. Half the proceeds were donated to the Red Cross and half to the mayoral building fund. Williams performed with the USO for U.S. troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

For several years, Williams supported St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.

=== Substance abuse issues ===

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Williams had an addiction to cocaine. He was a casual friend of John Belushi, and partied with the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; comedian the night before Belushi died of a drug overdose in 1982. The shock of Belushi&#x27;s death, along with the birth of his son Zak, prompted Williams to quit drugs and alcohol: &quot;Was it a wake-up call? Oh yeah, on a huge level. The grand jury helped, too.&quot; Williams turned to exercise and cycling to help alleviate his depression shortly after Belushi&#x27;s death; according to bicycle shop owner Tony Tom, Williams said, &quot;cycling saved my life&quot;.

In 2003, Williams started drinking again while working on the film &quot;The Big White&quot; (2005) in Alaska. In 2006, he checked in to a substance-abuse rehabilitation center in Newberg, Oregon, saying that he was an alcoholic. Years afterward, Williams acknowledged his failure to maintain sobriety, but said that he never returned to using cocaine, declaring in a 2010 interview:

In mid-2014, Williams was admitted to the Hazelden Foundation Addiction Treatment Center in Center City, Minnesota, for treatment for alcoholism.

=== Health problems ===

In March 2009, Williams was hospitalized due to heart problems. He postponed his one-man tour for surgery to replace his aortic valve, repair his mitral valve and correct his irregular heartbeat. The surgery was completed March 13, 2009, at the Cleveland Clinic.

His publicist, Mara Buxbaum, commented that Williams had severe depression before his death. His wife, Susan Schneider, said that in the period before his death, Williams had been sober but was diagnosed with early-stage Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which was information that he was &quot;not yet ready to share publicly&quot;. An autopsy revealed that Williams had diffuse Lewy bodies (which had been misdiagnosed as Parkinson&#x27;s), and this may have contributed to his depression.

In an essay published in the journal &quot;Neurology&quot; two years after his death, Schneider revealed that the pathology of Lewy body disease in Williams was described by several doctors as among the worst pathologies they had seen. She described the early symptoms of his disease as beginning in October 2013. Williams&#x27;s initial condition included a sudden and prolonged spike in fear, anxiety, stress and insomnia, which worsened in severity and included memory loss, paranoia and delusions. According to Schneider, &quot;Robin was losing his mind and he was aware of it... He kept saying, &#x27;I just want to reboot my brain.

==Death==
Williams was found dead at age 63 in his home in Paradise Cay, California, on August 11, 2014. The final autopsy report, released that November, concluded that Williams&#x27;s death was a suicide resulting from &quot;asphyxia due to hanging&quot;. Neither alcohol nor illegal drugs were involved, and prescription drugs present in his body were at therapeutic levels. The report also noted that Williams had depression and anxiety. An examination of his brain tissue suggested that Williams had &quot;diffuse Lewy body dementia&quot;. Describing the disease as &quot;the terrorist inside my husband&#x27;s brain&quot;, Schneider said that &quot;however you look at it‚Äîthe presence of Lewy bodies took his life&quot;, referring to his previous diagnosis of Parkinson&#x27;s. She noted &quot;how we as a culture don&#x27;t have the vocabulary to discuss brain disease in the way we do about depression. Depression is a symptom of LBD and it&#x27;s not about psychology ‚Äì it&#x27;s rooted in neurology. His brain was falling apart.&quot; Medical experts had earlier struggled to determine a cause, and had eventually diagnosed him with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

The Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) clarified the distinction between the term used in the autopsy report, &quot;diffuse Lewy body dementia&quot;, which is more commonly called &quot;diffuse Lewy body disease&quot;, and refers to the underlying disease process‚Äîand the umbrella term, &quot;Lewy body dementia&quot;‚Äîwhich encompasses both Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). According to LBDA spokesperson Dennis Dickson, &quot;The report confirms he experienced depression, anxiety, and paranoia, which may occur in either Parkinson&#x27;s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies... In early PD, Lewy bodies are generally limited in distribution, but in DLB, the Lewy bodies are spread widely throughout the brain, as was the case with Robin Williams.&quot; Ian G. McKeith, professor and researcher of Lewy body dementias, commented that Williams&#x27;s symptoms and autopsy findings were explained by DLB. Williams&#x27;s body was cremated at Monte&#x27;s Chapel of the Hills in San Anselmo, and his ashes were scattered over San Francisco Bay on August 21, 2014.

===Aftermath and tributes===
Following the announcement of Williams&#x27;s death, many figures in the entertainment industry praised him on social media. Schneider said, &quot;I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken.&quot; His daughter, Zelda Williams, responded to his death by saying that the &quot;world is forever a little darker, less colorful and less full of laughter in his absence&quot;.

President Barack Obama released a statement on Williams&#x27;s death:
Williams was scheduled to be the &quot;Blackmail&quot; special guest for the final night of Monty Python&#x27;s ten-date stage shows in London one month before his death‚Äîwith his friend, Monty Python&#x27;s Eric Idle‚Äîbut he canceled, stating that he was &quot;suffering from severe depression&quot;. The show&#x27;s subsequent home video release was dedicated to Williams.

At the United Nations headquarters on August 12, Williams was celebrated during the opening of the International Youth Day. In the presence of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Assistant Secretary General Thomas Gass paid tribute to Williams by standing on the pulpit of the ECOSOC Chamber and quoting one of Keating&#x27;s lines from &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;: &quot;Dare to look at things in a different way!&quot;. Several fans similarly paid tribute to Williams on social media with photo and video reenactments of &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;‚Ä≥s &quot;O Captain! My Captain!&quot; scene.

Shortly after Williams died, Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior aired &quot;Aladdin&quot; commercial-free over the course of a week, with a dedicated drawing of the Genie at the end of each airing before the credits. In honor of his theater work, the lights of Broadway were darkened for the evening of August 14. That night, the cast of the &quot;Aladdin&quot; musical honored Williams by having the audience join them in a sing-along of &quot;Friend Like Me&quot;, an Oscar-nominated song originally sung by Williams in the film &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

Fans of Williams created makeshift memorials at his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and at locations from his television and film career, such as the bench in Boston&#x27;s Public Garden featured in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;; the Pacific Heights, San Francisco home used in &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;; the sign for Parrish Shoes in Keene, New Hampshire, where parts of &quot;Jumanji&quot; were filmed; and the Boulder, Colorado, home used for &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;.

During the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 25, close friend and fellow comedian, Billy Crystal, presented a tribute to Williams, referring to him as &quot;the brightest star in our comedy galaxy&quot;. Afterward, some of Williams&#x27;s best comedy moments were shown, including his first &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; appearance, indicating his great life in making people laugh. Talk show hosts, including David Letterman, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon, paid tribute to Williams on their respective shows.

On September 9, 2014, PBS aired a one-hour special devoted to Williams&#x27;s career, and on September 27, dozens of leading stars and celebrities held a tribute in San Francisco to celebrate his life and career. British heavy metal band Iron Maiden dedicated a song to Williams, titled &quot;Tears of a Clown&quot;, on their 2015 album &quot;The Book of Souls&quot;. The song looks into his depression and suicide, and how he attempted to hide his condition from the public.

A tunnel painted with a rainbow on Highway 101, north of the Golden Gate Bridge, was officially named the &quot;Robin Williams Tunnel&quot; on February 29, 2016. In 2017, Sharon Meadow in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park, the home of the annual Comedy Day, was renamed &quot;Robin Williams Meadow&quot;.

In 2018, HBO produced a documentary about his life and career. Directed by Marina Zenovich, the film &quot;Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind&quot; was also screened at the Sundance Film Festival. That same year, a mural of Robin Williams was created on Market Street in San Francisco. Work on a biography was begun by &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer David Itzkoff in 2014, and was published four years later, titled &quot;Robin&quot;.

In September 2020, Vertical Entertainment released a documentary titled &quot;Robin&#x27;s Wish&quot;. Directed by Tylor Norwood, the film explores Williams&#x27;s battle with Lewy body dementia. In May 2022, Williams was inducted into the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New York.
== Recognition and legacy==
Although Williams was first recognized as a stand-up comedian and television star, he became known for acting in film roles of substance and serious drama. Williams was considered a &quot;national treasure&quot; by many in the entertainment industry and by the public.
Williams&#x27;s onstage energy and improvisational skill became a model for a new generation of stand-up comedians. Many comedians valued the way he worked highly personal issues into his comedy routines, especially his honesty about drug and alcohol addiction, along with depression. According to media scholar Derek A. Burrill, because of the openness with which Williams spoke about his own life, &quot;probably the most important contribution he made to pop culture, across so many different media, was as Robin Williams the person&quot;.
Williams created a signature free-form comedy persona so widely and uniquely identified that new comedians like Jim Carrey impersonated him, paving the way for the growing comedy scene that developed in San Francisco. Young comedians felt more liberated on stage by seeing his spontaneously diverse range: &quot;One moment acting as a bright, mischievous child, then as a wise philosopher or alien from outer space&quot;. According to Judd Apatow, the eclectic performer&#x27;s rapid-fire improvisational style was an inspiration as well as an influence for other comedians, but his talent was so extremely unusual no one else could possibly attempt to copy it.

Williams&#x27;s film performances often influenced other actors, both in and out of the film industry. Director Chris Columbus, who directed him in &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, says watching him work &quot;was a magical and special privilege. His performances were unlike anything any of us had ever seen, they came from some spiritual and otherworldly place.&quot; Looking over most of Williams&#x27;s filmography, Alyssa Rosenberg at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was &quot;struck by the breadth&quot; and radical diversity of most of his roles, writing that &quot;Williams helped us grow up&quot;.

=== Comedic style ===
Williams said that, partly due to the stress of performing stand-up, he started using drugs and alcohol early in his career. He further said that he neither drank nor took drugs while on stage, but occasionally performed when hung over from the previous day. During the period when he was using cocaine, Williams said it made him paranoid when performing on stage.

Williams once described the life of stand-up comedians as follows:
Some, such as the critic Vincent Canby, were concerned that Williams&#x27;s monologues were so intense that it seemed as though, at any minute, his &quot;creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown&quot;. His biographer, Emily Herbert, described Williams&#x27;s &quot;intense, utterly manic style of stand-up [which sometimes] defies analysis... [going] beyond energetic, beyond frenetic... [and sometimes] dangerous... because of what it said about the creator&#x27;s own mental state.&quot; Regarding the quick-fire delivery of his performance, Williams said, &quot;Usually, you start off performing in bars, where you can&#x27;t really take your time, because people go: [&quot;mimics a drunk person&quot;] &#x27;Oy, what are you doing now?&#x27; So I developed a style that was very much synaptic: quick-firing, moving, so that they never really had a chance to lock on as a target.&quot;

Williams felt secure that he would not run out of ideas, as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied. He also explained that he often used free association of ideas while improvising to keep the audience interested. The competitive nature of the show made things difficult. For example, some comedians said that Williams had stolen their jokes, which he strongly denied. David Brenner claimed that he confronted Williams&#x27;s agent and threatened bodily harm if he heard him utter another one of his jokes. Whoopi Goldberg defended Williams, asserting that it is difficult for comedians not to reuse another comedian&#x27;s material, and that it is done &quot;all the time&quot;. Subsequently, he avoided going to performances of other comedians to deter similar accusations.

During a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview in 1992, Williams was asked whether he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life. He replied, &quot;There&#x27;s that fear‚Äîif I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock, that I still couldn&#x27;t speak, fire off or talk about things, if I&#x27;d start to worry or got too afraid to say something... If I stop trying, I get afraid.&quot; While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosi≈Ñski to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt that he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.

===Influences===

Williams credited comedians, including Jonathan Winters, Peter Sellers, Nichols and May and Lenny Bruce as influences, admiring their ability to attract a more intellectual audience with a higher level of wit. He also liked Jay Leno for his quickness in ad-libbing comedy routines, and Sid Caesar, whose acts he felt were &quot;precious&quot;.

Jonathan Winters was his &quot;idol&quot; early in life; Williams, aged eight, first saw him on television and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career. Williams was inspired by Winters&#x27;s ingenuity, saying &quot;that anything is possible, that anything is funny... He gave me the idea that it can be free-form, that you can go in and out of things pretty easily.&quot;

During an interview in London in 2002, Williams told Michael Parkinson that Peter Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, stating, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t get better than that.&quot; British comedy actors Dudley Moore and Peter Cook were also among his influences, Williams told Parkinson.

Williams was also influenced by Richard Pryor&#x27;s fearless ability to talk about his personal life onstage, with subjects that included his use of drugs and alcohol, and Williams added those kinds of topics during his own performances. By bringing up such personal matters as a form of comedy, Williams told Parkinson that it was &quot;cheaper than therapy&quot;, and gave him a way to release his pent-up energy and emotions.

==Acting credits and accolades ==
Throughout his career, Williams won numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997). He also won six Golden Globe Awards, including Best Actor‚ÄîMotion Picture Musical or Comedy for his roles in &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; (1987), &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991) and &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993), along with the Special Golden Globe Award for Vocal Work in a Motion Picture for his role Genie in &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992), and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2005. Williams also received two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and five Grammy Awards.

<text>The Complete Plain Words, titled simply Plain Words in its 2014 revision, is a style guide written by Sir Ernest Gowers, published in 1954. It has never been out of print. It comprises expanded and revised versions of two pamphlets that he wrote at the request of HM Treasury, &quot;Plain Words&quot; (1948) and &quot;ABC of Plain Words&quot; (1951). The aim of the book is to help officials in their use of English as a tool of their trade. To keep the work relevant for readers in subsequent decades it has been revised by Sir Bruce Fraser in 1973, by Sidney Greenbaum and Janet Whitcut in 1986, and by the original author&#x27;s great-granddaughter Rebecca Gowers in 2014.

All the editions until that of 2014 were published by Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office (HMSO). The most recent is issued by an imprint of Penguin Books.

==Background==
The association of wordiness with bureaucracy has a long history. In the 14th century Geoffrey Chaucer, a prominent civil servant as well as a poet, urged the use of straightforward writing. Reviewing &quot;Plain Words&quot; in 1948, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; quoted the French revolutionary Martial Herman writing in 1794:

The British civil service of the 19th and early 20th centuries had a reputation for pomposity and long-windedness in its written communications. In &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; in the mid-1850s, Charles Dickens caricatured officialdom as the &quot;Circumlocution Office&quot;, where for even the most urgent matter nothing could be done without &quot;half a score of boards, half a bushel of minutes, several sacks of official memoranda, and a family-vault full of ungrammatical correspondence.&quot; By the 1880s the term &quot;officialese&quot; was in use, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as, &quot;The formal and typically verbose language considered characteristic of officials or official documents&quot;.
Sir Ernest Gowers, a senior civil servant, was among those who wished to see officialese replaced by normal English. In 1929 he remarked in a speech about the civil service, &quot;It is said... that we revel in jargon and obscurity&quot;. During the Second World War, with the role of government greatly expanded, official communications proliferated, and in Gowers&#x27;s view were full of &quot;mistiness and grandiloquence&quot;. He called for a new style of official writing, friendly in tone and easy to understand. His views came to the notice of the head of the civil service, Sir Edward Bridges, permanent secretary to the Treasury. After Gowers retired from the civil service at the end of the war, Bridges asked him to write a short pamphlet on good writing, for the benefit of the new generation of officials. Bridges called on his senior colleagues throughout the civil service to cooperate; some had already made efforts in the same cause, including the Inland Revenue, whose advice to staff included &quot;one golden rule to bear in mind always: that we should try to put ourselves in the position of our correspondent, to imagine his feelings as he writes his letters, and to gauge his reaction as he receives ours.&quot;

Government departments sent Gowers many examples of officialese so extreme as to be amusing; a small committee of senior officials formed to help him and comment on his proposals. The colleague on whom Gowers most relied was Llewelyn Wyn Griffith of the Inland Revenue, whose contribution Gowers acknowledged in the prefaces to &quot;Plain Words&quot; and its two successors.

==&quot;Plain Words&quot;, 1948==
The result of Gowers&#x27;s work was &quot;Plain Words&quot;, a 94-page booklet. It was judged successful by the civil service, and the Treasury considered that it should be made publicly available. Had Gowers written it as part of his duties while still a civil servant it would have automatically been Crown copyright, but as he had not begun it until after his retirement he owned the rights. The Treasury offered a flat fee of ¬£500, but he successfully held out for a royalty on every copy sold. The government publisher, His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office (HMSO), issued the booklet for sale in April 1948. It was priced at two shillings (10 pence in British decimal currency); between April and Christmas 1948 it sold more than 150,000 copies and had to be reprinted seven times.

Reviewers responded favourably. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; praised the book and engaged in a little mock-officialese of its own: &quot;It deserves to be a &#x27;best seller&#x27; (or perhaps we should say that in all the circumstances it may reasonably be anticipated that it will be found to evoke a relatively considerable demand on the part of the general public).&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; devoted a leader to the work, and concluded, &quot;for all its cool urbanity &quot;Plain Words&quot; is written with missionary zeal&quot;. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; considered that by commissioning &quot;Plain Words&quot; from Gowers &quot;the Treasury has put us all in its debt.&quot; &quot;The Economist&quot; commented, &quot;The Stationery Office must have enjoyed publishing this book. It is great fun to read&quot;.

Occasionally Gowers&#x27;s humour misled literal-minded reviewers. &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, Harold Nicolson and the grammarian G H Vallins objected to the conspicuously un-plain words of Gowers&#x27;s opening sentences:

When revising the text in preparation for &quot;The Complete Plain Words&quot;, Gowers abandoned the joke, and rewrote the second sentence as, &quot;I suspect that this project may be received by many of them without any marked enthusiasm or gratitude.&quot; A substantive objection by Vallins to &quot;the cult of &#x27;plain English&#x27;&quot; was his view that verbose phrases lose important nuances when reduced to plain words. He gave as an example &quot;evacuated to alternative accommodation&quot;, which in his opinion has overtones that Gowers&#x27;s &quot;taken to other houses&quot; lacks.

==&quot;ABC of Plain Words&quot;, 1951==

The Treasury invited Gowers to build on the success of &quot;Plain Words&quot; by producing a second volume of advice on good, clear writing. As with its predecessor, he &quot;had many helpers to thank&quot;, including Griffith and other civil service colleagues. He also drew on the works of well-known writers on English usage, including H W Fowler, A P Herbert and Eric Partridge. &quot;The ABC of Plain Words&quot; had 160 pages, and was priced at three shillings (15p).

Gowers explained the purpose of the new book in his preface, &quot;We must have something that can be kept on the desk and consulted on points of difficulty as they arise. &quot;Plain Words&quot; is of little use for that: it has not even an index&quot;. The new work consisted of articles, mostly brief, on points of vocabulary, grammar, construction, punctuation and style, set out in alphabetical order, beginning with &quot;Abstract words&quot; and ending with &quot;Write&quot;. The former was one of the longer entries, explaining the dangers of overuse of abstract words, and recommending concrete terms where possible. Thus, &quot;Was this the realisation of an anticipated liability?&quot; would be better as, &quot;Did you expect to have to do this?&quot; The entry on &quot;Write&quot; was an example of one of the short articles on particular words; it pointed out that &quot;I wrote to you about it&quot; needs the &quot;to&quot; but &quot;I wrote you a letter&quot; does not.

Gowers and his successors revised their advice as usage changed over the years. Two consecutive entries in &quot;The ABC&quot; illustrate how some comments have become dated and others have not: Gowers warned in 1951 that the word &quot;backlog&quot; meaning &quot;arrears&quot; would be unintelligible to British readers, and in the next entry he advised that the construction &quot;on a ... basis&quot; should be avoided. The latter remains a frequent feature of loose writing and all the editions of the &quot;Plain Words&quot; books retain and expand Gowers&#x27;s advice, whereas within three years of writing &quot;The ABC&quot;, Gowers noted in &quot;The Complete Plain Words&quot; that &quot;backlog&quot; was rapidly and usefully establishing itself in British usage.

Neither the Treasury nor HMSO expected the second book to rival the popularity of its predecessor, but it sold nearly 80,000 copies in its first year. Gowers was nevertheless not wholly happy with it. He thought the A‚ÄìZ layout had two disadvantages. The first was that it gave the wrong impression that all the topics were of equal importance; the second was that the people most in need of advice would not think to look up the relevant entry: &quot;There is no reason why anyone addicted to abstract nouns, unconscious of any offence, should ever be prompted to read that article; nor can I think of any other title for it that would be more likely to throw it in his way.&quot;

==&quot;The Complete Plain Words&quot;, 1954==
By 1954 both books were still selling well. Almost 300,000 copies of &quot;Plain Words&quot; and more than 130,000 of &quot;The ABC&quot; had been sold. The Treasury, HMSO and Gowers agreed that the obvious and best course would be to combine the two booklets into a single volume. This Gowers did, with help from his colleagues, as before; he made many revisions as a result of &quot;the many correspondents from all parts of the English-speaking world who have been good enough ‚Ä¶ to send me suggestions, criticisms and specimens&quot;. An example of his revisions is in the entry on &quot;bottleneck&quot;, of which in 1951 he had written four brief sentences warning against overuse: in 1954 he felt it necessary to write 270 words, so ubiquitous had the term become. (By the time of the 1973 revision the fad for the word had declined, and Fraser&#x27;s entry is very much shorter.)

&quot;The Complete Plain Words&quot; contained 226 pages, including seven pages of index. It was a hardback, in green cloth binding with dust-jacket, in HMSO&#x27;s preferred size, used for the two earlier Plain Words books, 8.4in x 5.25in (21.3¬†cm x 13.3¬†cm). It was published in September 1954 at what &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; called the remarkably cheap price of five shillings (25p). &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; greeted the publication: &quot;It may be hoped that in this more durable form the book&#x27;s good influence will continue to spread: Civil Servants have not been alone in profiting from it in the past, nor should they be in the future.&quot; The book has remained in print, in its original and revised editions, ever since.

Between Gowers&#x27;s prologue and epilogue there is a Digression on Legal English followed by chapters on The Elements, Correctness, Avoiding the Superfluous Word, Choosing the Familiar Word, Choosing the Precise Word, The Handling of Words, and Punctuation.

==1973 revision by Bruce Fraser==
The 1954 text was reprinted seven times during Gowers&#x27;s lifetime, and he made a number of amendments in the various impressions. Changing times in the 1960s meant that a substantial revision was needed if the book was to continue to fulfil its purpose. Gowers, fully occupied for a decade in making the first revision of Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;, was unable to carry out the task; he died in 1966, a few months after the publication of the revised Fowler. Another retired senior civil servant, Bruce Fraser, was asked to revise &quot;The Complete Plain Words&quot;. The new edition, 250 pages long, was published by HMSO at ¬£1, in hardback with black cloth binding and dust-jacket, in the same format as the first edition.

Fraser preserved Gowers&#x27;s structure, and added three new chapters, the most important of which was titled &quot;Some recent trends&quot;; it covered the increasing prevalence of informality, and the influences of America, science, technology, economics, business, and personnel management. The final sections of the chapter were on &quot;vogue words&quot; and &quot;modish writing&quot;. Fraser noted that though Gowers had said approvingly in 1954 that the use of the subjunctive was dying out, it was now, under the influence of American writing, making an unwelcome reappearance in English usage.

Reviewing the new edition in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, David Hunt commented of Fraser, &quot;his wit, perhaps a little drier and more Scottish, is equally acute, diverting and instructive&quot;. In &quot;The Times&quot;, Dennis Potter said that the book remained &quot;the happiest thing to come out of the Treasury&quot;. He praised Fraser for replacing Gowers&#x27;s dated examples of officialese with modern specimens and updating the text to reflect current trends, but concluded:
The Fraser edition was reprinted in hardback three times between 1973 and 1983. Penguin published a paperback version in the UK in 1973, and in the US in 1975.

==1986 revision by Sidney Greenbaum and Janet Whitcut==
The third edition was commissioned not by the Treasury but by Her Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office, to mark its bicentenary. The revision was made not by an experienced public servant but by an academic and a lexicographer, Sidney Greenbaum, Quain Professor of English Language and Literature at University College, London and Janet Whitcut, formerly senior research editor of the Longman Dictionary. They chose to revise Fraser&#x27;s 1973 version rather than starting from Gowers&#x27;s original. Having two authors made it necessary to abandon Gowers&#x27;s frequent use of the first person; Fraser had retained it, stating &quot;...the reader may take it that &#x27;I&#x27; means either &#x27;Gowers agreed with by Fraser&#x27; or &#x27;Fraser, confident that Gowers would agree with him&#x27;&quot;. With joint authors for the new edition, this could not be sustained, and the change from first person to impersonal removed some of the book&#x27;s previous character. An example is in the section on punctuation, where Gowers wrote, &quot;The author of the style-book of the Oxford University Press... says &#x27;If you take hyphens seriously you will surely go mad&#x27;. I have no intention of taking hyphens seriously.&quot; In the new edition the second sentence read, &quot;You should not take hyphens seriously&quot;. Rebecca Gowers objects that this approach &quot;systematically depersonalise[s] the writing&quot;.

The new edition, in the same format as its two predecessors, is in blue cloth, with dust-jacket, and has 298 pages. A paperback version was issued by Penguin Books in 1987, and an American hardback edition was published in 1988 by Godine Publishing, Boston.

==2014 revision by Rebecca Gowers==
The last direct link between &quot;Plain Words&quot; and the public service was broken in 1996, when HMSO was dismembered under governmental privatisation policy. The 2014 edition of the book was published by Particular Books, an imprint of Penguin Books. It was printed on lower-weight paper and in a smaller format than its predecessors. The reviser was Rebecca Gowers, Ernest&#x27;s great-granddaughter, a novelist and author of a non-fiction book about a Victorian murder. She begins the new edition with a twenty-page preface that includes a biographical sketch of Ernest Gowers and a history of the revisions after his death.

Unlike the three earlier revisers, Rebecca Gowers generally avoids merging her own comments with the original text. Her practice is to retain Ernest Gowers&#x27;s remarks and append updated observations in a separate note. An example is the entry on the use of the noun &quot;issue&quot;. The original words were:

To which the reviser has added:
Although Fraser, Greenbaum and Whitcut remained broadly faithful to Gowers&#x27;s original structure and chapter headings, with some minor changes, Rebecca Gowers reverts to the original almost exclusively. The modernisations she introduces, such as the consideration of gender-neutral language, are incorporated into the chapters of the 1954 book.

<text>Liberty BASIC (LB) is a commercial computer programming language and integrated development environment (IDE). It has an interpreter, developed in Smalltalk, which recognizes its own dialect of the BASIC programming language. It runs on 16- and 32-bit Windows and OS/2.

== Background ==
Liberty BASIC was written by Carl &quot;Gunner&quot; Gundel and published in its first release by his company, Shoptalk Systems, in 1991. It has progressed steadily since then. to the software, version 4.5.1, was in June 2018.

Though Liberty BASIC has its share of limitations in its design for advanced programming, it provides an introductory integrated development environment, IDE, for moderate to advanced users of Windows and OS/2. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) are available. In its current version, it runs only on Microsoft Windows, and under Wine on Linux. Alpha testing of Liberty BASIC v5.0 is underway with versions that run on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and on the Raspberry Pi as well.

Liberty BASIC does not compile to native code. Instead it compiles the code written in the IDE to an encrypted file with the extension TKN. This file is then executed by an EXE file that carries the same file name, although this may change with the release of version 5.

== Features ==

* A visual development tool called FreeForm, written in Liberty BASIC and greatly extended by the Liberty BASIC community over the years
* Source level debugger
* calling of DLLs and application programming interfaces (APIs)
* Color graphics capability
* Can create games with sprite animation, sound, music, and joystick control
* An add-on package called Assist with many new features, such as a code formatter, source code versioning, a performance profiler, an easy-to-use code difference browser, and an improved package and deployment system

=== Distinguishing features ===
Liberty BASIC allows for procedural programming using a default &quot;main window&quot; that displays formatted text and accepts user input. It also supports event-driven programming based on a graphical user interface, using several types of windows that may contain the standard controls such as buttons, menus, textboxes, etc.

A central idea in creating Liberty BASIC was to model the handling of windows after the syntax for file handling. For example, (from the Liberty BASIC Help File):

&quot;The OPEN command opens communication with a device, which can be a disk file, a window, a dynamic-link library or a serial communications port.&quot;

OPEN device FOR purpose AS #handle {LEN = n}

Once a ‚Äúdevice‚Äù is open, data and also commands to control that device can be ‚Äúprinted‚Äù to it. For each type of device there is a set of commands which can be sent to it in this way. In the more recent versions of LB the word &quot;print&quot; may be dropped from the &quot;print&quot; statement, making the syntax even simpler.

Simplicity has been at the heart of Liberty BASIC from the beginning. This makes it easier to learn but at some cost, perhaps, in limiting functionality. Only two data types are supported in LB v4.03¬†‚Äî numeric and string. No type declarations are required; any variable with a $ sign at the end of its name is a string variable, otherwise it is numeric. (The plan for LB v5 is to support other types and user defined types as well as these.) For the purpose of making calls to an API or third-party DLLs there is a STRUCT and the additional types necessary for the DLL. The only other data structure supported is the ARRAY. Arrays of one or two dimensions are supported. LB v5 may support arrays of user-defined types.

== Notable programs written in Liberty BASIC ==
* FreeForm, a GUI editor for creating GUI formats

==Example code==
Here are some examples of the language:
&quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:

print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
end

Program to display a pop-up message box with the words &quot;Hello, World!&quot; on it:

nomainwin
notice &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
end

nomainwin
notice &quot;Example program&quot; + CHR$(13) + &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
end

Program to display an input box:

nomainwin
prompt &quot;Enter your name:&quot;; response$
notice &quot;Response:&quot; + CHR$(13) + response$
end

Running another application:

nomainwin
run &quot;notepad.exe&quot;
end

Printing multiplication table of 5 on form:

[multi]
 for i = 1 to 15
 res = 5 * i
 print res
 next i
end

==Alternative implementations==
The GNU/Liberty Basic Compiler Collection (GLBCC), by Anthony Liguori, is a set of tools to compile Liberty Basic programs, runs on Windows and Linux systems, but the project has not been updated since 2001.

In 2012 an alternative Windows implementation of Liberty BASIC, LB Booster (LBB), became available. Although substantially compatible with the Liberty BASIC 4 language syntax, LBB was developed entirely independently by Richard Russell and is written in BBC BASIC.

LBB offers (typically) increased execution speed, smaller self-contained executables and some additional capabilities. However LBB is not 100% compatible with LB4 and while many programs will run without modification, some may need to be adapted, or may even be unsuitable for running under LBB.

Liberty Basic does not provide for data declarations. Instead any new data name is treated as a new declaration. Some regard this as a benefit, others see it as a debugging issue for imperfect typers. In 2019 Peter J. D. Matthews devised a method for adding declarations and checking for undeclared data - without changing the code seen by the LB interpreter. In 2023 this system was ported to GitHub in public repository &quot;LBPrePass&quot; for anyone to use. This repository also contains program documentation. The program is written in Liberty Basic 4.5.1 and is intended to analyse 4.5.1 code.

<text>The Balducci levitation is a levitation illusion first described by Ed Balducci. Its inventor is unknown. It is an impromptu magic trick, which has been popularized by many magicians, such as David Roth, Paul Harris, and David Blaine.

== Effect ==
The performer stands at an angle facing away from the spectators. The performer appears to levitate a few inches above the ground. The effect generally does not last for more than five seconds. The performer&#x27;s feet return to the ground, and the effect is complete.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Other methods of levitation allow for greater heights, longer durations, and better viewing angles (see definition of angles from List of conjuring terms) for performance; however, most of these methods can only be performed on a stage because they require special equipment or setups (such as wires). The Balducci levitation requires no preparation of any kind, and so it can be performed impromptu ‚Äì anytime, anywhere. Although variations have been made to improve the illusion of genuine levitation, they are generally harder to perform, and some require gimmicks or setups that make them less practical than the Balducci levitation.

== Misdirection ==
Like many magic effects, this illusion relies mostly on subtle misdirection and acting on the part of the performer.

These psychological subtleties increase the probability that spectators will believe the illusion:
* The spectators are informed ahead of time the performer intends to levitate.
* The performer pretends to put a good deal of care in choosing a place to perform the levitation.
* The performer acts as if performing the levitation is difficult and physically straining.
* The performer emphasizes the fact that there are no gimmicks (wires, etc.) used, and encourages that the area and the performer&#x27;s clothing be examined.
* The performer provides a reason for the audience&#x27;s position: a warning he may fall and require them to catch him.

These physical subtleties make the levitation seem more amazing:
* The spectators are misdirected from the performer&#x27;s method because they are concentrating on the movement of the feet and the space that appears between the feet and the ground.
* When &quot;landing&quot;, the performer will make a point of hitting the ground hard with the feet, and bending the knees to convince the spectators that the performer&#x27;s feet were higher in the air than they actually were.

The effects of these subtleties can be seen in David Blaine&#x27;s television performances of this illusion. For example, one spectator is asked how high Blaine levitated. She gestures a height that is obviously a few inches higher than the illusion is capable of producing, demonstrating that subtleties can often cause a spectator&#x27;s interpretation of an effect to be better than the effect itself.

== Method ==
The magician positions themself at an angle to their audience, a little distance away, in such a way that the audience can only see the rearward portion of one foot and most of the other foot¬†‚Äì concealing the toe end of the &quot;far&quot; (upstage) foot. The audience group must be small enough that they can be grouped close together. The magician, with the rearward portion of their feet held together, lifts the &quot;near&quot; foot off the ground, standing on only the front part of their &quot;far&quot; foot (the one which is partially concealed) while lifting the rearward part of the &quot;far&quot; foot and all of the &quot;near&quot; foot and keeping their ankles together. The audience sees only one foot and the heel of the other (the &quot;far&quot; foot), which appear to rise off the floor. The hidden part of the &quot;far&quot; (upstage) foot supports the weight of the magician as they appear to levitate one or two inches.

Simply put: the magician stands on the front of one foot, while raising the one foot and the visible part of the other foot, blocking the view of the front of the supporting foot with the other foot and rear part of the supporting foot.

The &quot;reverse Balducci&quot; illusion is similar to the Balducci illusion, but the magician faces towards the audience at a 90-degree angle rather than facing away. The magician slowly stands on the heel of their &quot;far&quot; foot as they lift the &quot;near&quot; foot and the front of the &quot;far&quot; foot. To improve the appearance of the effect, the magician will try to maintain the near foot parallel to the ground.

Another variation that is sometimes shown on TV shows is done by performing a normal &quot;Balducci&quot;, filming the audience reaction, then later returning and performing the illusion with the aid of wires to get more height or to get a shot from the front or underneath. These shots will be edited into the footage of the original performance, thus allowing the levitation effect to be exaggerated, while still using genuine onlookers in the shot.

There is a principle in theatrical magic that &quot;the audience will often remember or describe an exaggerated effect&quot;¬†‚Äì so the audience members may not notice the increased height caused by the &quot;faked second shot&quot; (if the additional height is not more than a few extra centimeters) when watching the combined footage later, believing that they are seeing a genuine recreation of the performance. This is even more likely if, during the original performance, cameras are positioned in the same place as those from which the &quot;faked&quot; footage was later shot.

== History ==
Ed Balducci published the first known description of the illusion in July 1974 in &quot;The Pallbearer&#x27;s Review&quot; (Volume 9, Number 9, pp 755) under the name &quot;Impromptu Levitation&quot;. Balducci ended his description by saying, &quot;Originator unknown. It was shown to me many years ago by one of the Harmonicats, a cousin of mine, Erwin Levine, known as the Baron.&quot;

Despite Balducci&#x27;s disclaimer, the illusion has since been known as the &quot;Balducci levitation&quot;.

== Known variations ==
* Antigravity boots by Peter Marvey
* King levitation by Corey King
* Criss Angel&#x27;s Levitation by Criss Angel
* Sooperman by Paul Harris
* Zero Gravity by Mike Bent

== Appearances in popular media ==
* The &quot;Reverse Balducci&quot; is performed by Wade&#x27;s crew members in the film &quot;You Got Served&quot;.
* The &quot;Reverse Balducci&quot; is performed and mentioned by name in issue 25 of the comic book series &quot;&quot;.
* &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot; S3E7 features a character (Dan Black) loosely based on David Blaine, who performs the illusion in the lift; later one of the main characters (Anna) shows the other hotel staff (but not the viewer) how the illusion is performed.
* In the movie &quot;John Dies at the End&quot;, when Dave goes to a party and hears a girl gasp that a man just levitated off the ground, he asks how high and scoffs, &quot;Let me guess, about six inches above the grass right? Balducci levitation?&quot;
* In &quot;House&quot; S8E18, Dr. Gregory House performs the illusion for his team after they tell him they witnessed a patient levitating over his hospital bed.

<doc id="53254" wikidata="Q1516605" url="?curid=53254" title="History of Sardinia">
<text>Archaeological evidence of prehistoric human settlement on the island of Sardinia is present in the form of nuraghes and other prehistoric monuments, which dot the land. The recorded history of Sardinia begins with its contacts with the various people who sought to dominate western Mediterranean trade in classical antiquity: Phoenicians, Punics and Romans. Initially under the political and economic alliance with the Phoenician cities, it was partly conquered by Carthage in the late 6th century BC and then entirely by Rome after the First Punic War (230 BC). The island was included for centuries in the Roman province of Sardinia and Corsica, which would be incorporated into the diocese of &quot;Italia suburbicaria&quot; in 3rd and 7th centuries.

In the Early Middle Ages, through the European barbarian movements, the waning of the Byzantine Empire influence in the western Mediterranean and the Saracen raids, the island fell out of the sphere of influence of any higher government; this led to the birth of four independent kingdoms called &quot;Judicates&quot; (Latin: &quot;Judicati&quot;; Sardinian: &quot;Judicados&quot;) in the 8th through 10th centuries. Falling under papal influence, Sardinia became the focus of the rivalry of Genoa, Pisa, and the Crown of Aragon, which eventually subsumed the island as the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1324. The Iberian Kingdom was to last until 1718, when it was ceded to the House of Savoy; from Piedmont, the Savoyards pursued a policy of expansion to the rest of the Italian peninsula, having their Kingdom of Sardinia be later renamed into &quot;Kingdom of Italy&quot; in 1861.

==Prehistory==


The oldest trace in Sardinia of the anthropomorphic prehistoric primate called &quot;Oreopithecus bambolii&quot; is dated to 8.5 million years ago. In 1996 a hominid finger bone, dated up to 250.000 BC, was found in a cave in the Logudoro region.

Modern humans appeared in the island during the Upper Paleolithic, a phalanx dated to 18000 BC had been found in the &quot;Corbeddu cave&quot;, near Oliena. Mesolithic human remains had been discovered at &quot;Su Coloru cave&quot; of Laerru but also in the south (Sirri, Arbus).

Already in the Stone Age, Monte Arci played an important role. The old volcano was one of the central places where obsidian was found and worked for cutting tools and arrowheads. Even now the volcanic glass can be found on the sides of the mountain.

The Neolithic began in Sardinia in the 6th millennium BC with the Cardial culture. Later, important cultures like the Ozieri culture and the Arzachena culture of the late Neolithic and the Abealzu-Filigosa and Monte Claro culture of the Chalcolithic period, developed in the island contemporaneously with the appearance of the megalithic phenomenon.

The dolmens culture, around the end of the 3rd millennium BC, passed with other typical material aspects of Western Europe (e.g. Bell Beaker) through by the Sardinian coast even in Sicily.

Prehistoric and Pre-nuragic monuments and constructions that characterise the Sardinian landscapes are the Domus de Janas (), the menhir and Statue menhir and the dolmens.

===Chronology of Pre-Nuragic Sardinia===
Archeological cultures of Sardinia in the pre-Nuragic period:
===Nuragic period===
Bronze Age Sardinia is characterised by stone structures called nuraghes, of which there are more than 8,000. The most famous is the complex of Barumini in the province of Medio Campidano. The nuraghes were mainly built in the period from about 1800 to 1200 BC, though many were used until the Roman period. Characteristics of this period are also the holy well temples (for example Santa Cristina, Paulilatino), the megara temples and the Giants&#x27; graves.

The Nuragic Sards also produced a vast collection of bronze statuettes and the so-called giants of Mont&#x27;e Prama, which might constitute the first anthropomorphic statues of Europe.

It is known that the Sardinians had contact with the Myceneans, who traded with the western Mediterranean. Contact with powerful cities of Crete, such as Kydonia, is clear from pottery recovered in archaeological excavations in Sardinia. The alleged connection with the Sherden, one of the sea peoples who invaded Egypt and other areas of eastern Mediterranean, has been supported by scholars like the professor Giovanni Ugas from the University of Cagliari; this hypothesis has been however opposed by other archaeologists and historians.

The name of the island could result from &quot;Sardus&quot; (known amongst the Romans as &quot;Sardus Pater&quot;), a mythological hero of the Nuragic pantheon.

==Early and classical antiquity==

===Phoenician settlement===

From the 8th century BC, Phoenicians founded several cities and strongholds on strategic points in the south and west of Sardinia, often peninsulas or islands near estuaries, easy to defend and natural harbours, such as Tharros, Bithia, Sulci, Nora and Caralis (Cagliari). The majority of the inhabitants in these cities were of indigenous nuragic stock while the Phoenician element was, although culturally predominant, in minority. The Phoenicians came originally from what is now Lebanon and founded a vast trading network in the Mediterranean. Sardinia had a special position because it was central in the Western Mediterranean between Carthage, Spain, the river Rh√¥ne and the Etruscan civilization area. The mining area of the Iglesiente was important for the metals lead and zinc. After the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians took over control in this part of the Mediterranean, around 510 BC, after which a first attempt of conquest of the island in 540 BC ended in failure. They expanded their influence to the western and southern coast from Bosa to Caralis, consolidating the existing Phoenician colonies, administered by plenipotentiaries called &quot;Suffetes&quot;, and founding new ones such as Olbia, Cornus and Neapolis; Tharros probably became the capital of the province. Carthage stressed the growing of grain and cereals and prohibited fruit trees.

Tharros, Nora, Bithia, Monte Sirai etc. are now important archaeological monuments where architecture and city planning can be studied.

===Roman Empire===

In 240 BC, in the course of the First Punic War, the Carthaginian mercenaries on the island revolted and gave the Romans, who some years earlier had defeated the Carthaginians in the naval battle of Sulci, the opportunity to land on Sardinia and occupy it. In 238 BC the Romans took over the whole island, without meeting any resistance. They took over an existing developed infrastructure and urbanized culture (at least in the plains). Along with Corsica it formed the province of Corsica et Sardinia, under a praetor. Together with Sicily it formed one of the main granaries of Rome until the Romans conquered Egypt in the 1st century BC.

A revolt, led by two Sardo-Punic notables from Cornus and Tharros, Hampsicora and Hanno, broke out after the crushing Roman defeat at Cannae (216 BC). A Roman army of 22,000 infantrymen and 1,200 cavalry, under Titus Manlius Torquatus, reached Sardinia landing in Caralis and defeating Hiostus, the son of Hampsicora, near Milis. The Romans then met the Carthaginian-Sardinian allied forces in the south of the island, defeating them in a pitched battle that took place between Sestu and Decimomannu, and killing 12,000 men. Another major revolt took place in 177-176 BC when the Balares and the Ilienses were defeated by Tiberius Gracchus, who, according to Livy, killed or enslaved about 80,000 natives. The last organized revolts were repressed by Marcus Caecilius Metellus in 115-111 BC and Titus Albucius in 106. However the Sardinians living in the impervious mountains of the interior resisted the Roman colonization well into Imperial times.

Punic culture remained strong during the first centuries of the Roman domination. However, in the long run, Romanization prevailed, and Latin became the speech of the majority of the inhabitants, ultimately developing into the modern Sardinian language. The Roman religion began to spread among Sardinians as well. Caralis, the provincial capital, Nora and Sulci obtained the status of Municipium within the 1st century AD and a Roman colony named Turris Libissonis (Porto Torres) was founded in the north-west while the village of Usellus become perphans a Roman colony under Trajan. Four great roads were built: two along the coasts and two in the interior connecting all the major cities.

During the Roman period, the geographer Ptolemy noted that Sardinia was inhabited by the following tribes, from north to south: the Tibulati and the Corsi, the Coracenses, the Carenses and the Cunusitani, the Salcitani and the Lucuidonenses, the √Üsaronenses, the √Üchilenenses (also called Cornenses), the Rucensi, the Celsitani and the Corpicenses, the Scapitani and the Siculensi, the Neapolitani and the Valentini, the Solcitani and the Noritani.

In the year 212 AD, every inhabitant of the empire became a Roman citizen by the Constitutio Antoniniana, better known as the &quot;Edict of Caracalla&quot;. At that time, many islanders from the &quot;Municipia&quot; and &quot;Coloniae&quot; were Roman citizens, while those living in the interior were not. Around the year 286 AD, Sardinia was incorporated into the Italian diocese during the empire of Diocletianus, and in 324 AD, under the rule of the emperor Constantine the Great, in the &quot;suburbicaria&quot; Italian diocese, until the conquest by the Vandals in 456 AD.

==Middle Ages==
===Vandals, Goths and Byzantines===

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Sardinia was subject to several conquests. In 456, the Vandals, an East Germanic tribe, coming from North Africa, occupied the coastal cities of the island; they imposed garrisons guarded by African auxiliaries, like the Mauri. The Vandals followed Arianism and deported a number of African Bishops in the island such as Fulgentius of Ruspe. In 533, Sardinia rebelled under the Vandal governor Godas, a Goth, who proclaimed himself &quot;rex&quot; of Sardinia, asking the Byzantines for aid.

In the summer of 533 Vandal forces (5,000 men and 120 ships), led by Tzazo, arrived in Sardinia to stifle Godas&#x27; rebellion and conquered Caralis, killing Godas and his followers. In early 534, the Vandals of Sardinia surrendered immediately to the Byzantines when faced with news of the Vandal collapse in Africa; thenceforth the island was part of the Byzantine Empire, included as a province in the Praetorian prefecture of Africa. The local governor sat in Caralis. During the Gothic Wars, much of the island fell easily to the Ostrogoths, but the final fall of the Germanic resistance in mainland Italy reassured Byzantine control. Sardinia was subsequently included in the Exarchate of Africa until its end by the Arabs in 698 AD, when the island was likely aggregated to the Exarchate of Ravenna. In 599 and during the 7th century, the Longobard fleet tried to attack Caralis and Turris Libissonis (Porto Torres), but in vain.

One of the few ethnic Sardinians known from this period was Ospitone, a leader of the &quot;Barbaricinos&quot; (people of Barbagia). According to the Pope Gregory I&#x27;s letters, a Romanized and Christianized area existed on the island (that of the &quot;provinciales&quot;) that co-existed with, in the interior, pagan or semi-pagan cultures (&quot;Gens Barbaricina&quot;). The ruler of one of the latter, Ospitone, converted to Christianity in 594 after a diplomatic exchange. Christianization however remained long influenced by eastern and Byzantine culture.
Other known religious figures of Sardinian origin of that period (5th‚Äì6th centuries) are Pope Hilarius and Pope Symmachus.

===Iberian invasions===

Starting from the 8th century, the Iberians from Denia and Zaragoza (recently conquered by Muslims) harassed the population of the coastal cities. Details about the political situation of Sardinia in the following centuries are scarce. Due to Saracen attacks, in the 9th century Tharros was abandoned in favor of Oristano, after more than 1,800 years of human occupation while Caralis was abandoned in favor of Santa Igia; numerous other coastal centres suffered the same fate (Nora, Sulci, Bithia, Cornus, Bosa, Olbia etc.). There was another Denia invasion in 1015‚àí16 from Balearics, led by MujƒÅhid al- øƒÄmirƒ´ (Latinized as &quot;Museto&quot;), the Denians attempt of invasion of the island was stopped by Sardinian Judicates with the support of the Fleets of the Maritime Republics of Pisa and Genoa, called by Pope Benedict VIII.

===Judicates (Judicados)===

From the mid-11th century the Judicates (&quot;held by judges&quot;) appeared. The title of &quot;Judex&quot; (judge, &quot;judike&quot; in medieval Sardinian) was an heir of that of the Byzantine governor after the creation of the Exarchate of Africa in 582 (&quot;Prases&quot; or &quot;Judex Provinciae&quot;). In the 8th and 9th centuries the four &quot;partes&quot; depending from Caralis grew increasingly independent, after that Byzantium was totally cut off from the Tyrrhenian Sea by the Muslim conquest of Sicily in 827. A letter from Pope Nicholas I in 864 mentions for the first time the Sardinian judges, and their autonomy is clear in a later letter by Pope John VIII, which defined them as &quot;Princes&quot;. A letter by Mieszko I to Pope John XV proves that the Judicates were known even in Poland, and that they played a prestigious role in medieval Europe.

During the judicial era Sardinia had some 300.000 inhabitants, of which slightly more than 1/3 were free. These were subjected to the authority of local &quot;curators&quot; (administrators), in turn subjected to the judge (who also administered justice and was the commander of the army). The church was also powerful, and at this time it had completely abandoned the Eastern Rite. The late 11th-century arrival of Benedictine, Camaldolese and other monks from the Italian Mezzogiorno, Lombardy and Provence, especially the monasteries of Montecassino, Saint-Victor de Marseille and Vallombrosa, boosted the agriculture in a land which was extremely underdeveloped. The &quot;condaghes&quot; (catalogues, cartularies) of the monasteries, which record property transactions, are an important source for the study of the island and its language in the 11th and 12th centuries. Evidence from the &quot;condaghes&quot; of San Pietro di Silki, in Sassari, and Santa Maria di Bonarcado concerning the children of slaves has been adduced to show that differences in agricultural lifestyles between regions may affect the survival rate of females, hypothetically through increased infanticide of baby girls. The abbacy of Santa Maria di Bonarcado contained more central, upland regions where a pastoral economy dominated and women were less economically useful; among children in that region, sex ratios are highly skewed in favour of men. On the other hand, in the region of San Pietro di Silki, less pastoral, child sex ratios are not skewed abnormally.

There were four (historically known) Judicates: Logudoro (or Torres), Cagliari (or Pluminos), Arborea and Gallura. Cagliari and Arborea and Logudoro (and perhaps Gallura) were united for a time in the 11th century.
The initiatives of the Gregorian reformers led to greater contact between Sardinia and the Italian peninsula, especially through the desires of the judges to establish monasteries with monks from continental monasteries at Montecassino and Marseille. By the 12th century, the Sardinian Judicates, though obscure, are visible through the mists of time. They professed allegiance to the Holy See, which put them under the authority of the Archdiocese of Pisa, superseding the ancient primacy of the Archdiocese of Cagliari on the island.

Often quarreling between one another, the Judicates made a great number of commercial concessions to the Pisans and the Genoese. The Repubbliche Marinare soon became the true masters of the Sardinian economy.

In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, all four Judicates passed to foreign dynasties and the local families were relegated to minor positions. Arborea passed to the Catalan House of Cervera (Cervera-Bas) in 1185, though this was contested for the next few decades. In 1188, Cagliari was conquered by the House of Massa from the Republic of Pisa. Gallura became by marriage ‚Äì it had been inherited by a woman, Elena ‚Äì a possession of the House of Visconti, another Pisan family, in 1207. Only Logudoro survived to the end under local Sardinian rulers. However, its end was early. It passed to Genoa and to the Doria and Malaspina families in 1259 after the death of its last judge, Adelasia. Only a year before the others Judicates and the Pisans besieged Santa Igia and deposed the last ruler of Cagliari William III. Gallura survived longer, but the enemies of the Visconti in Pisa soon removed the last judge, Nino, a friend of Dante Alighieri, in 1288.

About the same time, Sassari declared itself a free commune allied to Genoa. In the early 14th century, much of Eastern and Southern Sardinia, including Castel di Castro (Cagliari), was under the authority of Pisa and of the della Gherardesca family, who founded the important mining town of Villa di Chiesa (now Iglesias). Arborea, however, survived as the only indigenous kingdom until 1420. One of the most remarkable Sardinian figure of the Middle Ages, Eleanor of Arborea, was co-ruler of that region in the late 14th century; she laid the foundations for the laws that remained valid until 1827, the Carta de Logu.

In 1323 an Aragonese army, under Alfonso, son of King James II, disembarked near Palma di Sulcis, in Southern Sardinia. After the fall of Villa di Chiesa the Pisans were defeated again, both by land and sea, at Lucocisterna and in the gulf of Cagliari, and were forced to leave the island, maintaining only Castel di Castro until 1326. The Cagliari area as well as Gallura thus became part of the first nucleus of the Kingdom of Sardinia, established nominally by Pope Boniface VIII in 1297, that was included in the Crown of Aragon.

In 1353 Marianus IV of Arborea, allied with the Doria family, waged war against the Aragonese, occupying much of the island but unable to capture Cagliari. The Peace of Sanluri (1355) ushered in a period of tranquility, but hostilities were resumed in 1365, with Arborea, led by Marianus IV and then, from 1391, by Brancaleone Doria, initially able to capture much of the Island. However, in 1409 the Aragonese crushed a Genoese fleet coming in support the Sardinians, and destroyed the Judicial army at the Battle of Sanluri. Oristano, the Arborean capital, fell on 29 March 1410. William II of Narbonne, the last Judge of Arborea, sold his remaining territories to the Aragonese in 1420, in exchange for 100,000 gold florins.

In the 1470s an important revolt against the Aragonese was led by Leonardo Alagon, marquess of Oristano, who managed to defeat the viceroyal army but was later crushed at the Battle of Macomer (1478). The island endured attacks from North African pirates and a series of plagues in 1582, 1652 and 1655.

In 1527, during the Franco-Spanish War, a French army of 4000 men led by the Italian Renzo da Ceri attacked the north of the island, besieging Castellaragonese and sacking Sorso and then Sassari for almost a month.

In 1566 the first typography of Sardinia was established in Cagliari, while in 1607 and 1617 were founded the University of Cagliari and the University of Sassari.

In the late 15th and in the early 16th century the Spaniards built watchtowers all along the coast (today called &quot;Spanish towers&quot;) to protect the island against Ottoman incursions. In 1637 a French fleet led by Henri, Count of Harcourt sacked Oristano for about a week.

===Kingdom of Sardinia under the House of Savoy===

Sardinia was disputed between 1700 and 1720. After the War of the Spanish Succession it was assigned to Emperor Charles VI in 1714, Philip V of Spain briefly recovered the island in 1717, but in 1720 the European powers assigned Sicily to Charles VI and Sardinia to the House of Savoy, so Vittorio Amedeo II became the King of Sardinia.

In 1793 Sardinians twice defeated the French invaders (French expedition to Sardinia). On 23 February 1793, Domenico Millelire, in command of the Sardinian fleet, defeated near the Maddalena archipelago the fleets of the French Republic, which included with the rank of lieutenant, the young and future Emperor of France Napoleon Bonaparte. Millelire received the first Gold Medal of Military Valor of the Italian Navy. In the same month, Sardinians stopped the attempted French landing on the beach of Quartu Sant&#x27;Elena, near the Capital of Cagliari. Because of these successes, the representatives of nobility and clergy (&quot;Stamenti&quot;) formulated five requests addressed to the King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia in order to have the same rights as the Italian mainlanders, but they met with a refusal. Because of this discontent, on 28 April 1794, during an uprising in Cagliari, two Piedmontese officials were killed. That was the start of a revolt (called the &quot;Moti rivoluzionari sardi&quot; or &quot;Vespri sardi&quot;) all over the island, which culminated on 28 April 1794 (commemorated today as &quot;sa die de sa Sardigna&quot;) with the expulsion of the officers for a few days from the capital Cagliari. On 28 December 1795, insurgents in Sassari demonstrating against feudalism, mainly from the region of Logudoro, occupied the city. On 13 February 1796, in order to prevent the spread of the revolt, the viceroy Filippo Vivalda gave to the Sardinian magistrate Giovanni Maria Angioy the role of Alternos, which meant a substitute of the viceroy himself. Angioy moved from Cagliari to Sassari, and during his journey almost all the villages joined the uprising, demanding an end to feudalism and aiming to declare the island to be an independent republic, but once he was outnumbered by loyalist forces he fled to Paris and sought support from the French to invade Sardinia and make it an independent Republic.

In 1799 King Charles Emmanuel IV was ousted from Piedmont by the French army, and moved his court to Cagliari (his brother and successor Victor Emmanuel I returned to Turin only in 1814). At the end of the 18th century, the Universities of Sassari and Cagliari were restored. In 1820, the Savoyards imposed the &quot;Enclosures Act&quot; (&quot;editto delle chiudende&quot;) on the island, a legislative act which turned the land&#x27;s traditional collective ownership, a cultural and economic cornerstone of Sardinia since the Nuragic times, into private property. This gave rise to many abuses, as the reform favoured the landholders while excluding the poor Sardinian farmers and shepherds, who witnessed the abolition of the communal rights and the sale of the land. Many local rebellions like the Nuorese &quot;Su Connottu&quot; (&quot;The Already Known&quot; in Sardinian) riot in 1868, all repressed by the King&#x27;s army, resulted in an attempt to return to the past and reaffirm the right to use the once common land.
In 1847, under King Charles Albert, all the administrative differences between Sardinia and the Italian mainland were abolished through the so-called Perfect fusion: this manoveur had been presented as the only possible way to grant equal rights to all inhabitants of the Kingdom, which would become a unitary state and the basic legislation of the future united Italy as well.

New urban plans and new villages (for example Carloforte, Calasetta and Santa Teresa di Gallura) were realised between the 18th and the 19th centuries. They often followed the urban model of Turin, which now was the capital of the Reign of Italy. New infrastructures were built under King Carlo Felice. The main road from the south (Cagliari) to the north (Sassari) was enhanced (the road still exists today and it still bears the name of Carlo Felice). Also, the first ferry route between the island and Genoa was established, using steamboats such as the Gulnara. The first railway was inaugurated in 1871. By the end of the 19th century the Royal Railways had received 30 locomotives, 106 passenger cars, and 436 cargo cars.

The economy was focused mainly on the primary sector (agriculture and sheep husbandry) and on mining. The majority of mining societies operating in Sardinia depended on non-Sardinian capital money. However, in 1848 the Sardinian entrepreneur Giovanni Antonio Sanna achieved the property of the mine of Montevecchio, thus becoming the 3rd richest man of the Kingdom.

==United Italy==
===Kingdom of Italy===
Most Sardinian forests were cut down at this time, in order to provide the Piedmontese with raw materials, like wood, used to make railway sleepers on the mainland. The extension of primary natural forests, praised by every traveller visiting Sardinia, would in fact be reduced to little more than 100,000 hectares at the end of the century.

With the Unification of Italy in 1861, the Kingdom of Sardinia became the Kingdom of Italy. Since 1855 the national hero Giuseppe Garibaldi bought most of the island of Caprera in the Maddalena archipelago, where he moved because of the loss of his home town of Nice. His house, farm and tomb are now the most visited Sardinian museum (&quot;Compendio Garibaldino&quot;).

In 1883 the first train travelled between Cagliari and Sassari, and in these decades were made all the modern public works: roads, dams, schools, sewers and aqueducts, mainly in the cities.

During the First World War the Sardinian soldiers of the Brigata Sassari distinguished themselves, with several being decorated with gold medals and other honours. Following the war, in occasion of Irish independence the ex-combatants organized themselves into a Sardinian nationalist movement, the Sardinian Action Party, but was eventually outlawed in 1926. In 1924, the Italian Parliament led by Benito Mussolini passed a bill (called &quot;la legge del miliardo&quot;) to establish a budget of one billion &quot;lire&quot; to develop infrastructure in order to encourage economic development. However, only a portion of the designated funds were ever distributed, and mainly in Cagliari.

The writer Grazia Deledda won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1926.
During the Fascist period, with the implementation of the policy of autarky, several swamps around the island were drained and new agrarian communities founded. The main communities were in the area of Oristano, where the village of Mussolinia (now called Arborea), populated by people from Veneto and Friuli, was located, and in the area adjacent the city of Alghero, within the region of Nurra, where Fertilia was built, settled, after the World War II, by Istrians and Dalmatians from Yugoslavia. Also established during that time was the city of Carbonia, which became the main centre of mining activity. Works to drain the numerous waste lands and the growth of mining activities favoured the arrival of numerous settlers and immigrants from the Mainland.

The repression by the Fascist regime of its opponents within the region was ruthless. Rural Sardinia showed little interest in the Fascist state, while the urban bourgeoisie from the cities, some of which being repopulated by Italian mainlanders, were its staunchest supporters on the island. Antonio Gramsci, one of the founders of Italian Communist Party, was arrested and died in prison. The anarchist Michele Schirru was executed after a failed assassination plot against Benito Mussolini.

During World War II Sardinia was a theatre of bombing; from 1940 the Axis used its airfields for attacks across the Mediterranean, while from 1943 the island was under air attack from the Allies and the cities of Cagliari and Alghero were heavily bombed. (Air raids had also been conducted by an aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy in September 1940, shortly after Italy&#x27;s entry into the war.) German troops were stationed on Sardinia and Corsica ‚Äì occupied by the Italians ‚Äì in 1943. By that July, most airbases in Sardinia had been rendered inoperable by Allied aerial bombing. A number of diversionary raids on Sardinia, Operation Hawthorn, were carried out by the Allies in summer 1943 to distract Axis attention from the upcoming invasion of Sicily, Operation Husky. Operation Mincemeat was an elaborate diversion implemented by the Allies to persuade the Axis&#x27;s intelligence that their planned invasion of southern Europe would take place in the Balkans and Italy and would feature an invasion of Sardinia. This succeeded in diverting Axis troops from Sicily, the real target of the invasion.
The war ended in Sardinia in September 1943, with the withdrawal of the Wehrmacht to Corsica following the surrender of Italy to the Allies under the Armistice of Cassibile, and the island, together with Southern Italy, became free. Allied forces landed on Sardinia on 14 September 1943 and the last German troops were expelled on the 18th.

===Italian Republic and Sardinian autonomy===
In 1946 more than 60% of Sardinians voted in favour of monarchy, just as much as in Southern Italy, but a few days later Italy became a Republic. In 1948 Sardinia obtained the status of autonomous region which, while being the highest degree of self-governance since the Judicates era, fell short of many Sardinians&#x27; expectations. The first regional elections were held on 8 May 1949. By 1951, malaria was successfully eliminated with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation. In the same years the Italian economic miracle led to the birth of Sardinian tourist &quot;boom&quot;, mainly focused on beach holidays and luxury tourism, such as in Costa Smeralda. Today about ten million people visit the island every year.
With the increase in tourism, coal decreased in importance. However, shortly after the Second World War a ponderous industrialization effort was commenced, the so-called &quot;Piani di Rinascita&quot; (Rebirth Plans), with the initiation of major infrastructure projects on the island. This included the realization of new dams and roads, reforestation, agricultural zones on reclaimed marsh land, and large industrial complexes (primarily oil refineries and related petrochemical operations). These efforts to create jobs have largely failed due to the high costs of transportation that could not compensate the cheap labor. In the 1950s and 1960s many Sardinians migrated to Northern and Central Italy (Lombardy, Piedmont, Liguria, Tuscany and Rome) and the rest of Europe (mostly in Germany, France and Belgium) but also from the interior of the island to the coastal cities of Cagliari, Olbia and Sassari. In the early 1960s with the creation of petrochemical industries, thousands of ex-farmers became specialised workers, and some others would commence to work on the newly established military bases, created primarily for the NATO. Even now, around 60% of all Italian and US military installations in Italy are on Sardinia, whose area is less than one-tenth of all the Italian territory and whose population is little more than the 2,5%; furthermore, they comprise over 35.000 hectares used for experimental weapons testing, where 80% of the military explosives in Italy are used. Ever since, there has always been a local protest movement expressing deep concern over the environmental degradation the military activities would cause.

Nevertheless, since 1973 the international oil crisis caused the firing of thousands of workers employed in the petrochemical industry. Especially because of the failed industrialization plans, Sardinia is actually the most polluted region in Italy, with over 445,000 hectares of contaminated soil still to be remediated.

Among other factors, economic crisis and unemployment aggravated the crime rate, as evidenced by the increasing frequency of phenomena such as kidnappings and political subversion of the Anonima sarda: between the 1970s and the early 1980s, some communist and nationalist militant groups, the most famous being &quot;Barbagia Rossa&quot; and the Sardinian Armed Movement (MAS), claimed several terrorist attempts. In the span of just two years (1987‚Äì1988), 224 bombing attacks were reported.

In 1983, for the first time ever a militant of a nationalist party, the Sardinian Action Party (&quot;Partidu Sardu&quot;-&quot;Partito Sardo d&#x27;Azione&quot;), was elected president of the regional parliament. Nevertheless, in the 1980s a number of even more radical pro-independence movements were born, some even managing to evolve into parties in the 1990s. In 1999, after a long period of Italian assimilation policies in Sardinia, the languages indigenous to the island were eventually recognized as &quot;historical language minorities&quot; of the Country, and allowed to formally enjoy co-official status alongside Italian.
Also noticeable is the difference between coastal regions and the inland. Coastal regions have always been more open to outside influences. Nowadays Sardinia is most known for its coasts (La Maddalena, Costa Smeralda), the north-western coast near Sassari (Alghero, Stintino, Castelsardo) and Cagliari, because these are easily reachable by ship and by plane.

Today Sardinia is a phasing-in EU region, featured by a diversified economy, mainly focused on tourism and the tertiary. The economic efforts of last twenty years have reduced the supposed handicap of insularity, for example with low cost air companies and information and informatic technologies, thanks to the CRS4 (Center for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia). The CRS4 developed the first Italian website, and invented the webmail, in 1995, that brought to the birth of several telecommunication companies and internet service providers based on the island, such as Video On Line (1993), Tiscali (1998) and Andala UMTS (1999).

<text>Jacques Derrida (; ; born Jackie √âlie Derrida; 15 July 1930 ‚Äì 9 October 2004) was a French Algerian philosopher. He developed the philosophy of deconstruction, which he utilized in a number of his texts, and which was developed through close readings of the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure and Husserlian and Heideggerian phenomenology. He is one of the major figures associated with post-structuralism and postmodern philosophy although he distanced himself from post-structuralism and disavowed the word &quot;postmodernity&quot;.

During his career, Derrida published over 40 books, together with hundreds of essays and public presentations. He has had a significant influence on the humanities and social sciences, including philosophy, literature, law, anthropology, historiography, applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, music, architecture, and political theory.

Into the 2000s, his work retained major academic influence throughout the United States, continental Europe, South America and all other countries where continental philosophy has been predominant, particularly in debates around ontology, epistemology (especially concerning social sciences), ethics, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and the philosophy of language. For the last two decades of his life, Derrida was Professor in Humanities at the University of California, Irvine. In most of the Anglosphere, where analytic philosophy is dominant, Derrida&#x27;s influence is most presently felt in literary studies due to his longstanding interest in language and his association with prominent literary critics. He also influenced architecture (in the form of deconstructivism), music (especially in the musical atmosphere of hauntology), art, and art criticism.

Particularly in his later writings, Derrida addressed ethical and political themes in his work. Some critics consider &quot;Speech and Phenomena&quot; (1967) to be his most important work, while others cite &quot;Of Grammatology&quot; (1967), &quot;Writing and Difference&quot; (1967), and &quot;Margins of Philosophy&quot; (1972). These writings influenced various activists and political movements. He became a well-known and influential public figure, while his approach to philosophy and the notorious abstruseness of his work made him controversial.

==Early life and education==
Derrida was born on 15 July 1930, in a summer home in El Biar (Algiers), Algeria, to Ha√Øm Aaron Prosper Charles (known as &quot;Aim√©&quot;) Derrida (1896‚Äì1970), who worked all his life for the wine and spirits company Tachet, including as a travelling salesman (his son reflected the job was &quot;exhausting&quot; and &quot;humiliating&quot;, his father forced to be a &quot;docile employee&quot; to the extent of waking early to do the accounts at the dining-room table), and Georgette Sultana Esther (1901‚Äì1991), daughter of Mo√Øse Safar. His family was Sephardic Jewish (originally from Toledo) and became French in 1870 when the Cr√©mieux Decree granted full French citizenship to the Jews of Algeria. His parents named him &quot;Jackie&quot;, &quot;which they considered to be an American name&quot;, although he would later adopt a more &quot;correct&quot; version of his first name when he moved to Paris; some reports indicate that he was named Jackie after the American child actor Jackie Coogan, who had become well known around the world via his role in the 1921 Charlie Chaplin film &quot;The Kid&quot;. He was also given the middle name √âlie after his paternal uncle Eug√®ne Eliahou, at his circumcision; this name was not recorded on his birth certificate unlike those of his siblings, and he would later call it his &quot;hidden name&quot;.

Derrida was the third of five children. His elder brother Paul Mo√Øse died at less than three months old, the year before Derrida was born, leading him to suspect throughout his life his role as a replacement for his deceased brother. Derrida spent his youth in Algiers and in El-Biar.

On the first day of the school year in 1942, French administrators in Algeria‚Äîimplementing antisemitism quotas set by the Vichy government‚Äîexpelled Derrida from his lyc√©e. He secretly skipped school for a year rather than attend the Jewish lyc√©e formed by displaced teachers and students, and also took part in numerous football competitions (he dreamed of becoming a professional player). In this adolescent period, Derrida found in the works of philosophers and writers (such as Rousseau, Nietzsche, and Gide) an instrument of revolt against family and society. His reading also included Camus and Sartre.

In the late 1940s, he attended the , in Algiers; in 1949 he moved to Paris, attending the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand, where his professor of philosophy was √âtienne Borne. At that time he prepared for his entrance exam to the prestigious √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS); after failing the exam on his first try, he passed it on the second, and was admitted in 1952. On his first day at ENS, Derrida met Louis Althusser, with whom he became friends. A professor of his, Jan Czarnecki, was a progressive Protestant who would become a signer of the Manifesto of the 121. After visiting the Husserl Archive in Leuven, Belgium (1953‚Äì1954), he completed his master&#x27;s degree in philosophy (&quot;&quot;) on Edmund Husserl (see below). He then passed the highly competitive &quot;agr√©gation&quot; exam in 1956. Derrida received a grant for studies at Harvard University, and he spent the 1956‚Äì57 academic year reading James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; at the Widener Library.

==Career==
During the Algerian War of Independence of 1954‚Äì1962, Derrida asked to teach soldiers&#x27; children in lieu of military service, teaching French and English from 1957 to 1959.
Following the war, from 1960 to 1964, Derrida taught philosophy at the Sorbonne, where he was an assistant of Suzanne Bachelard (daughter of Gaston Bachelard), Georges Canguilhem, Paul Ric≈ìur (who in these years coined the term &quot;hermeneutics of suspicion&quot;), and Jean Wahl. His wife, Marguerite, gave birth to their first child, Pierre, in 1963. In 1964, on the recommendation of Louis Althusser and Jean Hyppolite, Derrida got a permanent teaching position at the ENS, which he kept until 1984. In 1965 Derrida began an association with the &quot;Tel Quel&quot; group of literary and philosophical theorists, which lasted for seven years. Derrida&#x27;s subsequent distance from the &quot;Tel Quel&quot; group, after 1971, was connected to his reservations about their embrace of Maoism and of the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

With &quot;Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences&quot;, his contribution to a 1966 colloquium on structuralism at Johns Hopkins University, his work began to gain international prominence. At the same colloquium Derrida would meet Jacques Lacan and Paul de Man, the latter an important interlocutor in the years to come. A second son, Jean, was born in 1967. In the same year, Derrida published his first three books‚Äî&quot;Writing and Difference&quot;, &quot;Speech and Phenomena&quot;, and &quot;Of Grammatology&quot;.

In 1980, he received his first honorary doctorate (from Columbia University) and was awarded his State doctorate (&quot;doctorat d&#x27;√âtat&quot;) by submitting to the University of Paris ten of his previously published books in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project under the title &quot;&quot; (&quot;Inscription in Philosophy: Research on the Interpretation of Writing&quot;). The text of Derrida&#x27;s defense was based on an abandoned draft thesis he had prepared in 1957 under the direction of Jean Hyppolite at the ENS entitled &quot;The Ideality of the Literary Object&quot; (&quot;&quot;); his 1980 dissertation was subsequently published in English translation as &quot;The Time of a Thesis: Punctuations&quot;. In 1983 Derrida collaborated with Ken McMullen on the film &quot;Ghost Dance&quot;. Derrida appears in the film as himself and also contributed to the script.

Derrida traveled widely and held a series of visiting and permanent positions. Derrida became full professor () at the in Paris from 1984 (he had been elected at the end of 1983). With Fran√ßois Ch√¢telet and others he in 1983 co-founded the (CIPH; &#x27;International college of philosophy&#x27;), an institution intended to provide a location for philosophical research which could not be carried out elsewhere in the academia. He was elected as its first president. In 1985 Sylviane Agacinski gave birth to Derrida&#x27;s third child, Daniel.

On 8 May 1985, Derrida was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, to Class IV ‚Äì Humanities, Section 3 -Criticism and Philology.

In 1986 Derrida became Professor of the Humanities at the University of California, Irvine, where he taught until shortly before his death in 2004. His papers were filed in the university archives. When Derrida&#x27;s colleague, Dragan Kujundzic, was accused of sexual assault, Derrida wrote a letter to then-Chancellor Cicerone saying &quot;if the scandalous procedure&quot; against Kujundzic was not &quot;interrupted or cancelled,&quot; he would end all his &quot;relations with UCI.&quot; Regarding his archival papers, there would be &quot;another consequence: since I never take back what I have given, my papers would of course remain the property of UCI and the Special Collections department of the library. However, it goes without saying that the spirit in which I contributed to the constitution of these archives (which is still underway and growing every year) would have been seriously damaged. Without renouncing my commitments, I would regret having made them and would reduce their fulfillment to the barest minimum.&quot; After Derrida&#x27;s death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI&#x27;s archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida&#x27;s widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine&#x27;s collection, although it dropped the suit in 2007.

Derrida was a regular visiting professor at several other major American and European universities, including Johns Hopkins University, Yale University, New York University, Stony Brook University, The New School for Social Research, and European Graduate School.

He was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Cambridge (1992), Columbia University, The New School for Social Research, the University of Essex, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the University of Silesia, the University of Coimbra, the University of Athens, and many others around the world. In 2001, he received the Adorno-Preis from the University of Frankfurt.

Derrida&#x27;s honorary degree at Cambridge was protested by leading philosophers in the analytic tradition. Philosophers including Quine, Marcus, and Armstrong wrote a letter to the university objecting that &quot;Derrida&#x27;s work does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour,&quot; and &quot;Academic status based on what seems to us to be little more than semi-intelligible attacks upon the values of reason, truth, and scholarship is not, we submit, sufficient grounds for the awarding of an honorary degree in a distinguished university&quot;.

Late in his life, Derrida participated in making two biographical documentaries, &quot;D&#x27;ailleurs, Derrida&quot; (&quot;Derrida&#x27;s Elsewhere&quot;) by Safaa Fathy (1999), and &quot;Derrida&quot; by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman (2002).

On 19 February 2003, with the 2003 invasion of Iraq impending, moderated a debate entitled &quot;Pourquoi La Guerre Aujourd&#x27;hui?&quot; between Derrida and Jean Baudrillard, co-hosted by &quot;Major&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Studies in Psychoanalysis&quot; and &quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&quot;. The debate discussed the relation between terrorist attacks and the invasion.

==Personal life and death==
In June 1957, he married the psychoanalyst Marguerite Aucouturier in Boston.

Derrida was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2002.
He died during surgery in a hospital in Paris in the early hours of 9 October 2004.

At the time of his death, Derrida had agreed to go for the summer to University of Heidelberg as holder of the Gadamer professorship, whose invitation was expressed by the hermeneutic philosopher himself before his death. Peter Hommelhoff, Rector at Heidelberg by that time, would summarize Derrida&#x27;s place as: &quot;Beyond the boundaries of philosophy as an academic discipline he was a leading intellectual figure not only for the humanities but for the cultural perception of a whole age.&quot;

==Philosophy==

Derrida referred to himself as a historian. He questioned assumptions of the Western philosophical tradition and also more broadly Western culture. By questioning the dominant discourses, and trying to modify them, he attempted to democratize the university scene and to politicize it. Derrida called his challenge to the assumptions of Western culture &quot;deconstruction&quot;. On some occasions, Derrida referred to deconstruction as a radicalization of a certain spirit of Marxism.

With his detailed readings of works from Plato to Rousseau to Heidegger, Derrida frequently argues that Western philosophy has uncritically allowed metaphorical depth models to govern its conception of language and consciousness. He sees these often unacknowledged assumptions as part of a &quot;metaphysics of presence&quot; to which philosophy has bound itself. This &quot;logocentrism&quot;, Derrida argues, creates &quot;marked&quot; or hierarchized binary oppositions that have an effect on everything from the conception of speech&#x27;s relation to writing to the understanding of racial difference. Deconstruction is an attempt to expose and undermine such &quot;metaphysics&quot;.

Derrida approaches texts as constructed around binary oppositions which all speech has to articulate if it intends to make any sense whatsoever. This approach to text is, in a broad sense, influenced by the semiology of Ferdinand de Saussure. Saussure, considered to be one of the fathers of structuralism, posited that terms get their meaning in reciprocal determination with other terms inside language.

Perhaps Derrida&#x27;s most quoted and famous assertion, which appears in an essay on Rousseau in his book &quot;Of Grammatology&quot; (1967), is the statement that &quot;there is no outside-text&quot; (). Critics of Derrida have been often accused of having mistranslated the phrase in French to suggest he had written &quot;&quot; (&quot;There is nothing outside the text&quot;) and of having widely disseminated this translation to make it appear that Derrida is suggesting that nothing exists but words. Derrida once explained that this assertion &quot;which for some has become a sort of slogan, in general so badly understood, of deconstruction ... means nothing else: there is nothing outside context. In this form, which says exactly the same thing, the formula would doubtless have been less shocking.&quot;

===Early works===
Derrida began his career examining the limits of phenomenology. His first lengthy academic manuscript, written as a dissertation for his and submitted in 1954, concerned the work of Edmund Husserl. Gary Banham has said that the dissertation is &quot;in many respects the most ambitious of Derrida&#x27;s interpretations with Husserl, not merely in terms of the number of works addressed but also in terms of the extraordinarily focused nature of its investigation.&quot; In 1962 he published &quot;Edmund Husserl&#x27;s Origin of Geometry: An Introduction&quot;, which contained his own translation of Husserl&#x27;s essay. Many elements of Derrida&#x27;s thought were already present in this work. In the interviews collected in &quot;Positions&quot; (1972), Derrida said: 
Derrida first received major attention outside France with his lecture, &quot;Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences,&quot; delivered at Johns Hopkins University in 1966 (and subsequently included in &quot;Writing and Difference&quot;). The conference at which this paper was delivered was concerned with structuralism, then at the peak of its influence in France, but only beginning to gain attention in the United States. Derrida differed from other participants by his lack of explicit commitment to structuralism, having already been critical of the movement. He praised the accomplishments of structuralism but also maintained reservations about its internal limitations; this has led US academics to label his thought as a form of post-structuralism.

The effect of Derrida&#x27;s paper was such that by the time the conference proceedings were published in 1970, the title of the collection had become &quot;The Structuralist Controversy&quot;. The conference was also where he met Paul de Man, who would be a close friend and source of great controversy, as well as where he first met the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, with whose work Derrida had a mixed relationship.

===Phenomenology vs structuralism debate (1959)===
In the early 1960s, Derrida began speaking and writing publicly, addressing the most topical debates at the time. One of these was the new and increasingly fashionable movement of structuralism, which was being widely favoured as the successor to the phenomenology approach, the latter having been started by Husserl sixty years earlier. Derrida&#x27;s countercurrent take on the issue, at a prominent international conference, was so influential that it reframed the discussion from a celebration of the triumph of structuralism to a &quot;phenomenology vs structuralism debate&quot;.

Phenomenology, as envisioned by Husserl, is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since Plato in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual&#x27;s &quot;lived experience&quot;; for those with a more phenomenological bent, the goal was to understand experience by comprehending and describing its genesis, the process of its emergence from an origin or event. For the structuralists, this was a false problem, and the &quot;depth&quot; of experience could in fact only be an effect of structures which are not themselves experiential.

In that context, in 1959, Derrida asked the question: Must not structure have a genesis, and must not the origin, the point of genesis, be &quot;already&quot; structured, in order to be the genesis &quot;of&quot; something? In other words, every structural or &quot;synchronic&quot; phenomenon has a history, and the structure cannot be understood without understanding its genesis. At the same time, in order that there be movement or potential, the origin cannot be some pure unity or simplicity, but must already be articulated‚Äîcomplex‚Äîsuch that from it a &quot;diachronic&quot; process can emerge. This original complexity must not be understood as an original &quot;positing&quot;, but more like a default of origin, which Derrida refers to as iterability, inscription, or textuality. It is this thought of originary complexity that sets Derrida&#x27;s work in motion, and from which all of its terms are derived, including &quot;deconstruction&quot;.

Derrida&#x27;s method consisted in demonstrating the forms and varieties of this originary complexity, and their multiple consequences in many fields. He achieved this by conducting thorough, careful, sensitive, and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts, to determine what aspects of those texts run counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis). By demonstrating the aporias and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways in which this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects.

===1967‚Äì1972===
Derrida&#x27;s interests crossed disciplinary boundaries, and his knowledge of a wide array of diverse material was reflected in the three collections of work published in 1967: &quot;Speech and Phenomena&quot;, &quot;Of Grammatology&quot; (initially submitted as a thesis under Maurice de Gandillac), and &quot;Writing and Difference&quot;.

On several occasions, Derrida has acknowledged his debt to Husserl and Heidegger, and stated that without them he would not have said a single word. Among the questions asked in these essays are &quot;What is &#x27;meaning&#x27;, what are its historical relationships to what is purportedly identified under the rubric &#x27;voice&#x27; as a value of presence, presence of the object, presence of meaning to consciousness, self-presence in so called living speech and in self-consciousness?&quot; In another essay in &quot;Writing and Difference&quot; entitled &quot;Violence and Metaphysics: An Essay on the Thought of Emmanuel Levinas&quot;, the roots of another major theme in Derrida&#x27;s thought emerge: the Other as opposed to the Same &quot;Deconstructive analysis deprives the present of its prestige and exposes it to something &quot;tout autre&quot;, &quot;wholly other&quot;, beyond what is foreseeable from the present, beyond the horizon of the &quot;same&quot;.&quot; Other than Rousseau, Husserl, Heidegger and Levinas, these three books discussed, and/or relied upon, the works of many philosophers and authors, including linguist Saussure, Hegel, Foucault, Bataille, Descartes, anthropologist L√©vi-Strauss, paleontologist Leroi-Gourhan, psychoanalyst Freud, and writers such as Jab√®s and Artaud.

This collection of three books published in 1967 elaborated Derrida&#x27;s theoretical framework. Derrida attempts to approach the very heart of the Western intellectual tradition, characterizing this tradition as &quot;a search for a transcendental being that serves as the origin or guarantor of meaning&quot;. The attempt to &quot;ground the meaning relations constitutive of the world in an instance that itself lies outside all relationality&quot; was referred to by Heidegger as logocentrism, and Derrida argues that the philosophical enterprise is &quot;essentially&quot; logocentric, and that this is a paradigm inherited from Judaism and Hellenism. He in turn describes logocentrism as phallocratic, patriarchal and masculinist. Derrida contributed to &quot;the understanding of certain deeply hidden philosophical presuppositions and prejudices in Western culture&quot;, arguing that the whole philosophical tradition rests on arbitrary dichotomous categories (such as sacred/profane, signifier/signified, mind/body), and that any text contains implicit hierarchies, &quot;by which an order is imposed on reality and by which a subtle repression is exercised, as these hierarchies exclude, subordinate, and hide the various potential meanings.&quot; Derrida refers to his procedure for uncovering and unsettling these dichotomies as deconstruction of Western culture.

In 1968, he published his influential essay &quot;Plato&#x27;s Pharmacy&quot; in the French journal &quot;Tel Quel&quot;. This essay was later collected in &quot;Dissemination&quot;, one of three books published by Derrida in 1972, along with the essay collection &quot;Margins of Philosophy&quot; and the collection of interviews entitled &quot;Positions&quot;.

===1973‚Äì1980===
Starting in 1972, Derrida produced on average more than one book per year. Derrida continued to produce important works, such as &quot;Glas&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond&quot; (1980).

Derrida received increasing attention in the United States after 1972, where he was a regular visiting professor and lecturer at several major American universities. In the 1980s, during the American culture wars, conservatives started a dispute over Derrida&#x27;s influence and legacy upon American intellectuals, and claimed that he influenced American literary critics and theorists more than academic philosophers.

===&quot;Of Spirit&quot; (1987)===
On 14 March 1987, Derrida presented at the CIPH conference entitled &quot;Heidegger: Open Questions&quot;, a lecture which was published in October 1987 as &quot;Of Spirit: Heidegger and the Question&quot;. It follows the shifting role of &quot;Geist&quot; (spirit) through Heidegger&#x27;s work, noting that, in 1927, &quot;spirit&quot; was one of the philosophical terms that Heidegger set his sights on dismantling. With his Nazi political engagement in 1933, however, Heidegger came out as a champion of the &quot;German Spirit&quot;, and only withdrew from an exalting interpretation of the term in 1953. Derrida asks, &quot;What of this meantime?&quot; His book connects in a number of respects with his long engagement of Heidegger (such as &quot;The Ends of Man&quot; in &quot;Margins of Philosophy&quot;, his Paris seminar on philosophical nationality and nationalism in the mid-1980s, and the essays published in English as &quot;Geschlecht&quot; and &quot;Geschlecht II&quot;). He considers &quot;four guiding threads&quot; of Heideggerian philosophy that form &quot;the knot of this &quot;Geflecht&quot; [braid]&quot;: &quot;the question of the question&quot;, &quot;the essence of technology&quot;, &quot;the discourse of animality&quot;, and &quot;epochality&quot; or &quot;the hidden teleology or the narrative order.&quot;

&quot;Of Spirit&quot; contributes to the long debate on Heidegger&#x27;s Nazism and appeared at the same time as the French publication of a book by a previously unknown Chilean writer, Victor Far√≠as, who charged that Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy amounted to a wholehearted endorsement of the Nazi &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) faction. Derrida responded to Far√≠as in an interview, &quot;Heidegger, the Philosopher&#x27;s Hell&quot; and a subsequent article, &quot;Comment donner raison? How to Concede, with Reasons?&quot; He called Far√≠as a weak reader of Heidegger&#x27;s thought, adding that much of the evidence Far√≠as and his supporters touted as new had long been known within the philosophical community.

===1990s: political and ethical themes===
Some have argued that Derrida&#x27;s work took a political and ethical &quot;turn&quot; in the 1990s. Texts cited as evidence of such a turn include &quot;Force of Law&quot; (1990), as well as &quot;Specters of Marx&quot; (1994) and &quot;Politics of Friendship&quot; (1994). Some refer to &quot;The Gift of Death&quot; as evidence that he began more directly applying deconstruction to the relationship between ethics and religion. In this work, Derrida interprets passages from the Bible, particularly on Abraham and the Sacrifice of Isaac, and from S√∏ren Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;.

However, scholars such as Leonard Lawlor, Robert Magliola, and Nicole Anderson have argued that the &quot;turn&quot; has been exaggerated. Some, including Derrida himself, have argued that much of the philosophical work done in his &quot;political turn&quot; can be dated to earlier essays.

Derrida develops an ethicist view respecting to hospitality, exploring the idea that two types of hospitalities exist, conditional and unconditional. Though this contributed to the works of many scholars, Derrida was seriously criticized for this.

Derrida&#x27;s contemporary readings of Emmanuel Levinas, Walter Benjamin, Carl Schmitt, Jan Patoƒçka, on themes such as law, justice, responsibility, and friendship, had a significant impact on fields beyond philosophy. Derrida and Deconstruction influenced aesthetics, literary criticism, architecture, film theory, anthropology, sociology, historiography, law, psychoanalysis, theology, feminism, gay and lesbian studies and political theory. Jean-Luc Nancy, Richard Rorty, Geoffrey Hartman, Harold Bloom, Rosalind Krauss, H√©l√®ne Cixous, Julia Kristeva, Duncan Kennedy, Gary Peller, Drucilla Cornell, Alan Hunt, Hayden White, Mario Kopiƒá, and Alun Munslow are some of the authors who have been influenced by deconstruction.

Derrida delivered a eulogy at Levinas&#x27; funeral, later published as &quot;Adieu √† Emmanuel L√©vinas&quot;, an appreciation and exploration of Levinas&#x27;s moral philosophy. Derrida used Bracha L. Ettinger&#x27;s interpretation of L√©vinas&#x27; notion of femininity and transformed his own earlier reading of this subject respectively. 

Derrida continued to produce readings of literature, writing extensively on Maurice Blanchot, Paul Celan, and others.

In 1991 he published &quot;The Other Heading&quot;, in which he discussed the concept of identity (as in cultural identity, European identity, and national identity), in the name of which in Europe have been unleashed &quot;the worst violences,&quot; &quot;the crimes of xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, religious or nationalist fanaticism.&quot;

At the 1997 Cerisy Conference, Derrida delivered a ten-hour address on the subject of &quot;the autobiographical animal&quot; entitled The Animal That Therefore I Am (More To Follow). Engaging with questions surrounding the ontology of nonhuman animals, the ethics of animal slaughter and the difference between humans and other animals, the address has been seen as initiating a late &quot;animal turn&quot; in Derrida&#x27;s philosophy, although Derrida himself has said that his interest in animals is present in his earliest writings.

===&quot;The Work of Mourning&quot; (1981‚Äì2001)===
Beginning with &quot;The Deaths of Roland Barthes&quot; in 1981, Derrida produced a series of texts on mourning and memory occasioned by the loss of his friends and colleagues, many of them new engagements with their work. &quot;Memoires for Paul de Man&quot;, a book-length lecture series presented first at Yale and then at Irvine as Derrida&#x27;s Wellek Lecture, followed in 1986, with a revision in 1989 that included &quot;Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man&#x27;s War&quot;. Ultimately, fourteen essays were collected into &quot;The Work of Mourning&quot; (2001), which was expanded in the 2003 French edition, &quot;Chaque fois unique, la fin du monde&quot; (literally, &quot;Unique each time, the end of the world&quot;), to include essays dedicated to G√©rard Granel and Maurice Blanchot.

===2002 film===
In October 2002, at the theatrical opening of the film &quot;Derrida&quot;, he said that, in many ways, he felt more and more close to Guy Debord&#x27;s work, and that this closeness appears in Derrida&#x27;s texts. Derrida mentioned, in particular, &quot;everything I say about the media, technology, the spectacle, and the &#x27;criticism of the show&#x27;, so to speak, and the markets ‚Äì the becoming-a-spectacle of everything, and the exploitation of the spectacle.&quot; Among the places in which Derrida mentions the &quot;Spectacle&quot;, is a 1997 interview about the notion of the intellectual.

==Politics==
Derrida engaged with a variety of political issues, movements, and debates throughout his career. In 1968, he participated in the May 68 protests in France [and met frequently with Maurice Blanchot]?. However, he expressed concerns about the &quot;cult of spontaneity&quot; and anti-unionist euphoria that he observed. He also registered his objections to the Vietnam War in a lecture he gave in the United States. Derrida signed a petition against age of consent laws in 1977, and in 1981 he founded the French Jan Hus association to support dissident Czech intellectuals.

In 1981, Derrida was arrested by the Czechoslovakian government for leading a conference without authorization and charged with drug trafficking, although he claimed the drugs were planted on him. He was released with the help of the Mitterrand government and Michel Foucault. Derrida was an advocate for nuclear disarmament, protested against apartheid in South Africa, and met with Palestinian intellectuals during a visit to Jerusalem in 1988. He also opposed capital punishment and was involved in the campaign to free Mumia Abu-Jamal.

Although Derrida was not associated with any political party until 1995, he supported the Socialist candidacy of Lionel Jospin, despite misgivings about such organizations. In the 2002 French presidential election, he refused to vote in the run-off election between far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen and center-right Jacques Chirac, citing a lack of acceptable choices. Derrida opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was engaged in rethinking politics and the political itself within and beyond philosophy. He focused on understanding the political implications of notions such as responsibility, reason of state, decision, sovereignty, and democracy. By 2000, he was theorizing &quot;democracy to come&quot; and thinking about the limitations of existing democracies.

==Influences on Derrida==
Crucial readings in his adolescence were Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Reveries of a Solitary Walker&quot; and &quot;Confessions&quot;, Andr√© Gide&#x27;s journal, &quot;La porte √©troite&quot;, &quot;Les nourritures terrestres&quot; and &quot;The Immoralist&quot;; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche. The phrase &quot;Families, I hate you!&quot; in particular, which inspired Derrida as an adolescent, is a famous verse from Gide&#x27;s &quot;Les nourritures terrestres&quot;, book IV. In a 1991 interview Derrida commented on a similar verse, also from book IV of the same Gide work: &quot;I hated the homes, the families, all the places where man thinks he&#x27;ll find rest&quot; (&quot;Je ha√Øssais les foyers, les familles, tous lieux o√π l&#x27;homme pense trouver un repos&quot;).

Other influences upon Derrida are Martin Heidegger, Plato, S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Alexandre Koj√®ve, Maurice Blanchot, Antonin Artaud, Roland Barthes, Georges Bataille, Edmund Husserl, Emmanuel L√©vinas, Ferdinand de Saussure, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Claude L√©vi-Strauss, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, J. L. Austin and St√©phane Mallarm√©.

His book, &quot;Adieu √† Emmanuel L√©vinas&quot;, reveals his mentorship by this philosopher and Talmudic scholar who practiced the phenomenological encounter with the Other in the form of the Face, which commanded human response. The use of deconstruction to read Jewish texts ‚Äì like the Talmud ‚Äì is relatively rare but has recently been attempted.

==Peers and contemporaries==

Derrida&#x27;s philosophical friends, allies, students and the heirs of Derrida&#x27;s thought include Paul de Man, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, Louis Althusser, Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Blanchot, Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Sarah Kofman, H√©l√®ne Cixous, Bernard Stiegler, Alexander Garc√≠a D√ºttmann, Joseph Cohen, Geoffrey Bennington, Jean-Luc Marion, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Raphael Zagury-Orly, Jacques Ehrmann, Avital Ronell, Judith Butler, B√©atrice Galinon-M√©l√©nec, Ernesto Laclau, Samuel Weber, Catherine Malabou, and Claudette Sartiliot.

=== Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe ===
Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe were among Derrida&#x27;s first students in France and went on to become well-known and important philosophers in their own right. Despite their considerable differences of subject, and often also of a method, they continued their close interaction with each other and with Derrida, from the early 1970s.

Derrida wrote on both of them, including a long book on Nancy: &quot;Le Toucher, Jean-Luc Nancy&quot; (&quot;On Touching‚ÄîJean-Luc Nancy&quot;, 2005).

===Paul de Man===
Derrida&#x27;s most prominent friendship in intellectual life was with Paul de Man, which began with their meeting at Johns Hopkins University and continued until de Man&#x27;s death in 1983. De Man provided a somewhat different approach to deconstruction, and his readings of literary and philosophical texts were crucial in the training of a generation of readers.

Shortly after de Man&#x27;s death, Derrida wrote the book &quot;Memoires: pour Paul de Man&quot; and in 1988 wrote an article in the journal &quot;Critical Inquiry&quot; called &quot;Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man&#x27;s War&quot;. The memoir became cause for controversy, because shortly before Derrida published his piece, it had been discovered by the Belgian literary critic Ortwin de Graef that long before his academic career in the US, de Man had written almost two hundred essays in a pro-Nazi newspaper during the German occupation of Belgium, including several that were explicitly antisemitic.

Critics of Derrida have argued that he minimizes the antisemitic character of de Man&#x27;s writing. Some critics have found Derrida&#x27;s treatment of this issue surprising, given that, for example, Derrida also spoke out against antisemitism and, in the 1960s, broke with the Heidegger disciple Jean Beaufret over Beaufret&#x27;s instances of antisemitism, about which Derrida (and, after him, Maurice Blanchot) expressed shock.

=== Michel Foucault ===
Derrida&#x27;s criticism of Foucault appears in the essay &quot;Cogito and the History of Madness&quot; (from &quot;Writing and Difference&quot;). It was first given as a lecture on 4 March 1963, at a conference at Wahl&#x27;s &quot;Coll√®ge philosophique&quot;, which Foucault attended, and caused a rift between the two men that was never fully mended.

In an appendix added to the 1972 edition of his &quot;History of Madness&quot;, Foucault disputed Derrida&#x27;s interpretation of his work, and accused Derrida of practicing &quot;a historically well-determined little pedagogy [...] which teaches the student that there is nothing outside the text [...]. A pedagogy which inversely gives to the voice of the masters that infinite sovereignty that allows it indefinitely to re-say the text.&quot; According to historian Carlo Ginzburg, Foucault may have written &quot;The Order of Things&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Archaeology of Knowledge&quot; partly under the stimulus of Derrida&#x27;s criticism. Carlo Ginzburg briefly labeled Derrida&#x27;s criticism in &quot;Cogito and the History of Madness&quot;, as &quot;facile, nihilistic objections,&quot; without giving further argumentation.

=== Derrida&#x27;s translators ===
Geoffrey Bennington, Avital Ronell and Samuel Weber belong to a group of Derrida translators. Many of Derrida&#x27;s translators are esteemed thinkers in their own right. Derrida often worked in a collaborative arrangement, allowing his prolific output to be translated into English in a timely fashion.

Having started as a student of de Man, Gayatri Spivak took on the translation of &quot;Of Grammatology&quot; early in her career and has since revised it into a second edition. Barbara Johnson&#x27;s translation of Derrida&#x27;s &quot;Dissemination&quot; was published by The Athlone Press in 1981. Alan Bass was responsible for several early translations; Bennington and Peggy Kamuf have continued to produce translations of his work for nearly twenty years. In recent years, a number of translations have appeared by Michael Naas (also a Derrida scholar) and Pascale-Anne Brault.

Bennington, Brault, Kamuf, Naas, Elizabeth Rottenberg, and David Wills are currently engaged in translating Derrida&#x27;s previously unpublished seminars, which span from 1959 to 2003. Volumes I and II of &quot;The Beast and the Sovereign&quot; (presenting Derrida&#x27;s seminars from 12 December 2001 to 27 March 2002 and from 11 December 2002 to 26 March 2003), as well as &quot;The Death Penalty, Volume I&quot; (covering 8 December 1999 to 22 March 2000), have appeared in English translation. Further volumes currently projected for the series include &quot;Heidegger: The Question of Being and History&quot; (1964‚Äì1965), &quot;Death Penalty, Volume II&quot; (2000‚Äì2001), &quot;Perjury and Pardon, Volume I&quot; (1997‚Äì1998), and &quot;Perjury and Pardon, Volume II&quot; (1998‚Äì1999).

With Bennington, Derrida undertook the challenge published as &quot;Jacques Derrida&quot;, an arrangement in which Bennington attempted to provide a systematic explication of Derrida&#x27;s work (called the &quot;Derridabase&quot;) using the top two-thirds of every page, while Derrida was given the finished copy of every Bennington chapter and the bottom third of every page in which to show how deconstruction exceeded Bennington&#x27;s account (this was called the &quot;Circumfession&quot;). Derrida seems to have viewed Bennington in particular as a kind of rabbinical explicator, noting at the end of the &quot;Applied Derrida&quot; conference, held at the University of Luton in 1995 that: &quot;everything has been said and, as usual, Geoff Bennington has said everything before I have even opened my mouth. I have the challenge of trying to be unpredictable after him, which is impossible... so I&#x27;ll try to pretend to be unpredictable after Geoff. Once again.&quot;

=== Marshall McLuhan ===
Derrida was familiar with the work of Marshall McLuhan, and since his early 1967 writings (&quot;Of Grammatology&quot;, &quot;Speech and Phenomena&quot;), he speaks of language as a &quot;medium,&quot; of phonetic writing as &quot;the medium of the great metaphysical, scientific, technical, and economic adventure of the West.&quot;

He expressed his disagreement with McLuhan in regard to what Derrida called McLuhan&#x27;s ideology about the end of writing. In a 1982 interview, he said:

And in his 1972 essay &quot;Signature Event Context&quot; he said:

=== Architectural thinkers ===
Derrida had a direct impact on the theories and practices of influential architects Peter Eisenman and Bernard Tschumi towards the end of the twentieth century. Derrida impacted a project that was theorized by Eisenman in &quot;Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman&quot;. This design was architecturally conceived by Tschumi for the Parc de la Villette in Paris, which included a sieve, or harp-like structure that Derrida envisaged as a physical metaphor for the receptacle-like properties of the &quot;kh√¥ra&quot;. Moreover, Derrida&#x27;s commentaries on Plato&#x27;s notion of &quot;kh√¥ra&quot; (œáœéœÅŒ±) as set in the &quot;Timaeus&quot; (48e4) received later reflections in the philosophical works and architectural writings of the philosopher-architect Nader El-Bizri within the domain of phenomenology.

Derrida used &quot;œáœéœÅŒ±&quot; to name a radical otherness that &quot;gives place&quot; for being. El-Bizri built on this by more narrowly taking &quot;kh√¥ra&quot; to name the radical happening of an ontological difference between being and beings. El-Bizri&#x27;s reflections on &quot;kh√¥ra&quot; are taken as a basis for tackling the meditations on &quot;dwelling&quot; and on &quot;being and space&quot; in Heidegger&#x27;s thought and the critical conceptions of space and place as they evolved in architectural theory (and its strands in phenomenological thinking), and in history of philosophy and science, with a focus on geometry and optics. This also describes El-Bizri&#x27;s take on &quot;econtology&quot; as an extension of Heidegger&#x27;s consideration of the question of being (&quot;Seinsfrage&quot;) by way of the fourfold (&quot;Das Geviert&quot;) of earth-sky-mortals-divinities (&quot;Erde und Himmel, Sterblichen und G√∂ttlichen&quot;); and as also impacted by his own meditations on Derrida&#x27;s take on &quot;œáœéœÅŒ±&quot;. Ecology is hence co-entangled with ontology, whereby the worldly existential analytics are grounded in earthiness, and environmentalism is orientated by ontological thinking
Derrida argued that the subjectile is like Plato&#x27;s &quot;kh√¥ra&quot;, Greek for space, receptacle or site. Plato proposes that &quot;kh√¥ra&quot; rests between the sensible and the intelligible, through which everything passes but in which nothing is retained. For example, an image needs to be held by something, just as a mirror will hold a reflection. For Derrida, &quot;kh√¥ra&quot; defies attempts at naming or the either/or logic, which he &quot;deconstructed&quot;.

== Criticism ==

=== Criticism from Marxists ===
In a paper entitled &quot;Ghostwriting&quot;, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak‚Äîthe translator of Derrida&#x27;s &quot;De la grammatologie&quot; (&quot;Of Grammatology&quot;) into English‚Äîcriticised Derrida&#x27;s understanding of Marx. Commenting on Derrida&#x27;s &quot;Specters of Marx&quot;, Terry Eagleton wrote &quot;The portentousness is ingrained in the very letter of this book, as one theatrically inflected rhetorical question tumbles hard on the heels of another in a tiresomely mannered syntax which lays itself wide open to parody.&quot;

=== Criticism from Anglophone philosophers ===
Though Derrida addressed the American Philosophical Association on at least one occasion in 1988, and was highly regarded by some contemporary philosophers like Richard Rorty, Alexander Nehamas, and Stanley Cavell, his work has been regarded by other analytic philosophers, such as John Searle and Willard Van Orman Quine, as pseudophilosophy or sophistry.

Some analytic philosophers have in fact claimed, since at least the 1980s, that Derrida&#x27;s work is &quot;not philosophy&quot;. One of the main arguments they gave was alleging that Derrida&#x27;s influence had not been on US philosophy departments but on literature and other humanities disciplines.

In his 1989 &quot;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity&quot;, Richard Rorty argues that Derrida (especially in his book, &quot;The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond&quot;, one section of which is an experiment in fiction) purposefully uses words that cannot be defined (e.g., &quot;diff√©rance&quot;), and uses previously definable words in contexts diverse enough to make understanding impossible, so that the reader will never be able to contextualize Derrida&#x27;s literary self. Rorty, however, argues that this intentional obfuscation is philosophically grounded. In garbling his message Derrida is attempting to escape the na√Øve, positive metaphysical projects of his predecessors.

Roger Scruton wrote in 2004, &quot;He&#x27;s difficult to summarise because it&#x27;s nonsense. He argues that the meaning of a sign is never revealed in the sign but deferred indefinitely and that a sign only means something by virtue of its difference from something else. For Derrida, there is no such thing as meaning ‚Äì it always eludes us and therefore anything goes.&quot;

On Derrida&#x27;s scholarship and writing style, Noam Chomsky wrote &quot;I found the scholarship appalling, based on pathetic misreading; and the argument, such as it was, failed to come close to the kinds of standards I&#x27;ve been familiar with since virtually childhood. Well, maybe I missed something: could be, but suspicions remain, as noted.&quot;

Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt also criticized his work for misusing scientific terms and concepts in &quot;Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science&quot; (1994).

Three quarrels (or disputes) in particular went out of academic circles and received international mass media coverage: the 1972‚Äì88 quarrel with John Searle, the analytic philosophers&#x27; pressures on Cambridge University not to award Derrida an honorary degree, and a dispute with Richard Wolin and the NYRB.

==== Searle‚ÄìDerrida debate ====
==== Cambridge honorary doctorate ====
In 1992 some academics at Cambridge University, mostly not from the philosophy faculty, proposed that Derrida be awarded an honorary doctorate. This was opposed by, among others, the university&#x27;s Professor of Philosophy Hugh Mellor. Eighteen other philosophers from US, Austrian, Australian, French, Polish, Italian, German, Dutch, Swiss, Spanish, and British institutions, including Barry Smith, Willard Van Orman Quine, David Armstrong, Ruth Barcan Marcus, and Ren√© Thom, then sent a letter to Cambridge claiming that Derrida&#x27;s work &quot;does not meet accepted standards of clarity and rigour&quot; and describing Derrida&#x27;s philosophy as being composed of &quot;tricks and gimmicks similar to those of the Dadaists&quot;. The letter concluded that:

In the end the protesters were outnumbered‚Äî336 votes to 204‚Äîwhen Cambridge put the motion to a formal ballot; though almost all of those who proposed Derrida and who voted in favour were not from the philosophy faculty. Hugh Mellor continued to find the award undeserved, explaining: &quot;He is a mediocre, unoriginal philosopher ‚Äî he is not even interestingly bad&quot;.

Derrida suggested in an interview that part of the reason for the attacks on his work was that it questioned and modified &quot;the rules of the dominant discourse, it tries to politicize and democratize education and the university scene&quot;. To answer a question about the &quot;exceptional violence&quot;, the compulsive &quot;ferocity&quot;, and the &quot;exaggeration&quot; of the &quot;attacks&quot;, he would say that these critics organize and practice in his case &quot;a sort of obsessive personality cult that philosophers should know how to question and above all to moderate&quot;.

====Dispute with Richard Wolin and the &quot;NYRB&quot;====
Richard Wolin has argued since 1991 that Derrida&#x27;s work, as well as that of Derrida&#x27;s major inspirations (e.g., Bataille, Blanchot, Levinas, Heidegger, Nietzsche), leads to a corrosive nihilism. For example, Wolin argues that the &quot;deconstructive gesture of overturning and reinscription ends up by threatening to efface many of the essential differences between Nazism and non-Nazism&quot;.

In 1991, when Wolin published a Derrida interview on Heidegger in the first edition of &quot;The Heidegger Controversy&quot;, Derrida argued that the interview was an intentionally malicious mistranslation, which was &quot;demonstrably execrable&quot; and &quot;weak, simplistic, and compulsively aggressive&quot;. As French law requires the consent of an author to translations and this consent was not given, Derrida insisted that the interview not appear in any subsequent editions or reprints. Columbia University Press subsequently refused to offer reprints or new editions. Later editions of &quot;The Heidegger Controversy&quot; by MIT Press also omitted the Derrida interview. The matter achieved public exposure owing to a friendly review of Wolin&#x27;s book by the Heideggerian scholar Thomas Sheehan that appeared in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, in which Sheehan characterised Derrida&#x27;s protests as an imposition of censorship. It was followed by an exchange of letters. Derrida in turn responded to Sheehan and Wolin, in &quot;The Work of Intellectuals and the Press (The Bad Example: How the New York Review of Books and Company do Business)&quot;, which was published in the book &quot;Points...&quot;.

Twenty-four academics, belonging to different schools and groups ‚Äì often in disagreement with each other and with deconstruction ‚Äì signed a letter addressed to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, in which they expressed their indignation for the magazine&#x27;s behaviour as well as that of Sheenan and Wolin.

=== Critical obituaries ===
Critical obituaries of Derrida were published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot;. The magazine &quot;The Nation&quot; responded to the &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary saying that &quot;even though American papers had scorned and trivialized Derrida before, the tone seemed particularly caustic&quot;. A second obituary by deconstruction scholar and Derrida&#x27;s friend Mark C. Taylor was published by the &quot;Times&quot; a few days after the first one.

<doc id="53256" wikidata="Q4686902" url="?curid=53256" title="Advogato">
<text>Advogato was an online community and social networking site dedicated to free software development and created by Raph Levien. In 2007, Steve Rainwater took over maintenance and new development from Raph. In 2016, Rainwater&#x27;s running instance was shut down and backed up to archive.org.

== History ==
Advogato described itself as &quot;the free software developer&#x27;s advocate.&quot; Advogato was an early pioneer of blogs, formerly known as &quot;online diaries&quot;, and one of the earliest social networking websites. Advogato combined the most recent entries from each user&#x27;s diary together into a single continuous feed called the &quot;recentlog&quot;, directly inspiring the creation of the Planet aggregator somewhat later.

Several high-profile members of the free software and open source software movements were users of the site, including Richard M. Stallman, Eric Raymond, Alan Cox, Bruce Perens, and Jamie Zawinski.

Because Advogato was the first website to use a robust, attack-resistant trust metric and to release the underlying code for that trust mechanism under a free software license, it has been the basis of numerous research papers on trust metrics and social networking (see the list below for specific examples). Advogato&#x27;s early adoption of an XML-RPC interface led to its use as an example of how such interfaces could be used by web programmers.

Advogato saw use as a testbed for social networking and semantic web technologies. Tim Berners-Lee, who was an Advogato user himself, included Advogato in a short list of sites notable for their early adoption of the FOAF as a method of exporting user RDF URIs.

== Trust metric ==
The motivating idea for Advogato was to try out in practice Levien&#x27;s ideas about attack-resistant trust metrics, having users certify each other in a kind of peer review process and use this information to avoid the abuses that plague open community sites. Levien observed that his notion of attack-resistant trust metric was fundamentally very similar to the PageRank algorithm used by Google to rate article interest. In the case of Advogato, the trust metric was designed to include all individuals who could reasonably be considered members of the Free Software and Open Source communities while excluding others.

The implementation of this trust metric was through an Apache module called &quot;mod_virgule&quot;. &quot;mod_virgule&quot; is free software, licensed under the GPL and written in C.

Despite the trust metric, posting privileges to the front page of Advogato were gained by controversial individuals, leading some to claim Advogato&#x27;s trust metric solution was faulty.
Misunderstanding of the purpose of Advogato&#x27;s trust metric was common, which often led to the assumption that it should exclude specific individuals on the basis that they were known cranks.

<text>Dame Olivia Newton-John (26 September 1948 ‚Äì 8 August 2022) was a British and Australian singer and actress. With over 100 million records sold, Newton-John was one of the best-selling music artists of all time, as well as the highest-selling female Australian recording artist of all-time.

In 1978, Newton-John starred in the musical film &quot;Grease&quot;, which was the highest-grossing musical film at the time and whose remains one of the world&#x27;s best-selling albums. It features two major hit duets with co-star John Travolta: &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot;‚Äîwhich is one of the best-selling singles of all time‚Äîand &quot;Summer Nights&quot;. Her signature solo recordings include the Record of the Year Grammy winner &quot;I Honestly Love You&quot; (1974) and &quot;Physical&quot; (1981)‚Äî&quot;Billboard&quot;‚Ä≥s highest-ranking Hot 100 single of the 1980s. Other defining hit singles include &quot;If Not for You&quot; and &quot;Banks of the Ohio&quot; (both 1971), &quot;Let Me Be There&quot; (1973), &quot;If You Love Me (Let Me Know)&quot; (1974), &quot;Have You Never Been Mellow&quot; (1975), &quot;Sam&quot; (1977), &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; (1978; also from &quot;Grease&quot;), &quot;A Little More Love&quot; (1978), &quot;Twist of Fate&quot; (1983) and, from the 1980 film &quot;Xanadu&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot; and &quot;Xanadu&quot; (with the Electric Light Orchestra).

Newton-John&#x27;s accolades include four Grammy Awards, a Daytime Emmy Award, nine &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, six American Music Awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She scored fifteen top-ten singles, including five number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and two number-one albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200: &quot;If You Love Me, Let Me Know&quot; (1974) and &quot;Have You Never Been Mellow&quot; (1975). Eleven of her singles (including two Platinum) and fourteen of her albums (including two Platinum and four 2√ó Platinum) have been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). She was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia in 2006 and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2020.

Newton-John, who had breast cancer three times, was an advocate and sponsor for breast cancer research. In 2012, the Olivia Newton-John Cancer &amp; Wellness Centre at the Austin Hospital opened in her home town of Melbourne; in 2015, the facility was rechristened the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness &amp; Research Centre. She was also an activist for environmental and animal rights causes.

==Early life and family==
Olivia Newton-John was born on 26 September 1948 in Cambridge to Brinley &quot;Bryn&quot; Newton-John (1914‚Äì1992) and Irene Helene (n√©e Born; 1914‚Äì2003). Her father was born and raised in Wales to a middle-class family. Her mother was born and raised in Germany to a German Jewish academic family who came to the UK in 1933 to escape the Nazi regime.

Newton-John&#x27;s maternal grandfather was German Jewish Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning physicist Max Born. Her maternal grandmother Hedwig was the daughter of German Jewish jurist Victor Ehrenberg and his Lutheran wife, Helene Agatha von Jhering. Through Helene Agatha, Newton-John was a descendant of Protestant theologian Martin Luther. She was also descended from an unspecified Spanish monarch. Helene Agatha&#x27;s own father, Newton-John&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, was jurist Rudolf von Jhering. Newton-John&#x27;s uncle was pharmacologist Gustav Victor Rudolf Born. Through her Ehrenberg line, Newton-John was a third cousin of comedian Ben Elton.

Newton-John&#x27;s father was an MI5 officer on the Enigma project at Bletchley Park who took Rudolf Hess into custody during World War II. After the war, he became the headmaster of the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys and was in this post when Newton-John was born.

Newton-John was the youngest of three children, following her brother Hugh (1939‚Äì2019), a medical doctor, and her sister Rona (1941‚Äì2013), an actress who was married to restaurateur Brian Goldsmith and was later married to Newton-John&#x27;s &quot;Grease&quot; co-star Jeff Conaway (from 1980 until their divorce in 1985). She also had a half-brother, Toby, and a half-sister, Sarah, both of whom were born of her father&#x27;s second marriage.

In early 1954, when Newton-John was five, her family emigrated to Melbourne, Victoria, on the SS &quot;Strathaird&quot;. Her father worked as a professor of German and as the master of Ormond College at the University of Melbourne. Her family attended church while her father served as the head of the Presbyterian college.

Newton-John attended Christ Church Grammar School in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra and then the University High School in Parkville.

==Career==
===Career beginnings===
Newton-John went to primary school with Daryl Braithwaite, who also followed a singing career. At age 14, with three classmates, Newton-John formed a short-lived, all-girl group called Sol Four which often performed at a coffee shop owned by her brother-in-law.

Newton-John originally wanted to become a veterinarian but then chose to focus on performance after doubting her ability to pass science exams.

In 1964, Newton-John&#x27;s acting talent was first recognised portraying Lady Mary Lasenby in her University High School&#x27;s production of &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; as she became the Young Sun&#x27;s Drama Award best schoolgirl actress runner-up. She then became a regular on local Australian television shows, including &quot;Time for Terry&quot; and HSV-7&#x27;s &quot;The Happy Show&quot;, where she performed as &quot;Lovely Livvy&quot;. She also appeared on &quot;The Go!! Show,&quot; where she met her future duet partner, singer Pat Carroll, and her future music producer, John Farrar. (Carroll and Farrar later married.)

In 1965, she entered and won a talent contest on the television program &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing,&quot; hosted by 1960s Australian icon Johnny O&#x27;Keefe. She performed the songs &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot; and &quot;Everything&#x27;s Coming Up Roses&quot;. She was initially reluctant to use her prize, a trip to Great Britain, but travelled there nearly a year later after her mother encouraged her to broaden her horizons.

While in Britain, Newton-John missed her then-boyfriend, Ian Turpie, with whom she had co-starred in the 1965 Australian telefilm &quot;Funny Things Happen Down Under&quot;. She repeatedly booked trips back to Australia that her mother cancelled.

In 1966, Newton-John recorded her first single, &quot;Till You Say You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot;, in Britain for Decca Records.

Newton-John&#x27;s outlook changed when Pat Carroll moved to the UK. The two formed a duo called Pat and Olivia and toured nightclubs in Europe. (In one incident, they were booked at Paul Raymond&#x27;s Revue in Soho, London, and were unaware that it was a strip club until they began to perform onstage dressed primly in frilly high-collared dresses.) During this period, she and Carroll contributed backup vocals to recordings by a number of other artists, notably the song &quot;Come In, You&#x27;ll Get Pneumonia&quot; by the Easybeats. After Carroll&#x27;s visa expired, Carroll was forced to return to Australia but Newton-John remained in Britain to pursue solo work.

Newton-John was recruited for the group Toomorrow, formed by American producer Don Kirshner. In 1970, the group starred in the science fiction musical &quot;Toomorrow&quot; and recorded an accompanying soundtrack album on RCA Records; both the LP and the movie were named after the group. That same year, the group made two single recordings: &quot;You&#x27;re My Baby Now&quot;/&quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot; and &quot;I Could Never Live Without Your Love&quot;/&quot;Roll Like a River&quot;. Neither track became a chart success; the project failed and the group disbanded.

===1971‚Äì1974: Early success===

In 1971, Newton-John released her first solo album, &quot;If Not for You&quot; (US No. 158 Pop). In the UK, the album was released as &quot;Olivia Newton-John&quot;. The title track, written by Bob Dylan, was her first international hit (US No. 25 Pop, No. 1 Adult Contemporary/&quot;AC&quot;). Her follow-up single, &quot;Banks of the Ohio&quot;, was a top 10 hit in the UK and Australia, but only peaked at number 94 in the United States. She was voted Best British Female Vocalist two years in a row by the magazine &quot;Record Mirror&quot;. She made frequent appearances on Cliff Richard&#x27;s weekly show &quot;It&#x27;s Cliff Richard&quot; and starred with him in the telefilm &quot;The Case&quot;.

Newton-John&#x27;s 1972 single &quot;What Is Life&quot; (No. 34 AC) made minimal impact in the United States. As a result, her second studio album &quot;Olivia&quot; was never formally issued in the United States. The subsequent single &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; similarly saw little success. Her fortune changed with the release of &quot;Let Me Be There&quot; in 1973. The song reached the American top 10 on the Pop (No. 6), Country (No. 7), and AC (No. 3) charts and earned her a Grammy for Best Country Female and an Academy of Country Music award for Most Promising Female Vocalist.

Her third studio album &quot;Let Me Be There&quot; was released in November 1973, retitled &quot;Music Makes My Day&quot; in Britain. The US and Canadian versions featured an alternate track list that mixed new cuts with selections from &quot;Olivia&quot; and also recycled six songs from &quot;If Not for You&quot;, which was going out of print.
In 1974, Newton-John represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Long Live Love&quot;. The song was chosen for Newton-John by the British public out of six possible entries (Newton-John later admitted that she disliked the song). Newton-John finished fourth at the contest, held in Brighton, behind the Swedish winning entry, &quot;Waterloo&quot; by ABBA. All six Eurovision contest song candidates‚Äî&quot;Have Love, Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Lovin&#x27; You Ain&#x27;t Easy&quot;, &quot;Long Live Love&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; and &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot;‚Äîwere recorded by Newton-John and included on her &quot;Long Live Love&quot; album, her first for the EMI Records label.

The &quot;Long Live Love&quot; album was released in the US and Canada as &quot;If You Love Me, Let Me Know&quot;. All the Eurovision entries were dropped for different and more country-flavoured tunes intended to capitalise on the success of &quot;Let Me Be There&quot;; the North American offering used selections from &quot;Long Live Love&quot;, &quot;Olivia&quot; and &quot;Music Makes My Day&quot;, and only the title cut was new. The album reached No. 1 on both the pop (one week) and country (eight weeks) albums charts. &quot;If You Love Me, Let Me Know&quot; title track was its first single and reached No. 5 Pop, No. 2 Country (her highest-peaking song on the chart) and No. 2 AC. The next single, &quot;I Honestly Love You&quot;, became Newton-John&#x27;s signature song. Written and composed by Jeff Barry and Peter Allen, the ballad became her first Pop number-one (staying there for two weeks), second AC number-one (for three weeks) and third top 10 Country (No. 6) hit and earned Newton-John two more Grammys for Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance ‚Äì Female. In her 2018 autobiography, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;,&quot; Newton-John describes &quot;I Honestly Love You&quot; as a song which is &quot;so simple, with a meaning that was deeper than the ocean&quot;. In 1974, she received the (BCMA) British Country Music Association Award for &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot; in London, England.

In the United States, Newton-John&#x27;s success in country music sparked a debate among purists, who took issue with a foreigner singing country-flavoured pop music being classed with native Nashville artists. In addition to her Grammy for &quot;Let Me Be There&quot;, in 1974 Newton-John was also named the Country Music Association Female Vocalist of the Year, a designation which made her the first British singer to have won the award; and the title also meant she defeated more established Nashville-based nominees Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tanya Tucker, as well as Canadian artist Anne Murray.

This protest by country music participants led to the formation of the short-lived Association of Country Entertainers (ACE). Newton-John was eventually supported by the country music community. Stella Parton, Dolly&#x27;s sister, recorded &quot;Ode to Olivia&quot; and Newton-John recorded her 1976 album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot;, in Nashville, Tennessee.

=== 1975‚Äì1977: &quot;Have You Never Been Mellow&quot;, &quot;Clearly Love&quot;, and continued success ===
Encouraged by expatriate Australian singer Helen Reddy, Newton-John left the UK and moved to the US. Newton-John topped the Pop (one week) and Country (six weeks) albums charts with her next album, &quot;Have You Never Been Mellow&quot;. For 45 years, Olivia held the Guinness World Record for the shortest gap (154 days) by a female between new Number 1 albums (&quot;If You Love Me, Let Me Know &gt; Have You Never Been Mellow&quot;) on the US Billboard 200 album charts until Taylor Swift in 2020 (140 days with &quot;folklore &gt; evermore&quot;).

The &quot;Have You Never Been Mellow&quot; album generated two singles ‚Äì the John Farrar-penned title track (No. 1 Pop, No. 3 Country, No. 1 AC) and &quot;Please Mr. Please&quot; (No. 3 Pop, No. 5 Country, No. 1 AC).

Her pop career cooled with the release of her next album, &quot;Clearly Love&quot;. Her streak of five consecutive gold top 10 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 ended when the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Something Better to Do&quot;, stopped at No. 13 (also No. 19 Country and No. 1 AC). Her albums still achieved gold status, and she returned to the top ten of the Hot 100 and &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts again in 1978.

Newton-John&#x27;s singles continued to top the AC chart, where she amassed ten No. 1 singles, including a record seven consecutively:
* &quot;I Honestly Love You&quot; (1974) ‚Äì 3 weeks
* &quot;Have You Never Been Mellow&quot; (1975) ‚Äì 1 week
* &quot;Please Mr. Please&quot; (1975) ‚Äì 3 weeks
* &quot;Something Better to Do&quot; (1975) ‚Äì 3 weeks
* &quot;Let It Shine&quot;/&quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot; (1976) ‚Äì 2 weeks
* &quot;Come on Over&quot; (1976) ‚Äì 1 week
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; (1976) ‚Äì 1 week

She provided a prominent, but uncredited, vocal on John Denver&#x27;s &quot;Fly Away&quot; single, which was succeeded by her own single, &quot;Let It Shine&quot;/&quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot;, at No. 1 on the AC chart. (&quot;Fly Away&quot; returned to No. 1 after the two-week reign of &quot;Let It Shine&quot;.) In December, 1975, she appeared on the ABC special &quot;John Denver - A Rocky Mountain Christmas&quot;, where she performed the duet of ‚ÄúFly Away‚Äù with John, as well as ‚ÄúLet It Shine&quot;. Newton-John also continued to reach the Country top 10 where she tallied seven top 10 singles through 1976&#x27;s &quot;Come on Over&quot; (No. 23 Pop, No. 5 Country, No. 1 AC) (from the same-titled album) and six consecutive (of a career nine total) top 10 albums through 1976&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; (No. 30 Pop, No. 7 Country). She headlined her first US television special, &quot;A Special Olivia Newton-John&quot;, in November 1976.

In 1977, the single &quot;Sam&quot;, a mid-tempo waltz from &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&quot;, returned her to the No. 1 spot on the AC (No. 40 Country) and also reached No. 20 Pop, her highest chart placement since &quot;Something Better to Do&quot;. By mid-1977, Newton-John&#x27;s pop, AC, and country success all suffered a slight blow. Her &quot;Making a Good Thing Better&quot; album (No. 34 Pop, No. 13 Country) was not certified gold, and its only single, the title track (No. 87 Pop, No. 20 AC), did not reach the AC top 10 or the Country chart. Later that year, &quot;Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; (No. 13 Pop, No. 7 Country) became her first platinum album.

Newton-John was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1979 New Year Honours and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to charity, cancer research, and entertainment.

===1978‚Äì1979: &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;Totally Hot&quot;===

In 1978, Newton-John&#x27;s career soared after she starred as Sandy in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical &quot;Grease.&quot; She was offered the role after meeting producer Allan Carr at a dinner party at Helen Reddy&#x27;s home. Disillusioned by her &quot;Toomorrow&quot; experience and concerned that she was too old to play a high school senior (she was 28 during the filming of &quot;Grease&quot;), Newton-John insisted on a screen test with the film&#x27;s co-lead, John Travolta. Newton-John previewed some of the film&#x27;s soundtrack during her second American network television special, &quot;Olivia&quot;, featuring guests ABBA and Andy Gibb.

&quot;Grease&quot; became the biggest box-office hit of 1978. spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 and yielded three Top 5 singles for Newton-John: the platinum &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot; (No. 1 Pop, No. 23 AC) with John Travolta, the gold &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; (No. 3 Pop, No. 20 Country, No. 7 AC) and the gold &quot;Summer Nights&quot; (No. 5 Pop, No. 21 AC) with John Travolta and the film&#x27;s cast. Newton-John became the second woman (after Linda Ronstadt in 1977) to have two singles‚Äî&quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; and &quot;Summer Nights&quot;‚Äîin the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 5 simultaneously. The soundtrack is one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time. In June 2006, Newton-John&#x27;s company ON-J Productions Ltd filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) for $1¬†million in unpaid royalties from the &quot;Grease&quot; soundtrack. In 2007, it was announced that she and UMG had reached a &quot;conditional settlement&quot;.

Newton-John&#x27;s performance earned her a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favourite Film Actress. She was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Musical and performed the Oscar-nominated &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; at the 1979 Academy Awards. The film&#x27;s popularity has endured. It was re-released for its 20th anniversary in 1998 and ranked as the second highest-grossing film behind &quot;Titanic&quot; in its opening weekend. Following her death in August 2022, AMC announced that the picture would reappear in some of its cinemas over the weekend and that a portion of the proceeds would go to breast cancer research.

In November 1978, she released her next studio album, &quot;Totally Hot&quot;, which became her first solo top 10 (No. 7) album since &quot;Have You Never Been Mellow&quot;. Dressed on the cover all in leather, Newton-John capitalised on her character&#x27;s look that was introduced at the end of &quot;Grease;&quot; moreover, &quot;Totally Hot&quot;&#x27;s singles‚Äî&quot;A Little More Love&quot; (No. 3 Pop, No. 94 Country, No. 4 AC), &quot;Deeper Than the Night&quot; (No. 11 Pop, No. 87 Country, No. 4 AC), and the title track (No. 52 Pop)‚Äîall demonstrated a more aggressive and uptempo sound for Newton-John. Although the album de-emphasised the country sound, the LP still reached No. 4 on the Country Albums chart. Newton-John released the B-side, &quot;Dancin&#x27; &#x27;Round and &#x27;Round&quot;, of the &quot;Totally Hot&quot; single to Country radio. The entry peaked at No. 29 (as well as No. 82 Pop and No. 25 AC), and it became her last charted solo Country airplay single.

Newton-John cancelled a 1978 concert tour of Japan to protest the slaughter of dolphins caught in tuna fishing nets. She subsequently rescheduled the tour when the Japanese government assured her that the practice was being curbed. In honor of dolphins, in 1981 she also composed and recorded the song &quot;The Promise (the Dolphin Song)&quot; on the &quot;Physical&quot; album.

She was a performer on the 1979 &quot;Music for UNICEF Concert&quot; for the UN&#x27;s International Year of the Child televised worldwide. During the concert, artists performed songs for which they donated their royalties, some in perpetuity, to benefit the cause.

====Lawsuit against MCA Records====
In April 1975, Newton-John and MCA entered into an initial two-year, four-album deal in which she was expected to deliver two LPs a year for the record company. MCA also had the option of extending the contract for six more records and three more years; and if the artist did not deliver on time, MCA was allegedly allowed to lengthen the term of the contract.

Per her new agreement with MCA, Newton-John&#x27;s first three albums, beginning with &quot;Clearly Love&quot;, came out on schedule. Her fourth, &quot;Making a Good Thing Better&quot;, was late. This delay occurred around the same time she was working on &quot;Grease&quot; for RSO Records, and the postponement arguably gave MCA‚Äîwhich seemed to want to keep its hold on the performer‚Äîthe right to exercise its option, extend its contract, and stop her from signing with another enterprise. She also did not deliver a &quot;newly optioned&quot; album.

On 31 May 1978, Newton-John and MCA each filed breach-of-contract actions against the other. Newton-John sued for $10 million and claimed that MCA&#x27;s failure to adequately promote and advertise her product freed her from their agreement. MCA&#x27;s countersuit requested $1 million in damages and an injunction against Newton-John working with another music firm.

Ultimately, Newton-John was forbidden from offering her recording services to another label until the five-year pact had run its course. The original covenant was not automatically extended, though she had not duly supplied the total sum of vinyls indicated in the contract.

As a result of the lawsuit, record companies changed their contracts to be based on the number of albums recorded by a musician and not a specific number of years.

=== 1980‚Äì1988: &quot;Physical&quot;, &quot;Soul Kiss&quot;, and &quot;The Rumour&quot; ===

Newton-John began 1980 by releasing &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (No. 12 Pop, No. 8 AC), a duet with Andy Gibb from his &quot;After Dark&quot; album, and by starring in her third television special, &quot;Hollywood Nights&quot;. Later that year, she appeared in her first film since &quot;Grease&quot; when she starred with Gene Kelly and Michael Beck in the musical fantasy &quot;Xanadu&quot;. Although the film was a critical failure, its soundtrack (No. 4 Pop) was certified double platinum and scored five top 20 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Newton-John charted with &quot;Magic&quot; (No. 1 Pop, No. 1 AC), &quot;Suddenly&quot; with Cliff Richard (No. 20 Pop, No. 4 AC) and the title song &quot;Xanadu&quot; with the Electric Light Orchestra (No. 8 Pop, No. 2 AC). [ELO also charted with &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; (No. 16 Pop, No. 48 AC) and &quot;All Over the World&quot; (No. 13 Pop, No. 46 AC).]

&quot;Magic&quot; was Newton-John&#x27;s biggest pop hit to that point (four weeks at No. 1) and still ranks as the biggest AC hit of her career (five weeks at No. 1). The film &quot;Xanadu&quot; has since become a cult classic and the basis for a Broadway show that ran for more than 500 performances beginning in 2007 and was nominated for four Tony Awards including Best Musical.

In 1981, Newton-John released her most successful studio album, the double platinum &quot;Physical&quot;, which strongly reinforced her image change by showcasing risqu√©, rock-oriented material. Newton-John explained: &quot;I just wasn&#x27;t in the mood for tender ballads. I wanted peppy stuff because that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m feeling.&quot; Of the title cut, Newton-John said: &quot;Roger Davies was my manager at the time; he played it for me and I knew it was a very catchy song.&quot; The title track, written by Steve Kipner and Terry Shaddick, spent ten weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This matched the record at that time held by Debby Boone&#x27;s &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; for most weeks spent at No. 1 on the Hot 100. The single was certified platinum, and it ultimately ranked as the biggest song of the decade. (In 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song No. 6 among all songs that charted in the 50-year history of the Hot 100.)

&quot;Physical&quot; earned Newton-John her only placement ever on the R&amp;B Singles (No. 28) and Albums (No. 32) charts. The &quot;Physical&quot; album spawned two more singles, &quot;Make a Move on Me&quot; (No. 5 Pop, No. 6 AC) and &quot;Landslide&quot; (No. 52 Pop).

The provocative lyrics of the &quot;Physical&quot; title track prompted two Utah radio stations to ban the single from their playlists. (In 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked this as the most popular single ever about sex.) To counter its overtly suggestive tone, Newton-John filmed an exercise-themed video that turned the song into an aerobics anthem and made headbands a fashion accessory outside the gym.

She helped pioneer the music video industry by recording a video album for &quot;Physical&quot;, featuring videos of all the album&#x27;s tracks and three of her older hits. The video album earned her a fourth Grammy and was aired as an ABC prime-time special, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Physical&quot;, becoming a top-10 Nielsen hit. Newton-John asserted: &quot;Like everyone, I&#x27;ve got different sides of my personality. I&#x27;ve my dominant self, my need-to-be-dominated self, the sane Olivia and the crazy Olivia. Playing these different characters gave me a chance to show strange parts people haven&#x27;t seen much.&quot;

The success of &quot;Physical&quot; led to an international tour and the release of her second hits collection, the double-platinum &quot;Olivia&#x27;s Greatest Hits Vol. 2&quot; (No. 16 Pop), which yielded two more top-40 singles: &quot;Heart Attack&quot; (No. 3 Pop) and &quot;Tied Up&quot; (No. 38 Pop). The tour was filmed for her &quot;Olivia in Concert&quot; television special, which premiered on HBO in January 1983. The special was subsequently released to video, earning Newton-John another Grammy nomination.

Newton-John reteamed with Travolta in 1983 for the critically and commercially unsuccessful movie &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;, redeemed by its platinum soundtrack (No. 26 Pop) featuring &quot;Twist of Fate&quot; (No. 5 Pop), &quot;Livin&#x27; in Desperate Times&quot; (No. 31 Pop), and a new duet with Travolta, &quot;Take a Chance&quot; (No. 3 AC). Newton-John released another video package, the Grammy-nominated &quot;Twist of Fate&quot;, featuring videos of her four songs on the &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; soundtrack and the two new singles from &quot;Olivia&#x27;s Greatest Hits Vol. 2&quot;.

That same year Newton-John and Pat Farrar (formerly Pat Carroll) founded Koala Blue. The store, originally for Australian imports, evolved into a chain of women&#x27;s clothing boutiques. The chain was initially successful, but it eventually declared bankruptcy and closed in 1992. Newton-John and Farrar were the targets of a multimillion-dollar lawsuit when Koala Blue franchise holders alleged breach of contract and unfair competition; agreeing with a motion citing insufficient evidence, a judge dismissed the case on summary judgment in 1993. Newton-John and Farrar later licensed the brand name for a line of Australian wines.
Newton-John, a supporter of Australian rules football Carlton, performed the Australian national anthem at the 1986 VFL Grand Final between Carlton and Hawthorn.

Newton-John&#x27;s music career cooled again with the release of her next studio album, the gold &quot;Soul Kiss&quot; (No. 29 Pop), in 1985. The album&#x27;s only charted single was the title track (No. 20 Pop, No. 20 AC). The video album for &quot;Soul Kiss&quot; featured only five of the album&#x27;s ten tracks (concept videos for the album&#x27;s singles &quot;Soul Kiss&quot; and &quot;Toughen Up&quot; as well as performance videos of the tracks &quot;Culture Shock&quot;, &quot;Emotional Tangle&quot; and &quot;The Right Moment&quot;).

After a nearly three-year hiatus following the birth of her daughter Chloe in January 1986, Newton-John resumed her recording career with the 1988 album &quot;The Rumour&quot;. The album was promoted by an HBO special, &quot;Olivia Down Under&quot;. Its first single, the title track, was written and produced by Elton John. Both the single (No. 62 Pop, No. 33 AC) and the album (No. 67 Pop) faltered commercially as the nearly 40-year-old Newton-John seemed &quot;old&quot; when compared with the teen queens Debbie Gibson and Tiffany ruling the pop charts at that time. (The album was praised by critics as more mature, with Newton-John addressing topics such as AIDS (&quot;Love and Let Live&quot;), the environment and single-parent households.)

The second single, &quot;Can&#x27;t We Talk It Over in Bed&quot;, did not chart, but was released in 1989 by Grayson Hugh, the song&#x27;s arranger, and became a top-20 pop hit as &quot;Talk It Over&quot;.

===1989‚Äì1998: Motherhood, cancer, and advocacy===
In September 1989, Newton-John released her self-described &quot;self-indulgent&quot; album, &quot;Warm and Tender&quot;, which reunited her with producer John Farrar, absent from her previous LP, and also marked a return to a more wholesome image. Inspired by her daughter, who appeared on the cover, the album featured lullabies and love songs for parents and their children. This album, the last one produced by Farrar, also failed to revive her recording career, as the disc reached only No. 124 Pop.

She was appointed a Goodwill ambassador to the United Nations Environment Programme.

Newton-John&#x27;s television work included starring in two Christmas films, &quot;A Mom for Christmas&quot; (1990) and &quot;A Christmas Romance&quot; (1994) ‚Äì both top 10 Nielsen hits.

Newton-John was primed for another comeback in 1992 when she compiled her third hits collection, &quot;Back to Basics: The Essential Collection 1971‚Äì1992&quot;, and planned her first tour since her &quot;Physical&quot; trek ten years earlier. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer, forcing her to cancel all publicity for the album, including the tour. She received her diagnosis the same weekend her father died.

Newton-John recovered. In 1991, she became the National Spokesperson for the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund/CHEC (Children&#x27;s Health Environmental Coalition) following the death from Wilms&#x27; tumour of five-year-old Colette Chuda, daughter of Newton-John&#x27;s friend Nancy Chuda. Later, Newton-John became an advocate for breast cancer research and other health issues. She was a product spokesperson for the Liv-Kit, a breast self-examination product, and also founded her own cancer centre in her home town in Australia. 

Newton-John&#x27;s cancer diagnosis also affected the type of music she recorded. In 1994, she released &quot;&quot;, which chronicled her ordeal. Co-produced by Newton-John for ONJ Productions, &quot;Gaia&quot; was originally issued by Festival in Australia but also distributed by various independent labels in Japan and Europe. In 2002, there was an American distribution by Hip-O Records, and a subsequent re-release in 2012 by Green Hill featured an alternative cover photo. &quot;Gaia&quot; was the first album on which Newton-John wrote all the music and lyrics herself, and this endeavour encouraged her to become more active as a songwriter thereafter. The single &quot;No Matter What You Do&quot; entered the Australian top 40, and the second single, the environmentally themed &quot;Don&#x27;t Cut Me Down&quot;, was also used in the film &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;, a 1996 AIDS drama. The Latin-fuelled &quot;Not Gonna Give into It&quot; eventually became heavily showcased in concert performance; &quot;The Way of Love&quot; was featured in the telefilm &quot;A Christmas Romance&quot;, and &quot;Trust Yourself&quot; was incorporated into both the TV-movie &quot;The Wilde Girls&quot; and the theatrical film &quot;Sordid Lives&quot;. 

Newton-John was listed as president of the Isle of Man Basking shark Society between 1998 and 2005. 

===1998‚Äì2012: Later releases===
Newton-John continued to record and perform pop-oriented music as well. In 1998, she returned to Nashville to record &quot;Back with a Heart&quot; (No. 59 Pop). The album returned her to the top 10 (No. 9) on the Country Albums chart. Its first single was a re-recording of &quot;I Honestly Love You&quot; produced by David Foster and featuring Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds on background vocals that charted on the Pop (No. 67) and AC (No. 18) charts. Country radio dismissed the song, though it did peak at No. 16 on the Country Sales chart. The album track, &quot;Love Is a Gift&quot;, won Newton-John a 1999 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song after being featured on the daytime serial, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.
During October‚ÄìDecember 1998, Newton-John, John Farnham and Anthony Warlow performed in The Main Event Tour. The album &quot;Highlights from The Main Event&quot; peaked at No. 1 in December, was certified 4√ó platinum, won an ARIA Award for Highest Selling Australian CD at the 1999 Awards and was also nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album.
For the 2000 Summer Olympics, Newton-John and Farnham re-teamed to perform &quot;Dare to Dream&quot; during the Parade of Nations at the Opening Ceremony. Broadcast of the ceremony was viewed by an estimated 3.5 billion people around the world.

In December 1998, following a hiatus of about 16 years, Newton-John also resumed touring by herself and in 2000 released a solo CD, &quot;One Woman&#x27;s Live Journey&quot;, her first live album since 1981&#x27;s &quot;Love Performance&quot;.

In 2000, she appeared in a dramatically different role as Bitsy Mae Harling, a bisexual former-convict country singer, in Del Shores&#x27; &quot;Sordid Lives&quot;. Newton-John reprised her role for &quot;Sordid Lives: The Series&quot; which aired one season on the LOGO television network. The series featured five original songs written and composed by Newton-John specifically for the show. In 2000, she teamed with Vince Gill and the London Symphony Orchestra for &quot;‚Ä≥Tis the Season&quot; sold exclusively through Hallmark. The following year, she released &quot;The Christmas Collection&quot;, which compiled seasonal music previously recorded for her Hallmark Christmas album, her appearance on Kenny Loggins&#x27; 1999 TNN Christmas special and her contributions to the &quot;Mother and Child&quot; and &quot;Spirit of Christmas&quot; multi-artist collections.

Newton-John&#x27;s subsequent albums were released primarily in Australia. In 2002, she released &quot;(2)&quot;, a duets album featuring mostly Australian artists (Tina Arena, Darren Hayes, Jimmy Little, Johnny O&#x27;Keefe, Billy Thorpe and Keith Urban), as well as a &quot;duet&quot; with the deceased Peter Allen. In addition, &quot;(2)&quot; offered a hidden 12th track, a samba version of &quot;Physical&quot; which Newton-John later performed occasionally in concert instead of the more rock-style original. The album&#x27;s 2004 Japanese release includes the bonus track &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, a duet with Cliff Richard with whom she had previously been coupled on &quot;Suddenly&quot; and &quot;Songs from Heathcliff&quot;.

In 2002, Newton-John was also inducted into Australia&#x27;s ARIA Hall of Fame.

Produced by Phil Ramone and recorded at the Indigo Recording Studios in Malibu for ONJ Productions, &quot;&quot; was released in October 2004 in Australia. The tribute album featured Newton-John covering songs by artists such as Joan Baez, the Carpenters, Doris Day, Nina Simone and Minnie Riperton. She dedicated the album to her mother, who had died the previous year of breast cancer. &quot;Indigo&quot; was subsequently released in the UK in April 2005 and in Japan in March 2006. A rebranded and resequenced version called &quot;Portraits: A Tribute to Great Women of Song&quot; was eventually issued in the United States in 2011.

In 2005, she released &quot;Stronger Than Before&quot;, sold exclusively in the United States by Hallmark. This was her second exclusive album for Hallmark Cards after her successful first Christmas album &quot;Tis the Season&quot; with Vince Gill five years earlier. Proceeds from the album&#x27;s sales benefited breast cancer research. The album featured the song &quot;Phenomenal Woman,&quot; based on the poem by Maya Angelou, and guest vocals from Diahann Carroll, Beth Nielsen Chapman, Delta Goodrem, Amy Holland, Patti LaBelle and Mindy Smith‚Äîall survivors of or affected by cancer.

In 2006, Newton-John released a healing CD, &quot;Grace and Gratitude&quot;. The album was sold exclusively by Walgreens, also to benefit various charities including Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization. The CD was the &quot;heart&quot; of their &quot;BodyHeartSpirit&quot; Wellness Collection, which also featured a re-branded Liv-Kit and breast-health dietary supplements.

In 2007, she re-teamed with her &quot;Grace and Gratitude&quot; producer, Amy Sky, for &quot;Christmas Wish&quot; (No. 187 Pop) which was sold exclusively by Target in its first year of release. Newton-John released another concert DVD, &quot;Olivia Newton-John and the Sydney Symphony: Live at the Sydney Opera House&quot; and a companion CD, her third live album titled &quot;Olivia&#x27;s Live Hits&quot;.

In 2008, she raised funds to help build the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Melbourne, Australia. She led a three-week, 228¬†km walk along the Great Wall of China during April, joined by various celebrities and cancer survivors throughout her trek. She released a companion CD, &quot;A Celebration in Song&quot;, the following month in Australia and later worldwide, featuring new and previously recorded duets by &quot;Olivia Newton-John &amp; Friends&quot;, including Jann Arden, Jimmy Barnes, John Farrar, Barry Gibb, Delta Goodrem, Sun Ho, Richard Marx, Cliff Richard, Melinda Schneider, Amy Sky, and Keith Urban.

In 2008, Newton-John took part in the BBC Wales program &quot;Coming Home&quot; about her Welsh family history. Also, in 2008, Newton-John joined Anne Murray on Murray&#x27;s last album, titled &quot;Duets: Friends &amp; Legends&quot;. She sang Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s hit &quot;Cotton Jenny&quot; with Murray.

She re-recorded some tracks from &quot;Grace and Gratitude&quot; in 2010 and re-released the album as &quot;Grace and Gratitude Renewed&quot; on the Green Hill music label. The &quot;Renewed&quot; CD includes a new track, &quot;Help Me to Heal&quot;, not featured on the original album.

Newton-John was featured in UniGlobe Entertainment&#x27;s breast cancer docu-drama, &quot;1 a Minute&quot;, released in October 2010. The documentary was made by actress Namrata Singh Gujral and featured other celebrities who had survived breast cancer or who were affected by the disease. During the same month, Bluewater Productions released a comic book featuring Newton-John to coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

In 2010, Newton-John starred in the film &quot;&quot;, released in Canada. She portrayed Hope Gordon, the mother of a home-schooled hockey prodigy. The film opened the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival.

Newton-John guest-starred as herself in the sitcoms &quot;Ned and Stacey&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; and &quot;Bette&quot; and also made two appearances as herself on &quot;Glee&quot;.

For her first &quot;Glee&quot; appearance, Newton-John recreated her &quot;Physical&quot; video with series regular Jane Lynch. The performance was released as a digital single which peaked at number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 2010. In Australia, Newton-John hosted the animal and nature series &quot;Wild Life&quot; and guest-starred as Joanna on two episodes of the Australian series &quot;The Man From Snowy River&quot;.

In January 2011, Newton-John began filming the comedy &quot;A Few Best Men&quot; in Australia with director Stephan Elliott, in the role of mother of the bride. The groom is played by Xavier Samuel.

=== 2012‚Äì2022: Vegas residency and final releases ===
Newton-John was actively touring and doing concerts from 2012 to 2017 and also performed a handful of shows in 2018. Her dates for A Summer Night with Olivia Newton-John even included stops in Asia and Canada and culminated in a rare concert appearance in London in 2013. Her March 2013 UK trek also encompassed Bournemouth, Brighton, Birmingham, Manchester and Cardiff, Wales.

In November 2012, Newton-John teamed with John Travolta to make the charity album &quot;This Christmas&quot;, in support of The Olivia Newton-John Cancer &amp; Wellness Centre and the Jett Travolta Foundation. Artists featured on the album include: Barbra Streisand, James Taylor, Chick Corea, Kenny G, Tony Bennett, Cliff Richard and the Count Basie Orchestra.

A 2013 residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas was postponed due to the May 2013 death of her elder sister, Rona (aged 72), from a brain tumour. Newton-John resumed performing, doing 45 shows beginning in April 2014. Along with the Vegas shows, Newton-John released a new EP in April 2014 entitled &quot;Hotel Sessions&quot;, which consisted of seven tracks of unreleased demos that were recorded between 2002 and 2011 with her nephew Brett Goldsmith. The CD contains a cover of &quot;Broken Wings&quot; as well as the popular-with-fans original &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, which had leaked on the internet many years prior.

Her Vegas stay was eventually extended beyond August 2014, and her Summer Nights residency finished in December 2016 after 175 shows. Her successful three-year run even prompted a fourth live album, &quot;Summer Nights: Live in Las Vegas&quot; (2015). In 2015, Newton-John also reunited with John Farnham for a joint venture called &quot;Two Strong Hearts Live&quot;.
In 2015, Newton-John was a guest judge on an episode of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. That same year, she scored her first number-one single on &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart with &quot;You Have to Believe&quot; with daughter Chloe and producer Dave Aud√©. The song was a re-imagining of her 1980 single &quot;Magic&quot;, which she noted was to celebrate both the 35th anniversary of &quot;Xanadu&quot; and as a dedication to her daughter. About the latter, Newton-John stated: &quot;I met Chloe&#x27;s dad on the set of &quot;Xanadu;&quot; so, without that film, Chloe wouldn&#x27;t be here. She was the real &#x27;magic&#x27; that came out of that film!&quot; The song became the first mother-daughter single to reach No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Play chart.

In 2015, Newton-John was inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.

In 2017, she collaborated with two North American singer-songwriters, Beth Nielsen Chapman and Amy Sky, on a joint concert tour entitled Liv On after co-producing a 2016 CD by the same name.

On 7 May 2019, Newton-John&#x27;s elder brother Hugh, a doctor, died at age 80; his death left Newton-John as the sole surviving sibling from the original family.

In recognition for &quot;her work as an entertainer and philanthropist&quot;, she was bestowed Australia&#x27;s highest honour, the Companion of the Order of Australia, in June 2019.

In December 2019, Newton-John and Travolta also re-teamed for three live Meet &#x27;n&#x27; Grease sing-along events in the Florida cities of Tampa, West Palm Beach and Jacksonville. Subsequently, a sing-along re-broadcast of &quot;Grease&quot; aired on CBS Television.

In February 2020, Newton-John appeared at the Fire Fight Australia charity event. This was her final public performance.

In January 2021, Newton-John released her final single, &quot;Window in the Wall&quot;, a duet about unity which she recorded with her daughter Chloe Lattanzi. The music video for the song peaked at No. 1 on the iTunes pop music video chart the week of its release.

==In the media==
On 2 November 2019, Julien&#x27;s Auctions auctioned hundreds of memorabilia items from Newton-John&#x27;s career. The sale raised $2.4 million. Newton-John&#x27;s &quot;Grease&quot; outfit garnered $405,700; her pants and jacket were purchased separately by two different billionaires. Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx, bought Newton-John&#x27;s black skintight pants from &quot;Grease&quot; for $162,000. The anonymous buyer who acquired her famous &quot;Grease&quot; leather jacket for $243,200 (¬£185,000) returned the item to her and said: &quot;It should not sit in a billionaire&#x27;s closet for country-club bragging rights [...] The odds of beating a recurring cancer using the newest emerging therapies is a thousandfold greater than someone appearing out of the blue, buying your most famous and cherished icon, and returning it to you.&quot; All proceeds were donated to her Cancer Wellness and Research Centre in Australia.

In December 2024 and January 2025, Julien&#x27;s and TCM also held posthumous sales of Newton-John commemoratives.

==Musical legacy ==
Newton-John&#x27;s first boyfriend, Ian Turpie, once said of her early appearances: &quot;In those days she had a small voice, but it was very pure. She could sing prettily in tune...The improvement in her singing since she went to England has been remarkable. She told me Shirley Bassey has been a big influence on her. After hearing Bassey, she worked at developing her head voice to sound like a chest voice, the way Bassey uses hers. The power she&#x27;s developed is amazing&quot;.

Michael Dwyer of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; maintains that following Newton-John&#x27;s career was like watching &quot;our slightly older and braver sister growing up in public&quot; and her passing &quot;feels today like a lost member of the family&quot;. Rachel Syme of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; also suggests that her familial, down-to-earth demeanor and humanity may have even superseded her singing accomplishments: &quot;Her most lasting legacy might be as the rare celebrity who was almost universally well liked, and thought of as an essentially kind and warmhearted person&quot;. 

Her musical abilities on their own merits were also impressive. In her 1982 &quot;Olivia in Concert&quot; performance of Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Jolene,&quot; Newton-John showcases a down-falling note range covering three octaves. (Much later, Newton-John and Parton recorded a duet of &quot;Jolene,&quot; which was not formally released until after Newton-John&#x27;s death.) In her memoir, Newton-John describes herself as &quot;not a power singer but more of an interpretive one&quot;; and author Lauren O&#x27;Neill concurs: &quot;She sang with clarity and precision, her high notes bright and open like a window on a summer morning, but her voice was never clinical ‚Äì a sultry purr, euphoric cry or breathy gasp seemed always available to her...Her vocal [on &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; from &quot;Grease&quot;] is clean and soaring, but to hear it is to be right down in the dirt with Sandy too; to feel, and perhaps even identify with, her total frustration with herself. As she slides between notes while singing &#x27;I&#x27;m out of my head,&#x27; she shows us her emotional freefall as well as telling us about it.&quot;

Long before and after the career summit of &quot;Grease&quot;, Newton-John proved herself to be a fairly versatile performer, lending her instrument to everything from sentimental ballads and New Age soul searching to lively dance productions and rock &amp; soul fervor. Maura Johnston of &quot;Vulture&quot; assesses: &quot;Newton-John was a regular chart-topper...throughout the &#x27;70s, her lithe soprano adapting well to the soft pop sound&quot; of the era with &quot;&quot;AM Gold&quot; staples and tracks from the folk and country world...As it turned out, Newton-John&#x27;s voice was pretty well suited to the spiky dance pop that would become popular in the early 1980s&quot; too. However, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; offers a counterpoint on her career decline in the mid-1980s: &quot;Hardness never was Newton-John&#x27;s comfort zone, though, and the 1980s were a much harder decade than the 1970s. The inherent warmth of 1970s studio sessions gave way to the cold, synthesized gleam of the 1980s, a sterile sound that suited her well only once: the candied faux-new wave of &#x27;Twist of Fate&#x27;&quot;, produced by David Foster. Johnston further maintains: &quot;Her pop heyday transcended any attempts to musically pigeonhole her&quot;; and by the time she stopped having many new hits, &quot;her musical legacy ... had been pretty well solidified.&quot;

Newton-John&#x27;s work has inspired many other female vocalists, including Juliana Hatfield, Lisa Loeb, Kylie Minogue, Delta Goodrem, Natalie Maines and Alanis Morissette. Pink staged a commemorative Newton-John cover during the 2022 American Music Awards. At the 2022 ARIA Music Awards, a special tribute in her honour featured performances by Natalie Imbruglia, Peking Duk and Tones and I.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
In the mid-1960s, Newton-John dated Australian actor and singer Ian Turpie, her co-star in the 1965 musical film &quot;Funny Things Happen Down Under&quot;. They met in 1963 when Turpie attended the coffee shop where Newton-John&#x27;s group Sol Four performed. The relationship continued until she returned to England in 1966.

In 1968, Newton-John was engaged to but never married Bruce Welch, one of her early producers and co-writer of her hit &quot;Please Mr. Please&quot;. In 1972, Newton-John ended her relationship with Welch, who subsequently attempted suicide.

In 1973, while vacationing on the French Riviera, Newton-John met British businessman Lee Kramer, who became both her new boyfriend and manager. Newton-John lived with Kramer on and off and they stayed a couple until 1979; she called their turbulent pairing &quot;one long breakup&quot;. Kramer subsequently returned to England and married. He also managed vocalist Krishna Das. Kramer died in 2017.

Newton-John married her long-time, live-in partner, actor Matt Lattanzi, in December 1984. The pair had met in 1980 while filming &quot;Xanadu&quot;. They announced their separation in April 1995, and they divorced in 1996. According to &quot;People&quot; magazine, people close to the twosome cited the disparity between her spiritual interests and his more earthly ones as a key factor in the dissolution. The couple remained friends. Their daughter, Chloe Rose, was born in January 1986.

Newton-John met gaffer/cameraman Patrick McDermott soon after her divorce from Lattanzi. They dated on and off for nine years. McDermott vanished during a 2005 fishing trip off the Californian coast. Newton-John was in Australia at her Gaia Retreat &amp; Spa at the time of McDermott&#x27;s disappearance. A United States Coast Guard investigation, based on then-available evidence and released in 2008, &quot;suggest[ed] McDermott was lost at sea&quot;, with a friend telling investigators McDermott had appeared sad though not despondent after their breakup. In April 2010, a private investigator, hired by an American television program, claimed that McDermott is alive and had faked his death for a life insurance payout ‚Äì but did not provide proof beyond their own statement that they were confident. Unsubstantiated claims have been made, particularly in Australian tabloids, that McDermott is living in Mexico.

In 1993, Newton-John met John Easterling, founder and president of the Amazon Herb Company, which he started in 1990 and sold to TriVita, Inc., in 2012. Also known as &quot;Amazon John&quot;, Easterling is an eco-entrepreneur who initially marketed rainforest botanicals and currently owns and operates Happy Tree Microbes, which offers natural plant performance products. When Newton-John and Easterling first met, they were both married to other people. In 2007, they started dating and married in an Incan spiritual ceremony in Peru on 21 June 2008, followed by a legal ceremony nine days later (30 June 2008) on Jupiter Island, Florida.

===Residences and citizenship===
Although principally raised in Australia, Newton-John remained a British subject throughout her childhood. She initially pursued Australian citizenship in 1981 with an application that Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was asked to expedite. However, she finally became an Australian citizen in 1994.

In 1973, Newton-John purchased a modest one-bedroom flat in northwest London.

After relocating from England to the United States in late 1974, Newton-John set up residence in Malibu, California, where for 35 years she owned various real estate, including a horse ranch and several beachfront properties.

In June 2009, Newton-John and her second husband, John Easterling, purchased a new $4.1¬†million home in Jupiter Inlet, Florida. In 2013, while renovations were being done on the property and the couple was not there, a contractor named Christopher Pariseleti committed suicide on the estate, which at the time was up for sale. Following the death on the premises, Newton-John and Easterling bought a nearby condo; their larger home lingered on and off the market for two years but was eventually sold in 2015 to a Swedish advertising executive for $5.1 million.

In 2015, the couple purchased a $5.3 million, 12-acre horse ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley outside Santa Barbara.

In 2019, Newton-John sold her 187-acre Australian farm, which she had owned for nearly 40 years and is located near Byron Bay in New South Wales. The Dalwood estate sold for $4.6 million; in 1980, Newton-John had paid $622,000 for the property, which had additional land adjoined in both 1983 and in 2002.

Newton-John was also partial owner of Byron Bay&#x27;s Gaia Retreat &amp; Spa, which was founded in 2005 and sold in 2021 for $30 million to the investment firm of Tattarang.

When asked in 2017 whether she considered herself to be a British, Australian or American citizen, she said, &quot;I am still Australian.&quot; In December 2019, upon being given the title of Dame, she expressed her thanks by stating: &quot;As a girl born in Cambridge [England], I am very proud of my British ancestry and so appreciative to be recognised in this way by the United Kingdom.&quot;

==Illness and death==
In May 2017, it was announced that Newton-John&#x27;s breast cancer had returned and metastasised to her lower back. Her back pains had initially been diagnosed as sciatica. She subsequently revealed this was actually her third bout with breast cancer, as she did have a recurrence of the disease in 2013 in addition to her initial 1992 diagnosis. With the 2017 recurrence, the cancer had spread to her bones and progressed to stage IV. Newton-John experienced significant pain from the metastatic bone lesions and had spoken of using cannabis oil to ease her pain. She was an advocate for the use of medical cannabis; her daughter Chloe owns a cannabis farm in Oregon.

Newton-John died on 8 August 2022, at the age of 73, at her home in the Santa Ynez Valley of California. Tributes were paid by John Travolta, Barbra Streisand, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and many other celebrities. As a mark of respect, Melbourne and Sydney lit up many of their landmarks.

In September 2022, Newton-John&#x27;s family held a &quot;small and very private&quot; memorial service in California for the singer, who asked to be cremated and have her ashes scattered in Byron Bay, on her Santa Ynez ranch and &quot;in other places that I love&quot;.

The State of Victoria offered Newton-John&#x27;s family a state funeral, which her niece Tottie Goldsmith accepted. Newton-John&#x27;s Australian memorial service, hosted by David Campbell, was held on 26 February 2023 at Hamer Hall in Melbourne and included eulogies from her widower and daughter; a testimonial to her strength of character, optimism and magnanimity by television personality Richard Wilkins; montages of her career, family life and wellness centre; a medley of her hits performed by Delta Goodrem, and pre-recorded video tributes from Elton John, Mariah Carey, Barry Gibb, Dolly Parton and Nicole Kidman.

<doc id="53258" wikidata="Q220344" url="?curid=53258" title="Pythia">
<text>Pythia (; ) was the title of the high priestess of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. She specifically served as its oracle and was known as the Oracle of Delphi. Her title was also historically glossed in English as the Pythoness.

The Pythia was established at the latest in the 8th century BC, (though some estimates date the shrine to as early as 1400 BC), and was widely credited for her prophecies uttered under divine possession (enthusiasmos) by Apollo. The Pythian priestess emerged pre-eminent by the end of the 7th century BC and continued to be consulted until the late 4th century AD. During this period, the Delphic Oracle was the most prestigious and authoritative oracle among the Greeks, and she was among the most powerful women of the classical world. The oracle is one of the best-documented religious institutions of the classical Greeks. Authors who mention the oracle include Aeschylus, Aristotle, Clement of Alexandria, Diodorus, Diogenes, Euripides, Herodotus, Julian, Justin, Livy, Lucan, Nepos, Ovid, Pausanias, Pindar, Plato, Plutarch, Sophocles, Strabo, Thucydides, and Xenophon.

Nevertheless, details of how the Pythia operated are scarce, missing, or non-existent, as authors from the classical period (6th to 4th centuries BC) treat the process as common knowledge with no need to explain. Those who discussed the oracle in any detail are from 1st century BC to 4th century AD and give conflicting stories. One of the main stories claimed that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapours rising from a chasm in the rock, and that she spoke gibberish which priests interpreted as the enigmatic prophecies and turned them into poetic dactylic hexameters preserved in Greek literature. This idea, however, has been challenged by scholars such as Joseph Fontenrose and Lisa Maurizio, who argue that the ancient sources uniformly represent the Pythia speaking intelligibly, and giving prophecies in her own voice. Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC, describes the Pythia speaking in dactylic hexameters.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Pythia&quot; is derived from &quot;pythia hiereia&quot; (), meaning ; it is related to &quot;Pythios&quot; (), an epithet of Apollo, itself deriving from &quot;Pytho&quot;, which in myth was the original name of Delphi. As such, the word is likely related to Python, the name of the mythical snake that was slain by Apollo near Delphi. Etymologically, the Greeks derived this place name from the verb () &#x27;to rot&#x27;, which refers to the sickly sweet smell from the decomposing body of the monstrous Python after it was slain by Apollo.

==Origins==

The Delphic oracle may have been present in some form from 1400 BC, in the middle period of Mycenaean Greece (1750‚Äì1050 BC). There is evidence that Apollo supposedly took over the shrine with the arrival of priests from Delos in the 8th century, from an earlier dedication to Gaia. The 8th-century reformulation of the Oracle at Delphi as a shrine to Apollo seems associated with the rise in importance of the city of Corinth and the importance of sites in the Corinthian Gulf.

The earliest account of the origin of the Delphic oracle is provided in the Homeric Hymn to Delphic Apollo, which recent scholarship dates within a narrow range, c. 580‚Äì570 BC. It describes in detail how Apollo chose his first priests, whom he selected in their &quot;swift ship&quot;; they were &quot;Cretans from Minos&#x27; city of Knossos&quot; who were voyaging to sandy Pylos. But Apollo, who had as one of his cult epithets, leapt into the ship in the form of a dolphin (, gen. ). Dolphin-Apollo revealed himself to the terrified Cretans and bade them follow him up to the &quot;place where you will have rich offerings&quot;. The Cretans &quot;danced in time and followed, singing , like the paeans of the Cretans in whose breasts the divine Muse has placed &quot;honey-voiced singing&quot;. &quot;Paean&quot; seems to have been the name by which Apollo was known in Mycenaean times.

G. L. Huxley observes: &quot;If the hymn to (Delphic) Apollo conveys a historical message, it is above all that there were once Cretan priests at Delphi.&quot; Robin Lane Fox notes that Cretan bronzes are found at Delphi from the eighth century onwards, and Cretan sculptures are dedicated as late as c. 620‚Äì600 BC: &quot;Dedications at the site cannot establish the identity of its priesthood, but for once we have an explicit text to set beside the archaeological evidence.&quot; An early visitor to these &quot;dells of Parnassus&quot;, at the end of the eighth century, was Hesiod, who was shown the &quot;omphalos&quot;.

There are many later stories of the origins of the Delphic Oracle. One late explanation, which is first related by the 1st century BC writer Diodorus Siculus, tells of a goat herder named Coretas, who noticed one day that one of his goats, who fell into a crack in the earth, was behaving strangely. On entering the chasm, he found himself filled with a divine presence and the ability to see outside of the present, into the past and the future. Excited by his discovery, he shared it with nearby villagers. Many started visiting the site to experience the convulsions and inspirational trances, though some were said to disappear into the cleft due to their frenzied state. A shrine was erected at the site, where people began worshipping in the late Bronze Age, by 1600 BC. After the deaths of a number of men, the villagers chose a single young woman as the liaison for the divine inspirations. Eventually, she came to speak on behalf of the gods.

According to earlier myths, the office of the oracle was initially possessed by the goddesses Themis and Phoebe, and the site was initially sacred to Gaia. Subsequently, it was believed to be sacred to Poseidon, the god of earthquakes. During the Greek Dark Age, from the 11th to the 9th century BC, a new god of prophecy, Apollo, was said to have seized the temple and expelled the twin guardian serpents of Gaia, whose bodies he wrapped around the caduceus. Later myths stated that Phoebe or Themis had &quot;given&quot; the site to Apollo, rendering its seizure by priests of the new god justified, but presumably having to retain the priestesses of the original oracle because of the long tradition. It is possible that the myths portray Poseidon as mollified by the gift of a new site in Troizen.

Diodorus explained how, initially, the Pythia was an appropriately clad young virgin, for great emphasis was placed on the Oracle&#x27;s chastity and purity to be reserved for union with the god Apollo. But he reports one story as follows:

The scholar Martin Litchfield West writes that the Pythia shows many traits of shamanistic practices, likely inherited or influenced from Central Asian practices, although there is no evidence of any such association at this time. He cites the Pythia sitting in a cauldron on a tripod, while making her prophecies in an ecstatic trance state, like shamans, and her utterings unintelligible.

According to William Godwin, the tripod was perforated with holes, and as she inhaled the vapors, her figure would seem to enlarge, her hair stood on end, her complexion changed, her heart panted, her bosom swelled, and her voice became seemingly more than human.

==Organization of the Oracle==

===Priestess===
Since the first operation of the oracle of the Temple of Delphi, it was believed that the god lived within a laurel (his holy plant) and gave oracles for the future with the rustling of the leaves. It was also said that the art of divination had been taught to the god by the three winged sisters of Parnassus, the Thriae, at the time when Apollo was grazing his cattle there. The Thriae used to have a (oracle by lot) in that area in the past and it is possible that such was the first oracle of Delphi, i.e. using the lot (throwing lots in a container and pulling a lot, the color and shape of which were of particular importance).

Three oracles had successively operated in Delphi ‚Äì the using (a procedure that involved sleeping in the holy place, so as to experience a revealing dream), the and finally the Apollonian, with the laurel. But ever since the introduction of the cult of Dionysus at Delphi, the god that brought his followers into ecstasy and madness, the Delphic god gave oracles through Pythia, who also fell into a trance under the influence of vapors and fumes coming from the opening, the inner sanctum of the Oracle. Pythia sat on top of a tall gilded tripod that stood above the opening. In the old days, Pythia was a virgin, young girl, but after Echecrates of Thessaly kidnapped and violated a young and beautiful Pythia in the late 3rd century BC, a woman older than fifty years old was chosen, who dressed and wore jewelry to resemble a young maiden girl. According to tradition, Phemonoe was the first Pythia.

Though little is known of how the priestess was chosen, the Pythia was probably selected, at the death of her predecessor, from amongst a guild of priestesses of the temple. These women were all natives of Delphi and were required to have had a sober life and be of good character. Although some were married, upon assuming their role as the Pythia, the priestesses ceased all family responsibilities, marital relations, and individual identity. In the heyday of the oracle, the Pythia may have been a woman chosen from an influential family, well educated in geography, politics, history, philosophy, and the arts. During later periods, however, uneducated peasant women were chosen for the role, which may explain why the poetic pentameter or hexameter prophecies of the early period were later made only in prose. Often, the priestess&#x27;s answers to questions would be put into hexameter by a priest. The archaeologist John Hale reports that:

The job of a priestess, especially the Pythia, was a respectable career for Greek women. Priestesses enjoyed many liberties and rewards for their social position, such as freedom from taxation, the right to own property and attend public events, a salary and housing provided by the state, a wide range of duties depending on their affiliation, and often gold crowns.

During the main period of the oracle&#x27;s popularity, as many as three women served as Pythia, another vestige of the triad, with two taking turns in giving prophecy and another kept in reserve. Only one day of the month could the priestess be consulted.

Plutarch said that the Pythia&#x27;s life was shortened through the service of Apollo. The sessions were said to be exhausting. At the end of each period the Pythia would be like a runner after a race or a dancer after an ecstatic dance, which may have had a physical effect on the health of the Pythia.

===Other officiants===
Several other officiants served the oracle in addition to the Pythia. After 200 BC, at any given time, there were two priests of Apollo, who were in charge of the entire sanctuary; Plutarch, who served as a priest during the late first century and early second century CE, gives us the most information about the organization of the oracle at that time. Before 200 BC, while the temple was dedicated to Apollo, there was probably only one priest of Apollo. Priests were chosen from among the main citizens of Delphi, and were appointed for life. In addition to overseeing the oracle, priests would also conduct sacrifices at other festivals of Apollo, and had charge of the Pythian Games. Earlier arrangements, before the temple became dedicated to Apollo, are not documented.

The other officiants associated with the oracle are less well known. These are the &#x27; (, &#x27;holy ones&#x27;) and the &#x27; (, singular ). is the origin of the English word &quot;prophet&quot;, with the meaning &#x27;one who forespeaks, one who foretells&#x27;. The are referred to in literary sources, but their function is unclear; it has been suggested that they interpreted the Pythia&#x27;s prophecies, or even reformatted her utterances into verse, but it has also been argued that the term &quot;&quot; is a generic reference to any cult officials of the sanctuary, including the Pythia. There were five , whose responsibilities are unknown, but may have been involved in some manner with the operation of the oracle.

===Oracular procedure===
In the traditions associated with Apollo, the oracle gave prophecies during the nine warmest months of each year. During winter months, Apollo was said to have deserted his temple, his place being taken by his divine half-brother Dionysus, whose tomb was also within the temple. It is not known whether the Oracle participated with the Dionysian rites of the Maenads or Thyades in the Korykion cave on Mount Parnassos, although Plutarch informs us that his friend Clea was both a Priestess to Apollo and to the secret rites of Dionysus. The male priests seem to have had their own ceremonies to the dying and resurrecting god. Apollo was said to return at the beginning of spring, on the seventh day of the month of Bysios, his birthday. This would reiterate the absences of the great goddess Demeter in winter also, which would have been a part of the earliest traditions.

Once a month, thereafter, the oracle would undergo purification rites, including fasting, to ceremonially prepare the Pythia for communications with the divine. On the seventh day of each month, she would be led by two attended oracular priests, with her face veiled in purple. A priest would then declaim:

&lt;poem&gt;Servant of the Delphian Apollo
Go to the Castallian Spring
Wash in its silvery eddies,
And return cleansed to the temple.
Guard your lips from offence
To those who ask for oracles.
Let the God&#x27;s answer come
Pure from all private fault.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Pythia would then bathe naked in the Castalian Spring, then drink the holier waters of the Cassotis, which flowed closer to the temple, where a naiad possessing magical powers was said to live. Euripides described this ritual purification ceremony, starting first with the priest Ion dancing on the highest point of Mount Parnassus, going about his duties within the temple, and sprinkling the temple floor with holy water. The purification ceremonies always were performed on the seventh day of the month, which was sacred to and associated with the god Apollo. Then, escorted by the , an aristocratic council of five, with a crowd of oracular servants, they would arrive at the temple. Consultants, carrying laurel branches sacred to Apollo, approached the temple along the winding upward course of the Sacred Way, bringing a young goat kid for sacrifice in the forecourt of the temple, and a monetary fee.

Inscribed on a column in the pronaos (forecourt) of the temple were an enigmatic &quot;E&quot; and three maxims:

# Know thyself
# Nothing to excess
# Surety brings ruin, or &quot;make a pledge and mischief is nigh&quot; ()

These seem to have played an important part in the temple ritual. According to Plutarch&#x27;s essay on the meaning of the &quot;E at Delphi&quot; (the only literary source for the E inscription), there have been various interpretations of this letter. In ancient times, the origin of these phrases was attributed to one or more of the Seven Sages of Greece.

Pythia would then remove her purple veil. She would wear a short plain white dress. At the temple fire to Hestia, a live goat kid would be set in front of the altar and sprinkled with water. If the kid trembled from the hooves upward it was considered a good omen for the oracle, but if it did not, the enquirer was considered to have been rejected by the god and the consultation was terminated. If it were a good omen, however, the goat would subsequently be sacrificed to Apollo. In turn, the animal&#x27;s organs, particularly its liver, were examined to ensure the signs were favorable, and then burned outside on the altar of Chios. The rising smoke was a signal that the oracle was open. The Oracle then descended into the &quot;adyton&quot; (Greek for &#x27;inaccessible&#x27;) and mounted her tripod seat, holding laurel leaves and a dish of Kassotis spring water into which she gazed. Nearby was the &quot;omphalos&quot; (Greek for &#x27;navel&#x27;), which was flanked by two solid gold eagles representing the authority of Zeus, and the cleft from which emerged the sacred pneuma.

Petitioners drew lots to determine the order of admission, but representatives of a city-state or those who brought larger donations to Apollo were secured a higher place in line. Each person approaching the oracle was accompanied with a specific to the state of the petitioner, whose job was to identify the citizen of their . This service, too, was paid for.

Plutarch describes the events of one session in which the omens were ill-favored, but the Oracle was consulted nonetheless. The priests proceeded to receive the prophecy, but the result was a hysterical uncontrollable reaction from the priestess that resulted in her death a few days later.

At times when the Pythia was not available, consultants could obtain guidance by asking simple yes-or-no questions to the priests. A response was returned through the tossing of colored beans, one color designating &quot;yes&quot;, another &quot;no&quot;. Little else is known of this practice.

Between 535 and 615 of the Oracles (statements) of Delphi are known to have survived since classical times, of which over half are said to be accurate historically (see List of oracular statements from Delphi for examples).

Cicero noted no expedition was undertaken, no colony sent out, and no affair of any distinguished individuals went on without the sanction of the oracle.

The early fathers of the Christian church believed demons were allowed to assist them to spread idolatry, so that the need for a savior would be more evident.

===Experience of supplicants===
In antiquity, the people who went to the Oracle to ask for advice were known as &quot;consultants&quot;, literally, &quot;those who seek counsel&quot;. It would appear that the supplicant to the oracle would undergo a four-stage process, typical of shamanic journeys.

* Step 1: Journey to Delphi‚ÄîSupplicants were motivated by some need to undertake the long and sometimes arduous journey to Delphi in order to consult the oracle. This journey was motivated by an awareness of the existence of the oracle, the growing motivation on the part of the individual or group to undertake the journey, and the gathering of information about the oracle as providing answers to important questions.
* Step 2: Preparation of the supplicant‚ÄîSupplicants were interviewed in preparation of their presentation to the Oracle, by the priests in attendance. The genuine cases were sorted and the supplicant had to go through rituals involving the framing of their questions, the presentation of gifts to the Oracle and a procession along the Sacred Way carrying laurel leaves to visit the temple, symbolic of the journey they had made.
* Step 3: Visit to the Oracle‚ÄîThe supplicant would then be led into the temple to visit the &quot;adyton&quot;, put his question to the Pythia, receive his answer and depart. The degree of preparation already undergone would mean that the supplicant was already in a very aroused and meditative state, similar to the shamanic journey elaborated on in the article.
* Step 4: Return home‚ÄîOracles were meant to give advice to shape future action, that was meant to be implemented by the supplicant, or by those that had sponsored the supplicant to visit the Oracle. The validity of the Oracular utterance was confirmed by the consequences of the application of the oracle to the lives of those people who sought Oracular guidance.

==Temple of Apollo==
The ruins of the Temple of Delphi visible today date from the 4th century¬†BC, and are of a peripteral Doric building. It was erected on the remains of an earlier temple, dated to the 6th century BC, which itself was erected on the site of a 7th-century-BC construction attributed to the architects Trophonios and Agamedes.

The 6th-century BC temple was named the &quot;Temple of Alcmaeonidae&quot; in tribute to the Athenian family who funded its reconstruction following a fire, which had destroyed the original structure. The new building was a Doric hexastyle temple of 6¬†by¬†15 columns. This temple was destroyed in 373¬†BC by an earthquake. The pediment sculptures are a tribute to Praxias and Androsthenes of Athens. Of a similar proportion to the second temple it retained the 6¬†by¬†15 column pattern around the stylobate. Inside was the adyton, the centre of the Delphic oracle and seat of Pythia. The temple had the statement &quot;Know thyself&quot;, one of the Delphic maxims, carved into it (and some modern Greek writers say the rest were carved into it), and the maxims were attributed to Apollo and given through the Oracle and/or the Seven Sages of Greece (&quot;know thyself&quot; perhaps also being attributed to other famous philosophers).

The temple survived until AD 390, when the Roman emperor Theodosius I silenced the oracle by destroying the temple and most of the statues and works of art to remove all traces of paganism.

==Scientific explanations==

===Fumes and vapors===
There have been many attempts to find a scientific explanation for the Pythia&#x27;s inspiration. Most commonly, these refer to an observation made by Plutarch, who presided as high priest at Delphi for several years, who stated that her oracular powers appeared to be associated with vapors from the Kerna spring waters that flowed under the temple. It has often been suggested that these vapors may have been hallucinogenic gases.

Recent geological investigations have suggested that gas emissions from a geologic chasm in the earth could have inspired the Delphic Oracle to &quot;connect with the divine&quot;. Some researchers suggest the possibility that ethylene gas caused the Pythia&#x27;s state of inspiration, based on the matching symptoms, ethylene&#x27;s use as an anesthetic, and the smell of the chamber, as described by Plutarch. Traces of ethylene have been found in the waters of the Castallian spring, which is now largely diverted for the town water supply of the town of modern Delphi. However, Lehoux argues that ethylene is &quot;impossible&quot; and benzene is &quot;crucially underdetermined&quot;. Others argue instead that methane might have been the gas emitted from the chasm, or and , arguing that the chasm itself might have been a seismic ground rupture.

Oleander, in contemporary toxicological literature, has also been considered responsible for contributing symptoms similar to those of the Pythia. The Pythia used oleander as a complement during the oracular procedure, chewing its leaves and inhaling their smoke. The toxic substances of oleander results in symptoms similar to those of epilepsy, the &quot;sacred disease&quot;, which could have amounted to the possession of the Pythia by the spirit of Apollo, rendering Pythia his spokesperson and prophetess. The oleander fumes (the &quot;spirit of Apollo&quot;) could have originated in a brazier located in an underground chamber (the antron) and have escaped through an opening (the &quot;chasm&quot;) in the temple&#x27;s floor. This hypothesis fits the findings of the archaeological excavations that revealed an underground space under the temple. This explanation sheds light on the alleged spirit and chasm of Delphi, that have been the subject of intense debate and interdisciplinary research for the last hundred years.

Regardless of which fumes existed in the chasm, winter months would bring cooler weather, decreasing release of gases in the chamber. This offers a plausible explanation for the absence of summer deities in winter months. A toxic gas also explains the reason why the Pythia could only venture into her oracular chamber once a month, both to coincide with the correct concentration of gases, and to prolong the already-short lifespan of the Pythia by limiting her exposure to such fumes.

===Excavations===
Beginning during 1892, a team of French archaeologists directed by Th√©ophile Homolle of the Coll√®ge de France excavated the site at Delphi. Contrary to ancient literature, they found no fissure and no possible means for the production of fumes.

Adolphe Paul Opp√© published an influential article in 1904, which made three crucial claims: No chasm or vapor ever existed; no natural gas could create prophetic visions; and the recorded incidents of a priestess undergoing violent and often deadly reactions was inconsistent with the more customary reports. Opp√© explained away all the ancient testimony as being reports of gullible travelers fooled by wily local guides who, Opp√© believed, invented the details of a chasm and a vapor in the first place.

In accordance with this definitive statement, such scholars as Frederick Poulson, E. R. Dodds, Joseph Fontenrose, and Saul Levin all stated that there were no vapors and no chasm. For the decades to follow, scientists and scholars believed the ancient descriptions of a sacred, inspiring pneuma to be fallacious. During 1950, the French hellenist Pierre Amandry, who had worked at Delphi and later directed the French excavations there, concurred with Opp√©&#x27;s pronouncements, claiming that gaseous emissions were not even possible in a volcanic zone such as Delphi. Neither Opp√© nor Amandry were geologists, though, and no geologists had been involved in the debate up to that point.

Subsequent re-examination of the French excavations, however, has shown that this consensus may have been mistaken. Broad (2007) demonstrates that a French photograph of the excavated interior of the temple clearly depicts a springlike pool as well as a number of small vertical fissures, indicating numerous pathways by which vapors could enter the base of the temple.

During the 1980s, the interdisciplinary team of geologist Jelle Zeilinga de Boer, archaeologist John R. Hale, forensic chemist Jeffrey P. Chanton, and toxicologist Henry R. Spiller investigated the site at Delphi using this photograph and other sources as evidence, as part of a United Nations survey of all active faults in Greece.

Jelle Zeilinga de Boer saw evidence of a fault line in Delphi that lay under the ruined temple.
During several expeditions, they discovered two major fault lines, one lying north‚Äìsouth, the Kerna fault, and the other lying east‚Äìwest, the Delphic fault, which parallels the shore of the Corinthian Gulf. The rift of the Gulf of Corinth is one of the most geologically active sites on Earth; shifts there impose immense strains on nearby fault lines, such as those below Delphi. The two faults cross one another, and they intersect right below where the was probably located. (The actual, original oracle chamber had been destroyed by the moving faults, but there is strong structural evidence that indicates where it was most likely located.)

They also found evidence for underground passages and chambers, and drains for spring water. Additionally, they discovered at the site formations of travertine, a form of calcite created when water flows through limestone and dissolves calcium carbonate, which is later redeposited. Further investigation revealed that deep beneath the Delphi region lies a bituminous deposit, rich in hydrocarbons and full of pitch, that has a petrochemical content as high as 20%. Friction created by earthquakes heat the bituminous layers resulting in vaporization of the hydrocarbons which rise to the surface through small fissures in the rock.

=== Illusions in the &quot;&quot; ===
It has been disputed as to how the &quot;adyton&quot; was organized, but it appears clear that this temple was unlike any other in ancient Greece. The small chamber was located below the main floor of the temple and offset to one side, perhaps constructed specifically over the crossing faults. The intimate chamber allowed the escaping vapors to be contained in quarters close enough to provoke intoxicating effects. Plutarch reports that the temple was filled with a sweet smell when the &quot;deity&quot; was present:

De Boer&#x27;s research caused him to propose ethylene as a gas known to possess this sweet odor. Toxicologist Henry R. Spiller stated that inhalation of even a small amount of ethylene can cause both benign trances and euphoric psychedelic experiences. Other effects include physical detachment, loss of inhibitions, the relieving of pain, and rapidly changing moods without dulling consciousness. He also noted that excessive doses can cause confusion, agitation, delirium, and loss of muscle coordination.

Anesthesiologist Isabella Coler Herb found that a dose of ethylene gas up to 20% induced a trance in which subjects could sit up, hear questions and answer them logically, though with altered speech patterns, and they might lose some awareness and sensitivity in their hands and feet. After recovery, they had no recollection of what had happened. With a dose higher than 20%, the patients lost control over their limbs and might thrash wildly, groaning and staggering. All these hallucinogenic symptoms match Plutarch&#x27;s description of the Pythia, whom he had witnessed many times.

During 2001, water samples from the Kerna spring, uphill from the temple and now diverted to the nearby town of Delphi, yielded evidence of 0.3 parts per million of ethylene. It is likely that in ancient times, higher concentrations of ethylene or other gases emerged in the temple from these springs. While likely in the context of the ethylene gas theory, there is no evidence to support the diminishing ethylene concentration statement.

Frequent earthquakes produced by Greece&#x27;s location at the clashing intersection of three tectonic plates could have caused the observed cracking of the limestone, and the opening of new channels for hydrocarbons entering the flowing waters of the Kassotis. This would cause the admixture of ethylene to fluctuate, increasing and decreasing the potency of the drug. It has been suggested that the waning of the Oracle after the era of Roman Emperor Hadrian was due in part to a long period without earthquakes in the area.

<text>A cable modem is a type of network bridge that provides bi-directional data communication via radio frequency channels on a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC), radio frequency over glass (RFoG) and coaxial cable infrastructure. Cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband Internet access in the form of cable Internet, taking advantage of the high bandwidth of a HFC and RFoG network. They are commonly deployed in the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe.

==History==
===MITRE Cablenet===
Internet Experiment Note (IEN) 96 (1979) describes an early RF cable modem system. From pages 2 and 3 of IEN 96:
The Cable-Bus System

The MITRE/Washington Cablenet system is based on a technology developed at MITRE/Bedford. Similar cable-bus systems are in operation at a number of government sites, e.g. Walter Reed Army Hospital, and the NASA Johnson Space Center, but these are all standalone, local-only networks.

The system uses standard community antenna television (CATV) coaxial cable and microprocessor based Bus Interface Units (BIUs) to connect subscriber computers and terminals to the cable. ... The cable bus consists of two parallel coaxial cables, one inbound and the other outbound. The inbound cable and outbound cable are connected at one end, the headend, and electrically terminated at their other ends. This architecture takes advantage of the well developed unidirectional CATV components. The topology is dendritic (i.e. branched like a tree).
The BIUs contain Radio Frequency (RF) modems which modulate a carrier signal to transmit digital information using 1 MHz of the available bandwidth in the 24¬†MHz frequency range. The remainder of the 294¬†MHz bandwidth can be used to carry other communication channels, such as off-the-air TV, FM, closed circuit TV, or a voice telephone system, or, other digital channels. The data rate of our test-bed system is 307.2¬†kbps.

===IEEE 802.3b (10BROAD36)===
The IEEE 802 Committee defined 10BROAD36 in 802.3b-1985 as a IEEE 802.3/Ethernet broadband system to run up to over CATV coax network cabling. The word &quot;broadband&quot; as used in the original IEEE 802.3 specifications implied operation in frequency-division multiplexed (FDM) channel bands as opposed to digital &quot;baseband&quot; square-waveform modulations (also known as line coding), which begin near zero Hz and theoretically consume infinite frequency bandwidth. (In real-world systems, higher-order signal components become indistinguishable from background noise.) In the market 10BROAD36 equipment was not developed by many vendors nor deployed in many user networks as compared to equipment for IEEE 802.3/Ethernet baseband standards such as 10BASE5 (1983), 10BASE2 (1985), 10BASE-T (1990), etc.

===IEEE 802.7===
The IEEE 802 Committee also specified a broadband CATV digital networking standard in 1989 with 802.7-1989. However, like 10BROAD36, 802.7-1989 saw little commercial success.

===Hybrid networks===
Hybrid Networks developed, demonstrated and patented the first high-speed, asymmetrical cable modem system in 1990. A key Hybrid Networks insight was that in the nascent days of the Internet, data downloading constitutes the majority of the data traffic, and this can be served adequately with a highly asymmetrical data network (i.e. a large downstream data pipe and many small upstream data pipes). This allowed CATV operators to offer high-speed data services immediately without first requiring an expensive system upgrade. Also key was that it saw that the upstream and downstream communications could be on the same or different communications media using different protocols working in each direction to establish a closed-loop communications system. The speeds and protocols used in each direction would be very different. The earliest systems used the public switched telephone network (PSTN) for the return path since very few cable systems were bi-directional. Later systems used CATV for the upstream as well as the downstream path. Hybrid&#x27;s system architecture is used for most cable modem systems today.

===LANcity===
LANcity was an early pioneer in cable modems, developing a proprietary system that was widely deployed in the U.S. LANcity, which was led by the Iranian-American engineer Rouzbeh Yassini, was then acquired by Bay Networks. Bay Networks was subsequently acquired by Nortel. Nortel at the time had formed a joint-venture with Antec called ARRIS Interactive. Because of contractual agreements with Antec involving this joint venture, Nortel spun the LANCity group out into the ARRIS Interactive joint-venture. ARRIS continues to make cable modems and cable modem termination system (CMTS) equipment compliant with the DOCSIS standard.

===Zenith homeworks===
Zenith offered a cable modem technology using its own protocol which it introduced in 1993, being one of the first cable modem providers. The Zenith Cable Modem technology was used by several cable television systems in the United States and other countries, including Cox Communications San Diego, Knology in the Southeast United States, Ameritech&#x27;s Americast service (later to be sold off to Wide Open West after the SBC / Ameritech merger), Cogeco in Hamilton Ontario and Cablevision du Nord de Qu√©bec in Val-d&#x27;Or. Zenith Homeworks used BPSK (Bi-Phase Shift Keyed) modulation to achieve 500¬†Kbit/sec in 600¬†kHz, or ec in 6¬†MHz.

===Com21===

Com21 was another early pioneer in cable modems, and quite successful until proprietary systems were made obsolete by the DOCSIS standardization. The Com21 system used a &quot;ComController&quot; as the central bridge in CATV network head-ends, the ComPort cable modem in various models and the NMAPS management system using HP OpenView as the platform. Later they also introduced a return path multiplexer to overcome noise problems when combining return path signals from multiple areas. The proprietary protocol was based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The central ComController switch was a modular system offering one downstream channel (transmitter) and one management module. The remaining slots could be used for upstream receivers (2 per card), dual Ethernet 10BaseT and later also Fast-Ethernet and ATM interfaces. The ATM interface became the most popular, as it supported the increasing bandwidth demands and also supported VLANs.
Com21 developed a DOCSIS modem, but the company filed for bankruptcy in 2003 and closed. The DOCSIS CMTS assets of COM21 were acquired by ARRIS.

===CDLP===
CDLP was a proprietary system manufactured by Motorola. CDLP customer premises equipment (CPE) was capable of both PSTN (telephone network) and radio frequency (cable) return paths. The PSTN-based service was considered &#x27;one-way cable&#x27; and had many of the same drawbacks as satellite Internet service; as a result, it quickly gave way to &quot;two-way cable.&quot; Cable modems that used the RF cable network for the return path were considered &#x27;two-way cable&#x27;, and were better able to compete with the bi-directional digital subscriber line (DSL) service. The standard is in little use now as new providers use, and existing providers having changed to, the DOCSIS standard. The Motorola CDLP proprietary CyberSURFR is an example of a device that was built to the CDLP standard, capable of a peak downstream and upstream. CDLP supported a maximum downstream bandwidth of which could be reached by using several cable modems.

The Australian ISP BigPond employed this system when it started cable modem tests in 1996. For a number of years cable Internet access was only available in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane via CDLP. This network ran parallel to the newer DOCSIS system for several years. In 2004, the CDLP network was terminated and replaced by DOCSIS.

CDLP has been also rolled out at the French cable operator Numericable before upgrading its IP broadband network using DOCSIS.

===DVB/DAVIC===
Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and Digital Audio Visual Council (DAVIC) are European-formed organizations that developed some cable modem standards. However, these standards have not been as widely adopted as DOCSIS.

===IEEE 802.14===
In the mid-1990s the IEEE 802 committee formed a subcommittee (802.14) to develop a standard for cable modem systems. IEEE 802.14 developed a draft standard, which was ATM-based. However, the 802.14 working group was disbanded when North American multi system operators (MSOs) instead backed the then-fledgling DOCSIS 1.0 specification, which generally used best-effort service and was IP-based (with extension codepoints to support ATM for QoS in the future). MSOs were interested in quickly deploying service to compete for broadband Internet access customers instead of waiting on the slower, iterative, and deliberative processes of standards development committees. Albert A. Azzam was Secretary of the IEEE 802.14 Working Group, and his book, &quot;High-Speed Cable Modems&quot;, describes many of the proposals submitted to 802.14.

===IETF===
Although the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) generally does not generate complete cable modem standards, the IETF chartered Working Groups (WGs) that produced various standards related to cable modem technologies (including 802.14, DOCSIS, PacketCable, and others). In particular, the IETF WGs on IP over Cable Data Network (IPCDN) and IP over Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) produced some standards applicable to cable modem systems, primarily in the areas of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Bases (MIBs) for cable modems and other networking equipment that operates over CATV networks.

===DOCSIS===

In the late 1990s, a consortium of US cable operators, known as &quot;MCNS&quot; formed to quickly develop an open and interoperable cable modem specification. The group essentially combined technologies from the two dominant proprietary systems at the time, taking the physical layer from the Motorola CDLP system and the MAC layer from the LANcity system. When the initial specification had been drafted, the MCNS consortium handed over control of it to CableLabs which maintained the specification, promoted it in various standards organizations (notably SCTE and ITU), developed a certification testing program for cable modem equipment, and has since drafted multiple extensions to the original specification.

While deployed DOCSIS RFI 1.0 equipment generally only supported best-effort service, the DOCSIS RFI 1.0 Interim-01 document discussed quality of service (QoS) extensions and mechanisms using IntServ, RSVP, RTP, and Synchronous Transfer Mode (STM) telephony (as opposed to ATM). DOCSIS RFI 1.1 later added more robust and standardized QoS mechanisms to DOCSIS. DOCSIS 2.0 added support for S-CDMA PHY, while DOCSIS 3.0 added IPv6 support and channel bonding to allow a single cable modem to use concurrently more than one upstream channel and more than one downstream channel in parallel.

Virtually all cable modems operating in the field today are compliant with one of the DOCSIS versions. Because of the differences in the European PAL and US&#x27;s NTSC systems two main versions of DOCSIS exist, DOCSIS and EuroDOCSIS. The main differences are found in the width of RF-channels: 6¬†MHz for the US and 8¬†MHz for Europe. A third variant of DOCSIS was developed in Japan and has seen limited deployment in that country.

Although interoperability &quot;was the whole point of the DOCSIS project,&quot; most cable operators only approve a very restricted list of cable modems on their network, identifying the &#x27;allowed&#x27; modems by their brand, models, sometimes firmware version and occasionally going as far as imposing a hardware version of the modem, instead of simply allowing a supported DOCSIS version.

=== Multimedia over Coax Alliance ===
In 2004, the Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) was established to develop industry standard for the connected home, using the existing coaxial cabling. Initially developed for in-home networking with MoCA 1.0/1.1, the MoCA standards has continued to develop with MoCA 2.0/2.1 in 2010 and MoCa 2.5 in 2016.

In 2017, Multimedia over Coax Alliance introduced MoCA Access specification, based on the MoCA 2.5 standard, suitable for addressing broadband network access in-building using coaxial cabling. MoCA Access extends MoCA 2.5 in-home networking to fit operators and ISPs that are installing fiber-to-the-basement/drop point (FTTB/FTTdp) and want to use the existing coax for connection to each apartment or house.&quot;

==Multimedia terminal adapter==
With the development of voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony, analog telephone adapters (ATA) have been incorporated into many cable modems for providing telephone service. An embedded ATA is known as an &quot;embedded multimedia terminal adapter&quot; (E-MTA).

Many cable TV service providers also offer VoIP-based telephone service via the cable infrastructure (PacketCable). Some high-speed Internet customers may use VoIP telephony by subscribing to a third-party service, such as Vonage, MagicJack+ and NetTALK.

==Network architectural functions==
In network topology, a cable modem is a network bridge that conforms to IEEE 802.1D for Ethernet networking (with some modifications). The cable modem bridges Ethernet frames between a customer LAN and the coax network. Technically, it is a modem because it must modulate data to transmit it over the cable network, and it must demodulate data from the cable network to receive it.

It implements an Ethernet PHY on its LAN interface, and a DOCSIS-defined cable-specific PHY on its HFC cable interface. The term &quot;cable modem&quot; refers to this cable-specific PHY. The Network Layer is implemented as an IP host in that it has its own IP address used by the network operator to maintain the device. In the transport layer the cable modem supports UDP in association with its own IP address, and it supports filtering based on TCP and UDP port numbers to, for example, block forwarding of NetBIOS traffic out of the customer&#x27;s LAN. In the Application Layer, the cable modem supports certain protocols that are used for management and maintenance, notably Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), SNMP, and TFTP.

Some cable modems may incorporate a router and a DHCP server to provide the LAN with IP network addressing. From a data forwarding and network topology perspective, this router functionality is typically kept distinct from the cable modem functionality (at least logically) even though the two may share a single enclosure and appear as one unit, sometimes called a residential gateway. So, the cable modem function will have its own IP address and MAC address as will the router.

==Cable modem flap==
Cable modems can have a problem known in industry jargon as &quot;flap&quot; or &quot;flapping&quot;. A modem flap is when the connection by the modem to the head-end has been dropped (gone offline) and then comes back online. The time offline or rate of flap is not typically recorded, only the incidence. While this is a common occurrence and usually unnoticed, if a modem&#x27;s flap is extremely high, these disconnects can cause service to be disrupted. If there are usability problems due to flap the typical cause is a defective modem or very high amounts of traffic on the service provider&#x27;s network (upstream utilization too high). Types of flap include reinsertions, hits and misses, and power adjustments.

== Known vulnerabilities ==
In January 2020, a vulnerability affecting cable modems using Broadcom chipsets was disclosed and named Cable Haunt. Security researchers say that the vulnerability affects hundreds of millions of devices. Exploits are possible because of the use of default credentials in the spectrum analyzer component of the modem (mostly used for debugging purposes) accessible through a network port which is open by default in the vulnerable models.

<text>Kensington is a U.S. town in Montgomery County, Maryland. The population was 2,122 at the 2020 United States census. Greater Kensington encompasses the entire 20895 ZIP code, with a population of 19,753 in 2020.

== History ==

The area around Rock Creek where Kensington is located was primarily agricultural until 1873, when the B&amp;O Railroad completed the Metropolitan Branch across Montgomery County. A community arose where the new railroad line intersected the old Rockville-to-Bladensburg road. This early settlement was first known as &quot;Knowles Station&quot;.

In the early 1890s, Washington developer Brainard Warner began purchasing land parcels to build a planned Victorian community, complete with church, library, and local newspaper. Fascinated by a recent trip to London, Warner named his development &quot;Kensington Park&quot;, the tenth and largest subdivision in the area. When the town was incorporated in 1894, Warner convinced the mayor and council to name it Kensington.

Originally a farming community at Knowles Station, Kensington developed into a summer refuge for Washington residents wishing to escape the capital&#x27;s humidity. As years passed and more residents remained year-round, Kensington evolved into a commuter suburb. Commuters reached downtown Washington, D.C., on B&amp;O passenger trains and, beginning in 1895, a streetcar line founded as Chevy Chase Lake &amp; Kensington Railway and later called the Kensington Railway Company.

The large southernmost section originally mapped out by Warner remains largely unchanged, and is a historically preserved zone. The only major changes in the town&#x27;s basic layout have been the bridging of the original railroad crossing in 1937, and the extension and widening of Connecticut Avenue, the town&#x27;s main thoroughfare, in 1957. As well, the right-of-way of the streetcar line, which was replaced with bus service in 1935, was paved to become Kensington Parkway.

In March 1975, Kensington gained attention regionally when Sheila and Katherine Lyon walked to Wheaton Plaza, a local shopping mall, and never returned home. Their abduction and murder was solved only in 2017.

The historic core of Kensington was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Kensington Historic District in 1980.

In the early 21st century, the town gained national attention three times in 10 months for events within a quarter-mile radius. In December 2001, the town responded to complaints from anonymous citizens by banning Santa Claus from the annual holiday parade. Protesters arrived at the parade en masse, including dozens of Santas riding everything from motorcycles to fire trucks. Eight months later, an Amtrak train derailed near the town center when the tracks separated at an overheated joint, injuring 95. And on October 2, 2002, Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera became the fifth victim of the &quot;Beltway snipers&quot; while cleaning her car at a Kensington gas station.

<doc id="53261" wikidata="Q752719" url="?curid=53261" title="Gaithersburg, Maryland">
<text>Gaithersburg ( ) is a city in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. At the time of the 2020 United States census, Gaithersburg had a population of 69,657, making it the third-largest incorporated city and the ninth-most populous community in the state. Gaithersburg is located to the northwest of Washington, D.C., and is considered a suburb and a primary city within the Washington metropolitan area. Gaithersburg was incorporated as a town in 1878 and as a city in 1968.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is headquartered in Gaithersburg directly west of I-270. Other major employers in the city include IBM, Lockheed Martin Information Systems and Global Services business area headquarters, AstraZeneca. Gaithersburg is also the location of the garrison of the United States Army Reserve Legal Command.

Gaithersburg is noted for its ethnic and economic diversity; it was ranked second for ethnic diversity among the 501 largest U.S. cities, and first among smaller U.S. cities, by WalletHub in 2021. In 2023, Wallethub announced that Gaithersburg was back in the number one spot for diversity in the U.S.

==History==
Gaithersburg was settled in 1765 as a small agricultural settlement known as Log Town near the present day Summit Hall on Ralph Crabb&#x27;s 1725 land grant &quot;Deer Park&quot;. The northern portion of the land grant was purchased by Henry Brookes, and he built his brick home &quot;Montpelier&quot; there, starting first with a log cabin in 1780/3. This 1,000-acre tract became part of the landmark IBM Headquarters complex built on the then-new I-270 Interstate &quot;Industrial&quot;, now &quot;Technology&quot;, Corridor in the late 1960s to the 1970s. Benjamin Gaither married Henry&#x27;s daughter Margaret, and Benjamin and Margaret inherited a portion of Henry&#x27;s land prior to Henry&#x27;s death in 1807. Gaither built his home on the land in 1802. By the 1850s the area had ceased to be called Log Town and was known to inhabitants as Gaithersburg.

===19th century===
The Forest Oak Post Office, named for a large tree in the town, was located in Gaither&#x27;s store in 1851.

On July 10, 1864, using the route of present-day 355, over 10,000 Confederate troops camped overnight in the area, including the present Bohrer Park, after a one-day march from Frederick after the Battle of Monocacy. The next day the troops continued towards Washington in an unsuccessful attempt to take the city.

When the railroad was built through town in 1873, the new station was called Gaithersburg, an officially recognized name for the community for the first time. Also in 1873 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad constructed a station at Gaithersburg, designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin as part of his well-known series of Victorian stations in Maryland. Rapid growth occurred shortly thereafter, and on April 5, 1878, the town was officially incorporated as the Town of Gaithersburg.

Gaithersburg boomed during the late 19th century and churches, schools, a mill, grain elevators, stores, and hotels were built. Much of this development focused around the railroad station.

In 1899, Gaithersburg was selected as one of six global locations for the construction of an International Latitude Observatory as part of a project to measure the Earth&#x27;s wobble on its polar axis. The Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory is (as of 2007) the only National Historic Landmark in the City of Gaithersburg. The observatory and five others in Japan, Italy, Russia, and the United States gathered information that is still used by scientists today, along with information from satellites, to determine polar motion; the size, shape, and physical properties of the earth; and to aid the space program through the precise navigational patterns of orbiting satellites. The Gaithersburg station operated until 1982 when computerization rendered the manual observation obsolete.

===Late 20th century===
In 1968, Gaithersburg was upgraded from a town to a city.

Gaithersburg remained a predominantly rural farm town until the 1970s when more construction began. As the population grew, with homes spreading throughout the area, Gaithersburg began taking on a suburban and semi-urban feel, leaving its farming roots behind. During the late 1990s and 2000s, it had become one of the most economically and ethnically diverse areas in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area as well as the State of Maryland, with people from all walks of life calling Gaithersburg home. This can be seen in the local schools, with Gaithersburg High School and Watkins Mill High School having two of the most diverse student bodies in the region.

During a 1997 rainstorm, the 295-year-old forest oak tree that gave its name to the Forest Oak Post Office crashed down. The tree served as the inspiration for the city&#x27;s logo, which is also featured prominently on the city&#x27;s flag.

===21st century===
In 2007, parts of the film &quot;Body of Lies&quot; were filmed in the city, at a building on 100 Edison Park Drive. The film was released in 2008 and the building is now the Montgomery County Police Department&#x27;s headquarters.

<text>In mathematics, the convolution theorem states that under suitable conditions the Fourier transform of a convolution of two functions (or signals) is the product of their Fourier transforms. More generally, convolution in one domain (e.g., time domain) equals point-wise multiplication in the other domain (e.g., frequency domain). Other versions of the convolution theorem are applicable to various Fourier-related transforms.

Consider two functions formula_1 and formula_2 with Fourier transforms formula_3 and formula_4:

:formula_5

where formula_6 denotes the Fourier transform operator. The transform may be normalized in other ways, in which case constant scaling factors (typically formula_7 or formula_8) will appear in the convolution theorem below. The convolution of formula_9 and formula_10 is defined by:

:formula_11

In this context the asterisk denotes convolution, instead of standard multiplication. The tensor product symbol formula_12 is sometimes used instead.

The convolution theorem states that:

Applying the inverse Fourier transform formula_13 produces the corollary:

The theorem also generally applies to multi-dimensional functions.
Consider functions formula_14 in L&quot;p&quot;-space formula_15 with Fourier transforms formula_16:

:formula_17

where formula_18 indicates the inner product of formula_19: ¬† formula_20 ¬† and ¬† formula_21

The convolution of formula_9 and formula_10 is defined by:

:formula_24

Also:

:formula_25

Hence by Fubini&#x27;s theorem we have that formula_26 so its Fourier transform formula_27 is defined by the integral formula:

:formula_28

Note that formula_29¬† Hence by the argument above we may apply Fubini&#x27;s theorem again (i.e. interchange the order of integration):

:formula_30
This theorem also holds for the Laplace transform, the two-sided Laplace transform and, when suitably modified, for the Mellin transform and Hartley transform (see Mellin inversion theorem). It can be extended to the Fourier transform of abstract harmonic analysis defined over locally compact abelian groups.

=== Periodic convolution (Fourier series coefficients) ===

Consider formula_31-periodic functions formula_32 ¬† and ¬† formula_33 which can be expressed as periodic summations:

:formula_34 ¬† and ¬† formula_35

In practice the non-zero portion of components formula_9 and formula_10 are often limited to duration formula_38 but nothing in the theorem requires that.

The Fourier series coefficients are:

:formula_39

where formula_6 denotes the Fourier series integral.

* The product: formula_41 is also formula_31-periodic, and its Fourier series coefficients are given by the discrete convolution of the formula_3 and formula_4 sequences:

:formula_45

*The convolution:

:formula_46

is also formula_31-periodic, and is called a periodic convolution.
:formula_48
The corresponding convolution theorem is:

&lt;!-- \, d\tau\\
&amp;=\underbrace{\left(\int_P\ u_{_P}(\tau)\ e^{-i 2\pi k \tau/P} d\tau\right)}_{P\cdot U[k]}\ V[k].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
== Functions of a discrete variable (sequences) ==

By a derivation similar to Eq.1, there is an analogous theorem for sequences, such as samples of two continuous functions, where now formula_6 denotes the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) operator. Consider two sequences formula_50 and formula_51 with transforms formula_3 and formula_4:

:formula_54

The of formula_9 and formula_10 is defined by:

:formula_57

The convolution theorem for discrete sequences is:

=== Periodic convolution ===
formula_58 and formula_59 as defined above, are periodic, with a period of 1. Consider formula_60-periodic sequences formula_61 and formula_62:

:formula_63 ¬† and ¬† formula_64

These functions occur as the result of sampling formula_3 and formula_4 at intervals of formula_67 and performing an inverse discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on formula_60 samples (see ). The discrete convolution:

:formula_69

is also formula_60-periodic, and is called a periodic convolution. Redefining the formula_6 operator as the formula_60-length DFT, the corresponding theorem is:

And therefore:

Under the right conditions, it is possible for this formula_60-length sequence to contain a distortion-free segment of a formula_74 convolution. But when the non-zero portion of the formula_75 or formula_76 sequence is equal or longer than formula_77 some distortion is inevitable.¬† Such is the case when the formula_78 sequence is obtained by directly sampling the DTFT of the infinitely long impulse response.

For formula_9 and formula_10 sequences whose non-zero duration is less than or equal to formula_77 a final simplification is:
This form is often used to efficiently implement numerical convolution by computer. (see and )

As a partial reciprocal, it has been shown 
that any linear transform that turns convolution into a product is the DFT (up to a permutation of coefficients).
A time-domain derivation proceeds as follows:

:formula_82

A frequency-domain derivation follows from , which indicates that the DTFTs can be written as:

:formula_83

:formula_84

The product with formula_85 is thereby reduced to a discrete-frequency function:

:formula_86

where the equivalence of formula_78 and formula_88 follows from . Therefore, the equivalence of (5a) and (5b) requires:

:formula_89

&lt;br&gt;We can also verify the inverse DTFT of (5b):

:formula_90
==Convolution theorem for inverse Fourier transform==
There is also a convolution theorem for the inverse Fourier transform:

Here, &quot;formula_91&quot; represents the Hadamard product, and &quot;formula_92&quot; represents a convolution between the two matrices.

:formula_93

so that

:formula_94

==Convolution theorem for tempered distributions==

The convolution theorem extends to tempered distributions. 
Here, formula_10 is an arbitrary tempered distribution:

:formula_96

But formula_97 must be &quot;rapidly decreasing&quot; towards formula_98 and formula_99 in order to guarantee the existence of both, convolution and multiplication product. Equivalently, if formula_100 is a smooth &quot;slowly growing&quot; ordinary function, it guarantees the existence of both, multiplication and convolution product.

In particular, every compactly supported tempered distribution, such as the Dirac delta, is &quot;rapidly decreasing&quot;. Equivalently, bandlimited functions, such as the function that is constantly formula_101 are smooth &quot;slowly growing&quot; ordinary functions. If, for example, formula_102 is the Dirac comb both equations yield the Poisson summation formula and if, furthermore, formula_103 is the Dirac delta then formula_104 is constantly one and these equations yield the Dirac comb identity.

<doc id="53269" wikidata="Q161348" url="?curid=53269" title="Ramstein Air Base">
<text>Ramstein Air Base is a United States Air Force installation located in Rhineland-Palatinate, southwestern Germany. It serves as the headquarters for the United States Air Forces in Europe ‚Äì Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) and NATO Allied Air Command (AIRCOM). The base plays a key role in supporting forward military operations, particularly those deploying to Eastern Europe and Africa.

Constructed between 1949 and 1952 by the French Army and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Ramstein Air Base is part of the larger Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC), which houses around 54,000 American service members and over 5,400 U.S. civilian employees. Additionally, more than 6,200 German workers are employed within the KMC. Air Force units in the KMC employ nearly 9,800 military personnel, supported by approximately 11,100 family members.

Ramstein AB alone hosts over 16,200 military personnel, U.S. civilians, and contractors. The base is located near the town of Ramstein-Miesenbach, with the east gate about from Kaiserslautern, commonly known as &quot;K-Town&quot; among Americans. Other nearby towns include Landstuhl, located from the base&#x27;s west gate.

==History==

===Development and establishment===
In 1940, construction of today&#x27;s was stopped when a bridge that was being built across the Rhine River near Mannheim collapsed, leaving a section of autobahn that could not be used. A part of the unused autobahn to the west of Mannheim, near Kaiserslautern, was used as an airstrip by the Luftwaffe. The airstrip was also used by the advancing U.S. Army Air Forces during the final months of World WarII. The old autobahn section is still used as the access road to the east and west gates of the base and the A6 was rebuilt south of the air base after the war.

During the initial postwar era, the USAAF repaired several former Luftwaffe airfields in Bavaria, part of the American occupation zone of Germany.

The area was a swamp that had to be built up by . A train line was laid out from in a yoke shape around to the current base and back down to the Landstuhl spur in 1948, by agreement of the U.S. and French Occupational Forces. Trainloads of earth were moved over the line and spread over the base&#x27;s current area to raise it to its current level. Once the ground was level, construction work began. Two bases were laid out. Landstuhl Air Base on the south side and Ramstein Air Station (station, no airstrip) on the north. From 1948 to the opening of the bases in 1953, it was the largest one spot construction site in Europe employing over 270,000 workers at one time.

Enough construction was completed in mid-1952 that LandstuhlAB was opened on 5 August. Its facilities included a runway, dispersal hardstands, a control tower, ramps, and other flight-related facilities and the associated flying and support units. On , Det1, 86th Fighter-Bomber Wing arrived at LandstuhlAB from Neubiberg Air Base near Munich.

On , Ramstein Air Station was opened. Ramstein was the location of headquarters, Twelfth Air Force, and supported family housing, base exchange, commissary, dependents&#x27; schools and other administrative offices for the WAFs (Women&#x27;s Air Force). The barracks that were built at Ramstein AS were used to house WAFs and single women that worked as U.S. Government employees at both RamsteinAS and LandstuhlAB. On , Headquarters, Twelfth Air Force was activated on Ramstein Air Base, having moved from its joint facilities with HQ USAFE at Wiesbaden AB. What was not generally known at the time and not made public until after the end of the Cold War in 1993, was the desire to have HQTwelfth Air Force in close proximity to the Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC)Kindsbach, &#x27;Kindsbach Cave&#x27;the site of NATO&#x27;s underground combat operations center.

===Operational history===
The 86th Air Base Group was activated as the main base support unit for Landstuhl while the 7030th HQ Support Group was the main base support unit for Ramstein. On , the two bases were consolidated into the largest NATO-controlled air base in service on the continent. It was called &quot;Ramstein‚ÄìLandstuhl Air Base&quot;, but later, after the West German government continued construction of the A6 autobahn from Kaiserslautern to Saarbr√ºcken, the autobahn cut off access at the south of the base which is where the main gate was in the city limit of Landstuhl. The main gate was moved to the west side of the base which was in the town of Ramstein. The two bases were joined and the current Kisling Memorial Drive cut off to the public which made one base. In 1961, the base was officially named &quot;Ramstein Air Base.&quot;

One legacy of the two separate air bases is that the north side of Ramstein retained a separate APO from the south side. The north side (Ramstein AB) is APOAE09012, while the south side (LandstuhlAB) is APOAE09009. Also separate Combat Support Groups, the 7030th for the north side, and the 86th for the south side existed. These were consolidated in the 1980s, and the two Combat Support units were merged into the 377th Combat Support Wing. There is still a north and south side Fitness Centers. The current northside Community Center before housed the WAF NCO Club. As well, there were two Movie Theaters on the North side and two on the South side. Currently, only two still stand on the north side: a remodeled Nightingale Theater (known before as the Four Corners Theater) on the corner across from the Base gas Station, and the north side AAFES dry cleaners that was known as the Ramstein Rocket Theater.

Near the Ramstein Air Base is the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC), operated by the United States Army. Although part of the Kaiserslautern Military Community, LRMC has a separate history and was never a part of Ramstein or Landstuhl Air Bases, although both facilities have utilized the medical facilities at LRMC, since they were established in 1953. Currently there are plans on the drawing board from the U.S. Department of Defense to build a new Medical Center on the current U.S. Army Weilerbach Storage Installation just to the east of RamsteinAB. Construction is to be completed in and around 2024. It will be a twelve-story facility to house all departments of LRMC and the current Ramstein AB Clinic along with Dental Clinic facilities for the whole KMC. In turn, the East Gate to RamsteinAB will be extended from its current location to just off the Autobahn 6 Einsiedlerhof exit to the base at what is known as the Elvis Gate.

From 2004 to 2006, Ramstein Air Base underwent an extensive expansion with a major construction project ‚Äì including an all-new airport terminal, among other new facilities, through the so-called Rhein-Main Transition Program which was initiated in support of the total closure of Rhein-Main Air Base on and transferring all its former capacities to Ramstein Air Base (70%) and Spangdahlem Air Base (30%).

Ramstein served as temporary housing for the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team during the 2006World Cup.

=== Operational history ===

==== 86th Wing ====


Reassigned from Neubiberg Air Base, West Germany in 1952 and except for a period between 1968 and 1973, the 86th Wing, under various designations, has been the main operational and host unit at Ramstein Air Base.

Throughout the 1950s, the 86th was primarily a Fighter-Bomber Wing. In 1960, it was realigned to an air defense mission and became the 86th Air Division (Defense). The 86th AD was inactivated in 1968. Returning as an F-4 Phantom II Tactical Fighter Wing in 1973, the 86th TFW performed that mission until 1994, deploying components to the Middle East during the 1990 Gulf War.

On , the Strategic Air Command 306th Strategic Wing was activated at Ramstein with a KC-135 air refueling and an RC-135 reconnaissance mission. The 306th also functioned as the focal point for all SAC operations in Europe and as liaison between SAC and USAFE. The wing moved to RAF Mildenhall, England on .

In June 1985, the 316th Air Division was activated, centralizing command authority at Ramstein. The 86 TFW became the division&#x27;s flight operations arm, while the newly formed 377th Combat Support Wing, also activated in 1985, became responsible for the logistical and administrative support on base, replacing the 86th and 7030 Combat Support Wings. On , Ramstein Air Base was the site of the tragic Ramstein airshow disaster, which killed 72 spectators and three pilots, and injured hundreds.

After the Cold War, the 86th was realigned to become the 86th Airlift Wing. On , the 55th Aeromedical Airlift Squadron moved from the 435thAW at Rhein-Main Air Base Germany to Ramstein. On 1 October, the 75th and 76th Airlift Squadron arrived at Ramstein from the 60th AW at Travis Air Force Base California, and 437thAW at Charleston AFB South Carolina, respectively. A year later on , the 37thAirlift Squadron was transferred to Ramstein from Rhein-Main.

In 1999, the activation of the 86th Contingency Response Group brought the airfield and aerial port operations and provision of force protection at contingency airfields mission to the wing.

On , the 38th Combat Support Wing was activated to enhance support to USAFE geographically separated units. This wing was inactivated in 2007. The 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing was activated on . The wing is the headquarters for the existing 721st Air Mobility Operations Group at Ramstein and the 521st AMOG at Naval Station Rota, Spain. The 521st AMOW provides an enhanced level of control for the AMC route structure in Europe, which includes critical locations for getting people, cargo and patients to and from current war zones.

By 1984, the Kindsbach Cave had become too small and its cost for renovation too high. The USAFE vacated the facility and, on , control was returned to the German government and the German government returned the facility to the original owner of the land. Today, the Kindsbach Cave is private property, through tours of the cave can be arranged. The cave is overgrown by vegetation, trees, and new housing.

The new 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing stood up on . , the commander of the 521st AMOW is Colonel Adrienne Williams.

In December 2023 a new Space Force component stands up at Ramstein Air Base.

==== 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing ====

On , French President Charles de Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATO&#x27;s integrated military structure. The United States was informed that it must remove its military forces from France by .

As a result, the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, based at Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France, and two of its squadrons, the 38th and 32d, equipped with the RF-4C Phantom II, were relocated to Ramstein on .

Assigned squadrons of the 26th TRW at Ramstein were:
* 38th Tactical Reconnaissance (RF-4C, Tail Code: RR)
* 526th Fighter Interceptor/Tactical Fighter (F-102/F-4E (1970) Tail Code: RS)
* 7th Special Operation (C-130, C-47, UH-1)

While at Ramstein, the 26th TRW acquired a number of other units with different flying missions. One function gained by the 26 TRW, almost immediately after arriving at Ramstein, was the maintenance and flying of the HQ USAFE liaison aircraft. In addition, the Wing was responsible for flying members of the HQ USAFE staff to Air Force and NATO bases throughout Europe. In addition, the 26th TRW was only designated as a flight, because of its small size. It consisted of a mixture of aircraft, including: T-29s, T-33s, T-39s, C-54s, O-2s, H-19s, and UH-1s.

In 1971 a detachment of the 630th Military Airlift Support Squadron from Rhein-Main Air Base was assigned to Ramstein and a large cargo aerial port constructed. This allowed Military Airlift Command C-141 and C-5 Galaxy aircraft to use Ramstein as a transshipment point for material, which was then moved within USAFE by C-130 tactical transports.

In the spring of 1972, the 7th Special Operations Squadron (SOS) was assigned flying C-130Es, C-47As, and UH-1Ns. Because of the special operations mission of the 7 SOS, it reported directly to HQ USAFE for operational control.

As part of operation &quot;Creek Action&quot;, a command-wide effort to realign functions and streamline operations, HQ USAFE transferred the 26th TRW from Ramstein to Zweibr√ºcken Air Base and the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing was reassigned from Zweibr√ºcken to Ramstein on .

=== NATO command center ===
From its inception, Ramstein was designed as a NATO command base. In 1957, Ramstein provided support for NATO&#x27;s HQ Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force, which moved to Ramstein from Trier Air Base on upon the closure of that facility. Also on that date, HQ Twelfth Air Force was transferred to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas, and was assigned to Tactical Air Command. It was replaced by HQ Seventeenth Air Force (USAFE) which was moved from North Africa. In turn, the 17th AF was replaced by its mother unit HQ USAFE from Lindsey Air Station, Wiesbaden, West Germany in 1973. The HQ 17th AF was moved to Sembach AB at that time and controlled all USAF Air Divisions and Wings north of the Alps, with the exception of the British Isles and Scandinavia, which were controlled by HQ 3rd AF at Mildenhall.

On , several headquarters were relocated into and out of Ramstein, when SeventeenthAF moved to Sembach Air Base to make room for the expected move of HQUSAFE to Ramstein. This entire operation, code-named &quot;Creek Action&quot;, was carried out as part of the USAF&#x27;s new worldwide policy of locating the most vital headquarters in thinly populated rural areas rather than near cities. Later, HQ USAFE was moved, due to the fact that US Intelligence found that the Soviets had plans to invade Western Europe through the Fulda Gap in West Germany. The military thought to move vital HQs on the other side of the Rhein River for protection.

As a result of this policy change, Ramstein air base became a large multi-national NATO center: in addition to the USAFE&#x27;s headquarters, it also housed the new NATO headquarters of the Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE).

The AAFCE also commanded the 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force (2ATAF) and the 4th ATAF. The 4th ATAF, which had been headquartered at Ramstein for many years, included the 1st Canadian Air Group, 1st and 2nd Divisions of the West German Air Force, and units of the USAFE&#x27;s 3rd and 17th Air Force. HQ USAFE fully completed its move from Wiesbaden to Ramstein in early 1991.

With USAFE&#x27;s arrival in 1973, Ramstein entered a period of expansion. The duel commander of the 316th AD / 86 TFW became host commander of Americans living in the Kaiserslautern Military Community instead of the US Army 21st Commanding General. The Wiesbaden USAF Community was then traded to the US Army Control as for an even Kaiserlautern switch. The KMC from the 1950s to the early 1990s had an average population of Americans of 110,000, outnumbering those Germans in the City of Kaiserslautern for that period.
Allied Air Forces Central Europe was established at Ramstein on . Ramstein subsequently provided support for other headquarters including the 322nd Airlift Division that arrived on , and SAC&#x27;s 7th Air Division that arrived on . In December 1980, HQ Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force was moved from Ramstein to Heidelberg and co-located with HQ Central Army Group.

In 1984, an enlisted airman (Sgt Darrel Dietlein), assigned to the 1964th Communications Group, solicited National Headquarters Civil Air Patrol to charter the first &quot;Cadet Squadron&quot; in West Germany, naming the unit &quot;Ramstein Cadet Squadron&quot; and becoming the unit&#x27;s first commander as a CAP First Lieutenant. The Ramstein Cadet Squadron was formed with Captain Mark Bailey serving as the unit&#x27;s first liaison officer, as well as other like minded military volunteers and roughly six cadets. To this day, the squadron enjoys vibrant member participation, as well as base support, hosting the European Encampments along with their traditional military studies, cadet programs and aerospace education efforts. The Ramstein Cadet Squadron commander is 1st Lt Cody Chenowith. The squadron is the central hub for all CAP units in Europe. Membership was 55 members. In the subsequent years, a companion cadet squadron was formed at Spangdahlem Air Base. Distance learning cadets are located at SHAPE, Belgium and Hohenfels, Germany. Additionally, the Ramstein Cadet Squadron is the second oldest and continuous operating unit on the installation and even predating the 86th Air Wing.

Today, the base is home to the Allied Air Command, which is responsible to Joint Force Command Brunssum, the only and main NATO command unit on Ramstein AB.

=== ADOC Kindsbach ===

Close to Ramstein was the site of Air Defense Operations Center (ADOC)Kindsbach, AKA &#x27;Kindsbach Cave&#x27; ‚Äì the site of Europe&#x27;s underground combat operations center.

The facility was located in a former German western front command headquarters. The French took control of the underground bunker after World War II, and USAFE assumed control in 1953. After major renovations, USAFE opened the center on .

The center was a state-of-the-art, 67-room, facility where USAFE could have led an air war against the Soviet Union. The center had a digital computer to work out bombing problems, cryptographic equipment for coded message traffic and its own photo lab to develop reconnaissance photos. Responsible for an air space extending deep behind the Iron Curtain, the center interacted directly with The Pentagon, NATO, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and all USAFE bases. With its massive telephone switchboard and 80 teletype machines, the cave was plugged into everything in the outside world. The center was receiving more than 1,000 calls a day.

As a further measure of protection, the cave was fully self-contained with its own water supply, electric backup-generators, climate controls, dining facilities and sleeping accommodations for its 125-man crew. Visitor passes were rarely issued to this secret facility.

Throughout the years, leadership changed but USAFE led the operations through numbered Air Forces. The center&#x27;s commander was the USAFE Advanced Echelon. The glassed-in office was on the top floor of the three-story underground command center. Directly under the office was the management for offensive air operations. And the bottom floor office was the management for defensive air operations ‚Äì to include support for U.S. Army forces and West German Civil Defense. All three offices had a full view of the massive Air Operations Center map on the opposing wall.

The AOC was the largest room in the complex. Its three-story map was used to plot minute-by-minute movements of friendly and unidentified aircraft. But the center was much more than just a tracking station, because it could also react to threats. They always knew the current operational status of air weapons in theater including missiles, and could dispatch armed response &quot;at a moment&#x27;s notice&quot;.

By the early 1960s, the manual plotting system used to track aircraft at the cave and elsewhere throughout West Germany was too slow and inaccurate for the quick responses necessary. Beginning in 1962, airmen trained in the new 412L air weapons control system began to arrive in Germany and at the cave. Over the next year, the new GE semi-automatic system was installed. When complete at the cave, the current air picture over East and West Germanies, as well as parts of the eastern Soviet bloc countries, was displayed on a screen with radar information provided by various 412L sites located throughout West Germany. Senior U.S. staff monitored the dynamic display 24/7. Over the next several years, additional 412L sites throughout Germany joined the network, until the manual system had been totally replaced.

=== Drone war control center ===
In April 2015, Ramstein Air Base was reported by German and international media as an important control center in the drone war staged under the Obama administration against targets in areas like Pakistan, Yemen, Afghanistan and Somalia. The German government claimed not to have been informed about this function of the U.S. base.

In a TV and online documentary, the German Das Erste channel cited 2014 reports from Norddeutscher Rundfunk, WDR, and the that revealed Ramstein to be an important hub in the drone war against terror suspects. New data, provided by Edward Snowden affiliate Glenn Greenwald, supported these reports with classified documents from inside the U.S. administration and were also presented in the Citizenfour video documentary. The revelation of US drone activities from Ramstein lead to nationwide anti-drone protests under the banner of &quot;Stop Ramstein Air Base&quot;.

In 2019, three Yemenis who lost relatives in a 2012 US drone strike took legal action against the German government for aiding the breaking of international law by the United States, by tolerating these operations from Ramstein. The German Higher Administrative Court in M√ºnster ruled that the German government must take appropriate measures to control whether the US army follows international law at Ramstein Air Base. However, the possibilities of Germany to control US activities on their territory are very limited as the United States have jurisdiction over Ramstein Air Base.

=== Illegal arms and munition transports ===
In 2015, the Serbian newspaper reported about Ramstein Air Base being used by the United States Armed Forces to transport arms and munitions to Syria. At the end of 2017, an anonymous U.S. official stated that the U.S. does, indeed, use Ramstein Air Base to supplement Syrian rebels with arms and munition. The German Federal Government stated that it did not grant the necessary permits for these transports, nor that it had been informed about them. The Kaiserslautern public prosecutor&#x27;s office did not initiate any official investigations. She checked generally accessible sources, on which some of the press articles mentioned were based, and obtained information from the authorities involved in monitoring foreign trade. According to the review, there was &quot;no evidence of concrete arms transports to Syria via Ramstein&quot;. However, the journalistic conclusion cannot be ruled out, according to the prosecution authority. Previous investigations of the Ramstein Air Base, such as the Abu Omar case, have proven to be unsuccessful. If the investigations into the arms and ammunition transports had been successful, this would have constituted a violation of the German Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz (War Weapons Control Act) and the Foreign Trade and Payments Act.

=== Afghanistan Evacuation ===

In late Summer 2021, Ramstein Air Base became the transfer point for thousands of Afghan civilians fleeing Afghanistan following the fall of Kabul back into Taliban hands as U.S. and NATO forces withdrew from the country. Civilian airlines under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, such as Delta, American, Eastern, and United were allowed to land at Ramstein and serve as flights to take Afghan families and other supporters of the U.S. and NATO forces to new lives in the United States. Those who had to stay on the base were cared for in makeshift living centers which were set up to tend to their needs until they could be processed and flown to the United States. 

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===

On , Ramstein Air Base hosted a meeting of the International Advisory Group on Ukraine&#x27;s Defense and Counteraction to Russia, convened by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to synchronize and coordinate Ukraine&#x27;s military assistance in the war with Russia. The event was attended by heads of defense agencies of 42 countries. The meeting was attended by Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksii Reznikov.

The participating countries agreed on financial assistance to Ukraine and the supply of &quot;heavy&quot; weapons. They also allowed Ukraine to strike at Russian strategic sites with Western weapons. The next meetings are planned to be held monthly.

An RAAF E-7A Wedgetail is based at Ramstein from October 2023, for a six-month deployment to supplement NATO AEW&amp;C.

== Facilities ==

=== Airfield ===
Ramstein Air Base consists of two runways09/27 and 08/26two large aprons, one near a hangar north of Runways 27 and 26, and one to the north of 09 and 08. The north-western apron also has a small passenger terminal with two jetways. This means the air base is capable of joint-use operations, although currently there are no scheduled airlines running flights to and from Ramstein.

=== Schools ===
There are four schools at Ramstein Air Base: Ramstein Elementary School (grades PreK‚Äì2), Ramstein Intermediate School (grades 3‚Äì5), Ramstein American Middle School (grades 6‚Äì8), and Ramstein High School (grades 9‚Äì12). All of these schools are run by DoDDS, a component of DoDEA.

==Role and operations==


The host unit is the 86th Airlift Wing (86AW), commanded by Brigadier General Otis C. Jones. The 86th Airlift Wing is composed of six groups, 30 squadrons and four bases in Germany, Spain, the Azores, and Belgium. Its mission is the operation and maintenance of airlift assets consisting of C-130Js, C-21s, and C-37A Gulfstream aircraft throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

Also at Ramstein is the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing (formerly the 435th Air Base Wing) (435AGOW), which focuses on base-support responsibilities within the KMC. It is composed of five groups and 20 squadrons. The wing provides rapid mobility and agile combat support for military operations, and maintains expeditionary forces and infrastructure.

, the commander of the 435th AGOW is Colonel Bryan T. Callahan.

Ramstein&#x27;s wings are assigned to the headquarters 3rd Air Force also based at RamsteinAB that controls most of the USAF Wings throughout Europe.

There is often a Summer Camp to Ramstein from British CCF (RAF) and ATC cadets, as well as Civil Air Patrol encampments and tours like the ones held in July 2015 and June 2016.
