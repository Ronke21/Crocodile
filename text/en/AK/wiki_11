<text>Audrey Kathleen Hepburn ( Ruston; 4 May 1929 – 20 January 1993) was a British actress. Recognised as a film and fashion icon, she was ranked by the American Film Institute as the third-greatest female screen legend from the Classical Hollywood cinema and was inducted into the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List.

Born into an aristocratic family in Ixelles, Brussels, Hepburn spent parts of her childhood in Belgium, England and the Netherlands. She attended boarding school in Kent from 1936 to 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, she returned to the Netherlands. During the war, Hepburn studied ballet at the Arnhem Conservatory, and by 1944 she was performing ballet to raise money to support the Dutch resistance. She studied ballet with Sonia Gaskell in Amsterdam beginning in 1945 and with Marie Rambert in London from 1948.

Hepburn began performing as a chorus girl in West End musical theatre productions and then had minor appearances in several films. She rose to stardom in the romantic comedy &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953) alongside Gregory Peck, for which she became the first actress to win an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Award for a single performance. In that year, she also won a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Play for her performance in &quot;Ondine&quot;. Hepburn went on to star in a number of successful films, such as &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954), with Humphrey Bogart and William Holden; &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957), a musical in which she sang her own parts; the drama &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; (1959); the romantic comedy &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961); the thriller-romance &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), opposite Cary Grant; and the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964). In 1967, she starred in the thriller &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot;, receiving Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations. After that role, Hepburn only occasionally appeared in films, one being &quot;Robin and Marian&quot; (1976) with Sean Connery. Her last recorded performances were in the 1990 documentary television series &quot;Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn&quot;, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement – Informational Programming. In 1994, Hepburn&#x27;s contributions to a spoken-word recording titled &quot;Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s Enchanted Tales&quot; earned her a posthumous Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children. She is one of few entertainers who have won competitive Academy, Emmy, Grammy and Tony Awards. Hepburn won three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. In recognition of her film career, she received BAFTA&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award and the Special Tony Award.

Later in life, Hepburn devoted much of her time to UNICEF, to which she had contributed since 1954. Between 1988 and 1992, she worked in some of the poorest communities of Africa, South America and Asia. In December 1992, Hepburn received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. A month later, she died of appendix cancer at her home in Tolochenaz, Vaud, Switzerland, at the age of 63.

==Early life==
===1929–1938: Family and early childhood===
Audrey Kathleen Ruston (later, Hepburn-Ruston) was born on 4 May 1929 at number 48 Rue Keyenveld in Ixelles, a municipality of Brussels, Belgium. She was known to her family as &quot;Adriaantje&quot;.

Hepburn&#x27;s mother, Baroness Ella van Heemstra (1900–1984), was a Dutch noblewoman. Ella was the daughter of Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra, who served as the mayor of Arnhem from 1910 to 1920 and as the governor of Dutch Guiana from 1921 to 1928, and Baroness Elbrig Willemine Henriette van Asbeck (1873–1939), a granddaughter of Count Dirk van Hogendorp. At age 19, she married Jonkheer Hendrik Gustaaf Adolf Quarles van Ufford – an oil executive based in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, where the couple subsequently lived. Before divorcing in 1925, they had two sons, Jonkheer Arnoud Robert Alexander Quarles van Ufford (1920–1979) and Jonkheer Ian Edgar Bruce Quarles van Ufford (1924–2010).

Hepburn&#x27;s father, Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston (1889–1980), was a British subject born in Auschitz, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary. He was the son of Victor John George Ruston, who was of British and German-Austrian background, and Anna Juliana Franziska Karolina Wels, who was of German-Austrian origin and born in Kovarce. In 1923–1924, he was an Honorary British Consul in Semarang, Dutch East Indies and, prior to his marriage to Hepburn&#x27;s mother, was married to Cornelia Bisschop, a Dutch heiress. Joseph later changed his surname to the more &quot;aristocratic&quot; double-barrelled Hepburn-Ruston, perhaps at Ella&#x27;s insistence, as he mistakenly believed himself descended from James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell.

Hepburn&#x27;s parents were married in Batavia in 1926. At the time, Joseph worked for a trading company, but soon after the marriage, the couple moved to Europe, where he began working for a loan company; reportedly tin merchants MacLaine, Watson, and Company in London. After a year in London, they moved to Brussels, where he had been assigned to open a branch office. After three years spent traveling between Brussels, Arnhem, The Hague and London, the family settled in the suburban Brussels municipality of Linkebeek in 1932. Hepburn&#x27;s early childhood was sheltered and privileged. Due to her father&#x27;s job, the family travelled back and forth between three countries, enhancing her multinational background.

In the mid-1930s, Hepburn&#x27;s parents recruited and collected donations for the British Union of Fascists (B.U.F). Ella met Adolf Hitler and wrote favourable articles about him for the B.U.F. Joseph left the family abruptly in 1935 after a &quot;scene&quot; in Brussels. He subsequently moved to London, where he became more deeply involved in the Fascist activity and never visited Hepburn abroad. That same year, Ella moved to her family&#x27;s estate in Arnhem with her daughter; her sons, Alex and Ian, were sent to The Hague to live with relatives. Joseph wanted Hepburn to be educated in the United Kingdom, so in 1937, she was sent to live in Kent, where she, known as Audrey Ruston or &quot;Little Audrey&quot;, was educated at a small private school in Elham. Her parents officially divorced the next year. Later in her life, she often spoke of the effect on a child of being &quot;dumped&quot; as &quot;children need two parents&quot;; she professed that her father&#x27;s departure was &quot;the most traumatic event of my life&quot;. In the 1960s, Hepburn renewed contact with her father after locating him in Dublin through the Red Cross; she supported him financially until his death although he remained emotionally detached.

===1939–1945: Experiences during World War II===

After Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Hepburn&#x27;s mother moved her daughter back to Arnhem in the hope that, as during the First World War, the Netherlands would remain neutral and be spared a German attack. While there, Hepburn attended the Arnhem Conservatory from 1939 to 1945. She had begun taking ballet lessons during her last years at boarding school, and continued training in Arnhem under the tutelage of Winja Marova, becoming her &quot;star pupil&quot;. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Hepburn used the name Edda van Heemstra, because an &quot;English-sounding&quot; name was considered dangerous during the German occupation. Her family was profoundly affected by the occupation, with Hepburn later stating that &quot;had we known that we were going to be occupied for five years, we might have all shot ourselves. We thought it might be over next week… six months… next year… that&#x27;s how we got through&quot;.

In 1942, her uncle, Otto van Limburg Stirum (husband of her mother&#x27;s older sister, Miesje), was executed in retaliation for an act of sabotage by the resistance movement; while he had not been involved in the act, he was targeted due to his family&#x27;s prominence in Dutch society. These family events were the turning point in the attitude of Hepburn&#x27;s mother, who had flirted with Nazism up to this point. Hepburn&#x27;s half-brother Ian was deported to Berlin to work in a German labour camp, and her other half-brother Alex went into hiding to avoid the same fate.

After her uncle&#x27;s death, Hepburn, Ella, and Miesje left Arnhem to live with her grandfather, Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra, in nearby Velp. Around that time Hepburn gave silent dance performances that reportedly raised money for the Dutch resistance effort. It was long believed that she participated in the Dutch resistance itself, but in 2016 the Airborne Museum &#x27;Hartenstein&#x27; reported that after extensive research it had not found any evidence of such activities. A 2019 book by Robert Matzen provided evidence, based on Hepburn&#x27;s personal statements, that she had supported the resistance by giving &quot;underground concerts&quot; to raise money, delivering the underground newspaper, and taking messages and food to downed Allied flyers hiding in the woodlands north of Velp. She also volunteered at a hospital that was the center of resistance activities in Velp, and, according to Hepburn, her family temporarily hid a British paratrooper in their home during the Battle of Arnhem. Matzen also claims that Hepburn carried messages for the Dutch Resistance, including to downed British paratroopers.

In addition to other traumatic events, she witnessed the transportation of Dutch Jews to concentration camps, later stating that &quot;more than once I was at the station seeing trainloads of Jews being transported, seeing all these faces over the top of the wagon. I remember, very sharply, one little boy standing with his parents on the platform, very pale, very blond, wearing a coat that was much too big for him, and he stepped on the train. I was a child observing a child.&quot;

After the Allied landing on D-Day, living conditions grew worse, and Arnhem was subsequently heavily damaged during Operation Market Garden. During the 1944–45 Dutch famine, the Germans hindered or reduced the already limited food and fuel supplies to civilians in retaliation for Dutch railway strikes that were held to disrupt the occupation. Like others, Hepburn&#x27;s family resorted to making flour out of tulip bulbs to bake cakes and biscuits, a source of starchy carbohydrates; Dutch doctors provided recipes for using tulip bulbs throughout the famine. Suffering from the effects of malnutrition, after the war ended Hepburn became gravely ill with jaundice, anaemia, oedema, and a respiratory infection. In October 1945, a letter from Ella asking for help was received by Micky Burn, a former lover and British Army officer with whom she had corresponded while he was a prisoner of war in Colditz Castle. He sent back thousands of cigarettes, which she was able to sell on the black market and thus buy the penicillin which saved Hepburn&#x27;s life. The Van Heemstra family&#x27;s financial situation changed significantly through the occupation, during which time many of their properties (including their principal estate in Arnhem) were damaged or destroyed.

==Entertainment career==
===1945–1952: Ballet studies and early acting roles===

After the war ended in 1945, Hepburn moved with her mother and siblings to Amsterdam, where she began ballet training under Sonia Gaskell, a leading figure in Dutch ballet, and Russian teacher Olga Tarasova. Due to the loss of the family fortune, Ella had to support them by working as a cook and housekeeper for a wealthy family. Hepburn made her film debut playing an air stewardess in &quot;Dutch in Seven Lessons&quot; (1948), an educational travel film made by Charles van der Linden and Henry Josephson.

Later that year, Hepburn moved to London after accepting a ballet scholarship with Ballet Rambert, which was then based in Notting Hill. She supported herself with part-time work as a model, and dropped &quot;Ruston&quot; from her surname. After she was told by Rambert that despite her talent, her height and weak constitution (the after-effect of wartime malnutrition) would make the status of prima ballerina unattainable, she decided to concentrate on acting. While Ella worked in menial jobs to support them, Hepburn appeared as a chorus girl in the West End musical theatre revues &quot;High Button Shoes&quot; (1948) at the London Hippodrome, and Cecil Landeau&#x27;s &quot;Sauce Tartare&quot; (1949) and &quot;Sauce Piquante&quot; (1950) at the Cambridge Theatre. Also, in 1950, she worked as a dancer in an exceptionally &quot;ambitious&quot; revue, &quot;Summer Nights,&quot; at Ciro&#x27;s London, a prominent nightclub.

During her theatrical work, she took elocution lessons with actor Felix Aylmer to develop her voice. After being spotted by the Ealing Studios casting director, Margaret Harper-Nelson, while performing in &quot;Sauce Piquante&quot;, Hepburn was registered as a freelance actress with the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC). She appeared in the BBC Television play &quot;The Silent Village&quot;, and in minor roles in the films &quot;One Wild Oat&quot;, &quot;Laughter in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Young Wives&#x27; Tale&quot;, and &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (all 1951). She was cast in her first major supporting role in Thorold Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;Secret People&quot; (1952), as a prodigious ballerina, performing all of her own dancing sequences.

Hepburn then took a small role in a bilingual film, &quot;Monte Carlo Baby&quot; (French: &quot;Nous Irons à Monte Carlo&quot;, 1952), which was filmed in Monte Carlo. Coincidentally, French novelist Colette was at the Hôtel de Paris in Monte Carlo during the filming, and decided to cast Hepburn in the title role in the Broadway play &quot;Gigi&quot;. Hepburn went into rehearsals having never spoken on stage, and required private coaching. When &quot;Gigi&quot; opened at the Fulton Theatre on 24 November 1951, she received praise for her performance, despite criticism that the stage version was inferior to the French film adaptation. &quot;Life&quot; called her a &quot;hit&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;her quality is so winning and so right that she is the success of the evening&quot;. Hepburn also received a Theatre World Award for the role. The play ran for 219 performances, closing on 31 May 1952, before going on tour, which began 13 October 1952 in Pittsburgh and visited Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Washington, D. C., and Los Angeles, before closing on 16 May 1953 in San Francisco.

===1953–1960: &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; and stardom===

Hepburn had her first starring role in &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953), playing Princess Ann, a European princess who escapes the reins of royalty and has a wild night out with an American newsman (Gregory Peck). On 18 September 1951, shortly after &quot;Secret People&quot; was finished but before its premiere, Thorold Dickinson made a screen test with the young starlet and sent it to director William Wyler, who was in Rome preparing &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. Wyler wrote a glowing note of thanks to Dickinson, saying that &quot;as a result of the test, a number of the producers at Paramount have expressed interest in casting her.&quot; The producers of the film had initially wanted Elizabeth Taylor for the role, but Wyler was so impressed by Hepburn&#x27;s screen test that he cast her instead. Wyler later commented, &quot;She had everything I was looking for: charm, innocence, and talent. She also was very funny. She was absolutely enchanting, and we said, &#x27;That&#x27;s the girl! Originally, the film was to have had only Gregory Peck&#x27;s name above its title, with &quot;Introducing Audrey Hepburn&quot; beneath in smaller font. Peck suggested Wyler elevate her to equal billing so her name appears before the title, and in type as large as his: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to change that because she&#x27;ll be a big star, and I&#x27;ll look like a big jerk.&quot;

The film was a box-office success, and Hepburn gained critical acclaim for her portrayal, unexpectedly winning an Academy Award for Best Actress, a BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama in 1953. In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. H. Weiler wrote: &quot;Although she is not precisely a newcomer to films, Audrey Hepburn, the British actress who is being starred for the first time as Princess Anne, is a slender, elfin, and wistful beauty, alternately regal and childlike in her profound appreciation of newly-found, simple pleasures and love. Although she bravely smiles her acknowledgement of the end of that affair, she remains a pitifully lonely figure facing a stuffy future.&quot;
Hepburn was signed to a seven-picture contract with Paramount, with 12 months in between films to allow her time for stage work. She was featured on 7 September 1953 cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and also became known for her personal style. Following her success in &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, Hepburn starred in Billy Wilder&#x27;s romantic Cinderella-story comedy &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954), in which wealthy brothers (Humphrey Bogart and William Holden) compete for the affections of their chauffeur&#x27;s innocent daughter (Hepburn). For her performance, she was nominated for the 1954 Academy Award for Best Actress, while winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role the same year. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that she was &quot;a young lady of extraordinary range of sensitive and moving expressions within such a frail and slender frame. She is even more luminous as the daughter and pet of the servants&#x27; hall than she was as a princess last year, and no more than that can be said.&quot;

Hepburn also returned to the stage in 1954, playing a water nymph who falls in love with a human in the fantasy play &quot;Ondine&quot; on Broadway. A critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that &quot;somehow, Miss Hepburn is able to translate [its intangibles] into the language of the theatre without artfulness or precociousness. She gives a pulsing performance that is all grace and enchantment, disciplined by an instinct for the realities of the stage&quot;. Her performance won her the 1954 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play three days after she won the Academy Award for &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, making her one of three actresses to receive the Academy and Tony Awards for Best Actress in the same year (the other two are Shirley Booth and Ellen Burstyn). During the production, Hepburn and her co-star Mel Ferrer began a relationship, and were married on 25 September 1954 in Switzerland.

Although she appeared in no new film releases in 1955, Hepburn received the Golden Globe for World Film Favorite that year. Having become one of Hollywood&#x27;s most popular box-office attractions, she starred in a series of successful films during the remainder of the decade, including her BAFTA- and Golden Globe-nominated role as Natasha Rostova in &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1956), an adaptation of the Tolstoy novel set during the Napoleonic wars, starring Henry Fonda and her husband Mel Ferrer. She exhibited her dancing abilities in her debut musical film, &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957), wherein Fred Astaire, a fashion photographer, discovers a beatnik bookshop clerk (Hepburn) who, lured by a free trip to Paris, becomes a beautiful model. Hepburn starred in another romantic comedy, &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot; (also 1957), alongside Gary Cooper and Maurice Chevalier.

Hepburn played Sister Luke in &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot; (1959), which focuses on the character&#x27;s struggle to succeed as a nun, alongside co-star Peter Finch. The role produced a third Academy Award nomination for Hepburn, and earned her a second BAFTA Award. A review in &quot;Variety&quot; reads: &quot;Hepburn has her most demanding film role, and she gives her finest performance&quot;, while Henry Hart in &quot;Films in Review&quot; stated that her performance &quot;will forever silence those who have thought her less an actress than a symbol of the sophisticated child/woman. Her portrayal of Sister Luke is one of the great performances of the screen.&quot; Hepburn spent a year researching and working on the role, saying, &quot;I gave more time, energy, and thought to this role than to any of my previous screen performances&quot;.

Following &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Story&quot;, Hepburn received a lukewarm reception for starring with Anthony Perkins in the romantic adventure &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (1959), in which she played Rima, a jungle girl who falls in love with a Venezuelan traveller, and &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; (1960), her only western film, in which she appeared opposite Burt Lancaster and Lillian Gish in a story of racism against a group of Native Americans.

===1961–1967: &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; and continued success===

Hepburn next starred as New Yorker Holly Golightly in Blake Edwards&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), a film loosely based on the Truman Capote novella of the same name. Capote disapproved of many changes that were made to sanitise the story for the film adaptation, and would have preferred Marilyn Monroe to have been cast in the role, although he also stated that Hepburn &quot;did a terrific job&quot;. The character is considered one of the best-known in American cinema, and a defining role for Hepburn. The dress she wears during the opening credits has been considered an icon of the 20th century, and perhaps the most famous &quot;little black dress&quot; of all time. Hepburn stated that the role was &quot;the jazziest of my career&quot; yet admitted: &quot;I&#x27;m an introvert. Playing the extroverted girl was the hardest thing I ever did.&quot; She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.

The same year, Hepburn also starred in William Wyler&#x27;s drama &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; (1961), in which she and Shirley MacLaine play teachers whose lives are destroyed after two pupils accuse them of being lesbians. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that the film &quot;is not too well acted&quot;, with the exception of Hepburn, who &quot;gives the impression of being sensitive and pure&quot; of its &quot;muted theme&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine also compliments Hepburn&#x27;s &quot;soft sensitivity, marvelous projection and emotional understatement&quot;, adding that Hepburn and MacLaine &quot;beautifully complement each other&quot;.
Hepburn next appeared opposite Cary Grant in the comic thriller &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), playing a young widow pursued by several men who chase after the fortune stolen by her murdered husband. The 59-year-old Grant, who had previously withdrawn from the starring male lead roles in &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; and &quot;Sabrina&quot;, was sensitive about his age difference with 34-year-old Hepburn, and was uncomfortable about the romantic interplay. To satisfy his concerns, the filmmakers agreed to alter the screenplay so that Hepburn&#x27;s character was pursuing him. The film turned out to be a positive experience for him; he said, &quot;All I want for Christmas is another picture with Audrey Hepburn.&quot; The role earned Hepburn her third, and final, competitive BAFTA Award, and another Golden Globe nomination. Critic Bosley Crowther was less kind to her performance, stating that, &quot;Hepburn is cheerfully committed to a mood of how-nuts-can-you-be in an obviously comforting assortment of expensive Givenchy costumes.&quot;

Although filmed in the summer of 1962 before &quot;Charade,&quot; Hepburn reunited with her &quot;Sabrina&quot; co-star William Holden in &quot;Paris When It Sizzles&quot; (1964), a screwball comedy in which she played the young assistant of a Hollywood screenwriter, who aids his writer&#x27;s block by acting out his fantasies of possible plots. Its production was troubled by several problems. Holden unsuccessfully tried to rekindle a romance with the now-married Hepburn, and his alcoholism was beginning to affect his work. After principal photography began, she demanded the dismissal of cinematographer Claude Renoir after seeing what she felt were unflattering dailies. Superstitious, she also insisted on dressing room 55 because that was her lucky number and required that Hubert de Givenchy, her long-time designer, be given a credit in the film for her perfume. Dubbed &quot;marshmallow-weight hokum&quot; by &quot;Variety&quot; upon its release in April, the film was &quot;uniformly panned&quot; but critics were kinder to Hepburn&#x27;s performance, describing her as &quot;a refreshingly individual creature in an era of the exaggerated curve&quot;.
Hepburn&#x27;s second film released in 1964 was George Cukor&#x27;s film adaptation of the stage musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, which premiered in October. &quot;Soundstage&quot; wrote that &quot;not since &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; has a motion picture created such universal excitement as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;&quot;, although Hepburn&#x27;s casting in the role of Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle was a source of dispute. Julie Andrews, who had originated the role on stage, was not offered the part because producer Jack L. Warner thought Hepburn was a more &quot;bankable&quot; proposition. Hepburn initially asked Warner to give the role to Andrews but was eventually cast. Further friction was created when, although non-singer Hepburn had sung in &quot;Funny Face&quot; and had lengthy vocal preparation for the role in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, her vocals were dubbed by Marni Nixon, whose voice was considered more suitable to the role. Hepburn was initially upset and walked off the set when informed.

Critics applauded Hepburn&#x27;s performance. Crowther wrote that, &quot;The happiest thing about [&quot;My Fair Lady&quot;] is that Audrey Hepburn superbly justifies the decision of Jack Warner to get her to play the title role.&quot; Gene Ringgold of &quot;Soundstage&quot; also commented that, &quot;Audrey Hepburn is magnificent. She is Eliza for the ages&quot;, while adding, &quot;Everyone agreed that if Julie Andrews was not to be in the film, Audrey Hepburn was the perfect choice.&quot; The reviewer in &quot;Time&quot; magazine said her &quot;graceful, glamorous performance&quot; was &quot;the best of her career&quot;. Andrews won an Academy Award for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; at the 1964 37th Academy Awards and Hepburn earned Best Actress nominations for Golden Globe and New York Film Critics Circle awards.

Hepburn appeared in an assortment of genres including the heist comedy &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; (1966). Hepburn played the daughter of a famous art collector, whose collection consists entirely of forgeries that are about to be exposed as fakes. Her character plays the part of a dutiful daughter trying to help her father with the help of a man played by Peter O&#x27;Toole. The film was followed by two films in 1967. The first was &quot;Two for the Road&quot;, a non-linear and innovative British dramedy that traces the course of a couple&#x27;s troubled marriage. Director Stanley Donen said that Hepburn was freer and happier than he had ever seen her, and he credited that to co-star Albert Finney. The second, &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot;, is a suspense thriller in which Hepburn demonstrated her acting range by playing the part of a terrorised blind woman. Filmed on the brink of her divorce, it was a difficult film for her, as husband Mel Ferrer was its producer. She lost 15 pounds under the stress, but she found solace in co-star Richard Crenna and director Terence Young. Hepburn earned her fifth and final competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Actress; Bosley Crowther affirmed, &quot;Hepburn plays the poignant role, the quickness with which she changes and the skill with which she manifests terror attract sympathy and anxiety to her and give her genuine solidity in the final scenes.&quot;

===1968–1993: Semi-retirement and final projects===

After 1967, Hepburn chose to devote more time to her family and acted only occasionally. She attempted a comeback playing Maid Marian in the period piece &quot;Robin and Marian&quot; (1976) with Sean Connery co-starring as Robin Hood, which was moderately successful. Roger Ebert praised Hepburn&#x27;s chemistry with Connery, writing, &quot;Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters. They glow. They really do seem in love. And they project as marvellously complex, fond, tender people; the passage of 20 years has given them grace and wisdom.&quot; Hepburn reunited with director Terence Young in the production of &quot;Bloodline&quot; (1979), sharing top-billing with Ben Gazzara, James Mason, and Romy Schneider. The film, an international intrigue amid the jet-set, was a critical and box-office failure. Hepburn&#x27;s last starring role in a feature film was opposite Gazzara in the comedy &quot;They All Laughed&quot; (1981), directed by Peter Bogdanovich. The film was overshadowed by the murder of one of its stars, Dorothy Stratten, and received only a limited release. Six years later, Hepburn co-starred with Robert Wagner in a made-for-television caper film, &quot;Love Among Thieves&quot; (1987).

After finishing her last motion picture role – a cameo appearance as an angel in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Always&quot; (1989) – Hepburn completed only two more entertainment-related projects, both critically acclaimed. &quot;Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn&quot; was a PBS documentary series, which was filmed on location in seven countries in the spring and summer of 1990. A one-hour special preceded it in March 1991, and the series itself began its national PBS premiere on 24 January 1993, the day of her funeral services in Tolochenaz. For the &quot;Flower Gardens&quot; episode, Hepburn was posthumously awarded the 1993 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement – Informational Programming. The other project was a spoken word album, &quot;Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s Enchanted Tales&quot;, which features readings of classic children&#x27;s stories and was recorded in 1992. It earned her a posthumous Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children.

==Humanitarian work==
In the 1950s, Hepburn narrated two radio programmes for UNICEF, re-telling children&#x27;s stories of war. In 1989, Hepburn was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF. On her appointment, she stated that she was grateful for receiving international aid after enduring the German occupation as a child, and wanted to show her gratitude to the organisation.

===1988–1992===

Hepburn&#x27;s first field mission for UNICEF was to Ethiopia in 1988. She visited an orphanage in Mek&#x27;ele that housed 500 starving children and had UNICEF send food. Of the trip, she said,
In August 1988, Hepburn went to Turkey on an immunisation campaign. She called Turkey &quot;the loveliest example&quot; of UNICEF&#x27;s capabilities. Of the trip, she said, &quot;The army gave us their trucks, the fishmongers gave their wagons for the vaccines, and once the date was set, it took ten days to vaccinate the whole country. Not bad.&quot; In October, Hepburn went to South America. Of her experiences in Venezuela and Ecuador, Hepburn told the United States Congress, &quot;I saw tiny mountain communities, slums, and shantytowns receive water systems for the first time by some miracle – and the miracle is UNICEF. I watched boys build their own schoolhouse with bricks and cement provided by UNICEF.&quot;

Hepburn toured Central America in February 1989, and met with leaders in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders as part of a mission called &quot;Operation Lifeline&quot;. Because of civil war, food from aid agencies had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to southern Sudan. Hepburn said, &quot;I saw but one glaring truth: These are not natural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution – peace.&quot; In October 1989, Hepburn and Wolders went to Bangladesh. John Isaac, a UN photographer, said, &quot;Often the kids would have flies all over them, but she would just go hug them. I had never seen that. Other people had a certain amount of hesitation, but she would just grab them. Children would just come up to hold her hand, touch her – she was like the Pied Piper.&quot;

In October 1990, Hepburn went to Vietnam, in an effort to collaborate with the government for national UNICEF-supported immunisation and clean water programmes. In September 1992, four months before she died, Hepburn went to Somalia. Calling it &quot;apocalyptic&quot;, she said, &quot;I walked into a nightmare. I have seen famine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like this – so much worse than I could possibly have imagined. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for this.&quot; Though scarred by what she had seen, Hepburn still had hope stating: 

===Recognition===
United States president George H. W. Bush presented Hepburn with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her work with UNICEF, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences posthumously awarded her the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her contribution to humanity. In 2002, at the United Nations Special Session on Children, UNICEF honoured Hepburn&#x27;s legacy of humanitarian work by unveiling a statue, &quot;The Spirit of Audrey&quot;, at UNICEF&#x27;s New York headquarters. Her service for children is also recognised through the United States Fund for UNICEF&#x27;s Audrey Hepburn Society.

==Personal life and final years==
===Multilingualism===
Alongside her native English and Dutch, Hepburn also had some fluency in French (which she learned at school in Belgium), German, Italian, and Spanish. Throughout her life, Hepburn lived in many countries, including spending her childhood in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands, and her adult years in the United States, Italy, and Switzerland, and travelled extensively during her later years of life as part of her humanitarian work with UNICEF.

===Marriages, relationships, and children===

In 1952, Hepburn became engaged to industrialist James Hanson, whom she had known since her early days in London. She called it &quot;love at first sight&quot;, but after having her wedding dress fitted and the date set, she decided the marriage would not work because the demands of their careers would keep them apart most of the time. She issued a public statement about her decision, saying &quot;When I get married, I want to be married&quot;. In the early 1950s, she also dated future &quot;Hair&quot; producer Michael Butler.

At a cocktail party hosted by mutual friend Gregory Peck, Hepburn met American actor Mel Ferrer, and suggested that they star together in a play. The meeting led them to collaborate in &quot;Ondine&quot;, during which they began a relationship. Eight months later, on 25 September 1954, they were married in Bürgenstock, Switzerland, while preparing to star together in the film &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1956). She and Ferrer had a son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer, born on 17 June 1960. Prior to Sean&#x27;s birth, Hepburn had two other pregnancies that ended in miscarriages, the second one at six months.

Ferrer was rumoured to be too controlling, and had been referred to by others as being her &quot;Svengali&quot; – an idea that Hepburn laughed off. William Holden was quoted as saying, &quot;I think Audrey allows Mel to think he influences her.&quot; After a 14-year marriage, the couple divorced in 1968.

Hepburn met her second husband, Italian psychiatrist Andrea Dotti, on a Mediterranean cruise with friends in June 1968. She believed she would have more children and possibly stop working. They married on 18 January 1969, and their son Luca Andrea Dotti was born on 8 February 1970. While pregnant with Luca in 1969, Hepburn was more careful, resting for months before delivering the baby via caesarean section. Hepburn suffered a miscarriage in 1974.

Dotti and Hepburn were unfaithful, he with younger women and she with actor Ben Gazzara during the filming of &quot;Bloodline&quot; (1979). The marriage lasted 12 years and was dissolved in 1982.

From 1980 until her death in 1993, Hepburn was in a relationship with Dutch actor Robert Wolders, the widower of actress Merle Oberon. She had met Wolders through a friend during the later years of her second marriage. In 1989, she called the nine years she had spent with him the happiest years of her life, and stated that she considered them married, just not officially.

===Illness and death===

Upon returning to Switzerland from Somalia in late September 1992, Hepburn developed abdominal pain. While initial medical tests in Switzerland had inconclusive results, a laparoscopy performed at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in early November revealed a rare form of abdominal cancer belonging to a group of cancers known as pseudomyxoma peritonei. Having grown slowly over several years, the cancer had metastasised as a thin coating over her small intestine. After surgery, Hepburn began chemotherapy.

Hepburn and her family returned home to Switzerland to celebrate her last Christmas. As she was still recovering from surgery, she was unable to fly on commercial aircraft. Her long-time friend, fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, arranged for socialite Rachel Lambert &quot;Bunny&quot; Mellon to send her private Gulfstream jet, filled with flowers, to take Hepburn from Los Angeles to Geneva. She spent her last days in hospice care at her home in Tolochenaz, Vaud, and was occasionally well enough to take walks in her garden, but gradually became more confined to bedrest.

On the evening of 20 January 1993, Hepburn died in her sleep at her home. She was 63. After her death, Gregory Peck recorded a tribute to Hepburn in which he recited the poem &quot;Unending Love&quot; by Rabindranath Tagore. Funeral services were held at the village church of Tolochenaz on 24 January 1993. Maurice Eindiguer, the same pastor who wed Hepburn and Mel Ferrer and baptised her son Sean in 1960, presided over her funeral, while Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan of UNICEF delivered a eulogy. Many family members and friends attended the funeral, including her sons, partner Robert Wolders, half-brother Ian Quarles van Ufford, ex-husbands Andrea Dotti and Mel Ferrer, Hubert de Givenchy, executives of UNICEF, and fellow actors Alain Delon and Roger Moore. Flower arrangements were sent to the funeral by Gregory Peck, Elizabeth Taylor, and the Dutch royal family.
Later on the same day, Hepburn was interred at the Tolochenaz Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Hepburn&#x27;s legacy has endured long after her death. The American Film Institute named Hepburn third among the greatest female stars of American cinema. She is one of few entertainers who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy and Tony Awards. She won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. She received a tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1991 and she was a frequent presenter at the Academy Awards. She received the BAFTA Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992. She was the recipient of numerous posthumous awards, including the 1993 Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and competitive Grammy and Emmy Awards. In January 2009, Hepburn was named on &quot;The Times&quot;″ list of the top 10 British actresses of all time. In 2010, Emma Thompson opined that Hepburn &quot;can&#x27;t sing and she can&#x27;t really act&quot;; some people agreed, others disagreed. Hepburn&#x27;s son Sean later said &quot;My mother would be the first person to say that she wasn&#x27;t the best actress in the world. But she was a movie star.&quot;
She has been the subject of many biographies since her death, including the 2000 dramatisation of her life titled &quot;The Audrey Hepburn Story&quot; which starred Jennifer Love Hewitt and Emmy Rossum as the older and younger Hepburn respectively. Her son and granddaughter, Sean and Emma Ferrer, helped produce a biographical documentary directed by Helena Coan, entitled &quot;Audrey&quot; (2020). The film was released to positive reception. 

In 2012, Hepburn was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his best known artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires. On 4 May 2014, Google featured a doodle on its homepage on what would have been Hepburn&#x27;s 85th birthday.

Sean Ferrer founded the Audrey Hepburn Children&#x27;s Fund in memory of his mother shortly after her death. The US Fund for UNICEF also founded the Audrey Hepburn Society: the Society hosted annual charity balls for fundraising, until Ferrer became involved in lawsuits in the late 2010s on behalf of his mother&#x27;s estate. Dotti also became patron of the Pseudomyxoma Survivor charity, dedicated to providing support to patients of the rare cancer that was fatal to Hepburn, pseudomyxoma peritonei, and Sean Ferrer became the rare disease ambassador since 2014 and for 2015 on behalf of European Organisation for Rare Diseases. A year after his mother&#x27;s death in 1993, Ferrer founded the Audrey Hepburn Children&#x27;s Fund (originally named Hollywood for Children Inc.), a charity funded by exhibitions of Audrey Hepburn memorabilia. He directed the charity in cooperation with his half-brother Luca Dotti, and Robert Wolders, his mother&#x27;s partner, which aimed to continue the humanitarian work of Audrey Hepburn. Ferrer brought the exhibition &quot;Timeless Audrey&quot; on a world tour to raise money for the foundation. He served as Chairman of the Fund before resigning in 2012, turning over the position to Dotti. In 2017, Ferrer was sued by the Fund for alleged self-serving conduct. In October 2017, Ferrer responded by suing the Fund for trademark infringement, claiming that the Fund no longer had the right to use Hepburn&#x27;s name or likeness. Ferrer&#x27;s suit against the Fund was dismissed in March 2018 due to the complaint&#x27;s failure to include Dotti as a defendant. In 2019, the court sided with Ferrer, with the judge ruling there was no merit to the charity&#x27;s claims it had the independent right to use Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s name and likeness, or to enter into contracts with third parties without Ferrer&#x27;s consent.

Hepburn&#x27;s image is widely used in advertising campaigns across the world. In Japan, a series of commercials used colourised and digitally enhanced clips of Hepburn in &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; to advertise Kirin black tea. In the United States, Hepburn was featured in a 2006 Gap commercial that used clips of her dancing from &quot;Funny Face&quot;, set to AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Back in Black&quot;, with the tagline &quot;It&#x27;s Back – The Skinny Black Pant&quot;. To celebrate its &quot;Keep it Simple&quot; campaign, the Gap made a sizeable donation to the Audrey Hepburn Children&#x27;s Fund. In 2013, a computer-manipulated representation of Hepburn was used in a television advert for the British chocolate bar Galaxy.

===Public image and style icon===
Hepburn was known for her fashion choices and distinctive look, to the extent that journalist Mark Tungate has described her as a recognisable brand. When she first rose to stardom in &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953), she was seen as an alternative feminine ideal that appealed more to women than men, compared to the more sexual and curvy Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor. With her short hairstyle, thick eyebrows, slim body, and &quot;gamine&quot; looks, she presented a look that young women found easier to emulate than those of more sexual film stars. In 1954, fashion photographer Cecil Beaton declared Hepburn the &quot;public embodiment of our new feminine ideal&quot; in &quot;Vogue&quot;, and wrote that &quot;Nobody ever looked like her before World War II ... Yet we recognise the rightness of this appearance in relation to our historical needs. The proof is that thousands of imitations have appeared.&quot; The magazine and its British version frequently reported on her style throughout the following decade. Alongside model Twiggy, Hepburn has been cited as one of the key public figures who made being very slim fashionable. &quot;Vogue&quot; has referred to her as &quot;the acme of classic beauty&quot;. 

Added to the International Best Dressed List in 1961, Hepburn was associated with a minimalistic style, usually wearing clothes with simple silhouettes that emphasised her slim body, such as monochromatic colours with occasional statement accessories. In the late 1950s, Hepburn popularised plain black leggings. She was in particular associated with French fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, who was first hired to design her on-screen wardrobe for her second Hollywood film, &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954), when she was still unknown as a film actor and he a young couturier just starting his fashion house. Although initially disappointed that &quot;Miss Hepburn&quot; was not Katharine Hepburn as he had mistakenly thought, Givenchy and Hepburn formed a life-long friendship. 

In addition to &quot;Sabrina&quot;, Givenchy designed her costumes for &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot; (1957), &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957), &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), &quot;Paris When It Sizzles&quot; (1964), and &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; (1966), as well as clothing her off screen. According to Moseley, fashion plays an unusually central role in many of Hepburn&#x27;s films, stating that &quot;the costume is not tied to the character, functioning &#x27;silently&#x27; in the mise-en-scène, but as &#x27;fashion&#x27; becomes an attraction in the aesthetic in its own right&quot;. She also became the face of Givenchy&#x27;s first perfume, &quot;L&#x27;Interdit&quot;, in 1957. In addition to her partnership with Givenchy, Hepburn was credited with boosting the sales of Burberry trench coats when she wore one in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, and was associated with Italian footwear brand Tod&#x27;s.

In her private life, Hepburn preferred to wear casual and comfortable clothes, contrary to the haute couture she wore on screen and at public events. Despite being admired for her beauty, she never considered herself attractive, stating in a 1959 interview that &quot;you can even say that I hated myself at certain periods. I was too fat, or maybe too tall, or maybe just plain too ugly... you can say my definiteness stems from underlying feelings of insecurity and inferiority. I couldn&#x27;t conquer these feelings by acting indecisive. I found the only way to get the better of them was by adopting a forceful, concentrated drive.&quot; In 1989, she stated that &quot;my look is attainable ... Women can look like Audrey Hepburn by flipping out their hair, buying the large glasses and the little sleeveless dresses.&quot;

Hepburn&#x27;s influence as a style icon still continued several decades after the height of her acting career in the 1950s and 1960s. Moseley notes that especially after her death in 1993, she became increasingly admired, with magazines frequently advising readers on how to get her look, and fashion designers using her as inspiration. Throughout her career and after her death, Hepburn received numerous accolades for her stylish appearance and attractiveness. For example, she was named the &quot;most beautiful woman of all time&quot; and &quot;most beautiful woman of the 20th century&quot; in polls by Evian and QVC respectively, and in 2015, was voted &quot;the most stylish Brit of all time&quot; in a poll commissioned by Samsung. Her film costumes fetch large sums of money in auctions: one of the &quot;little black dresses&quot; designed by Givenchy for &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; was sold by Christie&#x27;s for a record sum of £467,200 in 2006.

In 1999, HarperCollins published &quot;Audrey&#x27;s Style&quot; by Pamela Keogh, a 340-page tome devoted to Hepburn&#x27;s personality, beliefs and style. The book included interviews with some of the people who knew her best, and also included many photographs of her, some of which had been rarely seen before.

==Filmography and stage roles==

Hepburn was considered by some to be one of the most beautiful women of all time. Remembered as a film and style icon, she was ranked as the third greatest screen legend in American cinema by the American Film Institute. Her debut was as a flight stewardess in the 1948 Dutch film &quot;Dutch in Seven Lessons&quot;. Hepburn then performed on the British stage as a chorus girl in the musicals &quot;High Button Shoes&quot; (1948), and &quot;Sauce Tartare&quot; (1949). Two years later she made her Broadway debut as the title character in the play &quot;Gigi&quot;. Hepburn&#x27;s Hollywood debut as a runaway princess in William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953) opposite Gregory Peck made her a star. For her performance she received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. In 1954 she played a chauffeur&#x27;s daughter caught in a love triangle in Billy Wilder&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Sabrina&quot; opposite Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. In the same year Hepburn garnered the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for portraying the titular water nymph in the play &quot;Ondine&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
Hepburn received numerous awards and honours during her career. Hepburn won, or was nominated for, awards for her work in motion pictures, television, spoken-word recording, on stage, and humanitarian work. She was five-times nominated for an Academy Award, and she was awarded the 1953 Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1993, posthumously, for her humanitarian work. From five nominations, she won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role, and received a BAFTA Special Award in 1992.

<text>The United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) was established on April 9, 1991 following the Gulf War by Security Council Resolution 689 (1991) and fully deployed by early May 1991.

The task of joint military observers was to monitor the demilitarized zone (DMZ) along the Iraq-Kuwait border and the Khawr &#x27;Abd Allah waterway, deter border violations and report any hostile action. On February 5, 1993, under Security Council Resolution 806, the mandate was extended to include physical action to prevent violations and the force was expanded to an intended three mechanized infantry battalions plus support.

The mandate of UNIKOM was completed on October 6, 2003.

The force&#x27;s headquarters were in Umm Qasr, Iraq, within the DMZ. The maximum strength of the force was 1,187 on February 28, 1995. The Security Council extended its mandate for a final time in July 2003. The mission ended on September 30, 2003. There were over 135 military observers and civilian staff at the time, mainly protecting the border checkpoints. Ultimately, a new conflict, the War in Iraq, would dissolve the &quot;peacekeeping&quot; mission. Swarms of military equipment would gather in Kuwait and cross into Iraq&#x27;s borders during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During the mission, there were 18 fatalities.

Contributors are Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh (including the mechanized infantry battalion), Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation (Soviet Union before December 24, 1991), Senegal, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay and Venezuela
In addition, during the setting-up phase (April–October 1991), UNIKOM included a Canadian combat engineer regiment (1 CER), a Security Battalion consisting of a multinational Bn Staff (SWE-FIN-NOR) and five infantry companies, drawn from UNFICYP and UNIFIL. Those troops were provided by Austria, Denmark, Fiji, Ghana, Nepal, and United States. There was also a maintenance/repair &amp; recovery unit from Norway and a HQ logistic company from Sweden drawn from UNIFIL.

<doc id="52141" wikidata="Q190096" url="?curid=52141" title="Inversion (meteorology)">
<text>In meteorology, an inversion (or temperature inversion) is a phenomenon in which a layer of warmer air overlies cooler air. Normally, air temperature gradually decreases as altitude increases, but this relationship is reversed in an inversion.

An inversion traps air pollution, such as smog, near the ground. An inversion can also suppress convection by acting as a &quot;cap&quot;. If this cap is broken for any of several reasons, convection of any humidity can then erupt into violent thunderstorms. Temperature inversion can cause freezing rain in cold climates.

==Normal atmospheric conditions==
Usually, within the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) the air near the surface of the Earth is warmer than the air above it, largely because the atmosphere is heated from below as solar radiation warms the Earth&#x27;s surface, which in turn then warms the layer of the atmosphere directly above it, e.g., by thermals (convective heat transfer). Air temperature also decreases with an increase in altitude because higher air is at lower pressure, and lower pressure results in a lower temperature, following the ideal gas law and adiabatic lapse rate.

==Description==
Under the right conditions, the normal vertical temperature gradient is inverted so that the air is colder near the surface of the Earth. This can occur when, for example, a warmer, less-dense air mass moves over a cooler, denser air mass. This type of inversion occurs in the vicinity of warm fronts, and also in areas of oceanic upwelling such as along the California coast in the United States. With sufficient humidity in the cooler layer, fog is typically present below the inversion cap. An inversion is also produced whenever radiation from the surface of the earth exceeds the amount of radiation received from the sun, which commonly occurs at night, or during the winter when the sun is very low in the sky. This effect is virtually confined to land regions as the ocean retains heat far longer. In the polar regions during winter, inversions are nearly always present over land.

A warmer air mass moving over a cooler one can &quot;shut off&quot; any convection which may be present in the cooler air mass: this is known as a capping inversion. However, if this cap is broken, either by extreme convection overcoming the cap or by the lifting effect of a front or a mountain range, the sudden release of bottled-up convective energy—like the bursting of a balloon—can result in severe thunderstorms. Such capping inversions typically precede the development of tornadoes in the Midwestern United States. In this instance, the &quot;cooler&quot; layer is quite warm but is still denser and usually cooler than the lower part of the inversion layer capping it.

==Subsidence inversion==
An inversion can develop aloft as a result of air gradually sinking over a wide area and being warmed by adiabatic compression, usually associated with subtropical high-pressure areas. A stable marine layer may then develop over the ocean as a result. As this layer moves over progressively warmer waters, however, turbulence within the marine layer can gradually lift the inversion layer to higher altitudes, and eventually even pierce it, producing thunderstorms, and under the right circumstances, tropical cyclones. The accumulated smog and dust under the inversion quickly taints the sky reddish, easily seen on sunny days.

==Atmospheric consequences==


Temperature inversions stop atmospheric convection (which is normally present) from happening in the affected area and can lead to high concentrations of atmospheric pollutants. Cities especially suffer from the effects of temperature inversions because they both produce more atmospheric pollutants and have higher thermal masses than rural areas, resulting in more frequent inversions with higher concentrations of pollutants. The effects are even more pronounced when a city is surrounded by hills or mountains since they form an additional barrier to air circulation. During a severe inversion, trapped air pollutants form a brownish haze that can cause respiratory problems. The Great Smog of 1952 in London, England, is one of the most serious examples of such an inversion. It was blamed for an estimated 10,000 to 12,000 deaths.

Sometimes the inversion layer is at a high enough altitude that cumulus clouds can condense but can only spread out under the inversion layer. This decreases the amount of sunlight reaching the ground and prevents new thermals from forming. As the clouds disperse, sunny weather replaces cloudiness in a cycle that can occur more than once a day.

In winter, an inversion can lead to the development of ice pellets and freezing rain. Both these phenomena occur when snow melts in a warm layer aloft and falls into a colder layer near the surface. If the layer of cold air near the surface is thick enough, it will lead to the development of ice pellets as the raindrops re-freeze. A shallow layer does not give the raindrops enough time to freeze as they quickly fall through it, leading to the development of freezing rain. 

==Wave propagation==

===Light===
As the temperature of air increases, the index of refraction of air decreases, a side effect of hotter air being less dense. Normally this results in distant objects being shortened vertically, an effect that is easy to see at sunset when the sun is visible as an oval. In an inversion, the normal pattern is reversed, and distant objects are instead stretched out or appear to be above the horizon, leading to the phenomenon known as a Fata Morgana or mirage.

Inversions can magnify the so-called &quot;green flash&quot;—a phenomenon occurring at sunrise or sunset, usually visible for a few seconds, in which the sun&#x27;s green light is isolated due to dispersion. The shorter wavelength is refracted most, with the blue component of sunlight &quot;completely scattered out by Rayleigh scattering&quot;, making green the first or last light from the upper rim of the solar disc to be seen.

===Radio waves===

Very high frequency radio waves can be refracted by inversions, making it possible to hear FM radio or watch VHF low-band television broadcasts from long distances on foggy nights. The signal, which would normally be refracted up and away into space, is instead refracted down towards the earth by the temperature-inversion boundary layer. This phenomenon is called tropospheric ducting. Along coastlines during Autumn and Spring, due to multiple stations being simultaneously present because of reduced propagation losses, many FM radio stations are plagued by severe signal degradation disrupting reception.
In higher frequencies such as microwaves, such refraction causes multipath propagation and fading.

===Sound===
When an inversion layer is present, if a sound or explosion occurs at ground level, the sound wave is refracted by the temperature gradient (which affects sound speed) and returns to the ground. The sound, therefore, travels much better than normal. This is noticeable in areas around airports, where the sound of aircraft taking off and landing often can be heard at greater distances around dawn than at other times of day, and inversion thunder which is significantly louder and travels further than when it is produced by lightning strikes under normal conditions.

====Shock waves====
The shock wave from an explosion can be reflected by an inversion layer in much the same way as it bounces off the ground in an air-burst and can cause additional damage as a result. This phenomenon killed two people in the Soviet RDS-37 nuclear test when a building collapsed.

<doc id="52143" wikidata="Q174844" url="?curid=52143" title="Megacity">
<text>A megacity is a very large city, typically with a population of more than 10 million people. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) in its 2018 &quot;World Urbanization Prospects&quot; report defines megacities as urban agglomerations with over 10 million inhabitants. A University of Bonn report holds that they are &quot;usually defined as metropolitan areas with a total population of 10 million or more people&quot;. Elsewhere in other sources, from five to eight million is considered the minimum threshold, along with a population density of at least 2,000 per square kilometre. The terms conurbation, metropolis, and metroplex are also applied to the latter.

The total number of megacities in the world varies between different sources and their publication dates. The world had 32 according to EU Global Human Settlement Layer (in 2024), 33 according to UN DESA (in 2018), 39 according to the OECD, 44 according to &quot;Demographia&quot; (in 2023), and 45 according to &quot;CityPopulation.de&quot; (in 2023). In total, 53 unique places are mentioned as megacities across these sources. A good percentage of these urban agglomerations are in China and India. The other four countries with more than one megacity are Brazil, Japan, Pakistan, and the United States. African megacities are present in Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Angola and the DRC; European megacities are present in Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Turkey (also in Asia); megacities can be found in Latin America in the countries of Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Argentina.

Some sources identify the Greater Tokyo Area as the largest megacity in the world, while some others give the title to the Pearl River Delta in China.

==Urban Metric System==
Since, presently, urban data are based on arbitrary definitions that vary from country to country and from year or census to the next, making them difficult to compare, an Urban Metric System (UMS) has been conceived that could correct the problem, since it allows computing the urban area limits and central points, and it can be applied in the same way to all past, present and future population and job distributions. 

It is based on vector field calculations obtained by assuming that, in a given space, all inhabitants and jobs exert the same attractive force &quot;A&quot; and repulsive force &quot;R&quot;. The net force (&quot;A&quot; - &quot;R&quot;) exerted by each inhabitant or job is given by [1/(1 + &quot;d&quot;)] - [1/( &quot;β&quot; + &quot;d&quot;/2)], where &quot;d&quot; = distance and &quot;β&quot; is the only parameter. 

UMS distinguishes the following types of urban areas(including &quot;patropolises&quot; that are tantamount to &quot;megacities&quot;), each type corresponding to a given value of &quot;β&quot;:
UMS has been applied to some Canadian cases since 2018, but the data presented in this article are still based on the various existing national definitions, which are disparate.

==List of megacities==

==History==
The term &quot;megacity&quot; entered common use in the late 19th or early 20th centuries; one of the earliest documented uses of the term was by the University of Texas in 1904. Initially the United Nations used the term to describe cities of 8 million or more inhabitants, but now uses the threshold of 10 million. In the mid 1970s the term was coined by urbanist Janice Perlman referring to the phenomenon of very large urban agglomerations. 

In 1800, only 3% of the world&#x27;s population lived in cities, a figure that rose to 47% by the end of the twentieth century. In 1950, there were 83 cities with populations exceeding one million; by 2007, this number had risen to 468, with 153 of them located in Asia. Among the 27 megacities with populations over 10 million globally, 15 were situated in Asia.

In 2010, UN forecasted that urban population of 3.2 billion would rise to nearly 5 billion by 2030, when three out of five, or 60%, of people would live in cities. This increase will be most dramatic on the least-urbanized continents, Asia and Africa. Surveys and projections indicate that all urban growth over the next 25 years will be in developing countries. One billion people, almost one-seventh of the world&#x27;s population, now live in shanty towns. In many poor countries, overcrowded slums exhibit high rates of disease due to unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, and lack of basic health care. By 2030, over 2 billion people in the world will be living in slums. Over 90% of the urban population of Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda, three of the world&#x27;s most rural countries, already live in slums.

By 2025, Asia alone will have at least 30 megacities, including Mumbai, India (2015 population of 20.75 million people), Shanghai, China (2015 population of 35.5 million people), Delhi, India (2015 population of 21.8 million people), Tokyo, Japan (2015 population of 38.8 million people) and Seoul, South Korea (2015 population of 25.6 million people). The top eight provincial capital cities in China with urban areas exceeding 400 km²—Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Xi&#x27;an—accounted for 54.8% of the total urban area of all provincial capital cities in the country in 2015.

In Africa, Lagos, Nigeria has grown from 300,000 in 1950 to an estimated 21 million today.

===Growth===

For almost five hundred years, during the period of the Republic and later of the Empire, Rome was the largest, wealthiest, and most politically important city of the ancient world, rulling over Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa. It is often stated that its population passed one million people by the end of the 1st century BC, however, it is debated about whether the population actually reached such a large size. Rome&#x27;s population started declining in 402 AD when Flavius Honorius, Western Roman Emperor from 395 to 423, moved the government to Ravenna and Rome&#x27;s population declined to a mere 20,000 during the Early Middle Ages, reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins and vegetation.

Baghdad was likely the largest city in the world from shortly after its foundation in 762 AD until the 930s, with some estimates putting its population at over one million. Chinese capital cities Chang&#x27;an and Kaifeng also experienced huge population booms during prosperous empires. According to the census in the year 742 recorded in the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, 362,921 families with 1,960,188 persons were counted in Jingzhao Fu (京兆府), the metropolitan area including small cities in the vicinity of Chang&#x27;an. The medieval settlement surrounding Angkor, the one-time capital of the Khmer Empire which flourished between the 9th and 15th centuries, could have supported a population of up to one million people.
From around 1825 to 1918 London was the largest city in the world, with the population growing rapidly; it was the first city to reach a population of over 5 million in 1900. In 1950, New York City was the only urban area with a population of over 10 million. Geographers had identified 25 such areas as of October 2005, as compared with 19 megacities in 2004 and only nine in 1985. This increase has happened as the world&#x27;s population moves towards the high (75–85%) urbanization levels of North America and Western Europe.

Since the 2000s, the largest megacity has been the Greater Tokyo Area. The population of this urban agglomeration includes areas such as Yokohama and Kawasaki, and is estimated to be between 37 and 38 million. This variation in estimates can be accounted for by different definitions of what the area encompasses. While the prefectures of Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa, and Saitama are commonly included in statistical information, the Japan Statistics Bureau only includes the area within 50 kilometers of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Offices in Shinjuku, thus arriving at a smaller population estimate. A characteristic issue of megacities is the difficulty in defining their outer limits and accurately estimating the populations.

Another list defines megacities as urban agglomerations instead of metropolitan areas. As of 2021, there are 28 megacities by this definition, like Tokyo. Other sources list Nagoya and the Rhein-Ruhr as megacities.

==Challenges==
===Slums===

According to the United Nations, the proportion of urban dwellers living in slums or informal settlements decreased from 47 percent to 37 percent in the developing world between 1990 and 2005. However, due to rising population, the absolute number of slum dwellers is rising and passed 1 billion in 2018. The increase in informal settlement population has been caused by massive migration, both internal and transnational, into cities, which has caused growth rates of urban populations and spatial concentrations not seen before in history. The majority of these are located in informal settlements which often lack sufficient quality housing, sanitation, drainage, water access, and officially recognized addresses. These issues raise problems in the political, social, and economic arenas. People who live in slums or informal settlements often have minimal or no access to education, healthcare, or the urban economy.

===Crime===

As with any large concentration of people, there is usually crime. High population densities often result in higher crime rates, as visibly seen in growing megacities such as Karachi, Delhi, Cairo, Rio de Janeiro, and Lagos.

===Homelessness===

Megacities often have significant numbers of homeless people. The actual legal definition of homelessness varies from country to country, or among different entities or institutions in the same country or region.

In 2002, research showed that children and families were the largest growing segment of the homeless population in the United States, and this has presented new challenges, especially in services, to agencies. In the US, the government asked many major cities to come up with a ten-year plan to end homelessness. One of the results of this was a &quot;Housing first&quot; solution, rather than to have a homeless person remain in an emergency homeless shelter it was thought to be better to quickly get the person permanent housing of some sort and the necessary support services to sustain a new home. But there are many complications with this kind of program and these must be dealt with to make such an initiative work successfully in the middle to long term.

===Traffic congestion===
Traffic congestion is a condition on road networks that occurs as use increases, and is characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, increased pollution, and increased vehicular queueing. The Texas Transportation Institute estimated that, in 2000, the 75 largest metropolitan areas experienced 3.6 billion vehicle-hours of delay, resulting in 5.7 billion U.S. gallons (21.6 billion liters) in wasted fuel and $67.5 billion in lost productivity, or about 0.7% of the nation&#x27;s GDP. It also estimated that the annual cost of congestion for each driver was approximately $1,000 in very large cities and $200 in small cities. Traffic congestion is increasing in major cities and delays are becoming more frequent in smaller cities and rural areas. It also can result in various issues, including economic losses, energy waste, air and noise pollution, and more.

===Urban sprawl===
Urban sprawl, also known as suburban sprawl, is a multifaceted concept, which includes the spreading outwards of a city and its suburbs to its outskirts to low-density, auto-dependent development on rural land, with associated design features that encourage car dependency. As a result, some critics argue that sprawl has certain disadvantages including longer transport distances to work, high car dependence, inadequate facilities (e.g. health, cultural. etc.) and higher per-person infrastructure costs. Discussions and debates about sprawl are often obfuscated by the ambiguity associated with the phrase. For example, some commentators measure sprawl only with the average number of residential units per acre in a given area. But others associate it with decentralization (spread of population without a well-defined center), discontinuity (leapfrog development), segregation of uses, etc.

===Gentrification===
Gentrification and urban gentrification are terms for the socio-cultural changes in an area as a result of wealthier people buying property in a less prosperous community. As living costs rise, lower-income residents are forced to move out of the community leading to an increase in average income, which in turn makes the area more desirable to other wealthier property or business owners, further pushing the living costs up. This process also tends to lead to a decrease in average family size in the area. This type of population change reduces industrial land use when it is redeveloped for commerce and housing.

===Air pollution===

Air pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter, or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to humans or other living organisms, or damages the natural environment. This issue is particularly prevalent in developing nations. As part of the Global Environment Monitoring System, WHO and UNEP established an air pollution monitoring network that oversees 50 cities. Many urban areas have significant problems with smog, a type of air pollution derived from vehicle emissions from internal combustion engines and industrial fumes that react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog.

===Energy and material resources===
The sheer size and complexity of megacities gives rise to enormous social and environmental challenges. Whether megacities can develop sustainably depends to a large extent on how they obtain, share, and manage their energy and material resources. There are correlations between electricity consumption, heating and industrial fuel use, ground transportation energy use, water consumption, waste generation, and steel production in terms of level of consumption and how efficiently they use resources.

==In fiction==

Megacities are a common backdrop in dystopian science fiction, with examples such as the Sprawl in William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, and Mega-City One, a megalopolis of between 50 and 800 million people (fluctuations due to war and disaster) across the east coast of the United States, in the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; comic. In &quot;Demolition Man&quot; a megacity called &quot;San Angeles&quot; was formed from the joining of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Diego and the surrounding metropolitan regions following a massive earthquake in 2010. Fictional planet-wide megacities (ecumenopoleis) include Trantor in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; series of books and Coruscant (population two trillion) in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe.

<text>Gabriel Lamé (22 July 1795 – 1 May 1870) was a French mathematician who contributed to the theory of partial differential equations by the use of curvilinear coordinates, and the mathematical theory of elasticity (for which linear elasticity and finite strain theory elaborate the mathematical abstractions).

==Biography==
Lamé was born in Tours, in today&#x27;s &quot;département&quot; of Indre-et-Loire.

He became well known for his general theory of curvilinear coordinates and his notation and study of classes of ellipse-like curves, now known as Lamé curves or superellipses, and defined by the equation:

: formula_1

where &quot;n&quot; is any positive real number.

He is also known for his running time analysis of the Euclidean algorithm, marking the beginning of computational complexity theory. In 1844, using Fibonacci numbers, he proved that when finding the greatest common divisor of integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, the algorithm runs in no more than 5&quot;k&quot; steps, where &quot;k&quot; is the number of (decimal) digits of &quot;b&quot;. He also proved a special case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. He actually thought that he found a complete proof for the theorem, but his proof was flawed.
The Lamé functions are part of the theory of ellipsoidal harmonics.

He worked on a wide variety of different topics. Often problems in the engineering tasks he undertook led him to study mathematical questions. For example, his work on the stability of vaults and on the design of suspension bridges led him to work on elasticity theory. In fact this was not a passing interest, for Lamé made substantial contributions to this topic. Another example is his work on the conduction of heat which led him to his theory of curvilinear coordinates.

Curvilinear coordinates proved a very powerful tool in Lamé&#x27;s hands. He used them to transform Laplace&#x27;s equation into ellipsoidal coordinates and so separate the variables and solve the resulting equation.

His most significant contribution to engineering was to accurately define the stresses and capabilities of a press fit joint, such as that seen in a dowel pin in a housing.

In 1854, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Lamé died in Paris in 1870. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<text>Julius Plücker (16 June 1801 – 22 May 1868) was a German mathematician and physicist. He made fundamental contributions to the field of analytical geometry and was a pioneer in the investigations of cathode rays that led eventually to the discovery of the electron. He also vastly extended the study of Lamé curves.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Plücker was born at Elberfeld (now part of Wuppertal). After being educated at Düsseldorf and at the universities of Bonn, Heidelberg and Berlin he went to Paris in 1823, where he came under the influence of the great school of French geometers, whose founder, Gaspard Monge, had only recently died.

In 1825 he returned to Bonn, and in 1828 was made professor of mathematics.

In the same year he published the first volume of his &quot;Analytisch-geometrische Entwicklungen&quot;, which introduced the method of &quot;abridged notation&quot;.

In 1831 he published the second volume, in which he clearly established on a firm and independent basis projective duality. 

=== Career ===
In 1836, Plücker was made professor of physics at University of Bonn. In 1858, after a year of working with vacuum tubes of his Bonn colleague Heinrich Geißler, he published his first classical researches on the action of the magnet on the electric discharge in rarefied gases. He found that the discharge caused a fluorescent glow to form on the glass walls of the vacuum tube, and that the glow could be made to shift by applying an electromagnet to the tube, thus creating a magnetic field. It was later shown that the glow was produced by cathode rays.

Plücker, first by himself and afterwards in conjunction with Johann Hittorf, made many important discoveries in the spectroscopy of gases. He was the first to use the vacuum tube with the capillary part now called a Geissler tube, by means of which the luminous intensity of feeble electric discharges was raised sufficiently to allow of spectroscopic investigation. He anticipated Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff in announcing that the lines of the spectrum were characteristic of the chemical substance which emitted them, and in indicating the value of this discovery in chemical analysis. According to Hittorf, he was the first who saw the three lines of the hydrogen spectrum, which a few months after his death, were recognized in the spectrum of the solar protuberances.

In 1865, Plücker returned to the field of geometry and invented what was known as &quot;line geometry&quot; in the nineteenth century. In projective geometry, Plücker coordinates refer to a set of homogeneous co-ordinates introduced initially to embed the space of lines in projective space formula_1 as a quadric in formula_2. The construction uses 2×2 minor determinants, or equivalently the second exterior power of the underlying vector space of dimension 4. It is now part of the theory of Grassmannians formula_3
(formula_4-dimensional subspaces of an formula_5-dimensional vector space formula_6), to which the generalization of these co-ordinates to formula_7 minors of the formula_8 matrix of homogeneous coordinates, also known as Plücker coordinates, apply. The embedding of the Grassmannian formula_3 
into the projectivization formula_10 of the formula_11th exterior power of formula_12
is known as the Plücker embedding.

<doc id="52147" wikidata="Q1742397" url="?curid=52147" title="Sawtooth wave">
<text>The sawtooth wave (or saw wave) is a kind of non-sinusoidal waveform. It is so named based on its resemblance to the teeth of a plain-toothed saw with a zero rake angle. A single sawtooth, or an intermittently triggered sawtooth, is called a ramp waveform.

The convention is that a sawtooth wave ramps upward and then sharply drops. In a reverse (or inverse) sawtooth wave, the wave ramps downward and then sharply rises. It can also be considered the extreme case of an asymmetric triangle wave.

The equivalent piecewise linear functions
formula_1
formula_2
based on the floor function of time &quot;t&quot; is an example of a sawtooth wave with period 1.

A more general form, in the range −1 to 1, and with period &quot;p&quot;, is 
formula_3

This sawtooth function has the same phase as the sine function.

While a square wave is constructed from only odd harmonics, a sawtooth wave&#x27;s sound is harsh and clear and its spectrum contains both even and odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency. Because it contains all the integer harmonics, it is one of the best waveforms to use for subtractive synthesis of musical sounds, particularly bowed string instruments like violins and cellos, since the slip-stick behavior of the bow drives the strings with a sawtooth-like motion.

A sawtooth can be constructed using additive synthesis. For period &quot;p&quot; and amplitude &quot;a&quot;, the following infinite Fourier series converge to a sawtooth and a reverse (inverse) sawtooth wave:

formula_4
formula_5
formula_6

In digital synthesis, these series are only summed over &quot;k&quot; such that the highest harmonic, &quot;N&quot;max, is less than the Nyquist frequency (half the sampling frequency). This summation can generally be more efficiently calculated with a fast Fourier transform. If the waveform is digitally created directly in the time domain using a non-bandlimited form, such as &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot; − floor(&quot;x&quot;), infinite harmonics are sampled and the resulting tone contains aliasing distortion.

An audio demonstration of a sawtooth played at 440 Hz (A4) and 880 Hz (A5) and 1,760 Hz (A6) is available below. Both bandlimited (non-aliased) and aliased tones are presented.

== Applications ==
* Sawtooth waves are known for their use in electronic music. The sawtooth and square waves are among the most common waveforms used to create sounds with subtractive analog and virtual analog music synthesizers.
* Sawtooth waves are used in switched-mode power supplies. In the regulator chip the feedback signal from the output is continuously compared to a high-frequency sawtooth to generate a new duty cycle PWM signal on the output of the comparator.
* In the field of computer science, particularly in automation and robotics, formula_7 allows to calculate sums and differences of angles while avoiding discontinuities at 360° and 0°.
* The sawtooth wave is the form of the vertical and horizontal deflection signals used to generate a raster on CRT-based television or monitor screens. Oscilloscopes also use a sawtooth wave for their horizontal deflection, though they typically use electrostatic deflection.
** On the wave&#x27;s &quot;ramp&quot;, the magnetic field produced by the deflection yoke drags the electron beam across the face of the CRT, creating a scan line.
** On the wave&#x27;s &quot;cliff&quot;, the magnetic field suddenly collapses, causing the electron beam to return to its resting position as quickly as possible.
** The current applied to the deflection yoke is adjusted by various means (transformers, capacitors, center-tapped windings) so that the half-way voltage on the sawtooth&#x27;s cliff is at the zero mark, meaning that a negative current will cause deflection in one direction, and a positive current deflection in the other; thus, a center-mounted deflection yoke can use the whole screen area to depict a trace. The horizontal frequency is 15.734 kHz on NTSC, 15.625 kHz for PAL and SECAM.
** The vertical deflection system operates the same way as the horizontal, though at a much lower frequency (59.94 Hz on NTSC, 50 Hz for PAL and SECAM).
** The ramp portion of the wave must appear as a straight line. If otherwise, it indicates that the current isn&#x27;t increasing linearly, and therefore that the magnetic field produced by the deflection yoke is not linear. As a result, the electron beam will accelerate during the non-linear portions. This would result in a television image &quot;squished&quot; in the direction of the non-linearity. Extreme cases will show marked brightness increases, since the electron beam spends more time on that side of the picture. 
** The first television receivers had controls allowing users to adjust the picture&#x27;s vertical or horizontal linearity. Such controls were not present on later sets as the stability of electronic components had improved.

<text>The Battle of Covadonga took place in 722 between the army of Pelagius of Asturias and the army of commanders Alqama and Munuza, as part of the Umayyad Caliphate. Fought near Covadonga, in the Picos de Europa, it resulted in a victory for the Christian forces of Pelagius. It is traditionally regarded as the foundational event of the Kingdom of Asturias and thus the initial point of the Christian &quot;&quot; (&quot;reconquest&quot;) of Spain after the Umayyad conquest of 711.
==Prelude==
According to texts written by Mozarabs in northern Hispania during the late ninth century, the Visigoths in 718 elected a nobleman named Pelagius (c.685–737) as their &quot;princeps&quot;, or leader. Pelagius, the first monarch of the Asturian Kingdom, son of Favila, who had been a dignitary at the court of the Visigoth King Egica (687–700), established his headquarters at Cangas de Onís, Asturias and incited an uprising against the Umayyad Muslims.

From the beginning of the Muslim invasion of Hispania, refugees and combatants from the south of the peninsula had been moving north to avoid Islamic authority. Some had taken refuge in the remote mountains of Asturias in the northwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula. There, from among the dispossessed of the south, Pelagius recruited his band of fighters.

Historian Joseph F. O&#x27;Callaghan says the remnants of the Hispano-Gothic aristocracy still played an important role in the society of Hispania. At the end of Visigothic rule, the assimilation of Hispano-Romans and Visigoths was occurring at a fast pace. Their nobility had begun to think of themselves as constituting one people, the &quot;gens Gothorum&quot; or the &quot;Hispani&quot;. An unknown number of them fled and took refuge in Asturias or Septimania. In Asturias they supported Pelagius&#x27;s uprising, and joining with the indigenous leaders, formed a new aristocracy. The population of the mountain region consisted of native Astures, Galicians, Cantabri, Basques and other groups unassimilated into Hispano-Gothic society.

Pelagius&#x27;s first acts were to refuse to pay the &quot;jizya&quot; (tax on non-Muslims) to the Muslims any longer and to assault the small Umayyad garrisons that had been stationed in the area. Eventually, he managed to expel a provincial governor named Munuza from Asturias. He held the territory against a number of attempts to re-establish Muslim control, and soon founded the Kingdom of Asturias, which became a Christian stronghold against further Muslim expansion.

For the first few years, this rebellion posed no threat to the new masters of Hispania, whose seat of power had been established at Córdoba. Consequently, there was only a minor perfunctory reaction. Pelagius was not always able to keep the Muslims out of Asturias but neither could they defeat him, and as soon as the Moors left, he would always re-establish control. Islamic forces were focused on raiding Narbonne and Gaul, and there was a shortage of manpower for putting down an inconsequential insurrection in the mountains. Pelagius never attempted to force the issue, and it was an Umayyad defeat elsewhere that probably set the stage for the Battle of Covadonga. On July 9, 721, a Muslim force that had crossed the Pyrenees and invaded Francia was defeated by them in the Battle of Toulouse (721) (now France). This was the first serious setback in the Muslim campaign in southwestern Europe. Reluctant to return to Córdoba with such unalloyed bad news, the Umayyad wāli, Anbasa ibn Suhaym al-Kalbi, decided that putting down the rebellion in Asturias on his way home would afford his troops an easy victory and raise their flagging morale.

==Battle==
In 722, forces commanded by the Umayyad commanders Alqama and Munuza, and (according to legend) accompanied by Bishop Oppas of Seville, were sent to Asturias. As Alqama overran much of the region, folklore suggests that Oppas attempted to broker the surrender of his fellow Christians, but he failed in the effort. Pelagius and his force retreated deep into the mountains of Asturias, eventually retiring into a narrow valley flanked by mountains, which was easily defensible due to the impossibility of launching a broad-fronted attack. Pelagius may have had as few as three hundred men with him.

Alqama eventually arrived at Covadonga, and sent forward an envoy to convince Pelagius to surrender. He refused, so Alqama ordered his best troops into the valley to fight. The Asturians shot arrows and stones from the slopes of the mountains, and then, at the climactic moment, Pelagius personally led some of his soldiers out into the valley. They had been hiding in a cave, unseen by the Muslims. The Christian accounts of the battle claim that the slaughter among the Muslims was horrific, while Umayyad accounts describe it as a mere skirmish. Alqama himself fell in the battle, and his soldiers withdrew from the battlefield.

In the aftermath of Pelagius&#x27;s victory, the people of the conquered villages of Asturias now emerged with their weapons, and killed hundreds of Alqama&#x27;s retreating troops. Munuza, learning of the defeat, organized another force, and gathered what was left of the survivors of Covadonga. At some later date, he confronted Pelagius and his now greatly augmented force, near the modern town of Proaza. Again Pelagius won, and Munuza was killed in the fighting. The battle is commemorated at the shrine of Our Lady of Covadonga.

<text>\sin \left(2 \pi \left( 2 k - 1 \right) t\right)&lt;/math&gt;


A triangular wave or triangle wave is a non-sinusoidal waveform named for its triangular shape. It is a periodic, piecewise linear, continuous real function.

Like a square wave, the triangle wave contains only odd harmonics. However, the higher harmonics roll off much faster than in a square wave (proportional to the inverse square of the harmonic number as opposed to just the inverse).

==Definitions==
=== Definition ===
A triangle wave of period &quot;p&quot; that spans the range [0, 1] is defined as
formula_1
where formula_2 is the floor function. This can be seen to be the absolute value of a shifted sawtooth wave.

For a triangle wave spanning the range the expression becomes
formula_3
A more general equation for a triangle wave with amplitude formula_4 and period formula_5 using the modulo operation and absolute value is
formula_6

For example, for a triangle wave with amplitude 5 and period 4:
formula_7

A phase shift can be obtained by altering the value of the formula_8 term, and the vertical offset can be adjusted by altering the value of the formula_9 term.

As this only uses the modulo operation and absolute value, it can be used to simply implement a triangle wave on hardware electronics.

Note that in many programming languages, the codice_1 operator is a remainder operator (with result the same sign as the dividend), not a modulo operator; the modulo operation can be obtained by using codice_2 in place of codice_3. In e.g. JavaScript, this results in an equation of the form codice_4.

=== Relation to the square wave ===
The triangle wave can also be expressed as the integral of the square wave:
formula_10

=== Expression in trigonometric functions ===
A triangle wave with period &quot;p&quot; and amplitude &quot;a&quot; can be expressed in terms of sine and arcsine (whose value ranges from −&quot;π&quot;/2 to &quot;π&quot;/2):
formula_11
The identity formula_12 can be used to convert from a triangle &quot;sine&quot; wave to a triangular &quot;cosine&quot; wave. This phase-shifted triangle wave can also be expressed with cosine and arccosine:
formula_13

=== Expressed as alternating linear functions ===
Another definition of the triangle wave, with range from −1 to 1 and period &quot;p&quot;, is
formula_14

===Harmonics===
It is possible to approximate a triangle wave with additive synthesis by summing odd harmonics of the fundamental while multiplying every other odd harmonic by −1 (or, equivalently, changing its phase by ) and multiplying the amplitude of the harmonics by one over the square of their mode number, (which is equivalent to one over the square of their relative frequency to the fundamental).

The above can be summarised mathematically as follows:
formula_15
where is the number of harmonics to include in the approximation, is the independent variable (e.g. time for sound waves), formula_16 is the fundamental frequency, and is the harmonic label which is related to its mode number by formula_17.

This infinite Fourier series converges quickly to the triangle wave as tends to infinity, as shown in the animation.

==Arc length==
The arc length per period for a triangle wave, denoted by &quot;s&quot;, is given in terms of the amplitude &quot;a&quot; and period length &quot;p&quot; by
formula_18

<text>Cree ( ; also known as Cree–Montagnais–Naskapi) is a dialect continuum of Algonquian languages spoken by approximately 86,475 indigenous people across Canada in 2021, from the Northwest Territories to Alberta to Labrador. If considered one language, it is the aboriginal language with the highest number of speakers in Canada. The only region where Cree has any official status is in the Northwest Territories, alongside eight other aboriginal languages. There, Cree is spoken mainly in Fort Smith and Hay River.

==Names==
Endonyms are:
* (Plains Cree)
* (Woods Cree)
* (Western Swampy Cree)
* (Eastern Swampy Cree)
* (Moose Cree)
* (Southern East Cree)
* (Northern East Cree)
* (Atikamekw)
* (Western Montagnais, Piyekwâkamî dialect)
* (Western Montagnais, Betsiamites dialect)
* (Eastern Montagnais)

== Origin and diffusion ==
Cree is believed to have begun as a dialect of the Proto-Algonquian language spoken between 2,500 and 3,000 years ago in the original Algonquian homeland, an undetermined area thought to be near the Great Lakes. The speakers of the proto-Cree language are thought to have moved north, and diverged rather quickly into two different groups on each side of James Bay. The eastern group then began to diverge into separate dialects, whereas the western grouping probably broke into distinct dialects much later. After this point it is very difficult to make definite statements about how different groups emerged and moved around, because there are no written works in the languages to compare, and descriptions by Europeans are not systematic; as well, Algonquian people have a tradition of bilingualism and even of outright adopting a new language from neighbours.

A traditional view among 20th-century anthropologists and historians of the fur trade posits that the Western Woods Cree and the Plains Cree (and therefore their dialects) did not diverge from other Cree peoples before 1670, when the Cree expanded out of their homeland near James Bay because of access to European firearms. By contrast, James Smith of the Museum of the American Indian stated, in 1987, that the weight of archeological and linguistic evidence puts the Cree as far west as the Peace River Region of Alberta before European contact.

== Dialect criteria ==
The Cree dialect continuum can be divided by many criteria. Dialects spoken in northern Ontario and the southern James Bay, Lanaudière, and Mauricie regions of Quebec differentiate (sh as in &quot;she&quot;) and , while those to the west have merged the two phonemes as and in the east the phonemes are merged as either or . In several dialects, including northern Plains Cree and Woods Cree, the long vowels and have merged into a single vowel, . In the Quebec communities of Chisasibi, Whapmagoostui, and Kawawachikamach, the long vowel has merged with .

However, the most transparent phonological variation between different Cree dialects are the reflexes of Proto-Algonquian *l in the modern dialects, as shown below:

The Plains Cree, speakers of the y dialect, refer to their language as &#x27;, whereas Woods Cree speakers say &#x27;, and Swampy Cree speakers say &quot;&quot;.

Another important phonological variation among the Cree dialects involves the palatalisation of Proto-Algonquian *k: East of the Ontario–Quebec border (except for Atikamekw), Proto-Algonquian *k has changed into or before front vowels. See the table above for examples in the * column.

Very often the Cree dialect continuum is divided into two languages: Cree and Montagnais. Cree includes all dialects which have not undergone the *k &gt; sound change (BC–QC) while Montagnais encompasses the territory where this sound change has occurred (QC–NL). These labels are very useful from a linguistic perspective but are confusing as &quot;East Cree&quot; then qualifies as Montagnais. For practical purposes, Cree usually covers the dialects which use syllabics as their orthography (including Atikamekw but excluding Kawawachikamach Naskapi), the term Montagnais then applies to those dialects using the Latin script (excluding Atikamekw and including Kawawachikamach Naskapi). The term Naskapi typically refers to Kawawachikamach (y-dialect) and Natuashish (n-dialect).

==Dialect groups==
The Cree dialects can be broadly classified into nine groups. Roughly from west to east:

==Phonology==
This table shows the possible consonant phonemes in the Cree language or one of its varieties.


In dictionaries focused on Eastern Swampy Cree, Western Swampy Cree may readily substitute with , while Lowland Moose Cree may readily substitute with their . In dictionaries focused on Southern Plains Cree, Northern Plains Cree may readily substitute with , while materials accommodating Rocky Cree will indicate the Plains Cree that is in Rocky Cree as . Similarly, in dictionaries focused on Western Swampy Cree, Woods Cree may readily substitute with , while materials accommodating Woods Cree will indicate the Western Swampy Cree that is in Woods Cree as . Atikamekw uses [], [], and [] (which also serves as []). Eastern James Bay Cree prefers to indicate long vowels (other than ) by doubling the vowel, while the western Cree use either a macron or circumflex diacritic; as is always long, often it is written as just without doubling or using a diacritic. While Western Cree dialects make use of and either or , Eastern Cree dialects instead make use of and either , , or .

==Syntax==

Cree features a complex polysynthetic morphosyntax. A common grammatical feature in Cree dialects, in terms of sentence structure, is non-regulated word order. Word order is not governed by a specific set of rules or structure; instead, &quot;subjects and objects are expressed by means of inflection on the verb&quot;. Subject, Verb, and Object (SVO) in a sentence can vary in order, for example, SVO, VOS, OVS, and SOV.

Obviation is also a key aspect of the Cree language(s). In a sense, the obviative can be defined as any third-person ranked lower on a hierarchy of discourse salience than some other (proximate) discourse-participant. &quot;Obviative animate nouns, [in the Plains Cree dialect for instance], are marked by [a suffix] ending , and are used to refer to third persons who are more peripheral in the discourse than the proximate third person&quot;. For example:

The suffix marks Susan as the obviative, or &#x27;fourth&#x27; person, the person furthest away from the discourse.

The Cree language has grammatical gender in a system that classifies nouns as animate or inanimate. The distribution of nouns between animate or inanimate is not phonologically transparent, which means gender must be learned along with the noun.

As is common in polysynthetic languages, a Cree word can be very long, and express something that takes a series of words in English. For example:

This means that changing the word order in Cree can place emphasis on different pieces of the sentence. Wolfart and Carroll give the following example by transposing the two Cree words:
==Writing==

Cree dialects, except for those spoken in eastern Quebec and Labrador, are traditionally written using Cree syllabics, a variant of Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, but can be written with the Latin script as well. Both writing systems represent the language phonetically. Cree is always written from left to right horizontally. The easternmost dialects are written using the Latin script exclusively. The dialects of Plains Cree, Woods Cree, and western Swampy Cree use Western Cree syllabics and the dialects of eastern Swampy Cree, East Cree, Moose Cree, and Naskapi use Eastern Cree syllabics.

=== Syllabics ===

In Cree syllabics, each symbol, which represents a consonant, can be written four ways, each direction representing its corresponding vowel. Some dialects of Cree have up to seven vowels, so additional diacritics are placed after the syllabic to represent the corresponding vowels. Finals represent stand-alone consonants. The Cree language also has two semivowels. The semivowels may follow other consonants or be on their own in a word.

The following tables show the syllabaries of Eastern and Western Cree dialects, respectively:

Speakers of various Cree dialects have begun creating dictionaries to serve their communities. Some projects, such as the Cree Language Resource Project, are developing an online bilingual Cree dictionary for the Cree language.

Cree syllabics has not commonly or traditionally used the period (). Instead, either a full-stop glyph () or a double em-width space has been used between words to signal the transition from one sentence to the next.

=== Romanization ===

For Plains Cree and Swampy Cree, Standard Roman Orthography (SRO) uses fourteen letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet to denote the dialect&#x27;s ten consonants (, , , , , , , , and ) and seven vowels (, , , , , and ). Upper case letters are not used. For more details on the phonetic values of these letters or variant orthographies, see the § Phonology section above.

The sound of Woods Cree is written , or in more recent material. Plains and Swampy material written to be cross-dialectical often modify to and to when those are pronounced in Swampy. is used in Eastern dialects where &quot;s&quot; and &quot;š&quot; are distinct phonemes. In other dialects, &quot;s&quot; is used even when pronounced like .

 and are used natively in Moose and Attikamek Cree, but in other dialects only for loanwords.

The stops, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, and the affricate, &quot;c&quot;, can be pronounced either voiced or unvoiced, but the symbols used for writing these sounds all correspond to the unvoiced pronunciation, e.g. not , not , etc. The phoneme is represented by , as it is in various other languages.

Long vowels are denoted with either a macron, as in , or a circumflex, as in . Use of either the macron or circumflex is acceptable, but usage should be consistent within a work. The vowel &quot;ē&quot; , used in southern Plains Cree, is always long and the grapheme is never used. In northern Plains Cree the sound has merged with &quot;ī&quot;, and thus is not used at all.

The use of unmarked and marked for the phonemes and emphasizes the relationship that can exist between these two vowels. There are situations where &quot;o&quot; can be lengthened to &quot;ō&quot;, as for example in &#x27;sing (now)!&#x27; and &#x27;sing (later)!&#x27;.

In alphabetic writing, the use of punctuation has been inconsistent. For instance, in the Plains Cree dialect, the interrogative enclitic &quot;cî&quot; can be included in the sentence to mark a yes–no question such that this is sometimes considered to be sufficient without including a question mark (?). However, in many modern publications and text collections (&quot;cf.&quot; &quot;The Counselling Speeches of Jim Kâ-Nîpitêhtêw&quot; (1998)) full punctuation is used.

Additionally, other interrogatives (&quot;where, when, what, why, who&quot;) can be used, as in other languages, and questions marks can thus be used for such questions in Cree as well.

Hyphenation can be used to separate a particle from the root word that it prefixes, especially particles that precede verbs (&quot;preverbs&quot; or &quot;indeclinable preverbs&quot;) or nouns (&quot;prenouns&quot; or &quot;indeclinable prenouns&quot;). One example is (&#x27;start speaking!&#x27;), derived from . Note that can neither stand alone as a separate word, nor is it an essential part of a stem. There are some more complex situations where it is difficult to determine whether an element is a particle. Some frequently used compound words can be written as unhyphenated. Stress can be predicted in some cases based on hyphenation.

Vowel reduction or vowel dropping, as is common of unstressed short &quot;i&quot; , is not denoted in order to be more cross-dialectal—instead of using apostrophes, the full unreduced vowels are written.

Representation of sandhi (such as → ) can be written or not written, as sandhi representation introduces greater complexity. There are additional rules regarding &quot;h&quot; and &quot;iy&quot; that may not match a given speaker&#x27;s speech, to enable a standardized transcription.

==Contact languages==

Cree is also a component language in at least five contact languages: Michif, Northern Michif, Bungi, Oji-Cree, and Nehipwat. Michif and Bungi are spoken by members of the Métis, and historically by some Voyageurs and European settlers of Western Canada and in parts of the Northern United States. Nehipwat and Oji-Cree are blends of Cree with Assiniboine (Nehipwat) and Ojibwe (Oji-Cree).

Michif is a mixed language which combines Cree with French. For the most part, Michif uses Cree verbs, question words, and demonstratives while using French nouns. Michif is unique to the Canadian prairie provinces as well as to North Dakota and Montana in the United States. Michif is still spoken in central Canada and in North Dakota.

Bungi is a creole based on Scottish English, Scots, Scottish Gaelic, Cree, and Ojibwe. Some French words have also been incorporated into its lexicon. This language flourished at and around the Red River Settlement (the modern-day location of Winnipeg, Manitoba) by the mid- to late-1800s. Bungi is now virtually extinct, as its features are being abandoned in favour of standard English.

Cree has also been incorporated into another mixed language within Canada, Nehipwat, which is a blending of Cree with Assiniboine. Nehipwat is found only in a few southern Saskatchewan reserves and is now nearing extinction. Nothing is known of its structure.

== Loss of language ==
Doug Cuthand argues three reasons for the loss of the Cree language among many speakers over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. First, residential schools cultivated the prejudice that their language was inferior. While students were still speaking their native language at home, their learning stopped at school. When they left residential schools as adults, they went home and their vocabulary and knowledge of language did not include concepts or forms that an adult speaker who had not been taken to a residential school would have.

Cuthand also argues that the loss of the Cree language can be attributed to the migration of native families away from the reserve, voluntarily or not. Oftentimes, the elders are left on the reserve. This breaks up the traditional intergenerational flow of lingual knowledge from elder to youth.

The third point Cuthand argues is that Cree language loss was adopted by the speakers. Parents stopped teaching their children their native language in the belief that doing so would help their children find economic success or avoid discrimination.
==Legal status==

The social and legal status of Cree varies across Canada. Cree is one of the eleven official languages of the Northwest Territories, but is only spoken by a small number of people there in the area around the town of Fort Smith. It is also one of two principal languages of the regional government of Eeyou Istchee James Bay in Northern Quebec, the other being French.

Robert Falcon Ouellette, a Cree Member of Parliament, played a pivotal role in promoting Indigenous languages especially Cree within the Canadian Parliament and Canadian House of Commons. He was instrumental in obtaining unanimous consent from all political parties to change the standing orders to allow Indigenous languages to be spoken in the House of Commons, with full translation services provided. This historic change enabled Ouellette to deliver a speech in Cree with interpretation supported by language educator Kevin Lewis, marking the first use of an Indigenous language in the House of Commons on Jan 28, 2019.

Furthermore, Bill C-91, the Indigenous Languages Act passed in 2019, was enacted to support and revitalize Indigenous languages across Canada. This legislation, aims to reclaim, revitalize, and maintain Indigenous languages through sustainable funding and the establishment of the Office of the Commissioner of Indigenous Languages. Ouellette was the chair of the Indigenous caucus in the House of Commons and helped ensure it passage before the election of 2019.

== Support and revitalization ==
As of 2017, Cree had about 117,000 documented speakers. They are still a minority language given the dominance of English and French in Canada. There are programs in place to maintain and revitalize the language, though. In the Quebec James Bay Cree community, a resolution was put into action in 1988 that made Cree the language of education in primary schools and eventually elementary schools.

The Mistissini council decided to require their employees to learn Cree syllabics in 1991.

The Cree School Board now has its annual report available in both English and Cree.

There is a push to increase the availability of Cree stations on the radio.

In 2013, free Cree language electronic books for beginners became available for Alberta language teachers.

The Government of the Northwest Territories releases an annual report on First Nations languages. The 2016–2017 report features successes they have had in revitalizing and supporting and projects they are working on. For example, they released a Medicinal Plant Guide that had information in both Cree and English. An important part of making the guide was input from the elders. Another accomplishment was the dubbing of a movie in Cree. They are working on broadcasting a radio station that &quot;will give listeners music and a voice for our languages&quot;.

Joshua Whitehead is one writer who has used the Cree language as part of his poetry.

<text>Year 13 BC was either a common year starting on Friday, Saturday or Sunday or a leap year starting on Friday or Saturday of the Julian calendar (the sources differ, see leap year error for further information) and a leap year starting on Wednesday of the Proleptic Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Nero and Varus (or, less frequently, year 741 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 13 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>A grook () is a form of short aphoristic poem or rhyming aphorism created by the Danish poet, designer, inventor, and scientist Piet Hein. He wrote over 7,000 of them from 1939 until his death in 1996, mostly in Danish. The grooks are multi-faceted and characterized by irony, paradox, brevity, precise use of language, rhythm and rhyme, and an often satiric nature. Many of the grooks have an accompanying line drawing, which provides additional meaning.

Some say that the name &quot;gruk&quot; is short for &quot;grin &amp; suk&quot; (), but Piet Hein said he felt that the word had come out of thin air. The contemporary &quot;Hunden Grog&quot; (&quot;Grog the Dog&quot;) stories by fellow cartoonist Storm P. have, in public opinion, been regarded as an inspiration.

==Grooks as passive resistance==
Piet Hein was president of the Anti-Nazi Union when the Germans invaded Denmark in 1940. He became an underground passive resister. He found a way to encourage resistance
through the use of poems, which he called &quot;gruks&quot; (&quot;grooks&quot; in English),
and began publishing them in the daily newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot; under the pseudonym
&quot;Kumbel Kumbell&quot;.

==Grooks in English==
Beginning in the 1960s, seven volumes of English translations of 53 grooks each (all translated by Jens Arup) were published and became popular in the U.S. counterculture of the time:
* &quot;Grooks&quot; (1966)
* &quot;Grooks 2&quot; (1968)
* &quot;Grooks 3&quot; (1970)
* &quot;Grooks 4&quot; (1972)
* &quot;Grooks 5&quot; (1973)
* &quot;Grooks VI&quot; (1978)
* &quot;Grooks VII&quot; (1984)

, Piet Hein and/or his estate have also published the following books of grooks:

* &quot;Collected Grooks I&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Collected Grooks II&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Runaway Runes: Short Grooks I&quot;
* &quot;Viking Vistas: Short Grooks II&quot;

<text>The 1280s BC was a decade which lasted from 1289 BC to 1280 BC.

==Events and trends==
*1290 BC—Seti I becomes pharaoh of Egypt. During his reign he leads his armies into Asia, asserting Egyptian imperial authority. Seti recaptures the traitorous vassals of Kadesh and Amurru, and even defeats a Hittite force. Later, he is unable to maintain control over the territories in the Levant and eventually concludes peace with the Hittite king Muwatalli II.
*c. 1285 BC—Judgement of Hunefer before Osiris, illustration from a Book of the Dead is painted (19th Dynasty). It is now in the British Museum at London.
*1282 BC—Pandion II, legendary King of Athens, dies after a nominal reign of 25 years. He reportedly only reigned in Megara, while Athens and the rest of Attica were under the control of an alliance of Nobles led by his uncle Metion (son of Erechtheus of Athens) and his sons (including in some accounts Daedalus). His four sons lead a successful military campaign to regain the throne. Aegeus becomes King of Athens, Nisos reigns in Megara, Lykos in Euboea and Pallas in southern Attica.
*c. 1280 BC—The Torah is believed to have been fully composed around this time. (Assuming the Exodus from Egypt took place c. 1450 BCE)
* The walls of Troy VII/Wilusa are constructed.

==Significant people==
* Seti I, pharaoh of Egypt (1290 BC–1279 BC) (19th Dynasty)
*Alaksandu of Wilusa, some believe would be the same Paris of Troy

<text>Dendrobranchiata is a suborder of decapods, commonly known as prawns. There are 540 extant species in seven families, and a fossil record extending back to the Devonian. They differ from related animals, such as Caridea and Stenopodidea, by the branching form of the gills and by the fact that they do not brood their eggs, but release them directly into the water. They may reach a length of over and a mass of , and are widely fished and farmed for human consumption.

==Shrimp and prawns==
While Dendrobranchiata and Caridea belong to different suborders of Decapoda, they are very similar in appearance, and in many contexts such as commercial farming and fisheries, they are both often referred to as &quot;shrimp&quot; and &quot;prawn&quot; interchangeably. In the United Kingdom, Australia and some other Commonwealth, the word &quot;prawn&quot; is used almost exclusively, while the opposite is the case in North America. The term &quot;prawn&quot; is also loosely used to describe any large shrimp, especially those that come 15 (or fewer) to the pound (such as &quot;king prawns&quot;, yet sometimes known as &quot;jumbo shrimp&quot;).

==Description==
Together with other swimming Decapoda, Dendrobranchiata show the &quot;caridoid facies&quot;, or shrimp-like form. The body is typically robust, and can be divided into a cephalothorax (head and thorax fused together) and a pleon (abdomen). The body is generally slightly flattened side-to-side. The largest species, &quot;Penaeus monodon&quot;, can reach a mass of and a length of .

===Head===

The most conspicuous appendages arising from the head are the antennae. The first pair are biramous (having two flagella), except in Luciferidae, and are relatively small. The second pair can be 2–3 times the length of the body and are always uniramous (having a single flagellum). The mouthparts comprise pairs of mandibles, maxillules and maxillae, arising from the head, and three pairs of maxillipeds, arising from the thorax. A pair of stalked eyes points forwards from the head.

===Thorax===
The carapace grows from the thorax to cover the cephalothorax, and extends forwards between the eyes into a rostrum. This is only as long as the stalked eyes in Benthesicymidae, Luciferidae and Sergestidae, but considerably longer in Aristeidae.

As well as the three pairs of maxillipeds, the thorax also bears five pairs of pereiopods, or walking legs; the first three of these end in small chelae (pincers). The last two pereiopods are absent in Luciferidae and &quot;Acetes&quot;, but much longer than the preceding pereiopods in &quot;Hymenopenaeus&quot; and &quot;Xiphopenaeus&quot;.

The thoracic appendages carry gills, which are protected beneath the carapace. The gills are typically branched, and so resemble trees, lending the group its scientific name, Dendrobranchiata, from the Greek words (&#x27;, tree) and (&#x27;, gills).

===Pleon===
The pleon, or abdomen, is similar in length to the cephalothorax. It has six segments, the first five bearing lamellar pleopods, and the last one bearing uropods. The pleopods are biramous, except in Sicyoniidae, where they are uniramous. The uropods and telson collectively form the tail fan; the uropods are not divided by a diaeresis, as they are in many other decapods. The telson is pointed and is usually armed with four pairs of setae or spines.

===Internal anatomy===
Most of the musculature of a prawn is used for bending the pleon, and almost all the space in the pleon is filled by muscle. More than 17 muscles operate each of the pleopods, and a further 16 power the tail fan in the rapid backward movement of the caridoid escape reaction. These muscles, collectively, are the meat for which prawns are commercially fished and farmed.

The nervous system of prawns comprises a dorsal brain, and a ventral nerve cord, connected by two commissures around the oesophagus. The chief sensory inputs are visual input from the eyes, chemoreceptors on the antennae and in the mouth, and mechanoreceptors on the antennae and elsewhere.

The digestive system comprises a foregut, a midgut and a hindgut, and is situated dorsally. The foregut begins at the mouth, passes through the oesophagus, and opens into a sac that contains the grinding apparatus of the gastric mill. The hepatopancreas feeds into the midgut, where digestive enzymes are released, and nutrients taken up. The hindgut forms faecal pellets, which are then passed out through the muscular anus.

The circulatory system is based around a compact, triangular heart, which pumps blood into three main arteries. Excretion is carried out through the gills, and by specialised glands located at the base of the antennae, and is mostly in the form of ammonia.

==Life cycle==
Prawns may be divided into two groups: those with an open thelycum (female genitalia) and those with a closed thelycum. In the open-thelycum species, mating takes place towards the end of the moulting cycle, and usually at sunset. In closed-thelycum species, mating takes place shortly after moulting, when the exoskeleton is still soft, and usually occurs in the night. Courtship and mating may take up to 3 hours in &quot;Penaeus monodon&quot;, while in &quot;Farfantepenaeus paulensis&quot;, mating lasts just 4–5 seconds. Spawning may occur several times during the moulting cycle, and usually occurs at night.

With the exception of Luciferidae, the eggs of prawns are shed directly into the water, rather than being brooded. The eggs hatch into nauplius larvae, which are followed by zoea larvae (initially protozoea, and later mysis) and then a postlarva, before reaching adulthood. The changes between moults are gradual, and so the development is anamorphic rather than metamorphic.

Uniquely among the Decapoda, the nauplii of Dendrobranchiata are free-swimming. There are five to eight naupliar stages. The earlier stages have three pairs of appendages that are used for locomotion – two pairs of antennae and the mandibles. Later stages also have rudiments of other mouthparts, but the nauplius is unable to feed, and only lasts 24 to 68 hours. The body ends at a two-lobed telson, and the beginnings of a carapace emerge at this stage.

There are typically five or six zoea stages in Dendrobranchiata, divided into protozoea and mysis. In the protozoea larvae, the antennae are still used for locomotion, but the mandibles become specialised for mastication. All the thoracic somites (body segments) have formed, and a carapace is present, covering part of the thorax. It is smooth in the family Penaeidae, but bears many spines in the family Solenoceridae. The pleon (abdomen) is unsegmented in the first protozoea, and ends in a bilobed telson, which may be used for cleaning other appendages, or for steering. By the second protozoea, segmentation appears on the pleon, and by the third protozoea, which may also be called the metazoea, the uropods have appeared.

By the mysis stages, the pereiopods (thoracic appendages) start to be used instead of the antennae for locomotion. The larva swims backwards, with its tail upwards, spinning slowly as it goes. The carapace covers most of the segments of the thorax, and claws appear on the first three pereiopods. By the last mysis stage, the beginnings of pleopods have appeared on the first five segments of the abdomen.

The post-larva or juvenile stage is characterised by the use of the pleopods for locomotion. The claws become functional, but the gills are still rudimentary. The telson is narrower and only retains traces of its two-lobed development. Through a series of gradual changes over following moults, the animal takes on its adult form.

==Systematics==
Dendrobranchiata were traditionally grouped together with Caridea as &quot;Natantia&quot; (the swimming decapoda), as opposed to the Reptantia (the walking decapods). In 1888, Charles Spence Bate recognised the differences in gill morphology, and separated Natantia into Dendrobranchiata, Phyllobranchiata and Trichobranchiata. Recent analyses using cladistics and molecular phylogenetics recognise Dendrobranchiata as the sister group to all other Decapoda, collectively called Pleocyemata.

The cladogram below shows Dendrobranchiata&#x27;s placement within the larger order Decapoda, from analysis by Wolfe &quot;et al.&quot;, 2019.


Before 2010, the earliest known fossil prawns come from rocks in Madagascar of Permo-Triassic age, . In 2010, however, the discovery of &quot;Aciculopoda&quot; from Famennian–stage rocks in Oklahoma extended the group&#x27;s fossil record back to . The best known fossil prawns are from the Jurassic Solnhofen limestones from Germany.

Living prawns are divided among seven families, five in the superfamily Penaeoidea, and two in the Sergestoidea, although molecular evidence disagrees with some aspects of the current classifications. Collectively, these include 540 extant species, and nearly 100 exclusively fossil species. A further two families are known only from fossils.

The cladogram below shows Dendrobranchiata&#x27;s internal relationships of extant families (excluding Solenoceridae):

&lt;br&gt;
Dendrobranchiata comprises the following superfamilies and families:&lt;br&gt;
:Superfamily Penaeoidea 
::† Aciculopodidae – a single Famennian species, &quot;Aciculopoda mapesi&quot; 
::† Aegeridae – two Mesozoic genera: &quot;Aeger&quot; and &quot;Acanthochirana&quot; 
::Aristeidae – 26 extant species in 9 genera, and one fossil genus 
::Benthesicymidae – 41 species in 4 genera 
::† Carpopenaeidae – two Cretaceous species of &quot;Carpopenaeus&quot; 
::Penaeidae – 216 extant species in 26 genera, and several extinct genera, mostly Mesozoic 
::Sicyoniidae – 43 species of &quot;Sicyonia&quot; 
::Solenoceridae – 81 species in 9 genera 
:Superfamily Sergestoidea 
::Luciferidae – 7 species in 2 genera
::Sergestidae – 90 extant species in six genera, and two extinct monotypic genera 

==Distribution==
The biodiversity of Dendrobranchiata decreases markedly at increasing latitudes; most species are only found in a region between 40° north and 40° south. Some species may occur at higher latitudes. For instance, &quot;Bentheogennema borealis&quot; is abundant at 57° north in the Pacific Ocean, while collections of &quot;Gennadas kempi&quot; have been made as far south as 61° south in the Antarctic Ocean.

==Ecology and behaviour==

There is a great deal of ecological variation within the suborder Dendrobranchiata. Some species of Sergestidae live in fresh water, but most prawns are exclusively marine. Species of Sergestidae and Benthesicymidae mostly live in deep water, and Solenoceridae species live offshore, while most Penaeidae species live in shallow inshore waters, and &quot;Lucifer&quot; is planktonic. Some species burrow in mud on the sea floor during the day and emerge at night to feed.

Prawns are &quot;opportunistic omnivores&quot;, and their diet can include a range of food items from fine particles to large organisms. These may include fish, chaetognaths, krill, copepods, radiolarians, phytoplankton, nematocysts, ostracods and detritus. Prawns eat less around the time of ecdysis (moulting), probably because of the softness of the mouthparts, and must eat more than usual to compensate, once ecdysis is complete.

Prawns are an attractive food for predators, with a higher energy content than most other invertebrates. The larvae are prey to comb jellies, jellyfish, chaetognaths, fish and other crustaceans (such as mantis shrimp and crabs), and only a tiny proportion survive. Juveniles are targeted by a number of fish, cephalopods and birds; &quot;Litopenaeus vannamei&quot; juveniles experience 90% mortality in the 6–12 weeks they spend in Mexican lagoons, and this is thought to be due almost entirely to predation. Adult prawns are less susceptible to predation, but can fall prey to some fish.

==Economic importance==

Dendrobranchiata are of huge economic importance. While in some countries, such as the United States, production is almost entirely through fisheries, other countries have concentrated on aquaculture (shrimp farms), including Ecuador where 95% of production is farmed; some countries produce similar amounts from fisheries and aquaculture, including Mexico, China, India and Indonesia.

Species from the family Aristeidae are important to deep-water fisheries, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea, where &quot;Aristaeomorpha foliacea&quot; is caught by trawlers. In Brazil, &quot;Aristaeomorpha foliacea&quot;, &quot;Aristaeopsis edwardsiana&quot; and &quot;Aristeus antillensis&quot; are of commercial importance. The shallow-water Penaeidae are of greater importance, however, and the most important species for fisheries is &quot;Fenneropenaeus chinensis&quot;, with a catch in 2005 of over 100,000 tons.

The most important species for aquaculture are &quot;Marsupenaeus japonicus&quot; (Kuruma prawn), &quot;Fenneropenaeus chinensis&quot; (Chinese prawn), &quot;Penaeus monodon&quot; (giant tiger prawn) and &quot;Litopenaeus vannamei&quot; (whiteleg prawn).

<text>Natantia (Boas, 1880) is an obsolete taxon of decapod crustaceans, comprising those families that move predominantly by swimming – the shrimp (comprising Caridea and Procarididea), prawns (Dendrobranchiata) and boxer shrimp. The remaining Decapoda were placed in the Reptantia, and consisted of crabs, lobsters and other large animals that move chiefly by walking along the bottom. The division between Natantia and Reptantia was replaced in 1963, when Martin Burkenroad erected the suborder Pleocyemata for those animals that brood their eggs on the pleopods, leaving Dendrobranchiata for the prawns. Under this system, Natantia is a paraphyletic group. Burkenroad&#x27;s primary division of Decapoda into Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata has since been corroborated by molecular analyses.

The name Natantia Owen, 1851 was utilized in a phylogenetic context by Madzia and Cau (2017) as the most exclusive mosasaurid clade including &quot;Mosasaurus&quot; and &quot;Tylosaurus&quot; but not &quot;Halisaurus&quot;.

<doc id="52201" wikidata="Q742" url="?curid=52201" title="Jean Racine">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Racine ( , ; ; 22 December 1639 – 21 April 1699) was a French dramatist, one of the three great playwrights of 17th-century France, along with Molière and Corneille, as well as an important literary figure in the Western tradition and world literature. Racine was primarily a tragedian, producing such &quot;examples of neoclassical perfection&quot; as &quot;Phèdre&quot;, &quot;Andromaque&quot;, and &quot;Athalie&quot;. He did write one comedy, &quot;Les Plaideurs&quot;, and a muted tragedy, &quot;Esther&quot; for the young.

Racine&#x27;s plays displayed his mastery of the dodecasyllabic (12 syllable) French alexandrine. His writing is renowned for its elegance, purity, speed, and fury, and for what American poet Robert Lowell described as a &quot;diamond-edge&quot;, and the &quot;glory of its hard, electric rage&quot;. Racine&#x27;s dramaturgy is marked by his psychological insight, the prevailing passion of his characters, and the nakedness of both plot and stage.

==Biography==
Racine was born on 21 December 1639 in La Ferté-Milon (Aisne), in the province of Picardy in northern France. Orphaned by the age of four (his mother died in 1641 and his father in 1643), he came into the care of his grandparents. At the death of his grandfather in 1649, his grandmother, Marie des Moulins, went to live in the convent of Port-Royal and took her grandson with her. He received a classical education at the Petites écoles de Port-Royal, a religious institution which would greatly influence other contemporary figures including Blaise Pascal. Port-Royal was run by followers of Jansenism, a theology condemned as heretical by the French bishops and the Pope. Racine&#x27;s interactions with the Jansenists in his years at this academy would have great influence over him for the rest of his life. At Port-Royal, he excelled in his studies of the classics and the themes of Greek and Roman mythology would play large roles in his future works.

He was expected to study law at the &quot;Collège d&#x27;Harcourt&quot; in Paris, but instead found himself drawn to a more artistic lifestyle. Experimenting with poetry drew high praise from France&#x27;s greatest literary critic, Nicolas Boileau, with whom Racine would later become great friends; Boileau would often claim that he was behind the budding poet&#x27;s work. Racine eventually took up residence in Paris where he became involved in theatrical circles.

His first play, &quot;Amasie&quot;, never reached the stage. On 20 June 1664, Racine&#x27;s tragedy &quot;La Thébaïde ou les frères ennemis&quot; (&quot;The Thebans or the enemy Brothers&quot;) was produced by Molière&#x27;s troupe at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal, in Paris. The following year, Molière also put on Racine&#x27;s second play, &quot;Alexandre le Grand&quot;. However, this play garnered such good feedback from the public that Racine secretly negotiated with a rival play company, the Hôtel de Bourgogne, to perform the play – since they had a better reputation for performing tragedies. Thus, &quot;Alexandre&quot; premiered for the second time, by a different acting troupe, eleven days after its first showing. Molière could never forgive Racine for this betrayal, and Racine simply widened the rift between him and his former friend by seducing Molière&#x27;s leading actress, Thérèse du Parc, into becoming his companion both professionally and personally. From this point on the Hôtel de Bourgogne troupe performed all of Racine&#x27;s secular plays.

Though both &quot;La Thébaïde&quot; (1664) and its successor, &quot;Alexandre&quot; (1665), had classical themes, Racine was already entering into controversy and forced to field accusations that he was polluting the minds of his audiences. He broke all ties with Port-Royal, and proceeded with &quot;Andromaque&quot; (1667), which told the story of Andromache, widow of Hector, and her fate following the Trojan War. Amongst his rivals were Pierre Corneille and his brother, Thomas Corneille. Tragedians often competed with alternative versions of the same plot: for example, Michel le Clerc produced an &quot;Iphigénie&quot; in the same year as Racine (1674), and Jacques Pradon also wrote a play about &quot;Phèdre&quot; (1677). The success of Pradon&#x27;s work (the result of the activities of a claque) was one of the events which caused Racine to renounce his work as a dramatist at that time, even though his career up to this point was so successful that he was the first French author to live almost entirely on the money he earned from his writings. Others, including the historian Warren Lewis, attribute his retirement from the theater to qualms of conscience.

However, one major incident which seems to have contributed to Racine&#x27;s departure from public life was his implication in a court scandal of 1679. He got married at about this time to the pious Catherine de Romanet, and his religious beliefs and devotion to the Jansenist sect were revived. He and his wife eventually had two sons and five daughters. Around the time of his marriage and departure from the theatre, Racine accepted a position as a royal historiographer in the court of King Louis XIV, alongside his friend Boileau. He kept this position in spite of the minor scandals he was involved in. In 1672, he was elected to the &quot;Académie française&quot;, eventually gaining much power over this organisation. Two years later, he was given the title of &quot;treasurer of France&quot;, and he was later distinguished as an &quot;ordinary gentleman of the king&quot; (1690), and then as a secretary of the king (1696). Because of Racine&#x27;s flourishing career in the court, Louis XIV provided for his widow and children after his death. When at last he returned to the theatre, it was at the request of Madame de Maintenon, morganatic second wife of King Louis XIV, with the moral fables, &quot;Esther&quot; (1689) and &quot;Athalie&quot; (1691), both of which were based on Old Testament stories and intended for performance by the pupils of the school of the Maison royale de Saint-Louis in Saint-Cyr (a commune neighboring Versailles, and now known as &quot;Saint-Cyr l&#x27;École&quot;).

Jean Racine died in 1699 from cancer of the liver. He requested burial in Port-Royal, but after Louis XIV had this site razed in 1710, his remains were moved to the Saint-Étienne-du-Mont church in Paris.

==Style==
The quality of Racine&#x27;s poetry is perhaps his greatest contribution to French literature. His use of the alexandrine poetic line is considered exceptionally skilful.

Racine&#x27;s work faced many criticisms from his contemporaries. One was the lack of historic veracity in plays such as &quot;Britannicus&quot; (1669) and &quot;Mithridate&quot; (1673). Racine was quick to point out that his greatest critics – his rival dramatists – were among the biggest offenders in this respect. Another major criticism levelled at him was the lack of incident in his tragedy &quot;Bérénice&quot; (1670). Racine&#x27;s response was that the greatest tragedy does not necessarily consist in bloodshed and death.

===General characteristics===
Racine restricts his vocabulary to 2500 words. He rules out all workaday expressions since, although the Greeks could call a spade a spade, he does not believe that this is possible in Latin or French. The classical unities are strictly observed, for only the final stage of a prolonged crisis is described. The number of characters, all of them royal, is kept down to the barest minimum. Action on stage is all but eliminated. The mangled Hippolyte is not brought back, as is the &quot;Hippolytus&quot; of Euripides. The one exception to this is that Atalide stabs herself before the audience in &quot;Bajazet&quot;; but this is acceptable in a play conspicuous for its savagery and Oriental colour.

===Fundamental nature of tragedy===
Tragedy shows how men fall from prosperity to disaster. The higher the position from which the hero falls, the greater is the tragedy. Except for the confidants, of whom Narcisse (in &quot;Britannicus&quot;) and Œnone (in &quot;Phèdre&quot;) are the most significant, Racine describes the fate of kings, queens, princes and princesses, liberated from the constricting pressures of everyday life and able to speak and act without inhibition.

====Nature of Greek tragedy====
Greek tragedy, from which Racine borrowed so plentifully, tended to assume that humanity was under the control of gods indifferent to its sufferings and aspirations. In the &quot;Œdipus Tyrannus&quot; Sophocles&#x27;s hero becomes gradually aware of the terrible fact that, however hard his family has tried to avert the oracular prophecy, he has nevertheless killed his father and married his mother and must now pay the penalty for these unwitting crimes. The same awareness of a cruel fate that leads innocent men and women into sin and demands retribution of the equally innocent children, pervades &quot;La Thébaïde&quot;, a play that itself deals with the legend of Œdipus.

====Racine’s tragic vision====
Racine is often said to have been deeply influenced by the Jansenist sense of fatalism. However, the link between Racine&#x27;s tragedy and Jansenism has been disputed on multiple grounds; for example, Racine himself denied any connection to Jansenism. As a Christian, Racine could no longer assume, as did Æschylus and Sophocles, that God is merciless in leading men to a doom which they do not foresee. Instead, destiny becomes (at least, in the secular plays) the uncontrollable frenzy of unrequited love.

As already in the works of Euripides, the gods have become more symbolic. Venus represents the unquenchable force of sexual passion within the human being in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Hippolytus&quot;; but closely allied to this – indeed, indistinguishable from it – is the atavistic strain of monstrous aberration that had caused her mother Pasiphaë to mate with a bull and give birth to the Minotaur.

Thus, in Racine the &quot;hamartia&quot;, which the thirteenth chapter of Aristotle’s &quot;Poetics&quot; had declared a characteristic of tragedy, is not merely an action performed in all good faith which subsequently has the direst consequences (Œdipus&#x27;s killing a stranger on the road to Thebes, and marrying the widowed Queen of Thebes after solving the Sphinx&#x27;s riddle), nor is it simply an error of judgment (as when Deianira, in the &quot;Hercules Furens&quot; of Seneca the Younger, kills her husband when intending to win back his love); it is a flaw of character.

====Racine’s concept of love====
In a second important respect, Racine is at variance with the Greek pattern of tragedy. His tragic characters are aware of, but can do nothing to overcome, the blemish which leads them on to a catastrophe. And the tragic recognition, or &quot;anagnorisis&quot;, of wrongdoing is not confined, as in the &quot;Œdipus Tyrannus&quot;, to the end of the play, when the fulfilment of the prophecy is borne in upon Œdipus; Phèdre realizes from the very beginning the monstrousness of her passion, and preserves throughout the play a lucidity of mind that enables her to analyse and reflect upon this fatal and hereditary weakness. Hermione&#x27;s situation is rather closer to that of Greek tragedy. Her love for Pyrrhus is perfectly natural and is not in itself a flaw of character. But despite her extraordinary lucidity (II 1; V 1) in analysing her violently fluctuating states of mind, she is blind to the fact that the King does not really love her (III 3), and this weakness on her part, which leads directly to the tragic &quot;peripeteia&quot; of III 7, is the &quot;hamartia&quot; from which the tragic outcome arises.

For Racine, love closely resembles a physiological disorder. It is a fatal illness with alternating moods of calm and crisis, and with deceptive hopes of recovery or fulfilment (&quot;Andromaque&quot;, ll. 1441–1448; &quot;Phèdre&quot;, ll. 767-768), the final remission culminating in a quick death. His main characters are monsters, and stand out in glaring contrast to the regularity of the plays&#x27; structure and versification. The suffering lover Hermione, Roxane or Phèdre is aware of nothing except her suffering and the means whereby it can be relieved. Her love is not founded upon esteem of the beloved and a concern for his happiness and welfare, but is essentially selfish. In a torment of jealousy, she tries to relieve the &quot;pangs of despised love&quot; by having (or, in Phèdre&#x27;s case, allowing) him to be put to death, and thus associating him with her own suffering. The depth of tragedy is reached when Hermione realizes that Pyrrhus&#x27;s love for Andromaque continues beyond the grave, or when Phèdre contrasts the young lovers&#x27; purity with her unnaturalness which should be hidden from the light of day. Racine&#x27;s most distinctive contribution to literature is his conception of the ambivalence of love: &quot;ne puis-je savoir si j&#x27;aime, ou si je hais?&quot;

The passion of these lovers is totally destructive of their dignity as human beings, and usually kills them or deprives them of their reason. Except for Titus and Bérénice, they are blinded by it to all sense of duty. Pyrrhus casts off his fiancée in order to marry a slave from an enemy country, for whom he is prepared to repudiate his alliances with the Greeks. Orestes&#x27; duties as an ambassador are subordinate to his aspirations as a lover, and he finally murders the king to whom he has been sent. Néron&#x27;s passion for Junie causes him to poison Britannicus and thus, after two years of virtuous government, to inaugurate a tyranny.

The characteristic Racinian framework is that of the eternal triangle: two young lovers, a prince and a princess, being thwarted in their love by a third person, usually a queen whose love for the young prince is unreciprocated. Phèdre destroys the possibility of a marriage between Hippolyte and Aricie. Bajazet and Atalide are prevented from marrying by the jealousy of Roxane. Néron divides Britannicus from Junie. In &quot;Bérénice&quot; the amorous couple are kept apart by considerations of state. In &quot;Andromaque&quot; the system of unrequited passions borrowed from tragicomedy alters the dramatic scheme, and Hermione destroys a man who has been her fiancé, but who has remained indifferent to her, and is now marrying a woman who does not love him. The young princes and princesses are agreeable, display varying degrees of innocence and optimism and are the victims of evil machinations and the love/hatred characteristic of Racine.

===The major roles in Racinian tragedy===
The king (Pyrrhus, Néron, Titus, Mithridate, Agamemnon, Thésée) holds the power of life and death over the other characters. Pyrrhus forces Andromaque to choose between marrying him and seeing her son killed. After keeping his fiancée waiting in Epirus for a year, he announces his intention of marrying her, only to change his mind almost immediately afterwards. Mithridate discovers Pharnace&#x27;s love for Monime by spreading a false rumour of his own death. By pretending to renounce his fiancée, he finds that she had formerly loved his other son Xipharès. Wrongly informed that Xipharès has been killed fighting Pharnace and the Romans, he orders Monime to take poison. Dying, he unites the two lovers. Thésée is a rather nebulous character, primarily important in his influence upon the mechanism of the plot. Phèdre declares her love to Hippolyte on hearing the false news of his death. His unexpected return throws her into confusion and lends substance to Œnone&#x27;s allegations. In his all-too-human blindness, he condemns to death his own son on a charge of which he is innocent. Only Amurat does not actually appear on stage, and yet his presence is constantly felt. His intervention by means of the letter condemning Bajazet to death (IV 3) precipitates the catastrophe.

The queen shows greater variations from play to play than anyone else, and is always the most carefully delineated character. Hermione (for she, rather than the pathetic and emotionally stable Andromaque, has a rôle equivalent to that generally played by the queen) is young, with all the freshness of a first and only love; she is ruthless in using Oreste as her instrument of vengeance; and she is so cruel in her brief moment of triumph that she refuses to intercede for Astyanax&#x27;s life. Agrippine, an ageing and forlorn woman, &quot;fille, femme, sœur et mère de vos maîtres&quot;, who has stopped at nothing in order to put her own son on the throne, vainly tries to reassert her influence over Néron by espousing the cause of a prince whom she had excluded from the succession. Roxane, the fiercest and bravest in Racine&#x27;s gallery of queens, has no compunction in ordering Bajazet&#x27;s death and indeed banishes him from her presence even before he has finished justifying himself. Clytemnestre is gentle and kind, but quite ineffectual in rescuing her daughter Iphigénie from the threat of sacrifice. Phèdre, passive and irresolute, allows herself to be led by Œnone; deeply conscious of the impurity of her love, she sees it as an atavistic trait and a punishment of the gods; and she is so consumed by jealousy that she can do nothing to save her beloved from the curse.

The confidants&#x27; primary function is to make monologues unnecessary. Only very rarely do they further the action. They invariably reflect the character of their masters and mistresses. Thus, Narcisse and Burrhus symbolize the warring elements of evil and good within the youthful Néron. But Narcisse is more than a reflection: he betrays and finally poisons his master Britannicus. Burrhus, on the other hand, is the conventional &quot;good angel&quot; of the medieval morality play. He is a much less colourful character than his opposite number. Œnone, Phèdre&#x27;s evil genius, persuades her mistress to tell Hippolyte of her incestuous passion, and incriminates the young prince on Thésée&#x27;s unexpected return. Céphise, knowing how deeply attached Pyrrhus is to her mistress, urges the despairing Andromaque to make a last appeal to him on her son&#x27;s behalf, and so changes the course of the play.

===Observance of the dramatic unities===
Racine observes the dramatic unities more closely than the Greek tragedians had done. The philosopher Aristotle points out the ways in which tragedy differs from epic poetry:

&quot;Tragedy generally tries to limit its action to a period of twenty-four hours, or not much exceeding that, whilst epic poetry is unlimited in point of time.&quot;

Writing centuries after the great Attic tragedians and using their works as a basis for generalization, he does not insist that the action of a tragedy must be confined to a single revolution of the sun, or that it must take place in one locality. He merely says that this limitation was often practised by writers of tragedy, but he well knew that there were many plays in which no such limitation existed. For instance, Æschylus&#x27;s &quot;Agamemnon&quot; compresses into about fifteen minutes a journey (from Troy to Argos) which must have taken several days.

Nor was the unity of place a general feature of Attic tragedy. Æschylus&#x27;s &quot;The Eumenides&quot; has two settings and in &quot;The Suppliants&quot; of Euripides, it is sometimes impossible to tell where the action is taking place at all. But the circumstances of the Greek theatre, which had no curtain and no distinctive scenery and in which the chorus almost always remained on stage throughout the play, were such that it was frequently desirable to confine the action to a single day and a single place.

The only rule which Aristotle lays down concerning the dramatic action is that, in common with all other forms of art, a tragedy must have an internal unity, so that every part of it is in an organic relationship to the whole and no part can be changed or left out without detracting from the economy of the play. No dramatic critic has ever dissented from this &quot;unity of action&quot;; but the unities of time and place were in fact read into the &quot;Poetics&quot; by theoreticians of the New Learning (Jean de La Taille) and other writers (Jean Vauquelin de la Fresnaye and Jean Mairet). The support which the unities received from Cardinal Richelieu eventually secured their complete triumph and Pierre Corneille, who had not conformed to them in his earlier plays, did so from the time of &quot;Le Cid&quot; (1636) onwards. But even he found them a tiresome imposition. Only by a very ready suspension of disbelief can we accept that in the space of twenty-four hours El Cid kills Chimène&#x27;s father in a duel, overwhelms the Moorish invaders during the night and fights a second duel only a few hours after the enemy has fled. These discrepancies – and others besides, which Corneille admits to in his &quot;Examen&quot; of the play – are obvious even to the most inattentive spectator.

Unlike his rival, who crams into his plays &quot;quantité d&#x27;incidents qui ne se pourraient passer qu&#x27;en un mois&quot;, Racine describes fluctuating states of mind which, in the rapidly mounting tension, are brought abruptly to a crisis from which there is no retreat. The so-called Aristotelian rules happen to suit this type of drama perfectly since they lead the playwright to concentrate the tragic action on those few hours when, after months or years of emotional tension, a new event supervenes and precipitates the catastrophe.

The most striking evidence of Racine&#x27;s success in fitting his tragedies into this very stringent framework is that, when watching them, the audience ceases to be aware that the unities exist. Not long before he wrote &quot;Phèdre&quot;, the same subject had been dealt with by Gabriel Gilbert and Mathieu Bidar, both of whom had kept Hippolyte off stage after Act IV. Racine, on the other hand, brings him into Act V scene 1, the last line of which is only seventy or eighty lines earlier than Théramène&#x27;s récit in V 6. In the four minutes which these lines take to recite the young prince has gone out with Théramène, has met, fought and been killed by the monster, and Théramène has come back to announce his master&#x27;s death. Furthermore, Aricie only leaves the stage at the end of V 3, and therefore in the space of two short scenes has met her dying lover on the seashore and has taken her leave of him! These chronological inconsistencies pass unnoticed in the theatre.

Racine invariably observes the unity of place. A room in Pyrrhus&#x27;s palace at Buthrotum; an antechamber separating the apartments of Titus and Bérénice in Rome; Agamemnon&#x27;s camp at Aulis; an antechamber in the temple at Jerusalem: by choosing such vague and remote settings Racine gives his plays a universal character, and the presentation of conflicting and hesitating states of mind is not hampered by an undue insistence on material surroundings. At times, of course, the unity of place leads to slightly far-fetched meetings: why, for instance, does Pyrrhus come to see Oreste (Act I Sc. 2), rather than the other way around, except to conform to this rule? Lastly, the unity of place necessitates the récit and this again is in complete harmony with Racine&#x27;s fundamental aims: how would &quot;Andromaque&quot; gain by our being able to see Pyrrhus and his bride approach and enter the temple? The important fact is the effect of Cléone&#x27;s words upon Hermione. Oreste&#x27;s relating to Hermione the murder of Pyrrhus is the supreme irony of the play. Théramène&#x27;s récit describes, in the most memorable and poetic language, an event which would be infinitely less moving if it were to be seen it imperfectly represented upon the stage.

As regards the unity of action, Racine differs sharply from William Shakespeare in excluding minor plots (compare the parallel themes of blind and unnatural fatherhood and the retribution it invokes, in &quot;King Lear&quot;) and in ruling out the comic element. The fact that Act II scene 5 of &quot;Andromaque&quot; or many of the scenes of &quot;Alexandre le Grand&quot; and &quot;Mithridate&quot; have comic undertones is beside the point. Will Andromaque agree to marry Pyrrhus? Will Agamemnon sacrifice Iphigénie? Can Esther persuade her husband to spare the Jews? The plots of &quot;Bajazet&quot;, &quot;Phèdre&quot; and &quot;Athalie&quot; are scarcely more complex than the rest.

====Tempo of Racinian tragedy====
Unlike such plays as &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;, in which a dramatic first scene precedes the exposition, a Racinian tragedy opens very quietly, but even so in a mood of suspense. In &quot;Andromaque&quot; Pyrrhus&#x27;s unenviable wavering between Hermione and the eponymous heroine has been going on for a year and has exasperated all three. Up to the time when &quot;Britannicus&quot; begins, Néron has been a good ruler, a faithful disciple of Seneca and Burrhus, and a dutiful son; but he is now beginning to show a spirit of independence. With the introduction of a new element (Oreste&#x27;s demand that Astyanax should be handed over to the Greeks; Junie&#x27;s abduction; Abner&#x27;s unconscious disclosure that the time to proclaim Joas has finally come), an already tense situation becomes, or has become, critical. In a darkening atmosphere, a succession of fluctuating states of mind on the part of the main characters brings us to the resolution – generally in the fourth Act, but not always (&quot;Bajazet&quot;, &quot;Athalie&quot;) – of what by now is an unbearable discordance. Hermione entrusts the killing of Pyrrhus to Oreste; wavers for a moment when the King comes into her presence; then, condemns him with her own mouth. No sooner has Burrhus regained his old ascendancy over Néron, and reconciled him with his half-brother, than Narcisse most skilfully overcomes the emperor&#x27;s scruples of conscience and sets him on a career of vice of which Britannicus&#x27;s murder is merely the prelude. By the beginning of Act IV of &quot;Phèdre&quot;, Œnone has besmirched Hippolyte&#x27;s character, and the Queen does nothing during that Act to exculpate him. With the working-out of a situation usually decided by the end of Act IV, the tragedies move to a swift conclusion.

===Treatment of sources===
In the religious plays, Racine is fairly scrupulous in adhering to his Old Testament sources, taking care to put into the mouth of Joad (the Second Jehoiada) only those prophetic utterances that are to be found in the Bible. Nevertheless, he takes advantage of a verse in II &quot;Chronicles&quot; XXIV attributing the gift of prophecy to Joad&#x27;s son Zacharie (Zechariah ben Jehoiada) in order to suppose that the father (whom the Bible does not describe as a prophet) likewise had prophetic powers. And thinking a child of seven – the age of Joas (Jehoash of Judah) in the Second &quot;Book of Kings&quot; – too young to have the part given him in &quot;Athalie&quot;, Racine makes him into a boy of nine or ten on the evidence of the Septuagint version of II &quot;Chronicles&quot; XXIII 1.

In the secular plays, he takes far greater liberties. The frequently conflicting sources of Greek and Roman mythology enable him to fashion the plot he thinks suitable to his characters and, above all, to present the old stories in a modern light. Whereas Euripides, in his &quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot;, averts the heroine&#x27;s death only by causing Artemis to spirit her away to Tauris, putting a hart in her place on the sacrificial altar. Racine, determined to avoid the miraculous, borrows from a minor Greek writer, the geographer Pausanias, the character of Ériphile. The disclosure that Iphigénie&#x27;s treacherous rival was herself called Iphigeneia at birth and should be sacrificed in the heroine&#x27;s place prevents a tragic outcome.

In creating Andromaque, Racine believes he must &quot;[se] conformer à l&#x27;idée que nous avons maintenant de cette princesse&quot;. Astyanax, whom Euripides describes (in &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; and the &quot;Andromache&quot;) as having been thrown from the walls of Troy and killed, and whose death is foreshadowed in book 24 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, is made to survive the capture of Troy and the extinction of his dynasty. In another respect also, Racine departs from the lines laid down by the &quot;Andromache&quot;, for whereas in the earlier play the heroine fears that the son she has had by Pyrrhus may suffer death if she refuses to marry the father, the later heroine fears for the life of a legitimate son. The reason for these changes in the Homeric and Euripidean traditions is obvious: if Andromaque had been Pyrrhus&#x27;s mistress (as in Euripides), why should she refuse to marry him? Racine, like Homer, conceives her as sublimely faithful to Hector; yet the tension (III 8) between maternal love and a reluctance to marry Pyrrhus must (as in Euripides) be paramount. And so Astyanax is brought back to life.

&quot;Phèdre&quot; differs from Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Hippolytus&quot; and Seneca the Younger&#x27;s &quot;Phædra&quot; in the very important respect that, taking the character of Aricie from Virgil, Racine introduces the jealousy motive. Despite the fact that Hippolyte, &quot;ce fils chaste et respectueux&quot;, is indifferent to her, Phèdre will not consent to Œnone&#x27;s suggesting to Thésée that the son has made improper advances to the stepmother – until (IV 5) she discovers that he has loved Aricie all along.

==Criticism==
Racine&#x27;s works have evoked in audiences and critics a wide range of responses, ranging from reverence to revulsion. In his book &quot;Racine: A Study&quot; (1974), Philip Butler of the University of Wisconsin broke the main criticisms of Racine down by century to show the almost constantly shifting perception of the playwright and his works.

===17th century===
In his own time, Racine found himself compared constantly with his contemporaries, especially the great Pierre Corneille. In his own plays, Racine sought to abandon the ornate and almost otherworldly intricacy that Corneille so favored. Audiences and critics were divided over the worth of Racine as an up-and-coming playwright. Audiences admired his return to simplicity and their ability to relate to his more human characters, while critics insisted on judging him according to the traditional standards of Aristotle and his Italian commentators from which he tended to stray. Attitudes shifted, however, as Racine began to eclipse Corneille. In 1674, the highly respected poet and critic Boileau published his &quot;Art Poétique&quot; which deemed Racine&#x27;s model of tragedy superior to that of Corneille. This erased all doubts as to Racine&#x27;s abilities as a dramatist and established him as one of the period&#x27;s great literary minds.

Butler describes this period as Racine&#x27;s &quot;apotheosis,&quot; his highest point of admiration. Racine&#x27;s ascent to literary fame coincided with other prodigious cultural and political events in French history. This period saw the rise of literary giants like Molière, Jean de La Fontaine, Boileau, and François de La Rochefoucauld, as well as Louis Le Vau&#x27;s historic expansion of the Palace of Versailles, Jean-Baptiste Lully&#x27;s revolution in Baroque music, and most importantly, the ascension of Louis XIV to the throne of France.

During Louis XIV&#x27;s reign, France rose up from a long period of civil discord (see the Fronde) to new heights of international prominence. Political achievement coincided with cultural and gave birth to an evolution of France&#x27;s national identity, known as &quot;l&#x27;esprit français.&quot; This new self-perception acknowledged the superiority of all things French; the French believed France was home to the greatest king, the greatest armies, the greatest people, and, subsequently, the greatest culture. In this new national mindset, Racine and his work were practically deified, established as the perfect model of dramatic tragedy by which all other plays would be judged. Butler blames the consequential &quot;withering&quot; of French drama on Racine&#x27;s idolized image, saying that such rigid adherence to one model eventually made all new French drama a stale imitation.

===19th century===
The French installation of Racine into the dramatic and literary pantheon evoked harsh criticism from many sources who argued against his &#x27;perfection.&#x27; Germans like Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe dismissed Racine as &quot;höfisches Drama,&quot; or &quot;courtly drama&quot; too restricted by the &quot;étiquette&quot; and conventions of a royal court for the true expression of human passion. French critics, too, revolted. Racine came to be dismissed as merely &quot;an historical document&quot; that painted a picture only of 17th century French society and nothing else; there could be nothing new to say about him. However, as writers like Charles Baudelaire and Gustave Flaubert came onto the scene to soundly shake the foundations of French literature, conservative readers retreated to Racine for the nostalgia of his simplicity.

As Racine returned to prominence at home, his critics abroad remained hostile due mainly, Butler argues, to Francophobia. The British were especially damning, preferring Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott to Racine, whom they dismissed as &quot;didactic&quot; and &quot;commonplace.&quot; This did not trouble the French, however, as &quot;Racine, La Fontaine, or generally speaking the &quot;chefs-d&#x27;œuvre de l&#x27;esprit humain&quot; could not be understood by foreigners.&quot;

===20th century===
The 20th century saw a renewed effort to rescue Racine and his works from the chiefly historical perspective to which he had been consigned. Critics called attention to the fact that plays such as &quot;Phèdre&quot; could be interpreted as realist drama, containing characters that were universal and that could appear in any time period. Other critics cast new light upon the underlying themes of violence and scandal that seem to pervade the plays, creating a new angle from which they could be examined. In general, people agreed that Racine would only be fully understood when removed from the context of the 18th century. Jean-Yves Tadié noted that Marcel Proust developed a fondness for Racine at an early age, &quot;whom he considered a brother and someone very much like himself...&quot;

In his essay, &quot;The Theatre and Cruelty&quot;, Antonin Artaud claimed that &#x27;the misdeeds of the psychological theater descended from Racine have made us unaccustomed to that immediate and violent action which the theater should possess&#x27; (p. 84).

===21st century===

At present, Racine is still widely considered a literary genius of revolutionary proportions. His work is still widely read and frequently performed. Racine&#x27;s influence can be seen in A.S. Byatt&#x27;s tetralogy (&quot;The Virgin in the Garden 1978, Still Life 1985, Babel Tower 1997 and A Whistling Woman 2002&quot;). Byatt tells the story of Frederica Potter, an English young woman in the early 1950s (when she is first introduced), who is very appreciative of Racine, and specifically of &quot;Phedre&quot;.

==Translations==

The linguistic effects of Racine&#x27;s poetry are widely considered to be untranslatable, although many eminent poets have attempted to translate Racine&#x27;s work into English, including Lowell, Richard Wilbur, Ted Hughes, Tony Harrison, and Derek Mahon. Friedrich Schiller translated Racine into the German language, and Monsignor Pádraig de Brún into the Irish language.

Racine&#x27;s plays have been translated into English by Robert David MacDonald, Alan Hollinghurst (&quot;Berenice&quot;, &quot;Bajazet&quot;), by RADA director Edward Kemp (&quot;Andromache&quot;), Neil Bartlett, and poet Geoffrey Alan Argent, who earned a 2011 American Book Award for the translating &quot;The Complete Plays of Jean Racine&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, especially historical and recreational mathematics, a square array of numbers, usually positive integers, is called a magic square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same. The &quot;order&quot; of the magic square is the number of integers along one side (&quot;n&quot;), and the constant sum is called the &quot;magic constant&quot;. If the array includes just the positive integers formula_1, the magic square is said to be &quot;normal&quot;. Some authors take &quot;magic square&quot; to mean &quot;normal magic square&quot;.

Magic squares that include repeated entries do not fall under this definition and are referred to as &quot;trivial&quot;. Some well-known examples, including the Sagrada Família magic square and the Parker square, are trivial in this sense. When all the rows and columns but not both diagonals sum to the magic constant, this gives a semimagic square (sometimes called orthomagic square).

The mathematical study of a magic square typically deals with its construction, classification, and enumeration. Although completely general methods for producing all the magic squares of all orders do not exist, historically three general techniques have been discovered: by bordering method, by making composite magic squares, and by adding two preliminary squares. There are also more specific strategies like the continuous enumeration method that reproduces specific patterns. Magic squares are generally classified according to their order &quot;n&quot; as: odd if &quot;n&quot; is odd, evenly even (also referred to as &quot;doubly even&quot;) if &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of 4, oddly even (also known as &quot;singly even&quot;) if &quot;n&quot; is any other even number. This classification is based on different techniques required to construct odd, evenly even, and oddly even squares. Beside this, depending on further properties, magic squares are also classified as associative magic squares, pandiagonal magic squares, most-perfect magic squares, and so on. More challengingly, attempts have also been made to classify all the magic squares of a given order as transformations of a smaller set of squares. Except for &quot;n&quot; ≤ 5, the enumeration of higher order magic squares is still an open challenge. The enumeration of most-perfect magic squares of any order was only accomplished in the late 20th century.

Magic squares have a long history, dating back to at least 190 BCE in China. At various times they have acquired occult or mythical significance, and have appeared as symbols in works of art. In modern times they have been generalized a number of ways, including using extra or different constraints, multiplying instead of adding cells, using alternate shapes or more than two dimensions, and replacing numbers with shapes and addition with geometric operations.

==History==

The third-order magic square was known to Chinese mathematicians as early as 190 BCE, and explicitly given by the first century of the common era. The first dateable instance of the fourth-order magic square occurred in 587 CE in India. Specimens of magic squares of order 3 to 9 appear in an encyclopedia from Baghdad , the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot; (&quot;Rasa&#x27;il Ikhwan al-Safa&quot;). By the end of 12th century, the general methods for constructing magic squares were well established. Around this time, some of these squares were increasingly used in conjunction with magic letters, as in Shams Al-ma&#x27;arif, for occult purposes. In India, all the fourth-order pandiagonal magic squares were enumerated by Narayana in 1356. Magic squares were made known to Europe through translation of Arabic sources as occult objects during the Renaissance, and the general theory had to be re-discovered independent of prior developments in China, India, and Middle East. Also notable are the ancient cultures with a tradition of mathematics and numerology that did not discover the magic squares: Greeks, Babylonians, Egyptians, and Pre-Columbian Americans.

===Chinese===
While ancient references to the pattern of even and odd numbers in the 3×3 magic square appear in the &quot;I Ching&quot;, the first unequivocal instance of this magic square appears in the chapter called &quot;Mingtang&quot; (Bright Hall) of a 1st-century book &quot;Da Dai Liji&quot; (Record of Rites by the Elder Dai), which purported to describe ancient Chinese rites of the Zhou dynasty. 
 These numbers also occur in a possibly earlier mathematical text called &quot;Shushu jiyi&quot; (Memoir on Some Traditions of Mathematical Art), said to be written in 190 BCE. This is the earliest appearance of a magic square on record; and it was mainly used for divination and astrology. The 3×3 magic square was referred to as the &quot;Nine Halls&quot; by earlier Chinese mathematicians. The identification of the 3×3 magic square to the legendary Luoshu chart was only made in the 12th century, after which it was referred to as the Luoshu square. The oldest surviving Chinese treatise that displays magic squares of order larger than 3 is Yang Hui&#x27;s &quot;Xugu zheqi suanfa&quot; (Continuation of Ancient Mathematical Methods for Elucidating the Strange) written in 1275. The contents of Yang Hui&#x27;s treatise were collected from older works, both native and foreign; and he only explains the construction of third and fourth-order magic squares, while merely passing on the finished diagrams of larger squares. He gives a magic square of order 3, two squares for each order of 4 to 8, one of order nine, and one semi-magic square of order 10. He also gives six magic circles of varying complexity.








The above magic squares of orders 3 to 9 are taken from Yang Hui&#x27;s treatise, in which the Luo Shu principle is clearly evident. The order 5 square is a bordered magic square, with central 3×3 square formed according to Luo Shu principle. The order 9 square is a composite magic square, in which the nine 3×3 sub squares are also magic. After Yang Hui, magic squares frequently occur in Chinese mathematics such as in Ding Yidong&#x27;s &quot;Dayan suoyin&quot; (), Cheng Dawei&#x27;s &quot;Suanfa tongzong&quot; (1593), Fang Zhongtong&#x27;s &quot;Shuduyan&quot; (1661) which contains magic circles, cubes and spheres, Zhang Chao&#x27;s &quot;Xinzhai zazu&quot; (), who published China&#x27;s first magic square of order ten, and lastly Bao Qishou&#x27;s &quot;Binaishanfang ji&quot; (), who gave various three dimensional magic configurations. However, despite being the first to discover the magic squares and getting a head start by several centuries, the Chinese development of the magic squares are much inferior compared to the Indian, Middle Eastern, or European developments. The high point of Chinese mathematics that deals with the magic squares seems to be contained in the work of Yang Hui; but even as a collection of older methods, this work is much more primitive, lacking general methods for constructing magic squares of any order, compared to a similar collection written around the same time by the Byzantine scholar Manuel Moschopoulos. This is possibly because of the Chinese scholars&#x27; enthralment with the Lo Shu principle, which they tried to adapt to solve higher squares; and after Yang Hui and the fall of Yuan dynasty, their systematic purging of the foreign influences in Chinese mathematics.

===Japan===
Japan and China have similar mathematical traditions and have repeatedly influenced each other in the history of magic squares. The Japanese interest in magic squares began after the dissemination of Chinese works—Yang Hui&#x27;s &quot;Suanfa&quot; and Cheng Dawei&#x27;s &quot;Suanfa tongzong&quot;—in the 17th century, and as a result, almost all the &quot;wasans&quot; devoted their time to its study.

In the 1660 edition of &quot;Ketsugi-sho&quot;, Isomura Kittoku gave both odd and even ordered bordered magic squares as well as magic circles; while the 1684 edition of the same book contained a large section on magic squares, demonstrating that he had a general method for constructing bordered magic squares. In &quot;Jinko-ki&quot; (1665) by Muramatsu Kudayu Mosei, both magic squares and magic circles are displayed. The largest square Mosei constructs is of 19th order. Various magic squares and magic circles were also published by Nozawa Teicho in &quot;Dokai-sho&quot; (1666), Sato Seiko in &quot;Kongenki&quot; (1666), and Hosino Sanenobu in &quot;Ko-ko-gen Sho&quot; (1673). One of Seki Takakazu&#x27;s &quot;Seven Books&quot; (&quot;Hojin Yensan&quot;) (1683) is devoted completely to magic squares and circles. This is the first Japanese book to give a general treatment of magic squares in which the algorithms for constructing odd, singly even and doubly even bordered magic squares are clearly described. In 1694 and 1695, Yueki Ando gave different methods to create the magic squares and displayed squares of order 3 to 30. A fourth-order magic cube was constructed by Yoshizane Tanaka (1651–1719) in &quot;Rakusho-kikan&quot; (1683). The study of magic squares was continued by Seki&#x27;s pupils, notably by Katahiro Takebe, whose squares were displayed in the fourth volume of &quot;Ichigen Kappo&quot; by Shukei Irie, Yoshisuke Matsunaga in &quot;Hojin-Shin-jutsu&quot;, Yoshihiro Kurushima in &quot;Kyushi Iko&quot; who rediscovered a method to produce the odd squares given by Agrippa, and Naonobu Ajima. Thus by the beginning of the 18th century, the Japanese mathematicians were in possession of methods to construct magic squares of arbitrary order. After this, attempts at enumerating the magic squares was initiated by Nushizumi Yamaji.

===India===

The 3×3 magic square first appears in India in &quot;Gargasamhita&quot; by Garga, who recommends its use to pacify the nine planets (&quot;navagraha&quot;). The oldest version of this text dates from 100 CE, but the passage on planets could not have been written earlier than 400 CE. The first dateable instance of 3×3 magic square in India occur in a medical text &quot;Siddhayog&quot; () by Vrnda, which was prescribed to women in labor in order to have easy delivery.

The oldest dateable fourth order magic square in the world is found in an encyclopaedic work written by Varahamihira around 587 CE called &quot;Brhat Samhita&quot;. The magic square is constructed for the purpose of making perfumes using 4 substances selected from 16 different substances. Each cell of the square represents a particular ingredient, while the number in the cell represents the proportion of the associated ingredient, such that the mixture of any four combination of ingredients along the columns, rows, diagonals, and so on, gives the total volume of the mixture to be 18. Although the book is mostly about divination, the magic square is given as a matter of combinatorial design, and no magical properties are attributed to it. The special features of this magic square were commented on by Bhattotpala ()


The square of Varahamihira as given above has sum of 18. Here the numbers 1 to 8 appear twice in the square. It is a pan-diagonal magic square. Four different magic squares can be obtained by adding 8 to one of the two sets of 1 to 8 sequence. The sequence is selected such that the number 8 is added exactly twice in each row, each column and each of the main diagonals. One of the possible magic squares shown in the right side. This magic square is remarkable in that it is a 90 degree rotation of a magic square that appears in the 13th century Islamic world as one of the most popular magic squares.

The construction of 4th-order magic square is detailed in a work titled &quot;Kaksaputa&quot;, composed by the alchemist Nagarjuna around 10th century CE. All of the squares given by Nagarjuna are 4×4 magic squares, and one of them is called &quot;Nagarjuniya&quot; after him. Nagarjuna gave a method of constructing 4×4 magic square using a primary skeleton square, given an odd or even magic sum. The Nagarjuniya square is given below, and has the sum total of 100.


The Nagarjuniya square is a pan-diagonal magic square. The Nagarjuniya square is made up of two arithmetic progressions starting from 6 and 16 with eight terms each, with a common difference between successive terms as 4. When these two progressions are reduced to the normal progression of 1 to 8, the adjacent square is obtained.

Around 12th-century, a 4×4 magic square was inscribed on the wall of Parshvanath temple in Khajuraho, India. Several Jain hymns teach how to make magic squares, although they are undateable.

As far as is known, the first systematic study of magic squares in India was conducted by Thakkar Pheru, a Jain scholar, in his &quot;Ganitasara Kaumudi&quot; (c. 1315). This work contains a small section on magic squares which consists of nine verses. Here he gives a square of order four, and alludes to its rearrangement; classifies magic squares into three (odd, evenly even, and oddly even) according to its order; gives a square of order six; and prescribes one method each for constructing even and odd squares. For the even squares, Pheru divides the square into component squares of order four, and puts the numbers into cells according to the pattern of a standard square of order four. For odd squares, Pheru gives the method using horse move or knight&#x27;s move. Although algorithmically different, it gives the same square as the De la Loubere&#x27;s method.

The next comprehensive work on magic squares was taken up by Narayana Pandit, who in the fourteenth chapter of his &quot;Ganita Kaumudi&quot; (1356) gives general methods for their construction, along with the principles governing such constructions. It consists of 55 verses for rules and 17 verses for examples. Narayana gives a method to construct all the pan-magic squares of fourth order using knight&#x27;s move; enumerates the number of pan-diagonal magic squares of order four, 384, including every variation made by rotation and reflection; three general methods for squares having any order and constant sum when a standard square of the same order is known; two methods each for constructing evenly even, oddly even, and of squares when the sum is given. While Narayana describes one older method for each species of square, he claims the method of superposition for evenly even and odd squares and a method of interchange for oddly even squares to be his own invention. The superposition method was later re-discovered by De la Hire in Europe. In the last section, he conceives of other figures, such as circles, rectangles, and hexagons, in which the numbers may be arranged to possess properties similar to those of magic squares. Below are some of the magic squares constructed by Narayana:





The order 8 square is interesting in itself since it is an instance of the most-perfect magic square. Incidentally, Narayana states that the purpose of studying magic squares is to construct &quot;yantra&quot;, to destroy the ego of bad mathematicians, and for the pleasure of good mathematicians. The subject of magic squares is referred to as &quot;bhadraganita&quot; and Narayana states that it was first taught to men by god Shiva.

===Middle East, North Africa, Muslim Iberia===

Although the early history of magic squares in Persia and Arabia is not known, it has been suggested that they were known in pre-Islamic times. It is clear, however, that the study of magic squares was common in medieval Islam, and it was thought to have begun after the introduction of chess into the region. The first dateable appearance of a magic square of order 3 occurs in Jābir ibn Hayyān&#x27;s (fl. c. 721 – c. 815) &quot;Kitab al-mawazin al-Saghir&quot; (The Small Book of Balances) where the magic square and its related numerology is associated with alchemy. While it is known that treatises on magic squares were written in the 9th century, the earliest extant treaties date from the 10th-century: one by Abu&#x27;l-Wafa al-Buzjani () and another by Ali b. Ahmad al-Antaki (). These early treatises were purely mathematical, and the Arabic designation for magic squares used is &quot;wafq al-a&#x27;dad&quot;, which translates as &quot;harmonious disposition of the numbers&quot;. By the end of 10th century, the two treatises by Buzjani and Antaki makes it clear that the Middle Eastern mathematicians had understood how to construct bordered squares of any order as well as simple magic squares of small orders (&quot;n&quot; ≤ 6) which were used to make composite magic squares. A specimen of magic squares of orders 3 to 9 devised by Middle Eastern mathematicians appear in an encyclopedia from Baghdad , the Rasa&#x27;il Ikhwan al-Safa (the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot;). The squares of order 3 to 7 from Rasa&#x27;il are given below:






The 11th century saw the finding of several ways to construct simple magic squares for odd and evenly-even orders; the more difficult case of evenly-odd case (&quot;n = 4k + 2&quot;) was solved by Ibn al-Haytham with &quot;k&quot; even (c. 1040), and completely by the beginning of 12th century, if not already in the latter half of the 11th century. Around the same time, pandiagonal squares were being constructed. Treaties on magic squares were numerous in the 11th and 12th century. These later developments tended to be improvements on or simplifications of existing methods. From the 13th century, magic squares were increasingly put to occult purposes. However, much of these later texts written for occult purposes merely depict certain magic squares and mention their attributes, without describing their principle of construction, with only some authors keeping the general theory alive. One such occultist was the Algerian Ahmad al-Buni (c. 1225), who gave general methods on constructing bordered magic squares; some others were the 17th century Egyptian Shabramallisi and the 18th century Nigerian al-Kishnawi.

The magic square of order three was described as a child-bearing charm since its first literary appearances in the alchemical works of Jābir ibn Hayyān (fl. c. 721 – c. 815) and al-Ghazālī (1058–1111) and it was preserved in the tradition of the planetary tables. The earliest occurrence of the association of seven magic squares to the virtues of the seven heavenly bodies appear in Andalusian scholar Ibn Zarkali&#x27;s (known as Azarquiel in Europe) (1029–1087) &quot;Kitāb tadbīrāt al-kawākib&quot; (&quot;Book on the Influences of the Planets&quot;). A century later, the Algerian scholar Ahmad al-Buni attributed mystical properties to magic squares in his highly influential book &quot;Shams al-Ma&#x27;arif&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Sun of Gnosis and the Subtleties of Elevated Things&quot;), which also describes their construction. This tradition about a series of magic squares from order three to nine, which are associated with the seven planets, survives in Greek, Arabic, and Latin versions. There are also references to the use of magic squares in astrological calculations, a practice that seems to have originated with the Arabs.

===Latin Europe===

Unlike in Persia and Arabia, better documentation exists of how the magic squares were transmitted to Europe. Around 1315, influenced by Arab sources, the Greek Byzantine scholar Manuel Moschopoulos wrote a mathematical treatise on the subject of magic squares, leaving out the mysticism of his Middle Eastern predecessors, where he gave two methods for odd squares and two methods for evenly even squares. Moschopoulos was essentially unknown to the Latin Europe until the late 17th century, when Philippe de la Hire rediscovered his treatise in the Royal Library of Paris. However, he was not the first European to have written on magic squares; and the magic squares were disseminated to rest of Europe through Spain and Italy as occult objects. The early occult treaties that displayed the squares did not describe how they were constructed. Thus the entire theory had to be rediscovered.

Magic squares had first appeared in Europe in &quot;Kitāb tadbīrāt al-kawākib&quot; (&quot;Book on the Influences of the Planets&quot;) written by Ibn Zarkali of Toledo, Al-Andalus, as planetary squares by 11th century. The magic square of three was discussed in numerological manner in early 12th century by Jewish scholar Abraham ibn Ezra of Toledo, which influenced later Kabbalists. Ibn Zarkali&#x27;s work was translated as &quot;Libro de Astromagia&quot; in the 1280s, due to Alfonso X of Castille. In the Alfonsine text, magic squares of different orders are assigned to the respective planets, as in the Islamic literature; unfortunately, of all the squares discussed, the Mars magic square of order five is the only square exhibited in the manuscript.

Magic squares surface again in Florence, Italy in the 14th century. A 6×6 and a 9×9 square are exhibited in a manuscript of the &quot;Trattato d&#x27;Abbaco&quot; (Treatise of the Abacus) by Paolo Dagomari. It is interesting to observe that Paolo Dagomari, like Pacioli after him, refers to the squares as a useful basis for inventing mathematical questions and games, and does not mention any magical use. Incidentally, though, he also refers to them as being respectively the Sun&#x27;s and the Moon&#x27;s squares, and mentions that they enter astrological calculations that are not better specified. As said, the same point of view seems to motivate the fellow Florentine Luca Pacioli, who describes 3×3 to 9×9 squares in his work &quot;De Viribus Quantitatis&quot; by the end of 15th century.

===Europe after 15th century===

The planetary squares had disseminated into northern Europe by the end of 15th century. For instance, the Cracow manuscript of &quot;Picatrix&quot; from Poland displays magic squares of orders 3 to 9. The same set of squares as in the Cracow manuscript later appears in the writings of Paracelsus in &quot;Archidoxa Magica&quot; (1567), although in highly garbled form. In 1514 Albrecht Dürer immortalized a 4×4 square in his famous engraving &quot;Melencolia I.&quot; Paracelsus&#x27; contemporary Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim published his famous three volume book &quot;De occulta philosophia&quot; in 1531, where he devoted Chapter 22 of Book II to the planetary squares shown below. The same set of squares given by Agrippa reappear in 1539 in &quot;Practica Arithmetice&quot; by Girolamo Cardano, where he explains the construction of the odd ordered squares using &quot;diamond method&quot;, which was later reproduced by Bachet. The tradition of planetary squares was continued into the 17th century by Athanasius Kircher in &quot;Oedipi Aegyptici&quot; (1653). In Germany, mathematical treaties concerning magic squares were written in 1544 by Michael Stifel in&quot; Arithmetica Integra&quot;, who rediscovered the bordered squares, and Adam Riese, who rediscovered the continuous numbering method to construct odd ordered squares published by Agrippa. However, due to the religious upheavals of that time, these works were unknown to the rest of Europe.






In 1624 France, Claude Gaspard Bachet described the &quot;diamond method&quot; for constructing Agrippa&#x27;s odd ordered squares in his book &quot;Problèmes Plaisants&quot;. During 1640 Bernard Frenicle de Bessy and Pierre Fermat exchanged letters on magic squares and cubes, and in one of the letters Fermat boasts of being able to construct 1,004,144,995,344 magic squares of order 8 by his method. An early account on the construction of bordered squares was given by Antoine Arnauld in his &quot;Nouveaux éléments de géométrie&quot; (1667). In the two treatise &quot;Des quarrez ou tables magiques&quot; and &quot;Table générale des quarrez magiques de quatre de côté&quot;, published posthumously in 1693, twenty years after his death, Bernard Frenicle de Bessy demonstrated that there were exactly 880 distinct magic squares of order four. Frenicle gave methods to construct magic square of any odd and even order, where the even ordered squares were constructed using borders. He also showed that interchanging rows and columns of a magic square produced new magic squares. In 1691, Simon de la Loubère described the Indian continuous method of constructing odd ordered magic squares in his book &quot;Du Royaume de Siam&quot;, which he had learned while returning from a diplomatic mission to Siam, which was faster than Bachet&#x27;s method. In an attempt to explain its working, de la Loubere used the primary numbers and root numbers, and rediscovered the method of adding two preliminary squares. This method was further investigated by Abbe Poignard in &quot;Traité des quarrés sublimes&quot; (1704), by Philippe de La Hire in &quot;Mémoires de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences&quot; for the Royal Academy (1705), and by Joseph Sauveur in &quot;Construction des quarrés magiques&quot; (1710). Concentric bordered squares were also studied by De la Hire in 1705, while Sauveur introduced magic cubes and lettered squares, which was taken up later by Euler in 1776, who is often credited for devising them. In 1750 d&#x27;Ons-le-Bray rediscovered the method of constructing doubly even and singly even squares using bordering technique; while in 1767 Benjamin Franklin published a semi-magic square that had the properties of eponymous Franklin square. By this time the earlier mysticism attached to the magic squares had completely vanished, and the subject was treated as a part of recreational mathematics.

In the 19th century, Bernard Violle gave a comprehensive treatment of magic squares in his three volume &quot;Traité complet des carrés magiques&quot; (1837–1838), which also described magic cubes, parallelograms, parallelopipeds, and circles. Pandiagonal squares were extensively studied by Andrew Hollingworth Frost, who learned it while in the town of Nasik, India, (thus calling them Nasik squares) in a series of articles: &quot;On the knight&#x27;s path&quot; (1877), &quot;On the General Properties of Nasik Squares&quot; (1878), &quot;On the General Properties of Nasik Cubes&quot; (1878), &quot;On the construction of Nasik Squares of any order&quot; (1896). He showed that it is impossible to have normal singly-even pandiagonal magic squares. Frederick A.P. Barnard constructed inlaid magic squares and other three dimensional magic figures like magic spheres and magic cylinders in &quot;Theory of magic squares and of magic cubes&quot; (1888). In 1897, Emroy McClintock published &quot;On the most perfect form of magic squares&quot;, coining the words &quot;pandiagonal square&quot; and &quot;most perfect square&quot;, which had previously been referred to as perfect, or diabolic, or Nasik.

==Some famous magic squares==
===Luo Shu magic square===

Legends dating from as early as 650 BCE tell the story of the Lo Shu (洛書) or &quot;scroll of the river Lo&quot;. According to the legend, there was at one time in ancient China a huge flood. While the great king Yu was trying to channel the water out to sea, a turtle emerged from it with a curious pattern on its shell: a 3×3 grid in which circular dots of numbers were arranged, such that the sum of the numbers in each row, column and diagonal was the same: 15. According to the legend, thereafter people were able to use this pattern in a certain way to control the river and protect themselves from floods. The Lo Shu Square, as the magic square on the turtle shell is called, is the unique normal magic square of order three in which 1 is at the bottom and 2 is in the upper right corner. Every normal magic square of order three is obtained from the Lo Shu by rotation or reflection.

===Magic square in Parshavnath temple===

There is a well-known 12th-century 4×4 normal magic square inscribed on the wall of the Parshvanath temple in Khajuraho, India.

This is known as the &quot;Chautisa Yantra&quot; (&quot;Chautisa&quot;, 34; &quot;&quot;, lit. &quot;device&quot;), since its magic sum is 34. It is one of the three 4×4 pandiagonal magic squares and is also an instance of the most-perfect magic square. The study of this square led to the appreciation of pandiagonal squares by European mathematicians in the late 19th century. Pandiagonal squares were referred to as Nasik squares or Jain squares in older English literature.

===Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s magic square===

The order four normal magic square Albrecht Dürer immortalized in his 1514 engraving &quot;Melencolia I&quot;, referred to above, is believed to be the first seen in European art. The square associated with Jupiter appears as a talisman used to drive away melancholy. It is very similar to Yang Hui&#x27;s square, which was created in China about 250 years before Dürer&#x27;s time. As with every order 4 normal magic square, the magic sum is 34. But in the Durer square this sum is also found 
in each of the quadrants, in the center four squares, and in the corner squares (of the 4×4 as well as the four contained 3×3 grids). This sum can also be found in the four outer numbers clockwise from the corners (3+8+14+9) and likewise the four counter-clockwise (the locations of four queens in the two solutions of the 4 queens puzzle), the two sets of four symmetrical numbers (2+8+9+15 and 3+5+12+14), the sum of the middle two entries of the two outer columns and rows (5+9+8+12 and 3+2+15+14), and in four kite or cross shaped quartets (3+5+11+15, 2+10+8+14, 3+9+7+15, and 2+6+12+14). The two numbers in the middle of the bottom row give the date of the engraving: 1514. It has been speculated that the numbers 4,1 bordering the publication date correspond to Durer&#x27;s initials D,A. But if that had been his intention, he could have inverted the order of columns 1 and 4 to achieve &quot;A1514D&quot; without compromising the square&#x27;s properties. 

Dürer&#x27;s magic square can also be extended to a magic cube.

===Sagrada Família magic square===
The Passion façade of the Sagrada Família church in Barcelona, conceptualized by Antoni Gaudí and designed by sculptor Josep Subirachs, features a trivial order 4 magic square: The magic constant of the square is 33, the age of Jesus at the time of the Passion. Structurally, it is very similar to the Melancholia magic square, but it has had the numbers in four of the cells reduced by 1.
Trivial squares such as this one are not generally mathematically interesting and only have historical significance. Lee Sallows has pointed out that, due to Subirachs&#x27;s ignorance of magic square theory, the renowned sculptor made a needless blunder, and supports this assertion by giving several examples of non-trivial 4×4 magic squares showing the desired magic constant of 33.

Similarly to Dürer&#x27;s magic square, the Sagrada Familia&#x27;s magic square can also be extended to a magic cube.

===Parker square===
The Parker square, named after recreational mathematician Matt Parker, is an attempt to create a 33 magic square of squares — a prized unsolved problem since Euler. The Parker square is a trivial semimagic square since it uses some numbers more than once, and the diagonal sums to , not as for all the other rows and columns, and the other diagonal.

===Gardner square===
The Gardner square, named after recreational mathematician Martin Gardner, similar to the Parker square,
is given as a problem to determine a, b, c and d.

This solution for a = 74, b = 113, c = 94 and d = 97 gives a semimagic square; the diagonal sums to , not as for all the other rows and columns, and the other diagonal.
==Properties of magic squares==
===Magic constant===

The constant that is the sum of any row, or column, or diagonal is called the magic constant or magic sum, &quot;M.&quot; Every normal magic square has a constant dependent on the order , calculated by the formula formula_2. This can be demonstrated by noting that the sum of formula_1 is formula_4. Since the sum of each row is formula_5, the sum of formula_6 rows is formula_7, which when divided by the order yields the magic constant as formula_2. For normal magic squares of orders &quot;n&quot; = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, the magic constants are, respectively: 15, 34, 65, 111, 175, and 260 (sequence in the OEIS).

===Magic square of order 1 is trivial===
The 1×1 magic square, with only one cell containing the number 1, is called &quot;trivial&quot;, because it is typically not under consideration when discussing magic squares; but it is indeed a magic square by definition, if a single cell is regarded as a square of order one.

===Magic square of order 2 cannot be constructed===
Normal magic squares of all sizes can be constructed except 2×2 (that is, where order &quot;n&quot; = 2).

===Center of mass===
If the numbers in the magic square are seen as masses located in various cells, then the center of mass of a magic square coincides with its geometric center.

===Moment of inertia===
The &quot;moment of inertia&quot; of a magic square has been defined as the sum over all cells of the number in the cell times the squared distance from the center of the cell to the center of the square; here the unit of measurement is the width of one cell. (Thus for example a corner cell of a 3×3 square has a distance of formula_9 a non-corner edge cell has a distance of 1, and the center cell has a distance of 0.) Then all magic squares of a given order have the same moment of inertia as each other. For the order-3 case the moment of inertia is always 60, while for the order-4 case the moment of inertia is always 340. In general, for the &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; case the moment of inertia is formula_10

===Birkhoff–von Neumann decomposition===
Dividing each number of the magic square by the magic constant will yield a doubly stochastic matrix, whose row sums and column sums equal to unity. However, unlike the doubly stochastic matrix, the diagonal sums of such matrices will also equal to unity. Thus, such matrices constitute a subset of doubly stochastic matrix. The Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem states that for any doubly stochastic matrix formula_11, there exists real numbers formula_12, where formula_13 and permutation matrices formula_14 such that

:formula_15

This representation may not be unique in general. By Marcus-Ree theorem, however, there need not be more than formula_16 terms in any decomposition. Clearly, this decomposition carries over to magic squares as well, since a magic square can be recovered from a doubly stochastic matrix by multiplying it by the magic constant.

==Classification of magic squares==
While the classification of magic squares can be done in many ways, some useful categories are given below. An &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; square array of integers 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;2 is called:
* &quot;Semi-magic square&quot; when its rows and columns sum to give the magic constant.
* &quot;Simple magic square&quot; when its rows, columns, and two diagonals sum to give magic constant and no more. They are also known as &quot;ordinary magic squares&quot; or &quot;normal magic squares&quot;.
* &quot;Self-complementary magic square&quot; when it is a magic square which when complemented (i.e. each number subtracted from &quot;n&quot;2 + 1) will give a rotated or reflected version of the original magic square.
* &quot;Associative magic square&quot; when it is a magic square with a further property that every number added to the number equidistant, in a straight line, from the center gives &quot;n&quot;2 + 1. They are also called &quot;symmetric magic squares&quot;. Associative magic squares do not exist for squares of singly even order. All associative magic square are self-complementary magic squares as well.
* &quot;Pandiagonal magic square&quot; when it is a magic square with a further property that the broken diagonals sum to the magic constant. They are also called &quot;panmagic squares&quot;, &quot;perfect squares&quot;, &quot;diabolic squares&quot;, &quot;Jain squares&quot;, or &quot;Nasik squares&quot;. Panmagic squares do not exist for singly even orders. However, singly even non-normal squares can be panmagic. 
* &quot;Ultra magic square&quot; when it is both associative and pandiagonal magic square. Ultra magic square exist only for orders &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5.
* &quot;Bordered magic square&quot; when it is a magic square and it remains magic when the rows and columns on the outer edge are removed. They are also called &quot;concentric bordered magic squares&quot; if removing a border of a square successively gives another smaller bordered magic square. Bordered magic square do not exist for order 4.
* &quot;Composite magic square&quot; when it is a magic square that is created by &quot;multiplying&quot; (in some sense) smaller magic squares, such that the order of the composite magic square is a multiple of the order of the smaller squares. Such squares can usually be partitioned into smaller non-overlapping magic sub-squares. 
* &quot;Inlaid magic square&quot; when it is a magic square inside which a magic sub-square is embedded, regardless of construction technique. The embedded magic sub-squares are themselves referred to as &quot;inlays&quot;.
* &quot;Most-perfect magic square&quot; when it is a pandiagonal magic square with two further properties (i) each 2×2 subsquare add to 1/&quot;k&quot; of the magic constant where &quot;n&quot; = 4&quot;k&quot;, and (ii) all pairs of integers distant &quot;n&quot;/2 along any diagonal (major or broken) are complementary (i.e. they sum to &quot;n&quot;2 + 1). The first property is referred to as &quot;compactness&quot;, while the second property is referred to as &quot;completeness&quot;. Most-perfect magic squares exist only for squares of doubly even order. All the pandiagonal squares of order 4 are also most perfect.
* &quot;Franklin magic square&quot; when it is a doubly even magic square with three further properties (i) every bent diagonal adds to the magic constant, (ii) every half row and half column starting at an outside edge adds to half the magic constant, and (iii) the square is &quot;compact&quot;.
* &quot;Multimagic square&quot; when it is a magic square that remains magic even if all its numbers are replaced by their &quot;k&quot;-th power for 1 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;P&quot;. They are also known as &quot;P-multimagic square&quot; or &quot;satanic squares&quot;. They are also referred to as &quot;bimagic squares&quot;, &quot;trimagic squares&quot;, &quot;tetramagic squares&quot;, and &quot;pentamagic squares&quot; when the value of &quot;P&quot; is 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively.

==Enumeration of magic squares==
;Low-order squares
There is only one (trivial) magic square of order 1 and no magic square of order 2. As mentioned above, the set of normal squares of order three constitutes a single equivalence class-all equivalent to the Lo Shu square. Thus there is basically just one normal magic square of order 3.

The number of different &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; magic squares for &quot;n&quot; from 1 to 6, not counting rotations and reflections is:
: 1, 0, 1, 880, 275305224, 17753889197660635632. 
The number for &quot;n&quot; = 6 had previously been estimated to be 

; Magic tori
Cross-referenced to the above sequence, a new classification enumerates the magic tori that display these magic squares. The number of magic tori of order &quot;n&quot; from 1 to 5, is: 
: 1, 0, 1, 255, 251449712 .

; Higher-order squares and tori

The number of distinct normal magic squares rapidly increases for higher orders.

The 880 magic squares of order 4 are displayed on 255 magic tori of order 4 and the 275,305,224 squares of order 5 are displayed on 251,449,712 magic tori of order 5. The numbers of magic tori and distinct normal squares are not yet known for orders beyond 5 and 6, respectively.

Algorithms tend to only generate magic squares of a certain type or classification, making counting all possible magic squares quite difficult. Since traditional counting methods have proven unsuccessful, statistical analysis using the Monte Carlo method has been applied. The basic principle applied to magic squares is to randomly generate &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices of elements 1 to &quot;n&quot;2 and check if the result is a magic square. The probability that a randomly generated matrix of numbers is a magic square is then used to approximate the number of magic squares.

More intricate versions of the Monte Carlo method, such as the exchange Monte Carlo, and Monte Carlo backtracking have produced even more accurate estimations. Using these methods it has been shown that the probability of magic squares decreases rapidly as n increases. Using fitting functions give the curves seen to the right.

==Transformations that preserve the magic property==
===For any magic square===
* The sum of any two magic squares of the same order by matrix addition is a magic square.
* A magic square remains magic when all of its numbers undergo the same linear transformation (i.e., a function of the form ). For example, a magic square remains magic when its numbers are multiplied by any constant. Moreover, a magic square remains magic when a constant is added or subtracted to its numbers, or if its numbers are subtracted from a constant. In particular, if every element in a normal magic square of order formula_6 is subtracted from formula_18, the complement of the original square is obtained. In the example below, each element of the magic square on the left is subtracted from 17 to obtain the complement magic square on the right.



* A magic square remains magic when transformed by any element of , the symmetry group of a square (see ). Every combination of one or more rotations of 90 degrees, reflections, or both produce eight trivially distinct squares which are generally considered equivalent. The eight such squares are said to make up a single equivalence class. The eight equivalent magic squares for the 3×3 magic square are shown below:






* A magic square of order formula_6 remains magic when both its rows and columns are symmetrically permuted by formula_20 such that formula_21 for formula_22. Every permutation of the rows or columns preserves all row and column sums, but generally not the two diagonal sums. If the same permutation formula_20 is applied to both the rows and columns, then diagonal element in row formula_24 and column formula_24 is mapped to row formula_26 and column formula_26 which is on the same diagonal; therefore, applying the same permutation to rows and columns preserves the main (upper left to lower right) diagonal sum. If the permutation is symmetric as described, then the diagonal element in row formula_24 and column formula_29 is mapped to row formula_26 and column formula_31 which is on the same diagonal; therefore, applying the same symmetric permutation to both rows and columns preserves both diagonal sums. For even formula_6, there are formula_33 such symmetric permutations, and formula_34 for formula_6 odd. In the example below, the original magic square on the left has its rows and columns symmetrically permuted by formula_36 resulting in the magic square on the right.


* A magic square of order formula_6 remains magic when rows formula_24 and formula_39 are exchanged and columns formula_24 and formula_39 are exchanged because this is a symmetric permutation of the form described above. In the example below, the square on the right is obtained by interchanging the 1st and 4th rows and columns of the original square on the left.


* A magic square of order formula_6 remains magic when rows formula_24 and formula_44 are exchanged, rows formula_39 and formula_46 are exchanged, columns formula_24 and formula_44 are exchanged, and columns formula_39 and formula_46 are exchanged where formula_51 because this is another symmetric permutation of the form described above. In the example below, the left square is the original square, while the right square is the new square obtained by this transformation. In the middle square, rows 1 and 2 and rows 3 and 4 have been swapped. The final square on the right is obtained by interchanging columns 1 and 2 and columns 3 and 4 of the middle square. In this particular example, this transform rotates the quadrants 180 degrees. The middle square is also magic because the original square is associative.


* A magic square remains magic when its quadrants are diagonally interchanged because this is another symmetric permutation of the form described above. For even-order formula_6, permute the rows and columns by permutation formula_20 where formula_54 for formula_55, and formula_56 for formula_57. For odd-order formula_6, permute rows and columns by permutation formula_20 where formula_60 for formula_61, and formula_62 for formula_63. For odd ordered square, the halves of the central row and column are also interchanged. Examples for order 4 and 5 magic squares are given below:



===For associative magic squares===
* An associative magic square remains associative when two rows or columns equidistant from the center are interchanged. For an even square, there are &quot;n&quot;/2 pairs of rows or columns that can be interchanged; thus 2&quot;n&quot;/2 × 2&quot;n&quot;/2 = 2&quot;n&quot; equivalent magic squares by combining such interchanges can be obtained. For odd square, there are (&quot;n&quot; − 1)/2 pairs of rows or columns that can be interchanged; and 2&quot;n&quot;−1 equivalent magic squares obtained by combining such interchanges. Interchanging all the rows flips the square vertically (i.e. reflected along the horizontal axis), while interchanging all the columns flips the square horizontally (i.e. reflected along the vertical axis). In the example below, a 4×4 associative magic square on the left is transformed into a square on the right by interchanging the second and third row, yielding the famous Durer&#x27;s magic square.


* An associative magic square remains associative when two same sided rows (or columns) are interchanged along with corresponding other sided rows (or columns). For an even square, since there are &quot;n&quot;/2 same sided rows (or columns), there are &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot; - 2)/8 pairs of such rows (or columns) that can be interchanged. Thus, 2&quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot;-2)/8 × 2&quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot;-2)/8 = 2&quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot;-2)/4 equivalent magic squares can be obtained by combining such interchanges. For odd square, since there are (&quot;n&quot; - 1)/2 same sided rows or columns, there are (&quot;n&quot; - 1)(&quot;n&quot; - 3)/8 pairs of such rows or columns that can be interchanged. Thus, there are 2(&quot;n&quot; - 1)(&quot;n&quot; - 3)/8 × 2(&quot;n&quot; - 1)(&quot;n&quot; - 3)/8 = 2(&quot;n&quot; - 1)(&quot;n&quot; - 3)/4 equivalent magic squares obtained by combining such interchanges. Interchanging all the same sided rows flips each quadrants of the square vertically, while interchanging all the same sided columns flips each quadrant of the square horizontally. In the example below, the original square is on the left, whose rows 1 and 2 are interchanged with each other, along with rows 3 and 4, to obtain the transformed square on the right.


* An associative magic square remains associative when its entries are replaced with corresponding numbers from a set of &quot;s&quot; arithmetic progressions with the same common difference among &quot;r&quot; terms, such that &quot;r&quot; × &quot;s&quot; = &quot;n&quot;2, and whose initial terms are also in arithmetic progression, to obtain a non-normal magic square. Here either &quot;s&quot; or &quot;r&quot; should be a multiple of &quot;n&quot;. Let us have &quot;s&quot; arithmetic progressions given by
::formula_64
:where &quot;a&quot; is the initial term, &quot;c&quot; is the common difference of the arithmetic progressions, and &quot;d&quot; is the common difference among the initial terms of each progression. The new magic constant will be 
::formula_65
:If &quot;s&quot; = &quot;r&quot; = &quot;n&quot;, then follows the simplification
::formula_66
:With &quot;a&quot; = &quot;c&quot; = 1 and &quot;d&quot; = &quot;n&quot;, the usual &quot;M&quot; = &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2+1)/2 is obtained. For given &quot;M&quot; the required &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; can be found by solving the linear Diophantine equation. In the examples below, there are order 4 normal magic squares on the left most side. The second square is a corresponding non-normal magic square with &quot;r&quot; = 8, &quot;s&quot; = 2, &quot;a&quot; = 1, &quot;c&quot; = 1, and &quot;d&quot; = 10 such that the new magic constant is &quot;M&quot; = 38. The third square is an order 5 normal magic square, which is a 90 degree clockwise rotated version of the square generated by De la Loubere method. On the right most side is a corresponding non-normal magic square with &quot;a&quot; = 4, &quot;c&quot; = 1, and &quot;d&quot; = 6 such that the new magic constant is &quot;M&quot; = 90. 



===For pan-diagonal magic squares===
* A pan-diagonal magic square remains a pan-diagonal magic square under cyclic shifting of rows or of columns or both. This allows us to position a given number in any one of the &quot;n&quot;2 cells of an &quot;n&quot; order square. Thus, for a given pan-magic square, there are &quot;n&quot;2 equivalent pan-magic squares. In the example below, the original square on the left is transformed by shifting the first row to the bottom to obtain a new pan-magic square in the middle. Next, the 1st and 2nd column of the middle pan-magic square is circularly shifted to the right to obtain a new pan-magic square on the right.



===For bordered magic squares===
* A bordered magic square remains a bordered magic square after permuting the border cells in the rows or columns, together with their corresponding complementary terms, keeping the corner cells fixed. Since the cells in each row and column of every concentric border can be permuted independently, when the order &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5 is odd, there are formula_67 equivalent bordered squares. When &quot;n&quot; ≥ 6 is even, there are formula_68 equivalent bordered squares. In the example below, a square of order 5 is given whose border row has been permuted and (3!)2 = 36 such equivalent squares can be obtained.


* A bordered magic square remains a bordered magic square after each of its concentric borders are independently rotated or reflected with respect to the central core magic square. If there are &quot;b&quot; borders, then this transform will yield 8&quot;b&quot; equivalent squares. In the example below of the 5×5 magic square, the border has been rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise.



===For composite magic squares===
* A composite magic square remains a composite magic square when the embedded magic squares undergo transformations that do not disturb the magic property (e.g. rotation, reflection, shifting of rows and columns, and so on).

==Special methods of construction==
Over the millennia, many ways to construct magic squares have been discovered. These methods can be classified as general methods and special methods, in the sense that general methods allow us to construct more than a single magic square of a given order, whereas special methods allow us to construct just one magic square of a given order. Special methods are specific algorithms whereas general methods may require some trial-and-error.

Special methods are the most simple ways to construct magic squares. They follow certain algorithms which generate regular patterns of numbers in a square. The correctness of these special methods can be proved using one of the general methods given in later sections. After a magic square has been constructed using a special method, the transformations described in the previous section can be applied to yield further magic squares. Special methods are usually referred to using the name of the author(s) (if known) who described the method, for e.g. De la Loubere&#x27;s method, Starchey&#x27;s method, Bachet&#x27;s method, etc.

Magic squares are believed to exist for all orders, except for order 2. Magic squares can be classified according to their order as odd, doubly even (&quot;n&quot; divisible by four), and singly even (&quot;n&quot; even, but not divisible by four). This classification is based on the fact that entirely different techniques need to be employed to construct these different species of squares. Odd and doubly even magic squares are easy to generate; the construction of singly even magic squares is more difficult but several methods exist, including John Horton Conway&#x27;s LUX method for magic squares and the Strachey method for magic squares.

===A method for constructing a magic square of order 3===
In the 19th century, Édouard Lucas devised the general formula for order 3 magic squares. Consider the following table made up of positive integers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;:

These nine numbers will be distinct positive integers forming a magic square with the magic constant 3&quot;c&quot; so long as 0 &lt; &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; &lt; &quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≠ 2&quot;a&quot;. Moreover, every 3×3 magic square of distinct positive integers is of this form.

In 1997 Lee Sallows discovered that leaving aside rotations and reflections, then every distinct parallelogram drawn on the Argand diagram defines a unique 3×3 magic square, and vice versa, a result that had never previously been noted.

===A method for constructing a magic square of odd order===
A method for constructing magic squares of odd order was published by the French diplomat de la Loubère in his book, &quot;A new historical relation of the kingdom of Siam&quot; (Du Royaume de Siam, 1693), in the chapter entitled &quot;The problem of the magical square according to the Indians&quot;. The method operates as follows:

The method prescribes starting in the central column of the first row with the number 1. After that, the fundamental movement for filling the squares is diagonally up and right, one step at a time. If a square is filled with a multiple of the order &quot;n&quot;, one moves vertically down one square instead, then continues as before. When an &quot;up and to the right&quot; move would leave the square, it is wrapped around to the last row or first column, respectively.








Starting from other squares rather than the central column of the first row is possible, but then only the row and column sums will be identical and result in a magic sum, whereas the diagonal sums will differ. The result will thus be a semimagic square and not a true magic square. Moving in directions other than north east can also result in magic squares.




===A method of constructing a magic square of doubly even order===
Doubly even means that &quot;n&quot; is an even multiple of an even integer; or 4&quot;p&quot; (e.g. 4, 8, 12), where &quot;p&quot; is an integer.

Generic pattern
All the numbers are written in order from left to right across each row in turn, starting from the top left hand corner. Numbers are then either retained in the same place or interchanged with their diametrically opposite numbers in a certain regular pattern. In the magic square of order four, the numbers in the four central squares and one square at each corner are retained in the same place and the others are interchanged with their diametrically opposite numbers.

A construction of a magic square of order 4 
Starting from top left, go left to right through each row of the square, counting each cell from 1 to 16 and filling the cells along the diagonals with its corresponding number. Once the bottom right cell is reached, continue by going right to left, starting from the bottom right of the table through each row, and fill in the non-diagonal cells counting up from 1 to 16 with its corresponding number. As shown below:


An extension of the above example for Orders 8 and 12
First generate a pattern table, where a &#x27;1&#x27; indicates selecting from the square where the numbers are written in order 1 to n2 (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), and a &#x27;0&#x27; indicates selecting from the square where the numbers are written in reverse order &quot;n&quot;2 to 1. For &quot;M&quot; = 4, the pattern table is as shown below (third matrix from left). With the unaltered cells (cells with &#x27;1&#x27;) shaded, a criss-cross pattern is obtained.




The patterns are a) there are equal number of &#x27;1&#x27;s and &#x27;0&#x27;s in each row and column; b) each row and each column are &quot;palindromic&quot;; c) the left- and right-halves are mirror images; and d) the top- and bottom-halves are mirror images (c and d imply b). The pattern table can be denoted using hexadecimals as (9, 6, 6, 9) for simplicity (1-nibble per row, 4 rows). The simplest method of generating the required pattern for higher ordered doubly even squares is to copy the generic pattern for the fourth-order square in each four-by-four sub-squares.

For M = 8, possible choices for the pattern are (99, 66, 66, 99, 99, 66, 66, 99); (3C, 3C, C3, C3, C3, C3, 3C, 3C); (A5, 5A, A5, 5A, 5A, A5, 5A, A5) (2-nibbles per row, 8 rows).




For M = 12, the pattern table (E07, E07, E07, 1F8, 1F8, 1F8, 1F8, 1F8, 1F8, E07, E07, E07) yields a magic square (3-nibbles per row, 12 rows.) It is possible to count the number of choices one has based on the pattern table, taking rotational symmetries into account.

==Method of superposition==
The earliest discovery of the superposition method was made by the Indian mathematician Narayana in the 14th century. The same method was later re-discovered and studied in early 18th century Europe by de la Loubere, Poignard, de La Hire, and Sauveur; and the method is usually referred to as de la Hire&#x27;s method. Although Euler&#x27;s work on magic square was unoriginal, he famously conjectured the impossibility of constructing the evenly odd ordered mutually orthogonal Graeco-Latin squares. This conjecture was disproved in the mid 20th century. For clarity of exposition, two important variations of this method can be distinguished.

===Euler&#x27;s method===
This method consists in constructing two preliminary squares, which when added together gives the magic square. As a running example, a 3×3 magic square is considered. Each number of the 3×3 natural square by a pair of numbers can be labeled as


where every pair of Greek and Latin alphabets, e.g. &quot;αa&quot;, are meant to be added together, i.e. &quot;αa&quot; = &quot;α&quot; + &quot;a&quot;. Here, (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;) = (0, 3, 6) and (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) = (1, 2, 3). The numbers 0, 3, and 6 are referred to as the &quot;root numbers&quot; while the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are referred to as the &quot;primary numbers&quot;. An important general constraint here is

* &quot;a Greek letter is paired with a Latin letter only once&quot;.

Thus, the original square can now be split into two simpler squares:


The lettered squares are referred to as &quot;Greek square&quot; or &quot;Latin square&quot; if they are filled with Greek or Latin letters, respectively. A magic square can be constructed by ensuring that the Greek and Latin squares are magic squares too. The converse of this statement is also often, but not always (e.g. bordered magic squares), true: A magic square can be decomposed into a Greek and a Latin square, which are themselves magic squares. Thus the method is useful for both synthesis as well as analysis of a magic square. Lastly, by examining the pattern in which the numbers are laid out in the finished square, it is often possible to come up with a faster algorithm to construct higher order squares that replicate the given pattern, without the necessity of creating the preliminary Greek and Latin squares.

During the construction of the 3×3 magic square, the Greek and Latin squares with just three unique terms are much easier to deal with than the original square with nine different terms. The row sum and the column sum of the Greek square will be the same, &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; + &quot;γ&quot;, if

* &quot;each letter appears exactly once in a given column or a row&quot;.

This can be achieved by cyclic permutation of &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, and &quot;γ&quot;. Satisfaction of these two conditions ensures that the resulting square is a semi-magic square; and such Greek and Latin squares are said to be &quot;mutually orthogonal&quot; to each other. For a given order &quot;n&quot;, there are at most &quot;n&quot; − 1 squares in a set of mutually orthogonal squares, not counting the variations due to permutation of the symbols. This upper bound is exact when &quot;n&quot; is a prime number.

In order to construct a magic square, we should also ensure that the diagonals sum to magic constant. For this, we have a third condition:

* &quot;either all the letters should appear exactly once in both the diagonals; or in case of odd ordered squares, one of the diagonals should consist entirely of the middle term, while the other diagonal should have all the letters exactly once&quot;.

The mutually orthogonal Greek and Latin squares that satisfy the first part of the third condition (that all letters appear in both the diagonals) are said to be &quot;mutually orthogonal doubly diagonal Graeco-Latin squares&quot;.

Odd squares: For the 3×3 odd square, since &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, and &quot;γ&quot; are in arithmetic progression, their sum is equal to the product of the square&#x27;s order and the middle term, i.e. &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; + &quot;γ&quot; = 3 &quot;β&quot;. Thus, the diagonal sums will be equal if we have &quot;β&quot;s in the main diagonal and &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot; in the skew diagonal. Similarly, for the Latin square. The resulting Greek and Latin squares and their combination will be as below. The Latin square is just a 90 degree anti-clockwise rotation of the Greek square (or equivalently, flipping about the vertical axis) with the corresponding letters interchanged. Substituting the values of the Greek and Latin letters will give the 3×3 magic square.




For the odd squares, this method explains why the Siamese method (method of De la Loubere) and its variants work. This basic method can be used to construct odd ordered magic squares of higher orders. To summarise:

* &quot;For odd ordered squares, to construct Greek square, place the middle term along the main diagonal, and place the rest of the terms along the skew diagonal. The remaining empty cells are filled by diagonal moves. The Latin square can be constructed by rotating or flipping the Greek square, and replacing the corresponding alphabets. The magic square is obtained by adding the Greek and Latin squares.&quot;

A peculiarity of the construction method given above for the odd magic squares is that the middle number (&quot;n&quot;2 + 1)/2 will always appear at the center cell of the magic square. Since there are (&quot;n&quot; − 1)! ways to arrange the skew diagonal terms, we can obtain (&quot;n&quot; − 1)! Greek squares this way; same with the Latin squares. Also, since each Greek square can be paired with (&quot;n&quot; − 1)! Latin squares, and since for each of Greek square the middle term may be arbitrarily placed in the main diagonal or the skew diagonal (and correspondingly along the skew diagonal or the main diagonal for the Latin squares), we can construct a total of 2 × (&quot;n&quot; − 1)! × (&quot;n&quot; − 1)! magic squares using this method. For &quot;n&quot; = 3, 5, and 7, this will give 8, 1152, and 1,036,800 different magic squares, respectively. Dividing by 8 to neglect equivalent squares due to rotation and reflections, we obtain 1, 144, and 129,600 essentially different magic squares, respectively.

As another example, the construction of 5×5 magic square is given. Numbers are directly written in place of alphabets. The numbered squares are referred to as &quot;primary square&quot; or &quot;root square&quot; if they are filled with primary numbers or root numbers, respectively. The numbers are placed about the skew diagonal in the root square such that the middle column of the resulting root square has 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 (from bottom to top). The primary square is obtained by rotating the root square counter-clockwise by 90 degrees, and replacing the numbers. The resulting square is an associative magic square, in which every pair of numbers symmetrically opposite to the center sum up to the same value, 26. For e.g., 16+10, 3+23, 6+20, etc. In the finished square, 1 is placed at center cell of bottom row, and successive numbers are placed via elongated knight&#x27;s move (two cells right, two cells down), or equivalently, bishop&#x27;s move (two cells diagonally down right). When a collision occurs, the break move is to move one cell up. All the odd numbers occur inside the central diamond formed by 1, 5, 25 and 21, while the even numbers are placed at the corners. The occurrence of the even numbers can be deduced by copying the square to the adjacent sides. The even numbers from four adjacent squares will form a cross. 





A variation of the above example, where the skew diagonal sequence is taken in different order, is given below. The resulting magic square is the flipped version of the famous Agrippa&#x27;s Mars magic square. It is an associative magic square and is the same as that produced by Moschopoulos&#x27;s method. Here the resulting square starts with 1 placed in the cell which is to the right of the centre cell, and proceeds as De la Loubere&#x27;s method, with downwards-right move. When a collision occurs, the break move is to shift two cells to the right.



In the previous examples, for the Greek square, the second row can be obtained from the first row by circularly shifting it to the right by one cell. Similarly, the third row is a circularly shifted version of the second row by one cell to the right; and so on. Likewise, the rows of the Latin square is circularly shifted to the left by one cell. The row shifts for the Greek and Latin squares are in mutually opposite direction. It is possible to circularly shift the rows by more than one cell to create the Greek and Latin square.

* &quot;For odd ordered squares, whose order is not divisible by three, we can create the Greek squares by shifting a row by two places to the left or to the right to form the next row. The Latin square is made by flipping the Greek square along the main diagonal and interchanging the corresponding letters. This gives us a Latin square whose rows are created by shifting the row in the direction opposite to that of the Greek square. A Greek square and a Latin square should be paired such that their row shifts are in mutually opposite direction. The magic square is obtained by adding the Greek and Latin squares. When the order also happens to be a prime number, this method always creates pandiagonal magic square.&quot;

This essentially re-creates the knight&#x27;s move. All the letters will appear in both the diagonals, ensuring correct diagonal sum. Since there are &quot;n&quot;! permutations of the Greek letters by which we can create the first row of the Greek square, there are thus &quot;n&quot;! Greek squares that can be created by shifting the first row in one direction. Likewise, there are &quot;n&quot;! such Latin squares created by shifting the first row in the opposite direction. Since a Greek square can be combined with any Latin square with opposite row shifts, there are &quot;n&quot;! × &quot;n&quot;! such combinations. Lastly, since the Greek square can be created by shifting the rows either to the left or to the right, there are a total of 2 × &quot;n&quot;! × &quot;n&quot;! magic squares that can be formed by this method. For &quot;n&quot; = 5 and 7, since they are prime numbers, this method creates 28,800 and 50,803,200 pandiagonal magic squares. Dividing by 8 to neglect equivalent squares due to rotation and reflections, we obtain 3,600 and 6,350,400 equivalent squares. Further dividing by &quot;n&quot;2 to neglect equivalent panmagic squares due to cyclic shifting of rows or columns, we obtain 144 and 129,600 essentially different panmagic squares. For order 5 squares, these are the only panmagic square there are. The condition that the square&#x27;s order not be divisible by 3 means that we cannot construct squares of orders 9, 15, 21, 27, and so on, by this method.

In the example below, the square has been constructed such that 1 is at the center cell. In the finished square, the numbers can be continuously enumerated by the knight&#x27;s move (two cells up, one cell right). When collision occurs, the break move is to move one cell up, one cell left. The resulting square is a pandiagonal magic square. This square also has a further diabolical property that any five cells in quincunx pattern formed by any odd sub-square, including wrap around, sum to the magic constant, 65. For e.g., 13+7+1+20+24, 23+1+9+15+17, 13+21+10+19+2 etc. Also the four corners of any 5×5 square and the central cell, as well as the middle cells of each side together with the central cell, including wrap around, give the magic sum: 13+10+19+22+1 and 20+24+12+8+1. Lastly the four rhomboids that form elongated crosses also give the magic sum: 23+1+9+24+8, 15+1+17+20+12, 14+1+18+13+19, 7+1+25+22+10. Such squares with 1 at the center cell are also called God&#x27;s magic squares in Islamic amulet design, where the center cell is either left blank or filled with God&#x27;s name.



We can also combine the Greek and Latin squares constructed by different methods. In the example below, the primary square is made using knight&#x27;s move. We have re-created the magic square obtained by De la Loubere&#x27;s method. As before, we can form 8 × (&quot;n&quot; − 1)! × &quot;n&quot;! magic squares by this combination. For &quot;n&quot; = 5 and 7, this will create 23,040 and 29,030,400 magic squares. After dividing by 8 in order to neglect equivalent squares due to rotation and reflection, we get 2,880 and 3,628,800 squares. 



For order 5 squares, these three methods give a complete census of the number of magic squares that can be constructed by the method of superposition. Neglecting the rotation and reflections, the total number of magic squares of order 5 produced by the superposition method is 144 + 3,600 + 2,880 = 6,624.

Even squares: We can also construct even ordered squares in this fashion. Since there is no middle term among the Greek and Latin alphabets for even ordered squares, in addition to the first two constraint, for the diagonal sums to yield the magic constant, all the letters in the alphabet should appear in the main diagonal and in the skew diagonal.

An example of a 4×4 square is given below. For the given diagonal and skew diagonal in the Greek square, the rest of the cells can be filled using the condition that each letter appear only once in a row and a column.





Using these two Graeco-Latin squares, we can construct 2 × 4! × 4! = 1,152 magic squares. Dividing by 8 to eliminate equivalent squares due to rotation and reflections, we get 144 essentially different magic squares of order 4. These are the only magic squares constructible by the Euler method, since there are only two mutually orthogonal doubly diagonal Graeco-Latin squares of order 4.

Similarly, an 8×8 magic square can be constructed as below. Here the order of appearance of the numbers is not important; however the quadrants imitate the layout pattern of the 4×4 Graeco-Latin squares. 



Euler&#x27;s method has given rise to the study of Graeco-Latin squares. Euler&#x27;s method for constructing magic squares is valid for any order except 2 and 6.

Variations: Magic squares constructed from mutually orthogonal doubly diagonal Graeco-Latin squares are interesting in themselves since the magic property emerges from the relative position of the alphabets in the square, and not due to any arithmetic property of the value assigned to them. This means that we can assign any value to the alphabets of such squares and still obtain a magic square. This is the basis for constructing squares that display some information (e.g. birthdays, years, etc.) in the square and for creating &quot;reversible squares&quot;. For example, we can display the number &quot;π&quot; ≈ at the bottom row of a 4×4 magic square using the Graeco-Latin square given above by assigning (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, &quot;δ&quot;) = (10, 0, 90, 15) and (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) = (0, 2, 3, 4). We will obtain the following non-normal magic square with the magic sum 124:
===Narayana-De la Hire&#x27;s method for even orders===
Narayana-De la Hire&#x27;s method for odd square is the same as that of Euler&#x27;s. However, for even squares, we drop the second requirement that each Greek and Latin letter appear only once in a given row or column. This allows us to take advantage of the fact that the sum of an arithmetic progression with an even number of terms is equal to the sum of two opposite symmetric terms multiplied by half the total number of terms. Thus, when constructing the Greek or Latin squares,

* &quot;for even ordered squares, a letter can appear &quot;n&quot;/2 times in a column but only once in a row, or vice versa.&quot;

As a running example, if we take a 4×4 square, where the Greek and Latin terms have the values (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, &quot;δ&quot;) = (0, 4, 8, 12) and (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) = (1, 2, 3, 4), respectively, then we have &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; + &quot;γ&quot; + &quot;δ&quot; = 2 (&quot;α&quot; + &quot;δ&quot;) = 2 (&quot;β&quot; + &quot;γ&quot;). Similarly, &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; + &quot;d&quot; = 2 (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;d&quot;) = 2 (&quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;). This means that the complementary pair &quot;α&quot; and &quot;δ&quot; (or &quot;β&quot; and &quot;γ&quot;) can appear twice in a column (or a row) and still give the desired magic sum. Thus, we can construct:

* &quot;For even ordered squares, the Greek magic square is made by first placing the Greek alphabets along the main diagonal in some order. The skew diagonal is then filled in the same order or by picking the terms that are complementary to the terms in the main diagonal. Finally, the remaining cells are filled column wise. Given a column, we use the complementary terms in the diagonal cells intersected by that column, making sure that they appear only once in a given row but &quot;n&quot;/2 times in the given column. The Latin square is obtained by flipping or rotating the Greek square and interchanging the corresponding alphabets. The final magic square is obtained by adding the Greek and Latin squares.&quot;

In the example given below, the main diagonal (from top left to bottom right) is filled with sequence ordered as &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, &quot;δ&quot;, while the skew diagonal (from bottom left to top right) filled in the same order. The remaining cells are then filled column wise such that the complementary letters appears only once within a row, but twice within a column. In the first column, since &quot;α&quot; appears on the 1st and 4th row, the remaining cells are filled with its complementary term &quot;δ&quot;. Similarly, the empty cells in the 2nd column are filled with &quot;γ&quot;; in 3rd column &quot;β&quot;; and 4th column &quot;α&quot;. Each Greek letter appears only once along the rows, but twice along the columns. As such, the row sums are &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; + &quot;γ&quot; + &quot;δ&quot; while the column sums are either 2 (&quot;α&quot; + &quot;δ&quot;) or 2 (&quot;β&quot; + &quot;γ&quot;). Likewise for the Latin square, which is obtained by flipping the Greek square along the main diagonal and interchanging the corresponding letters.





The above example explains why the &quot;criss-cross&quot; method for doubly even magic square works. Another possible 4×4 magic square, which is also pan-diagonal as well as most-perfect, is constructed below using the same rule. However, the diagonal sequence is chosen such that all four letters &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, &quot;δ&quot; appear inside the central 2×2 sub-square. Remaining cells are filled column wise such that each letter appears only once within a row. In the 1st column, the empty cells need to be filled with one of the letters selected from the complementary pair &quot;α&quot; and &quot;δ&quot;. Given the 1st column, the entry in the 2nd row can only be &quot;δ&quot; since &quot;α&quot; is already there in the 2nd row; while, in the 3rd row the entry can only be &quot;α&quot; since &quot;δ&quot; is already present in the 3rd row. We proceed similarly until all cells are filled. The Latin square given below has been obtained by flipping the Greek square along the main diagonal and replacing the Greek alphabets with corresponding Latin alphabets. 





We can use this approach to construct singly even magic squares as well. However, we have to be more careful in this case since the criteria of pairing the Greek and Latin alphabets uniquely is not automatically satisfied. Violation of this condition leads to some missing numbers in the final square, while duplicating others. Thus, here is an important proviso:

* &quot;For singly even squares, in the Greek square, check the cells of the columns which is vertically paired to its complement. In such a case, the corresponding cell of the Latin square must contain the same letter as its horizontally paired cell.&quot;

Below is a construction of a 6×6 magic square, where the numbers are directly given, rather than the alphabets. The second square is constructed by flipping the first square along the main diagonal. Here in the first column of the root square the 3rd cell is paired with its complement in the 4th cells. Thus, in the primary square, the numbers in the 1st and 6th cell of the 3rd row are same. Likewise, with other columns and rows. In this example the flipped version of the root square satisfies this proviso.



As another example of a 6×6 magic square constructed this way is given below. Here the diagonal entries are arranged differently. The primary square is constructed by flipping the root square about the main diagonal. In the second square the proviso for singly even square is not satisfied, leading to a non-normal magic square (third square) where the numbers 3, 13, 24, and 34 are duplicated while missing the numbers 4, 18, 19, and 33.



The last condition is a bit arbitrary and may not always need to be invoked, as in this example, where in the root square each cell is vertically paired with its complement: 



As one more example, we have generated an 8×8 magic square. Unlike the criss-cross pattern of the earlier section for evenly even square, here we have a checkered pattern for the altered and unaltered cells. Also, in each quadrant the odd and even numbers appear in alternating columns.



Variations: A number of variations of the basic idea are possible: &quot;a complementary pair can appear &quot;n&quot;/2 times or less in a column&quot;. That is, a column of a Greek square can be constructed using more than one complementary pair. This method allows us to imbue the magic square with far richer properties. The idea can also be extended to the diagonals too. An example of an 8×8 magic square is given below. In the finished square each of four quadrants are pan-magic squares as well, each quadrant with same magic constant 130.



==Method of borders==
===Bordering method for order 3===
In this method, the objective is to wrap a border around a smaller magic square which serves as a core. Consider the 3×3 square for example. Subtracting the middle number 5 from each number 1, 2, ..., 9, we obtain 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±4, which we will, for lack of better words, following S. Harry White, refer to as bone numbers. The magic constant of a magic square, which we will refer to as the skeleton square, made by these bone numbers will be zero since adding all the rows of a magic square will give &quot;nM&quot; = Σ &quot;k&quot; = 0; thus &quot;M&quot; = 0.

It is not difficult to argue that the middle number should be placed at the center cell: let &quot;x&quot; be the number placed in the middle cell, then the sum of the middle column, middle row, and the two diagonals give Σ &quot;k&quot; + 3 &quot;x&quot; = 4 &quot;M&quot;. Since Σ &quot;k&quot; = 3 &quot;M&quot;, we have &quot;x&quot; = &quot;M&quot; / 3. Here &quot;M&quot; = 0, so &quot;x&quot; = 0.

Putting the middle number 0 in the center cell, we want to construct a border such that the resulting square is magic. Let the border be given by:

Since the sum of each row, column, and diagonals must be a constant (which is zero), we have

: &quot;a&quot; + &quot;a&quot; = 0, 
: &quot;b&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = 0, 
: &quot;u&quot; + &quot;u&quot; = 0,
: &quot;v&quot; + &quot;v&quot; = 0.

Now, if we have chosen &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;v&quot;, then we have &quot;a&quot; = −&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; = −&quot;b&quot;, &quot;u&quot; = −&quot;u&quot;, and &quot;v&quot; = −&quot;v&quot;. This means that if we assign a given number to a variable, say &quot;a&quot; = 1, then its complement will be assigned to &quot;a&quot;, i.e. &quot;a&quot; = −1. Thus out of eight unknown variables, it is sufficient to specify the value of only four variables. We will consider &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;v&quot; as independent variables, while &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;v&quot; as dependent variables. This allows us to consider a bone number ±&quot;x&quot; as a single number regardless of sign because (1) its assignment to a given variable, say &quot;a&quot;, will automatically imply that the same number of opposite sign will be shared with its complement &quot;a&quot;, and (2) two independent variables, say &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, cannot be assigned the same bone number. But how should we choose &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;v&quot;? We have the sum of the top row and the sum of the right column as

: &quot;u&quot; + &quot;a&quot; + &quot;v&quot; = 0,
: &quot;v&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;u&quot; = 0.

Since 0 is an even number, there are only two ways that the sum of three integers will yield an even number: 1) if all three were even, or 2) if two were odd and one was even. Since in our choice of numbers we only have two even non-zero number (±2 and ±4), the first statement is false. Hence, it must be the case that the second statement is true: that two of the numbers are odd and one even.

The only way that both the above two equations can satisfy this parity condition simultaneously, and still be consistent with the set of numbers we have, is when &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are odd. For on the contrary, if we had assumed &quot;u&quot; and &quot;a&quot; to be odd and &quot;v&quot; to be even in the first equation, then &quot;u&quot; = −&quot;u&quot; will be odd in the second equation, making &quot;b&quot; odd as well, in order to satisfy the parity condition. But this requires three odd numbers (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;b&quot;), contradicting the fact that we only have two odd numbers (±1 and ±3) which we can use. This proves that the odd bone numbers occupy the corners cells. When converted to normal numbers by adding 5, this implies that the corners of a 3×3 magic square are all occupied by even numbers.

Thus, taking &quot;u&quot; = 1 and &quot;v&quot; = 3, we have &quot;a&quot; = −4 and &quot;b&quot; = −2. Hence, the finished skeleton square will be as in the left. Adding 5 to each number, we get the finished magic square.


Similar argument can be used to construct larger squares. Since there does not exist a 2×2 magic square around which we can wrap a border to construct a 4×4 magic square, the next smallest order for which we can construct bordered square is the order 5.

===Bordering method for order 5===
Consider the fifth-order square. For this, we have a 3×3 magic core, around which we will wrap a magic border. The bone numbers to be used will be ±5, ±6, ±7, ±8, ±9, ±10, ±11, and ±12. Disregarding the signs, we have 8 bone numbers, 4 of which are even and 4 of which are odd. In general, for a square of any order &quot;n&quot;, there will be 4(&quot;n&quot; − 1) border cells, which are to be filled using 2(&quot;n&quot; − 1) bone numbers. Let the magic border be given as


As before, we should

* &quot;place a bone number and its complement opposite to each other, so that the magic sum will be zero.&quot;

It is sufficient to determine the numbers &quot;u, v, a, b, c, d, e, f&quot; to describe the magic border. As before, we have the two constraint equations for the top row and right column:

: &quot;u&quot; + &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; + &quot;v&quot; = 0
: &quot;v&quot; + &quot;d&quot; + &quot;e&quot; + &quot;f&quot; + &quot;u*&quot; = 0.

Multiple solutions are possible. The standard procedure is to

* &quot;first try to determine the corner cells, after which we will try to determine the rest of the border.&quot;

There are 28 ways of choosing two numbers from the set of 8 bone numbers for the corner cells &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;. However, not all pairs are admissible. Among the 28 pairs, 16 pairs are made of an even and an odd number, 6 pairs have both as even numbers, while 6 pairs have them both as odd numbers.

We can prove that the corner cells &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; cannot have an even and an odd number. This is because if this were so, then the sums &quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot; and &quot;v&quot; + &quot;u&quot; will be odd, and since 0 is an even number, the sums &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; + &quot;e&quot; + &quot;f&quot; should be odd as well. The only way that the sum of three integers will result in an odd number is when 1) two of them are even and one is odd, or 2) when all three are odd. Since the corner cells are assumed to be odd and even, neither of these two statements are compatible with the fact that we only have 3 even and 3 odd bone numbers at our disposal. This proves that &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; cannot have different parity. This eliminates 16 possibilities.

Using similar type reasoning we can also draw some conclusions about the sets {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;} and {&quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;}. If &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are both even, then both the sets should have two odd numbers and one even number. If &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are both odd, then one of the sets should have three even numbers while the other set should have one even number and two odd numbers.

As a running example, consider the case when both &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are even. The 6 possible pairs are: (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 12), (8, 10), (8, 12), and (10, 12). Since the sums &quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot; and &quot;v&quot; + &quot;u&quot; are even, the sums &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; + &quot;e&quot; + &quot;f&quot; should be even as well. The only way that the sum of three integers will result in an even number is when 1) two of them are odd and one is even, or 2) when all three are even. The fact that the two corner cells are even means that we have only 2 even numbers at our disposal. Thus, the second statement is not compatible with this fact. Hence, it must be the case that the first statement is true: two of the three numbers should be odd, while one be even.

Now let &quot;a, b, d, e&quot; be odd numbers while &quot;c&quot; and &quot;f&quot; be even numbers. Given the odd bone numbers at our disposal: ±5, ±7, ±9, and ±11, their differences range from &quot;D&quot; = {±2, ±4, ±6} while their sums range from &quot;S&quot; = {±12, ±14, ±16, ±18, ±20}. It is also useful to have a table of their sum and differences for later reference. Now, given the corner cells (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;), we can check its admissibility by checking if the sums &quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot; + &quot;c&quot; and &quot;v&quot; + &quot;u&quot; + &quot;f&quot; fall within the set &quot;D&quot; or &quot;S&quot;. The admissibility of the corner numbers is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the solution to exist.

For example, if we consider the pair (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) = (8, 12), then &quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot; = 20 and &quot;v&quot; + &quot;u*&quot; = 6; and we will have ±6 and ±10 even bone numbers at our disposal. Taking &quot;c&quot; = ±6, we have the sum &quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot; + &quot;c&quot; to be 26 and 14, depending on the sign of ±6 taken, both of which do not fall within the sets &quot;D&quot; or &quot;S&quot;. Likewise, taking &quot;c&quot; = ±10, we have the sum &quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot; + &quot;c&quot; to be 30 and 10, both of which again do not fall within the sets &quot;D&quot; or &quot;S&quot;. Thus, the pair (8, 12) is not admissible. By similar process of reasoning, we can also rule out the pair (6, 12).

As another example, if we consider the pair (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) = (10, 12), then &quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot; = 22 and &quot;v&quot; + &quot;u&quot; = 2; and we will have ± 6 and ± 8 even bone numbers at our disposal. Taking &quot;c&quot; = ±6, we have the sum &quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot; + &quot;c&quot; to be 28 and 16. While 28 does not fall within the sets &quot;D&quot; or &quot;S&quot;, 16 falls in set &quot;S&quot;. By inspection, we find that if (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) = (−7, − 9), then &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = −16; and it will satisfy the first constraint equation. Also, taking &quot;f&quot; = ± 8, we have the sum &quot;v&quot; + &quot;u&quot; + &quot;f&quot; to be 10 and -6. While 10 does not fall within the sets &quot;D&quot; or &quot;S&quot;, −6 falls in set &quot;D&quot;. Since −7 and −9 have already been assigned to &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, clearly (&quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;) = (-5, 11) so that &quot;d&quot; + &quot;e&quot; = 6; and it will satisfy the second constraint equation.

Likewise, taking &quot;c&quot; = ±8, we have the sum &quot;u&quot; + &quot;v&quot; + &quot;c&quot; to be 30 and 14. While 30 does not fall within the sets &quot;D&quot; or &quot;S&quot;, 14 falls in set &quot;S&quot;. By inspection, we find that if (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) = (−5, −9), then &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = −14. Also, taking &quot;f&quot; = ± 6, we have the sum &quot;v&quot; + &quot;u&quot; + &quot;f&quot; to be 8 and -4. While 8 does not fall within the sets &quot;D&quot; or &quot;S&quot;, −4 falls in set &quot;D&quot;. Clearly, (&quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;) = (−7, 11) so that &quot;d&quot; + &quot;e&quot; = 4, and the second constraint equation will be satisfied.

Hence the corner pair (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) = (10, 12) is admissible; and it admits two solutions: and . The finished skeleton squares are given below. The magic square is obtained by adding 13 to each cells.




Using similar process of reasoning, we can construct the following table for the values of &quot;u, v, a, b, c, d, e, f&quot; expressed as bone numbers as given below. There are only 6 possible choices for the corner cells, which leads to 10 possible border solutions.

Given this group of 10 borders, we can construct 10×8×(3!)2 = 2880 essentially different bordered magic squares. Here the bone numbers ±5, ..., ±12 were consecutive. More bordered squares can be constructed if the numbers are not consecutive. If non-consecutive bone numbers were also used, then there are a total of 605 magic borders. Thus, the total number of order 5 essentially different bordered magic squares (with consecutive and non-consecutive numbers) is 174,240. See history. The number of fifth-order magic squares constructible via the bordering method is about 26 times larger than via the superposition method.

===Continuous enumeration methods===
Exhaustive enumeration of all the borders of a magic square of a given order, as done previously, is very tedious. As such a structured solution is often desirable, which allows us to construct a border for a square of any order. Below we give three algorithms for constructing border for odd, doubly even, and singly even squares. These continuous enumeration algorithms were discovered in 10th century by Arab scholars; and their earliest surviving exposition comes from the two treatises by al-Buzjani and al-Antaki, although they themselves were not the discoverers. Since then many more such algorithms have been discovered.

Odd-ordered squares: The following is the algorithm given by al-Buzjani to construct a border for odd squares. A peculiarity of this method is that for order &quot;n&quot; square, the two adjacent corners are numbers and .

Starting from the cell above the lower left corner, we put the numbers alternately in left column and bottom row until we arrive at the middle cell. The next number is written in the middle cell of the bottom row just reached, after which we fill the cell in the upper left corner, then the middle cell of the right column, then the upper right corner. After this, starting from the cell above middle cell of the right column already filled, we resume the alternate placement of the numbers in the right column and the top row. Once half of the border cells are filled, the other half are filled by numbers complementary to opposite cells. The subsequent inner borders is filled in the same manner, until the square of order 3 is filled.

Below is an example for 9th-order square.
Doubly even order: The following is the method given by al-Antaki. Consider an empty border of order &quot;n&quot; = 4&quot;k&quot; with &quot;k&quot; ≥ 3. The peculiarity of this algorithm is that the adjacent corner cells are occupied by numbers &quot;n&quot; and .

Starting at the upper left corner cell, we put the successive numbers by groups of four, the first one next to the corner, the second and the third on the bottom, and the fourth at the top, and so on until there remains in the top row (excluding the corners) six empty cells. We then write the next two numbers above and the next four below. We then fill the upper corners, first left then right. We place the next number below the upper right corner in the right column, the next number on the other side in the left column. We then resume placing groups of four consecutive numbers in the two columns as before. Once half of the border cells are filled, the other half are filled by numbers complementary to opposite cells.

The example below gives the border for order 16 square.
For order 8 square, we just begin directly with the six cells.
Singly even order: For singly even order, we have the algorithm given by al-Antaki. Here the corner cells are occupied by &quot;n&quot; and &quot;n&quot; − 1. Below is an example of 10th-order square.

Start by placing 1 at the bottom row next to the left corner cell, then place 2 in the top row. After this, place 3 at the bottom row and turn around the border in anti-clockwise direction placing the next numbers, until &quot;n&quot; − 2 is reached on the right column. The next two numbers are placed in the upper corners (&quot;n&quot; − 1 in upper left corner and &quot;n&quot; in upper right corner). Then, the next two numbers are placed on the left column, then we resume the cyclic placement of the numbers until half of all the border cells are filled. Once half of the border cells are filled, the other half are filled by numbers complementary to opposite cells.

==Method of composition==
===For squares of order &quot;m × n&quot; where &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2===
This is a method reminiscent of the Kronecker product of two matrices, that builds an &quot;nm&quot; × &quot;nm&quot; magic square from an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; magic square and an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;m&quot; magic square. The &quot;product&quot; of two magic squares creates a magic square of higher order than the two multiplicands. Let the two magic squares be of orders &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. The final square will be of order &quot;m × n&quot;. Divide the square of order &quot;m × n&quot; into &quot;m × m&quot; sub-squares, such that there are a total of &quot;n&quot;2 such sub-squares. In the square of order &quot;n&quot;, reduce by 1 the value of all the numbers. Multiply these reduced values by &quot;m&quot;2, and place the results in the corresponding sub-squares of the &quot;m × n&quot; whole square. The squares of order &quot;m&quot; are added &quot;n&quot;2 times to the sub-squares of the final square. The peculiarity of this construction method is that each magic subsquare will have different magic sums. The square made of such magic sums from each magic subsquare will again be a magic square. The smallest composite magic square of order 9, composed of two order 3 squares is given below.




Since each of the 3×3 sub-squares can be independently rotated and reflected into 8 different squares, from this single 9×9 composite square we can derive 89 = 134,217,728 essentially different 9×9 composite squares. Plenty more composite magic squares can also be derived if we select non-consecutive numbers in the magic sub-squares, like in Yang Hui&#x27;s version of the 9×9 composite magic square. The next smallest composite magic squares of order 12, composed of magic squares of order 3 and 4 are given below.





For the base squares, there is only one essentially different 3rd order square, while there 880 essentially different 4th-order squares that we can choose from. Each pairing can produce two different composite squares. Since each magic sub-squares in each composite square can be expressed in 8 different forms due to rotations and reflections, there can be 1×880×89 + 880×1×816 ≈ 2.476×1017 essentially different 12×12 composite magic squares created this way, with consecutive numbers in each sub-square. In general, if there are &quot;c&quot;m and &quot;c&quot;n essentially different magic squares of order &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, then we can form &quot;c&quot;m × &quot;c&quot;n × ( 8&quot;m&quot;2 + 8&quot;n&quot;2) composite squares of order &quot;mn&quot;, provided &quot;m&quot; ≠ &quot;n&quot;. If &quot;m&quot; = &quot;n&quot;, then we can form (&quot;c&quot;m)2 × 8&quot;m&quot;2 composite squares of order &quot;m&quot;2.

===For squares of doubly even order===
When the squares are of doubly even order, we can construct a composite magic square in a manner more elegant than the above process, in the sense that every magic subsquare will have the same magic constant. Let &quot;n&quot; be the order of the main square and &quot;m&quot; the order of the equal subsquares. The subsquares are filled one by one, in any order, with a continuous sequence of &quot;m&quot;2/2 smaller numbers (i.e. numbers less than or equal to &quot;n&quot;2/2) together with their complements to &quot;n&quot;2 + 1. Each subsquare as a whole will yield the same magic sum. The advantage of this type of composite square is that each subsquare is filled in the same way and their arrangement is arbitrary. Thus, the knowledge of a single construction of even order will suffice to fill the whole square. Furthermore, if the subsquares are filled in the natural sequence, then the resulting square will be pandiagonal. The magic sum of the subsquares is related to the magic sum of the whole square by formula_69 where &quot;n&quot; = &quot;km&quot;.

In the examples below, we have divided the order 12 square into nine subsquares of order 4 filled each with eight smaller numbers and, in the corresponding bishop&#x27;s cells (two cells diagonally across, including wrap arounds, in the 4×4 subsquare), their complements to &quot;n&quot;2 + 1 = 145. Each subsquare is pandiagonal with magic constant 290; while the whole square on the left is also pandiagonal with magic constant 870.



In another example below, we have divided the order 12 square into four order 6 squares. Each of the order 6 squares are filled with eighteen small numbers and their complements using bordering technique given by al-Antaki. If we remove the shaded borders of the order 6 subsquares and form an order 8 square, then this order 8 square is again a magic square. In its full generality, we can take any &quot;m&quot;2/2 smaller numbers together with their complements to &quot;n&quot;2 + 1 to fill the subsquares, not necessarily in continuous sequence.

===Medjig-method for squares of even order 2&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2===
In this method a magic square is &quot;multiplied&quot; with a medjig square to create a larger magic square. The namesake of this method derives from mathematical game called medjig created by Willem Barink in 2006, although the method itself is much older. An early instance of a magic square constructed using this method occurs in Yang Hui&#x27;s text for order 6 magic square. The LUX method to construct singly even magic squares is a special case of the medjig method, where only 3 out of 24 patterns are used to construct the medjig square.

The pieces of the medjig puzzle are 2×2 squares on which the numbers 0, 1, 2 and 3 are placed. There are three basic patterns by which the numbers 0, 1, 2 and 3 can be placed in a 2×2 square, where 0 is at the top left corner:




Each pattern can be reflected and rotated to obtain 8 equivalent patterns, giving us a total of 3×8 = 24 patterns. The aim of the puzzle is to take &quot;n&quot;2 medjig pieces and arrange them in an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; &quot;medjig square&quot; in such a way that each row, column, along with the two long diagonals, formed by the medjig square sums to 3&quot;n&quot;, the magic constant of the medjig square. An &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; medjig square can create a 2&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;n&quot; magic square where &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2.

Given an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; medjig square and an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; magic square base, a magic square of order 2&quot;n&quot;×2&quot;n&quot; can be constructed as follows:
* Each cell of an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; magic square is associated with a corresponding 2×2 subsquare of the medjig square
* Fill each 2×2 subsquares of the medjig square with the four numbers from 1 to 4&quot;n&quot;2 that equal the original number modulo &quot;n&quot;2, i.e. &quot;x&quot;+&quot;n&quot;2&quot;y&quot; where &quot;x&quot; is the corresponding number from the magic square and &quot;y&quot; is a number from 0 to 3 in the 2×2 subsquares.

Assuming that we have an initial magic square base, the challenge lies in constructing a medjig square. For reference, the sums of each medjig piece along the rows, columns and diagonals, denoted in italics, are:




Doubly even squares: The smallest even ordered medjig square is of order 2 with magic constant 6. While it is possible to construct a 2×2 medjig square, we cannot construct a 4×4 magic square from it since 2×2 magic squares required to &quot;multiply&quot; it does not exist. Nevertheless, it is worth constructing these 2×2 medjig squares. The magic constant 6 can be partitioned into two parts in three ways as 6 = 5 + 1 = 4 + 2 = 3 + 3. There exist 96 such 2×2 medjig squares. In the examples below, each 2×2 medjig square is made by combining different orientations of a single medjig piece.




We can use the 2×2 medjig squares to construct larger even ordered medjig squares. One possible approach is to simply combine the 2×2 medjig squares together. Another possibility is to wrap a smaller medjig square core with a medjig border. The pieces of a 2×2 medjig square can form the corner pieces of the border. Yet another possibility is to append a row and a column to an odd ordered medjig square. An example of an 8×8 magic square is constructed below by combining four copies of the left most 2×2 medjig square given above:




The next example is constructed by bordering a 2×2 medjig square core.




Singly even squares: Medjig square of order 1 does not exist. As such, the smallest odd ordered medjig square is of order 3, with magic constant 9. There are only 7 ways of partitioning the integer 9, our magic constant, into three parts. If these three parts correspond to three of the medjig pieces in a row, column or diagonal, then the relevant partitions for us are:

: 9 = 1 + 3 + 5 = 1 + 4 + 4 = 2 + 3 + 4 = 2 + 2 + 5 = 3 + 3 + 3.

A 3×3 medjig square can be constructed with some trial-and-error, as in the left most square below. Another approach is to add a row and a column to a 2×2 medjig square. In the middle square below, a left column and bottom row has been added, creating an L-shaped medjig border, to a 2×2 medjig square given previously. The right most square below is essentially same as the middle square, except that the row and column has been added in the middle to form a cross while the pieces of 2×2 medjig square are placed at the corners.




Once a 3×3 medjig square has been constructed, it can be converted into a 6×6 magic square. For example, using the left most 3×3 medjig square given above:




There are 1,740,800 such 3×3 medjig squares. An easy approach to construct higher order odd medjig square is by wrapping a smaller odd ordered medjig square with a medjig border, just as with even ordered medjig squares. Another approach is to append a row and a column to an even ordered medjig square. Approaches such as the LUX method can also be used. In the example below, a 5×5 medjig square is created by wrapping a medjig border around a 3×3 medjig square given previously:




==Solving partially completed magic squares==
Solving partially completed magic squares is a popular mathematical pastime. The techniques needed are similar to those used in Sudoku or KenKen puzzles, and involve deducing the values of unfilled squares using logic and permutation group theory (Sudoku grids are &quot;not&quot; magic squares but are based on a related idea called Graeco-Latin squares).

==Variations of the magic square==

===Extra constraints===

Certain extra restrictions can be imposed on magic squares.

If raising each number to the &quot;n&quot;th power yields another magic square, the result is a bimagic (n = 2), a trimagic (n = 3), or, in general, a multimagic square.

A magic square in which the number of letters in the name of each number in the square generates another magic square is called an alphamagic square.

There are magic squares consisting entirely of primes. Rudolf Ondrejka (1928–2001) discovered the following 3×3 magic square of primes, in this case nine Chen primes:

The Green–Tao theorem implies that there are arbitrarily large magic squares consisting of primes.

The following &quot;reversible magic square&quot; has a magic constant of 264 both upside down and right way up:

When the extra constraint is to display some date, especially a birth date, then such magic squares are called birthday magic square. An early instance of such birthday magic square was created by Srinivasa Ramanujan. He created a 4×4 square in which he entered his date of birth in D–M–C-Y format in the top row and the magic happened with additions and subtractions of numbers in squares. Not only do the rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same number, but the four corners, the four middle squares (17, 9, 24, 89), the first and last rows two middle numbers (12, 18, 86, 23), and the first and last columns two middle numbers (88, 10, 25, 16) all add up to the sum of 139.

===Multiplicative magic squares===
Instead of &quot;adding&quot; the numbers in each row, column and diagonal, one can apply some other operation. For example, a multiplicative magic square has a constant &quot;product&quot; of numbers. A multiplicative magic square can be derived from an additive magic square by raising 2 (or any other integer) to the power of each element, because the logarithm of the product of 2 numbers is the sum of logarithm of each. Alternatively, if any 3 numbers in a line are 2&quot;a&quot;, 2&quot;b&quot; and 2&quot;c&quot;, their product is 2&quot;a&quot;+&quot;b&quot;+&quot;c&quot;, which is constant if &quot;a&quot;+&quot;b&quot;+&quot;c&quot; is constant, as they would be if &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; were taken from ordinary (additive) magic square. For example, the original Lo-Shu magic square becomes:

Other examples of multiplicative magic squares include:




===Multiplicative magic squares of complex numbers===
Still using Ali Skalli&#x27;s non iterative method, it is possible to produce an infinity of multiplicative magic squares of complex numbers belonging to formula_70 set. On the example below, the real and imaginary parts are integer numbers, but they can also belong to the entire set of real numbers formula_71.
The product is: −352,507,340,640 − 400,599,719,520 &quot;i&quot;.

===Additive-multiplicative magic and semimagic squares===

Additive-multiplicative magic squares and semimagic squares satisfy properties of both ordinary and multiplicative magic squares and semimagic squares, respectively.

It is unknown if any additive-multiplicative magic squares smaller than 7×7 exist, but it has been proven that no 3×3 or 4×4 additive-multiplicative magic squares and no 3×3 additive-multiplicative semimagic squares exist.

===Geometric magic squares===

Magic squares may be constructed which contain geometric shapes instead of numbers. Such squares, known as geometric magic squares, were invented and named by Lee Sallows in 2001.

In the example shown the shapes appearing are two dimensional. It was Sallows&#x27; discovery that &quot;all&quot; magic squares are geometric, the numbers that appear in numerical magic squares can be interpreted as a shorthand notation which indicates the lengths of straight line segments that are the geometric &#x27;shapes&#x27; occurring in the square. That is, numerical magic squares are that special case of a geometric magic square using one dimensional shapes.

=== Area magic squares ===

In 2017, following initial ideas of William Walkington and Inder Taneja, the first linear area magic square (L-AMS) was constructed by Walter Trump.

===Other magic shapes===
Other two dimensional shapes than squares can be considered. The general case is to consider a design with &quot;N&quot; parts to be magic if the &quot;N&quot; parts are labeled with the numbers 1 through &quot;N&quot; and a number of identical sub-designs give the same sum. Examples include magic circles, magic rectangles, magic triangles magic stars, magic hexagons, magic diamonds. Going up in dimension results in magic spheres, magic cylinders, magic cubes, magic parallelepiped, magic solids, and other magic hypercubes.

Possible magic shapes are constrained by the number of equal-sized, equal-sum subsets of the chosen set of labels. For example, if one proposes to form a magic shape labeling the parts with {1, 2, 3, 4}, the sub-designs will have to be labeled with {1,4} and {2,3}.

===&quot;n&quot;-Queens problem===
In 1992, Demirörs, Rafraf, and Tanik published a method for converting some magic squares into &quot;n&quot;-queens solutions, and vice versa.
==Magic squares in occultism==
Magic squares of order 3 through 9, assigned to the seven planets, and described as means to attract the influence of planets and their angels (or demons) during magical practices, can be found in several manuscripts all around Europe starting at least since the 15th century. Among the best known, the &quot;Liber de Angelis&quot;, a magical handbook written around 1440, is included in Cambridge Univ. Lib. MS Dd.xi.45. The text of the &quot;Liber de Angelis&quot; is very close to that of &quot;De septem quadraturis planetarum seu quadrati magici&quot;, another handbook of planetary image magic contained in the Codex 793 of the Biblioteka Jagiellońska (Ms BJ 793). The magical operations involve engraving the appropriate square on a plate made with the metal assigned to the corresponding planet, as well as performing a variety of rituals. For instance, the 3×3 square, that belongs to Saturn, has to be inscribed on a lead plate. It will, in particular, help women during a difficult childbirth.

In about 1510 Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa wrote &quot;De Occulta Philosophia&quot;, drawing on the Hermetic and magical works of Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. In its 1531 edition, he expounded on the magical virtues of the seven magical squares of orders 3 to 9, each associated with one of the astrological planets, much in the same way as the older texts did. This book was very influential throughout Europe until the Counter-Reformation, and Agrippa&#x27;s magic squares, sometimes called kameas, continue to be used within modern ceremonial magic in much the same way as he first prescribed.
The most common use for these kameas is to provide a pattern upon which to construct the sigils of spirits, angels or demons; the letters of the entity&#x27;s name are converted into numbers, and lines are traced through the pattern that these successive numbers make on the kamea.
In a magical context, the term &quot;magic square&quot; is also applied to a variety of word squares or number squares found in magical grimoires, including some that do not follow any obvious pattern, and even those with differing numbers of rows and columns. They are generally intended for use as talismans. For instance the following squares are: The Sator square, one of the most famous magic squares found in a number of grimoires including the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot;; a square &quot;to overcome envy&quot;, from &quot;The Book of Power&quot;; and two squares from &quot;The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage&quot;, the first to cause the illusion of a superb palace to appear, and the second to be worn on the head of a child during an angelic invocation:




==Magic squares in popular culture==
* In Goethe&#x27;s Faust, the witch&#x27;s spell used to make a youth elixir for Faust, the &quot;&quot;, has been interpreted as a construction of a magic square.
* The English composer Peter Maxwell Davies has used magic squares to structure many of his compositions. For example, his 1975 &quot;Ave Maris Stella&quot; uses the 9×9 magic square of Moon while his 1977 &quot;A Mirror of Whitening Light&quot; uses the 8×8 magic square of Mercury to create the entire set of notes and durations for the piece. His other works that employ magic squares include &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; (1979), &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1987), &quot;Strathclyde Concerto No. 3 for Horn and Trumpet&quot; (1989), as well as many of his symphonies. According to Davies&#x27; own account:
A magic square in a musical composition is not a block of numbers – it is a generating principle, to be learned and known intimately, perceived inwardly as a multi-dimensional projection into that vast (chaotic!) area of the internal ear – the space/time crucible – where music is conceived. ... Projected onto the page, a magic square is a dead, black conglomeration of digits; tune in, and one hears a powerful, orbiting dynamo of musical images, glowing with numen and lumen.

* Magic squares, including Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s, appear as clues to the mystery in Katherine Neville&#x27;s novels &quot;The Eight&quot; and &quot;The Fire&quot;.
* Magic squares play a role in Steve Martin&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;The Pleasure of My Company&quot;.
* Dürer&#x27;s magic square and his &quot;Melencolia I&quot; both also played large roles in Dan Brown&#x27;s 2009 novel, &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot;.
* In the 2011 Korean television drama &quot;Deep Rooted Tree&quot;, King Sejong is shown attempting to construct a 33×33 magic square using lunch boxes. He ultimately discovers the &quot;pyramid method&quot; and completes the magic square with the help of an army of court attendants. This inspires him to create a more just form of government ruled by reason and words rather than military might.
* On October 9, 2014, the post office of Macao in the People&#x27;s Republic of China issued a series of stamps based on magic squares. The figure below shows the stamps featuring the nine magic squares chosen to be in this collection.

<text>A nanowire is a nanostructure in the form of a wire with the diameter of the order of a nanometre (10−9 m). More generally, nanowires can be defined as structures that have a thickness or diameter constrained to tens of nanometers or less and an unconstrained length. At these scales, quantum mechanical effects are important—which coined the term &quot;quantum wires&quot;.

Many different types of nanowires exist, including superconducting (e.g. YBCO), metallic (e.g. Ni, Pt, Au, Ag), semiconducting (e.g. silicon nanowires (SiNWs), InP, GaN) and insulating (e.g. SiO2, TiO2).

Molecular nanowires are composed of repeating molecular units either organic (e.g. DNA) or inorganic (e.g. Mo6S9−&quot;x&quot;I&quot;x&quot;).

== Characteristics ==
Typical nanowires exhibit aspect ratios (length-to-width ratio) of 1000 or more. As such they are often referred to as one-dimensional (1-D) materials. Nanowires have many interesting properties that are not seen in bulk or 3-D (three-dimensional) materials. This is because electrons in nanowires are quantum confined laterally and thus occupy energy levels that are different from the traditional continuum of energy levels or bands found in bulk materials.

A consequence of this quantum confinement in nanowires is that they exhibit discrete values of the electrical conductance. Such discrete values arise from a quantum mechanical constraint on the number electronic transport channels at the nanometer scale, and they are often approximately equal to integer multiples of the quantum of conductance:
: formula_1

This conductance is twice the reciprocal of the resistance unit called the von Klitzing constant, defined as and named for Klaus von Klitzing, the discoverer of the integer quantum Hall effect.

Examples of nanowires include inorganic molecular nanowires (Mo6S9−&quot;x&quot;I&quot;x&quot;, Li2Mo6Se6), which can have a diameter of 0.9 nm and be hundreds of micrometers long. Other important examples are based on semiconductors such as InP, Si, GaN, etc., dielectrics (e.g. SiO2,TiO2), or metals (e.g. Ni, Pt).

There are many applications where nanowires may become important in electronic, opto-electronic and nanoelectromechanical devices, as additives in advanced composites, for metallic interconnects in nanoscale quantum devices, as field-emitters and as leads for biomolecular nanosensors.

== Synthesis ==
There are two basic approaches to synthesizing nanowires: top-down and bottom-up. A top-down approach reduces a large piece of material to small pieces, by various means such as lithography, milling or thermal oxidation. A bottom-up approach synthesizes the nanowire by combining constituent adatoms. Most synthesis techniques use a bottom-up approach. Initial synthesis via either method may often be followed by a nanowire thermal treatment step, often involving a form of self-limiting oxidation, to fine tune the size and aspect ratio of the structures. After the bottom-up synthesis, nanowires can be integrated using pick-and-place techniques.

Nanowire production uses several common laboratory techniques, including suspension, electrochemical deposition, vapor deposition, and VLS growth. Ion track technology enables growing homogeneous and segmented nanowires down to 8 nm diameter. As nanowire oxidation rate is controlled by diameter, thermal oxidation steps are often applied to tune their morphology.

=== Suspension ===
A suspended nanowire is a wire produced in a high-vacuum chamber held at the longitudinal extremities. Suspended nanowires can be produced by:
* The chemical etching of a larger wire
* The bombardment of a larger wire, typically with highly energetic ions
* Indenting the tip of a STM in the surface of a metal near its melting point, and then retracting it

=== VLS growth ===
A common technique for creating a nanowire is vapor–liquid–solid method (VLS), which was first reported by Wagner and Ellis in 1964 for silicon whiskers with diameters ranging from hundreds of nm to hundreds of μm. This process can produce high-quality crystalline nanowires of many semiconductor materials, for example, VLS–grown single crystalline silicon nanowires (SiNWs) with smooth surfaces could have excellent properties, such as ultra-large elasticity. This method uses a source material from either laser ablated particles or a feed gas such as silane.

VLS synthesis requires a catalyst. For nanowires, the best catalysts are liquid metal (such as gold) nanoclusters, which can either be self-assembled from a thin film by dewetting, or purchased in colloidal form and deposited on a substrate.

The source enters these nanoclusters and begins to saturate them. On reaching supersaturation, the source solidifies and grows outward from the nanocluster. Simply turning off the source can adjust the final length of the nanowire. Switching sources while still in the growth phase can create compound nanowires with super-lattices of alternating materials. For example, a method termed ENGRAVE (Encoded Nanowire GRowth and Appearance through VLS and Etching) developed by the Cahoon Lab at UNC-Chapel Hill allows for nanometer-scale morphological control via rapid &quot;in situ&quot; dopant modulation.

A single-step vapour phase reaction at elevated temperature synthesises inorganic nanowires such as Mo6S9−&quot;x&quot;I&quot;x&quot;. From another point of view, such nanowires are cluster polymers.

Similar to VLS synthesis, VSS (vapor-solid-solid) synthesis of nanowires (NWs) proceeds through thermolytic decomposition of a silicon precursor (typically phenylsilane). Unlike VLS, the catalytic seed remains in solid state when subjected to high temperature annealing of the substrate. This such type of synthesis is widely used to synthesise metal silicide/germanide nanowires through VSS alloying between a copper substrate and a silicon/germanium precursor.

=== Solution-phase synthesis ===
Solution-phase synthesis refers to techniques that grow nanowires in solution. They can produce nanowires of many types of materials. Solution-phase synthesis has the advantage that it can produce very large quantities, compared to other methods. In one technique, the polyol synthesis, ethylene glycol is both solvent and reducing agent. This technique is particularly versatile at producing nanowires of gold, lead, platinum, and silver.

The supercritical fluid-liquid-solid growth method can be used to synthesize semiconductor nanowires, e.g., Si and Ge. By using metal nanocrystals as seeds, Si and Ge organometallic precursors are fed into a reactor filled with a supercritical organic solvent, such as toluene. Thermolysis results in degradation of the precursor, allowing release of Si or Ge, and dissolution into the metal nanocrystals. As more of the semiconductor solute is added from the supercritical phase (due to a concentration gradient), a solid crystallite precipitates, and a nanowire grows uniaxially from the nanocrystal seed.

=== Liquid Bridge Induced Self-assembly ===
Protein nanowires in spider silk have been formed by rolling a droplet of spider silk solution over a superhydrophobic pillar structure.

=== Non-catalytic growth ===
The vast majority of nanowire-formation mechanisms are explained through the use of catalytic nanoparticles, which drive the nanowire growth and are either added intentionally or generated during the growth. However, nanowires can be also grown without the help of catalysts, which gives an advantage of pure nanowires and minimizes the number of technological steps. The mechanisms for catalyst-free growth of nanowires (or whiskers) were known from 1950s.

The simplest methods to obtain metal oxide nanowires use ordinary heating of the metals, e.g. metal wire heated with battery, by Joule heating in air can be easily done at home. Spontaneous nanowire formation by non-catalytic methods were explained by the dislocation present in specific directions or the growth anisotropy of various crystal faces. More recently, after microscopy advancement, the nanowire growth driven by screw dislocations or twin boundaries were demonstrated. The picture on the right shows a single atomic layer growth on the tip of CuO nanowire, observed by in situ TEM microscopy during the non-catalytic synthesis of nanowire.

Atomic-scale nanowires can also form completely self-organised without need for defects. For example, rare-earth silicide (RESi2) nanowires of few nm width and height and several 100 nm length form on silicon(001) substrates which are covered with a sub-monolayer of a rare earth metal and subsequently annealed. The lateral dimensions of the nanowires confine the electrons in such a way that the system resembles a (quasi-)one-dimensional metal. Metallic RESi2 nanowires form on silicon(&quot;hhk&quot;) as well. This system permits tuning the dimensionality between two-dimensional and one-dimensional by the coverage and the tilt angle of the substrate.

=== DNA-templated metallic nanowire synthesis ===

An emerging field is to use DNA strands as scaffolds for metallic nanowire synthesis. This method is investigated both for the synthesis of metallic nanowires in electronic components and for biosensing applications, in which they allow the transduction of a DNA strand into a metallic nanowire that can be electrically detected. Typically, ssDNA strands are stretched, whereafter they are decorated with metallic nanoparticles that have been functionalised with short complementary ssDNA strands.

=== Crack-Defined Shadow Mask Lithography ===

A simple method to produce nanowires with defined geometries has been recently reported using conventional optical lithography. In this approach, optical lithography is used to generate nanogaps using controlled crack formation. These nanogaps are then used as shadow mask for generating individual nanowires with precise lengths and widths. This technique allows to produce individual nanowires below 20 nm in width in a scalable way out of several metallic and metal oxide materials.

== Physics ==

=== Conductivity ===
Several physical reasons predict that the conductivity of a nanowire will be much less than that of the corresponding bulk material. First, there is scattering from the wire boundaries, whose effect will be very significant whenever the wire width is below the free electron mean free path of the bulk material. In copper, for example, the mean free path is 40 nm. Copper nanowires less than 40 nm wide will shorten the mean free path to the wire width. Silver nanowires have very different electrical and thermal conductivity from bulk silver.

Nanowires also show other peculiar electrical properties due to their size. Unlike single wall carbon nanotubes, whose motion of electrons can fall under the regime of ballistic transport (meaning the electrons can travel freely from one electrode to the other), nanowire conductivity is strongly influenced by edge effects. The edge effects come from atoms that lay at the nanowire surface and are not fully bonded to neighboring atoms like the atoms within the bulk of the nanowire. The unbonded atoms are often a source of defects within the nanowire, and may cause the nanowire to conduct electricity more poorly than the bulk material. As a nanowire shrinks in size, the surface atoms become more numerous compared to the atoms within the nanowire, and edge effects become more important.

The conductance in a nanowire is described as the sum of the transport by separate &quot;channels&quot;, each having a different electronic wavefunction normal to the wire. The thinner the wire is, the smaller the number of channels available to the transport of electrons. As a result, wires that are only one or a few atoms wide exhibit quantization of the conductance: i.e. the conductance can assume only discrete values that are multiples of the conductance quantum (where &quot;e&quot; is the elementary charge and &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant) (see also &quot;Quantum Hall effect&quot;). This quantization has been observed by measuring the conductance of a nanowire suspended between two electrodes while pulling it progressively longer: as its diameter reduces, its conductivity decreases in a stepwise fashion and the plateaus correspond approximately to multiples of &quot;G&quot;0.

The quantization of conductivity is more pronounced in semiconductors like Si or GaAs than in metals, because of their lower electron density and lower effective mass. It can be observed in 25 nm wide silicon fins, and results in increased threshold voltage. In practical terms, this means that a MOSFET with such nanoscale silicon fins, when used in digital applications, will need a higher gate (control) voltage to switch the transistor on.

=== Welding ===

To incorporate nanowire technology into industrial applications, researchers in 2008 developed a method of welding nanowires together: a sacrificial metal nanowire is placed adjacent to the ends of the pieces to be joined (using the manipulators of a scanning electron microscope); then an electric current is applied, which fuses the wire ends. The technique fuses wires as small as 10 nm.

For nanowires with diameters less than 10 nm, existing welding techniques, which require precise control of the heating mechanism and which may introduce the possibility of damage, will not be practical. Recently scientists discovered that single-crystalline ultrathin gold nanowires with diameters ≈ 3–10 nm can be &quot;cold-welded&quot; together within seconds by mechanical contact alone, and under remarkably low applied pressures (unlike macro- and micro-scale cold welding process). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and in situ measurements reveal that the welds are nearly perfect, with the same crystal orientation, strength and electrical conductivity as the rest of the nanowire. The high quality of the welds is attributed to the nanoscale sample dimensions, oriented-attachment mechanisms and mechanically assisted fast surface diffusion. Nanowire welds were also demonstrated between gold and silver, and silver nanowires (with diameters ≈ 5–15 nm) at near room temperature, indicating that this technique may be generally applicable for ultrathin metallic nanowires. Combined with other nano- and microfabrication technologies, cold welding is anticipated to have potential applications in the future bottom-up assembly of metallic one-dimensional nanostructures.

=== Mechanical properties ===

The study of nanowire mechanics has boomed since the advent of the atomic force microscope (AFM), and associated technologies which have enabled direct study of the response of the nanowire to an applied load. Specifically, a nanowire can be clamped from one end, and the free end displaced by an AFM tip. In this cantilever geometry, the height of the AFM is precisely known, and the force applied is precisely known. This allows for construction of a force vs. displacement curve, which can be converted to a stress vs. strain curve if the nanowire dimensions are known. From the stress-strain curve, the elastic constant known as the Young&#x27;s Modulus can be derived, as well as the toughness, and degree of strain-hardening.

==== Young&#x27;s modulus ====
The elastic component of the stress-strain curve described by the Young&#x27;s Modulus, has been reported for nanowires, however the modulus depends very strongly on the microstructure. Thus a complete description of the modulus dependence on diameter is lacking. Analytically, continuum mechanics has been applied to estimate the dependence of modulus on diameter: formula_2 in tension, where formula_3 is the bulk modulus, formula_4 is the thickness of a shell layer in which the modulus is surface dependent and varies from the bulk, formula_5 is the surface modulus, and formula_6 is the diameter. This equation implies that the modulus increases as the diameter decreases. However, various computational methods such as molecular dynamics have predicted that modulus should decrease as diameter decreases.

Experimentally, gold nanowires have been shown to have a Young&#x27;s modulus which is effectively diameter independent. Similarly, nano-indentation was applied to study the modulus of silver nanowires, and again the modulus was found to be 88 GPa, very similar to the modulus of bulk Silver (85 GPa) These works demonstrated that the analytically determined modulus dependence seems to be suppressed in nanowire samples where the crystalline structure highly resembles that of the bulk system.

In contrast, Si solid nanowires have been studied, and shown to have a decreasing modulus with diameter The authors of that work report a Si modulus which is half that of the bulk value, and they suggest that the density of point defects, and or loss of chemical stoichiometry may account for this difference.

==== Yield strength ====

The plastic component of the stress strain curve (or more accurately the onset of plasticity) is described by the yield strength. The strength of a material is increased by decreasing the number of defects in the solid, which occurs naturally in nanomaterials where the volume of the solid is reduced. As a nanowire is shrunk to a single line of atoms, the strength should theoretically increase all the way to the molecular tensile strength. Gold nanowires have been described as &#x27;ultrahigh strength&#x27; due to the extreme increase in yield strength, approaching the theoretical value of &quot;E&quot;/10. This huge increase in yield is determined to be due to the lack of dislocations in the solid. Without dislocation motion, a &#x27;dislocation-starvation&#x27; mechanism is in operation. The material can accordingly experience huge stresses before dislocation motion is possible, and then begins to strain-harden. For these reasons, nanowires (historically described as &#x27;whiskers&#x27;) have been used extensively in composites for increasing the overall strength of a material. Moreover, nanowires continue to be actively studied, with research aiming to translate enhanced mechanical properties to novel devices in the fields of MEMS or NEMS.

== Possible applications ==

=== Electronic devices ===
Nanowires have been proposed for use as MOSFETs (MOS field-effect transistors). MOS transistors are used widely as fundamental building elements in today&#x27;s electronic circuits. As predicted by Moore&#x27;s law, the dimension of MOS transistors is shrinking smaller and smaller into nanoscale. One of the key challenges of building future nanoscale MOS transistors is ensuring good gate control over the channel. In general, having a wider gate relative to the total transistor length affords greater gate control. Therefore, the high aspect ratio of nanowires potentially allows for good gate control.

Due to their one-dimensional structure with unusual optical properties, the nanowire are of interest for photovoltaic devices. Compared with its bulk counterparts, the nanowire solar cells are less sensitive to impurities due to bulk recombination, and thus silicon wafers with lower purity can be used to achieve acceptable efficiency, leading to the reduction on material consumption.

After p-n junctions were built with nanowires, the next logical step was to build logic gates. By connecting several p-n junctions together, researchers have been able to create the basis of all logic circuits: the AND, OR, and NOT gates have all been built from semiconductor nanowire crossings.

In August 2012, researchers reported constructing the first NAND gate from undoped silicon nanowires. This avoids the problem of how to achieve precision doping of complementary nanocircuits, which is unsolved. They were able to control the Schottky barrier to achieve low-resistance contacts by placing a silicide layer in the metal-silicon interface.

It is possible that semiconductor nanowire crossings will be important to the future of digital computing. Though there are other uses for nanowires beyond these, the only ones that actually take advantage of physics in the nanometer regime are electronic.

In addition, nanowires are also being studied for use as photon ballistic waveguides as interconnects in quantum dot/quantum effect well photon logic arrays. Photons travel inside the tube, electrons travel on the outside shell.

When two nanowires acting as photon waveguides cross each other the juncture acts as a quantum dot.

Conducting nanowires offer the possibility of connecting molecular-scale entities in a molecular computer. Dispersions of conducting nanowires in different polymers are being investigated for use as transparent electrodes for flexible flat-screen displays.

Because of their high Young&#x27;s moduli, their use in mechanically enhancing composites is being investigated. Because nanowires appear in bundles, they may be used as tribological additives to improve friction characteristics and reliability of electronic transducers and actuators.

Because of their high aspect ratio, nanowires are also suited to dielectrophoretic manipulation, which offers a low-cost, bottom-up approach to integrating suspended dielectric metal oxide nanowires in electronic devices such as UV, water vapor, and ethanol sensors.

Due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, physico-chemical reactions are facilitated on the surface of nanowires.

=== Single nanowire devices for gas and chemical sensing ===

The high aspect ratio of nanowires makes this nanostructures suitable for electrochemical sensing with the potential for ultimate sensitivity. One of the challenge for the use of nanowires in commercial products is related to the isolation, handling, and integration of nanowires in an electrical circuit when using the conventional and manual pick-and-place approach, leading to a very limited throughput. Recent developments in the nanowire synthesis methods now allow for parallel production of single nanowire devices with useful applications in electrochemistry, photonics, and gas- and biosensing.

=== Nanowire lasers ===
Nanowire lasers are nano-scaled lasers with potential as optical interconnects and optical data communication on chip. Nanowire lasers are built from III–V semiconductor heterostructures, the high refractive index allows for low optical loss in the nanowire core. Nanowire lasers are subwavelength lasers of only a few hundred nanometers. Nanowire lasers are Fabry–Perot resonator cavities defined by the end facets of the wire with high-reflectivity, recent developments have demonstrated repetition rates greater than 200 GHz offering possibilities for optical chip level communications.

=== Sensing of proteins and chemicals using semiconductor nanowires ===

In an analogous way to FET devices in which the modulation of conductance (flow of electrons/holes) in the semiconductor, between the input (source) and the output (drain) terminals, is controlled by electrostatic potential variation (gate-electrode) of the charge carriers in the device conduction channel, the methodology of a Bio/Chem-FET is based on the detection of the local change in charge density, or so-called &quot;field effect&quot;, that characterizes the recognition event between a target molecule and the surface receptor.

This change in the surface potential influences the Chem-FET device exactly as a &#x27;gate&#x27; voltage does, leading to a detectable and measurable change in the device conduction. When these devices are fabricated using semiconductor nanowires as the transistor element the binding of a chemical or biological species to the surface of the sensor can lead to the depletion or accumulation of charge carriers in the &quot;bulk&quot; of the nanometer diameter nanowire i.e. (small cross section available for conduction channels). Moreover, the wire, which serves as a tunable conducting channel, is in close contact with the sensing environment of the target, leading to a short response time, along with orders of magnitude increase in the sensitivity of the device as a result of the huge S/V ratio of the nanowires.

While several inorganic semiconducting materials such as Si, Ge, and metal oxides (e.g. In2O3, SnO2, ZnO, etc.) have been used for the preparation of nanowires, Si is usually the material of choice when fabricating nanowire FET-based chemo/biosensors.

Several examples of the use of silicon nanowire(SiNW) sensing devices include the ultra sensitive, real-time sensing of biomarker proteins for cancer, detection of single virus particles, and the detection of nitro-aromatic explosive materials such as 2,4,6-tri-nitrotoluene (TNT) in sensitives superior to these of canines.
Silicon nanowires could also be used in their twisted form, as electromechanical devices, to measure intermolecular forces with great precision.

==== Limitations of sensing with silicon nanowire FET devices ====
Generally, the charges on dissolved molecules and macromolecules are screened by dissolved counterions, since in most cases molecules bound to the devices are separated from the sensor surface by approximately 2–12 nm (the size of the receptor proteins or DNA linkers bound to the sensor surface). As a result of the screening, the electrostatic potential that arises from charges on the analyte molecule decays exponentially toward zero with distance. Thus, for optimal sensing, the Debye length must be carefully selected for nanowire FET measurements.
One approach of overcoming this limitation employs fragmentation of the antibody-capturing units and control over surface receptor density, allowing more intimate binding to the nanowire of the target protein. This approach proved useful for dramatically enhancing the sensitivity of cardiac biomarkers (e.g. Troponin) detection directly from serum for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.

=== Nanowire assisted transfer of sensitive TEM samples ===

For a minimal introduction of stress and bending to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples (lamellae, thin films, and other mechanically and beam sensitive samples), when transferring inside a focused ion beam (FIB), flexible metallic nanowires can be attached to a typically rigid micromanipulator.

The main advantages of this method include a significant reduction of sample preparation time (quick welding and cutting of nanowire at low beam current), and minimization of stress-induced bending, Pt contamination, and ion beam damage.
This technique is particularly suitable for in situ electron microscopy sample preparation.

== Corn-like nanowires ==

Corn-like nanowire is a one-dimensional nanowire with interconnected nanoparticles on the surface, providing a large percentage of reactive facets. TiO2 corn-like nanowires were first prepared by a surface modification concept using surface tension stress mechanism through a two consecutive hydrothermal operation, and showed an increase of 12% in dye-sensitized solar cell efficiency the light scattering layer. CdSe corn-like nanowires grown by chemical bath deposition and corn-like γ-Fe2O3@SiO2@TiO2 photocatalysts induced by magnetic dipole interactions have been also reported previously.

<text>A superellipse, also known as a Lamé curve after Gabriel Lamé, is a closed curve resembling the ellipse, retaining the geometric features of semi-major axis and semi-minor axis, and symmetry about them, but defined by an equation that allows for various shapes between a rectangle and an ellipse.

In two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, a superellipse is defined as the set of all points formula_1 on the curve that satisfy the equationformula_2where formula_3 and formula_4 are positive numbers referred to as semi-diameters or semi-axes of the superellipse, and formula_5 is a positive parameter that defines the shape. When formula_6, the superellipse is an ordinary ellipse. For formula_7, the shape is more rectangular with rounded corners, and for formula_8, it is more pointed.

In the polar coordinate system, the superellipse equation is (the set of all points formula_9 on the curve satisfy the equation):formula_10

== Specific cases ==

This formula defines a closed curve contained in the rectangle and . The parameters formula_3 and formula_4 are the semi-diameters or semi-axes of the curve. The overall shape of the curve is determined by the value of the exponent formula_5, as shown in the following table:

If formula_14, the figure is also called a hypoellipse; if formula_7, a hyperellipse. When formula_16 and formula_17, the superellipse is the boundary of a ball of formula_18 in the formula_5-norm. The extreme points of the superellipse are (formula_20) and (formula_21), and its four &quot;corners&quot; are (formula_22,formula_23), where formula_24 (sometimes called the &quot;superness&quot;).

==Mathematical properties==
When &quot;n&quot; is a positive rational number formula_25 (in lowest terms), then each quadrant of the superellipse is a plane algebraic curve of order formula_25. In particular, when formula_27 and &quot;n&quot; is an even integer, then it is a Fermat curve of degree &quot;n&quot;. In that case it is non-singular, but in general it will be singular. If the numerator is not even, then the curve is pieced together from portions of the same algebraic curve in different orientations.

The curve is given by the parametric equations (with parameter formula_28 having no elementary geometric interpretation)formula_29where each formula_30 can be chosen separately so that each value of formula_28 gives four points on the curve. Equivalently, letting formula_28 range over formula_33formula_34where the sign function isformula_35Here formula_28 is not the angle between the positive horizontal axis and the ray from the origin to the point, since the tangent of this angle equals formula_37 while in the parametric expressions formula_38

===Area===

The area inside the superellipse can be expressed in terms of the gamma function asformula_39or in terms of the beta function as
:formula_40

===Perimeter===

The perimeter of a superellipse, like that of an ellipse, does not admit closed-form solution purely using elementary functions. Exact solutions for the perimeter of a superellipse exist using infinite summations; these could be truncated to obtain approximate solutions. Numerical integration is another option to obtain perimeter estimates at arbitrary precision.

A closed-form approximation obtained via symbolic regression is also an option that balances parsimony and accuracy. Consider a superellipse centered on the origin of a 2D plane. Now, imagine that the superellipse (with shape parameter formula_5) is stretched such that the first quadrant (e.g., formula_42, formula_43) is an arc from formula_44 to formula_45, with formula_46. Then, the arc length of the superellipse within that single quadrant is approximated as the following function of formula_47 and formula_5:

codice_1

This single-quadrant arc length approximation is accurate to within ±0.2% for across all values of formula_5, and can be used to efficiently estimate the total perimeter of a superellipse.

===Pedal curve===

The pedal curve is relatively straightforward to compute. Specifically, the pedal offormula_50is given in polar coordinates byformula_51 

==Generalizations==
The generalization of these shapes can involve several approaches.The generalizations of the superellipse in higher dimensions retain the fundamental mathematical structure of the superellipse while adapting it to different contexts and applications.

=== Higher dimensions ===
The generalizations of the superellipse in higher dimensions retain the fundamental mathematical structure of the superellipse while adapting it to different contexts and applications.

* A superellipsoid extends the superellipse into three dimensions, creating shapes that vary between ellipsoids and rectangular solids with rounded edges. The superellipsoid is defined as the set of all points formula_52 that satisfy the equation:formula_53where formula_54 and formula_55 are positive numbers referred to as the semi-axes of the superellipsoid, and formula_5 is a positive parameter that defines the shape.
* A hyperellipsoid is the formula_57-dimensional analogue of an ellipsoid (and by extension, a superellipsoid). It is defined as the set of all points formula_58 that satisfy the equation:formula_59where formula_60 are positive numbers referred to as the semi-axes of the hyperellipsoid, and formula_5 is a positive parameter that defines the shape.

=== Different exponents ===

Using different exponents for each term in the equation, allowing more flexibility in shape formation.

For two-dimensional case the equation is formula_62 where formula_63 either equals to or differs from &quot;formula_5&quot;. If formula_65, it is the Lamé&#x27;s superellipses. If formula_66, the curve possesses more flexibility of behavior, and is better possible fit to describe some experimental information.

For the three-dimensional case, three different positive powers formula_63&quot;, formula_5&quot; and formula_69 can be used in the equation formula_70. If formula_71, a super-ellipsoid is obtained. If any two or all three powers differ from each other, a solid is obtained that may possess more flexibility in representing real structural data than the super ellipsoid. A three-dimensional super-ellipsoid with formula_72, formula_73 and the semi-diameters formula_27, formula_75 represents the structure of the National Centre for the Performing Arts in China.

In the general formula_76–dimensional case, the equation is formula_77, where In general, formula_78 may differ from each other. It is the superellipsoid only if formula_79.

=== Related shapes ===
Superquadrics are a family of shapes that include superellipsoids as a special case. They are used in computer graphics and geometric modeling to create complex, smooth shapes with easily adjustable parameters. While not a direct generalization of superellipses, hyperspheres also share the concept of extending geometric shapes into higher dimensions. These related shapes demonstrate the versatility and broad applicability of the fundamental principles underlying superellipses.

=== Anisotropic scaling ===
Anisotropic scaling involves scaling the shape differently along different axes, providing additional control over the geometry. This approach can be applied to superellipses, superellipsoids, and their higher-dimensional analogues to produce a wider variety of forms and better fit specific requirements in applications such as computer graphics, structural design, and data visualization. For instance, anisotropic scaling allows the creation of shapes that can model real-world objects more accurately by adjusting the proportions along each axis independently.

== History ==
The general Cartesian notation of the form comes from the French mathematician Gabriel Lamé (1795–1870), who generalized the equation for the ellipse.

Hermann Zapf&#x27;s typeface Melior, published in 1952, uses superellipses for letters such as &quot;o&quot;. Thirty years later Donald Knuth would build the ability to choose between true ellipses and superellipses (both approximated by cubic splines) into his Computer Modern type family.

The superellipse was named by the Danish poet and scientist Piet Hein (1905–1996) though he did not discover it as it is sometimes claimed. In 1959, city planners in Stockholm, Sweden announced a design challenge for a roundabout in their city square Sergels Torg. Piet Hein&#x27;s winning proposal was based on a superellipse with &quot;n&quot; = 2.5 and &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; = 6/5. As he explained it:
Sergels Torg was completed in 1967. Meanwhile, Piet Hein went on to use the superellipse in other artifacts, such as beds, dishes, tables, etc. By rotating a superellipse around the longest axis, he created the superegg, a solid egg-like shape that could stand upright on a flat surface, and was marketed as a novelty toy.

In 1968, when negotiators in Paris for the Vietnam War could not agree on the shape of the negotiating table, Balinski, Kieron Underwood and Holt suggested a superelliptical table in a letter to the New York Times. The superellipse was used for the shape of the 1968 Azteca Olympic Stadium, in Mexico City.

The second floor of the original World Trade Center in New York City consisted of a large, superellipse-shaped overhanging balcony.

Waldo R. Tobler developed a map projection, the Tobler hyperelliptical projection, published in 1973, in which the meridians are arcs of superellipses.

The logo for news company The Local consists of a tilted superellipse matching the proportions of Sergels Torg. Three connected superellipses are used in the logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

In computing, mobile operating system iOS uses a superellipse curve for app icons, replacing the rounded corners style used up to version 6.

<text>The Original Dixieland Jass Band (ODJB) was a Dixieland jazz band that made the first jazz recordings in early 1917. Their &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot; became the first jazz record ever issued. The group composed and recorded many jazz standards, the most famous being &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;. In late 1917, the spelling of the band&#x27;s name was changed to Original Dixieland Jazz Band.

The band consisted of five musicians who had played in the Papa Jack Laine bands.

ODJB billed itself as &quot;the Creators of Jazz&quot;. It was the first band to record jazz commercially and to have hit recordings in the genre. Band leader and cornetist Nick LaRocca argued that ODJB deserved recognition as the first band to record jazz commercially and the first band to establish jazz as a musical idiom or genre.

The original quintet disbanded in 1926. Ten years later, Nick LaRocca recruited most of the quintet to form a new swing band featuring the ODJB members. The full quintet reunited in 1936 to great acclaim, and finally disbanded in 1938.

==Origins==

In early 1916, a promoter from Chicago approached clarinetist Alcide Nunez and drummer Johnny Stein about bringing a New Orleans-style band to Chicago, where the similar Brown&#x27;s Band From Dixieland, led by trombonist Tom Brown, was enjoying success. They then assembled trombonist Eddie Edwards, pianist Henry Ragas, and cornetist Frank Christian. Shortly before they were to leave, Christian backed out, and Nick LaRocca was hired as a last-minute replacement.

On March 3, 1916 the musicians began their job at Schiller&#x27;s Cafe in Chicago under the name Stein&#x27;s Dixie Jass Band. The band was a hit and received offers of higher pay elsewhere. Since Stein as leader was the only musician under contract by name, the rest of the band broke off, sent to New Orleans for drummer Tony Sbarbaro, and on June 5, started playing under the name, The Dixie Jass Band. LaRocca and Nunez had personality conflicts, and on October 30 Tom Brown&#x27;s Band and ODJB agreed to swap clarinetists, bringing Larry Shields into the Original Dixieland Jass Band. The band attracted the attention of theatrical agent Max Hart, who booked the band in New York City. At the start of 1917 the band began an engagement playing for dancing at Reisenweber&#x27;s Cafe, on Columbus Circle, in Manhattan.

==First recordings==
While a couple of other New Orleans bands had passed through New York City slightly earlier, they were part of vaudeville acts. ODJB, on the other hand, played for dancing and hence, were the first &quot;jass&quot; band to get a following of fans in New York and then record at a time when the American recording industry was essentially centered in the northeastern United States, primarily in New York City and Camden, New Jersey.

Shortly after arriving in New York, a letter dated January 29, 1917, offered the band an audition for the Columbia Graphophone Company. The session took place on Wednesday, January 31, 1917. Nothing from this test session was issued.

The band then recorded two sides for the Victor Talking Machine Company, &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot; and &quot;Dixieland Jass Band One-Step&quot;, on February 26, 1917 at Victor&#x27;s New York studios. These titles were released as Victor 18255 in May 1917, the first issued jazz record. The band&#x27;s recordings, first marketed as a novelty, were a surprise hit, and gave many Americans their first taste of jazz. Musician Joe Jordan sued, since the &quot;One Step&quot; incorporated portions of his 1909 ragtime composition &quot;That Teasin&#x27; Rag&quot;. The record labels subsequently were changed to &quot;Introducing &#x27;That Teasin&#x27; Rag&#x27; by Joe Jordan&quot;. A court case dispute over the authorship of &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot; resulted in the judge declaring the tune in the &quot;public domain&quot;.

In the wake of the group&#x27;s success of the Victor record, the ODJB returned to Columbia in May, recording two selections of popular tunes of the day chosen for them by the label (possibly hoping to avoid the copyright problems which arose after Victor recorded two of the band&#x27;s supposedly original compositions) &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot; and &quot;(Back Home Again in) Indiana&quot; as catalogue #A-2297.

Numerous jazz bands were formed in the wake of the success of ODJB that copied and replicated its style and sound. Also bands were brought from Chicago and California (such as the Frisco Jass Band) in an attempts to join the jazz craze. Established bands of different types and bandleaders such as Wilbur Sweatman began billing their groups as &quot;jass&quot; or &quot;jazz&quot; bands. Earl Fuller, bandleader at a competing New York venue, was ordered by management to form a &quot;jass&quot; band.

W. C. Handy recorded one of the earliest cover versions of an ODJB tune when he released a recording of &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot; by Handy&#x27;s Orchestra of Memphis for Columbia in 1917.

In 1918, the song &quot;When You Hear That Dixieland Jazz Band Play&quot; by Shelton Brooks, &quot;the King of Ragtime Writers&quot;, was published by Will Rossiter in Chicago. It was a tribute to the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, who were featured on the cover.

==Original New Orleans Jazz Band==
When the New Orleans Jazz style swept New York by storm in 1917 with the arrival of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, Jimmy Durante was part of the audience at Reisenweber&#x27;s Cafe on Columbus Circle when ODJB played that venue. Durante was very impressed with the band and invited them to play at a club called the Alamo in Harlem where Jimmy played piano.

Durante had his friend, Johnny Stein (the previous drummer and leader of the group), assemble a group of like-minded New Orleans musicians to accompany his act at the Alamo. Stein did so, with a band consisting of fellow veterans of the Laine bands in New Orleans, other than pianist Durante. In late 1918 they recorded two sides for Okeh under the name of the New Orleans Jazz Band. They recorded the same two numbers a couple of months later for Gennett under the name of Original New Orleans Jazz Band, and in 1920 the same group recorded again for Gennett as Jimmy Durante&#x27;s Jazz Band. They later billed themselves as &quot;Durante&#x27;s Jazz and Novelty Band&quot;.

==Sicilian influence==
Both LaRocca and Sbarbaro were children of immigrants from the Italian region of Sicily. The Sicilian capital of Palermo had long held cotton and citrus fruit trade with New Orleans. This resulted in the establishment of a direct shipping line between the two port cities which enabled a vast number of Sicilians to migrate to New Orleans, and other American cities, between the late 1800s and early 1900s. With this migration, Sicilian sound was brought to New Orleans and integrated with regional African-American music. The band would capitalize on this growing integration.

==Later history of the band==

After their initial recording for the Victor Company, the ODJB recorded for Columbia Records (after the first Victor session, not before as has sometimes been reported) and Aeolian-Vocalion in 1917, then returned to Victor the following year, while enjoying continued popularity in New York. Trombonist Edwards was drafted for World War I in 1918 and replaced by Emile Christian, and pianist Henry Ragas died of influenza in the 1918 flu pandemic the following year and he was replaced by pianist and composer J. Russel Robinson.

Robinson&#x27;s compositions for the band recorded and released in 1920, include the classic &quot;Margie&quot; and &quot;Palesteena (Lena from Palesteena)&quot;, were among the most popular and best-selling hits of 1920. &quot;Aggravatin&#x27; Papa&quot; was composed with lyricist Roy Turk and Addie Britt and was recorded by Alberta Hunter in 1923 with Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s Dance Orchestra and also by Bessie Smith, Sophie Tucker, Florence Mills, Lucille Hegamin, and Pearl Bailey. Robinson also collaborated with Roy Turk on the compositions &quot;Sweet Man O&#x27; Mine&quot; and &quot;A-Wearin&#x27; Away the Blues&quot;, and he wrote &quot;Mama Whip! Mama Spank! (If Her Daddy Don&#x27;t Come Home)&quot; for blues and jazz singer Mamie Smith and her Jazz Band in 1921, which were released on the Okeh label. Robinson was a member of the band until 1923; he rejoined the band when it reformed in 1936.

&quot;Margie&quot;, composed by J. Russel Robinson with Con Conrad, with lyrics added by Benny Davis, has been covered over a hundred times. &quot;Margie&quot; has been recorded by Louis Armstrong, who also covered the band&#x27;s &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;, Ray Charles, Al Jolson, Duke Ellington and His Orchestra in 1935, the Billy Kyle Swing Club Band, Claude Hopkins, Red Nichols, Django Reinhardt, George Paxton, the Dutch Swing College Band, Fats Domino, Sidney Bechet, Don Redman, Cab Calloway, Jim Reeves, Gene Krupa, and Benny Goodman.

&quot;Margie&quot; was a no. 9 hit for ODJB in 1921 with J. Russel Robinson on piano. Eddie Cantor had the biggest hit version of the ODJB classic, spending five weeks at no. 1 in 1921. The song also was featured in the movie &quot;The Eddie Cantor Story&quot; and was the theme of the television series of the same name in 1961–1962. Cantor also recorded ODJB&#x27;s &quot;Palesteena (Lena from Palesteena)&quot;. Gene Rodemich and His Orchestra reached no. 7 with their version in 1920. Ted Lewis and His Band reached no. 4 in 1921. Frank Crumit had a no. 7 hit in 1921. Claude Hopkins and His Orchestra reached no. 5 in 1934 with Orlando Peterson on vocals. Don Redman and His Orchestra got to no. 15 in 1939 with a cover of the ODJB song. Dave Brubeck, Bix Beiderbecke, Bing Crosby, Jo Stafford, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Charlie Shavers, Jimmy Smith, Joe Venuti, Ray Barretto, and Shelly Manne also have recorded the song. Jimmie Lunceford recorded the song in 1938 with a Sy Oliver arrangement that featured Trummy Young.

==London tour==

Other New Orleans musicians, including Nunez, Tom Brown, and Frank Christian, followed ODJB&#x27;s example and went to New York to play jazz as well, giving the band competition. LaRocca decided to take the band to London, where they would once again enjoy being the only authentic New Orleans jazz band in the metropolis, and again present themselves as the Originators of Jazz because they were the first band to record the new genre of music dubbed jass or jazz. The band&#x27;s April 7, 1919 appearance in the revue &quot;Joy Bells&quot; at the London Hippodrome was the first official live jazz performance by any band in the United Kingdom and was followed by a command performance for King George V at Buckingham Palace. The concert did not start auspiciously, with the assembled aristocracy, which included French Marshal Philippe Pétain, peering through opera glasses at the band &quot;as though there were bugs on us&quot;, according to LaRocca. The audience loosened up, however, after the king laughed and loudly applauded their rendition of &quot;The Tiger Rag&quot;. The British tour ended with the band being chased to the Southampton docks by Lord Harrington, who was infuriated that his daughter was being romanced by the lead singer of the band. In London, they made twenty more recordings for the British branch of Columbia. While in London, they recorded the second, more commercially successful, version of their hit song &quot;Soudan&quot; (also known as &quot;Oriental Jass&quot;).

The band returned to the United States in July 1920 and toured for four years. This version of the band played in a more commercial style, adding a saxophone to the arrangements in the manner of other popular orchestras. Jazz pianist and composer Frank Signorelli, who collaborated on the jazz standards &quot;A Blues Serenade&quot; recorded by Glenn Miller and Duke Ellington, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, and &quot;Stairway to the Stars&quot;, joined the ODJB for a brief time in 1921. 

In November 1925 Nick LaRocca announced that he was retiring from the music business. He was replaced by 19-year-old trumpeter Henry Levine, who in 1940 brought this kind of repertoire to the NBC radio show &quot;The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street&quot;. With LaRocca&#x27;s departure Tony Sbarbaro, now the only original member of the ODJB, became the bandleader. The personnel for this final incarnation of the &quot;original&quot; ODJB was Tony Sbarbaro (drums), Henry Levine (trumpet), Artie Seaberg (clarinet), Al Caplan (trombone), and Wilder Chase (piano). The band finished out its contract with New York&#x27;s Cinderella Ballroom in February 1926, and then disbanded.

== Break-ups and reunions ==
The band broke up in 1926 because its brand of free-wheeling jazz was then considered old-fashioned. As Abel Green of &quot;Variety&quot; put it: &quot;[Paul] Whiteman with his symphonic syncopation came along and made America and the world conscious of his arranged sweet foxtrotology. Then the Dixieland Band folded for good.&quot;

The band members scattered. Leader/trumpeter Nick LaRocca returned to his construction business in New Orleans. Clarinetist Larry Shields moved to Chicago, then to New Orleans where he worked for a Bible publisher. Trombonist Eddie Edwards was discovered operating a newsstand in New York City; newspaper publicity resulted in Edwards fronting a local nightclub band. Drummer Tony Sbarbaro was now a mechanic. Pianist J. Russel Robinson was in radio, a musical director for the NBC network. Although &quot;Variety&quot; reported in November 1932 that Victor planned to use the band in new remakes of their old hits, only Eddie Edwards and Tony Sbarbaro were mentioned, with nightclub emcee Kendall Capps set to front the &quot;Original Dixieland Jazz Band&quot; in live performances. Nothing came of this and no recordings resulted.

In October 1935 Tony Sbarbaro recorded four sides for Vocalion with his own quintet, billed as &quot;Original Dixieland Jazz Band&quot;. In early 1936 Nick LaRocca and Larry Shields reunited in New Orleans for a hotel date. Encouraged by the response, they continued to play local clubs and private functions. LaRocca, gauging the audiences for dance-band music, listened to the latest swing records and decided that the ODJB could appeal to those listeners as well. He assembled a 14-piece swing band featuring four members of the ODJB: himself, Larry Shields, J. Russel Robinson, and Tony Sbarbaro. &quot;Nick LaRocca and The Original Dixieland Band&quot; recorded nine sides for Victor in September 1936. Trade columnists welcomed these new big-band versions of the old hits, with the technological advance of electrical recording (with microphones) yielding a tremendous improvement in fidelity over the old acoustic recordings. Clarinetist Larry Shields received particularly positive attention: &quot;It is here that one of the all too few opportunities to hear and judge Shields by himself is found,&quot; wrote &quot;The Record Changer&quot;. &quot;It is Larry Shields who packs the punch, much as he did in the regular, smaller band.&quot; 

Eddie Edwards, the only ODJB member absent from the first big-band session on September 2, showed up at the studio toward the end of the second big-band session on September 25. The original quintet ran through &quot;Skeleton Jangle&quot; without the big band. The take went so well that Victor invited the quintet back into the studio to record five more songs on November 10, 1936. Victor credited these records to &quot;The Original Dixieland Five&quot; to avoid confusion with Victor&#x27;s &quot;Original Dixieland Band&quot; records then in circulation. Benny Goodman (who was present at the quintet&#x27;s Victor recording session) named Shields as an important early influence, and invited the band to appear on his network radio show, where the ODJB was a sensation. The band was booked into New York&#x27;s famous Paramount theater in April 1937, one month after Goodman&#x27;s spectacular showing at the Paramount. Victor even coupled the new Goodman recording of &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; with the Original Dixieland Five&#x27;s recording of &quot;Clarinet Marmalade&quot; on the same 78-rpm disc.

The ODJB reunion received widespread publicity, including a &quot;March of Time&quot; newsreel re-creating the group&#x27;s first recording session and showing their successful performance in Boston on December 31, 1936. J. Russel Robinson compared the band&#x27;s style to modern swing, which reporter Abel Green encapsulated: &quot;Swing is no different basically than the old Dixieland style. The sole difference is that today it is closer harmony, because it&#x27;s arranged. The arranger scores the supposed improvisations because otherwise it would sound like bedlam. When a small combo of four or five jams it out, no arrangement is necessary because each instrumentalist merely takes the chorus lead in sequence.&quot; 

Ken Murray, always a fan of bygone acts, hired the band in late 1936 for a tour of personal appearances. Bass violinist Harry Barth was added to the band in January 1937 for these stage shows. A &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer caught the Baltimore engagement and disapproved of Murray&#x27;s handling: &quot;Unfortunately boys aren&#x27;t getting the spotlight they deserve. They&#x27;re part of Murray&#x27;s act and, with two brief exceptions, there&#x27;s something in front of band [at] all times. To many, that old act has been mythical, especially in last year-and-half. Murray didn&#x27;t even adequately explain band&#x27;s background when intro&#x27;ing it. Comic should certainly take advantage of what he has in his own act.&quot;

After the stint with Murray, the band&#x27;s radio and stage appearances were now being arranged by veteran band booker and manager Ed Kirkeby. The band opened Billy Rose&#x27;s opulent Frontier Fiesta club in Fort Worth, Texas in July 1937. They played throughout the summer at the Dallas-Fort Worth Exposition, and returned to New York on October 1 for a booking at the Old New York nightclub. Toward the end of the tour, there were disagreements about LaRocca&#x27;s leadership; Harry Barth had left angrily on August 7 when he asked LaRocca for a raise and was refused. LaRocca and Edwards also argued back and forth. On January 17, 1938, LaRocca served notice on both the band members and the musicians&#x27; union in New York that the ODJB would be disbanding. The band officially broke up on February 1, 1938.

In the immediate aftermath, two factions competed as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. Edwards, Shields, and Sbarbaro had one more recording date with Victor on February 18, 1938; they were augmented by New York-area sidemen and vocalist Lola Bard. They recorded six songs for Victor&#x27;s Bluebird label, and the records were credited to the &quot;Original Dixieland Jazz Band with Shields, Edwards and Sbarbaro; vocal refrain by Lola Bard.&quot; The Edwards band toured the southern United States in the spring of 1938. Meanwhile the other two members, LaRocca and Robinson, had &quot;their own combo in New York&quot;.

Most of the ODJB veterans continued to work after Nick La Rocca retired completely from the musical scene. In November 1943 Tony Sbarbaro, claiming ownership of the ODJB name, brought back Eddie Edwards (and went after Larry Shields) to appear with the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in Sol Hurok&#x27;s stage production &quot;Tropical Review&quot; in Forrest, New York. In 1944, a new version of &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; was released as V-Disc 214, featuring Edwards and Sbarbaro under the ODJB name; &quot;Sensation Rag&quot; also was released as V-Disc 214B2. V-Discs were non-commercial recordings issued only to the U.S. armed forces. In 1946 Tony Sbarbaro (now using the name Tony Spargo) led a new eight-man group, &quot;The Emperors of Jazz&quot;, with ODJB alumnus Frank Signorelli on piano. J. Russel Robinson moved to California and continued to write songs, forming his own publishing company Southern California Music in 1952. 

In 1960 the book, &quot;The Story of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band&quot;, was published. Writer H. O. Brunn based it on Nick LaRocca&#x27;s recollections, which sometimes differ from that of other sources.

Of the veteran quintet, only Tony Sbarbaro lived to witness RCA Victor&#x27;s commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. Larry Shields died in 1953, Nick LaRocca in 1961, Eddie Edwards and J. Russel Robinson in 1963, and Tony Sbarbaro in 1969.

Back in New Orleans, LaRocca licensed bandleader Phil Zito to use the ODJB name for many years. Nick LaRocca&#x27;s son, Jimmy LaRocca, continues to lead bands under the name The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, which LaRocca the younger has trademarked.

==Influence==
The ODJB was the first band to record jazz successfully, establishing and creating jazz as a new musical idiom and genre of music. Bix Beiderbecke was influenced by the ODJB to become a jazz musician and was heavily influenced by Nick LaRocca&#x27;s cornet and trumpet style. Louis Armstrong acknowledged the importance of ODJB:

==Film appearances==

In 1917, the band made the first appearance of a jazz band in a motion picture, a silent movie entitled, &quot;The Good for Nothing&quot; (1917), directed by Carlyle Blackwell, who also played the lead role as Jack Burkshaw. Written by Alexander Thomas, it also featured Evelyn Greeley and Kate Lester and was produced by William Brady. Nick LaRocca, Larry Shields, Tony Sbarbaro, and Henry Ragas appeared in the film as a band, with LaRocca on cornet, Shields on clarinet, Ragas on piano, and Sbarbaro on drums. The film was released on December 10, 1917, produced by Peerless Productions, and distributed by World Pictures.

Nick LaRocca and the reunited Original Dixieland Jass Band performed &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; in &quot;The March of Time&quot; newsreel segment titled &quot;Birth of Swing&quot;, released to U.S. theaters on February 19, 1937.

==Music of ODJB==

===&quot;Tiger Rag&quot;===
The band&#x27;s 1917 composition &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; became one of the most popular and ubiquitous of jazz standards. There were 136 cover versions of ODJB&#x27;s copyright jazz standard and classic &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; by 1942. It has been standard ever since.

Their first release, &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot;, featured instruments doing barnyard imitations and the fully loaded trap set, wood blocks, cowbells, gongs, and Chinese gourds. This musical innovation represented one of the first experimental exercises in jazz. At the time, their music was liberating; the barnyard sounds were experiments in altering the tonal qualities of the instruments, and clattering wood blocks broke up the rhythm. The music was very lively when compared to the pop music of the time.

Many of the tunes first composed and recorded by the Original Dixieland Jass Band, such as &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; and &quot;Margie&quot;, were recorded by many of the major jazz bands and orchestras of the twentieth century, black and white. &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; was recorded by many artists, from Louis Armstrong to Duke Ellington to Glenn Miller to Benny Goodman. &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;, in particular, became popular with many colleges and universities having a tiger as a mascot. In the biography &quot;John Coltrane: His Life and Music&quot;, published in 1999, Lewis Porter noted that ODJB&#x27;s classic, &quot;Margie&quot;, was a &quot;specialty&quot; of John Coltrane, a song he performed regularly in his early career. &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;, &quot;Margie&quot;, &quot;Clarinet Marmalade&quot;, &quot;At The Jazz Band Ball&quot;, &quot;Sensation Rag&quot;, and &quot;Fidgety Feet&quot; remain much played classics in the repertory of contemporary Dixieland and traditional jazz bands. Their tunes were published as collaborations by some or all of the entire ensemble, including band leader Nick La Rocca.

The Original Dixieland Jazz Band recording of &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; was no. 1 for two weeks on the U.S. Hit Parade charts beginning on December 11, 1918. The Mills Brothers recorded &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; in 1931 with lyrics and spent four weeks at no. 1 on the charts in 1931–1932 with their version of the ODJB song.

The Eddie Edwards composition &quot;Sensation Rag&quot; (aka &quot;Sensation&quot;) was performed at the 1938 landmark Benny Goodman jazz concert at Carnegie Hall released on the album &quot;The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert&quot;.

Compared to later jazz, the ODJB recordings have only modest improvisation in mostly ensemble tunes. Clarinetist Larry Shields is perhaps the most interesting player, showing a good fluid tone, and if his melodic variations and breaks now seem overly familiar, this is because they were imitated widely by musicians who followed in the band&#x27;s footsteps.

Their concept of arrangement was somewhat limited, and their recordings can seem rather repetitive. The lack of a bass player is scarcely compensated for by the piano on their earlier, acoustically recorded sessions. Nonetheless, ODJB arrangements were wild, impolite, and definitely had a jazz feel, and that style still is referred to as the style of music known as Dixieland.

===Covers===

==Honors==
In 1977, the ODJB classic &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, co-written by ODJB pianist J. Russel Robinson, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in a landmark 1927 recording by Frankie Trumbauer and His Orchestra featuring Bix Beiderbecke on cornet and Eddie Lang on guitar, as Okeh 40772-B, recorded on February 4, 1927.

On April 3, 1992, the City Council of New Orleans issued a proclamation honoring the members of the band. In 2003, the 1918 ODJB recording of &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; was placed on the U.S. Library of Congress National Recording Registry. In 2006, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band&#x27;s recording of &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot;, released in 1917 as Columbia single A2297, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The Original Dixieland Jazz Band was posthumously inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have &quot;qualitative or historical significance&quot;.

<text>In economics, the free-rider problem is a type of market failure that occurs when those who benefit from resources, public goods and common pool resources do not pay for them or under-pay. Free riders may overuse common pool resources by not paying for them, neither directly through fees or tolls, nor indirectly through taxes. Consequently, the common pool resource may be under-produced, overused, or degraded. Additionally, despite evidence that people tend to be cooperative by nature (a prosocial behaviour), the presence of free-riders has been shown to cause cooperation to deteriorate, perpetuating the free-rider problem.

In social science, the free-rider problem is the question of how to limit free riding and its negative effects in these situations, such as the free-rider problem of when property rights are not clearly defined and imposed. The free-rider problem is common with public goods which are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. The non-excludability and non-rivalry of public goods results in there being little incentive for consumers to contribute to a collective resource as they enjoy its benefits.

A free rider may enjoy a non-excludable and non-rivalrous good such as a government-provided road system without contributing to paying for it. Another example is if a coastal town builds a lighthouse, ships from many regions and countries will benefit from it, even though they are not contributing to its costs, and are thus &quot;free riding&quot; on the navigation aid. A third example of non-excludable and non-rivalrous consumption would be a crowd watching fireworks. The number of viewers, whether they paid for the entertainment or not, does not diminish the fireworks as a resource. In each of these examples, the cost of excluding non-payers would be prohibitive, while the collective consumption of the resource does not decrease how much is available.

Although the term &quot;free rider&quot; was first used in economic theory of public goods, similar concepts have been applied to other contexts, including collective bargaining, antitrust law, psychology, political science, and vaccines. For example, some individuals in a team or community may reduce their contributions or performance if they believe that one or more other members of the group may free ride.

The economic free-rider problem is equally pertinent within the realm of global politics, often presenting challenges in international cooperation and collective action. In global politics, states are confronted with scenarios where certain actors reap the benefits of collective goods or actions without bearing the costs or contributing to the efforts required to achieve these shared objectives. This phenomenon creates imbalances and hampers cooperative endeavors, particularly in addressing transnational challenges like climate change, global security, or humanitarian crises. For instance, in discussions on climate change mitigation, countries with lesser contributions to greenhouse gas emissions might still benefit from global efforts to reduce emissions, enjoying a stable climate without proportionally shouldering the costs of emission reductions. This creates a disparity between states&#x27; contributions and their gains, leading to challenges in negotiating and implementing effective international agreements. The economic free-rider problem&#x27;s manifestation in global politics underscores the complexities and obstacles encountered in fostering collective action and equitable burden-sharing among nations to address pressing global issues.

==Incentive==
The underlying incentive which generates the free-rider problem can be explained via the application of the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma within the context of contributing to a public good. Suppose two people were to split a contribution to a public service (such as for a fire station) with society benefiting from their contribution. According to the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, certain conclusions can be drawn from the results of this scenario:
* If both parties donate, they both do so out of pocket, and society benefits.
* If one party doesn&#x27;t pay (in the hopes that someone else will), they become a free-rider, and the other will have to cover the cost.
* If the other party also decides to become a free-rider and not pay either, then society receives no benefit.

This demonstrates that the free-rider problem is generated by individuals&#x27; willingness to let others pay when they themselves can receive the benefit at zero cost. This is reinforced by the economic theory of rational choice, which states that people make choices which they infer will provide them with the greatest benefit. Therefore, if a service or resource is offered for free, then a consumer will not pay for it.

== Economic issues ==
Free riding is a problem of economic inefficiency when it leads to the underproduction or overconsumption of a good. For example, when people are asked how much they value a particular public good, with that value measured in terms of how much money they would be willing to pay, their tendency is to under-report their valuations. Goods that are subject to free riding are usually characterized by: the inability to exclude non-payers, its consumption by an individual does not impact the availability for others and that the resource in question must be produced and/or maintained. Indeed, if non-payers can be excluded by some mechanism, the good may be transformed into a club good (e.g. if an overused, congested public road is converted to a toll road, or if a free public museum turns into a private, admission fee-charging museum).

Free riders become a problem when non-excludable goods are also rivalrous. These goods, categorized as common-pool resources, are characterized by overconsumption when common property regimes are not implemented. Not only can consumers of common-property goods benefit without payment, but consumption by one imposes an opportunity cost on others. The theory of &#x27;Tragedy of the commons&#x27; highlights this, in which each consumer acts to maximize their own utility and thereby relies on others to cut back their own consumption. This will lead to overconsumption and even possibly exhaustion or destruction of the good. If too many people start to free ride, a system or service will eventually not have enough resources to operate. Free-riding is experienced when the production of goods does not consider the external costs, particularly the use of ecosystem services.

An example of this is global climate change initiatives. As climate change is a global issue and there is no global regime to manage the climate, the benefits of reduced emissions in one country will extend beyond their own countries&#x27; borders and impact countries worldwide. However, this has resulted in some countries acting in their own self-interest, limiting their own efforts and free-riding on the work of others. In some countries, citizens and governments do not wish to contribute to the associated effort and costs of mitigation, as they are able to free-ride on the efforts of others. This free rider problem also raises questions in regards to the fairness and ethics of these practices, as countries most likely to suffer the consequences of climate change, are also those who typically emit the least greenhouse gases and have fewer economic resources to contribute to the efforts, such as the small island country of Tuvalu.

Theodore Groves and John Ledyard believe that Pareto-optimal allocation of resources in relation to public goods is not compatible with the fundamental incentives belonging to individuals. Therefore, the free-rider problem, according to most scholars, is expected to be an ongoing public issue. For example, Albert O. Hirschman believed that the free-rider problem is a cyclical one for capitalist economies. Hirschman considers the free-rider problem to be related to the shifting interests of people. When stress levels rise on individuals in the workplace and many fear losing their employment, they devote less of their human capital to the public sphere. When public needs then increase, disenchanted consumers become more interested in collective action projects. This leads individuals to organize themselves in various groups and the results are attempts to solve public problems. In effect this reverses the momentum of free riding. Activities often seen as costs in models focused on self-interest are instead seen as benefits for the individuals who were previously dissatisfied consumers seeking their private interests.

This cycle will reset itself because as individuals&#x27; work for public benefit becomes less praiseworthy, supporters&#x27; level of commitment to collective action projects will decrease. With the decrease in support, many will return to private interests, which with time resets the cycle. Supporters of Hirschman&#x27;s model insist that the important factor in motivating people is that they are compelled by a leader&#x27;s call to altruism. In John F. Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural address he implored the American people to &quot;ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&quot; Some economists (for example, Milton Friedman) find these calls to altruism to be nonsensical. Scholars like Friedman do not think the free-rider problem is part of an unchangeable virtuous or vicious circle, but instead seek possible solutions or attempts at improvement elsewhere.

== Economic and political solutions ==
=== Assurance contracts ===
An assurance contract is a contract in which participants make a binding pledge to contribute to building a public good, contingent on a quorum of a predetermined size being reached, otherwise the good is not provided and any monetary contributions are refunded.

A dominant assurance contract is a variation in which an entrepreneur creates the contract and refunds the initial pledge plus an additional sum of money if the quorum is not reached. The entrepreneur profits by collecting a fee if the quorum is reached and the good is provided. In terms of game theory, this makes pledging to build the public good a dominant strategy: the best move is to abide by the contract regardless of the actions of others.

=== Coasian solution ===
A Coasian solution, named for the economist Ronald Coase, proposes that potential beneficiaries of a public good can negotiate to pool their resources and create it, based on each party&#x27;s self-interested willingness to pay. His treatise, &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; (1960), argued that if the transaction costs between potential beneficiaries of a public good are low—that it is easy for potential beneficiaries to find each other and organize pooling their resources based upon the good&#x27;s value to each of them—that public goods could be produced without government action.

Much later, Coase himself wrote that while what had become known as the Coase Theorem had explored the implications of zero-transaction costs, he had actually intended to use this construct as a stepping stone to understand the real world of positive transaction costs, corporations, legal systems and government actions:I examined what would happen in a world in which transaction costs were assumed to be zero. My aim in doing so was not to describe what life would be like in such a world but to provide a simple setting in which to develop the analysis and, what was even more important, to make clear the fundamental role which transaction costs do, and should, play in the fashioning of the institutions which make up the economic system.Coase also wrote:The world of zero transaction costs has often been described as a Coasian world. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is the world of modern economic theory, one which I was hoping to persuade economists to leave. What I did in &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; was simply to shed light on some of its properties. I argued in such a world the allocation of resources would be independent of the legal position, a result which Stigler dubbed the &quot;Coase theorem&quot;.

Thus, while Coase himself appears to have considered the &quot;Coase theorem&quot; and Coasian solutions as simplified constructs to ultimately consider the real 20th-century world of governments, laws, and corporations, these concepts have become attached to a world where transaction costs were much lower and government intervention would unquestionably be less necessary.

====Fundraising====

A minor alternative, especially for information goods, is for the producer to refuse to release a good to the public until payment to cover costs is met. For instance, Stephen King authored chapters of a new novel downloadable for free on his website while stating that he would not release subsequent chapters unless a certain amount of money was raised. Sometimes dubbed &quot;holding for ransom&quot;, this method of public goods production is a modern application of the street performer protocol for public goods production. Unlike assurance contracts, its success relies largely on social norms to ensure (to some extent) that the threshold is reached and partial contributions are not wasted.

One of the purest Coasian solutions today is the new phenomenon of Internet crowdfunding, in which case rules are enforced by computer algorithms and legal contracts, as well as social pressure. For example, on the Kickstarter site, each funder authorizes a credit card purchase to buy a new product or receive other promised benefits, but no money changes hands until the funding goal is met. Because automation and the Internet greatly reduce the transaction costs for pooling resources, project goals of only a few hundred dollars are frequently crowdfunded, far below the costs of soliciting traditional investors.

=== Introducing an exclusion mechanism (club goods) ===

Another solution, which has evolved for information goods, is to introduce exclusion mechanisms which turn public goods into club goods. One well-known example is copyright and patent laws. These laws, which in the 20th century came to be called intellectual property laws, attempt to remove the natural non-excludability by prohibiting reproduction of the good. Although they can address the free rider problem, the downside of these laws is that they imply private monopoly power and thus are not Pareto-optimal.

For example, in the United States, the patent rights given to pharmaceutical companies encourage them to charge high prices (above marginal cost) and to advertise to convince patients to persuade their doctors to prescribe the drugs. Likewise, copyright provides an incentive for publishers to take older works out of print so as not to cannibalize revenue from newer works. An example from the entertainment industry is Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;vault&quot; sales practice, and an example from the technology industry is Microsoft&#x27;s decision to pull Windows XP from the market in mid-2008 to drive revenue from the widely criticized Windows Vista operating system.

Intellectual property laws also end up encouraging patent and copyright owners to sue even mild imitators in court and to lobby for the extension of the term of the exclusive rights in a form of rent seeking.

These problems with the club-good mechanism arise because the underlying marginal cost of giving the good to more people is low or zero, but because of the limits of price discrimination, those who are unwilling or unable to pay a profit-maximizing price do not gain access to the good. If the costs of the exclusion mechanism are not higher than the gain from the collaboration, club goods can emerge naturally. James M. Buchanan showed in his seminal paper that clubs can be an efficient alternative to government interventions.

On the other hand, the inefficiencies and inequities of club goods exclusions sometimes cause potentially excludable club goods to be treated as public goods, and their production financed by some other mechanism. This explains why many such goods, often known as &quot;social goods&quot;, are often provided or subsidized by governments, co-operatives, or volunteer associations, rather than being left to be supplied by profit-minded entrepreneurs.

Joseph Schumpeter claimed that the &quot;excess profits&quot; (or profits over normal profit) generated by the copyright or patent monopoly will attract competitors that would make technological innovations and thereby end the monopoly. This is a continual process referred to as &quot;Schumpeterian creative destruction&quot;, and its applicability to different types of public goods is a source of some controversy. Supporters of the theory point to cases such as that of Microsoft, which has been increasing its prices (or lowering its products&#x27; quality), predicting that these practices will make increased market shares for Linux and Apple largely inevitable.

A nation can be considered akin to a club whose members are its citizens. The government would then be the manager of this club. This is further studied in the theory of the state.

===Non-altruistic social sanctions (common property regimes)===
Often on the foundation of game theory, experimental literature suggests that free-riding situations can be improved without any state intervention by seeking to measure the effects of various forms of social sanctions. Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, when members sanction other members that do not contribute to the common pool resource by inflicting a cost on &quot;free-riders&quot;, is considered sufficient to establish and maintain cooperation.

Social actions come at a cost to the punisher, which discourages individuals from taking action to punish the free-rider. Therefore, punishers often need to be rewarded for following through with their punishment for the resource to be effectively managed. Unlike a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma where the prisoners are prohibited from communicating and strategizing, people can get together to form &quot;common property regimes&quot; in which the group weighs the costs and benefits of rewarding individuals for sanctioning free riders. So long as the benefits of preserving the resource outweigh the cost of communication and enforcement, members often compensate punishers for sanctioning free riders. While the outcome is not Pareto-optimal, as the group has the additional cost of paying for enforcement, it is often less costly than letting the resource deplete. In the limiting case, where the costs of bargaining and enforcement approach zero, the setup becomes Coasian as the solution approaches the Pareto-optimal solution.

Both punishment and regulation by the state work relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of others.
 Often common property regimes which members establish through bargaining have more information about the specific common pool resource which they are managing than outsiders. For this reason, and because common property regimes can avoid the principal-agent problem, the specific local knowledge within common property regimes typically enables them to outperform regulations designed by outside technical experts. Nevertheless, the best performance is typically achieved when people in common property regimes consult with governments and technical experts while deciding on the rules and design of their firm, thereby combining local and technical knowledge.

== Altruistic solutions ==

=== Social norms ===
Psychologically, humans are fundamentally considered as free-riders by others only when benefits are consumed while contributions are withheld. Indicating that in all cultures free-riders are recognised, however, cultural differences exist in the degree of tolerance and how these people dealt with them. The impact of social norms on the free-rider problem differs between cultural contexts, which may lead to a variance between results in research on the free-rider problem when applied cross-culturally. Social norms impact on privately and voluntarily provided public goods; however, is considered to have some level of effect on the problem in many contexts. Social sanctioning, for example, is a norm in and of itself that has a high degree of universality. The goal of much research on the topic of social sanctioning and its effect on the free-rider problem is to explain the altruistic motivation that is observed in various societies.

Free riding is often thought of only in terms of positive and negative externalities felt by the public. The impact of social norms on actions and motivations related to altruism are often underestimated in economic solutions and the models from which they are derived.

=== Altruistic social sanctions ===
While non-altruistic social sanctions occur when people establish common property regimes, people sometimes punish free-riders even without being rewarded. The exact nature of motivation remains to be explored. Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed. Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective in real world environments.

Other research finds that social sanctions cannot be generalized as strategic in the context of public goods. Preferences between secret sanctions (untraceable sanctions between players in the game) and standard sanctions (traceable sanctions including feedback between players in an otherwise identical environment) on free riders did not vary significantly. Rather some individuals preferred to sanction others regardless of secrecy. Other research build on the findings of behavioral economics, finds that in a dilemmatic donation game, donators are motivated by the fear of loss. In the game donators&#x27; deposits were only refunded if the donators always punish free riding and non-commitment among other individuals. Pool-punishment (everyone loses their deposit if one donator doesn&#x27;t punish the free rider) provided more stable results than punishment without consideration of the consensus of the group. Individual-to-individual peer punishment led to less consistently applied social sanctions. Collectively this research, although it is experimental in nature, may prove useful when applied in public policy decisions seeking to improve free-rider problems within society.

<doc id="52221" wikidata="Q5172508" url="?curid=52221" title="Corporate welfare">
<text>Corporate welfare refers to government financial assistance, subsidies, tax breaks, or other favorable policies provided to private businesses or specific industries, ostensibly to promote economic growth, job creation, or other public benefits. This support can take various forms, including tax credits, tax deductions, tax exemptions, government contracts, preferential regulatory treatment, debt write-offs, public-private partnerships, bailout programs, discount schemes, deferrals, low-interest loans or loan guarantees, direct subsidies or public grants.

The definition of corporate welfare is sometimes restricted to direct government subsidies of major corporations, excluding tax loopholes and all manner of regulatory and trade decisions.

== Origin of term ==
The term &quot;corporate welfare&quot; was reportedly coined in 1956 by Ralph Nader.

== Alternative adages ==
=== &quot;Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor&quot; ===

Believed to have been first popularised by Michael Harrington&#x27;s 1962 book &quot;The Other America&quot; in which Harrington cited Charles Abrams, a noted authority on housing.

Variations on this adage have been used in criticisms of the United States&#x27; economic policy by Joe Biden, Martin Luther King Jr., Gore Vidal, Joseph P. Kennedy II, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Dean Baker, Noam Chomsky, Robert Reich, John Pilger, Bernie Sanders, and Yanis Varoufakis.

=== &quot;Privatizing profits and socializing losses&quot; ===
&quot;Privatizing profits and socializing losses&quot; refers to the idea that corporations want to reserve financial gains for themselves and pass along losses to the rest of society, potentially through lobbying the government for assistance. This practice was criticized in the Wall Street bailout of 2008.

== By country ==
=== United States ===

==== Background ====
Subsidies considered excessive, unwarranted, wasteful, unfair, inefficient, or bought by lobbying are often called corporate welfare. The label of corporate welfare is often used to decry projects advertised as benefiting the general welfare that spend a disproportionate amount of funds on large corporations, and often in uncompetitive, or anti-competitive ways. For instance, in the United States, agricultural subsidies are usually portrayed as helping independent farmers stay afloat. In actuality, the majority of income gained from commodity support programs has gone to large agribusiness corporations such as Archer Daniels Midland, as they own a considerably larger percentage of production.

Alan Peters and Peter Fisher, Associate Professors at the University of Iowa, have estimated that state and local governments provide $40–50 billion annually in economic development incentives, which critics characterize as corporate welfare.

Multiple economists have considered the 2008 bank bailouts in the United States to be a form of corporate welfare. U.S. politicians have also contended that zero-interest loans from the Federal Reserve System to financial institutions during and after the financial crisis of 2007–2008 were a hidden, backdoor form of corporate welfare. The term gained increased prominence in 2018 when Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a bill, singling out Amazon and Walmart in particular, to require a company with 500 or more employees to pay the full cost of welfare benefits received by its workers.

==== Comprehensive analyses ====
===== Independent =====
Daniel D. Huff, professor emeritus of social work at Boise State University, published a comprehensive analysis of corporate welfare in 1993. Huff reasoned that a very conservative estimate of corporate welfare expenditures in the United States would have been at least in 1990. Huff compared this number with social welfare:
Huff argued that deliberate obfuscation was a complicating factor.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 2015, Kevin Farnsworth, a senior lecturer in Social Policy at the University of York published a paper in which he claimed that the government was providing corporate subsidies of £93 billion. This amount includes the role of the government in increasing trade, tax relief for businesses that invest in new plants and machinery (estimated by Farnsworth at £20 billion), not charging fuel duty on fuel used by railways or airlines, green energy subsidies, a lower corporation tax rate for small companies, regional development grants and government procurement for businesses (which Farnsworth suggests often favours British businesses even when these are not the best value option available). However, &quot;The Register&quot; wrote that Farnsworth&#x27;s figure for tax relief for investment was incorrect and that he had made mistakes in his calculations, noting that he was not an accountant. It also stated that not charging businesses taxes under certain circumstances (when the reliefs applied) was not the same as giving them a subsidy. Fuel duty is not charged on airlines due to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (a UN agency) which specifies that aeroplanes should be exempt from fuel duties.

==== Political discussion ====
In 2015, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would &quot;strip out&quot; the £93bn of &quot;corporate tax relief and subsidies&quot; Farnsworth referred to and use the proceeds for public investment. Corbyn did not say which specific policies he would change. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote the policy &quot;sounds wonderful, but careful scrutiny of &#x27;corporate welfare&#x27; shows that it includes capital allowances designed to persuade companies to invest, regional aid to boost growth in rundown parts of the UK, and subsidies to keep bus and rail routes open – none of which Corbyn would presumably like to see stopped.&quot;

=== Canada ===
The New Democratic Party in Canada picked up the term as a major theme in its 1972 federal election campaign. Its leader, David Lewis, used the term in the title of his 1972 book, &quot;Louder Voices: The Corporate Welfare Bums&quot;.

The Reform Party and its successor the Canadian Alliance were known for opposing most business subsidies, but after their merger with the Progressive Conservative party, they dropped their opposition.

=== India ===
It was observed by &quot;The Wire&quot; that the effective tax rate was low for the larger corporations which meant companies making smaller profits are competing in an unequal environment against bigger companies with substantial taxation benefits, with the gap in effective tax rates widening over the years. Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi criticised this practice, saying:

<doc id="52222" wikidata="Q231392" url="?curid=52222" title="Kingdom of Asturias">
<text>The Kingdom of Asturias was a kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula founded by the Visigothic nobleman Pelagius. It was the first Christian political entity to be established in the Iberian Peninsula after the Umayyad conquest of Visigothic Hispania in 711-718. In the Summer of 722, Pelagius defeated an Umayyad army at the Battle of Covadonga, in what is retroactively regarded as the beginning of the Christian &quot;Reconquista&quot;.

The Asturian kings would occasionally make peace with the Muslims, particularly at times when they needed to pursue their other enemies, mainly rebel Basques and Galicians. Thus Fruela I (757–768) fought Muslims but also defeated the Basques and Galicians, and Silo (774–783) made peace with the Muslims but not with the Galicians. Under King Alfonso II (791–842), the kingdom was firmly established with Alfonso&#x27;s recognition as king of Asturias by Charlemagne and the Pope. He conquered Galicia and the Basques. During his reign, the holy bones of St James the Great were declared to be found in Galicia, in Compostela (from Latin &quot;campus stellae&quot;, literally &quot;the field of the star&quot;). Pilgrims from all over Europe opened a way of communication between the isolated Asturias and the Carolingian lands and beyond. Alfonso&#x27;s policy consisted in depopulating the borders of Bardulia (which would turn into Castile) in order to gain population support north of the mountains. With this growth came a corresponding increase in military forces. The kingdom was now strong enough to sack the Moorish cities of Lisbon, Zamora and Coimbra. However, for centuries to come the focus of these actions was not conquest but pillage and tribute. In the summers of 792, 793 and 794 several Muslim attacks plundered Alava, and the heart of the Asturian kingdom, reaching up to the capital, Oviedo. In one of the retreats, Alfonso inflicted a severe defeat on the Muslims in the swampy area of Lutos.

When Alfonso II died, Ramiro I (842–50) staged a coup against the &quot;Count of the Palace&quot; Nepotian, who had taken the throne. After a battle on a bridge over the river Narcea, Nepotian was captured in flight, blinded and then forced into monastic life. Early in his reign, in 844, Ramiro was faced with a Viking attack at a place called &quot;Farum Brecantium&quot;, believed to be present-day Corunna. He gathered an army in Galicia and Asturias and defeated the Vikings, killing many of them and burning their ships. In 859, a second Viking fleet set out for Spain. The Vikings were slaughtered off the coast of Galicia by Count Pedro. The considerable territorial expansion of the Asturian kingdom under Alfonso III (866–910) was largely made possible by the collapse of Umayyad control over many parts of Al-Andalus at this time. Between in the year 773 the western frontier of the kingdom in Galicia was expanded into the northern part of modern-day Portugal pushing the border roughly to the Douro valley, and between 868 and 881 it expanded further south reaching all the way to the Mondego. The year 878 saw a Muslim assault on the towns of Astorga and León. The expedition consisted of two detachments, one of which was decisively defeated at Polvoraria on the river Órbigo, with an alleged loss of 13,000 men. In 881, Alfonso took the offensive, leading an army deep into the Lower March, crossing the Tagus River to approach Mérida. Then miles from the city the Asturian army crossed the Guadiana River and defeated the Umayyad army on &quot;Monte Oxifer&quot;, allegedly leaving 15,000 Muslim soldiers killed. Returning home, Alfonso devoted himself to building the churches of Oviedo and constructing one or two more palaces for himself.

The Kingdom of Asturias transitioned into the Kingdom of León in 924, when Fruela II of Asturias became king with his royal court in León.

== Indigenous background ==

The kingdom originated in the western and central territory of the Cantabrian Mountains, particularly the Picos de Europa and the central area of Asturias. The main political and military events during the first decades of the kingdom&#x27;s existence took place in the region. According to the descriptions of Strabo, Cassius Dio and other Graeco-Roman geographers, several peoples of Celtic origin inhabited the lands of Asturias at the beginning of the Christian era, most notably:

*in the Cantabri, the &quot;Vadinienses&quot;, who inhabited the Picos de Europa region and whose settlement gradually expanded southward during the first centuries of the modern era
*the &quot;Orgenomesci&quot;, who dwelled along the Asturian eastern coast
*in the Astures, the &quot;Saelini&quot;, whose settlement extended through the Sella Valley
*the &quot;Luggones&quot;, who had their capital in &quot;Lucus Asturum&quot; and whose territories stretched between the Sella and Nalón
*the &quot;Astures&quot; (in the strictest sense), who dwelled in inner Asturias, between the current councils of Piloña and Cangas del Narcea
*the &quot;Paesici&quot;, who had settled along the coast of Western Asturias, between the mouth of the Navia river and the modern city of Gijón

Classical geographers give conflicting views of the ethnic description of the above-mentioned peoples. Ptolemy says that the Astures extended along the central area of current Asturias, between the Navia and Sella rivers, fixing the latter river as the boundary with the Cantabrian territory. However, other geographers placed the frontier between the Astures and the Cantabri further to the east: Julius Honorius stated in his &quot;Cosmographia&quot; that the springs of the river Ebro were located in the land of the Astures (&quot;sub asturibus&quot;). In any case, ethnic borders in the Cantabrian Mountains were not so important after that time, as the clan divisions that permeated the pre-Roman societies of all the peoples of Northern Iberia faded under similar political administrative culture imposed on them by the Romans.

The situation started to change during the Late Roman Empire and the early Middle Ages, when an Asturian identity gradually started to develop: the centuries-old fight between Visigothic and Suebian nobles may have helped to forge a distinct identity among the peoples of the Cantabrian districts. Several archaeological digs in the &quot;castro&quot; of La Carisa (municipality of Lena) have found remnants of a defensive line whose main purpose was to protect the valleys of central Asturias from invaders who came from the Meseta through the Pajares pass: the construction of these fortifications reveals a high degree of organization and cooperation among the several Asturian communities, in order to defend themselves from the southern invaders. Carbon-14 tests have found that the wall dates from the period 675–725 AD, when two armed expeditions against the Asturians took place: one of them headed by Visigothic king Wamba (reigned 672–680); the other by Muslim governor Musa bin Nusayr during the Umayyad conquest, who settled garrisons over its territory.

The gradual formation of Asturian identity led to the creation of the Kingdom of Asturias after Pelagius&#x27; coronation and the victory over the Muslim garrisons in Covadonga in the early 8th century. The &quot;Chronica Albeldense&quot;, in narrating the happenings of Covadonga, stated that &quot;Divine providence brings forth the King of Asturias&quot;.

== Umayyad occupation and Asturian revolt ==

The kingdom was established by the nobleman Pelayo (), possibly an Asturian noble. No substantial movement of refugees from central Iberia could have taken place before the Battle of Covadonga, and in 714 Asturias was overrun by Musa bin Nusayr with no effective or known opposition. It has also been claimed that he may have retired to the Asturian mountains after the Battle of Guadalete, where in the Gothic tradition of Theias he was elected by the other nobles as leader of the Astures. Pelayo&#x27;s kingdom was initially a rallying banner for existing guerilla forces.

In the progress of the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the main cities and administrative centers fell into the hands of Muslim troops. Control of the central and southern regions, such as the Guadalquivir and Ebro valleys, presented few problems for the newcomers, who used the existing Visigothic administrative structures, ultimately of Roman origin. However, in the northern mountains, urban centers (such as Gijón) were practically nonexistent and the submission of the mountainous country had to be achieved valley by valley. Muslim troops often resorted to the taking of hostages to ensure the pacification of the newly conquered territory.

After the first incursion of Tarik, who reached Toledo in 711, the Yemeni viceroy of Ifriqiya, Musa bin Nusayr, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar the following year and carried out a massive operation of conquest that would lead to the capture of Mérida, Toledo, Zaragoza and Lerida, among other cities. During the last phase of his military campaign, he reached the northwest of the Peninsula, where he gained control of the localities of Astorga and Gijón. In the latter city, he placed a small Berber detachment under a governor, Munuza, whose mission was to consolidate Muslim control over Asturias. As a guarantee of the submission of the region, some nobles – some argue that Pelayo was among them – had to surrender hostages from Asturias to Cordoba. The legend says that his sister was asked for, and a marriage alliance sought with the local Berber leader. Later on, Munuza would try to do the same at another mountain post in the Pyrenees, where he rebelled against his Cordoban Arab superiors. The Berbers had been converted to Islam barely a generation earlier, and were considered second rank to Arabs and Syrians. 

The most commonly accepted hypothesis for the battle (epic as described by later Christian Asturian sources, but a mere skirmish in Muslim texts) is that the Moorish column was attacked from the cliffs and then fell back through the valleys towards present day Gijón, but it was attacked in retreat by the retinue and nearly destroyed. However, the only near-contemporary account of the events of the time, the Christian Chronicle of 754, makes no mention of the incident.

However, as is told in the &quot;Rotensian Chronicle&quot; as well as in that of Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari, Pelayo escaped from Cordoba during the governorship of al-Hurr (717–718) and his return to Asturias triggered a revolt against the Muslim authorities of Gijón. The identity of Pelayo, however, is still an open subject, and that is only one of the theories. The leader of the Astures, whose origin is debated by historians, lived at that time in Bres, in the district of Piloña, and Munuza sent his troops there under al-Qama. After receiving word of the arrival of the Muslims, Pelayo and his companions hurriedly crossed the Piloña and headed toward the narrow, easily defended valley of Mt. Auseva, taking refuge in one of its caves, Covadonga. After an attempted siege was abandoned due to the weather and the exposed position of the deep valley gorge, the troops are said to have exited through the high ports to the south, in order to continue their search-and-destroy mission against other rebels. There, the locals were able to ambush the Muslim detachment, which was nearly annihilated. The few survivors continued south to the plains of Leon, leaving the maritime districts of Asturias exposed.

The victory, relatively small, as only a few Berber soldiers were involved, resulted in great prestige for Pelayo and provoked a massive insurrection by other nobles in Galicia and Asturias who immediately rallied around him, electing him King or military Dux.

Under Pelayo&#x27;s leadership, the attacks on the Berbers increased. Munuza, feeling isolated in a region increasingly hostile, decided to abandon Gijón and headed for the Plateau (&quot;Meseta&quot;) through the Mesa Trail. However, he was intercepted and killed by Astures at Olalíes (in the current district of Grado). Once he had expelled the Moors from the eastern valleys of Asturias, Pelayo attacked León, the main city in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, and secured the mountain passes, insulating the region from Moorish attack. Pelayo continued attacking those Berbers who remained north of the Asturian Mountains until they withdrew, but the latter mostly deserted their garrisons in response to the wider rebellion against Arab control from Cordoba. He then married his daughter, Ermesinda, to Alfonso, the son of Peter of Cantabria, the leading noble at the still-independent Visigothic duchy of Cantabria. His son Favila was married to Froiliuba.

Recent archaeological excavations have found fortifications in Mount Homon and La Carisa (near the Huerna and Pajares valleys) dated between the end of the seventh and beginning of the eighth centuries. The Berber fortifications included watchtowers and moats of almost two meters, in whose construction and defense many hundreds may have participated. That would have required a high degree of organization and firm leadership, probably by Pelayo himself. Therefore, experts consider it probable that the construction of the defensive line was intended to prevent the reentry of Moors into Asturias through the mountain passes of Mesa and Pajares.
After Pelayo&#x27;s victory over the Moorish detachment at the Battle of Covadonga, a small territorial independent entity was established in the Asturian mountains that was the origin of the kingdom of Asturias. Pelayo&#x27;s leadership was not comparable to that of the Visigothic kings. The first kings of Asturias referred to themselves as &quot;princeps&quot; (prince) and later as &quot;rex&quot; (king), but the later title was not firmly established until the period of Alfonso II. The title of &quot;princeps&quot; had been used by the indigenous peoples of Northern Spain and its use appears in Galician and Cantabrian inscriptions, in which expressions like &quot;Nícer, Príncipe de los Albiones&quot; (on an inscription found in the district of Coaña) and &quot;princeps cantabrorum&quot; (over a gravestone of the municipality of Cistierna, in Leon). In fact, the Kingdom of Asturias originated as a focus of leadership over other peoples of the Cantabrian Coast that had resisted the Romans as well as the Visigoths and that were not willing to subject themselves to the dictates of the Umayyad Caliphate. Immigrants from the south, fleeing from Al-Andalus, brought a Gothic influence to the Asturian kingdom. However, at the beginning of the 9th century, Alfonso II&#x27;s will cursed the Visigoths, blaming them for the loss of Hispania. The later chronicles on which knowledge of the period is based, all written during the reign of Alfonso III, when there was great Gothic ideological influence, are the Sebastianensian Chronicle (&quot;Crónica Sebastianense&quot;), the Albeldensian Chronicle (&quot;Crónica Albeldense&quot;) and the Rotensian Chronicle (&quot;Crónica Rotense&quot;).

During the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax and so it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelayo&#x27;s daughter, was married to Alfonso, Dux Peter of Cantabria&#x27;s son. Alfonso&#x27;s son Fruela married Munia, a Basque princess from Alava, while his daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.

After Pelayo&#x27;s death in 737, his son Favila (or &quot;Fafila&quot;) was elected king. Fafila, according to the chronicles, was unexpectedly killed by a bear while hunting in one of the trials of courage normally required of the nobility of that era. However, there is no other such incident known from the long history of monarchs and others at the sport, and the case is suspiciously similar to the Roman legend of their first king, Romulus, taken by a sudden storm. The immediate consequence was that the rule of the Asturians passed to his brother-in-law, ruler of the neighboring independent domain, through a marriage alliance to Fafila&#x27;s sister. The female ties and rights of inheritance were still respected, and in later cases would allow the regency or crown for their husbands too.

Pelayo founded a dynasty in Asturias that survived for decades and gradually expanded the kingdom&#x27;s boundaries, until all of northwest Iberia was included by . The reign of Alfonso II from 791 to 842 saw further expansion of the kingdom to the south, almost as far as Lisbon.

== Initial expansion ==
Favila was succeeded by Alfonso I, who inherited the throne of Asturias thanks to his marriage to Pelayo&#x27;s daughter, Ermesinda. The &quot;Albeldensian Chronicle&quot; narrated how Alfonso arrived in the kingdom some time after the battle of Covadonga to marry Ermesinda. Favila&#x27;s death made his access to the throne possible as well as the rise of one of the most powerful families in the Kingdom of Asturias, the House of Cantabria. Initially, only Alfonso moved to the court in Cangas de Onís, but, after the progressive depopulation of the plateau and the Middle Valley of the Ebro, where the main strongholds of the Duchy of Cantabria (e.g., Amaya, Tricio and the City of Cantabria) were located, the descendants of Duke Peter withdrew from Rioja towards the Cantabrian area and in time controlled the destiny of the Kingdom of Asturias.

Alfonso began the territorial expansion of the small Christian kingdom from its first seat in the Picos de Europa, advancing toward the west to Galicia and toward the south with continuous incursions in the Douro valley, taking cities and towns and moving their inhabitants to the safer northern zones. It eventually led to the strategic depopulation of the plateau, creating the Desert of the Duero as a protection against future Moorish attacks.

The depopulation, defended by Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz, is doubted today, at least concerning its magnitude. Two main arguments are used to refute it: first, the minor toponymy was preserved in multiple districts; second, there are biological and cultural differences between the inhabitants of the Cantabrian zone and those of the central Plateau. What is true is that in the first half of the eighth century there was a process of rural growth that led to the abandonment of urban life and the organization of the population in small communities of shepherds. Several causes explain this process: the definitive collapse of the Roman Mediterranean economic system from the time of the late Roman Empire due to Arab conquests, the continuous propagation of epidemics in the area, and the abandonment of al-Andalus by the Berber regiments after the revolt of 740–741. All this made possible the emergence of a sparsely populated and ill-organized area that insulated the Asturian kingdom from the Moorish assaults and allowed its progressive strengthening.

The campaigns of kings Alfonso I and Fruela in the Duero valley were probably not very different from the raids that the Astures made in the same area in the pre-Roman era. The initial Asturian expansion was carried out mainly through Cantabrian territory (from Galicia to Vizcaya) and it was not until the reigns of Ordoño I and Alfonso III that the Kingdom of Asturias could take effective possession of the territories located south of the Cantabrian Mountains.

Fruela I, Alfonso I&#x27;s son, consolidated and expanded his father&#x27;s domains. He was assassinated by members of the nobility associated with the House of Cantabria.

== Social and political transformations ==
Written sources are concise concerning the reigns of Aurelio, Silo, Mauregatus and Bermudo I. Generally this period, with a duration of twenty-three years (768–791), has been considered as a long stage of obscurity and retreat of the kingdom of Asturias. This version, defended by some historians, who even named this historical phase as that of the &quot;lazy kings&quot;, derived from the fact that, during it, there were apparently no important military actions against al-Andalus. However, there were relevant and decisive internal transformations, which provided a foundation for the strengthening and the expansion of Asturias.

First, the first internal rebellion, led by Mauregato (783–788), occurred during those years. The rebellion removed Alfonso II from the throne (although he became king again later, from 791 to 842). This initiated a series of further rebellions whose principal leaders were members of ascending aristocratic palace groups and landowners who, based on the growing economic development of the area, tried to unseat the reigning family of Don Pelayo. The important rebellions of Nepociano, Aldroito and Piniolo, during the reign of Ramiro I (842–50), are part of this process of economic, social, political and cultural transformation of the Asturian kingdom that occurred during the eighth and ninth centuries.

Second, neighboring rebellions by Basques and Galicians failed, quashed by Asturian kings. These rebels took advantage of the unrest in the central and Eastern part of Asturias, and, on occasion, provided help to one or another contender for the throne: by providing refuge to Alfonso II in Alava after his flight; the support for Nepociano&#x27;s rebellion in some Asturian areas; and the adherence of Galicians to the cause of Ramiro I.

Finally, other evidence suggests important internal transformations occurred during this time. Rebellions of freedmen (&quot;serbi&quot;, &quot;servilis orico&quot; and &quot;libertini&quot;, according to the &quot;Chronicles&quot;) occurred during the reign of Aurelio I. The property relationship between master and slave broke down progressively. This fact, together with the growing role of the individual and the restricted family, to the detriment of the extended family, is another indication that a new society was emerging in Asturias at the end of the eighth and beginning of the ninth centuries.

Fruela I (757–68) was succeeded by Aurelius (768–74), son of Fruela of Cantabria and Peter of Cantabria&#x27;s grandson, who would establish the court in what is today the district of San Martín del Rey Aurelio, which previously belonged to Langreo. Silo (774–83) succeeded Aurelio after his death, and transferred the court to Pravia. Silo was married to Adosinda, one of the daughters of Alfonso I (and therefore, Pelayo&#x27;s granddaughter).

Alfonso II was elected king after Silo&#x27;s death, but Mauregato organized a strong opposition and forced the new king to withdraw to lands in Alava (his mother, Munia, was Basque), obtaining the Asturian throne. The king, despite the bad reputation attributed by history, had good relations with Beatus of Liébana, perhaps the most important cultural figure of the kingdom, and supported him in his fight against adoptionism. Legend says that Mauregato was Alfonso I&#x27;s bastard son with a Moorish woman, and attributes to him the tribute of a hundred maidens. He was succeeded by Bermudo I, Aurelio&#x27;s brother. He was called &quot;the deacon&quot;, although he probably received only minor vows. Bermudo abdicated after a military defeat, ending his life in a monastery.

== Recognition and later solidification ==
It was not until King Alfonso II (791–842) that the kingdom was firmly established, after Silo&#x27;s subjugated Gallaecia and confirmed territorial gains in western Basque Country. Ties with the Carolingian Franks also got closer and more frequent, with Alfonso II&#x27;s envoys presenting Charlemagne with spoils of war (campaign of Lisbon, 797). Alfonso II introduced himself as &quot;an Emperor Charlemagne&#x27;s man&quot;, suggesting some kind of suzerainty. During Alfonso II&#x27;s reign, a probable reaction against indigenous traditions took place in order to strengthen his state and grip on power, by establishing in the Asturian Court the order and ceremonies of the former Visigoth Kingdom. Around this time, the holy bones of James, son of Zebedee were declared to have been found in Galicia at Iria Flavia. They were considered authentic by a contemporary pope of Rome. However, during the Asturian period, the final resting place of Eulalia of Mérida, located in Oviedo, became the primary religious site and focus of devotion.

Alfonso II also repopulated parts of Galicia, León and Castile and incorporated them into the Kingdom of Asturias while establishing influence over parts of the Basques. The first capital city was Cangas de Onís, near the site of the battle of Cavadonga. Then in Silo&#x27;s time, it was moved to Pravia. Alfonso II chose his birthplace of Oviedo as the capital of the kingdom (circa 789).
Ramiro I began his reign by capturing several other claimants to the throne, blinding them, and then confining them to monasteries. As a warrior he managed to defeat a Viking invasion after the Vikings had landed at Corunna, and also fought several battles against the Moors.
When he succeeded his father Ramiro, Ordoño I (850–66) repressed a major revolt amongst the Basques in the east of the kingdom. In 859, Ordoño besieged the fortress of Albelda, built by Musa ibn Musa of the Banu Qasi, who had rebelled against Cordoba and became master of Zaragoza, Tudela, Huesca and Toledo. Musa attempted to lift the siege in alliance with his brother-in-law García Iñiguez, the king of Pamplona, whose small realm was threatened by the eastwards expansion of the Asturian monarchy. In the battle that followed, Musa was defeated and lost valuable treasures in the process, some of which were sent as a gift to Charles the Bald of Francia. Seven days after the victory, Albelda fell and, as the chronicler records, &quot;its warriors were killed by the sword and the place itself was destroyed down to its foundations.&quot; Musa was wounded in the battle and died in 862/3; soon thereafter, Musa&#x27;s son Lubb, governor of Toledo, submitted himself to the Asturian king for the rest of Ordoño&#x27;s reign.

When Alfonso III&#x27;s sons forced his abdication in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms: León, Galicia and Asturias. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 (León and Galicia in 914, Asturias later) under the crown of León. It continued under that name until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230, after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms.

== Viking raids ==
The Vikings invaded Galicia in 844, but were decisively defeated by Ramiro I at Corunna. Many of the Vikings&#x27; casualties were caused by the Galicians&#x27; ballistas – powerful torsion-powered projectile weapons that looked rather like giant crossbows. Seventy of the Vikings&#x27; longships were captured on the beach and burned. A few months later, another fleet took Seville. The Vikings found in Seville a population which was still largely Gothic and Romano-Spanish. The Gothic elements were important in the Andalusian emirate. Musa ibn Musa, who took a leading part in the defeat of the Vikings at Tablada, belonged to a powerful Muwallad family of Gothic descent.

Vikings returned to Galicia in 859, during the reign of Ordoño I. Ordoño was at the moment engaged against his constant enemies, the Moors, but a count of the province, Don Pedro, attacked the Vikings and defeated them, inflicting severe losses upon them. Ordoño&#x27;s successor, Alfonso III, strove to protect the coast against attacks from Vikings or Moors. In 968, Gunrod of Norway attacked Galicia with 100 ships and 8,000 warriors. They roamed freely for years and even occupied Santiago de Compostela. A Galician count of Visigothic descent, Gonzalo Sánchez, ended the Viking adventure in 971, when he launched an attack with a powerful army that defeated the Vikings in a bloody battle, and captured Gunrod, who was subsequently executed along with his followers.

== Religion ==

=== Remnants of Megalithic and Celtic paganism ===
Although the earliest evidence of Christian worship in Asturias dates from the 5th century, evangelisation did not make any substantial progress until the middle of the sixth century, when hermits like Turibius of Liébana and monks of the Saint Fructuoso order gradually settled in the Cantabrian mountains and began preaching the Christian doctrine.

Christianisation progressed slowly in Asturias and did not necessarily supplant the ancient pagan divinities. As elsewhere in Europe, the new religion coexisted syncretically with features of the ancient beliefs. In the sixth century, bishop San Martín de Braga complained in his work &quot;De correctione rusticorum&quot; about the Galician peasants being attached to the pre-Christian cults: &quot;Many demons, who were expelled from the heavens, settled in the sea, in the rivers, fountains and forests, and have come to be worshipped as gods by ignorant people. To them they do their sacrifices: in the sea they invoke Neptune, in the rivers the Lamias; in the fountains the Nymphs, and in the forests Diana.&quot;
In the middle of the Sella valley, where Cangas de Onís is located, there was a dolmen area dating back to the megalithic era, and was likely built between 4000 and 2000 BC. Chieftains from the surrounding regions were ritually buried here, particularly in the Santa Cruz dolmen. Such practices survived the Roman and Visigothic conquests. Even in the eighth century, King Favila was buried there, along with the bodies of tribal leaders. Although the Asturian monarchy fostered the Christianisation of this site, by constructing a church, to this day there are still pagan traditions linked with the Santa Cruz dolmen. It is said that &quot;xanas&quot; (Asturian fairies) appear to visitors, and magical properties are ascribed to the soil of the place.

According to an inscription found in the Santa Cruz church, it was consecrated in 738 and was presided by a &quot;vates&quot; called Asterio. The word &quot;vates&quot; is uncommon in Catholic documents and epitaphs, where the word &quot;presbyterus&quot; (for Christian priests) is preferred. However, &quot;vates&quot; was used in Latin to denote a poet who was clairvoyant, and according to the Ancient Greek writers Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Posidonius, the &quot;vates&quot; (ουατεις) were also one of three classes of Celtic priesthood, the other two being the druids and the bards. Some historians think that Asterio held a religious office which combined elements of paganism and Christianity, while others think he may be linked to the Brythonic refugees that settled in Britonia (Galicia) in the 6th century. The &quot;Parrochiale Suevorum,&quot; an administrative document from the Kingdom of the Suebi, states that the lands of Asturias belonged to the Britonian See, and some features of Celtic Christianity spread to Northern Spain. This is evidenced by the Celtic tonsure, which the Visigothic bishops who participated in the Fourth Council of Toledo condemned.

Still extant Galician legends relate to monks who travelled by sea to the Paradise Islands, like those of Saint Amaro, Trezenzonio or &quot;The Legend of Ero of Armenteira&quot;. These stories have many parallels with those of Brendan the navigator, Malo of Wales, and the stories of the Irish immrama.

Asturian kings promoted Christianity and but also based their power on indigenous religious traditions, like other medieval European kings such as Penda of Mercia or Widukind, but also relied on Christian sacred scriptures (in particular, the books of Revelation, Ezekiel and Daniel) and the Church Fathers. These furnished the new monarchy with its foundational myths. They did not need to draft new laws since the Visigothic Code was the referential code, at least since the arrival of new influences including exiles, prisoners from the central area of al-Andalus in the 770s along with their mixed Berber-Arabic and Gothic legacy. This combined with governmental and religious ideas imported from Charlemagne&#x27;s Frankish Kingdom (Alcuin-Beatus of Liébana).

=== Adoptionism ===

The foundations of Asturian culture and that of Christian Spain in the High Middle Ages were laid during the reigns of Silo and Mauregatus, when the Asturian kings submitted to the authority of the Umayyad emirs of the Caliphate of Córdoba. The most prominent Christian scholar in the Kingdom of Asturias of this period was Beatus of Liébana, whose works left an indelible mark on the Christian culture of the Reconquista.

Beatus was directly involved in the debate surrounding adoptionism, which argued that Jesus was born a man, and was adopted by God and acquired a divine dimension only after his passion and resurrection. Beatus refuted this theological position, championed by such figures as Elipando, bishop of Toledo.

The adoptionist theology had its roots in Gothic Arianism, which denied the divinity of Jesus, and in Hellenistic religion, with examples of heroes like Heracles who, after their death attained the apotheosis. Likewise, as Elipandus&#x27;s bishopric of Toledo was at the time within the Muslim Caliphate of Cordoba, Islamic beliefs which acknowledged Jesus as a Prophet, but not as the Son of God, influenced the formation of adoptionism. However, the adoptionist theology was opposed strongly by Beatus from his abbey in Santo Toribio de Liébana. At the same time, Beatus strengthened the links among Asturias, the Holy See, and the Carolingian Empire, and was supported in his theological struggle by the Pope and by his friend Alcuin of York, an Anglo-Saxon scholar who had settled among the Carolingian court in Aachen.

=== Millennialism ===

The most transcendental works of Beatus were his &quot;Commentaries to Apocalypse&quot;, which were copied in later centuries in manuscripts called &quot;beati&quot;, about which the Italian writer Umberto Eco said: &quot;Their splendid images gave birth to the most relevant iconographic happening in the History of Mankind&quot;. Beatus develops in them a personal interpretation of the Book of Revelation, accompanied by quotes from the Old Testament, the Church Fathers and fascinating illustrations.

In these &quot;Commentaries&quot; a new interpretation of the apocalyptic accounts is given: Babylon no longer represents the city of Rome, but Córdoba, seat of the Umayyad emirs of al-Andalus; the Beast, once a symbol of the Roman Empire, now stands for the Islamic invaders who during this time threatened to destroy Western Christianity, and who raided territories of the Asturian Kingdom.

The prologue to the second book of the &quot;Commentaries&quot; contains the Beatus map, one of the best examples of a &quot;mappa mundi&quot; of the high medieval culture. The purpose of this map was not to represent the world cartographically, but to illustrate the Apostles&#x27; diaspora in the first decades of Christianity. Beatus took data from the works of Isidore of Seville, Ptolemy and the Bible. The world was represented as a land disc surrounded by the Ocean and divided in three parts: Asia (upper semicircle), Europe (lower left quadrant) and Africa (lower right quadrant). The Mediterranean Sea (Europe-Africa), the Nile River (Africa-Asia), the Aegean Sea, and the Bosphorus (Europe-Asia) were set as the boundaries between the different continents.

Beatus believed that the Apocalypse described in the book of Revelation was imminent, which would be followed by 1290 years of domination by the Antichrist. Beatus followed the views of Augustine of Hippo, whose work, &quot;The City of God&quot;, influenced the &quot;Commentaries&quot; which followed the premise that the history of the world was structured in six ages. The first five ones extended from the creation of Adam to the Passion of Jesus, while the sixth, subsequent to Christ, ends with the unleashing of the events prophesied in the book of Revelation.

Millennialist movements were very common in Europe at that time. Between 760 and 780, a series of cosmic phenomena stirred up panic among the population of Gaul; John, a visionary monk, predicted the coming of the Last Judgment during the reign of Charlemagne. In this time the Apocalypse of Daniel appeared, a Syriac text redacted during the rule of the empress Irene of Athens, wherein wars between the Arabs, the Byzantines and the Northern peoples were prophesied. These wars would end with the coming of the Antichrist.

Events taking place in Hispania (Islamic rule, the adoptionist heresy, the gradual assimilation of the Mozarabs) were, for Beatus, signals of the imminent apocalypse. aeon. As Elipandus describes in his &quot;Letter from the bishops of Spania to their brothers in Gaul&quot;, the abbot of Santo Toribio went so far as to announce to his countrymen the coming of the End of Time on Easter of the year 800. On the dawn of that day, hundreds of peasants met around the abbey of Santo Toribio, waiting, terrified, for the fulfillment of the prophecy. They remained in there, without eating for a day and half, until one of them, named Ordonius, exclaimed: &quot;Let us eat and drink, so that if the End of the World comes we are full!&quot;.

The prophetic and millennialist visions of Beatus produced an enduring mark in the development of the Kingdom of Asturias: the &quot;Chronica Prophetica&quot;, which was written around 880 CE, predicted the final fall of the Emirate of Córdoba, and the conquest and redemption of the entire Iberian Peninsula by king Alfonso III. Millennialist imagery is also reflected throughout the kingdom in the Victory Cross icon, the major emblem of the Asturian kingdom, which has its origins in a passage of the Revelation book in which John of Patmos relates a vision of the Second Coming. He sees Jesus Christ seated in his majesty, surrounded by clouds and affirming: &quot;I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty&quot;. It is true that usage of the labarum was not restricted to Asturias, and dates back to the time of Constantine the Great, who used this symbol during the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. However, it was in Asturias where the Cruz de la Victoria attained a general use: in nearly every pre-Romanesque church this icon is engraved, often accompanied with the expression &quot;Hoc signo tuetur pius, in hoc signo vincitur inimicus&quot;, that became the royal motto of the Asturian monarchs.

=== Camino de Santiago ===
Another of the major spiritual legacies of the Asturian kingdom is the creation of one of the most important ways of cultural transmission in European history: the Camino de Santiago. The first text which mentions St. James&#x27; preaching in Spain is the &quot;Breviarius de Hyerosolima&quot;, a 6th-century document which stated that the Apostle was buried in an enigmatic place called &quot;&quot;. Isidore of Seville supported this theory in his work &quot;De ortu et obitu patrium&quot;. One hundred and fifty years later, in the times of Mauregato, the hymn &quot;O Dei Verbum&quot; rendered St. James as &quot;the golden head of Spain, our protector and national patron&quot; and a mention is made of his preaching in the Iberian Peninsula during the first decades of Christianity. Some attribute this hymn to Beatus, although this is still discussed by historians.

The legend of St. James gained support during the reign of Alfonso II. The period was marked by Alfonso II&#x27;s reaching out to Charlemagne for military assistance and importation of similar royal ceremonies and governmental structures. Galician Pelagius the Hermit claimed to observe a mysterious brightness during several nights over the forest, in Iria Flavia diocese. Angelic songs accompanied the lights. Impressed by this phenomenon, Pelayo appeared before the bishop of Iria Flavia, Theodemir, who – after having heard the hermit – visited the location with his retinue. Legend has it that in the depths of the forest was found a stone sepulchre with three corpses, which were identified as those of St. James, son of Zebedee, and his two disciples, Theodorus and Atanasius. According to the legend, King Alfonso was the first pilgrim who had come to see the Apostle. During his travels he was guided at night by the Milky Way, which from then on acquired the name of &quot;Camino de Santiago&quot;.

The founding of the alleged St. James tomb was a formidable political success for the Kingdom of Asturias: Now Asturias could claim the honour of having the body of one of the apostles of Jesus, a privilege shared only with Asia (Ephesus) where John the Apostle was buried, and Rome, where the bodies of Saint Peter and Saint Paul rested. As of the early 12th century, Santiago de Compostela grew to become one of the three sacred cities of Christianity, together with Rome and Jerusalem. In later centuries, many Central European cultural influences travelled to Iberia through the Way of St. James, from the Gothic and Romanesque styles, to the Occitan lyric poetry.

However, the story of the &quot;discovery&quot; of the remains of the Apostle shows some enigmatic features. The tomb was found in a place used as a necropolis since the Late Roman Empire, so it is possible that the body belonged to a prominent person of the area. British historian Henry Chadwick hypothesized the tomb of Compostela actually hold the remains of Priscillian. Historian Roger Collins holds that the identification of the relics (at any rate nothing close to a full body) with Saint James is related to the translation of the remains found under a 6th-century church altar in Mérida, where various saint names are listed, Saint James among them. Other scholars, like Constantino Cabal, highlighted the fact that several Galician places, such as Pico Sacro, Pedra da Barca (Muxía) or San Andrés de Teixido, were already draws for pagan pilgrimage in pre-Roman times. Pagan beliefs held these places as the End of the World and as entrances to the Celtic Otherworld. After the discovery of Saint James&#x27; tomb, the gradual Christianization of those pilgrimage routes began.

=== Mythology ===
Since the Chronicles of the Asturian kingdom were written a century and a half after the battle of Covadonga, there are many aspects of the first Asturian kings that remain shrouded in myth and legend.

Although the historicity of Pelayo is beyond doubt, the historical narrative describing him includes many folktales and legends. One of them asserts that, prior to the Muslim invasion, Pelayo went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the sacred city of Christianity. However, there is no extant evidence of this.

Likewise, it is also said that the &quot;Cruz de la Victoria&quot; was at first carved in an oak&#x27;s log by a lightning strike. The core of this story contains two elements of major importance in the Asturian folklore. On one hand, lightning was the ancient symbol of the Astur god Taranis, and in Asturian mythology was thought to be forged by the Nuberu, lord of clouds, rain and wind. On the other hand, the oak tree is the symbol of the Asturian royalty and in reliefs of the Abamia Church (where Pelayo was buried) leaves of that tree are shown.

The Covadonga area is also rich with astonishing stories, such as the one which is said to have happened in a shepherd village where today Lakes Enol and Ercina are situated. Mary, mother of Jesus, disguised as a pilgrim, is said to have visited that village and asked for food and shelter from every house. She was rudely rejected by every person, except for a shepherd who gave her refuge and warmly shared everything he had. On the following day, as punishment for their lack of hospitality, a flood of divine origin devastated the village, which completely covered everything except the cottage of the good shepherd. In front of him, the mysterious guest started to cry, and her tears became flowers when they reached the floor. Then the shepherd realized that the pilgrim was actually Mary.

There are also myths about the Asturian monarchy that are rooted in Jewish and Christian traditions rather than pagan ones: the &quot;Chronica ad Sebastianum&quot; tells of an extraordinary event that happened when Alfonso I died. While the noblemen were holding a wake for him, there could be heard celestial canticles sung by angels. They recited the following text of the Book of Isaiah (which happens to be the same that was read by the Mozarabic priests during the Vigil of the Holy Saturday):

This canticle was recited by Hezekiah, king of Judah, after his recovery from a serious illness. In these verses, the king regretted with distress his departure to sheol, the Jewish underworld, a shady place where he would not see God nor men any more.

Asturias also has examples of the king in the mountain myth. According to the tradition, it is still today possible to see king Fruela walking around the &quot;Jardín de los Reyes Caudillos&quot; (a part of the Oviedo Cathedral), and it is said that his grandson, the famous cavalier Bernardo del Carpio, sleeps in a cave in the Asturian mountains. The story tells that one day a peasant went into a certain cave to retrieve his lost cow and heard a strong voice who declared to be Bernardo del Carpio, victor over the Franks in Roncevaux. After saying he had lived alone for centuries in that cave, he told the peasant: &quot;Give me your hand, so that I can see how strong are men today&quot;. The shepherd, scared, gave him the horn of the cow, which, when seized by the giant man, was immediately broken. The poor villager ran away terrified, but not without hearing Bernardo say: &quot;Current men are not like those who helped me to kill Frenchmen in Roncevaux&quot;.

== Legacy ==
This kingdom is the birthplace of an influential European medieval architectural style: Asturian pre-Romanesque. This style of architecture was founded during the reign of Ramiro I.

This small kingdom was a milestone in the fight against the adoptionist heresy, with Beatus of Liébana as a major figure. In the time of Alfonso II, the shrine of Santiago de Compostela was &quot;found&quot;. The pilgrimage to Santiago, Camiño de Santiago, was a major nexus within Europe, and many pilgrims (and their money) passed through Asturias on their way to Santiago de Compostela.

<text>The Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady&#x27;s Illustrated Primer is a science fiction novel by American writer Neal Stephenson. It is to some extent a Bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, focused on a young girl named Nell, set in a future world in which nanotechnology affects all aspects of life. The novel deals with themes of education, social class, ethnicity, and the nature of artificial intelligence. &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; was first published in 1995 by Bantam Books, as a Bantam Spectra hardcover edition. In 1996, it won both the Hugo and Locus Awards, and was shortlisted for the Nebula and other awards.

==Setting==
&quot;The Diamond Age&quot; depicts a near-future world revolutionised by advances in nanotechnology, much as Eric Drexler envisioned it in his 1986 nonfiction book &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;. Molecular nanotechnology is omnipresent in the novel&#x27;s world, generally in the form of Matter Compilers and the products that come out of them. The book explicitly recognizes the achievements of several existing nanotechnology researchers: Feynman, Drexler, and Ralph Merkle are seen among characters of the fresco in Merkle-Hall, where new nanotechnological items are designed and constructed.

The book contains descriptions of various exotic technologies, such as the &quot;chevaline&quot; (a mechanical horse that can fold up and is light enough to be carried one-handed), and forecasts the use of technologies that are in development today, such as smart paper that can show personalized news headlines. Major cities have immune systems made up of aerostatic defensive micromachines, and public matter compilers provide basic food, blankets, and water for free to anyone who requests them.

Matter compilers receive their raw materials from the Feed, a system analogous to the electrical grid of modern society. The Feed carries streams of both energy and basic molecules, which are rapidly assembled into usable goods by matter compilers. The Source, where the Feed&#x27;s stream of matter originates, is controlled by the Victorian phyle (though smaller, independent Feeds are possible). The hierarchic nature of the Feed and an alternative, anarchic developing technology, known as the Seed, mirror the cultural conflict between East and West that is depicted in the book. This conflict has an economic element as well, with the Feed representing a centrally-controlled distribution mechanism, while the Seed represents a more flexible, open-ended, decentralized method of creation and organization.

===Phyles===
Society in &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; is dominated by a number of &quot;phyles&quot;, also sometimes called &quot;tribes&quot;, which are groups of people often distinguished by shared values, similar ethnic heritage, a common religion, or other cultural similarities. In the extremely globalized future depicted in the novel, these cultural divisions have largely supplanted the system of nation-states that divides the world today. Cities appear divided into sovereign enclaves affiliated or belonging to different phyles within a single metropolis. Most phyles depicted in the novel have a global scope of sovereignty, and maintain segregated enclaves in or near many cities throughout the world.

The phyles coexist much like historical nation-states under a system of justice and mutual protection, known as the Common Economic Protocol (CEP). The rules of the CEP are intended to provide for the co-existence of, and peaceful economic activity between, phyles with potentially very different values. The CEP is concerned particularly with upholding rights to personal property, being shown to provide particularly harsh punishment for harming the economic capability of another person.

&quot;Thetes&quot; are individuals who are not members of any phyle and are often socially disadvantaged and economically poor, being similar to second-class citizens under the CEP. In the novel, the material needs of nearly all thetes are satisfied by freely available food and clothing, albeit of low quality; thetes without the political connections of a phyle are entitled to similarly low-quality &quot;free justice.&quot;

The book distinguishes between the four Great Phyles: the Han (consisting of Han Chinese), Nippon (consisting of Japanese), Hindustan (a &quot;riotously diverse collection of microtribes sintered together according to some formula we don&#x27;t get&quot;) and the Neo-Victorian New Atlantis (consisting largely of Anglo-Saxons but also accepting Indians, Africans, and other members of the Anglosphere who identify with the culture).

Internally, the New Atlantis phyle is a corporate oligarchy whose &quot;equity lords&quot; rule the organization and its bylaws under allegiance to the vestigial British monarchy. Other phyles are less defined – some intentionally, as with the CryptNet group or the mysterious hive-mind Drummers. Over the course of the story, the Common Economic Protocol sponsors the investigation of clandestine Seed technologies in order to preserve the established order from subversion, using the justification that unrestricted access to Sources would lead to the proliferation of high tech weapons and result in anarchy.

==Plot summary==

The protagonist in the story is Nell, a &quot;thete&quot; (or person without a tribe; equivalent to the lowest working class) living in the Leased Territories, a lowland slum built on the artificial, diamondoid island of New Chusan, located offshore from the mouth of the Yangtze River, northwest of Shanghai. When she is four, Nell&#x27;s older brother Harv gives her a stolen copy of a highly sophisticated interactive book, &quot;Young Lady&#x27;s Illustrated : a &quot;, in which is told the tale of Princess Nell and her various friends, kin, associates, etc., commissioned by the wealthy Neo-Victorian &quot;Equity Lord&quot; Alexander Chung-Sik Finkle-McGraw for his granddaughter, Elizabeth. The story follows Nell&#x27;s development under the tutelage of the Primer, and to a lesser degree, the lives of Elizabeth Finkle-McGraw and Fiona Hackworth, Neo-Victorian girls who receive other copies. The Primer is intended to steer its reader intellectually toward a more &quot;interesting life,&quot; as defined by Lord Finkle-McGraw, and growing up to be an effective member of society. The most important quality to achieving an interesting life is deemed to be a subversive attitude towards the status quo. The Primer is designed to react to its owner&#x27;s environment and teach them what they need to know to survive and develop.

&quot;The Diamond Age&quot; features intersecting story lines: the social downfall of the nanotech engineer designer of the Primer, John Percival Hackworth, who makes an unauthorized copy of the Primer for his own young daughter, Fiona, and Nell&#x27;s education through her independent work with the Primer after her brother Harv steals it from Hackworth. Hackworth&#x27;s crime becomes known to Dr. X, the black market engineer whose compiler Hackworth used to create the copy of the Primer, and later Lord Finkle-McGraw. Hackworth is compelled by both to advance their opposing goals. Another storyline follows actress (&quot;ractor&quot;) Miranda Redpath, who voices most of the Primer characters who interact with Nell and effectively becomes a surrogate mother to Nell. After Miranda disappears in her quest to find Nell, her storyline continues from the point of view of her boss, Carl Hollywood. 

&quot;The Diamond Age&quot; also includes fully narrated educational tales from the Primer that map Nell&#x27;s individual experience (e.g. her four toy friends) onto archetypal folk tales stored in the primer&#x27;s database. The story explores the role of technology and personal relationships in child development, and its deeper themes also probe the relative values of cultures.

==Title==
&quot;Diamond Age&quot; is an extension of labels for archeological time periods that take central technological materials to define an entire era of human history, such as the Stone Age, the Bronze Age or the Iron Age. Technological visionaries such as Eric Drexler and Ralph Merkle, both of whom receive an honorary mention in &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;, have argued that if nanotechnology develops the ability to manipulate individual atoms at will, it will become possible to simply assemble diamond structures from carbon atoms, materials also known as diamondoids. Merkle states: &quot;In diamond, then, a dense network of strong bonds creates a strong, light, and stiff material. Indeed, just as we named the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Steel Age after the materials that humans could make, we might call the new technological epoch we are entering the Diamond Age&quot;. In the novel, a near future vision of our world, nanotechnology has developed precisely to this point, which enables the cheap production of diamond structures.

==Characters==

* Nell – The story&#x27;s protagonist, from the viewpoint of the novel as a coming-of-age story. She is born to Tequila, a lower-class single mother, and, with the help of the nanotech Primer, grows up to become an independent woman and the leader of a new phyle.
* Harv – Nell&#x27;s older brother, who plays an important role in the beginning as her protector; he obtains the Primer for his sister by mugging John Percival Hackworth. Harv is forced to leave Nell when she is accepted by the Neo-Victorians, and is later bedridden by asthma caused by the inhalation of dead nanomachines (&quot;toner&quot;) in his childhood.
* Bud – A petty criminal and &quot;thete&quot;, or tribeless individual, Bud is Tequila&#x27;s boyfriend and Nell and Harv&#x27;s father. He is obsessed with his muscular body, and possesses a cranial weapon implant (known as a &quot;skull gun&quot;), which he uses to mug people. When he robs a couple who are members of the powerful Ashanti phyle, he is executed for this crime early in the novel.
* Tequila – Nell and Harv&#x27;s neglectful thete mother. After Bud&#x27;s death, she has a series of boyfriends who mistreat the children to varying degrees.
* John Percival Hackworth – The novel&#x27;s second protagonist. He is a Neo-Victorian nanotech engineer, and develops the code for the Primer. He makes an illicit copy of the Primer for his daughter Fiona, who is Nell&#x27;s age. When his crime is detected, he is forced to become a double agent in a covert power struggle between the Neo-Victorians and the Chinese Celestial Kingdom. Hackworth is forced to spend ten years with a colony of &quot;Drummers,&quot; subsuming his personality into their gestalt intelligence (similar but not identical to distributed artificial intelligence) for the development of the Seed, an indigenous nanotechnology that aims to end Chinese dependence on the Victorian-controlled Feed.
* Fiona Hackworth – Hackworth&#x27;s daughter, and his motivation for stealing a second copy of the Primer. During Hackworth&#x27;s decade-long altered consciousness with the Drummers, he is able to maintain a connection with his daughter through the Primer, and when he returns she joins him, eventually choosing to stay with a surrealistic acting troupe in London.
* Gwendolyn Hackworth – Hackworth&#x27;s wife and Fiona&#x27;s mother, who divorces Hackworth during his long absence.
* Lord Alexander Chung-Sik Finkle-McGraw – A Neo-Victorian &quot;Equity Lord&quot; with the Apthorp conglomerate, who commissions the development of the Primer for his granddaughter Elizabeth.
* Elizabeth Finkle-McGraw – Lord Finkle-McGraw&#x27;s granddaughter. It was for her that the project to develop the Illustrated Primer was begun. However, she never became as engrossed in the stories created by the Primer as Nell, and later rebelled against her Neo-Victorian upbringing due in part to the abuse by Miss Stricken, one of her teachers. Elizabeth runs away from her wealthy aristocratic family to join the secretive CryptNet phyle. Lord Finkle-McGraw expresses satisfaction with this outcome to Carl Hollywood, deeming it akin to youthful rebellion.
* Judge Fang – A New York-born Chinese Confucian judge who sentences Bud to death in the beginning of the book. He also investigates Hackworth&#x27;s mugging by Harv and his gang. As a civil official with deep Confucian principles, his decision to let Nell keep the stolen primer is one of the pivotal plot elements that allows Nell&#x27;s story to unfold. The fallout from that choice leads him to question his allegiances to the Coastal Republic (which rules Shanghai and the surrounding area), and he eventually joins the inland Celestial Kingdom.
* Lieutenant Chang and Miss Pao – Judge Fang&#x27;s assistants.
* Dr. X. – A mysterious character who evolves from being an illicit technology specialist and hacker to being a powerful Confucian leader and nefarious force. His name comes from the fact that most westerners cannot pronounce his Chinese name; he encourages people to instead call him by the first letter of his name.
* Constable Moore - Constable of the Dovetail community, semi-retired soldier, and Nell&#x27;s adoptive father/guardian.
* Miranda Redpath – A &quot;ractor&quot; (actor in interactive movies) who, by performing in the stories of Nell&#x27;s Primer, effectively becomes a mother figure for Nell.
* Carl Hollywood – A theatrical company director and Miranda&#x27;s boss and adviser. He becomes more important towards the end of the novel, helping Miranda on her quest to find Nell, and aiding the escape of Coastal Republic refugees from the encroaching anti-Western Fists of the Celestial Kingdom. Nell appoints him as a trusted advisor of her new phyle.
* Miss Matheson – The head teacher at the academy where Nell, Fiona, and Elizabeth attend. She instructs Nell to find her own path.
* Miss Stricken – An authoritarian teacher at Miss Matheson&#x27;s Academy who frequently uses corporal punishment on the students for minor infractions. During a confrontation with Nell, Stricken attempts to strike her with the ruler only to be immediately disarmed due to Nell&#x27;s physical training by the Primer. This leads to her, Elizabeth and Fiona all being placed in detention, where they are forced to mindlessly copy from textbooks.

==Reception==
===Reviews===

Michael Berry of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: &quot;Stephenson&#x27;s world-building skills are extraordinary, and while he sometimes lets his narrative ramble or grow complicated, he can be depended upon to serve up plenty of clever extrapolations.&quot;
Gerald Jonas of &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;While the final chapters of the novel veer toward the stylistic excesses that marred &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, Mr. Stephenson mostly holds to his theme.&quot;
Marc Laidlaw of &quot;Wired&quot; praised the characters, the setting, and called the &quot;rich and polished, the inventiveness unceasing&quot; but found it ultimately disappointing saying Stephenson &quot;gave himself an enormous task and nearly succeeded in all respects, instead of &quot;merely&quot; most of them.&quot;

===Awards===
In 1996, it won both the Hugo and Locus Awards, and was shortlisted for the Nebula and other awards.

==Allusions to other works and genres==
* Charles Dickens. The novel&#x27;s neo-Victorian setting, as well as its narrative form, particularly the chapter headings, suggest a relation to the work of Charles Dickens. The protagonist&#x27;s name points directly to Little Nell from Dickens&#x27; 1840 novel &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;.
* Judge Dee mysteries. The novel&#x27;s character Judge Fang is based on a creative extension of Robert van Gulik&#x27;s Judge Dee mystery series, which is based around a Confucian judge in ancient China who usually solves three cases simultaneously. The Judge Dee stories are based on the tradition of Chinese mysteries, transposing key elements into Western detective fiction.
* &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. When Nell enters the castle of King Coyote in the Primer&#x27;s final challenge for her, she encounters an enormous computer apparently designed to think and placed in charge of the kingdom. The computer is named &quot;Wizard 0.2&quot;, a typographical allusion to &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. In that book, the Wizard puts on a grand appearance but is later revealed to be merely a man hiding behind a curtain. In similar fashion, Wizard 0.2 creates an impressive light show as it apparently processes data, but it is revealed that the computer&#x27;s decisions are in fact made by King Coyote himself.

==Proposed television adaptation==
In January 2007, the Sci-Fi Channel announced a planned six-hour miniseries based on &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;. 
According to a June 2009 report in &quot;Variety&quot;, Zoë Green had been hired to write the series, with George Clooney and Grant Heslov of Smokehouse Productions as executive producers on the project.

==Allusions to &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;==
During the early stages of its development, the Amazon Kindle e-reader was codenamed &quot;Fiona&quot;, as a deliberate reference to the Illustrated Primer and Fiona Hackworth.

<doc id="52225" wikidata="Q7832040" url="?curid=52225" title="Trade dress">
<text>Trade dress is the characteristics of the visual appearance of a product or its packaging (or even the design of a building) that signify the source of the product to consumers. Trade dress is an aspect of trademark law, which is a form of intellectual property protection law. 

==Overview==
Trade dress is an extension of trademark protection to &quot;[t]he design and shape of the materials in which a product is packaged, [primarily]. &#x27;Product configuration,&#x27; the design and shape of the product itself, may also be considered a form of trade dress.&quot; 

Product configuration applies particularly to situations where the product can be seen within the packaging (e.g. a toy car sold in packaging that operates as a shadow box for commercial display within—the collective look it creates is trade dress), or where the packaging is part of the product (e.g. the bottle of a soft drink, along with its visible contents, are trade dress, though the bottle is actually part of the product that retains its value to the consumer for as long as its contents last).

Like all intellectual property law other than patent law, trade dress and other trademark elements are subject to the bar on functional features (e.g. a handle cannot be protected, though it may contain trade dress features that can prevent exact replicas of a particular trade dress handle). It is a question of which elements of the packaging are intrinsic to the basic function of the packaging.

In the United States, the Lanham Act protects trade dress if it serves the same source-identifying function as a trademark. It is possible to register trade dress as a trademark, but for practical reasons most trade dress and product configurations are protected without registration under .

==By country==
=== United Kingdom ===

Trade dress can be protected as getup under the law of passing off in the UK. Passing off is a common law remedy for protecting an unregistered trade mark. Getup, packaging, business strategy, marketing techniques, advertisement themes etc. can also be protected under passing off.

===United States===
Trade dress protection is intended to protect consumers from packaging or appearance of products that are designed to imitate other products; to prevent a consumer from buying one product under the belief that it is another. For example, the shape, color, and arrangement of the materials of a children&#x27;s line of clothing can be protectable trade dress (though, the design of the garments themselves is not protected), as can the design of a magazine cover, the appearance and décor of a chain of Mexican-style restaurants, and a method of displaying wine bottles in a wine shop.

====Statutory source====
Trademark law is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of the United States (as opposed to patent and copyright protection law); as such, trademark law—and thus, trade dress—is enforced on the state level in addition to the federal level.

In the U.S., like trademarks, a product&#x27;s trade dress is legally protected by the Lanham Act, the federal statute which regulates trademarks and trade dress. Under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, a product&#x27;s trade dress can be protected without formal registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In part, section 43(a) states the following:

Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by such an act.

This statute allows the owner of a particular trade dress (&quot;container for goods&quot;) to sue an infringer (a person or entity who illegally copies that trade dress) for violating section 43(a) without registering that trade dress with any formal agency or system (unlike the registration and application requirements for enforcing other forms of intellectual property, such as patents). It is commonly seen as providing &quot;federal common law&quot; protection for trade dress (and trademarks).

====Formal registration====

Trade dress may be registered with the PTO in either the Principal Register or the Supplemental Register. Although registration is not required for legal protection, registration offers several advantages. In the Principal Register, a registrant gains nationwide constructive use and constructive notice, which prevent others from using or registering that registrant&#x27;s trade dress (without contesting the registration). Further, a registrant in the Principal Register gains incontestable status after five years, which eliminates many of the ways for another party to challenge the registration. Registration under the Supplemental Register allows the registrant to protect its trade dress in foreign countries, although the protections are much more limited than protections under the Principal Register in the U.S.

====Legal requirements====

It can be difficult to obtain protection for trade dress, as applicants must prove that the design has secondary meaning to consumers and is then further limited by the functionality doctrine.

=====Functionality=====

To gain registration in the Principal Register or common law protection under the Lanham Act, a trade dress must not be &quot;functional&quot;. That is, the configuration of shapes, designs, colors, or materials that make up the trade dress in question must not serve a utility or function outside of creating recognition in the consumer&#x27;s mind. For example, even though consumers associated a distinct spring design for wind resistant road signs with a particular company, the spring design was not protectable for trade dress purposes because the springs served the function of withstanding heavy wind conditions.

What is considered &quot;functional&quot; depends upon the specific product or thing sought to be protected. For example, the color red in a line of clothing may not be functional (and thus part of protectable trade dress) whereas the same color on a stop sign would be functional because the color red serves the function of putting drivers on alert (and thus would not be part of a protectable trade dress).

=====Distinctiveness=====
To gain registration in the Principal Register or common law protection under the Lanham Act, a trade dress must be &quot;distinctive.&quot; This means that consumers perceive a particular trade dress as identifying a source of a product.

Claimed trade dress in the product design—as opposed to product packaging—context can no longer be &quot;inherently distinctive&quot;; it must acquire distinctiveness through &quot;secondary meaning&quot;. Distinctiveness through secondary meaning means that although a trade dress is not distinctive on its face, the use of the trade dress in the market (the &quot;goodwill&quot; of the trade dress) has created an association between that trade dress and a source in the mind of the consumer.

Although the law is evolving, as it stands now, product packaging (including packaging in very general terms, such as a building&#x27;s décor) may be inherently distinctive. However, product design, that is the design or shape of the product itself, may not be inherently distinctive, and must acquire secondary meaning.

====Protection for electronic interfaces and websites====
Although the exact boundaries of protection are still uncertain, courts are beginning to allow trade dress protection for the overall &quot;look and feel&quot; of a website. In &quot;Blue Nile, Inc. v. Ice.com, Inc.&quot;, the plaintiff sued the defendant in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington for copying the overall &quot;look and feel&quot; of plaintiff&#x27;s retail jewelry websites, including the design of plaintiff&#x27;s search pages. Although the court ordered more factual development before it could rule definitively on the issue, the court did hold that it was possible for the look and feel of the websites to have trade dress protection if the plaintiff&#x27;s copyright claims did not already cover those parts. In &quot;SG Services, Inc. v. God&#x27;s Girls, Inc.&quot;, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon denied trade dress protection for the plaintiff&#x27;s website because the plaintiff did not demonstrate that the website was non-functional or distinctive. This case shows the court&#x27;s willingness to consider trade dress protection for a website, even though the court did not find protection in this case. However, the &quot;SG Services&quot; court did not look at the overall &quot;look and feel&quot; of the website, but rather, at specific characteristics (such as color) of the website that the plaintiff claimed were infringed.

Although the future of trade dress protection for websites is still very unclear, much thought has been given to this area and it will likely continue to be actively developing area for courts and litigants.

==Similar concepts in other countries==

===China===

Although Chinese law does not recognize a concept of trade dress, the Anti-Unfair Competition Law (反不正当竞争法) does protect the packaging, decoration, or appearance of a &quot;well-known commodity&quot;; this provision accomplishes something similar to trade dress protections.

<text>TeamForge (formerly SourceForge Enterprise Edition or SFEE) is a proprietary collaborative application lifecycle management forge supporting version control and a software development management system.

== Background ==
TeamForge provides a front-end to a range of software development lifecycle services and integrates with a number of free software / open source software applications (such as PostgreSQL and Subversion).

Its predecessor, SourceForge, started as open source software, but a version of it (based on the v2.5 prototype code) was eventually relicensed under a proprietary software license as SourceForge Enterprise Edition, which was re-written in Java and marketed for offshore outsourcing software development.

The original codebase of SourceForge (code-named &quot;Alexandria&quot;) was forked by the GNU Project as GNU Savannah; then, Savannah was also modified at CERN and released as Savane. SourceForge was also later forked as GForge by one of the SourceForge programmers, and then GForge was itself forked as FusionForge by three GForge developers.

Originally sold by VA Software, SourceForge Enterprise Edition was acquired by CollabNet on April 24, 2007. CollabNet subsequently integrated SourceForge Enterprise Edition with its own CollabNet Enterprise Edition and product, taking architectural and product elements from both systems, and re-launched the enhanced product as TeamForge in 2008. Since 2007, TeamForge has continued to undergo development, adding in a series of application lifecycle management tools.

<text>SourceForge is a web service founded by Geoffrey B. Jeffery, Tim Perdue, and Drew Streib in November 1999. SourceForge provides a centralized software discovery platform, including an online platform for managing and hosting open-source software projects, and a business software comparison directory for comparing and reviewing B2B software that lists over 104,500 business software titles. It provides source code repository hosting, bug tracking, mirroring of downloads for load balancing, a wiki for documentation, developer and user mailing lists, user-support forums, user-written reviews and ratings, a news bulletin, micro-blog for publishing project updates, and other features.

SourceForge was one of the first to offer this service free of charge to open-source projects. Since 2012, the website has run on Apache Allura software. SourceForge offers free hosting and free access to tools for developers of free and open-source software.

, the SourceForge repository claimed to host more than 502,000 projects and had more than 3.7 million registered users.

== Concept ==
SourceForge is a web-based source code repository. It acts as a centralized location for free and open-source software projects. It was the first to offer this service for free to open-source projects. Project developers have access to centralized storage and tools for managing projects, though it is best known for providing revision control systems such as CVS, Subversion, Bazaar, Git and Mercurial. Major features (amongst others) include project wikis, metrics and analysis, access to a MySQL database, and unique sub-domain URLs (in the form codice_1).

The vast number of users at SourceForge.net (over three million as of 2013) exposes prominent projects to a variety of developers and can create a positive feedback loop. As a project&#x27;s activity rises, SourceForge.net&#x27;s internal ranking system makes it more visible to other developers through SourceForge directory and Enterprise Directory. Given that many open-source projects fail due to lack of developer support, exposure to such a large community of developers can continually breathe new life into a project. 

=== Revenue model ===
SourceForge&#x27;s traditional revenue model is through advertising banner sales on their site. In 2006, SourceForge Inc. reported quarterly takings of US$6.5 million. In 2009, SourceForge reported a gross quarterly income of US$23 million through media and e-commerce streams. In 2011, a revenue of US$20 million was reported for the combined value of the SourceForge, slashdot and freecode holdings, prior to SourceForge&#x27;s acquisition.

Since 2013, additional revenue generation schemes, such as bundleware models, have been trialled, with the goal of increasing SourceForge&#x27;s revenue. The result has in some cases been the appearance of malware bundled with SourceForge downloads. On February 9, 2016, SourceForge announced they had eliminated their DevShare program practice of bundling installers with project downloads.

Negative community reactions to the partnership program led to a review of the program, which was nonetheless opened up to all SourceForge projects on February 7, 2014. The program was canceled by new owners BIZX, LLC on February 9, 2016.

On May 17, 2016, they announced that it would scan all projects for malware and display warnings on downloads.

==History==
SourceForge, founded in 1999 by VA Software, was the first provider of a centralized location for free and open-source software developers to control and manage software development and offering this service free of charge. The software running the SourceForge site was released as free software in January 2000 and was later named SourceForge Alexandria. The last release under a free license was made in November 2001. After the dot-com bubble, SourceForge was later powered by the proprietary SourceForge Enterprise Edition, a separate product re-written in Java which was marketed for use in offshore outsourcing.

SourceForge has been temporarily banned in China three times: in September 2002, in July 2008 (for about a month) and on August 6, 2012 (for several days).

In November 2008, SourceForge was sued by the French collection society Société civile des Producteurs de Phonogrammes en France (SPPF) for hosting downloads of the file sharing application Shareaza.

In 2009, SourceForge announced a new site platform known as Allura, which would be an extensible, open source platform licensed under the Apache License, utilizing components such as Python and MongoDB, and offering REST APIs. In June 2012, the Allura project was donated to the Apache Software Foundation as Apache Allura.

In September 2012, SourceForge, Slashdot, and Freecode were acquired from Geeknet by the online job site Dice.com for $20 million, and incorporated into a subsidiary known as Slashdot Media. In July 2015, Dice announced that it planned to sell SourceForge and Slashdot, and, in January 2016, the two sites were sold to the San Diego–based BIZX, LLC for an undisclosed amount. In December 2019, BIZX rebranded as Slashdot Media.

On September 26, 2012, it was reported that attackers had compromised a SourceForge mirror, and modified a download of phpMyAdmin to add security exploits.

==Adware controversy==

In July 2013, SourceForge announced that it would provide project owners with an optional feature called &quot;DevShare&quot;, which places closed-source ad-supported content into the binary installers and gives the project part of the ad revenue. Opinions of this new feature varied; some complained about users not being as aware of what they are getting or being able to trust the downloaded content, whereas others saw it as a reasonably harmless option that keeps individual projects and users in control.

In November 2013, GIMP, a free image manipulation program, removed its download from SourceForge, citing misleading download buttons that potentially confuse customers as well as SourceForge&#x27;s own Windows installer, which bundles potentially unwanted programs with GIMP. In a statement, GIMP called SourceForge a &quot;once useful and trustworthy place to develop and host FLOSS applications&quot; that now faces &quot;a problem with the ads they allow on their sites&quot;.

In May 2015, SourceForge took control of pages for five projects that had migrated to other hosting sites and replaced the project downloads with adware-laden downloads, including GIMP. This came despite SourceForge&#x27;s commitment in November 2013 to never bundle adware with project downloads without developers&#x27; consent. 

On June 1, 2015, SourceForge claimed that they had stopped coupling &quot;third party offers&quot; with unmaintained SourceForge projects. Since this announcement was made, a number of other developers have reported that their SourceForge projects had been taken over by SourceForge staff accounts (but have not had binaries edited), including nmap and VLC media player.
On June 18, 2015, SourceForge announced that SourceForge-maintained mirrored projects were removed and anticipated the formation of a Community Panel to review their mirroring practices. No such Community Panel ever materialized, but SourceForge discontinued DevShare and the bundling of installers after SourceForge was sold to BizX in early 2016. On May 17, 2016, SourceForge announced that they were now scanning all projects for malware and displaying warnings on projects detected to have malware.

== Project of the Month ==
Since 2002, SourceForge has featured a pair of &quot;Projects of the Month&quot;, one chosen by its community and the other by its staff, but these have not been updated since December 2020.

==Usage==
, the SourceForge repository hosted more than 300,000 projects and had more than 3 million registered users, although not all were active. The domain &quot;sourceforge.net&quot; attracted at least 33 million visitors by August 2009 according to a Compete.com survey.

=== Country restrictions ===
In its terms of use, SourceForge states that its services are not available to users in countries on the sanction list of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria). Since 2008 the secure server used for making contributions to the site has blocked access from those countries. In January 2010, the site had blocked all access from those countries, including downloads. Any IP address that appeared to belong to one of those countries could not use the site. By the following month, SourceForge relaxed the restrictions so that individual projects could indicate whether or not SourceForge should block their software from download to those countries. This, however, had been reversed by November 2020 for North Korea and other countries. Crimea has been blocked since February 1, 2015.

<doc id="52229" wikidata="Q705" url="?curid=52229" title="Zeeland">
<text>Zeeland (; ), historically known in English by the exonym Zealand, is the westernmost and least populous province of the Netherlands. The province, located in the southwest of the country, borders North Brabant to the east, South Holland to the north, as well as the country of Belgium to the south and west. It consists of a number of islands and peninsulas (hence its name, meaning &quot;Sealand&quot;) and a strip bordering the Flemish provinces of East and West Flanders. Its capital is Middelburg with a population of 48,544 as of November 2019, although the largest municipality in Zeeland is Terneuzen (population 54,589). Zeeland has two seaports: Vlissingen and Terneuzen. Its area is , of which is water; it had a population of about 391,000 as of January 2023.

Large parts of Zeeland are below sea level. The last great flooding of the area was in 1953. Tourism is an important economic activity. In the summer, its beaches make it a popular destination for tourists, especially German tourists. In some areas, the population can be two to four times higher during the high summer season. The coat of arms of Zeeland shows a lion half-emerged from water, and the text (Latin for &quot;I struggle and emerge&quot;). The country of New Zealand was named after Zeeland after it was sighted by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman.

== History ==
Zeeland was a contested area between the counts of Holland and Flanders until 1299, when the last count of Holland died. The Counts of Hainaut then gained control of the County of Zeeland, followed by the counts of Bavaria, Burgundy, and Habsburg. After 1585, Zeeland followed, as one of the 7 independent provinces, the fate of the Northern part of The Netherlands.

In 1432, it became part of the Low Countries possessions of Philip the Good of Burgundy, the later Seventeen Provinces. Through marriage, the Seventeen Provinces became the property of the Habsburgs in 1477. In the Eighty Years&#x27; War, Zeeland was on the side of the Union of Utrecht, and became one of the United Provinces. The area now called &#x27; (or Zeelandic Flanders) was not part of Zeeland, but a part of the county of Flanders (still under Habsburg control) that was conquered by the United Provinces, hence called &#x27; (see: Generality Lands).

After the French occupation (see &quot;&quot; Bouches-de-l&#x27;Escaut) and the formation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815, the present province Zeeland was formed.

During World War II, Zeeland was occupied by Nazi Germany between June 1940 and November 1944. In 1944, Zeeland was devastated by the Battle of the Scheldt and the Walcheren Landings, which brought about the Inundation of Walcheren, between British and Canadian forces, and the occupying Germans.

The catastrophic North Sea flood of 1953, which killed over 1800 people in Zeeland, led to the construction of the protective Delta Works.

== Geography ==
The province of Zeeland is a large river delta situated at the mouth of several major rivers, namely Scheldt (&#x27;Schelde&#x27;), Rhine (&#x27;Rijn&#x27;) and Meuse (&#x27;Maas&#x27;). Most of the province lies below sea level and was reclaimed from the sea by inhabitants over time. What used to be a muddy landscape, flooding at high tide and reappearing at low tide, became a series of small man-made hills that stayed dry at all times. The people of the province would later connect the hills by creating dikes, which led to a chain of dry land that later grew into bigger islands and gave the province its current shape. The shape of the islands has changed over time at the hands of both people and nature.

The North Sea flood of 1953 inundated vast amounts of land that were only partially reclaimed. The subsequent construction of the Delta Works also changed the face of the province. The infrastructure, although very distinct by the number of bridges, tunnels and dams, has not shaped the geography of the province so much as the geography of the province has shaped its infrastructure. The dams, tunnels and bridges that are currently a vital part of the province&#x27;s road system were constructed over the span of decades and came to replace old ferry lines. The final touch to this process came in 2003 when the Western Scheldt Tunnel was opened. It was the first solid connection between both banks of the Western Scheldt and ended the era of water separating the islands and peninsulas of Zeeland.

Zeeland consists of several islands and peninsulas. These are, from north to south, Schouwen-Duiveland, Tholen, Noord-Beveland, Walcheren and Zuid-Beveland. It also includes a strip of land bordering the Belgian region of Flanders, the Zeelandic Flanders.

=== Municipalities ===
The province of Zeeland has 13 municipalities:
The largest cities are: Middelburg with 42,000 inhabitants; Vlissingen with 34,000; Goes with 28,000; and Terneuzen with 25,000.

== Demographics ==

=== Religion ===
Zeeland is more religious than the Netherlands as a whole, with over 53% being religious. The Dutch Bible Belt runs through Zeeland. Zeelandic Flanders is more religious (58.5%) than the rest of Zeeland (51.6%). Among the religious population, Reformed Christianity (Calvinism) is dominant. About 16% of residents are Roman Catholic.

After being long part of the vast Franco-Flemish Roman Catholic Diocese of Cambrai, Zeeland got its own bishopric, the Diocese of Middelburg, on 5 December 1559, which was suppressed in 1603, its territory being merged into the Apostolic Vicariate of Batavia, only to be &#x27;restored&#x27; on 22 March 1803 as the Apostolic Vicariate of Breda, which was promoted to the present large (yet counting few faithful) Diocese of Breda, whose See is in the other part, western North Brabant, and enlarged further in 1955, gaining territory from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Haarlem–Amsterdam.

== Politics ==
=== Provincial council ===
The States of Zeeland is the provincial council of Zeeland. As of the 2023 provincial election, the governing coalition consists of the BBB, SGP, CDA, and VVD, with 23 of 39 seats.
=== Provincial executive ===
The Provincial executive (&quot;Gedeputeerde Staten&quot;) of Zeeland is the executive branch of the province, which consists of several ministers and the King&#x27;s commissioner of Zeeland. Han Polman (D66) has been the commissioner since 2013.

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 13.6 billion € in 2018, accounting for 1.8% of the Netherlands economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €30,900, or 102% of the EU27 average that year.

==Legend==
Nehalennia is a mythological goddess of an ancient religion known around the province of Zeeland. Her worship dates back at least to the 2nd century BC, and flourished in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. She was possibly a regional god, either Celtic or pre-Germanic – but sources differ on the culture that first worshipped her. During the Roman era, her main function appeared to be the protection of travelers, especially seagoing travelers crossing the North Sea. Most of what is known about her mythology comes from the remains of carved stone offerings (votives) which have been dredged up from the Oosterschelde (Eastern Scheldt) since 1870. Two more Nehalennia offering stones have also been found in Cologne, Germany.
&quot;Provinciale Zeeuwse Courant&quot; and &quot;BN/De Stem&quot; are the regional daily newspapers in the province.

==Namesakes==
The first westerners to sight New Zealand were captained by Dutch navigator Abel Tasman in 1642, although he did not land there. Tasman named it &quot;Staten Landt&quot;, believing it to be part of the land of that name off the coast of Argentina that is now known as Isla de los Estados. When that was shown not to be so, Dutch authorities named it &quot;Nova Zeelandia&quot; in Latin, &quot;Nieuw Zeeland&quot; in Dutch. The two major seafaring provinces of the Netherlands in its Golden Age were Holland and Zeeland, and the Dutch explorers originally named the largest landmass of Oceania and the two islands to the southeast Nieuw Holland and Nieuw Zeeland, respectively. The former was eventually replaced by the name Australia, but the name New Zealand remained in place for the latter. Captain James Cook of Britain later anglicised the name to &quot;New Zealand&quot; and, after British settlers arrived in New Zealand, English became the main language.

The city of Zeeland in the US state of Michigan was settled in 1847 by Dutchman Jannes van de Luyster and was incorporated in 1907. Flushing, a neighborhood within the borough of Queens, New York, is named after the city Flushing (Vlissingen in Dutch) in Zeeland. This dates from the period of the colony of New Netherland, when New York was still known as New Amsterdam. The Dutch colonies of Nieuw Walcheren and Nieuw Vlissingen, both on the Antillian island of Tobago, were both named after parts of Zeeland. The Canadian town of Zealand, New Brunswick, was named for the Zeeland birthplace of Dutchman Philip Crouse who settled in the area in 1789. Zeeland, North Dakota is another town named for this province and whose earliest settlers were of Dutch heritage.

Paramaribo, the capital and largest city of Suriname, has a Fort Zeelandia, the former Fort Willoughby during British colonization.

Fort Zeelandia was a fortress built over ten years from 1624 to 1634 by the Dutch East India Company, in the town of Anping (Tainan) on the island of Formosa, present day Taiwan, during their 38-year rule over the western part of it.

<doc id="52230" wikidata="Q35765" url="?curid=52230" title="Osaka">
<text>is a designated city in the Kansai region of Honshu in Japan. It is the capital of and most populous city in Osaka Prefecture, and the third-most populous city in Japan, following the special wards of Tokyo and Yokohama. With a population of 2.7 million in the 2020 census, it is also the largest component of the Keihanshin Metropolitan Area, which is the second-largest metropolitan area in Japan and the 10th-largest urban area in the world with more than 19 million inhabitants.

Ōsaka was traditionally considered Japan&#x27;s economic hub. By the Kofun period (300–538) it had developed into an important regional port, and in the 7th and 8th centuries, it served briefly as the imperial capital. Osaka continued to flourish during the Edo period (1603–1867) and became known as a center of Japanese culture. Following the Meiji Restoration, Osaka greatly expanded in size and underwent rapid industrialization. In 1889, Osaka was officially established as a municipality. The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades, and by the 1900s, Osaka was the industrial hub in the Meiji and Taishō periods. Osaka made noted contributions to redevelopment, urban planning and zoning standards in the postwar period, and the city developed rapidly as one of the major financial centers in the Keihanshin Metropolitan Area.

Osaka is a major financial center of Japan, and it is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in Japan. The city is home to the Osaka Exchange as well as the headquarters of multinational electronics corporations such as Panasonic and Sharp. Osaka is an international center of research and development and is represented by several major universities, notably Osaka University, Osaka Metropolitan University, and Kansai University. Famous landmarks in the city include Osaka Castle, Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan, Dōtonbori, Tsūtenkaku in Shinsekai, Tennōji Park, Abeno Harukas, Sumiyoshi Taisha Grand Shrine, and Shitennō-ji, one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Japan.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Ōsaka&quot; means &quot;large hill&quot; or &quot;large slope&quot;. It is unclear when this name gained prominence over Naniwa, but the oldest written evidence for the name dates back to 1496.

By the Edo period, (&quot;Ōsaka&quot;) and (&quot;Ōsaka&quot;) were mixed use, and the writer , in his book &quot;Setsuyo Ochiboshu&quot; published in 1808, states that the kanji was abhorred because it means &quot;returns to the earth,&quot; and thus was used. The kanji (earth) is also similar to the word (knight), and means against, so can be understood as &quot;samurai rebellion.&quot; was the official name in 1868 after the Meiji Restoration. The older kanji (坂) is still in very limited use, usually only in historical contexts. When used as an abbreviation, the modern kanji refers to Osaka City or Osaka Prefecture.

== History ==
=== Origins: Jōmon and Yayoi period ===
During the Jōmon period (7,000 BCE), present-day Osaka was mostly submerged, and the formed a 12 km long and 2.5 km wide peninsula separating Kawachi Bay from the Seto Inland Sea. It is considered one of the first places where inhabitants of Japan settled, both for the favorable geological conditions, rich in fresh water and lush vegetation, and because its position was defensible against military attack.
The earliest evidence of settlements in the Osaka area are the which is located in the central Chuo-ku district. Buried human skeletons and a kaizuka (a mound containing remains), were found as well as shell mounds, oysters, and other interesting archeological discoveries from the Jomon period. In addition to the remains of consumed food, there were arrow heads, stone tools, fishing hooks and crockery with remains from rice processing. It is estimated that the ruins contain 2,000-year-old debris between the Jomon and Yayoi period. The findings of the archeological sites are exhibited in an adjacent building.

In the years between the end of the Jōmon period and the beginning of the Yayoi period, the sediments that were deposited north of the Uemachi peninsula / plateau transformed Kawachi Bay into a lagoon. During the Yayoi period (300 BCE-250 CE), permanent habitation on the plains grew as rice farming became popular.

At the beginning of the third century CE the grand shrine of Sumiyoshi-taisha was inaugurated near the harbor, commissioned by consort Empress Jingū. This Shinto shrine structure survived historical events, which inaugurated a new style in the construction of Shinto shrines, called Sumiyoshi-zukuri. The maritime panorama enjoyed from the shrine gardens inspired several artists, and nowadays the representations of that type of landscape are called &quot;Sumiyoshi drawings&quot;.

Towards the end of the Yayoi period the Uemachi plateau-peninsula expanded further, transforming the Kawachi Lagoon into a lake (河内湖) connected to the mouth of the Yodo River, which had widened to the south.

=== Kofun period ===
By the Kofun period, Osaka developed into a hub port connecting the region to the western part of Japan. The port of Naniwa-tsu was established and became the most important in Japan. Trade with other areas of the country and the Asian continent intensified. The large numbers of increasingly larger keyhole-shaped Kofun mounds found in the plains of Osaka are evidence of political-power concentration, leading to the formation of a state. The findings in the neighboring plains, including the mausoleum of Emperor Nintoku was discovered nearby in Sakai testify to the status of imperial city that Osaka had reached. Four of these mounds can be seen in Osaka, in which important members of the nobility are buried. They are located in the southern districts of the city and date back to the 5th century. A group of megalithic tombs called Mozu Tombs are located in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture.

Important works of the Kofun period is the excavation that diverted the course of the Yamato River, whose floods caused extensive damage, and the construction of important roads in the direction of Sakai and Nara. Maritime traffic connected to the port of Naniwa-tsu increased in such a way that huge warehouses were built to stow material arriving and departing.

=== Asuka and Nara period ===
The Kojiki records that during 390–430 CE, there was an imperial palace located at Osumi, in what is present day Higashiyodogawa ward, but it may have been a secondary imperial residence rather than a capital.

In 645, Emperor Kōtoku built his Naniwa Nagara-Toyosaki Palace in what is now Osaka, making it the capital of Japan. The city now known as Osaka was at this time referred to as Naniwa (written as or ) and this name and derivations of it are still in use for districts in central Osaka such as Naniwa () and Namba (). Although the capital was moved to Asuka (in Nara Prefecture today) in 655, Naniwa remained a vital connection, by land and sea, between Yamato (modern day Nara Prefecture), Korea, and China.

Naniwa was declared the capital again in 744 by order of Emperor Shōmu, and remained so until 745, when the Imperial Court moved back to Heijō-kyō (now Nara). By the end of the Nara period, Naniwa&#x27;s seaport roles had been gradually taken over by neighboring areas, but it remained a lively center of river, channel, and land transportation between Heian-kyō (Kyoto today) and other destinations. Sumiyoshi Taisha Grand Shrine was founded by Tamomi no Sukune in 211 CE. Shitennō-ji was first built in 593 CE and is the oldest Buddhist temple in Japan.

=== Heian to Edo period ===
In 1496, Jōdo Shinshū Buddhists established their headquarters in the heavily fortified Ishiyama Hongan-ji, located directly on the site of the old Naniwa Imperial Palace. Oda Nobunaga began a decade-long siege campaign on the temple in 1570 which ultimately resulted in the surrender of the monks and subsequent razing of the temple. Toyotomi Hideyoshi constructed Osaka Castle in its place in 1583. Osaka Castle played a pivotal role in the Siege of Osaka (1614–1615)

Osaka was long considered Japan&#x27;s primary economic center, with a large percentage of the population belonging to the merchant class (see Four divisions of society). Over the course of the Edo period (1603–1867), Osaka grew into one of Japan&#x27;s major cities and returned to its ancient role as a lively and important port. &quot;Daimyōs&quot; (feudal lords) received most of their income in the form of rice. Merchants in Osaka thus began to organize storehouses where they would store a &quot;daimyō&quot;″s rice in exchange for a fee, trading it for either coin or a form of receipt; essentially a precursor to paper money. Many if not all of these rice brokers also made loans, and would actually become quite wealthy and powerful. Osaka merchants coalesced their shops around Dōjima, where the Rice Exchange was established in 1697 and where the world&#x27;s first futures market would come to exist to sell rice that was not yet harvested.

The popular culture of Osaka was closely related to &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; depictions of life in Edo. By 1780, Osaka had cultivated a vibrant arts culture, as typified by its famous Kabuki and Bunraku theaters. In 1837, Ōshio Heihachirō, a low-ranking samurai, led a peasant insurrection in response to the city&#x27;s unwillingness to support the many poor and suffering families in the area. Approximately one-quarter of the city was razed before shogunal officials put down the rebellion, after which Ōshio killed himself. Osaka was opened to foreign trade by the government of the Bakufu at the same time as Hyogo Town (modern Kobe) on January 1, 1868, just before the advent of the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration. The Kawaguchi foreign settlement, now the Kawaguchi subdistrict, is a legacy of the foreign presence in Osaka.

Osaka residents were stereotyped in Edo literature from at least the 18th century. Jippensha Ikku in 1802 depicted Osakans as stingy almost beyond belief. In 1809, the derogatory term &quot;Kamigata zeeroku&quot; was used by Edo residents to characterize inhabitants of the Osaka region in terms of calculation, shrewdness, lack of civic spirit, and the vulgarity of Osaka dialect. Edo writers aspired to samurai culture, and saw themselves as poor but generous, chaste, and public spirited. Edo writers by contrast saw &quot;zeeroku&quot; as obsequious apprentices, stingy, greedy, gluttonous, and lewd. To some degree, Osaka residents are still stigmatized by Tokyo observers in the same way today, especially in terms of gluttony, evidenced in the phrase, .

=== Meiji to Heisei period ===
With the enormous changes that characterized the country after the Meiji Restoration (1868), and the relocation of the capital from Kyoto to Tokyo, Osaka entered a period of decline. From being the capital of the economy and finance, it became a predominantly industrial center. The modern municipality was established in 1889 by government ordinance, with an initial area of , overlapping today&#x27;s Chuo and Nishi wards. Later, the city went through three major expansions to reach its current size of . Osaka was the industrial center most clearly defined in the development of capitalism in Japan. It became known as the &quot;Manchester and Melbourne of the Orient&quot;. In 1925, it was the largest and most populous city in Japan and sixth in the world.

The rapid industrialization attracted many Asian immigrants (Indians, Chinese, and Koreans), who set up a life apart for themselves. The political system was pluralistic, with a strong emphasis on promoting industrialization and modernization. Literacy was high and the educational system expanded rapidly, producing a middle class with a taste for literature and a willingness to support the arts. In 1927, General Motors operated a factory called Osaka Assembly until 1941, manufacturing Chevrolet, Cadillac, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick vehicles, operated and staffed by Japanese workers and managers. In the nearby city of Ikeda in Osaka Prefecture is the headquarters of Daihatsu, one of Japan&#x27;s oldest automobile manufacturers.

Like its European and American counterparts, Osaka displayed slums, unemployment, and poverty. In Japan it was here that municipal government first introduced a comprehensive system of poverty relief, copied in part from British models. Osaka policymakers stressed the importance of family formation and mutual assistance as the best way to combat poverty. This minimized the cost of welfare programs.

During World War II, Osaka came under air raids in 1945 by the United States Army Air Forces as part of the air raids on Japan. On March 13, 1945, a total of 329 Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers took part in the raid against Osaka. According to an American prisoner of war who was held in the city, the air raid took almost the entire night and destroyed of the city. The U.S. bombed the city again twice in June 1945 and again on August 14, a day before Japan&#x27;s surrender.

In the decades after World War II, the reconstruction plan and the industriousness of its inhabitants ensured Osaka even greater prosperity than it had before the war. Osaka&#x27;s population regrew to more than three million in the 1960s when large-scale prefectural suburbanization began and doubled to six million by the 1990s. The factories were rebuilt and trade revived, the city were developed rapidly it became a major multicultural and financial center in the postwar period between the 1950s and the 1980s, it is known as the &quot;Chicago and Toronto of the Orient&quot;. Osaka Prefecture was chosen as the venue for the prestigious Expo &#x27;70, the first world&#x27;s fair ever held in an Asian country. Since then, numerous international events have been held in Osaka, including the 1995 APEC Summit.

The modern municipality, which when it was established in 1889 occupied an area of just 15 km2 including the districts of Chūō and Nishi, following three successive expansions has reached an area of 222 km2. It was one of the first cities in Japan to obtain designated city status in 1956.

===21st century to present===
The plan to reorganize Osaka and its province into a metropolis like Tokyo met with stiff opposition in some municipalities, particularly the highly populated Sakai. He then fell back on a project that included the suppression of the 24 wards of Osaka, thus dividing the city into 5 new special districts with a status similar to that of the 23 Special wards of Tokyo. It was introduced by former mayor Tōru Hashimoto, leader of the reform party Osaka Restoration Association which he founded. The referendum of May 17, 2015 called in Osaka for the approval of this project saw the narrow victory of no, and consequently Hashimoto announced his withdrawal from politics. A second referendum for a merger into 4 semi-autonomous wards was narrowly voted down by 692,996 (50.6%).

According to the Forbes list of &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Expensive Places To Live 2009&quot;, Osaka was the second most expensive in the world after Tokyo. By 2020 it slipped to 5th rank of most expensive cities.

On 7 March 2014, the 300-metre tall Abeno Harukas opened, which became the tallest building in Japan (surpassing the Yokohama Landmark Tower in Yokohama), until it was in turn surpassed by the 330-metre tall Azabudai Hills Main Tower in Tokyo following its completion in 2022.

The Expo 2025 will be held at Yumeshima Island, Konohana-ku, it became the third city since hosted Expo 1970 and 1990; the third in Japan since Expo &#x27;70 and Expo 2005 in Aichi Prefecture. The event will return to its traditional 5-year scheduling cycle after the Expo 2020 in Dubai was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The projected visitor count is approximately 28 million.

MGM Resorts will begin construction of MGM Osaka in April 2025. MGM Osaka will be the first integrated resort in Japan. It will include 2,300 hotel rooms, a casino, shopping and dining options, convention space and a 3,500 seat theatre. 

== Geography ==

The city&#x27;s west side is open to Osaka Bay, and is otherwise completely surrounded by more than ten satellite cities, all of them in Osaka Prefecture, with one exception: the city of Amagasaki, belonging to Hyōgo Prefecture, in the northwest. The city occupies a larger area (about 13%) than any other city or village within Osaka Prefecture. When the city was established in 1889, it occupied roughly the area known today as the Chuo and Nishi wards, only that would eventually grow into today&#x27;s via incremental expansions, the largest of which being a single expansion in 1925. Osaka&#x27;s highest point is Tokyo Peil in Tsurumi-ku, and the lowest point is in Nishiyodogawa-ku at Tokyo Peil. Osaka has a latitude of 34.67 (near the 35th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), San Francisco (37.77) and Seoul (37.53).

=== Climate ===
Osaka is located in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with four distinct seasons. Its winters are generally mild, with January being the coldest month having an average high of . The city rarely sees snowfall during the winter. Spring in Osaka starts off mild, but ends up being hot and humid. It also tends to be Osaka&#x27;s wettest season, with the —the rainy season—occurring between early June and late July. The average starting and ending dates of the rainy season are June 7 and July 21 respectively. Summers are very hot and humid. In August, the hottest month, the average daily high temperature reaches , while average nighttime low temperatures typically hover around . Fall in Osaka sees a cooling trend, with the early part of the season resembling summer while the latter part of fall resembles winter. Precipitation is abundant, with winter being the driest season, while monthly rainfall peaks in June with the &quot;tsuyu&quot; rainy season, which typically ends in mid to late July. From late July through the end of August, summer&#x27;s heat and humidity peaks, and rainfall decreases somewhat. Osaka experiences a second rainy period in September and early October, when tropical weather systems, including typhoons, coming from the south or southwest are possible.

== Cityscape ==
Osaka&#x27;s sprawling cityscape has been described as &quot;only surpassed by Tokyo as a showcase of the Japanese urban phenomenon&quot;.


=== Neighborhoods ===
Central Osaka is roughly divided into downtown and uptown areas known as and .

Kita is home to the Umeda district and its immediate surrounding neighborhoods, a major business and retail hub that plays host to Osaka Station City and a large subterranean network of shopping arcades. Kita and nearby Nakanoshima contain a prominent portion of the city&#x27;s skyscrapers and are often featured in photographs of Osaka&#x27;s skyline.

Minami, though meaning &quot;south&quot;, is essentially in and geographically central within the city. Well known districts here include Namba and Shinsaibashi shopping areas, the Dōtonbori canal entertainment area, Nipponbashi Den Den Town, as well as arts and fashion culture-oriented areas such as Amerikamura and Horie. The 300-meter tall Abeno Harukas was the tallest skyscraper in the country from 2014 until 2023.

The business districts between Kita and Minami such as and , called , house the regional headquarters of many large-scale banks and corporations. The Midōsuji boulevard runs through Semba and connects Kita and Minami.

Further south of Minami are neighborhoods such as Shinsekai (with its Tsūtenkaku tower), Tennoji and Abeno (with Tennoji Zoo, Shitennō-ji and Abeno Harukas), and the Kamagasaki slums, the largest slum in Japan.

The city&#x27;s west side is a prominent bay area which serves as its main port as well as a tourist destination with attractions such as Kyocera Dome, Universal Studios Japan and the Tempozan Harbor Village. Higashiosaka is zoned as a separate city, although the east side of Osaka city proper contains numerous residential neighborhoods including Tsuruhashi KoreaTown, as well as the Osaka Castle Park, Osaka Business Park and the hub Kyōbashi Station.

Osaka contains numerous urban canals and bridges, many of which serve as the namesake for their surrounding neighborhoods. The phrase &quot;808 bridges of Naniwa&quot; was an expression in old Japan used to indicate impressiveness and the &quot;uncountable&quot;. Osaka numbered roughly 200 bridges by the Edo period and 1,629 bridges by 1925. As many of the city&#x27;s canals were gradually filled in, the number dropped to 872, of which 760 are currently managed by Osaka City.

==List of wards==

There are currently 24 wards in Osaka:
== Demographics ==
Population numbers have been recorded in Osaka since as early as 1873, in the early Meiji era. According to the census in 2005, there were 2,628,811 residents in Osaka, an increase of 30,037 or 1.2% from 2000. There were 1,280,325 households with approximately 2.1 persons per household. The population density was 11,836 persons per km2. The Great Kantō earthquake caused a mass migration to Osaka between 1920 and 1930, and the city became Japan&#x27;s largest city in 1930 with 2,453,573 people, outnumbering even Tokyo, which had a population of 2,070,913. The population peaked at 3,252,340 in 1940, and had a post-war peak of 3,156,222 in 1965, but has declined since, as the residents moved out to the suburbs.

There were 144,123 registered foreigners, the two largest groups being Korean (60,110) and Chinese (39,551). Ikuno, with its Tsuruhashi district, is the home to one of the largest population of Korean residents in Japan, with 20,397 registered Zainichi Koreans.

=== Dialect ===

The commonly spoken dialect of this area is &quot;Osaka-ben&quot;, a typical sub-dialect of &quot;Kansai-ben&quot;. Of the many other particularities that characterize Osaka-ben, examples include using the copula &quot;ya&quot; instead of &quot;da&quot;, and the suffix &quot;-hen&quot; instead of &quot;-nai&quot; in negative verb forms.

== Government ==
The Osaka City Council is the city&#x27;s local government formed under the Local Autonomy Law. The council has eighty-nine seats, allocated to the twenty-four wards proportional to their population and re-elected by the citizens every four years. The council elects its president and Vice President. Toshifumi Tagaya (LDP) is the current and 104th president since May 2008. The mayor of the city is directly elected by the citizens every four years as well, in accordance with the Local Autonomy Law. Tōru Hashimoto, former governor of Osaka Prefecture is the 19th mayor of Osaka since 2011. The mayor is supported by two vice mayors, currently Akira Morishita and Takashi Kashiwagi, who are appointed by him in accordance with the city bylaw.

===Developments===
In July 2012, a joint multi-party bill was submitted to the Diet that would allow for implementation of the Osaka Metropolis plan as pursued by the mayor of Osaka city, the governor of Osaka and their party. If implemented, Osaka City, neighboring Sakai City and possibly other surrounding municipalities would dissolve and be reorganized as four special wards of Osaka prefecture – similar to former Tokyo City&#x27;s successor wards within Tokyo prefecture. Special wards are municipal-level administrative units that leave some otherwise municipal administrative responsibilities and revenues to the prefectural administration.

In October 2018, the city of Osaka officially ended its sister city relationship with San Francisco in the United States after the latter permitted a monument memorializing &quot;comfort women&quot; to remain on a city-owned property, circulating in the process a 10-page, 3,800-word letter in English addressed to San Francisco mayor London Breed.

On November 1, 2020, a second referendum to merge Osaka&#x27;s 24 wards into 4 semi-autonomous wards was narrowly voted down. There were 692,996 (50.6%) votes against and 675,829 (49.4%) votes supported it. Osaka mayor and Osaka Ishin co-leader Ichiro Matsui said he would resign when his term ended in 2023.

=== Energy policies ===
==== Nuclear power ====
On February 27, 2012, three Kansai cities, Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, jointly asked Kansai Electric Power Company to break its dependence on nuclear power. In a letter to KEPCO they also requested to disclose information on the demand and supply of electricity, and for lower and stable prices. The three cities were stockholders of the plant: Osaka owned 9% of the shares, while Kobe had 3% and Kyoto 0.45%. Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, announced a proposal to minimize the dependence on nuclear power for the shareholders meeting in June 2012.

On March 18, 2012, the city of Osaka decided as largest shareholder of Kansai Electric Power Co, that at the next shareholders-meeting in June 2012 it would demand a series of changes:
* that Kansai Electric would be split into two companies, separating power generation from power transmission.
* a reduction of the number of the utility&#x27;s executives and employees.
* the implementation of absolutely secure measurements to ensuring the safety of the nuclear facilities.
* the disposing of spent fuel.
* the installation of new kind of thermal power generation to secure non-nuclear supply of energy.
* selling all unnecessary assets including the stock holdings of KEPCO.
In this action, Osaka had secured the support of two other cities and shareholders: Kyoto and Kobe, but with their combined voting-rights of 12.5 percent they were not certain of the ultimate outcome, because for this two-thirds of the shareholders would be needed to agree to revise the corporate charter.

At a meeting held on April 10, 2012, by the &quot;energy strategy council&quot;, formed by the city of Osaka and the governments of the prefectures, it became clear that at the end of the fiscal year 2011 some 69 employees of Kansai Electric Power Company were former public servants. &quot;Amakudari&quot; was the Japanese name for this practice of rewarding by hiring officials that formerly controlled and supervised the firm. Such people included the following:
* 13 ex-officials of the: Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism
* 3 ex-officials of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry,
* 2 ex-officials of the Ministry of the Environment,
* 16 former policemen,
* 10 former fire-fighters,
* 13 former civil engineers.

Besides this, it became known that Kansai Electric had done about 600 external financial donations, to a total sum of about 1.695 billion yen:
* 70 donations were paid to local governments: to a total of 699 million yen
* 100 donations to public-service organizations: 443 million yen,
* 430 donations to various organizations and foundations: a total of 553 million yen
During this meeting some 8 conditions were compiled, that needed to be fulfilled before a restart of the No.3 and No.4 reactors Oi Nuclear Power Plant:
* the consent of the local people and government within 100 kilometer from the plant
* the installation of a new independent regulatory agency
* a nuclear safety agreement
* the establishment of new nuclear safety standards
* stress tests and evaluations based on these new safety rules

== Economy ==

The gross city product of Osaka in fiscal year 2004 was ¥21.3 trillion, an increase of 1.2% over the previous year. The figure accounts for about 55% of the total output in the Osaka Prefecture and 26.5% in the Kinki region. In 2004, commerce, services, and manufacturing have been the three major industries, accounting for 30%, 26%, and 11% of the total, respectively. The per capita income in the city was about ¥3.3 million, 10% higher than that of the Osaka Prefecture. MasterCard Worldwide reported that Osaka ranks 19th among the world&#x27;s leading cities and plays an important role in the global economy. Osaka&#x27;s GDP per capita (Nominal) was $59,958.($1=\120.13) However, by 2020, Osaka ranked as the 5th most expensive city due to flatlining consumer prices and government subsidies of public transportation.
Historically, Osaka was the center of commerce in Japan, especially in the middle and pre-modern ages. Nomura Securities, the first brokerage firm in Japan, was founded in the city in 1925, and Osaka still houses a leading futures exchange. Many major companies have since moved their main offices to Tokyo. However, several major companies, such as Panasonic, Sharp, and Sanyo, are still headquartered in Osaka. Recently, the city began a program, headed by mayor Junichi Seki, to attract domestic and foreign investment. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Osaka was ranked as having the 15th most competitive financial center in the world and fifth most competitive in Asia (after Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Shanghai).

The Osaka Securities Exchange, specializing in derivatives such as Nikkei 225 futures, is based in Osaka. The merger with JASDAQ will help the Osaka Securities Exchange become the largest exchange in Japan for start-up companies.

According to global consulting firm Mercer, Osaka was the second most expensive city for expatriate employees in the world in 2009. It jumped up nine places from 11th place in 2008 and was the eighth most expensive city in 2007. However, it was not ranked in the top ten places of the list in 2013. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) ranked Osaka as the second most expensive city in the world in its 2013 Cost of Living study.

Osaka is known for its fine sake, which is made with fresh water from the prefecture&#x27;s mountains. Osaka&#x27;s culinary prevalence is the result of a location that has provided access to high-quality ingredients, a high population of merchants, and proximity to the ocean and waterway trade. In recent years, Osaka has started to garner more attention from foreigners with the increased popularity of cooking and dining in popular culture.

Osaka once had a large number of universities and high schools, but because of growing campuses and the need for larger area, many chose to move to the suburbs, including Osaka University.

Historically foreign expatriates in the Kansai region preferred to live in Kobe rather than Osaka. As a result, until 1991 the Osaka area had no schools catering to expatriate children. Osaka International School of Kwansei Gakuin, founded in 1991, is located in nearby Minoh, and it was the first international school in the Osaka area. The Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake of 1995 caused a decline in demand for international schools, as there were about 2,500 U.S. nationals resident in Osaka after the earthquake while the pre-earthquake number was about 5,000. American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ) Kansai chapter president Norman Solberg stated that since 2002 the numbers of expatriates in Kansai were recovering &quot;but the fact is there is still a persistent exodus to Tokyo.&quot; In 2001 the city of Osaka and YMCA established the Osaka YMCA International School.

<text>The Mauritshuis (, ; ) is an art museum in The Hague, Netherlands. The museum houses the Royal Cabinet of Paintings which consists of 854 objects, mostly Dutch Golden Age paintings. The collection contains works by Johannes Vermeer, Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen, Paulus Potter, Frans Hals, Jacob van Ruisdael, Hans Holbein the Younger, and others. Originally, the 17th-century building was the residence of Count John Maurice of Nassau. The building is now the property of the government of the Netherlands and is listed in the top 100 Dutch heritage sites.

== History ==
In 1631, John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, a cousin of Stadtholder Frederick Henry, bought a plot bordering the Binnenhof and the adjacent Hofvijver pond in The Hague, at that time the political centre of the Dutch Republic. Between 1636 and 1641, the Mauritshuis was built on this piece of land, during John Maurice&#x27;s governorship of Dutch Brazil. It was built in the Dutch Classicist style by the Dutch architects Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post. The two-storey building is strictly symmetrical; originally the interior contained four apartments and a great hall. Each apartment was designed with an antechamber, a chamber, a cabinet, and a cloakroom. The building had a cupola, which was destroyed in a fire in 1704.

After the death of Prince John Maurice in 1679, the house was owned by the Maes family, who leased the house to the Dutch government. In 1704, most of the interior of the Mauritshuis was destroyed by fire. The building was restored between 1708 and 1718.

In 1774, an art gallery open to the public was formed in what is now the Prince William V Gallery. That collection was seized by the French in 1795 and only partially recovered in 1808. The small gallery space soon proved to be too small, however, and in 1820, the Mauritshuis was bought by the Dutch state for the purpose of housing the Royal Cabinet of Paintings. In 1822, the Mauritshuis was opened to the public and housed the Royal Cabinet of Paintings and the Royal Cabinet of Rarities. In 1875, the entire museum became available for paintings.

In 1995, the Mauritshuis was established as a non-profit foundation. The foundation set up at that time took charge of both the building and the collection, which it was given on long-term loan. This building, which is the property of the state, continues to be rented by the museum. In 2007, the museum announced its desire to expand. Within three years the definitive design was presented. The museum would occupy a part of the nearby Sociëteit de Witte building. The two buildings would be connected via a tunnel, running underneath the Korte Vijverberg. 

The renovation started in 2012 and finished in 2014. The design was by Hans van Heeswijk. During the renovation, about 100 of the museum&#x27;s paintings were displayed in The Hague&#x27;s Kunstmuseum in the &quot;Highlights Mauritshuis&quot; exhibition. About 50 other paintings, including the &quot;Girl With the Pearl Earring&quot;, went on loan to exhibitions in the United States and Japan. The expanded museum was reopened on 27 June 2014 by King Willem-Alexander.

==Controversy over the colonial past of Prince Maurice==

In 1664 Prince John Maurice ordered a marble bust portrait of himself for the garden of the Mauritshuis, the Prince&#x27;s residence in the Hague. The statue was sculpted by the Flemish sculptor Bartholomeus Eggers. Prince Maurice had the bust moved to the burial chamber (Fürstengruft) in Siegen which he had built for himself in 1670.

In 1986 a copy of the statue made in plastic was placed inside the Mauritshuis. The bust was removed from the Mauritshuis in 2017 amidst controversy over Holland&#x27;s colonial history and Prince John Maurice&#x27;s role in the slave trade. The Mauritshuis museum has denied that the removal had anything to do with the controversy and has stated that the decision was taken on the grounds that the object was solely a copy made of plastic and the museum was unable to offer the necessary historical context for it in the foyer of the Mauritshuis where it was exhibited. The museum has since created a webpage dedicated to explaining the role of the Prince in the creation of the museum&#x27;s building and collection and the museum&#x27;s current view of the Prince. The statements on the page highlight the key role the Prince played in the slave trade in Brazil and how his immense wealth was likely sourced (in certain cases even in breach of then existing rules) from his involvement in the slave trade.

==Collection==

The collection of paintings of stadholder William V, Prince of Orange was presented to the Dutch state by his son, King William I. This collection formed the basis of the Royal Cabinet of Paintings of around 200 paintings. The collection is currently called the Royal Picture Gallery. The current collection consists of almost 800 paintings and focusses on Dutch and Flemish artists, such as Pieter Brueghel, Paulus Potter, Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt van Rijn, Jacob van Ruisdael, Johannes Vermeer, and Rogier van der Weyden. There are also works of Hans Holbein in the collection in the Mauritshuis.

== Administration ==

The Mauritshuis was a state museum until 1995, when it became an independent foundation. It still continues to receive funding from the Dutch central government. For its estimated budget for 2024, the government provided just under a third (5m Euros) of its total budget of 16m Euros. The Prince William V Gallery is also managed by the organisation.

The museum has a staff of around 91 people. Emilie Elise Saskia Gordenker was museum director from 2008 until 2020. Martine Gosselink assumed the directorship in February 2020. Victor Moussault served as deputy director from 2007 until 2016, succeeded by Sander Uitdenbogaard in 2017.

In the period 2005 to 2011, the Mauritshuis saw between 205,000 and 262,000 visitors per year. In 2011, the museum was the 13th most visited museum in the Netherlands. In 2012, when the museum closed for renovation on 1 April, it received 45,981 visitors. The museum was closed all of 2013 and was reopened on 27 June 2014. It closed for three months in the spring of 2020 in response to the Covid epidemic.

<text>A chief executive officer (CEO), also known as a &quot;chief executive&quot; or &quot;managing director&quot;, is the top-ranking corporate officer charged with the management of an organization, usually a company or a nonprofit organization.

CEOs find roles in various organizations, including public and private corporations, nonprofit organizations, and even some government organizations (notably state-owned enterprises). The governor and CEO of a corporation or company typically reports to the board of directors and is charged with maximizing the value of the business, which may include maximizing the profitability, market share, revenue, or another financial metric. In the nonprofit and government sector, CEOs typically aim at achieving outcomes related to the organization&#x27;s mission, usually provided by legislation. CEOs are also frequently assigned the role of the main manager of the organization and the highest-ranking officer in the C-suite.

==Origins==
The term &quot;chief executive officer&quot; is attested as early as 1782, when an ordinance of the Congress of the Confederation of the United States of America used the term to refer to governors and other leaders of the executive branches of each of the Thirteen Colonies. In draft additions to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; published online in 2011, the &quot;Dictionary&quot; says that the use of &quot;CEO&quot; as an acronym for a chief executive officer originated in Australia, with the first attestation being in 1914. The first American usage cited is from 1972.

==Responsibilities==
The responsibilities of an organization&#x27;s CEO are set by the organization&#x27;s board of directors or other authority, depending on the organization&#x27;s structure. They can be far-reaching or quite limited, and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority regarding business administration. Typically, responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on business strategy and other key policy issues, as well as leader, manager, and executor roles. The communicator role can involve speaking to the press and to the public, as well as to the organization&#x27;s management and employees; the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy. The CEO is tasked with implementing the goals, targets and strategic objectives as determined by the board of directors.

As an executive officer of the company, the CEO reports the status of the business to the board of directors, motivates employees, and drives change within the organization. As a manager, the CEO presides over the organization&#x27;s day-to-day operations. The CEO is the person who is ultimately accountable for a company&#x27;s business decisions, including those in operations, marketing, business development, finance, human resources, etc. The CEO of a political party is often entrusted with fundraising, particularly for election campaigns.

The use of the CEO title may be used by for-profit companies or non-profit or charitable organisations, such as the Wikimedia Foundation.

==International use==
In some countries, there is a dual board system with two separate boards, one executive board for the day-to-day business and one supervisory board for control purposes (selected by the shareholders). In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the chairperson presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board. This allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person.

In the United States, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee (the division/subsidiary heads and C-level officers that report directly to the CEO).

In the United States, and in business, the executive officers are usually the top officers of a corporation, the chief executive officer (CEO) being the best-known type. The definition varies; for instance, the California Corporate Disclosure Act defines &quot;executive officers&quot; as the five most highly compensated officers not also sitting on the board of directors. In the case of a sole proprietorship, an executive officer is the sole proprietor. In the case of a partnership, an executive officer is a managing partner, senior partner, or administrative partner. In the case of a limited liability company, an executive officer is any member, manager, or officer.

==Related positions==

Depending on the organization, a CEO may have several subordinate executives to help run the day-to-day administration of the company, each of whom has specific functional responsibilities referred to as senior executives, executive officers or corporate officers. Subordinate executives are given different titles in different organizations, but one common category of subordinate executive, if the CEO is also the president, is the vice president (VP). An organization may have more than one vice president, each tasked with a different area of responsibility (e.g., VP of finance, VP of human resources). Examples of subordinate executive officers who typically report to the CEO include the chief operating officer (COO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief strategy officer (CSO), chief marketing officer (CMO) and chief business officer (CBO). The public relations-focused position of chief reputation officer is sometimes included as one such subordinate executive officer, but, as suggested by Anthony Johndrow, CEO of Reputation Economy Advisors, it can also be seen as &quot;simply another way to add emphasis to the role of a modern-day CEO – where they are both the external face of, and the driving force behind, an organization culture&quot;.

===United States===
In the US, the term &quot;chief executive officer&quot; is used primarily in business, whereas the term &quot;executive director&quot; is used primarily in the not-for-profit sector. These terms are generally mutually exclusive and refer to distinct legal duties and responsibilities. The CEO is the highest-ranking executive in a company, making corporate decisions, managing operations, allocating resources, and serving as the main point of communication between the board of directors and the company.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, chief executive and chief executive officer are used in local government, where their position in law is described as the &quot;head of paid service&quot;, and in business and in the charitable sector. , the use of the term director for senior charity staff is deprecated to avoid confusion with the legal duties and responsibilities associated with being a charity director or trustee, which are normally non-executive (unpaid) roles. The term managing director is often used in lieu of chief executive officer.

==Celebrity CEOs==
Business publicists since the days of Edward Bernays (1891–1995) and his client John D. Rockefeller (1839–1937) and even more successfully the corporate publicists for Henry Ford, promoted the concept of the &quot;celebrity CEO&quot;. Business journalists have often adopted this approach, which assumes that the corporate achievements, especially in the arena of manufacturing, are produced by uniquely talented individuals, especially the &quot;heroic CEO&quot;. In effect, journalists celebrate a CEO who takes distinctive strategic actions. The model is the celebrity in entertainment, sports, and politics – compare the &quot;great man theory&quot;. Guthey &quot;et al.&quot; argues that &quot;...these individuals are not self-made, but rather are created by a process of widespread media exposure to the point that their actions, personalities, and even private lives function symbolically to represent significant dynamics and tensions prevalent in the contemporary business atmosphere&quot;. Journalism thereby exaggerates the importance of the CEO and tends to neglect harder-to-describe broader corporate factors. There is little attention to the intricately organized technical bureaucracy that actually does the work. Hubris sets in when the CEO internalizes the celebrity and becomes excessively self-confident in making complex decisions. There may be an emphasis on the sort of decisions that attract the celebrity journalists.

Research published in 2009 by Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate indicates that &quot;firms with award-winning CEOs subsequently underperform, in terms both of stock and of operating performance&quot;.

==Criticism==

===Executive compensation===

Executive compensation has been a source of criticism following a dramatic rise in pay relative to the average worker&#x27;s wage. For example, the relative pay was 20-to-1 in 1965 in the US, but had risen to 376-to-1 by 2000. The relative pay differs around the world, and, in some smaller countries, is still around 20-to-1. Observers differ as to whether the rise is due to competition for talent or due to lack of control by compensation committees. In recent years, investors have demanded more say over executive pay.

===Diversity===

Lack of diversity amongst chief executives has also been a source of criticism. In 2018, 5% of &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 CEOs were women. In 2023 the number rose to 10.4% of for Women CEO&#x27;s of Fortune 500 companies. The reasons for this are explained or justified in various ways, and may include biological sex differences, male and female differences in Big Five personality traits and temperament, sex differences in psychology and interests, maternity and career breaks, hypergamy, phallogocentrism, the existence of old boy networks, tradition, and the lack of female role models in that regard. Some countries have passed laws mandating boardroom gender quotas. In 2023 Rockefeller Foundation awarded a grant to Korn Ferry to research strategies and then action a plan to help more women to become CEO&#x27;s.

===Toxic executives===

There are contentious claims that a significant number of CEO&#x27;s have psychopathic tendencies, often characterized by power-seeking behavior and dominance. These individuals can often conceal their ruthlessness and antisocial behavior behind a facade of charm and eloquence. Traits such as courage and risk-taking, generally considered desirable, are often found alongside these psychopathic tendencies.

Tara Swart, a neuroscientist at MIT Sloan School of Management, has suggested that individuals with psychopathic traits thrive in chaotic environments and are aware that others do not. As a result, they may intentionally create chaos in the workplace. This perspective is explored in the book &quot;Snakes in Suits&quot;, co-authored by Robert D. Hare.

However, Scott Lilienfeld has argued that the attention given to psychopathy in the workplace by both the media and scholars has far exceeded the available scientific evidence. Emilia Bunea, writing in &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, has linked psychopathic traits in managers to workplace bullying, employee dissatisfaction, and turnover intentions. Despite this, Bunea cautions that excessive worry about supposed psychopathic managers could discourage individuals from pursuing careers in corporations and deter employees from addressing issues with difficult bosses.

<doc id="52239" wikidata="Q190084" url="?curid=52239" title="Hoax">
<text>A hoax (plural: hoaxes) is a widely publicised falsehood created to deceive its audience with false and often astonishing information, with the either malicious or humorous intent of causing shock and interest in as many people as possible.

Some hoaxers intend to eventually unmask their representations as having been a hoax so as to expose their victims as fools; seeking some form of profit, other hoaxers hope to maintain the hoax indefinitely, so that it is only when skeptical people willing to investigate their claims publish their findings, that the hoaxers are finally revealed as such.

==History==
Zhang Yingyu&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Swindles&quot; ( 1617), published during the late Ming dynasty, is said to be China&#x27;s first collection of stories about fraud, swindles, hoaxes, and other forms of deception. Although practical jokes have likely existed for thousands of years, one of the earliest recorded hoaxes in Western history was the drummer of Tedworth in 1661. The communication of hoaxes can be accomplished in almost any manner that a fictional story can be communicated: in person, via word of mouth, via words printed on paper, and so on. As communications technology has advanced, the speed at which hoaxes spread has also advanced: a rumour about a ghostly drummer, spread by word of mouth, will affect a relatively small area at first, then grow gradually. However, hoaxes could also be spread via chain letters, which became easier as the cost of mailing a letter dropped. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century brought down the cost of a mass-produced books and pamphlets, and the rotary printing press of the 19th century reduced the price even further (see yellow journalism). During the 20th century, the hoax found a mass market in the form of supermarket tabloids, and by the 21st century there were fake news websites which spread hoaxes via social networking websites (in addition to the use of email for a modern type of chain letter).

==Etymology==
The English philologist Robert Nares (1753–1829) says that the word &quot;hoax&quot; was coined in the late 18th century as a contraction of the verb &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;to cheat&quot;, &quot;to impose upon&quot; or (according to Merriam-Webster) &quot;to befuddle often with drugged liquor.&quot; &quot;Hocus&quot; is a shortening of the magic incantation &quot;hocus pocus&quot;, whose origin is disputed.

==Definition==
Robert Nares defined the word &quot;hoax&quot; as meaning &quot;to cheat&quot;, dating from Thomas Ady&#x27;s 1656 book &quot;A candle in the dark, or a treatise on the nature of witches and witchcraft&quot;.

The term &quot;hoax&quot; is occasionally used in reference to urban legends and rumours, but the folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand argues that most of them lack evidence of deliberate creations of falsehood and are passed along in good faith by believers or as jokes, so the term should be used for only those with a probable conscious attempt to deceive. As for the closely related terms &quot;practical joke&quot; and &quot;prank&quot;, Brunvand states that although there are instances where they overlap, &quot;hoax&quot; tends to indicate &quot;relatively complex and large-scale fabrications&quot; and includes deceptions that go beyond the merely playful and &quot;cause material loss or harm to the victim.&quot;

According to Professor Lynda Walsh of the University of Nevada, Reno, some hoaxessuch as the Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814, labelled as a hoax by contemporary commentatorsare financial in nature, and successful hoaxerssuch as P. T. Barnum, whose Fiji mermaid contributed to his wealthoften acquire monetary gain or fame through their fabrications, so the distinction between &quot;hoax&quot; and &quot;fraud&quot; is not necessarily clear. Alex Boese, the creator of the Museum of Hoaxes, states that the only distinction between them is the reaction of the public, because a fraud can be classified as a hoax when its method of acquiring financial gain creates a broad public impact or captures the imagination of the masses.

One of the earliest recorded media hoaxes is a fake almanac published by Jonathan Swift under the pseudonym of Isaac Bickerstaff in 1708. Swift predicted the death of John Partridge, one of the leading astrologers in England at that time, in the almanac and later issued an elegy on the day Partridge was supposed to have died. Partridge&#x27;s reputation was damaged as a result and his astrological almanac was not published for the next six years.

It is possible to perpetrate a hoax by making only true statements using unfamiliar wording or context, such as in the Dihydrogen monoxide hoax. Political hoaxes are sometimes motivated by the desire to ridicule or besmirch opposing politicians or political institutions, often before elections.

A hoax differs from a magic trick or from fiction (books, film, theatre, radio, television, etc.) in that the audience is unaware of being deceived, whereas in watching a magician perform an illusion the audience expects to be tricked.

A hoax is often intended as a practical joke or to cause embarrassment, or to provoke social or political change by raising people&#x27;s awareness of something. It can also emerge from a marketing or advertising purpose. For example, to market a romantic comedy film, a director staged a phony &quot;incident&quot; during a supposed wedding, which showed a bride and preacher getting knocked into a pool by a clumsy fall from a best man. A resulting video clip of &quot;Chloe and Keith&#x27;s Wedding&quot; was uploaded to YouTube and was viewed by over 30 million people and the couple was interviewed by numerous talk shows. Viewers were deluded into thinking that it was an authentic clip of a real accident at a real wedding; but a story in &quot;USA Today&quot; in 2009 revealed it was a hoax.

Governments sometimes spread false information to facilitate their objectives, such as going to war. These often come under the heading of black propaganda. There is often a mixture of outright hoax and suppression and management of information to give the desired impression. In wartime and times of international tension rumours abound, some of which may be deliberate hoaxes.

Examples of politics-related hoaxes:
* Belgium is a country with a Flemish-speaking region and a French-speaking region. In 2006, French-speaking television channel RTBF interrupted programming with a spoof report claiming that the country had split in two and the royal family had fled.
* On 13 March 2010, the Imedi television station in Georgia broadcast a false announcement that Russia had invaded Georgia.

Psychologist Peter Hancock has identified six steps which characterise a truly successful hoax:
* Identify a constituencya person or group of people who, for reasons such as piety or patriotism, or greed, will truly care about your creation.
* Identify a particular dream which will make your hoax appeal to your constituency.
* Create an appealing but &quot;under-specified&quot; hoax, with ambiguities
* Have your creation discovered.
* Find at least one champion who will actively support your hoax.
* Make people care, either positively or negativelythe ambiguities encourage interest and debate

==Types==
Hoaxes vary widely in their processes of creation, propagation, and entrenchment over time. Examples include:
* Academic hoaxes:
** The Sokal affair
** The Grievance studies affair
* Art-world hoaxes:
** The &quot;Bruno Hat&quot; art hoax, arranged in London in July 1929, involved staging a convincing public exhibition of paintings by an imaginary reclusive artist, Bruno Hat. All the perpetrators were well-educated and did not intend a fraud, as the newspapers were informed the next day. Those involved included Brian Howard, Evelyn Waugh, Bryan Guinness, John Banting and Tom Mitford
** &quot;Nat Tate: An American Artist 1928-1960&quot;: a 1998 art world hoax, by William Boyd
** Disumbrationism: a modern art hoax
** Pierre Brassau: exposing art critics to &quot;modern paintings&quot; made by a chimpanzee
** Ads for Jean Freeman Gallery appeared in &quot;Art in America&quot; in 1970, but the art gallery and its address did not exist. It turned out to be a performance art hoax later covered in news outlets &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Today&quot;
** &quot;Spectra: A Book of Poetic Experiments&quot;: a modernist poetry hoax
** Ern Malley, the popular but fictitious Australian poet
* Apocryphal claims that originate as a hoax gain widespread belief among members of a culture or organisation, become entrenched as persons who believe it repeat it in good faith to others, and continue to command that belief after the hoax&#x27;s originators have died or departed
* Computer virus hoaxes became widespread as viruses themselves began to spread. A typical hoax is an email message warning recipients of a non-existent threat, usually forging quotes supposedly from authorities such as Microsoft and IBM. In most cases the payload is an exhortation to distribute the message to everyone in the recipient&#x27;s address book. Thus the e-mail &quot;warning&quot; is itself the &quot;virus.&quot; Sometimes the hoax is more harmful, e.g., telling the recipient to seek a particular file (usually in a Microsoft Windows operating system); if the file is found, the computer is deemed to be infected unless it is deleted. In reality the file is one required by the operating system for correct functioning of the computer.
* Criminal hoax admissions, such as the case of John Samuel Humble, also known as Wearside Jack. Criminal hoax admissions divert time and money of police investigations with communications purporting to come from the actual criminal. Once caught, hoaxers are charged under criminal codes such as perverting the course of justice and wasting police time.
* Factoids
* Hoaxes formed by making minor or gradually increasing changes to a warning or other claims widely circulated for legitimate purposes
* Hoax of exposure is a semi-comical or private sting operation. It usually encourages people to act foolishly or credulously by falling for patent nonsense that the hoaxer deliberately presents as reality. A related activity is culture jamming.
* Hoax news
* Hoaxes perpetrated by &quot;scare tactics&quot; appealing to the audience&#x27;s subjectively rational belief that the expected cost of not believing the hoax (the cost if its assertions are true times the likelihood of their truth) outweighs the expected cost of believing the hoax (cost if false times likelihood of falsity), such as claims that a non-malicious but unfamiliar program on one&#x27;s computer is malware
* Hoaxes perpetrated on occasions when their initiation is considered socially appropriate, such as April Fools&#x27; Day
* Humbugs
* Internet hoaxes became more common after the start of social media. Some websites have been used to hoax millions of people on the Web
* Paleoanthropological hoaxes, anthropologists were taken in by the &quot;Piltdown Man discovery&quot; that was widely believed from 1913 to 1953
* Protest hoaxes. Members of social movements and other political activists have often used hoaxes in order to draw attention to causes and undermine their opponents.
* Religious hoaxes
* UFO hoaxes
* Urban legends and rumours with a probable conscious attempt to deceive

==Hoax news==

Hoax news (also referred to as fake news) is a news report containing facts that are either inaccurate or false but which are presented as genuine. A hoax news report conveys a half-truth used deliberately to mislead the public.

Hoax may serve the goal of propaganda or disinformation – using social media to drive web traffic and amplify their effect. Unlike news satire, fake news websites seek to mislead, rather than entertain, readers for financial or political gain.

Hoax news is usually released with the intention of misleading to injure an organisation, individual, or person, and/or benefit financially or politically, sometimes utilising sensationalist, deceptive, or simply invented headlines to maximise readership. Likewise, clickbait reports and articles from this operation gain advertisement revenue.

<text>Autosport is a global motorsport publishing brand headquartered based in Richmond, London, England. It was established in 1950 at the same time as the origins of the Formula One World Championship.

Autosport began life as a weekly magazine in 1950 and expanded into digital publishing with the creation of Autosport.com in 1997. In 2016, Haymarket Media Group sold Autosport and the rest of its motorsport portfolio to Motorsport Network.

==Autosport.com==
Autosport launched its website – Autosport.com – in 1997. As distinct from the magazine, the online content is more internationally focussed and as well as covering sports news and reporting on races, Autosport.com also produces video and galleries taken from the Motorsport Images archive and in-depth long-form content in the website&#x27;s subscriber-only sections.

===Autosport Plus===
Autosport Plus is a paywalled part of the autosport.com website with additional content.

==Autosport Magazine==
Autosport first issue was published in 1950 and the weekly newsstand title has been in continuous publication ever since.

It covers all forms of motorsport from Formula 1 through to the British club racing scene. The magazine carries race and rally reports from high-profile and significant meetings from all over the world and the UK and blends this with news analysis and in-depth articles looking at contemporary cars, drivers and events as well as retrospective looks at significant characters and developments from the sport&#x27;s past.

Traditionally Autosport had only focused on four-wheel racing, but its editorial expanded to include MotoGP coverage in 2014. In the past, the magazine once carried reviews of new road cars, but it is now specifically dedicated to racing and rallying.

Autosport stopped printing their magazine on 30 April 2020 due to COVID, and said that they would resume in time for the 2020 Formula 1 season. They then resumed publishing with the issue dated 3 July 2020.

Autosport switched from a weekly to a monthly publication at the beginning of 2025, after it was merged with its sister title &quot;GP Racing&quot;.

===Current editorial team===

Since May 2016 the magazine has been edited by Kevin Turner, who was previously the editor of sister title Motorsport News. The other full-time members of staff are.

*Chief Editor - Kevin Turner 
*Deputy editor - Marcus Simmons
*Grand Prix editor - Alex Kalinauckas 
*F1 Editor - Matt Kew
*F1 Reporter - Luke Smith
*Technical Editor - Jake Boxall-Legge
*Production Editor - Peter Hodges
*Group National Editor - Stephen Lickorish
*Performance and Engineering Editor - James Newbold
*Deputy National Editor - Stefan Mackley
*Art Director - Lynsey Elliott
*Art Editor - Michael Cavalli

In addition, the magazine features a number of freelance correspondents. Among these are F1 columnist Nigel Roebuck, Sportscar specialist Gary Watkins and British Club racing expert Marcus Pye. It also has correspondents covering club-level racing from the British domestic racing scene and prominent international races and rallies.

===Editions===
Autosport Asia Edition

In April 2011, Autosport re-launched Autosport Asia Edition. It is published by Bespoke Media Pte Ltd in Singapore. It is a monthly magazine instead of a weekly and the aim is that it will carry over most of the month&#x27;s content from the British edition, as well as placing a very strong emphasis on the Asian motorsport scene.

Autosport Russian Edition

On 11 February 2013, launched Autosport Russian Edition.

Autosport Arabic Edition

On 1 November 2013, launched Autosport Arabic Edition.

Autosport French Edition

On 3 April 2014, launched Autosport French Edition.

==Autosport Engineering &amp; Autosport Performance==

Autosport Engineering and Autosport Performance are regular supplements that appear in Autosport each month on a rotating basis. Edited by James Newbold, Autosport Engineering is derived from the section of the Autosport International Show of the same name.

The supplement has a particular focus on companies based in the UK.

==Autosport International==

Autosport International is a motorsport-themed exhibition, which has taken place every January at the NEC Birmingham, UK, since 1991.

==Autosport Awards==

The Autosport Awards, held annually at The Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane in London on the first weekend in December is motorsport&#x27;s red carpet event, honouring the achievements of the race drivers from Formula One and other world championships, as well as recognising and promoting emerging talent.
