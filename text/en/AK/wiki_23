<text>Orange juice is a liquid extract of the orange tree fruit, produced by squeezing or reaming oranges. It comes in several different varieties, including blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, clementine, and tangerine. As well as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing amounts of juice vesicles, known as &quot;pulp&quot; in American English, and &quot;(juicy) bits&quot; in British English. These vesicles contain the juice of the orange and can be left in or removed during the manufacturing process. How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season. In American English, the beverage name is often abbreviated as &quot;OJ&quot;.

Commercial orange juice with a long shelf life is made by pasteurizing the juice and removing the oxygen from it. This removes much of the taste, necessitating the later addition of a flavor pack, generally made from orange products. Additionally, some juice is further processed by drying and later rehydrating the juice, or by concentrating the juice and later adding water to the concentrate.

The health value of orange juice is debatable: it has a high concentration of vitamin C, but also a very high concentration of simple sugars, comparable to soft drinks. As a result, some government nutritional advice has been adjusted to encourage substitution of orange juice with raw fruit, which is digested more slowly, and limit daily consumption.

==History==
During World War II, American soldiers rejected vitamin C-packed lemon crystals because of their unappetizing taste. Thus the US government searched for a food that would fulfill the nutritional needs of the soldiers, have a desirable taste, and prevent diseases such as scurvy. The US federal government and the Florida Department of Citrus worked with a group of scientists to develop a product superior to the canned orange juice available in the 1940s. The result was frozen concentrated orange juice; this was not until three years after the war had ended.

By 1949, orange juice processing plants in Florida were producing over 10 million gallons of concentrated orange juice. Consumers liked concentrated canned orange juice as it was affordable, tasty, convenient, and high in vitamin C. The preparation was simple: empty the container of frozen concentrate into a measured volume of water and stir. However, by the 1980s, food scientists developed a fresher-tasting juice known as reconstituted ready-to-serve juice. Eventually in the 1990s, &quot;not from concentrate&quot; (NFC) orange juice was developed. Orange juice is a common breakfast beverage in the United States.

Due to the importance of oranges to the economy of Florida, &quot;the juice obtained from mature oranges of the species &quot;Citrus sinensis&quot; and hybrids thereof&quot; was adopted as the official beverage of Florida in 1967.

==Nutrition==

A cup serving (250 millilitres or 8 ounces) of fresh orange juice is 88% water and contains 26 grams of carbohydrates (including 21 grams of sugar), two grams of protein, and 0.5 grams each of dietary fiber and fat (table). One cup supplies 112 calories and 149% of the Daily Value (DV) of vitamin C, with moderate amounts (11-19% DV) of potassium, thiamin, and folate (table).

Because of its citric acid content, orange juice is acidic, with a typical pH of around 3.5.

As of 2020, consumption of orange juice was under preliminary research for the potential to improve nutrition and affect cardiovascular diseases.

==Commercial orange juice and concentrate==
===Frozen concentrated orange juice===
Commercial squeezed orange juice is pasteurized and filtered before being evaporated under vacuum and heat. After removal of most of the water, this concentrate, about 65% sugar by weight, is then stored at about . Essences, Vitamin C, and oils extracted during the vacuum concentration process may be added back to restore flavor and nutrition (see below).

When water is added to freshly thawed concentrated orange juice, it is said to be &quot;reconstituted&quot;.

The product was developed in 1948 at the University of Florida&#x27;s Citrus Research and Education Center. Since, it has emerged as a soft commodity, and futures contracts have traded in New York since 1966. Options on FCOJ were introduced in 1985. From the late 1950s to the mid-1980s, the product had the greatest orange juice market share, but not-from-concentrate juices surpassed FCOJ in the 1980s.

===Not from concentrate===
Orange juice that is pasteurized and then sold to consumers without having been concentrated is labeled as &quot;not from concentrate&quot;. Just as &quot;from concentrate&quot; processing, most &quot;not from concentrate&quot; processing reduces the natural flavor from the juice. The largest producers of &quot;not from concentrate&quot; use a production process where the juice is placed in aseptic storage, with the oxygen stripped from it, for up to a year.

Removing the oxygen also strips out flavor-providing compounds, and so manufacturers add a flavor pack in the final step, which &quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot; magazine describes as containing &quot;highly engineered additives.&quot; Flavor pack formulas vary by region, because consumers in different parts of the world have different preferences related to sweetness, freshness and acidity. According to the citrus industry, the Food and Drug Administration does not require the contents of flavor packs to be detailed on a product&#x27;s packaging.

One common component of flavor packs is ethyl butyrate, a natural aroma that people associate with freshness, and which is removed from juice during pasteurization and storage. &quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot; sent juice samples to independent laboratories, and found that while fresh-squeezed juice naturally contained about 1.19 milligrams of ethyl butyrate per liter, juice that had been commercially processed had levels as high as 8.53 milligrams per liter.

===Canned orange juice===
A small fraction of fresh orange juice is canned. Canned orange juice retains vitamin C much better than bottled juice. The canned product loses flavor, however, when stored at room temperature for more than 12 weeks. In the early years of canned orange juice, the acidity of the juice caused the juice to have a metallic taste. In 1931, Dr. Philip Phillips developed a flash pasteurization process that eliminated this problem and significantly increased the market for canned orange juice.

===Freshly squeezed, unpasteurized juice===

Fresh-squeezed, the unpasteurized juice is the closest to consuming the orange itself. This version of the juice consists of oranges that are squeezed and then bottled without having any additives or flavor packs inserted. The juice is not subjected to pasteurization. Depending on storage temperature, freshly squeezed, unpasteurized orange juice can have a shelf life of 5 to 23 days.

===Major orange juice brands===
In the U.S., the major orange juice brand is Tropicana Products (owned by PAI Partners and PepsiCo Inc.), which possesses nearly 65% of the market share. Tropicana also has a large presence in Latin America, Europe, and Central Asia. Competing products include Minute Maid (of The Coca-Cola Company) and Florida&#x27;s Natural Growers (a Floridian agricultural cooperative that differentiates itself from the competition by being locally owned and using only Florida grown oranges; Tropicana and Simply Orange use a mixture of domestic and foreign stock).

In Australia, Daily Juice (owned by National Foods) is a major brand of partially fresh, partially preserved, orange juice.

In the United Kingdom, major orange juice brands include Del Monte and Princes.

===Additives===
Some producers add citric acid or ascorbic acid to juice beyond what is naturally found in the orange. Some also include other nutrients. Often, additional vitamin C is added to replace that destroyed in pasteurization. Additional calcium may be added. Vitamin D, not found naturally in oranges, may be added as well. Sometimes omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils are added to orange juice. Low-acid varieties of orange juice also are available.

FCOJ producers generally use evaporators to remove much of the water from the juice in order to decrease its weight and decrease transportation costs. Other juice producers generally deaerate the juice so that it can be sold much later in the year.

Because such processes remove the distinct aroma compounds that give orange juice a fresh-squeezed taste, producers later add back these compounds in a proprietary mixture, called a &quot;flavor pack&quot;, in order to improve the taste and to ensure a consistent year-round taste. The compounds in the flavor packs are derived from orange peels by squeezing the oil out of them. Producers do not mention the addition of flavor packs on the label of the orange juice.

===Types of orange===
Common orange juice is made from the sweet orange. Different cultivars (for example, Valencia, Hamlin) have different properties, and a producer may mix cultivar juices to get the desired taste. Orange juice usually varies between shades of orange and yellow, although some ruby red or blood orange varieties are a reddish-orange or even pinkish. This is due to different pigmentation in ruby red oranges.

The blood orange is a mutant of the sweet orange. The mandarin orange and the clementine and tangerine varieties are often used for sparkling juice drinks.

Many brands of organic orange juices have become available on the market.

==Processing and manufacture==
===Manufacture of frozen concentrated orange juice===

The processing of orange to frozen concentrated orange juice begins with testing the orange fruit for quality to ensure it is safe for the process. Then the fruit is cleaned and washed thoroughly and orange oil is taken from the peel of the orange. Next, the juice is extracted from the orange and is screened in order to remove seeds and large pieces of pulp. The juice is then heated to 190 to 200 °F in order to inactivate natural enzymes found in the juice. The concentration step occurs in a high vacuum evaporator where the water content in the juice is evaporated while the juice sugar compounds and solids are concentrated. The vacuum evaporator is a low temperature falling film evaporator, which operates at a temperature between 60 and 80 °F. Evaporators work in a continuous manner in that fresh juice is added as concentrate is being constantly removed. The concentration process increases the soluble solid portion of the juice from 12 °Brix to 60-70 °Brix.

The concentrated juice is held in a cold wall tank and is stored at or below 35 °F to prevent browning and development of undesired flavors. Next, a small amount of fresh juice is added to the concentrated juice to restore natural and fresh flavors of orange juice that have been lost through the concentration process. Specific cold-pressed orange oils are used to restore the lost aroma and volatile flavors. After the addition of fresh juice, the brix content is reduced to 42 °F. The fresh juice is referred to as &quot;cut-back&quot; in the industry and attributes to 7-10% of the total juice. Orange peel oil is also added if the oil content is below the required level. The concentrate is then further cooled in a continuous cooler or cold wall tank to 20 to 25 °F. The concentrate is canned using steam injection methods to sterilize the lid and develop a vacuum in the can. The cans then undergo final freezing where they are conveyed on a perforated belt in an air blast at -40 °F. After freezing, the product is stored at 0 °F in a refrigerated warehouse.

===Manufacture of &quot;not from concentrate&quot;===
Single strength orange juice (SSOJ) can either be &quot;not from concentrate&quot; (NFC) orange juice or juice that is reconstituted from a concentrate with the addition of water to reach a specific single strength brix level. The processing of SSOJ also begins with the selection of orange. The most common types of orange used to produce orange juice are the Pineapple orange, Valencia orange, and Washington Navel oranges from Florida and California. The manufacturing journey begins when oranges are delivered to processing plants by trucks holding about 35,000 to 40,000 pounds of fruit. The fruit is unloaded at the plant for inspection and grading to remove unsuitable fruit before the oranges enter the storage bins. An automatic sampler removes oranges for determination of acid and soluble solids. The bins are organized based on ratio of soluble solids to acids in order to blend oranges appropriate to produce juice with uniform flavor. After the fruit leaves the bins, they are scrubbed with detergent on a rotary brush washer and subsequently rinsed with potable water. Throughout the processing stages, there are multiple points with facilities that inspect oranges and discard damaged fruit.

The oranges then go through roller conveyors, which expose all sides of the fruit. The roller conveyors are efficiently built as they are well lighted, installed at a convenient height, and width to ensure all inspectors can reach the fruit to determine inadequacies. Some reasons why fruit may be rejected include indication of mold, rot, and ruptured peels. Afterwards, the oranges are separated based on size through machines prior to juice extraction. There are a number of different ways orange juice industry leaders extract their oranges. Some common methods include halving the fruit and pressing/reaming the orange to extract juice from the orange. One instrument inserts a tube through the orange peel and forces the juice out through the tube by squeezing the entire orange. Despite the variety of machines used to extract juices, all machines have commonalities in that they are rugged, fast, easy to clean and have the ability to reduce peel extractives into the juice. The extracted juice product does not contain the orange peel, but it may contain pulp and seeds, which are removed by finishers.

Finishers have a screw-type design that comprises a conical helical screw enclosed in a cylindrical screen with perforations the size of 0.020 to 0.045 inches. Thereafter, the finished orange juice flows through blending tanks where the juice is tested for acid and soluble solids. At this stage, sugar can be added to the juice depending on if the product will be a sweetened or unsweetened beverage. Following blending, the orange juice is deaerated where the air is incorporated into the juice during extraction. The benefits of deaeration include the elimination of foaming, which improves the uniformity of can fill and improvement regarding the efficiency of the heat exchanger. Orange peel oil is essential for maximum flavor, but according to U.S. standards for Grades of Canned Orange Juice, 0.03% of recoverable oil is permitted. Deoiling through the use of vacuum distillation is the mechanism used to regulate the amount of peel oil in the juice. Condensation separates the oil and the aqueous distillate, which is returned to the juice.

The next step is one of the most vital in the processing of orange juice. Pasteurization is important in destroying naturally occurring enzymes that are associated with deterioration of the juice. Pectinesterase is infamous for its deteriorative activity in orange juice. In the pasteurization process, the juice is generally rapidly heated to 197 °F for about 40 seconds. Several industry leaders use flash pasteurization, which is carried out by tubular or plate-type heat exchangers. In order to prevent overheating, turbulent flow is vital to heat the juice rapidly. Cans are filled with the pasteurized juice and inverted immediately to allow the juice to sterilize the inside parts of the lid. The orange juice filled can is sealed and cooled to 90 to 100 °F by spinning on the conveyor belt under cool water sprays. Quality of storage is determined by time and temperature. Juice must be stored at cool temperatures to prevent deterioration.

==Standards and regulations==
===Regulations in Canada===
For Canadian markets, orange juice must be the fruit juice obtained from clean, sound, and mature oranges. The juice must also contain a minimum of 1.20 milliequivalents of free amino acids per 100 millilitres, contain a minimum of 115 milligrams of potassium per 10 milliliters, and possess a minimum absorbance value for total polyphenolics of 0.380. Sweeteners such as sugar, invert sugar, dextrose or glucose solids may be added. The orange juice must have a Brix reading of at least 9.7, excluding the sweetening ingredients, and contain between 0.5 and 1.8 percent of acid by weight calculated as anhydrous citric acid. Added orange essences, orange oils and orange pulp adjusted in accordance with good manufacturing practice is permitted. Orange juice is also permitted to contain sugar, invert sugar, dextrose in dry form, glucose solids, a Class II preservative, amylase, cellulase and pectinase.

===Regulations in the United States===
In the United States, orange juice is regulated and standardized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. According to the FDA, orange juice from concentrate is a mixture of water with frozen concentrated orange juice or concentrated orange juice for manufacturing. Additional ingredients into the mixture may include fresh/frozen/pasteurized orange juice from mature oranges, orange oil, and orange pulp. Furthermore, one or more of the following optional sweetening ingredients may be added: sugar, sugar syrup, invert sugar, invert sugar syrup, dextrose, corn syrup, dried corn syrup, glucose syrup, and dried glucose syrup. The orange juice must contain a minimum Brix level of 11.8, which indicates the percentage of orange juice soluble solids, excluding any added sweetening ingredients.

===Regulations in the United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, orange juice from concentrate is a product of concentrated fruit juice with the addition of water. Any lost flavour or pulp of the orange juice during the initial concentration process may be restored in the final product to be equivalent to an average type of orange juice of the same kind. Any restored flavour or pulp must come from the same species of orange. Sugar may be added to the orange juice for regulating the acidic taste or sweetening, but must not exceed 150g per litre of orange juice. Across the UK, the final orange juice from concentrate product must contain a minimum Brix level of 11.2, excluding the additional sweetening ingredients. Vitamins and minerals may be added to the orange juice in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1925/2006.

==Physical and chemical properties==
===Molecular composition===
On a molecular level, orange juice is composed of organic acids, sugars, and phenolic compounds. The main organic acids found in orange juice are citric, malic, and ascorbic acid. The major sugars found in orange juice are sucrose, glucose, and fructose. There are approximately 13 phenolic compounds in orange juice including hydroxycinnamic acids, flavanones, hydroxybenzoic acids, hesperidin, narirutin, and ferulic acid.

====Composition of the cloud====
The cloud is the portion of suspended particles that range in size from 0.05 micrometers to a few hundred micrometers in orange juice. The cloud is responsible for several sensory attributes in orange juice including color, aroma, texture, and taste. The continuous medium of the cloud consists of a solution of sugars, pectin, and organic acids while the dispersed matter is formed through cellular tissue comminuted in fruit processing. Specifically, the cloudiness of the juice is caused by pectin, protein, lipid, hemicellulose, cellulose, hesperidin, chromoplastids, amorphous particles, and oil globules. In particular the chemical composition of the cloud consists of 4.5-32% pectin, 34-52% protein, 25% lipids, 5.7% nitrogen, 2% hemicellulose, 2% ash, and less than 2% cellulose.

=== Physical structure ===
Orange juice is a suspension that consists of heterogeneous particles in a clear serum. A serum is the clear supernatant after the precipitation of the cloud through centrifugation. The previously mentioned cloud makes up a large part of the suspension.

If the suspension in orange juice is not stable, the cloud particles can flocculate which causes the suspension to physically decompose. The cloud can break apart and the citrus juice will clarify if the suspension becomes unstable. The activity of pectin methyl esterase increased the interaction between pectin and cloud proteins, which led to protein-pectin flocculation. The insoluble material of the cloud clumps in conditions above and at a pH of 3-4 at which proteins coagulate and flocculate. Cloud flocculation is enhanced at pH 3.5 and can result in clarification, which is undesirable in orange juice.

The suspension is unstable when the zeta potential is less than 25 mv in magnitude. Zeta potential is a measure of the magnitude of electrostatic forces between particles, which affect repulsion, and attraction between particles. A low zeta value signifies that the repulsive forces will not be able to overcome Van der Waals attractions between cloud particles and thus begin to agglomerate. Agglomeration of cloud particles will prevent free flow characteristics, which is essential in the juice. A high zeta potential will inhibit particle-particle agglomeration and maintain the free flowing nature as well as uniform dispersion in orange juice.

The oil globules adsorbed to the cloud particles stabilize the suspension by decreasing the average density of particles to bring it closer to that of the serum. However, large amounts of oil can be problematic as they cause complete breakdown of suspensions by causing cloud particles to float to the surface. The particles in the cloud have a negative charge that decreases with decreasing pH. In accordance with cloud stability, the hydration of particles is more significant than their electrical charge.

==== Heat treatment ====
When orange juice is heat treated there is an increase in the number of fine particles and decrease in that of coarse particles. The fine particles in particular are responsible for the appearance, color, and flavor of orange juice. Heat treatment plays a vital role on pulp volume, cloud stability, serum turbidity, and serum viscosity. Heat treatment stabilizes the cloud through enzyme inactivation and enhances the turbidity of a stable cloud formation. The increase in serum viscosity is due to the extraction of pectic substances into the serum. Based on Stokes&#x27; law, the increase in serum viscosity is the cause for the enhanced cloud stability. In relation to pulp volume, the pulp from heated juices was finer and more compact than unheated juice pulp, which was voluminous and fluffy.

==== Properties of pulp ====
In orange juice, pulp is responsible for desirable flow properties, taste, flavor, and mouth feel. However, pulpy orange juice precipitates based on a rate dependent on the diameter, density, and viscosity of the suspended particles as well as the suspending juice. In order to remain suspended in orange juice, pulp particles must have appropriate particle size, charge, and specific gravity. Depending on type of processing method, the size of pulp particles ranges from . Those that are smaller than are known to be more stable, so it is beneficial to reduce the size of particles by incorporating hydrocolloids to the juice product. Hydrocolloids would decrease the rate of sediment formation and decrease the falling rate of pulp particles.

==== Hydrocolloids ====
Hydrocolloids are long-chain polymers that form viscous dispersions and gels if dispersed in water. They have a number of functional properties in food products including emulsifying, thickening, coating, gelling, and stabilization. The main reason hydrocolloids are used in foods is their capability to modify the rheology of food systems. Hydrocolloids impact viscosity through flow behavior and mechanical solid properties like texture. Some common hydrocolloids that are used to stabilize juice products include gellan gum, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan, guar gum, and gum Arabic. The aforementioned hydrocolloids are generally used in the production of imitation orange juices and are often referred to as synthetic hydrocolloids. Pectin is the hydrocolloid found in natural orange juices.

==== Properties of pectin ====

Pectin is the soluble polymeric material in the pulp of oranges, which contains 75% of carboxyl of arabinose and galactose. Pectic compounds are complex heteropolysaccharides in that their chemical composition includes a chain structure of axial-axial α-1.4-linked d-galacturonic acid unit along with blocks of L-rhamnose regions that have side chains of arabinose, galactose, and xylose. Pectin methyl-esterase is the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing carboxymethyl esters and liberating free carboxyl groups and methyl alcohols. The free carboxyl groups interact with cations to form insoluble pectic acid divalent metal ion complexes. These metal ion complexes precipitate in the juice and carry all the colloids in orange juice with it. The enzyme would flocculate the cloud and clarify the orange juice. Thus, in order to keep the orange juice cloud intact, it is vital to inactivate pectinesterase. Pectinesterase is inactivated by heating the juice for 1 minute at .

==== Interactions of pectin ====
The solution behavior of pectin is strongly influenced by a number of factors including hydrogen bonding, ionic character, and hydrophobic character. Hydrogen bonding is favored when pH is less than pKa while the ionic character is favored when pH is greater than pKa. Ionic character relies on free carboxyl content, the presence of cations, and is favored at a high water activity. Charge-charge repulsions along with the presence of neutral side chains are essential in inhibiting intermolecular association among pectin molecules. The methyl ester content in orange juice determines hydrophobic character, which is favored at low water activity.

There is a specific interaction between pectin and hesperidin through the sugar moieties in the hesperidin molecule. Through acid hydrolysis, the rhamnose and glucose sugar moieties are removed from hesperidin, which breaks the interaction between hesperidin and pectin. Hydrogen bonding plays a role in the specific interaction of neutral sugars of pectin and the sugar moiety of hesperidin. A polymer that has a high structural content of neutral sugar branches interacts with hesperidin more tightly and strongly than that of a low content of neutral sugar branches. The interaction between pectin and hesperidin is one of the factors that enable the colloidal suspension in orange juice to be stable.

==Consumption==
According to industry data, U.S. orange juice consumption has been steadily decreasing. In the 2008-2009 crop year, Americans consumed approximately 865,000 metric tons of orange juice. By the 2022-2023 crop year, this figure had fallen to around 500,000 metric tons, representing an average annual decline of approximately 4%. Factors contributing to this decline include rising prices for orange juice and adverse weather conditions affecting orange harvests.

<text>Fountain Valley is a suburban city in Orange County, California. The population was 57,047 at the 2020 census.

== History ==


=== Indigenous ===
The Indigenous people of the Fountain Valley area are the Tongva. The closest village to present-day site of the city was the village of Pasbenga. The village was part of a series of villages along what the Spanish would refer to as the Santa Ana River.

=== Spanish ===
European settlement of the area began when Manuel Nieto was granted the land for Rancho Los Nietos, later Rancho Las Bolsas, which encompassed over , including present-day Fountain Valley. Control of the land was subsequently transferred to Mexico upon independence from Spain, and then to the United States as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

===Talbert===
Talbert was a settlement at what is now the intersection of Talbert and Bushard. It was also known as Gospel Swamp by residents.

Thomas B. Talbert was born outside Monticello in Piatt County, Illinois, in 1878. When Talbert was 13, his family moved to Long Beach, California. Around 1896, the family purchased more than of peat and swampland in what is now Fountain Valley. The Talberts opened a general store and thus the settlement of Talbert was established.

The area was full of farms growing beets that were processed at some of the nation&#x27;s largest plants at Huntington Beach (Holly Sugar Plant) and at Delhi, now part of southwestern Santa Ana. The post office was established in 1899, with Thomas B. Talbert serving as the first postmaster.

The All-Saints Church is the only structure remaining from that era. The Santa Ana–Huntington Beach Line of the Pacific Electric Railway passed through Talbert and opened on July 5, 1909.

===Incorporation===
The city was incorporated in 1957. The name of Fountain Valley refers to the very high water table in the area at the time the name was chosen, and the many corresponding artesian wells in the area. Early settlers constructed drainage canals to make the land usable for agriculture, which remained the dominant use of land until the 1960s, when construction of large housing tracts accelerated. The first mayor of Fountain Valley was James Kanno, who with this appointment became one of the first Japanese-American mayors of a mainland United States city.

After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, there was a large influx of Vietnamese refugees settling in Fountain Valley, especially in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, forming a large percentage of Asian Americans in the city.

==Geography==

Although the economy of the area was once based mainly on agriculture, the remaining production consists of several fields of strawberries or other small crops, which are gradually being replaced by new office development. Efforts to bolster economic activity are evidenced by the city enacting policies to benefit small businesses, and even going so far as to paint a mural on the facade of a large water treatment building facing the freeway that depicts two shopping bags headlined by the words, &quot;Shop in Fountain Valley.&quot;

<doc id="52826" wikidata="Q49220" url="?curid=52826" title="Fremont, California">
<text>Fremont () is a city in Alameda County, California, United States. Located in the East Bay region of the Bay Area, Fremont has a population of 230,504 as of 2020, making it the fourth most populous city in the Bay Area, behind San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland. It is the closest East Bay city to the high-tech Silicon Valley network of businesses, and has a strong tech industry presence.

The city&#x27;s origins lie in the community that arose around Mission San José, founded in 1797 by the Spanish under Padre Fermín Lasuén. Fremont was incorporated on January 23, 1956, when the former towns of Mission San José, Centerville, Niles, Irvington, and Warm Springs unified into one city. Fremont is named after John C. Frémont, a general who helped lead the American Conquest of California from Mexico and later served as Military Governor of California and then U.S. Senator.

==History==
===Early history===

The recorded history of the Fremont area began on June 6, 1797, when Mission San José was founded by the Spaniard Father Fermín de Lasuén. The Mission was established at the site of the Ohlone village of Oroysom. The tribe lived between present-day San Francisco and Monterey and more lands eastward. They lived in dome-shaped shelters made out of redwood bark or woven tule. They were primarily hunter-gatherers; men hunted and trapped waterfowl, rabbits, deer, elk, and bears, whilst women gathered nuts, berries, and root vegetables. The Ohlone tribe lived beside rivers and estuaries because of the natural resources like fish and shellfish. In warm weather, men wore mostly nothing; in the winter, they wore animal hide or feather capes. Other than the weather, ceremonies also decided what the Ohlone men wore. The women wore deerskin aprons over skirts made of tule or shredded bark.

Until 1769, the tribe lived peacefully but Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in California to expand Spanish dominion in the Americas and convert the Native Americans to Catholicism. The Ohlone people weren&#x27;t intimidated by the Franciscan priests, who welcomed them into their missions to live and work. Before missions, the Natives used tools made of stone, animal bones, and wood. The missionaries taught them how to make metal tools and weapons and priests also showed them how to make adobe bricks. The bricks were then used to build missions rather than for the tribe to utilize. The Spaniards brought cattle, pigs and sheep and encouraged the Ohlone to give up hunting and gathering to try farming and ranching instead. Living in the missions meant Ohlone people were forced into converting to Christianity and told to forget the superstitious beliefs that connected them to nature. Along with that, overpopulation caused food shortages and the Spanish brought diseases to the tribe, causing a lot of deaths and trouble that made an impact on a lot of lives.

On their second day in the area, the Mission party killed a grizzly bear in Niles Canyon. The first English-speaking visitor to Fremont was the renowned trapper and explorer Jedediah Smith in 1827. The Mission prospered, eventually reaching a population of 1,887 inhabitants in 1831. The influence of the missionaries declined after 1834 when the Mexican government enacted secularization.

José de Jesus Vallejo, brother of Mariano Vallejo, was the grantee of the Rancho Arroyo de la Alameda Mexican land grant. His family was influential in the Fremont area in the late colonial era and owned and built a flour mill at the mouth of Niles Canyon. In 1846 the town&#x27;s namesake John C. Frémont led a military expedition to map a trail through Mission Pass for reaching the Pacific coast and to take possession of California from Mexico for the United States.

The Fremont area grew rapidly at the time of the California Gold Rush. A town called Mission San José grew up around the old mission, with its own post office from 1850. Agriculture dominated the economy with grapes, nursery plants and olives as leading crops. In 1868 the 6.8-magnitude Hayward earthquake on the Hayward Fault collapsed buildings throughout the Fremont area, ruining Mission San José and its outbuildings. Until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake caused its destruction, the Fremont area&#x27;s Palmdale Winery was the largest in California. The ruins of the Palmdale Winery are still visible near the Five Corners in Irvington at the intersection of Washington Boulevard and Osgood.
From 1912 to 1915, the Niles section of the Fremont area was the earliest home of California&#x27;s motion picture industry (see Essanay Studios). Charlie Chaplin filmed several movies in the Fremont area, most notably &quot;The Tramp&quot;.

===Incorporation===
Fremont was incorporated in 1956 under the leadership of Wally Pond, chair of the incorporation committee, when five towns in the area, Irvington, Centerville, Mission San José, Niles, and Warm Springs, came together to form a city. Glenmoor Gardens, the largest subdivision in Fremont, was under construction in the area, by developers Ralph E. Cotter Jr., James R. Meyer, civil engineer Fred T. Duvall, and contractors James L. Reeder, and Robert H. Reeder. When the Glenmoor Gardens Homeowners Association (GGHA) was incorporated, in March 1953, there were no more than 75 houses in the subdivision. It was probably the first such organization in the Fremont area; in its scope and structure. The five-member board of directors (which included James Meyer and James Reeder) was set up to oversee a full range of services, from police and fire protection to street maintenance (which later became the purview of the city government).

Fremont became more industrialized between 1953 and 1962. The first Fremont post office opened in 1956. A boom in high-tech employment in the 1980s to the late 1990s, especially in the Warm Springs District, caused rapid development in the city and linked the city with the Silicon Valley. The Apple factory where the first Mac computer was manufactured was located in Fremont; production ceased in 1993. Other semiconductor and telecommunications firms soon opened in the city, including Cirrus Logic, Asyst Technologies, Mattson Technology, Lam Research, Premisys Communications, and Nextlink California. Approximately 750 high-tech companies had offices, headquarters, or production facilities in Fremont by 1999. These firms included fifteen of the top one hundred fastest-growing public companies in the San Francisco Bay Area and eighteen of the top fifty companies in the East Bay. The high-tech growth in Fremont continues today and is a major industry for the city.
The General Motors automotive assembly plant in South Fremont was the town&#x27;s largest employer, and Fremont was known for its drag strip. In the 1980s, the plant became a joint venture automotive assembly plant of Toyota and General Motors, and was renamed NUMMI. Toyota and NUMMI shut down its operations in early 2010. Part of the plant was acquired in June 2010 by Tesla Motors as its primary production plant, known as the Tesla Factory.

Solyndra, a solar panel manufacturer, was promoted in 2010 by President Barack Obama as a model for government investment in green technology after his administration approved a $535 million Department of Energy loan guarantee and the company built a $733 million state-of-the-art robotic facility, but in 2011 the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and laid off 1,000 workers. Data storage company Seagate Technology, incorporated in the Republic of Ireland with executive offices in Cupertino, acquired the former Solyndra building, which serves as Seagate&#x27;s headquarters as of 2020.

===Homeless criminalization===
In May 2024, the city council began considering a &quot;Strategic Plan to Address Homelessness&quot; in the city, with a five year time span, in order to reduce the homeless population. Many of the homeless in the city live in their vehicles, but the city&#x27;s Safe Parking measures of having designated parking lots for homeless people to stay were seen as only a temporary solution. This led to consideration in September 2024 of new rules that would place a ban on camping on public property and the use of large vehicles like RVs in residential areas. This would include a requirement for all parked vehicles in the city to be moved after 72 hours in a location. It was noted by &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reporter Sarah Ravani that the city&#x27;s previous efforts to actually help the homeless population by expanding housing options, among other methods, had resulted in a 21% reduction over the prior year in the amount of people that were homeless without needing municipal punishments to be enacted.

These bans were enacted by the city council in February 2025, with additional expansions to the proposed ordinance. The updated version included a $1000 fine and a misdemeanor criminal charge with six months jail time against anyone found &quot;aiding, abetting, or concealing&quot; members of the homeless population. The definition of these terms was not clarified in the ordinance. Over a dozen local civil rights groups and community organizations sent a letter petition against the ordinance, noting that the camping provision effectively made it illegal to be homeless anywhere in the city and the added abetting provision made it illegal for anyone to help homeless people by providing shelter themselves. David Bonaccorsi from the Fremont for Everyone organization pointed out that the growing amount of jobs in the city due to the expanding tech center had not included an adequate expansion in housing, meaning many of the people obtaining the new jobs had no housing available to purchase in the first place.

==Geography==
In 1956, five small, independent towns (Centerville, Niles, Irvington, Mission San José, and Warm Springs) located between the East Bay rolling hills and the San Francisco Bay were annexed into a single new, incorporated city called Fremont. Six decades later, these places have greatly expanded, are no longer separate communities, and are considered districts or community plan areas of the City of Fremont. The town of Newark was originally slated to join the annex, but ultimately its voters declined since Newark representatives suspected that they would become an industrial district; Newark became its own incorporated city in 1955. Later, Newark annexed a patch of unincorporated land between Mowry Avenue and Stevenson Boulevard, land which is now occupied by Newpark Mall and the surrounding plazas. Since incorporation, Fremont has created six more districts, which it calls &quot;community plan areas&quot; for planning purposes. These include Central, North Fremont, South Fremont, and Bayside. The two other districts, Baylands and the Hill Areas, are primarily open space.

The area consisting of Fremont and the cities of Newark and Union City is known collectively as the Tri-City Area (different from the adjacent Tri-Valley area encompassing Pleasanton, Dublin, and Livermore).

===Centerville District===
Centerville was formerly the main town in Washington Township. Centerville is located at . It lies at an elevation of . Centerville was started by George Lloyd who started selling cold beer to stage passengers from a tent in 1850. Capt. George Bond set up a general store and the name Centerville was chosen. The post office opened Centreville post office in 1855 and changed the spelling to Centerville in 1893. The Centerville Pioneer Cemetery contains the burial places of many of the city&#x27;s founding pioneers.

Centerville can be traced back to its native American roots. Spanish, Mexican, Italian, Portuguese and Swiss (Swiss Park), peoples were among the early settlers that contributed greatly to the growth of Centerville.

Early Centerville was a quiet farming community, which consisted of large Spanish land grants divided into smaller farms. The Freitas Ranch on Thornton Ave was probably the largest of the working farms. There were acres of apricot along with other fruit and nut orchards and large fields of various types of fresh produce.
After President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized military commanders to exclude &quot;any or all persons&quot; from certain areas in the name of national defense, the Western Defense Command began ordering Japanese Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for &quot;evacuation&quot; from the newly created military zones. This included many Centerville farming families.

Centerville was also a main stop for the early railways. This gave the local farmers a way to quickly get their produce to market. With the access to railway service there was once a large cannery on Baine Ave. west of Fremont Ave. (now Peralta) next to the tracks. In 1959, the cannery was destroyed in the largest fire in Fremont&#x27;s history. The fire lasted for two days, and effectively put an end to what had been the largest employer in Centerville at the time. The cannery was never rebuilt.

Housing developments began to appear in the area after World War II. Most of the early housing stood along Fremont Blvd from Decoto Road south to Washington High school, along Thornton Ave from Fremont Blvd west to the Newark city border, and along Peralta Blvd from Fremont Blvd to Niles.

For city planning purposes, Centerville was enlarged to encompass most of the north central residential section of Fremont, from Mowry Ave to Decoto Rd, from I-880 to the BART line. This Centerville community plan area includes the sprawling subdivisions, developed in the 1950s and 1960s, of Glenmoor Gardens, bounded by Central Avenue, Fremont Boulevard, Mowry Avenue, and the I-880 freeway. and the Cabrillo Park subdivision bound by Thornton Ave, Fremont Blvd, Decoto Road and the I-880 freeway. Also the Brookvale subdivisions, the Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area, and part of Parkmont. The area is served by two high schools, Washington High School established in 1892, which for a long time was the only high school in the area and American High School established in 1972. It also has two middle schools, Centerville Middle School and Thornton Middle School, which now stands on the old main site of the Freitas ranch.

===Niles District===

The former town of Niles is physically divided from other parts of Fremont and neighboring Union City by Mission Boulevard (State Route 238) to the east and north, Alameda Creek to the south, Union Pacific Railroad to the west and southeast, and the Quarry Lakes to the southwest. The hills of Niles are lower than those of the area south of the Alameda Creek in Mission San Jose. Old Town Niles features its own library, post office, and silent movie theater as well as a large number of antique and craft stores. Niles is located at . It lies at an elevation of .

The community, once called Vallejo Mills, got its name from the Central Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Niles junction and station, opened in April 1870 as part of the First transcontinental railroad and named after their railroad attorney and stockholder Addison Niles, who became associate justice on the California Supreme Court two years later. A post office was opened at Niles on Vallejo Street in 1873.

Niles was the West Coast home (1912–1916) of one of the first motion picture companies, Essanay Studios. Charlie Chaplin and Broncho Billy Anderson filmed some of their most famous silent movies in Niles and the scenic Niles Canyon that stretches between Niles and Sunol. The nonprofit Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum offers both artifacts of Niles&#x27; early years and, each Saturday evening, screenings of early-twentieth-century silent films, many of which were filmed locally.

The Niles Canyon Railway runs along Alameda Creek in Niles Canyon and carries passengers on weekend excursions, including a holiday &quot;train of lights&quot;, which is extremely popular – tickets for these trains typically sell out by early October. The Niles Canyon Railroad has a small but well-maintained collection of historic rail stock.

Part of historic Niles is Mayhew Spring, also known as Mayhew&#x27;s Sulphur Spring, which was owned by H.A. Meyhew and located north of the Niles railroad station. In September 1869, four months after the famous golden spike ceremony at Promontory Summit, Utah, the Central Pacific Railroad completed the transcontinental rail link between Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay, with trains switching at the San Jose junction in the canyon. Central Pacific then built a junction in the valley and opened it in April 1870 as Niles.

Also part of Niles is 1909 Niles Junction built by the Western Pacific Railroad, located at and situated at an elevation of .

===Irvington District===

The Irvington District area, once the town of Irving, has cycled through many name changes over time. In the early 1850s two emancipated black men were traveling with E.L. Beard through California, reputedly in search of a fortune. The former slaves noticed the busy traffic at the crossroads of what is today the &quot;Five Corners&quot; intersection. Although now gone, there were two embarcaderos (water crossings) at this area. One of these crossings had a ferry. Realizing the financial opportunity of the area, the former slaves constructed the first building at the cross roads, a tavern with an inn. This tavern was later known as Dave&#x27;s Saloon. This corner, today the intersection of Fremont and Washington Boulevards, Union and Bay Streets, is now commonly known as &quot;Five Corners&quot; or Irvington Square. Irvington Square&#x27;s marker, Irvington Plaza park, is located at . The inn and several of the other original buildings were demolished by the city of Fremont in the early 1980s.
In 1871 Washington College, the first industrial educational institution in California was established in Washington township near the crossroads. As a result, the US Postal Service established a post office called Washington Corners at the college in 1870, which became the name of the settlement on the 1878 Alameda County map of Washington Township.

In 1884, realizing the need for a proper town name, local inhabitants selected the name of Irving. The name was chosen in honor of Judge Irving, the local traveling circuit judge of the time. Later, when the railroad came through the area, the published train schedule pamphlets erroneously listed the Irving train depot as &quot;Irvington.&quot; The town petitioned the railroad about the error. The railroad company notified the town that it was too costly for them to replace the train schedule pamphlets (over $100,000); and in 1887 following the recommendation, the people of Irving changed the town name to Irvington.

The Irvington district has two main neighborhoods: Irvington Woods and the Irvington Square. The neighborhood is ethnically mixed and is primarily working class. For city planning purposes, the Irvington area was enlarged to encompass most of the south central residential section of Fremont, from Auto Mall Parkway to Mowry Avenue, from I-880 to roughly the BART line (excluding the Central District described below). This Irvington community plan area includes the Sundale neighborhood, the South Sundale neighborhood, 28 Palms, Blacow, and Grimmer subdivisions. The area is served by three high schools: Irvington High School, Robertson High School, and John F. Kennedy High School.

The Irvingtonian period of North American mammals is named for this district due to the fossil sequence excavated here.

===Mission San Jose District===

At the time of the California Gold Rush, a boom town grew up around the old Mission, to equip and transport 49ers overland to the gold fields. A post office was opened at Mission San Jose in 1850.

The district, like Niles, is surrounded by hills. The hills are higher and steeper than Niles, with the highest points being on the Mission Ridge. Mission San Jose district lies close to the northern two peaks, Mission Peak and Mount Allison. The height of the peaks range from 2,517 to , and they see some snowfall occasionally. Mission Peak is a popular hiking spot and attracts residents from all over the East Bay.

Fremont&#x27;s community college, Ohlone College, is situated one block away from the mission and serves over 12,000 students.

Mission San Jose has the highest concentration of Asian Americans in Fremont – over 50% of the population as of the 2000 census. The local high school is Mission San Jose High School, ranked as the 93rd best high school in the nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report, as well as 13th in California (as of 2024). The median family income for the Mission San Jose area (ZIP code 94539) exceeded $114,595 in 2005. Owing to an influx of professionals and other affluent families seeking access to the top-performing local public schools, Mission San Jose&#x27;s median home value reached $831,000 in 2006, earning the community a rank of 237 on Forbes magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 most affluent communities in the United States.

====Mission San Jose====

Nestled at the base of Fremont&#x27;s rolling hills is the Mission San José, one of the oldest of the Spanish missions in California, for which this district is named. The church building that exists today is a reconstruction (dedicated in 1985 for daily Mass and tours) of the original 1809 adobe church that was destroyed by the 1868 Hayward-fault earthquake. One side of the original mission quadrangle remains, housing a museum. Mission San Jose is located at ; and lies at an elevation of .

===Warm Springs District===

The former town of Warm Springs is located on Rancho Agua Caliente and is so named for the springs that are located there. In early times, there was a settlement called Harrisburgh (also, Harrisburg and Peacock&#x27;s) a short distance east from the small settlement of Warm Springs. A post office opened in Harrisburgh in 1865 and changed its name to Warm Springs in 1885. The name Harrisburgh commemorated Abram Harris, who settled there in 1858. The name Peacock&#x27;s commemorated George W. Peacock, its first postmaster. The post office name changed to Warmsprings in 1895 and reverted to Warm Springs in 1950.

The Warm Springs district is the southernmost portion of Fremont whose hub is the Warm Springs and Mission Boulevard intersection. It is located at , and lies at an elevation of . Warm Springs has attracted the headquarters of many high-tech companies including Nielsen Norman Group, Lam Research, Corsair and Lexar of the US as well as foreign high-tech companies such as Elitegroup Computer Systems, and Asus. The district is also home to blue-collar industry. The San Jose mission is also present.

Warm Springs also serves as commercial center for the mainly residential Mission San Jose district, especially since the construction of Pacific Commons, a large, modern regional shopping center. The Oakland Athletics talked about moving their stadium to this area. Warm Springs was home to one of the SF Bay Area&#x27;s only two coffee houses to employ baristas who wear bikinis, Your Coffee Cups, a concept that&#x27;s gained some controversy from Bay Area newspapers and news stations. This controversy led to the eventual closing of the business.

The BART extension to Warm Springs began construction in 2009 and Warm Springs/South Fremont station opened for service on March 25, 2017.

===Central district===
The central district is surrounded by the Centerville, Niles, Mission San Jose, and Irvington communities. The central district contains retail shopping centers (e.g., the Fremont Hub), the Fremont Bay Area Rapid Transit station, health care centers and Central Park (Lake Elizabeth).

City planners envisioned and have begun to develop a mid-density, pedestrian friendly, transit oriented development, bounded by Mowry Ave, Fremont Blvd, Walnut Ave, and Paseo Padre Pkwy referred to as Downtown Fremont. To support enhanced access, one of the central streets, the Capital Avenue extension to Fremont Blvd, was completed in 2016, as the city pursues its plans for a Downtown Fremont.

Most of Fremont is part of the Laguna Creek Watershed.

===North Fremont District===

North Fremont is a primarily residential district surrounded by Union City, Centerville District, Newark, and Coyote Hills Regional Park. It is a growing community that includes the Ardenwood neighborhood, the Lakes and Birds neighborhood, and the Northgate neighborhood. It is the site of the Ardenwood Historic Farm, which has the George Washington Patterson House as one of its highlights, and the Ardenwood Technology Park. A 99 Ranch Market is one of many Asian businesses in the North Fremont District. Thornton Middle School and American High School, which are both physically located in the enlarged Centerville District, also serve as the middle and high school, respectively, for this community.

===South Fremont District===
South Fremont is a primarily industrial district, east of Interstate 880 and west of Interstate 680, south of Auto Mall Parkway and north of Brown Rd. The area overlaps with Warm Springs, with which it shares the eponymous BART station. The composition of the area will change, because thousands of residential units were under construction as of 2016. It is sandwiched between the Irvington and Warm Springs community plan areas. It is noted as the site of the Tesla Factory as well as the site of the Warm Springs / South Fremont BART station. In 2022, a pedestrian bridge was built from the BART station to Lopes Court. It cost $41 million.

===Bayside Industrial District===
Bayside Industrial is a primarily industrial and commercial district, west of Interstate 880 between Newark and Milpitas.

===Hill Area District===
Hill Area is an open land district that forms the eastern edge of Fremont. It is the site of Mission Peak.

===Climate===
Fremont has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) typical of the San Francisco Bay Area. This climate features warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Like nearby San Jose, precipitation is fairly low (about per year) because the city lies in the rain shadow of the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west. The highest temperature recorded was on September 6, 2022. The lowest temperature recorded was on December 23, 1990.

==Demographics==
===2020===

The per capita income for the city was $31,411. About 4.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.9% of those under age 18 and 6.2% of those age 65 or over.

===2010===
The 2010 United States Census reported that Fremont had a population of 214,089. The population density was .

The Census reported that 212,438 people (99.2% of the population) lived in households, 969 (0.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 682 (0.3%) were institutionalized.

There were 71,004 households, out of which 31,070 (43.8%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 45,121 (63.5%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 7,070 (10.0%) had a female householder with no husband present, 3,382 (4.8%) had a male householder with no wife present.

Fremont has a large Deaf community, in large part because it is home of the Northern California campus of the California School for the Deaf. The school district is called the Fremont Unified School District which also serves parts of Union City and Hayward.

=== Race and ethnicity ===
As of 2010, more than half the residents of Fremont were of Asian ancestry, with large populations of Chinese, Asian Indians, and Filipinos.

The racial makeup of Fremont was:

* 108,332 (50.6%) Asian (consisting of 18.1% Indian, 17.8% Chinese, 6.7% Filipino, 2.5% Vietnamese, 1.8% Korean, 1.0% Pakistani, 0.8% Japanese, 0.6% Burmese)

Due in large part to a substantial influx of Afghans granted asylum in the United States following the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union, Fremont is the home to the largest concentration of Afghan Americans in the United States. Judith Miller of &quot;City Journal&quot; wrote that unlike many ethnic groups, the Afghans in Fremont have few political representatives at various levels and an insular focus. This concentration is noted in Khaled Hosseini&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;Kite Runner&quot;.

Fremont and nearby Union City have fairly large numbers of Pacific Islanders, Cubans and Puerto Ricans, Spanish and Portuguese, and a small number of American Indians.

==Economy==
Companies headquartered in Fremont include Antec Inc, Corsair Gaming, Electronics for Imaging, Ikanos Communications, Lam Research, Seagate Technology, Fremont Bank, Nielsen Norman Group, Oplink Communications, SYNNEX, S3 Graphics, Tailored Brands and DCKAP.

==Culture and recreation==
The City of Fremont has been a Tree City USA since 1996. There are approximately 55,000 trees in city parks, streets, and landscaped boulevard areas. The city operates the Olive Hyde Art Gallery, adjacent to Mission San Jose, which has featured Bay Area artists such as Wendy Yoshimura, the California Society of Printmakers and the Etsy collective. The public gallery is housed in a former home of Olive Hyde, a descendant of early San Francisco Mayor George Hyde.

===Media===

Founded in 2002, the &quot;Tri-City Voice&quot; serves Fremont and the nearby cities of Union City and Newark. The weekly is based in the Fremont, and publishes the city&#x27;s legal notices.

==Government==

An elected mayor heads Fremont city government for a four-year term. The mayor chairs the city council, which has four elected council members in addition to the mayor. Two new seats have been added to the council beginning in 2018, for a total of seven seats when district-based elections are phased in. The council adopts the city&#x27;s budget, and decides major policies. The city council appoints a city manager and city attorney. The city manager hires city staff and manages day-to-day business. Advisory bodies work with the city council on some issues, to facilitate the council&#x27;s final decisions. The mayor appoints advisory body members, subject to the approval of a majority of the council. Most members serve four-year terms of office without pay, with the exception of planning commissioners.

The City of Fremont directly provides services related to public safety, land use regulation, infrastructure maintenance, parks and recreation, and local social services. To provide these services, the city government is organized into 22 departments, from Animal Services to Transportation Engineering.

According to a 2009 financial report, city revenues were $280 million, expenditures $200 million, assets $1,200 million, cash and investments $340 million, and liabilities $260 million. As of 2015, the annual budget was $160 million and the city had 800 employees.

The city council has adopted a balanced budget by July 1 of each year. Budget problems have in some past years involved cuts in services, reductions in city staffing and wage concessions by labor unions.

Special districts provide water and sewer services for the city: Alameda County Water District and Union Sanitary District. A private contractor, Allied Waste, provides garbage collection and recycling services to the city.

===Grand jury investigation of record-keeping===
In 2015, a grand jury found that the city government did not comply with state law on public records, by deleting most emails after 30 days instead of the required two years. All emails were automatically labeled as &quot;unsaved drafts&quot; unless manually designated for retention. The city did not keep any record of councilmember emails, which used fremont.gov addresses and were relayed on to councilmembers&#x27; private email accounts. Though city officials held that automatic deletion would reduce data storage costs, the grand jury determined that the cost of complying with the state law would not be significant.

===District-based elections===

The city phased in district-based instead of at-large elections for all but one seat on the city council, beginning in November 2018. Two new seats were added, from five seats to seven. Six of the seats required residence inside a district, while the seat held by the mayor remained at large. The council chose the new district boundaries in June 2017, a controversial vote that drew accusations of gerrymandering to favor two of the incumbents.

The districting was forced by the threat of a legal action from a group claiming that Latino minorities comprising 14 percent of the population had not been adequately represented. Few or no Latinos were elected to the council during 1956–2017. Some claimed that the results of precinct voting may have been polarized along racial lines.

===Politics===

According to the California Secretary of State, as of February 20, 2024, the city of Fremont has 118,717 registered voters. Of those, 59,594 (50.19%) are registered Democrats, 17,021 (14.34%) are registered Republicans, and 37,095 (31.24%) have declined to state a political party.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===

The Fremont Unified School District has five high schools for grades 9–12: American, Irvington, Kennedy, Mission San Jose and Washington. The 5,000 seat Tak Fudenna Stadium serves all five high schools as a venue for football, track, soccer and high school graduation ceremonies. These five high schools, along with James Logan High School in Union City and Newark Memorial High School in Newark, make up the Mission Valley Athletic League (M.V.A.L.).

The district has a continuation high school (Robertson); two independent study programs (Vista and COIL); an adult school; five middle schools for grades 6–8 (Centerville, Hopkins, Horner, Thornton and Walters); and
29 elementary schools. The district operates the Mission Valley Regional Occupational Program jointly with Newark and New Haven Unified School Districts.

For the year 2019, William Hopkins JHS, Mission San Jose HS, John F. Kennedy HS, and American HS all received the California Distinguished Schools Award, administered by the California Department of Education.

Fremont Christian School and Averroes High School in Fremont are not part of FUSD. California School for the Deaf, Fremont serves Northern California and shares a campus with the statewide California School for the Blind.

===Colleges and universities===
The Ohlone Community College District operates Ohlone College in Fremont, and a smaller campus in Newark. The University of Phoenix Bay Area Campus and San Francisco Bay University offers undergraduate and graduate programs in technology and management areas.

===Public libraries===
The Alameda County Library is headquartered in Fremont. The Fremont Main Library is the largest branch with the highest circulation of the Alameda County Library, and shares its building with the Alameda County Library Administration. It has the Maurice Marks Center for Local and California History, and the Fukaya public meeting room. Alameda County Library has other branch libraries in Centerville, Irvington and Niles.

==Transportation==


Fremont is served by Interstate 880 (Nimitz Freeway) and Interstate 680 (Sinclair Freeway). Though they do not intersect, they are connected in the Warm Springs district via a very busy one-mile segment of Mission Boulevard which is SR 262. In addition, it is served by SR 84 and the segment of Mission Boulevard which is SR 238. The city is the eastern terminus of the Dumbarton Bridge.

Elevated sound levels exist along Interstate 880; Caltrans and the city have sought to mitigate sound levels by constructing noise barriers.

Regional rail transportation is provided by BART and the Altamont Corridor Express (ACE). Fremont&#x27;s BART station once served as the southernmost terminus for the BART system; a BART extension to the Warm Springs / South Fremont station opened on March 25, 2017. A southward BART extension into Santa Clara county and the Milpitas and Berryessa/North San José stations opened on June 13, 2020; a further BART extension to downtown San Jose is in the planning stages. The Fremont-Centerville station provides a stopping point for ACE service, which travels from Stockton to San Jose, as well as for Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; service. Bus service is provided by AC Transit locally.

===Future rail===
Caltrain is undertaking environmental and engineering review for a planned Dumbarton Rail Corridor between the Peninsula and Alameda County. It would add Caltrain stations to Union City, Fremont-Centerville, Newark, and Menlo Park/East Palo Alto.

<text>The volumetric heat capacity of a material is the heat capacity of a sample of the substance divided by the volume of the sample. It is the amount of energy that must be added, in the form of heat, to one unit of volume of the material in order to cause an increase of one unit in its temperature. The SI unit of volumetric heat capacity is joule per kelvin per cubic meter, J⋅K−1⋅m−3.

The volumetric heat capacity can also be expressed as the specific heat capacity (heat capacity per unit of mass, in J⋅K−1⋅kg−1) times the density of the substance (in kg/L, or g/mL). It is defined to serve as an intensive property.

This quantity may be convenient for materials that are commonly measured by volume rather than mass, as is often the case in engineering and other technical disciplines. The volumetric heat capacity often varies with temperature, and is different for each state of matter. While the substance is undergoing a phase transition, such as melting or boiling, its volumetric heat capacity is technically infinite, because the heat goes into changing its state rather than raising its temperature.

The volumetric heat capacity of a substance, especially a gas, may be significantly higher when it is allowed to expand as it is heated (volumetric heat capacity &quot;at constant pressure&quot;) than when is heated in a closed vessel that prevents expansion (volumetric heat capacity &quot;at constant volume&quot;).

If the amount of substance is taken to be the number of moles in the sample (as is sometimes done in chemistry), one gets the molar heat capacity (whose SI unit is joule per kelvin per mole, J⋅K−1⋅mol−1).

==Definition==
The volumetric heat capacity is defined as
:formula_1

where formula_2 is the volume of the sample at temperature formula_3, and formula_4 is the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of the sample from formula_3 to formula_6. This parameter is an intensive property of the substance.

Since both the heat capacity of an object and its volume may vary with temperature, in unrelated ways, the volumetric heat capacity is usually a function of temperature too. It is equal to the specific heat formula_7 of the substance times its density (mass per volume) formula_8, both measured at the temperature formula_3. Its SI unit is joule per kelvin per cubic meter (J⋅K−1⋅m−3).

This quantity is used almost exclusively for liquids and solids, since for gases it may be confused with the &quot;specific heat capacity at constant volume&quot;, which generally has very different values. International standards now recommend that &quot;specific heat capacity&quot; always refer to capacity per unit of mass. Therefore, the word &quot;volumetric&quot; should always be used for this quantity.

==History==
Dulong and Petit predicted in 1818 that the product of solid substance density and specific heat capacity (ρcp) would be constant for all solids. This amounted to a prediction that volumetric heat capacity in solids would be constant. In 1819 they found that volumetric heat capacities were not quite constant, but that the most constant quantity was the heat capacity of solids adjusted by the presumed weight of the atoms of the substance, as defined by Dalton (the Dulong–Petit law). This quantity was proportional to the heat capacity per atomic weight (or per molar mass), which suggested that it is the heat capacity &quot;per atom&quot; (not per unit of volume) which is closest to being a constant in solids.

Eventually it became clear that heat capacities per particle for all substances in all states are the same, to within a factor of two, so long as temperatures are not in the cryogenic range.

==Typical values==
The volumetric heat capacity of solid materials at room temperatures and above varies widely, from about 1.2 MJ⋅K−1⋅m−3 (for example bismuth) to 3.4 MJ⋅K−1⋅m−3 (for example iron). This is mostly due to differences in the physical size of atoms. Atoms vary greatly in density, with the heaviest often being more dense, and thus are closer to taking up the same average volume in solids than their mass alone would predict. If all atoms &quot;were&quot; the same size, molar and volumetric heat capacity would be proportional and differ by only a single constant reflecting ratios of the atomic molar volume of materials (their atomic density). An additional factor for all types of specific heat capacities (including molar specific heats) then further reflects degrees of freedom available to the atoms composing the substance, at various temperatures.

For most liquids, the volumetric heat capacity is narrower, for example octane at 1.64 MJ⋅K−1⋅m−3 or ethanol at 1.9. This reflects the modest loss of degrees of freedom for particles in liquids as compared with solids.

However, water has a very high volumetric heat capacity, at 4.18 MJ⋅K−1⋅m−3, and ammonia is also fairly high: 3.3 MJ⋅K−1⋅m−3.

For gases at room temperature, the range of volumetric heat capacities per atom (not per molecule) only varies between different gases by a small factor less than two, because every ideal gas has the same molar volume. Thus, each gas molecule occupies the same mean volume in all ideal gases, regardless of the type of gas (see kinetic theory). This fact gives each gas molecule the same effective &quot;volume&quot; in all ideal gases (although this volume/molecule in gases is far larger than molecules occupy on average in solids or liquids). Thus, in the limit of ideal gas behavior (which many gases approximate except at low temperatures and/or extremes of pressure) this property reduces differences in gas volumetric heat capacity to simple differences in the heat capacities of individual molecules. As noted, these differ by a factor depending on the degrees of freedom available to particles within the molecules.

==Volumetric heat capacity of gases==
Large complex gas molecules may have high heat capacities per mole (of molecules), but their heat capacities per mole of atoms are very similar to those of liquids and solids, again differing by less than a factor of two per mole of atoms. This factor of two represents vibrational degrees of freedom available in solids vs. gas molecules of various complexities.

In monatomic gases (like argon) at room temperature and constant volume, volumetric heat capacities are all very close to 0.5 kJ⋅K−1⋅m−3, which is the same as the theoretical value of RT per kelvin per mole of gas molecules (where R is the gas constant and T is temperature). As noted, the much lower values for gas heat capacity in terms of volume as compared with solids (although more comparable per mole, see below) results mostly from the fact that gases under standard conditions consist of mostly empty space (about 99.9% of volume), which is not filled by the atomic volumes of the atoms in the gas. Since the molar volume of gases is very roughly 1000 times that of solids and liquids, this results in a factor of about 1000 loss in volumetric heat capacity for gases, as compared with liquids and solids. Monatomic gas heat capacities per atom (not per molecule) are decreased by a factor of 2 with regard to solids, due to loss of half of the potential degrees of freedom per atom for storing energy in a monatomic gas, as compared with regard to an ideal solid. There is some difference in the heat capacity of monatomic vs. polyatomic gasses, and also gas heat capacity is temperature-dependent in many ranges for polyatomic gases; these factors act to modestly (up to the discussed factor of 2) increase heat capacity per atom in polyatomic gases, as compared with monatomic gases. Volumetric heat capacities in polyatomic gases vary widely, however, since they are dependent largely on the number of atoms per molecule in the gas, which in turn determines the total number of atoms per volume in the gas.

The volumetric heat capacity is defined as having SI units of J/(m3⋅K). It can also be described in Imperial units of BTU/(ft3⋅°F).

==Volumetric heat capacity of solids ==
Since the bulk density of a solid chemical element is strongly related to its molar mass (usually about 3&quot;R&quot; per mole, as noted above), there exists noticeable inverse correlation between a solid&#x27;s density and its specific heat capacity on a per-mass basis. This is due to a very approximate tendency of atoms of most elements to be about the same size, despite much wider variations in density and atomic weight. These two factors (constancy of atomic volume and constancy of mole-specific heat capacity) result in a good correlation between the &quot;volume&quot; of any given solid chemical element and its total heat capacity. Another way of stating this, is that the volume-specific heat capacity (volumetric heat capacity) of solid elements is roughly a constant. The molar volume of solid elements is very roughly constant, and (even more reliably) so also is the molar heat capacity for most solid substances. These two factors determine the volumetric heat capacity, which as a bulk property may be striking in consistency. For example, the element uranium is a metal which has a density almost 36 times that of the metal lithium, but uranium&#x27;s volumetric heat capacity is only about 20% larger than lithium&#x27;s.

Since the volume-specific corollary of the Dulong–Petit specific heat capacity relationship requires that atoms of all elements take up (on average) the same volume in solids, there are many departures from it, with most of these due to variations in atomic size. For instance, arsenic, which is only 14.5% less dense than antimony, has nearly 59% more specific heat capacity on a mass basis. In other words; even though an ingot of arsenic is only about 17% larger than an antimony one of the same mass, it absorbs about 59% more heat for a given temperature rise. The heat capacity ratios of the two substances closely follows the ratios of their molar volumes (the ratios of numbers of atoms in the same volume of each substance); the departure from the correlation to simple volumes in this case is due to lighter arsenic atoms being significantly more closely packed than antimony atoms, instead of similar size. In other words, similar-sized atoms would cause a mole of arsenic to be 63% larger than a mole of antimony, with a correspondingly lower density, allowing its volume to more closely mirror its heat capacity behavior.

==Volumetric heat capacity of liquids ==
The volumetric heat capacity of liquids could be measured from the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity correlation. The volumetric heat capacity of liquids could be directly obtained during thermal conductivity analysis using thermal conductivity analyzers that use techniques like the transient plane source method.

== Constant volume and constant pressure ==

For gases it is necessary to distinguish between volumetric heat capacity at constant volume and volumetric heat capacity at constant pressure, which is always larger due to the pressure–volume work done as a gas expands during heating at constant pressure (thus absorbing heat which is converted to work). The distinctions between constant-volume and constant-pressure heat capacities are also made in various types of specific heat capacity (the latter meaning either mass-specific or mole-specific heat capacity).

==Thermal inertia==

Thermal inertia is a term commonly used to describe the observed delays in a body&#x27;s temperature response during heat transfers. The phenomenon exists because of a body&#x27;s ability to both store and transport heat relative to its environment. Larger values of volumetric heat capacity, as may occur in association with thermal effusivity, typically yield slower temperature responses.

<text>Lindsay Ann Davenport Leach (born June 8, 1976) is an American former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 98 weeks (including as the year-end No. 1 four times), and as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s doubles for 32 weeks. Davenport won 55 WTA Tour-level singles titles, including three majors (the 1998 US Open, 1999 Wimbledon Championships, and 2000 Australian Open), the gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and the 1999 Tour Finals. She also won 38 doubles titles, including three majors (the 1996 French Open, 1999 Wimbledon Championships, and the 1997 US Open) and three consecutive Tour Finals.

In 2005, &quot;TENNIS Magazine&quot; ranked Davenport as the 29th-greatest player (male or female) of the preceding 40 years. She amassed career-earnings of US$22,166,338; formerly first in the all-time rankings. Davenport was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Early life==
Lindsay Davenport is the daughter of Wink Davenport, who was a member of the U.S. volleyball team at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, and Ann L. Davenport, the president of the Southern California Volleyball Association. Davenport was born to an athletic family. While her two older sisters, Leiann and Shannon, played volleyball, Lindsay began playing tennis at age six. She was coached by Robert Lansdorp, who had previously coached Tracy Austin. She attended Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Peninsula, California. At age 16, her family moved to Murrieta, California, where she attended and graduated from Murrieta Valley High School, and she began to work with, among others, Robert Van&#x27;t Hof. At age 16, Davenport joined the United States Tennis Association junior national team. She had a rapid growth spurt — about six inches in two years — which affected her coordination, but did not hinder her performance. She excelled at junior level competitions and swept the singles and doubles titles at the National Girls&#x27; 18s and Clay Court Championships in 1991 and won the Junior U.S. Open in 1992.

==Career==
===1990–1993===
She won the girls&#x27; 16s singles at the prestigious Ojai Tennis Tournament in 1990.

While Davenport&#x27;s first play dated back to 1991, she officially became a professional two years after her first professional-level matches. Davenport&#x27;s doubles success in 1993 was a 17–16 record while she reached the top 100 in doubles rankings. She reached the third round at the 1993 Australian Open doubles competition with Chanda Rubin. Davenport entered the top 20, despite coming into her first tournament that year ranked no. 162. She qualified for the 1993 Australian Open, reaching the third round before falling to Mary Pierce.

At the Indian Wells Masters, Davenport reached the quarterfinals ranked no. 99, but lost to 7th-ranked and future doubles partner Mary Joe Fernández. Later that year, Davenport won her first Tier III title at the European Open where she beat Nicole Bradtke in three sets in the finals. She reached the third round at the 1993 Wimbledon Championships, and at the 1993 US Open, the American reached the fourth round ranked no. 24. 1993 is also notable because it was the one time she faced Martina Navratilova, falling in three sets, 6–1, 3–6, 5–7, in the Oakland semifinals.

===1994===
Davenport won the first professional tournament she entered in Brisbane, Australia. At the Australian Open, she reached her first Grand Slam quarterfinal, defeating no. 5 Mary Joe Fernández in the fourth round, before losing in the quarterfinals to top-ranked Steffi Graf. Davenport then reached the semifinals at Indian Wells, California and Miami and won the title in Lucerne. At Wimbledon, Davenport reached her second Grand Slam quarterfinal. Ranked ninth, Davenport defeated tenth ranked Gabriela Sabatini, before losing to third ranked Conchita Martínez, who went on to win the tournament. In November, she reached her first WTA Tour Championship final, losing to Sabatini.

In doubles, Davenport won Indian Wells with Lisa Raymond and reached the French Open doubles final with Raymond, where they lost to Gigi Fernández and Natasha Zvereva. Davenport teamed with Arantxa Sánchez Vicario to win the title in Oakland, defeating Gigi Fernández and Martina Navratilova in the final.

In December 1994, Davenport hired Craig Kardon as her coach.

===1995===
Davenport started the year by reaching the final of the tournament in Sydney, where she lost to Gabriela Sabatini. Davenport again reached the Australian Open quarterfinals and the following week, lost to Kimiko Date in the final of the tournament in Tokyo.

On clay, Davenport won the tournament in Strasbourg on her first attempt, defeating Kimiko Date in the final. Date, however, turned the tables at the French Open, defeating Davenport in the fourth round.

At Wimbledon, Davenport was upset in the fourth round by Mary Joe Fernández. At the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, the US Open, Davenport was again upset, this time in the second round by Zina Garrison Jackson.

In doubles, Davenport and Jana Novotná started the year by winning the tournament in Sydney. Davenport and Lisa Raymond then lost in the Australian Open semifinals to the top seeded team of Gigi Fernández and Natasha Zvereva. Davenport teamed with Nicole Arendt to reach the French Open semifinals, where they lost to the top seeded team of Novotná and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario. At Wimbledon, Davenport and Raymond, the fourth seeded team, were upset in the first round. At the US Open, Davenport and Raymond were again the fourth seeded team and were upset in the third round by fifteenth seeded Lori McNeil and Helena Suková. In other tournaments, Davenport and Raymond won in Indian Wells, and Davenport and Mary Joe Fernández won in Tokyo (the non-Tier I tournament) and Strasbourg.

After her one-year contract with Kardon had ended, Davenport hired Robert Van&#x27;t Hof as her full-time coach.

===1996===
Davenport&#x27;s year began with a runner-up finish in Sydney. She was a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open. Davenport then reached the semifinals of the tournament in Indian Wells, California, where she lost to Steffi Graf.

On clay, Davenport won the Strasbourg tournament and reached the French Open quarterfinals, losing to Conchita Martínez.

During the summer, Davenport won the tournament in Los Angeles, defeating Graf for the first time in her career in the semifinals, before defeating Anke Huber in the final. Davenport then won the gold medal at the Summer Olympics, defeating Mary Joe Fernández in the semifinal and Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the final.

In doubles, Davenport teamed with Mary Joe Fernández to win the tournament in Sydney, before losing in the final of the Australian Open to Chanda Rubin and Sánchez Vicario. Davenport and Fernandez then won the French Open doubles title, defeating Gigi Fernández and Natasha Zvereva in the final. The two also won the tournament in Oakland and the year-end Chase Championships together. Davenport partnered with Zvereva to win the tournament in Los Angeles.

===1997===
Davenport lost in the fourth round of the Australian Open to Kimberly Po. She then won the tournaments in Oklahoma City and Indian Wells, California for the first time in her career.

Davenport began her clay-court season by winning the tournament in Amelia Island, Florida. However, she lost to Iva Majoli, the eventual champion, in the fourth round at the French Open, despite being up a set and 4–0 in the second set.

At Wimbledon, Davenport lost to Denisa Chládková in the second round. She then lost to Monica Seles in the final at Los Angeles, after beating top-ranked Martina Hingis in the semifinals. After winning in Atlanta, Davenport reached her first grand slam semifinal at the US Open, losing to Hingis. Davenport won the titles in Zürich and Chicago, before losing the Philadelphia final to Hingis in a third set tie-break.

In doubles, Davenport was the runner-up in Sydney with Natasha Zvereva and at the Australian Open with Lisa Raymond. She won the US Open with Czech partner Jana Novotná. Davenport&#x27;s other doubles titles were in Tokyo, Indian Wells, Amelia Island, and Berlin.

===1998===
Davenport started 1998 by reaching the singles semifinals of the Australian Open, which was her second consecutive Grand Slam singles semifinal. At the tournament in Tokyo, Davenport, ranked second, defeated Martina Hingis, ranked first, in the final. Davenport then lost in the Indian Wells, California, final to Hingis, after defeating Steffi Graf, and in Miami, she fell in the quarterfinals to Anna Kournikova. At the French Open, Davenport defeated defending champion Iva Majoli in the quarterfinals, before losing to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals. Davenport won titles in San Diego, Stanford, and Los Angeles.

Davenport&#x27;s next victory on tour was her first Grand Slam singles title at the 1998 US Open, defeating fifth-ranked Venus Williams in the semifinals and top-ranked Hingis in the final. She became the first American-born woman to win the U.S. Open since Chris Evert in 1982.

Davenport then won Zürich and lost to 17th-ranked Graf in Philadelphia despite attaining the no. 1 ranking. Davenport finished the year with a loss to Hingis in the final of the Chase Championships .

In doubles, Davenport reached the final of the 1998 Australian Open with Natasha Zvereva, where they lost to the wildcard team of Hingis and Mirjana Lučić. Davenport and Zvereva lost to Hingis and Lučić again in the Tokyo final, and then won both Indian Wells and Berlin, both times defeating Alexandra Fusai and Nathalie Tauziat in the final.

Davenport and Zvereva then lost to Hingis and Jana Novotná in the French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open doubles finals. Davenport won San Diego and Stanford with Zvereva and lost in the US Open doubles final. Davenport won Filderstadt, and then the year-end doubles championship with Zvereva, defeating Fusai and Tauziat in three sets. In 1998, Davenport reached all four Grand Slam doubles finals with Zvereva, losing to teams that included Hingis all four times.

===1999===
Davenport started 1999 by winning the Sydney singles final and reaching the Australian Open singles semifinal, before losing to Amélie Mauresmo. She teamed with Natasha Zvereva to reach the doubles final, before losing to Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova.

At the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, Davenport and Zvereva beat Hingis and Jana Novotná, to whom they had lost in three of the four 1998 Grand Slam doubles finals. Davenport&#x27;s second singles title of the year was at Madrid where she defeated lucky loser Paola Suárez in the final.

At Roland Garros, she reached the quarter-finals losing to Steffi Graf. Along the way, she defeated qualifier and future four-times French Open champion Justine Henin in the second round. Davenport&#x27;s next tournament championship was at Wimbledon. In the final, she defeated Steffi Graf in Graf&#x27;s last career Grand Slam match. Davenport also won the doubles title at Wimbledon with Corina Morariu, defeating Mariaan de Swardt and Elena Tatarkova in the final.

After Wimbledon, Davenport won the singles and doubles titles in Stanford and won San Diego in doubles with Morariu over Serena and Venus Williams in the final, the only doubles final the sisters have ever lost in their playing careers. She lost the US Open semifinal to eventual champion Serena Williams. To close the year, Davenport won two additional singles and the Chase Championships with a victory over Hingis in the final.

===2000===
Davenport started the year by losing the Sydney singles final against Amélie Mauresmo.

Her next event was the 2000 Australian Open, which she won in singles without the loss of a set. Seeded second, Davenport defeated top-seeded Martina Hingis in the final. She and Corina Morariu lost in the doubles semifinals to Hingis and Mary Pierce. Two events later, at the Indian Wells, California tournament, Davenport again defeated Hingis and won the doubles title with Morariu over Anna Kournikova and Natasha Zvereva in the final. Hingis defeated Davenport in the Miami final.

At the French Open, Davenport was upset by the 22nd-ranked Dominique Van Roost in three sets in the first round. Van Roost again beat her at The Hastings Direct International Championships in Eastbourne.

Davenport reached the Wimbledon final, where she was beaten by Venus Williams. Davenport once again lost to Venus in the Stanford final and to Serena Williams in the Los Angeles final. She lost in the US Open final to Venus.

After losing to Hingis in the Zürich final, Davenport won two consecutive titles in Linz, defeating Venus Williams, and in Philadelphia. She upset Arantxa Sánchez Vicario at the Chase Championships by serving her all love games, then helped the United States win the 2000 Fed Cup over Spain.

===2001===
Davenport was at least a quarterfinalist in all seventeen of her singles events. She won seven singles titles, with victories in Tokyo, Scottsdale, Eastbourne, Los Angeles, Filderstadt, Zürich, and Linz. After clinching the year-end number one ranking in a semifinal win over Clijsters (where she injured her knee at the end of the match), she withdrew in the final of the year-end Chase Championships against Serena Williams. She was a semifinalist at the Australian Open, a semifinalist at Wimbledon, and a quarterfinalist at the US Open. She lost in the Australian Open doubles final with Morariu to Venus and Serena Williams. She teamed with Lisa Raymond to win the doubles titles in Filderstadt and Zürich.

===2002===
Davenport did not win a singles title in 2002. She missed the Australian Open, French Open, and Wimbledon. She played her first singles event in July, losing in the Stanford semifinals to Kim Clijsters. Davenport then reached the semifinals of the Tier I San Diego tournament, where she lost to Venus Williams. At her next tournament in Los Angeles, she lost in the final to Chanda Rubin. She then lost to Venus in New Haven and to Serena Williams in the US Open semifinals. She reached two more finals during 2002, losing in Moscow to Magdalena Maleeva and in Zürich to Patty Schnyder. At the year-end Chase Championships, Davenport lost to Monica Seles, after holding seven match points, her third loss to Seles, having a match point opportunity on all three occasions.

Davenport played her first doubles tournament of the year in Filderstadt in October, where she partnered with Lisa Raymond to win the title. Her relationship with Coach Robert Van&#x27;t Hof ended.

===2003===
Davenport started the year by hiring Rick Leach as her coach, but this association lasted only a short time. She then hired Adam Peterson. She reached the final of the tournament in Sydney, where she lost to Kim Clijsters. She then reached the fourth round of the Australian Open, where she lost to Justine Henin. Davenport then won in Tokyo and lost in the Indian Wells, California final to Clijsters. At the remaining Grand Slam tournaments of the year, she lost in the French Open fourth round, the Wimbledon quarterfinals, and the US Open semifinals. She was the runner-up at tournaments in Amelia Island, Florida, Los Angeles, and New Haven.

Davenport and Lisa Raymond reached the doubles semifinals of the Australian Open, where they lost to Serena Williams and Venus Williams. Davenport and Raymond won Indian Wells, defeating Clijsters and Ai Sugiyama. Davenport and Raymond also won in Amelia Island, over Paola Suárez and Virginia Ruano Pascual, and in Eastbourne, over Jennifer Capriati and Magüi Serna. Davenport and Raymond lost in the Wimbledon semifinals to Clijsters and Sugiyama.

===2004===
Davenport won a tour-high seven titles, including four straight during the summer (Stanford, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Cincinnati). She also had the most match wins on the WTA Tour, with 63. She finished the year ranked first for the third time in her career. She defeated Venus and Serena Williams for the first time since 2000, which she said instilled belief in her that she could win more Grand Slam tournaments.

===2005===
Davenport&#x27;s success continued into 2005, when she reached her first Grand Slam final, at the Australian Open, since the 2000 US Open; she fell to Serena Williams in three sets.

At the tournament in Indian Wells, California, in March, Davenport made history by defeating world no. 3 Maria Sharapova, 6–0, 6–0. It marked the first time that a player ranked in the top 3 had ever been &quot;shut out&quot; on the WTA tour and was the first time Sharapova had failed to win a game during a match. This turned out to be Davenport&#x27;s only career victory against Sharapova.

In April, she won the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Florida for the third time, defeating Silvia Farina Elia in the final. In the quarterfinals of that tournament, Davenport defeated Venus Williams for the fourth consecutive time.

Davenport bypassed the European clay-court season and went to the French Open without having played a professional competitive match for weeks. She confounded expectations with a run to the quarterfinals on her least favourite surface, including a come-from-behind victory over Kim Clijsters in the fourth round. Davenport lost to eventual runner-up Mary Pierce.

At Wimbledon, Davenport was the top seed and made it easily to the fourth round, where she was tested again by Clijsters, but came through in three sets to win her second successive match against the Belgian. Davenport then reached the semifinals, where her match against Amélie Mauresmo was interrupted by rain and was completed over the course of two days. Davenport eventually defeated Mauresmo and faced 14th-seeded Venus Williams in an all-American final. Davenport led most of the way, as she served for the match at 6–5 in the second set, and had a match point at 5–4 in the third set. Williams went on to win, 4–6, 7–6, 9–7, in the longest (in terms of time) women&#x27;s Wimbledon final in history. In that match, Davenport sustained a serious back injury while leading 4–2 (40–15) in the final set, although she acknowledged after the match that the injury did not cause her defeat and that Williams was the superior mentally strong player on the day. The injury forced Davenport to withdraw from Fed Cup competition. She returned to the tour at the Stanford tournament. After reinjuring her back in a warmup just hours before her match, Davenport retired while trailing 0–5 in the first set. This back injury then forced her to withdraw from other hard-court events in San Diego and Los Angeles.

Davenport returned to the WTA Tour in August, winning her comeback tournament in New Haven without dropping a set. Davenport then reached the quarterfinals of the US Open, where she held a match point on Elena Dementieva, before falling in the third set tie-break. Davenport briefly lost the no. 1 ranking following the event.

After the loss at the US Open, Davenport captured the title in Bali without dropping a set, and subsequently qualified for the WTA Tour Championships. She then won the title in Filderstadt, defeating Mauresmo in the final for the second consecutive year. The win made her only the tenth woman ever to win 50 career WTA singles titles.

In Zürich, Davenport saved two match points while defeating Daniela Hantuchová. The win assured Davenport of recapturing the world no. 1 ranking from Sharapova the following week. In the final, Davenport defeated sixth seeded Patty Schnyder for her fourth title in Zürich and her sixth title of 2005, second only to Clijsters&#x27;s nine. It was also the first time Davenport had saved match points en route to a victory since the 1999 U.S. Open. The Zürich title left her with eleven Tier I titles, second among active players.

Davenport was a semifinalist at the WTA tour year-end championships (losing to Pierce in two tie-breaks), which ensured that she finished the year ranked no. 1. 2005 was the fourth time that Davenport ended the year ranked no. 1, joining Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, and Chris Evert as the only female players to end a year ranked first at least four times.

In 2005, TENNIS Magazine ranked Davenport 29th in its list of the 40 greatest players of the tennis era.

===2006===
On February 22, 2006, Davenport became just the eighth woman in WTA history to win 700 singles matches, when she handed out her fourth career &quot;double bagel&quot;, defeating Elena Likhovtseva in the second round of the Dubai tournament.

At the March tournament in Indian Wells, California, Davenport lost in the fourth round to Martina Hingis. She was then absent from the tour until August because of a back injury. She returned in Los Angeles, losing a second-round match to Samantha Stosur. It was Davenport&#x27;s earliest exit from a tournament since early 2003. Davenport attributed the loss to her having resumed training only three weeks prior to the start of the tournament. Davenport had re-hired Adam Peterson as her coach, with whom she worked during her 2004–05 resurgence.

At the tournament in New Haven, Davenport defeated world no. 1 Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals, but was forced to retire with a right shoulder injury while playing Justine Henin in the final.

Despite injury, Davenport reached the US Open quarterfinals, where she again lost to Henin.

Davenport&#x27;s last competitive match before the December announcement of her pregnancy was a quarterfinal loss in Beijing to top-ranked Mauresmo. It was Mauresmo&#x27;s first win over Davenport after nine consecutive losses.

===2007===
On July 18, 2007, Davenport announced that she would return to the WTA Tour. At her first tournament, she partnered with Lisa Raymond in the doubles competition at New Haven, where they lost in the first round to top seeds Cara Black and Liezel Huber.

Davenport returned to singles competition in Bali, where she won her first title since 2005, defeating Daniela Hantuchová in the final. En route to the title, Davenport defeated third ranked Jelena Janković, among others. Davenport and her partner Hantuchová also advanced to the semifinals in Bali, before withdrawing from the tournament.

Davenport&#x27;s second tournament was in Beijing, where she defeated fourth-seeded Russian Elena Dementieva in the quarterfinals, before losing to Janković in the semifinals.

Davenport&#x27;s third tournament was in Quebec City, Canada, defeating second-seeded Vera Zvonareva in the semifinals and Julia Vakulenko in the final. This was Davenport&#x27;s 53rd career singles title and lifted her to no. 73 in the WTA rankings.

===2008===
Davenport won the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand, the first WTA tour event of the year. Davenport defeated Aravane Rezaï in the final. This raised her ranking to world no. 52. She was the only player in the WTA top 100 that had fewer than 10 tournaments counting towards her world ranking.

At the first Grand Slam tournament of the year, the Australian Open, Davenport lost in the second round to eventual champion Maria Sharapova, 1–6, 3–6. This was the first time that Davenport had lost to Sharapova in straight sets.

On January 14, 2008, Davenport surpassed Steffi Graf in career prize money earned on the women&#x27;s tour, garnering a total of US$21,897,501.

In March, Davenport won her second tournament of the year and 55th career singles title by beating Olga Govortsova in the final of the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships &amp; The Cellular South Cup in Memphis, Tennessee. She tied Virginia Wade for seventh place on the list of most singles titles won during the open era. Davenport also teamed with Lisa Raymond to win the doubles title.

At the Tier I Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, Davenport lost in the quarterfinals to Jelena Janković, 6–2, retired. She retired from the match because of a back injury sustained before the match started. At the Tier I Sony Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne, Florida, Davenport defeated world no. 2 and second-seeded Ana Ivanovic in the third round, 6–4, 6–2, before losing her fourth-round match with Dinara Safina, 3–6, 4–6.

In her first clay-court tournament since 2005, Davenport reached the semifinals of the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Florida, where she defaulted her match with Sharapova before it began, due to illness. Citing undisclosed personal reasons, Davenport withdrew from the French Open five days before the tournament began.

At Wimbledon, Davenport was seeded 25th, won her first-round match, and then withdrew from the tournament because of a right knee injury.

On August 8, 2008, Davenport withdrew from the singles competition at the Olympic Games in Beijing because of a lingering knee injury. She and her partner, world no. 1 doubles player Liezel Huber, lost in the women&#x27;s doubles quarterfinals.

At the US Open, Davenport was seeded 23rd and lost to 12th-seeded Marion Bartoli in the third round. Davenport was scheduled to play the Fortis Championships Luxembourg in October, but withdrew before the start of the tournament.

===2009===
Davenport announced her intention to play in the 2009 Australian Open in January, ending speculation that she would be retiring from the sport. However, she withdrew from the event when she learned that she was expecting her second child. It was announced on June 30, 2009, that Davenport had given birth to a baby girl.

===2010===
In her first tournament since the 2008 US Open, Davenport played mixed doubles at Wimbledon with Bob Bryan, where they received a wild card. They made it to the second round before falling to Daniel Nestor and Bethanie Mattek-Sands.

Davenport also announced her intention to play doubles at two tournaments in the American hard-court season. The first tournament was the women&#x27;s doubles event at the 2010 Bank of the West Classic, where she won the title partnering Liezel Huber. She followed this with the 2010 Mercury Insurance Open, again with Huber. They lost in the quarterfinals to Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Yan Zi.

===2011===
At the 2011 French Open she won the Women&#x27;s Legends Doubles event with partner Martina Hingis.
Davenport went on to win the Wimbledon Invitational Doubles event, partnering once again with Hingis. World Team Tennis announced that Davenport would not be able to compete for the season because she was pregnant with her third child.

==World TeamTennis==
Davenport has played 11 seasons with World TeamTennis starting in 1993 when she debuted in the league with the Sacramento Capitals and proceeded to win three championships with the team in 1997, 1998 and 2007. She also played with the St. Louis Aces in 2001, 2010 and 2011; New York Buzz in 2002; Newport Beach Breakers 2003 and 2008; Sacramento Capitals in 1993, 1997, 1998 and 2007 and the Orange County Breakers in 2012.

Davenport won multiple league honors during her WTT career including Female MVP 1997 and 2010; Women&#x27;s Singles scoring leader 1997, 1998; Female Rookie of the Year 1993; Mixed Doubles scoring leader 1998 (w/ Brian MacPhie).

==Playing style==
Davenport was an aggressive baseliner, whose game was built around her powerful serve and groundstrokes, which were used to dominate play, and hit winners both crosscourt and down-the-line. Due to her aggressive and risky playing style, she typically hit large numbers of both winners and unforced errors. Gabriela Sabatini once commented that, &quot;[Lindsay] likes to hit the ball hard into the corner. Very, very hard&quot;. She would typically utilise aggressive serve/groundstroke combinations to finish points quickly, and, by aiming for the corners and the lines, Davenport was able to dictate play from the baseline. Davenport has been described as one of the cleanest ball strikers in WTA history, as well as one of the most powerful; in 2021, Serena Williams described Davenport in retrospect as the &quot;hardest&quot; hitter she had ever faced, and the most &quot;powerful&quot; player of all time. Davenport possessed an exceptionally powerful first serve, which peaked at , allowing her to serve multiple aces in any given match. She also possessed powerful and effective kick and slice serves, which she deployed as second serves; these prevented double faults, and allowed her to dictate play from a defensive position. She was known for her forehand, which was hit flat with an Eastern forehand grip, affording consistent depth, power, and penetration; Gigi Fernández once remarked that Davenport has developed &quot;a forehand as good as Steffi Graf&#x27;s.&quot; She was also known for her powerful two-handed backhand, which was similarly hit hard and flat. Her lack of court speed and mobility was her greatest weakness throughout her career, until she overhauled her conditioning program and lost 30 pounds beginning in 1995; she was also known for her mental strength. She was a thirteen-time grand slam finalist in doubles, although she typically only approached the net in singles matches to retrieve short balls, or to finish a point when she had created an opportunity to attack with her powerful overhead smash. Throughout her career, Davenport rarely used defensive shots, instead predicating her game on pure power and aggression.

==Equipment and endorsements==
Davenport was endorsed by Nike for clothing, shoes, and on-court apparel. She was also endorsed by Wilson for racquets throughout her career, typically utilising a racquet from the Wilson Hammer range.

==Coaching==
Davenport became the coach of Madison Keys prior to the commencement of the 2015 season. Already the pair have made an impact together, with Keys advancing to the semi-finals of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time at the 2015 Australian Open, where she upset reigning Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitová en route.

==Personal life==
Davenport married Jon Leach, a Merrill Lynch investment banker and former University of Southern California All-American tennis player, on April 25, 2003, in Hawaii. He is the brother of her former coach Rick Leach. Davenport took a break from competitive tennis in late 2006 and much of 2007 to have a baby. In 2007, she gave birth to a son, Jagger Leach, in Newport Beach, California. She gave birth to a daughter in 2009 also in Newport Beach, California. She gave birth to her third child, a daughter, in 2012. The couple&#x27;s fourth child (and third daughter) was born in 2014. She owns homes in the Irvine, California, neighborhood of Shady Canyon, in Laguna Beach, California, and in Kona, Hawaii.

Jagger Leach made his Major debut in the juniors tournament at the 2024 Australian Open. Jagger Leach reached the quarter-finals of the juniors tournament at Wimbledon 2024.

<text>Charon ( or ), or (134340) Pluto I, is the largest of the five known natural satellites of the dwarf planet Pluto. It has a mean radius of . Charon is the sixth-largest known trans-Neptunian object after Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Gonggong. It was discovered in 1978 at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., using photographic plates taken at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS).

With half the diameter and one-eighth the mass of Pluto, Charon is a very large moon in comparison to its parent body. Its gravitational influence is such that the barycenter of the Plutonian system lies outside Pluto, and the two bodies are tidally locked to each other. The dwarf planet systems Pluto–Charon and Eris–Dysnomia are the only known examples of mutual tidal locking in the Solar System, though it is likely that –Vanth is another.

The reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins, organic macromolecules that may be essential ingredients of life. These tholins were produced from methane, nitrogen, and related gases which may have been released by cryovolcanic eruptions on the moon, or may have been transferred over from the atmosphere of Pluto to the orbiting moon.

The &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft is the only probe that has visited the Pluto system. It approached Charon to within in 2015.

==Discovery==

Charon was discovered by United States Naval Observatory astronomer James Christy, using the telescope at United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS). On June 22, 1978, he had been examining highly magnified images of Pluto on photographic plates taken with the telescope two months prior. Christy noticed that a slight elongation appeared periodically. The bulge was confirmed on plates dating back to April 29, 1965. Subsequent observations of Pluto determined that the bulge was due to a smaller accompanying body. The periodicity of the bulge corresponded to Pluto&#x27;s rotation period, which was previously known from Pluto&#x27;s light curve. This indicated a synchronous orbit, which strongly suggested that the bulge effect was real and not spurious. This resulted in reassessments of Pluto&#x27;s size, mass, and other physical characteristics because the calculated mass and albedo of the Pluto–Charon system had previously been attributed to Pluto alone. The International Astronomical Union formally announced Christy&#x27;s discovery to the world on July 7, 1978.

Doubts about Charon&#x27;s existence were erased when it and Pluto entered a five-year period of mutual eclipses and transits between 1985 and 1990. This occurs when the Pluto–Charon orbital plane is edge-on as seen from Earth, which only happens at two intervals in Pluto&#x27;s 248-year orbital period. It was fortuitous that one of these intervals happened to occur soon after Charon&#x27;s discovery.

==Name==
Charon was first given the temporary designation S/1978 P 1, after its discovery, following the then recently instituted convention. On June 24, 1978, Christy first suggested the name &quot;Charon&quot; as a scientific-sounding version of his wife Charlene&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Char&quot;. Although colleagues at the Naval Observatory proposed &quot;Persephone&quot;, Christy stuck with &quot;Charon&quot; after discovering that it was serendipitously the name of an appropriate mythological figure: Charon (; ) is the ferryman of the dead, closely associated with the god Pluto. The IAU officially adopted the name in late 1985, and it was announced on January 3, 1986.

Coincidentally, nearly four decades before Charon&#x27;s discovery, science fiction author Edmond Hamilton had invented three moons of Pluto for his 1940 novel &quot;Calling Captain Future&quot; and named them Charon, Styx, and Cerberus;
Styx and Kerberos are the two smallest Plutonian moons, and were named in 2013.

There is minor debate over the preferred pronunciation of the name. The mythological figure is pronounced with a sound, and this is often followed for the moon as well. However, Christy himself pronounced the initial as a sound, as he had named the moon after his wife Charlene. Many English-speaking astronomers follow the classical convention, but others follow Christy&#x27;s, and that is the prescribed pronunciation at NASA and of the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team.

==Orbit==

Charon and Pluto orbit each other every 6.387 days. The two objects are gravitationally locked to one another, so each keeps the same face towards the other. This is a case of mutual tidal locking, as compared to that of the Earth and the Moon, where the Moon always shows the same face to Earth, but not vice versa. The average distance between Charon and Pluto is . The discovery of Charon allowed astronomers to calculate accurately the mass of the Plutonian system, and mutual occultations revealed their sizes. However, neither indicated the two bodies&#x27; individual masses. Those could only be estimated, until the discovery of Pluto&#x27;s outer moons in late 2005. Details in the orbits of the outer moons then revealed that Charon has approximately 12% of the mass of Pluto.

== Formation ==
Simulation work published in 2005 by Robin Canup suggested that Charon could have been formed by a collision around 4.5 billion years ago, much like Earth and the Moon. In this model, a large Kuiper belt object struck Pluto at high velocity, destroying itself and blasting off much of Pluto&#x27;s outer mantle, and Charon coalesced from the debris. However, such an impact should result in an icier Charon and rockier Pluto than scientists have found. It is now thought that Pluto and Charon might have been two bodies that collided before going into orbit around each other. The collision would have been violent enough to boil off volatile ices like methane () but not violent enough to have destroyed either body. The very similar density of Pluto and Charon implies that the parent bodies were not fully differentiated when the impact occurred. The two bodies would have been stuck for a while, before separating from each other again, while remaining gravitationally bound. The internal heat in both bodies, created from both the collision and then the tidal friction as they separated, would have been sufficient to create Pluto&#x27;s subsurface ocean without the need for radioactive elements.

==Physical characteristics==


Charon&#x27;s diameter is , just over half that of Pluto. Larger than the dwarf planet Ceres, it is the twelfth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System. Charon is even similar in size to Uranus&#x27;s moons Umbriel and Ariel. Charon&#x27;s slow rotation means that there should be little flattening or tidal distortion if Charon is sufficiently massive to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Any deviation from a perfect sphere is too small to have been detected by observations by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission. This is in contrast to Iapetus, a Saturnian moon similar in size to Charon but with a pronounced oblateness dating to early in its history. The lack of such oblateness in Charon could mean that it is currently in hydrostatic equilibrium, or simply that its orbit approached its current one early in its history, when it was still warm.

Based on mass updates from observations made by &quot;New Horizons&quot; the mass ratio of Charon to Pluto is 0.1218:1. This is much larger than the Moon to the Earth: 0.0123:1. Because of the high mass ratio, the barycenter is outside of the radius of Pluto, and the Pluto–Charon system has been referred to as a dwarf double planet. With four smaller satellites in orbit about the two larger worlds, the Pluto–Charon system has been considered in studies of the orbital stability of circumbinary planets.

=== Internal structure ===

Charon&#x27;s volume and mass allow calculation of its density, , from which it can be determined that Charon is slightly less dense than Pluto and suggesting a composition of 55% rock to 45% ice (± 5%), whereas Pluto is about 70% rock. The difference is considerably lower than that of most suspected collisional satellites.

Following the &quot;New Horizons&quot; flyby, numerous discovered features on Charon&#x27;s surface strongly indicated that Charon is differentiated, and may even have had a subsurface ocean early in its history. The past resurfacing observed on Charon&#x27;s surface indicated that Charon&#x27;s ancient subsurface ocean may have fed large-scale cryoeruptions on the surface, erasing many older features. As a result, two broad competing views on the nature of Charon&#x27;s interior arose: the so-called &quot;hot start&quot; model, where Charon&#x27;s formation is rapid and involves a violent impact with Pluto, and the &quot;cold start&quot; model, where Charon&#x27;s formation is more gradual and involves a less violent impact with Pluto.

According to the hot start model, Charon accreted rapidly (within ~ years) from the circumplanetary disc, resulting from a highly-disruptive giant impact scenario. This rapid time scale prevents the heat from accretion from radiating away during the formation process, leading to the partial melting of Charon&#x27;s outer layers. However, Charon&#x27;s crust failed to reach a melt fraction where complete differentiation occurs, leading to the crust retaining part of its silicate content upon freezing. A liquid subsurface ocean forms during or soon after Charon&#x27;s accretion and persists for approximately 2 billion years before freezing, possibly driving cryovolcanic resurfacing of Vulcan Planitia. Radiogenic heat from Charon&#x27;s core could then melt a second subsurface ocean composed of a eutectic water-ammonia mixture before it too freezes, possibly driving the formation of Kubrick Mons and other similar features. These freezing cycles could increase Charon&#x27;s size by &gt;20 km, leading to the formation of the complex tectonic features observed in Serenity Chasma and Oz Terra.

In contrast, the cold start model argues that a large subsurface ocean early in Charon&#x27;s history is not necessary to explain Charon&#x27;s surface features, and instead proposes that Charon may have been homogeneous and more porous at formation. According to the cold start model, as Charon&#x27;s interior begins to warm due to radiogenic heating and heating from serpentinization, a phase of contraction begins, largely driven by compaction in Charon&#x27;s interior. Approximately 100-200 million years after formation, enough heat builds up to where a subsurface ocean melts, leading to rapid differentiation, further contraction, and the hydration of core rocks. Despite this melting, a pristine crust of amorphous water ice on Charon remains. After this period, differentiation continues, but the core can no longer absorb more water, and thus freezing at the base of Charon&#x27;s mantle begins. This freezing drives a period of expansion until Charon&#x27;s core becomes warm enough to begin compaction, starting a final period of contraction. Serenity Chasma may have formed from the expansion episode, whilst the final contraction episode may have given rise to the arcuate ridges observed in Mordor Macula.

=== Surface ===

Unlike Pluto&#x27;s surface, which is composed of nitrogen and methane ices, Charon&#x27;s surface appears to be dominated by the less volatile water ice.

In 2007, observations by the Gemini Observatory detected patches of ammonia hydrates and water crystals on the surface of Charon that suggested the presence of active cryogeysers and cryovolcanoes. The fact that the ice was still in crystalline form suggested it may have been deposited recently, as it was expected that solar radiation would have degraded it to an amorphous state after roughly thirty thousand years. However, following new data from the &quot;New Horizons&quot; flyby, no active cryovolcanoes or geysers were detected. Later research has also called into question the cryovolcanic origin for the crystalline water ice and ammonia features, with some researchers instead proposing that ammonia may be replenished passively from underground material.

Photometric mapping of Charon&#x27;s surface shows a latitudinal trend in albedo, with a bright equatorial band and darker poles. The north polar region is dominated by a very large dark area informally dubbed &quot;Mordor&quot; by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; team. The favored explanation for this feature is that it is formed by condensation of gases that escaped from Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere. In winter, the temperature is −258 °C, and these gases, which include nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane, condense into their solid forms; when these ices are subjected to solar radiation, they chemically react to form various reddish tholins. Later, when the area is again heated by the Sun as Charon&#x27;s seasons change, the temperature at the pole rises to −213 °C, resulting in the volatiles sublimating and escaping Charon, leaving only the tholins behind. Over millions of years, the residual tholin builds up thick layers, obscuring the icy crust. In addition to Mordor, &quot;New Horizons&quot; found evidence of extensive past geology that suggests that Charon is probably differentiated; in particular, the southern hemisphere has fewer craters than the northern and is considerably less rugged, suggesting that a massive resurfacing event—perhaps prompted by the partial or complete freezing of an internal ocean—occurred at some point in the past and removed many of the earlier craters.

Charon has a system of extensive grabens and scarps, such as Serenity Chasma, which extend as an equatorial belt for at least . Argo Chasma potentially reaches as deep as , with cliffs that may rival Verona Rupes on Miranda for the title of the tallest cliff in the Solar System.

=== Hypothesized exosphere ===

In contrast to Pluto, Charon has no significant atmosphere. There has been speculation about an extremely thin exosphere surrounding the moon contributing to the formation of dark regions such as Mordor Macula. The strong seasons experienced by Pluto and Charon could provide brief periods of exosphere formation as methane sublimates on Charon, interspersed by centuries of dormancy.

Pluto does have a thin but significant atmosphere, which Charon&#x27;s gravitation might pull toward Charon&#x27;s surface. The gas, specifically nitrogen, is mostly caught in the combined center of gravity between the two bodies before reaching Charon, but any gas that does reach Charon is held closely against the surface. The gas is mostly made up of ions of nitrogen, but the amounts are negligible compared to the total of Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere.

The many spectral signatures of ice formations on the surface of Charon have led some to believe that the ice formations could supply an atmosphere, but atmosphere supplying formations have not been confirmed yet. Many scientists theorize that these ice formations could be concealed out of direct sight, either in deep craters or beneath Charon&#x27;s surface. Charon&#x27;s relatively low gravity, due to its low mass, causes any atmosphere that might be present to rapidly escape the surface into space. Even through stellar occultation, which is used to probe the atmosphere of stellar bodies, scientists cannot confirm an existing atmosphere; this was tested in 1986 while attempting to perform stellar occultation testing on Pluto. Charon also acts as a protector for Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere, blocking the solar wind that would normally collide with Pluto and damage its atmosphere. Since Charon blocks these solar winds, its own atmosphere is diminished, instead of Pluto&#x27;s. This effect is also a potential explanation for Charon&#x27;s lack of atmosphere; the solar winds remove gases faster than they can accumulate. It is still possible for Charon to have an atmosphere, as Pluto transfers some of its atmospheric gas to Charon, from where it tends to escape into space. Assuming Charon&#x27;s density is 1.71 g/cm3, it would have a surface gravity of 0.6 of Pluto&#x27;s. It also has a higher mean molecular weight than Pluto and a lower exobase surface temperature, so that the gases in its atmosphere would not escape as rapidly from Charon as they do from Pluto.

There has been significant proof of CO2 gas and H2O vapor on the surface of Charon, but these vapors are not sufficient for a viable atmosphere due to their low vapor pressures. Pluto&#x27;s surface has abundant ice formations, but these are volatile, as they are made up of volatile substances like methane. These volatile ice structures cause a good deal of geological activity, keeping its atmosphere constant, while Charon&#x27;s ice structures are mainly made up of water and carbon dioxide, much less volatile substances that can stay dormant and not affect the atmosphere much.

==Observation and exploration==

Since the first blurred images of the moon , images showing Pluto and Charon resolved into separate disks were taken for the first time by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 1990s . The telescope was responsible for the best, yet low-quality images of the moon. In 1994, the clearest picture of the Pluto–Charon system showed two distinct and well-defined disks . The image was taken by Hubble&#x27;s Faint Object Camera (FOC) when the system was 4.4 billion kilometers (2.6 billion miles) away from Earth Later, the development of adaptive optics made it possible to resolve Pluto and Charon into separate disks using ground-based telescopes. Although ground-based observation is very challenging, a group of amateur astronomers in Italy used a 14-inch telescope in 2008 to successfully resolve Charon in an image of Pluto.

In June 2015, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft captured consecutive images of the Pluto–Charon system as it approached it. The images were put together in an animation. It was the best image of Charon to that date . In July 2015, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft made its closest approach to the Pluto system. It is the only spacecraft to date to have visited and studied Charon. Charon&#x27;s discoverer James Christy and the children of Clyde Tombaugh were guests at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory during the New Horizons closest approach.

== Classification ==

The center of mass (barycenter) of the Pluto–Charon system lies outside either body. Because neither object truly orbits the other, and Charon has 12.2% of the mass of Pluto, it has been argued that Charon should be considered to be part of a binary planet with Pluto. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) states that Charon is a satellite of Pluto, but the idea that Charon might be classified as a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date.

In a draft proposal for the 2006 redefinition of the term, the IAU proposed that a planet is defined as a body that orbits the Sun that is large enough for gravitational forces to render the object (nearly) spherical. Under this proposal, Charon would have been classified as a planet, because the draft explicitly defined a planetary satellite as one in which the barycenter lies within the major body. In the final definition, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet, but a formal definition of a planetary satellite was not decided upon. Charon is not in the list of dwarf planets currently recognized by the IAU. Had the draft proposal been accepted, even the Moon would hypothetically be classified as a planet in billions of years when the tidal acceleration that is gradually moving the Moon away from Earth takes it far enough away that the center of mass of the system no longer lies within Earth.

The other moons of Pluto Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx orbit the same barycenter but they are not large enough to be spherical and they are simply considered to be satellites of Pluto (or of Pluto–Charon).

<text>A Kirkwood gap is a gap or dip in the distribution of the semi-major axes (or equivalently of the orbital periods) of the orbits of main-belt asteroids. They correspond to the locations of orbital resonances with Jupiter. The gaps were first noticed in 1866 by Daniel Kirkwood, who also correctly explained their origin in the orbital resonances with Jupiter while a professor at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

For example, there are very few asteroids with semimajor axis near 2.50 AU, period 3.95 years, which would make three orbits for each orbit of Jupiter (hence, called the 3:1 orbital resonance). Other orbital resonances correspond to orbital periods whose lengths are simple fractions of Jupiter&#x27;s. The weaker resonances lead only to a depletion of asteroids, while spikes in the histogram are often due to the presence of a prominent asteroid family &quot;(see List of asteroid families)&quot;.

Most of the Kirkwood gaps are depleted, unlike the mean-motion resonances (MMR) of Neptune or Jupiter&#x27;s 3:2 resonance, that retain objects captured during the giant planet migration of the Nice model. The loss of objects from the Kirkwood gaps is due to the overlapping of the ν5 and ν6 secular resonances within the mean-motion resonances. The orbital elements of the asteroids vary chaotically as a result and evolve onto planet-crossing orbits within a few million years. The 2:1 MMR has a few relatively stable islands within the resonance, however. These islands are depleted due to slow diffusion onto less stable orbits. This process, which has been linked to Jupiter and Saturn being near a 5:2 resonance, may have been more rapid when Jupiter&#x27;s and Saturn&#x27;s orbits were closer together.

More recently, a relatively small number of asteroids have been found to possess high eccentricity orbits which do lie within the Kirkwood gaps. Examples include the Alinda and Griqua groups. These orbits slowly increase their eccentricity on a timescale of tens of millions of years, and will eventually break out of the resonance due to close encounters with a major planet. This is why asteroids are rarely found in the Kirkwood gaps.

==Main gaps==
The most prominent Kirkwood gaps are located at mean orbital radii of:
* 1.780 AU (5:1 resonance)
* 2.065 AU (4:1 resonance)
* 2.502 AU (3:1 resonance), home to the Alinda group of asteroids
* 2.825 AU (5:2 resonance)
* 2.958 AU (7:3 resonance)
* 3.279 AU (2:1 resonance), Hecuba gap, home to the Griqua group of asteroids.
* 3.972 AU (3:2 resonance), home to the Hilda asteroids.
* 4.296 AU (4:3 resonance), home to the Thule group of asteroids.

Weaker and/or narrower gaps are also found at:
* 1.909 AU (9:2 resonance)
* 2.258 AU (7:2 resonance)
* 2.332 AU (10:3 resonance)
* 2.706 AU (8:3 resonance)
* 3.031 AU (9:4 resonance)
* 3.077 AU (11:5 resonance)
* 3.474 AU (11:6 resonance)
* 3.517 AU (9:5 resonance)
* 3.584 AU (7:4 resonance), home to the Cybele asteroids
* 3.702 AU (5:3 resonance).

==Asteroid zones==
The gaps are not seen in a simple snapshot of the locations of the asteroids at any one time because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.

The main gaps occur at the 3:1, 5:2, 7:3, and 2:1 mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. An asteroid in the 3:1 Kirkwood gap would orbit the Sun three times for each Jovian orbit, for instance. Weaker resonances occur at other semi-major axis values, with fewer asteroids found than nearby. (For example, an 8:3 resonance for asteroids with a semi-major axis of 2.71 AU).

The main or core population of the asteroid belt may be divided into the inner and outer zones, separated by the 3:1 Kirkwood gap at 2.5 AU, and the outer zone may be further divided into middle and outer zones by the 5:2 gap at 2.82 AU:

* 4:1 resonance (2.06 AU)
** Zone I population (inner zone)
* 3:1 resonance (2.5 AU) 
** Zone II population (middle zone)

<doc id="52840" wikidata="Q2493809" url="?curid=52840" title="Tom Swift">
<text>Tom Swift is the main character of six series of American juvenile science fiction and adventure novels that emphasize science, invention, and technology. Inaugurated in 1910, the sequence of series comprises more than 100 volumes. The first Tom Swift – later, Tom Swift Sr. – was created by Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book packaging firm. Tom&#x27;s adventures have been written by various ghostwriters, beginning with Howard Garis. Most of the books are credited to the collective pseudonym &quot;Victor Appleton&quot;. The 33 volumes of the second series use the pseudonym Victor Appleton II for the author. For this series, and some later ones, the main character is &quot;Tom Swift Jr.&quot; New titles have been published again from 2019 after a gap of about ten years, roughly the time that has passed before every resumption. Most of the series emphasized Tom&#x27;s inventions. The books generally describe the effects of science and technology as wholly beneficial, and the role of the inventor in society as admirable and heroic.

Translated into many languages, the books have sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. Tom Swift has also been the subject of a board game and several attempted adaptations into other media.

Tom Swift has been cited as an inspiration by various scientists and inventors, including aircraft designer Kelly Johnson.

== Inventions ==
In his various incarnations, Tom Swift, usually a teenager, is inventive and science-minded, &quot;Swift by name and swift by nature.&quot; Tom is portrayed as a natural genius. In the earlier series, he is said to have had little formal education, the character modeled originally after such inventors as Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, aviation pioneer Glenn Curtiss and Alberto Santos-Dumont. For most of the six series, each book concerns Tom&#x27;s latest invention, and its role either in solving a problem or mystery, or in assisting Tom in feats of exploration or rescue. Often Tom must protect his new invention from villains &quot;intent on stealing Tom&#x27;s thunder or preventing his success,&quot; but Tom is always successful in the end.

Many of Tom Swift&#x27;s fictional inventions describe actual technological developments or predate technologies now considered commonplace. &quot;Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers&quot; (1911) was based on Charles Parsons&#x27;s attempts to synthesize diamonds using electric current. &quot;Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone&quot; was published in 1914. Sending photographs by telephone was not fully developed until 1925. &quot;Tom Swift and His Wizard Camera&quot; (1912) features a portable movie camera, not invented until 1923. &quot;Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive&quot; (1922) was published two years before the Central Railroad of New Jersey began using the first diesel electric locomotive. The house on wheels that Tom invents for 1929&#x27;s &quot;Tom Swift and His House on Wheels&quot; pre-dated the first house trailer by a year. &quot;Tom Swift and His Diving Seacopter&quot; (1952) features a flying submarine similar to one planned by the United States Department of Defense four years later in 1956. Other inventions of Tom&#x27;s have not happened, such as the device for silencing airplane engines that he invents in &quot;Tom Swift and His Magnetic Silencer&quot; (1941).

== Authorship ==
The character of Tom Swift was conceived about 1910 by Edward Stratemeyer, founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, a book-packaging business, although the name &quot;Tom Swift&quot; was first used in 1903 by Stratemeyer in &quot;Shorthand Tom the Reporter; Or, the Exploits of a Bright Boy&quot;. Stratemeyer invented the series to capitalize on the market for children&#x27;s science adventures. The Syndicate&#x27;s authors created the Tom Swift stories by first preparing an outline with the plot elements, followed by drafting and editing the detailed manuscript. The books were published using the house pseudonym &quot;Victor Appleton&quot;. Howard Garis wrote most of the volumes of the original series; Stratemeyer&#x27;s daughter, Harriet Stratemeyer Adams, wrote the last three volumes. The first &quot;Tom Swift&quot; series ended in 1941.

In 1954, Harriet Adams created the &quot;Tom Swift, Jr.&quot; series, which was published using the pseudonym &quot;Victor Appleton II&quot; as author. The main character Tom Swift, Junior, was described as the son of the original Tom Swift. Most of the stories were outlined and plotted by Adams. The texts were written by various writers, among them William Dougherty, John Almquist, Richard Sklar, James Duncan Lawrence, Tom Mulvey and Richard McKenna. The &quot;Tom Swift, Jr.&quot;, series ended in 1971.

A third series was begun in 1981 and lasted until 1984. The rights to the Tom Swift character, along with the Stratemeyer Syndicate, were sold in 1984 to publishers Simon &amp; Schuster. They hired New York City book packaging business Mega-Books to produce further series. Simon &amp; Schuster has published three more Tom Swift series: one from 1991 to 1993;&quot;Tom Swift, Young Inventor&quot; from 2006 to 2007; and &quot;Tom Swift Inventors Academy&quot; from 2019 to present—eight volumes as of &quot;Depth Perception&quot; (March 2022).

== Series ==

The longest-running series of books to feature Tom Swift is the first, which consists of 40 volumes. Tom&#x27;s son (Tom Swift Jr.) was also the name of the protagonist of the 33 volumes of the Tom Swift Jr. Adventures, the 11 volumes of the third Tom Swift series, the 13 volumes of the fourth, and a half-dozen more for the most recent series, Tom Swift, Young Inventor, for a total of 103 volumes for all the series. In addition to publication in the United States, Tom Swift books have been published extensively in England, and translated into Norwegian, French, Icelandic, and Finnish.

=== Original series (1910–1941) ===

In the original series, Tom Swift lives in fictional Shopton, New York. He is the son of Barton Swift, the founder of the Swift Construction Company. Tom&#x27;s mother is deceased, but the housekeeper, Mrs. Baggert, functions as a surrogate mother. Tom usually shares his adventures with close friend Ned Newton, who eventually becomes the Swift Construction Company&#x27;s financial manager. For most of the series, Tom dates Mary Nestor. It has been suggested that his eventual marriage to Mary led to the series&#x27; demise, as young boys found a married man harder to identify with than a young, single one; however, after the 1929 marriage the series continued for 12 more years and eight further volumes. Regularly appearing characters include Wakefield Damon, an older man, whose dialogue is characterized by frequent use of such whimsical expressions as &quot;Bless my brakeshoes!&quot; and &quot;Bless my vest buttons!&quot;

The original Tom Swift has been claimed to represent the early 20th-century conception of inventors. Tom has no formal education after high school; according to critic Robert Von der Osten, Tom&#x27;s ability to invent is presented as &quot;somehow innate&quot;. Tom is not a theorist but a tinkerer and, later, an experimenter who, with his research team, finds practical applications for others&#x27; research; Tom does not so much methodically develop and perfect inventions as find them by trial and error.

Tom&#x27;s inventions are not at first innovative. In the first two books of the series, he fixes a motorcycle and a boat, and in the third book he develops an airship, but only with the help of a balloonist. Tom is also at times unsure of himself, asking his elders for help; as Von der Osten puts it, &quot;the early Tom Swift is more dependent on his father and other adults at first and is much more hesitant in his actions. When his airship bangs into a tower, Tom is uncharacteristically nonplussed and needs support.&quot; However, as the series progresses, Tom&#x27;s inventions &quot;show an increasingly independent genius as he develops devices, such as an electric rifle and a photo telephone, further removed from the scientific norm&quot;. Some of Tom&#x27;s inventions are improvements of then-current technologies, while other inventions were not in development at the time the books were published, but have since been developed.

=== Second series (1954–1971) ===


In this series, presented as an extension and continuation of the first, the Tom Swift of the original series is now the CEO of Swift Enterprises, a four-mile-square enclosed facility where inventions are conceived and manufactured. Tom&#x27;s son, Tom Swift Jr., is now the primary inventive genius of the family. Stratemeyer Syndicate employee Andrew Svenson described the new series as based &quot;on scientific fact and probability, whereas the old Toms were in the main adventure stories mixed with pseudo-science&quot;. Three PhDs in science were hired as consultants to the series to ensure scientific accuracy. The younger Tom does not tinker with motorcycles; his inventions and adventures extend from deep within the Earth (in &quot;Tom Swift and His Atomic Earth Blaster&quot; [1954]) to the bottom of the ocean (in &quot;Tom Swift and His Diving Seacopter&quot; [1956]) to the Moon (in &quot;Tom Swift in the Race to the Moon&quot; [1958]) and, eventually, the outer Solar System (in &quot;Tom Swift and His Cosmotron Express&quot; [1970]). Later volumes of the series increasingly emphasized the extraterrestrial &quot;space friends&quot;, as they are termed throughout the series. The beings appear as early as the first volume of the series, &quot;Tom Swift and His Flying Lab&quot; (1954). The Tom Swift Jr., Adventures were less commercially successful than the first series, selling 6 million copies total, compared with sales of 14 million copies for the first series.

In contrast to the earlier series, many of Tom Jr.&#x27;s inventions are designed to operate in space, and his &quot;genius is unequivocally original as he constructs nuclear-powered flying labs, establishes outposts in space, or designs ways to sail in space on cosmic rays&quot;. Unlike his father, Tom Jr. is not just a tinkerer; he relies on scientific and mathematical theories, and, according to critic Robert Von der Osten, &quot;science [in the books] is, in fact, understood to be a set of theories that are developed based on experimentation and scientific discussion. Rather than being opposed to technological advances, such a theoretical understanding becomes essential to invention.&quot;

Tom Swift Jr.&#x27;s Cold War-era adventures and inventions are often motivated by patriotism, as Tom repeatedly defeats the evil agents of the fictional nations &quot;Kranjovia&quot; and &quot;Brungaria&quot;, the latter a place that critic Francis Molson describes as &quot;a vaguely Eastern European country, which is strongly opposed to the Swifts and the U.S. Hence, the Swifts&#x27; opposition to and competition with the Brungarians is both personal and patriotic.&quot;

=== Third series (1981–1984) ===
The third Tom Swift series differs from the first two in that the setting is primarily outer space, although Swift Enterprises (located now in New Mexico) is occasionally mentioned. Tom Swift explores the universe in the starship &quot;Exedra&quot;, using a faster-than-light drive he has reverse-engineered from an alien space probe. He is aided by Benjamin Franklin Walking Eagle, a Native American who is Tom&#x27;s co-pilot, best friend, and an expert computer technician, and Anita Thorwald, a former rival of Tom&#x27;s who now works with him as a technician and whose right leg has been rebuilt to contain a miniature computer.

This series maintains only an occasional and vague continuity with the two previous series. Tom is called the son of &quot;the great Tom Swift&quot; and said to be &quot;already an important and active contributor to the family business, the giant multimillion-dollar scientific-industrial complex known as Swift Enterprises&quot;. However, as critic Francis Molson indicates, it is not explained whether this Tom Swift is the grandson of the famous Tom Swift of the first series or still the Tom Swift Jr. of the second.

The Tom Swift of this third series is less of an inventor than his predecessors, and his inventions are rarely the main feature of the plot. Still, according to Molson, &quot;Tom the inventor is not ignored. Perhaps the most impressive of his inventions and the one essential to the series as a whole is the robot he designs and builds, Aristotle, which becomes a winning and likeable character in its own right.&quot; The books are slower-paced than the Tom Swift Jr. adventures of the second series, and include realistic, colloquial dialogue. Each volume begins where the last one ended, and the technology is plausible and accurate.

=== Fourth series (1991–1993) ===
The fourth series featuring Tom Swift (again a &quot;Jr.&quot;) is set mostly on Earth (with occasional voyages to the Moon); Swift Enterprises is now located in California. In the first book, &quot;The Black Dragon&quot;, it&#x27;s mentioned that Tom is the son of Tom Swift Sr. and Mary Nestor. The books deal with what Richard Pyle describes as &quot;modern and futuristic concepts&quot; and, as in the third series, feature an ethnically diverse cast of characters.

Like the Tom Swift Jr. series, the series portrays Tom as a scientist as well as an inventor whose inventions depend on a knowledge of theory. The series differs from previous versions of the character, however, in that Tom&#x27;s inventive genius is portrayed as problematic and sometimes dangerous. As Robert Von der Osten argues, Tom&#x27;s inventions for this series often have unexpected and negative repercussions.
a device to create a miniature black hole which casts him into an alternative universe; a device that trains muscles but also distorts the mind of the user; and a genetic process which, combined with the effect of his black hole, results in a terrifying devolution. Genius here begins to recapitulate earlier myths of the mad scientist whose technological and scientific ambitions are so out of harmony with nature and contemporary science that the results are usually unfortunate.
The series features more violence than previous series; in &quot;The Negative Zone&quot;, Tom blows up a motel room to escape the authorities.

There was a derivative of this series featuring Tom Swift and the Hardy Boys called &quot;A Hardy Boys &amp; Tom Swift Ultra Thriller&quot; that was published from 1992 to 1993, and only had two volumes released. Both books dealt with science fictional topics (time travel and aliens landing on earth).

=== Fifth series (2006–2007) ===
The fifth series, &quot;Tom Swift, Young Inventor&quot;, returns Tom Swift to Shopton, New York, with Tom as the son of Tom Swift and Mary Nestor, the names of characters of the original Tom Swift series. The series features inventions that are close to current technology &quot;rather than ultra-futuristic&quot;. In several of the books, Tom&#x27;s antagonist is The Road Back (TRB), an anti-technology terrorist organization. Tom&#x27;s personal nemesis is Andy Foger, teenage son of his father&#x27;s former business partner who now owns a competing (and ethically dubious) high-technology company.

=== Sixth series (2019-2022) ===
A sixth series, &quot;Tom Swift Inventors&#x27; Academy&quot;, published by Simon and Schuster, debuted in July 2019 with #1 &quot;The Drone Pursuit&quot; and #2 &quot;The Sonic Breach&quot;. A total of eight books were published, concluding with #8 &quot;Depth Perception&quot; in March 2022.

== Other media ==
Parker Brothers produced a Tom Swift board game in 1966, although it was never widely distributed, and the character has appeared in one television show. Various Tom Swift radio programs, television series, and movies were planned and even written, but were either never produced or not released.

=== Film and television ===
==== Cancelled films ====
As early as 1914, Edward Stratemeyer proposed making a Tom Swift movie, but no such movie was made. A Tom Swift radio series was proposed in 1946. Two scripts were written, but, for unknown reasons, the series was never produced. Twentieth Century Fox planned a Tom Swift feature movie in 1968, to be directed by Gene Kelly. A script was written and approved, and filming was to have begun during 1969. However, the project was canceled owing to the poor reception of the movies &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; and &quot;Star!&quot;; a $500,000 airship that had been built as a prop was rumored to have been sold to a midwest amusement park. Yet another movie was planned in 1974, but, again, was cancelled.

==== Television ====

Scripts were written for a proposed television series involving both Tom Swift Jr. and his father, the hero of the original book series. A television pilot show for a series to be called &quot;The Adventures of Tom Swift&quot; was filmed in 1958, featuring Gary Vinson. However, legal problems prevented the pilot&#x27;s distribution, and it was never broadcast; no copies of the pilot are known to exist, though the pilot script is available. In 1977, Glen A. Larson wrote an unproduced television pilot show entitled &quot;TS, I Love You: The Further Adventures of Tom Swift&quot;. This series was to be combined with a Nancy Drew series, a Hardy Boys series, and a Dana Girls series. Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys were eventually combined into a one-hour program &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot; with alternating episodes.

A Tom Swift media project finally came to fruition in 1983 when Willie Aames appeared as Tom Swift along with Lori Loughlin as Linda Craig in a television special, &quot;The Tom Swift and Linda Craig Mystery Hour&quot;, which was broadcast on July 3. It was a ratings failure. In 2007, digital studio Worldwide Biggies acquired movie rights to Tom Swift and announced plans to release a feature film and video game, followed by a television series. As of 2015, these plans had not come to fruition.

Tom Swift appeared in the episode &quot;The Celestial Visitor&quot; from the second season of The CW&#x27;s &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; with Tian Richards portraying the character as a black, gay, billionaire inventor. The episode is a backdoor pilot for a spin-off project titled &quot;Tom Swift&quot;, in development at The CW. In August 2021, &quot;Tom Swift&quot; was ordered straight-to-series and premiered on May 31, 2022 on The CW. In February 2022, Ashleigh Murray joined the cast as Zenzi Fullington. Due to poor ratings, the series was cancelled on June 30 that year.

== Depiction of race ==
&quot;Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle&quot; (published 1911) depicts Africans as brutish, uncivilized animals, and the white protagonist as their paternal savior. 

== Cultural influence ==
The Tom Swift books have been credited with assisting the success of American science fiction and with establishing the edisonade (stories focusing on brilliant scientists and inventors) as a basic cultural myth. Tom Swift&#x27;s adventures have been popular since the character&#x27;s inception in 1910: by 1914, 150,000 copies a year were being sold and a 1929 study found the series to be second in popularity only to the Bible for boys in their early teens. By 2009, Tom Swift books had sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. The success of Tom Swift also paved the way for other Stratemeyer creations, such as The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew.

The series&#x27; writing style, which was sometimes adverb heavy, suggested a name for a type of adverbial pun promulgated during the 1950s and 1960s, a type of wellerism known as &quot;Tom Swifties&quot;. Originally this kind of pun was called a &quot;Tom Swiftly&quot; in reference to the adverbial usage. Over time, it has come to be called a &quot;Tom Swifty&quot;. Some examples are I lost my crutches,&#x27; said Tom lamely&quot;, and I&#x27;ll take the prisoner downstairs&#x27;, said Tom condescendingly.&quot;

Tom Swift&#x27;s fictional inventions have apparently inspired several actual inventions, among them Lee Felsenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tom Swift Terminal&quot;, which &quot;drove the creation of an early personal computer known as the Sol&quot;, and the taser. The name &quot;taser&quot; was originally &quot;TSER&quot;, for &quot;Tom Swift Electric Rifle&quot;. The invention was named for the central device in the story &quot;Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle&quot; (1911); according to inventor Jack Cover, &quot;an &#x27;A&#x27; was added because we got tired of answering the phone &#x27;TSER&#x27;.&quot;

A number of scientists, inventors, and science fiction writers have also credited Tom Swift with inspiring them, including Ray Kurzweil, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; author Margaret Mitchell was also known to have read the first series as a child. Filmmaker George Lucas shows the 16-year-old Indiana Jones reading a Tom Swift novel — and the author Edward Stratemeyer himself appearing as a character — in the episode &quot;Spring Break Adventure&quot; of the television series &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot;.

The Tom Swift Jr. series was also a source of inspiration to many. Scientist and television presenter Bill Nye said the books helped &quot;make me who I am&quot;, and they inspired him to launch his own young adult series. Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates also read the books as children, as did co-founder of competing company Apple, Steve Wozniak. Wozniak, who cited the series as his inspiration to become a scientist, said the books made him feel &quot;that engineers can save the world from all sorts of conflict and evil&quot;.

<text>Valve Corporation, also known as Valve Software, is an American video game developer, publisher, and digital distribution company headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. It is the developer of the software distribution platform Steam and the game franchises &quot;Half-Life&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;Portal&quot;, &quot;Day of Defeat&quot;, &quot;Team Fortress&quot;, &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; and &quot;Dota&quot;.

Valve was founded in 1996 by the former Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington. Their debut game, the first-person shooter (FPS) &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998), was a critical and commercial success and had a lasting influence on the FPS genre. Harrington left in 2000. In 2003, Valve launched Steam, followed by &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; (2004), the episodic sequels &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode One&quot; (2006) and &quot;Episode Two&quot; (2007), the multiplayer games &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; (2007) and &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; (2008), the puzzle games &quot;Portal&quot; (2007) and &quot;Portal 2&quot; (2011) and the multiplayer online battle arena game &quot;Dota 2&quot; (2013).

In the 2010s, Valve released fewer games and experimented with hardware and virtual reality (VR). They entered the hardware market in 2015 with the Steam Machine, a line of gaming computers, which sold poorly, and released the HTC Vive and Valve Index VR headsets. They returned to the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series in 2020 with &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;, their flagship VR game. In 2022, Valve released the Steam Deck, a portable gaming system.

Valve uses a flat structure, whereby employees decide what to work on themselves. They develop games through playtesting and iteration, describing game design as a kind of experimental psychology. By 2012, Valve employed around 250 people and was reportedly worth over US$3 billion. Most of Valve&#x27;s revenue comes from Steam, which controlled over half of the digital PC games market in 2011 and generated an estimated $3.4 billion in 2017.

== History ==

=== Founding and &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1996–2003) ===

Valve was founded in 1996 by the former Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington. Newell had spent the prior 13 years at Microsoft developing Windows, including the Windows 95 port of &quot;Doom&quot;. Wanting to move onto a new venture using their shared wealth, Newell and Harrington founded Valve, L.L.C. in Kirkland, Washington, about five miles from the Microsoft campus in Redmond, on August 24, 1996, Newell&#x27;s wedding day. In a break from industry style of the time, Newell did not want a company name that suggested &quot;testosterone-gorged muscles and the &#x27;extreme&#x27; of anything&quot;. Alternative names considered by Newell and Harrington include Hollow Box, Fruitfly Ensemble and Rhino Scar.

Valve&#x27;s first game was &quot;Half-Life&quot;, a first-person shooter (FPS) with elements of horror. The development was aided by access to the &quot;Quake&quot; engine by id Software; Valve modified this engine into their GoldSrc engine. After struggling to find a publisher, Valve eventually signed with Sierra On-Line.

&quot;Half-Life&quot; was released in November 1998 and was a critical and commercial success. With its realism, scripted sequences and seamless narrative, it had a lasting influence; according to &quot;IGN&quot; in 2014, the history of the FPS genre &quot;breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-&quot;Half-Life&quot; and post-&quot;Half-Life&quot; eras&quot;.

Valve enlisted Gearbox Software to develop three expansions for &quot;Half-Life&quot;: &quot;Opposing Force&quot; (1999), &quot;Blue Shift&quot; (2001) and &quot;Decay&quot; (2001). In 1998, Valve acquired TF Software, a group that had made the popular &quot;Team Fortress&quot; mod for &quot;Quake&quot;, and remade it for GoldSrc as &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot; in 1999. Valve released the software development kit (SDK) for the GoldSrc engine, facilitating numerous user-created mods. They acquired the developers of one popular mod, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, to create a standalone &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; game. Happy with Valve&#x27;s success, Harrington sold his stake in Valve to Newell in 2000.

Valve&#x27;s publishing agreement meant Sierra owned the &quot;Half-Life&quot; intellectual property and held exclusive publishing rights to future Valve games. In 2001, Valve renegotiated by threatening to cease game development and develop other software, using an offer of a partnership from Amazon to create a digital storefront as a bargaining chip. After the agreement with Sierra was amended, Valve gained the &quot;Half-Life&quot; intellectual property and online distribution rights for its games.

=== Source, Steam, and &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; (2003–2010) ===
In 2003, Valve moved to Bellevue, Washington, and reincorporated as Valve Corporation. In 2010, the office moved to a larger location in Bellevue. In 2016, Valve signed a nine-floor lease in the Lincoln Square complex in downtown Bellevue, doubling the size of its offices.

Valve began developing &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; six months after the release of the first &quot;Half-Life&quot;, using its new in-house engine, Source. With advanced physics systems and an increased focus on story and characters, it received critical acclaim upon its release in 2004. By 2011, it had sold 12 million copies. 

In 2002, Valve launched Steam, a digital storefront and delivery platform. Steam initially offered only Valve games, and was mandatory to install &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, but became a publisher of third-party games. As Valve became its own publisher via Steam, it transitioned to a flat organization. Outside of executive management, Valve does not have bosses and uses an open allocation system, allowing employees to move between departments at will.

After having taken five years to develop &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, Valve moved to episodic development, planning to release shorter games more frequently. &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode One&quot;, the first in a planned trilogy of episodic &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; sequels, was released in 2006. &quot;Episode Two&quot; followed in 2007, alongside the multiplayer game &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; and the puzzle game &quot;Portal&quot;, developed from the student project &quot;Narbacular Drop&quot;. In January 2008, Valve announced the acquisition of Turtle Rock Studios, which was renamed Valve South. Turtle Rock developed &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; and &quot;Left 4 Dead 2&quot; while associated with Valve. Turtle Rock Studios spun out of Valve again in March 2010. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Valve had grossed $70 million in 2005. 

=== Transition to services (2010–2014) ===

In 2009, Valve hired IceFrog, the developer of &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot;, a &quot;Warcraft III&quot; mod. IceFrog led the development of a sequel not associated with the &quot;Warcraft&quot; elements, &quot;Dota 2&quot;, released in 2013. Alongside &quot;Dota 2&quot; in 2011, Valve started the International, an annual esports tournament for &quot;Dota 2&quot; with a prize pool supported by Valve and funds from microtransactions from battle passes purchased by players. Valve released &quot;Portal 2&quot; in April 2011. As with the original &quot;Portal&quot;, Valve employed a Digipen student team to help develop it; the team behind &quot;&quot; implemented the new gel gameplay.

The Screen Digest analyst Ed Barton estimated Valve&#x27;s 2010 revenue to be in the &quot;high hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;. As of 2011, Valve had an estimated worth of $2 to 4 billion and employed 250 people; according to Newell, this made it more profitable per employee than Google or Apple. Most of Valve&#x27;s revenue came from Steam, which controlled 50 to 70% of the market for downloaded PC games in 2011.

By 2011, Valve had replaced episodic development with a platform-oriented approach, whereby games such as &quot;Left 4 Dead 2&quot; and &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; were continually updated through Steam updates. Valve hired the economist Yanis Varoufakis to study the online economies of their games in June 2012. That December, Valve acquired Star Filled Studios, a two-person studio, to open a San Francisco office. Valve closed the office in August 2013 when they decided it had little benefit. At the 2013 D.I.C.E. Summit, Newell announced that he and the film director J. J. Abrams were collaborating to produce a &quot;Half-Life&quot; or &quot;Portal&quot; film, as well as a possible game.

In the 2010s, Valve released fewer games and invested in hardware development. Newell intended to make Valve more like Nintendo, which develops games in tandem with hardware, allowing them to create innovative games such as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. Valve initially focused on augmented reality, but in 2013 Newell laid off many staff to focus on virtual reality (VR). In 2015, Valve released the Steam Machine, a line of gaming computers, which sold poorly. Media commentators speculated that Valve&#x27;s transition to service provider with Steam, which generated an estimated $3.4 billion in 2017, had driven it away from game development. 

Valve canceled games including numerous &quot;Half-Life&quot; projects (including &quot;Episode Three&quot;), &quot;Left 4 Dead 3&quot;, a Soulslike game, and a voxel-based game, &quot;A.R.T.I&quot;. Additional VR projects included &quot;SimTrek&quot;, developed by members of the &quot;Kerbal Space Program&quot; development team, and a new VR device, Vader, that was determined to be too costly for consumers. According to the designer Robin Walker, the abundance of projects that failed to gain traction, with no shared vision, damaged morale. Many players grew frustrated in anticipation of a new &quot;Half-Life&quot; game.

===Source 2, virtual reality and &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot; (2015–present)===
Valve announced the Source 2 engine in March 2015 and ported &quot;Dota 2&quot; to it that September. That year, Valve collaborated with the electronics company HTC to develop the HTC Vive, a VR headset released in 2016. Valve experimented with VR games, and in 2016 released &quot;The Lab&quot;, a collection of VR minigames.

Valve recognized that many players wanted a more ambitious VR AAA game, and began exploring the development of a major VR game. They developed several prototypes, with three further VR projects under development by 2017. Finding that the portal systems of their puzzle series &quot;Portal&quot; were disorienting in VR, they settled on &quot;Half-Life&quot;. Walker said that &quot;Half-Life 3&quot; had been a &quot;terrifyingly daunting prospect&quot;, and the team saw VR as a way to return to the series.

Full development of a VR &quot;Half-Life&quot; game started around late 2016, with the largest team in Valve&#x27;s history. Valve acquired the 3D audio software developer Impulsonic in January 2017. In April 2018, Valve acquired the independent developer Campo Santo, known for the 2016 adventure game &quot;Firewatch&quot;. Campo Santo planned to develop its own games under Valve, though they initially helped develop &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;.

In November 2018, Valve released &quot;Artifact&quot;, a digital collectible card game based on &quot;Dota 2&quot;, with design by Richard Garfield, the creator of &quot;&quot;. &quot;Artifact&quot; had unusual pay-for mechanics to acquire new cards, and did not draw a large playerbase, losing 95% of players months after release. In April 2021, Valve abandoned efforts to reboot the project, saying they had not found enough interested players to justify development. In June 2019, Valve released its second-generation VR hardware, the Valve Index. They also released &quot;Dota Underlords&quot; into early access, an auto battler based on a &quot;Dota 2&quot; community-created mode &quot;Dota Auto Chess&quot;. 

In March 2020, Valve released &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;, a VR game. It received acclaim and was described as VR&#x27;s first killer app. Newell said in January 2021 that the success of &quot;Alyx&quot; created desire within the company to develop more games, and that several were under development. Valve collaborated with Netflix for &quot;&quot;, an animated television series based on &quot;Dota&quot;, which premiered in March 2021. In February 2022, Valve released the Steam Deck, a portable game system that runs on SteamOS. In September 2023, Valve released &quot;Counter-Strike 2&quot;. It received generally favorable reviews, but player reception was mixed. 

In 2024, Valve began beta-testing a new multiplayer game, &quot;Deadlock&quot;, a combination of a hero shooter and MOBA. In September, staff members from Hopoo Games, developers of &quot;Risk of Rain&quot;, announced that they had been employed at Valve. According to a report by &quot;Forbes Australia&quot; published in December 2024, Valve had an annual revenue of $5 billion by 2023, with a 40% profit margin. Steam accounted for around 60% of this revenue, double that of 2019.

== Structure ==

Initially, Valve used a hierarchical structure more typical of other development firms, driven by the nature of physical game releases through publishers that required tasks to be completed by deadlines. However, as Valve became its own publisher via Steam, it found the hierarchical structure was hindering progress.

After completing &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, Valve transitioned to a flat organization; outside of executive management, Valve does not have bosses, and uses an open allocation system. Valve&#x27;s marketing manager, Doug Lombardi, said: &quot;Nobody writes a design doc and hands it to somebody and says, &#x27;you go build this&#x27;. It&#x27;s the teams that are coming up with the ideas and pushing in the directions that they want to take the product.&quot; This approach allows employees to work on whatever interests them, but requires them to take ownership of their product and mistakes they may make, according to Newell. Newell recognized that this structure works well for some but that &quot;there are plenty of great developers for whom this is a terrible place to work&quot;. Following the difficult development of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, Newell said he became &quot;obsessed&quot; with improving Valve&#x27;s work-life balance.

Although Valve has no bosses, some employees hold more influence due to seniority or relationships. De facto project leads became &quot;centralized conduits&quot; for organization and sharing information, and decisions are made collectively. Valve uses a process named Overwatch to gather feedback from senior members, which teams may use or ignore. 

The success of Steam means that Valve is not dependent on the success of its games. The lack of organization structure has led to project cancellations, as it can be difficult to convince other employees to work on them. In 2020, Valve acknowledged that this made it difficult to gather momentum and had slowed their output during the 2010s. Their VR projects and &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot; became a turning point, setting short-term studio-wide goals to focus the company. According to Walker, &quot;We sort of had to collectively admit we were wrong on the premise that you will be happiest if you work on something you personally want to work on the most.&quot;

In January 2023, &quot;People Make Games&quot; released a report on Valve&#x27;s corporate structure and culture, based on interviews with several current and former employees. They found that Valve&#x27;s flat structure and stack-ranking compensation system created a poor release record and a lack of employee diversity. In 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Newell owned 50.1% of Valve, with the rest owned by employees.

As part of Wolfire Games&#x27; lawsuit over Steam policies, case documents revealed details related to Valve&#x27;s employee structure. Starting with 60 employees in 2003, Valve grew to around 350 employees around 2012 and remained around this number through 2021. Up through 2010, the employees were categorized in three areas, administration, game development, and Steam development; in 2011, a hardware development category was added.

===Valve time===


Valve time is an industry term used jokingly with game releases from Valve, used to acknowledge the difference between the &quot;promised&quot; date for released content stated by Valve and to the &quot;actual&quot; release date; &quot;Valve Time&quot; includes delays but also includes some content that was released earlier than expected. Valve has acknowledged the term, including tracking known discrepancies between ideal and actual releases on their public development wiki and using it in announcements about such delays. Valve ascribes delays to their mentality of team-driven initiatives over corporate deadlines.

=== Playtesting ===
Valve playtests its games extensively from the beginning of development, and iterates based on the results. Its website states: &quot;We believe that all game designers are, in a sense, experimental psychologists.&quot; The Valve writer Chet Faliszek said he initially blamed testers when they failed to engage with designs as expected, but changed his mind when multiple testers had the same problem: &quot;By the third or fourth time, all of a sudden you&#x27;re realizing, &#x27;I&#x27;m an idiot. This is pretty obvious this doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s not their fault, it&#x27;s our fault.&#x27;&quot; He gave an example from the development of &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;, wherein a texture change caused every tester to miss a ladder and become stuck.

Walker said playtesting helped Valve maximize the experience for players. For example, when something exciting occurs by chance during a playtest, the developers attempt to have it occur for every player. Newell contrasted this approach to that of Warren Spector, whose open-ended games are designed to be replayed with different outcomes: &quot;You spend all of this time to build stuff that most players will never ever ever see ... If only one per cent of your customers see this cool thing that takes five per cent of your development budget, that&#x27;s not a good use of resources.&quot;

Valve also published the multiplayer game &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; and developed and published &quot;Left 4 Dead 2&quot;. Unreleased and canceled Valve games include the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Prospero&quot; and numerous &quot;Half-Life&quot; projects, including &quot;Episode Three&quot;. Valve worked with Arkane Studios on &quot;The Crossing&quot;, which was canceled in May 2009.

=== Steam ===

Valve announced Steam, its digital distribution service, at the 2002 Game Developers Conference. It was launched in September 2003 and was first used to deliver patches and other updates to Valve&#x27;s online games.

On August 1, 2012, Valve announced revisions to the Steam Subscriber Agreement (SSA) to prohibit class action lawsuits by users against the service provider. By July 2014, there were over 3,400 games available on Steam, with over 150 million registered accounts by January 2018.

Alongside these changes to the SSA, the company also declared publicly the incorporation of Valve S.a.r.l., a subsidiary based in Luxembourg. Valve set up a physical office in Kirchberg, Luxembourg. According to Valve&#x27;s project manager Mike Dunkle, the location was chosen for eCommerce capabilities and infrastructure, talent acquisition, tax advantages and central geographic location – most major partners are accessible, 50% within driving distance.

Valve S.a.r.l. was used to sell games to UK users to avoid paying the full 20% value-added tax (VAT). The tax loophole was expected to close on January 1, 2015. In December 2015, the French consumer group UFC Que Choisir initiated a lawsuit against Valve for several of their Steam policies that conflict or run afoul of French law. One of the reasons was for using the tax loophole. Valve S.a.r.l. ceased business on January 1, 2017, with the main company taking over EU sales again. In August 2017, Valve announced that Steam had reached over 67 million monthly and 33 million daily active users on the platform.

=== Steam Machine ===

Newell has been critical of the direction that Microsoft has taken with making Windows a closed architecture similar to Apple&#x27;s products, and has stated that he believes that the changes made in Windows 8 are &quot;a catastrophe for everyone in the [personal computer] space&quot;. Newell identified the open-source Linux platform as an ideal platform for Steam and said the only thing holding back its adoption is the lack of games.

In 2012, Valve announced that they were working on a console-PC hybrid for the living room, dubbed by media as the &quot;Steam Box&quot;. A precursor to such a unit is SteamOS, a freely available Linux-based operating system that builds upon the Steam client functionality that includes media services, live streaming across home networks, game sharing within families, and parental controls. SteamOS was officially announced in September 2013 as the first of several announcements related to the Steam Machine platform as well as their unique game controller. In May 2014, Valve announced that the company&#x27;s own SteamOS-powered Steam Machine would be delayed until 2015 due to problems with the game controller. In 2015, Alienware, ZOTAC, and CyberPowerPC launched their versions of the Steam Machine. By June 2016, fewer than half a million had been sold. While the Steam Machine line has been effectively canceled, Valve continued to manufacture and sell Steam Controllers until late November 2019, and publishes both mobile apps and software for the Steam Link, allowing in-home streaming.

===Valve Index and virtual reality===
At the Game Developers Conference in March 2015, Valve and Taiwanese electronics company HTC unveiled SteamVR and the HTC Vive—a virtual reality platform and a virtual reality headset. The platform would be distinguished by its &quot;Lighthouse&quot; motion tracking system, where sensors on the headset and its included motion controllers read the position of two base station devices mounted in the play area. This would allow for &quot;room-scale&quot; VR experiences, where the player would not be required to remain in a stationary position in front of a camera and would be able to freely walk around the space.

In November 2017, Microsoft added beta support for the SteamVR service for Windows Mixed Reality headsets. In June 2019, Valve released their own VR headset, known as the Valve Index, positioned as a higher-end device with wider field of view and higher refresh rate. They were accompanied by updated motion controllers, which are strapped against the user&#x27;s palms and have sensors for detecting input pressure and individual fingers.

===Steam Deck===
Announced in July 2021, the Steam Deck is a hybrid game console similar to the Nintendo Switch. It is primarily a handheld device that supports playing of Steam games, but through a separate dock unit, the console can output to an external monitor and use external power, networking, and USB accessories connected to the dock. The hardware is based on customized AMD Zen 2 and RDNA 2 chipsets. Units started shipping in February 2022.

=== Other projects ===
==== PowerPlay ====
PowerPlay was a technological initiative headed by Valve and Cisco Systems to decrease the latency for online games, announced in January 2000. It was described as a set of protocols and deployment standards at the router level to improve performance. It was claimed that a player with 1000 ms ping was able to play against another player on a LAN connection with no noticeable disadvantage. Initially the protocol was to be released with PowerPlay 1.0 focusing on quality of service (QoS) and later a revision, PowerPlay 2.0 that would focus on functionality. Cisco and Valve intended to deliver a single dial-up service in Q1 2000 in the United States with a 30-day free trial with a bundled copy of &quot;Team Fortress&quot; modified to support PowerPlay.

The standard was to involve purchasing PowerPlay approved Cisco hardware and infrastructure that had adequate bandwidth and QoS standards that prioritize PowerPlay gaming packets at all others&#x27; expense. Newell conceded that Internet service providers (ISPs) would bear the brunt of this expense: &quot;The ISPs are going to need to spend a fair amount of money to be compliant with PowerPlay. But how they get that back is up to them. Some will have a tiered service, and some will just try to recoup their investment through reduced customer churn and customer acquisition.&quot; Despite never deploying the dial-up plan featuring PowerPlay 1.0, Valve announced in January 2001 that the standard had indeed been finalized. 12 months after its announcement, PowerPlay was abandoned.

==== Pipeline ====
In July 2013, Valve announced Pipeline, an intern project consisting of ten high school students working together to learn how to create video game content. Pipeline serves to discuss and answer questions that teenagers often ask about the video game industry, and see if it is possible to train a group of teenagers with minimal work experience to work for a company like Valve. The latter purpose breaks Valve&#x27;s tradition of employing experienced developers, as the company is not good at &quot;teaching people straight out of school&quot;.

== Legal disputes ==
=== &quot;Valve Corporation v. Vivendi Universal Games&quot; ===
Between 2002 and 2005, Valve was involved in a complex legal dispute with its publisher, Vivendi Universal Games (under Vivendi&#x27;s brand Sierra Entertainment). Valve had entered into a publishing agreement with Sierra to release &quot;Half-Life&quot; and subsequent games in 1997, with the contract giving Sierra some intellectual property (IP) rights to Valve&#x27;s games. After Valve began development of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, it agreed a new contract with Sierra in 2001, removing these rights from Sierra and giving Valve some rights for digital distribution. Internally, Valve started work on Steam as a means to digitally distribute these games, and first revealed this project at the March 2002 Game Developers Conference.

By August 2002, Valve had found that Sierra was distributing copies of their games to Internet cafes against the terms of their contracts and filed a lawsuit against Sierra and Vivendi. In addition to claims of copyright infringement, Valve asserted that Sierra breached contract by withholding royalties and delaying the release of &quot;Counter-Strike: Condition Zero&quot; until after the holiday season. Vivendi and Sierra countersued, stating that Valve had misrepresented their position in the revised 2001 contract since they had been working on Steam at that point as a means to circumvent the publishing agreement. Vivendi sought intellectual property rights to &quot;Half-Life&quot; and a ruling preventing Valve from using Steam to distribute &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;.

On November 29, 2004, Judge Thomas Samuel Zilly of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled in favor of Valve. The ruling stated that Vivendi Universal and its affiliates (including Sierra) were not authorized to distribute Valve games, either directly or indirectly, through cyber cafés to end users for pay-to-play activities pursuant to the parties&#x27; publishing agreement. In addition, Judge Zilly ruled that Valve could recover copyright damages for infringements without regard to the publishing agreement&#x27;s limitation of liability clause. Valve posted on the Steam website that the companies had come to a settlement in court on April 29, 2005. Electronic Arts announced on July 18, 2005, that they would partner with Valve in a multi-year deal to distribute their games, replacing Vivendi Universal. As a result of the trial, the arbitrator also awarded Valve $2,391,932.

=== &quot;Valve Corporation v. Activision Blizzard&quot; ===
In April 2009, Valve sued Activision Blizzard, which acquired Sierra Entertainment after a merger with its parent company, Vivendi Universal Games. Activision had allegedly refused to honor the &quot;Valve v. Vivendi&quot; arbitration agreement. Activision had only paid Valve $1,967,796 of the $2,391,932 award, refusing to pay the remaining $424,136, claiming it had overpaid that sum in the past years.

=== &quot;Dota&quot; intellectual property ownership ===
&quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot; (DotA) was a landmark mod first released in 2003 that created the basis of the genre of multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA). It was originally developed by Kyle Sommer (who goes by the alias &quot;Eul&quot;) within Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot; via its world editor, and spawned several similar efforts, notably &quot;DotA-Allstars&quot;. While there had been several that contributed to &quot;DotA-Allstars&quot;, the project was managed primarily by Steve &quot;Guinsoo&quot; Feak, and later by &quot;IceFrog&quot;. IceFrog was eventually hired by Valve in 2009, with the rights to the &quot;DotA&quot; intellectual property being sold to Valve the following year. Eul was also hired into Valve by 2010. Valve then subsequently filed trademarks towards a sequel to &quot;DotA&quot;, titled &quot;Dota 2&quot;. DotA-Allstars, LLC, a group of former contributors to the &quot;DotA-Allstars&quot; project, filed an opposing trademark in August 2010 to contest Valve&#x27;s claim it owned the property rights.

DotA-Allstars, LLC was eventually acquired by Blizzard to start development of &quot;Blizzard All-Stars&quot;. Blizzard took over the trademark challenge. The United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office initially ruled in Valve&#x27;s favor. By this point, Riot Games had hired Guinsoo to help develop their own MOBA, &quot;League of Legends&quot;. As with IceFrog, Feak transferred his rights to the &quot;Dota&quot; property to Riot, who in turn sold those to Blizzard. Blizzard filed a lawsuit against Valve to challenge Valve&#x27;s ownership, pitting the rights assigned through IceFrog to Guinsoo at odds. The case &quot;Blizzard Entertainment v. Valve Corporation&quot; was settled out of court in May 2012; Valve retained the right to use &quot;Dota&quot; commercially, while Blizzard reserved the right for fans to use &quot;Dota&quot; non-commercially. Blizzard changed the names of its own projects to remove the &quot;Dota&quot; term, and renamed &quot;Blizzard All-Stars&quot; as &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;. Valve&#x27;s &quot;Dota 2&quot; was released in 2013.

In 2014, mobile developers Lilith and released their games &quot;Dota Legends&quot; and &quot;Heroes Charge&quot;, respectively. Both were influenced by &quot;Dota&quot; and the sequels. In 2017, Valve and Blizzard took joint action against these companies, citing copyright issues related to the &quot;Dota&quot; names. argued that the &quot;Dota&quot; games were a collective work and could not be copyrighted by anyone in particular, but the presiding judge, Charles R. Breyer, felt that, due to the trio&#x27;s actions as maintainers of the &quot;Dota&quot; mods, they had a rightful copyright claim to this. Separately, Lilith and argued that Eul had, in a forum post from September 2004, assigned an open-source copyright license to &quot;Dota&quot;, which would make Valve and Blizzard&#x27;s copyright claims void. The case was later heard by a jury.

=== &quot;ACCC v. Valve Corporation&quot; ===
The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) announced it was taking action against Valve in 2014. On March 29, 2016, Valve was found guilty of breaching Australian consumer law because:
* Valve claimed consumers were not entitled to a refund for digitally downloaded games purchased from Valve via the Steam website or Steam Client (in any circumstances);
* Valve had excluded statutory guarantees and/or warranties that goods would be of acceptable quality; and
* Valve had restricted or modified statutory guarantees and/or warranties of acceptable quality.

During the prosecution of this case, Valve implemented a refund policy for Steam purchases, but the case still reviewed Valve&#x27;s actions prior to the onset of the lawsuit. The court overseeing the case sided with the ACCC in assigning a (about ) fine against Valve in December 2016, as well as requiring Valve to inform Australian consumers of their rights when purchasing games from Steam. Valve appealed the court&#x27;s determination that it &quot;engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and made false or misleading representations about consumer guarantees&quot;, as well as seeking to appeal the fine, but the Australian higher courts rejected the appeals in December 2017. In January 2018, Valve filed for a &quot;special leave&quot; of the court&#x27;s decision, appealing to the High Court of Australia. The High Court dismissed this claim in April 2018, asserting that Valve still was liable under Australian law since it sold products directly to its citizens.

=== &quot;UFC Que Choisir v. Valve Corporation&quot; ===
Consumer rights group UFC Que Choisir, based in France, filed a lawsuit against Valve in December 2015, claiming users should be able to resell their software. The High Court of Paris ruled in favor of UFC Que Choisir in September 2019, stating that Valve must allow the resale of Steam games. Valve stated it will appeal the decision.

=== Skins gambling ===

Valve was named as a defendant in two lawsuits in June and July 2016 related to third-party gambling sites that use the Steamworks API to allow betting with the virtual currency of cosmetic weapon replacement textures, better known as &quot;skins&quot;, from &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, which through these sites can be converted from or to real-world money. Both suits assert Valve aiding in underaged gambling. Valve subsequently stated it has no commercial ties with these sites, and that it would demand these sites cease their use of the Steamworks API as they violate the authorized use policies. In October 2016, the Washington State Gambling Commission required Valve to stop the use of virtual skins for gambling on Steam, stating they would face legal repercussions if they failed to co-operate. On October 17, 2016, Valve sent a letter to the Washington State Gambling Commission stating that they had &quot;no business relationship with such gambling sites&quot;, asserting that they come into existence, operate, and go out of existence without their knowledge and consent, adding that they were not aware of any such law that Steam or any of their games were violating.

=== Anti-competitive practices ===
In February 2017, the European Commission began investigating Valve and five other publishers—Bandai Namco Entertainment, Capcom, Focus Home Interactive, Koch Media and ZeniMax Media—for anti-competitive practices, specifically the use of geo-blocking through the Steam storefront and Steam product keys to prevent access to software to citizens of certain countries. Such practices would be against the Digital Single Market initiative by the European Union. While the other five companies named are in stages of settling with the EU as of August 2019, Valve has stated it plans to fight the charges, asserting that geo-blocking affects less than 3% of its games, and that it had turned off such geo-blocking within the EU in 2015.

In January 2021, five gamers filed a proposed class-action antitrust lawsuit in California against Valve, alleging that the company &quot;abuses the Steam platform&#x27;s market power&quot; by requiring game developers and publishers to enter into a &#x27;most favored nation&#x27; agreement with Valve, restricting their ability to sell games for less on other platforms and thereby preventing price competition.

In May 2021, Wolfire Games filed a proposed class-action antitrust lawsuit against Valve, alleging that the company exerts monopoly power over the PC gaming market and uses its &quot;gatekeeper role&quot; to &quot;wield extreme power over publishers of PC Desktop Games&quot; and to extract &quot;an extraordinarily high cut from nearly every sale that passes through its store.&quot; Although a motion by Valve to dismiss the original lawsuit was granted in November 2021, Wolfire was allowed to file a revised complaint, and in May 2022 US District Court Judge John C. Coughenour ruled that that lawsuit could proceed, finding that Wolfire&#x27;s allegations were &quot;sufficient to plausibly allege unlawful conduct.&quot; Wolfire&#x27;s suit was consolidated with a similar lawsuit from another developer. In November 2024, it was affirmed into a class-action lawsuit, with any developer affected by Valve&#x27;s revenue cut able to be part of the class.

In June 2024, Vicki Shotbolt, a children&#x27;s digital rights activist, filed a lawsuit with the Competition Appeal Tribunal in the UK that accuses Valve of &quot;rigging the market&quot; for PC games, alleging that Valve used its market dominance to overcharge 14 million people in the UK and seeking damages of £22 to £44 per affected customer, or £656 million in total.

===&quot;Valve Corporation v. Zaiger, LLC&quot;===
In 2023, Valve sued a law firm, Zaiger, alleging that it attempted to extort settlements from Valve by threatening to bring numerous antitrust arbitration cases on behalf of Steam customers, a tactic referred to as &quot;mass arbitration&quot;. Valve also brought suit against a litigation financier for Zaiger over the funding of a social media campaign to recruit Steam users as clients. Valve alleged that they improperly interfered with its contracts with Steam customers and abused the arbitration process by signing up clients with the intent of obtaining settlements slightly lower than the cost of arbitration filing fees, rather than arbitrating their claims. Valve said that it was targeted due to the terms of the Steam Subscriber Agreement, in which Valve would be responsible for the fees and costs associated with arbitration. The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice by the US District Court for the Western District of Washington in 2024 due to personal jurisdiction issues.

In September 2024, Valve changed its Steam Subscriber Agreement to require disputes to proceed in court, with no option of arbitration.

<doc id="52843" wikidata="Q1514256" url="?curid=52843" title="Gesso">
<text>Gesso (; &#x27;chalk&#x27;, from the , from ), also known as &quot;glue gesso&quot; or &quot;Italian gesso&quot;, is a white paint mixture used to coat rigid surfaces such as wooden painting panels or masonite as a permanent absorbent primer substrate for painting. It consists of a binder mixed with chalk, gypsum, pigment, or any combination of these.

Gesso is used in painting as a preparation for any number of substrates such as wood panels, canvas and sculpture as a base for paint and other materials that are applied over it.

== Characteristics ==

The colour of gesso is usually white or off-white. Its absorbency makes it work with all painting media, including water-based media, different types of tempera and oil paint.

Mixing and applying it is a craft in itself, as it is usually applied in ten or more extremely thin layers. The hide glue mixture used to make the traditional gesso is rather brittle and susceptible to cracking, thus making it suitable for rigid surfaces only.

When painting, there are several advantages to using gesso. It provides a strong foundation for the paint to adhere to, prevents the paint from soaking into the surface, and can also be used to achieve a desired texture or surface finish. Furthermore, gesso can help to extend the life of a painting by acting as a barrier to protect it from moisture, dust, and UV rays.

== Composition ==
Gesso is traditionally a mix of an animal glue binder (usually rabbit-skin glue), chalk, and white pigment.

For priming flexible canvas, an emulsion of gesso and linseed oil, also called &quot;half-chalk ground&quot;, is used.

Acrylic gesso is a mixture of white pigment and some kind of filler (chalk, silica, etc.) and acrylic resin dispersed in water. It produces a soft, flexible non-absorbent surface that is technically not &quot;gesso&quot; (although it is commonly called that by its manufacturers). It can contain calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to increase the absorbency of the primer coat as well as titanium dioxide or &quot;titanium white&quot; as a whitening agent. It is sold premixed for both sizing and priming panels and flexible canvas for painting. Art supply manufacturers market canvases pre-primed with acrylic gesso. Acrylic gesso can be colored, either commercially by replacing the titanium white with another pigment, such as carbon black, or by the artist directly, with the addition of an acrylic paint. Acrylic gesso can be odorous, due to the presence of ammonia or formaldehyde, which are added in small amounts as preservatives. Acrylic gesso&#x27;s non-absorbent acrylic polymer base makes it incompatible with media that require an absorbent substrate, such as egg tempera. &quot;The Painter&#x27;s Handbook&quot; notes a problem with using oil paints over an acrylic gesso ground instead of a traditional oil ground, citing a mismatch in flexibility that over time could cause the oil paint to delaminate.

== Uses ==

Sculptors may use gesso to prepare the shape of a final sculpture (fused bronze) or directly as a material for sculpting. Gesso can also be used as a layer between sculpted wood and gold leaf. In this case, a layer of refined and coloured clay called bole is used to cover the gesso before applying the gold. Bole is usually red in colour.

Gesso can also serve as a base on three-dimensional surfaces for the application of paint or gold leaf.

<text>Children&#x27;s literature or juvenile literature includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are created for children. Modern children&#x27;s literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader, from picture books for the very young to young adult fiction.

Children&#x27;s literature can be traced to traditional stories like fairy tales, which have only been identified as children&#x27;s literature since the eighteenth century, and songs, part of a wider oral tradition, which adults shared with children before publishing existed. The development of early children&#x27;s literature, before printing was invented, is difficult to trace. Even after printing became widespread, many classic &quot;children&#x27;s&quot; tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience. Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children, often with a moral or religious message. Children&#x27;s literature has been shaped by religious sources, like Puritan traditions, or by more philosophical and scientific standpoints with the influences of Charles Darwin and John Locke. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are known as the &quot;Golden Age of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; because many classic children&#x27;s books were published then.

==Definition==
There is no single or widely used definition of children&#x27;s literature. It can be broadly defined as the body of written works and accompanying illustrations produced in order to entertain or instruct young people. The genre encompasses a wide range of works, including acknowledged classics of world literature, picture books and easy-to-read stories written exclusively for children, and fairy tales, lullabies, fables, folk songs, and other primarily orally transmitted materials or more specifically defined as fiction, non-fiction, poetry, or drama intended for and used by children and young people. One writer on children&#x27;s literature defines it as &quot;all books written for children, excluding works such as comic books, joke books, cartoon books, and non-fiction works that are not intended to be read from front to back, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference materials&quot;. However, others would argue that children&#x27;s comics should also be included: &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature studies has traditionally treated comics fitfully and superficially despite the importance of comics as a global phenomenon associated with children&quot;.

The &quot;International Companion Encyclopedia of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; notes that &quot;the boundaries of genre... are not fixed but blurred&quot;. Sometimes, no agreement can be reached about whether a given work is best categorized as literature for adults or children. Some works defy easy categorization. J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series was written and marketed for children, but it is also popular among adults. The series&#x27; extreme popularity led &quot;The New York Times&quot; to create a separate bestseller list for children&#x27;s books.

Despite the widespread association of children&#x27;s literature with picture books, spoken narratives existed before printing, and the root of many children&#x27;s tales go back to ancient storytellers. Seth Lerer, in the opening of &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature: A Reader&#x27;s History from Aesop to Harry Potter&quot;, says, &quot;This book presents a history of what children have heard and read... The history I write of is a history of &quot;reception&quot;.&quot;

== History ==

Early children&#x27;s literature consisted of spoken stories, songs, and poems, used to educate, instruct, and entertain children.
It was only in the eighteenth century, with the development of the concept of childhood, that a separate genre of children&#x27;s literature began to emerge, with its own divisions, expectations, and canon. The earliest of these books were educational books, books on conduct, and simple ABCs—often decorated with animals, plants, and anthropomorphic letters.

In 1962, French historian Philippe Ariès argues in his book &quot;Centuries of Childhood&quot; that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times. He explains that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment. As evidence for this position, he notes that, apart from instructional and didactic texts for children written by clerics like the Venerable Bede and Ælfric of Eynsham, there was a lack of any genuine literature aimed specifically at children before the 18th century.

Other scholars have qualified this viewpoint by noting that there was a literature designed to convey the values, attitudes, and information necessary for children within their cultures, such as the &quot;Play of Daniel&quot; from the twelfth century. Pre-modern children&#x27;s literature, therefore, tended to be of a didactic and moralistic nature, with the purpose of conveying conduct-related, educational and religious lessons.

===Early-modern Europe===

During the seventeenth century, the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe. Adults saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them. The English philosopher John Locke developed his theory of the tabula rasa in his 1690 &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;. In Locke&#x27;s philosophy, &quot;tabula rasa&quot; was the theory that the (human) mind is at birth a &quot;blank slate&quot; without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one&#x27;s sensory experiences. A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. Locke himself emphasized the importance of providing children with &quot;easy pleasant books&quot; to develop their minds rather than using force to compel them: &quot;Children may be cozen&#x27;d into a knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play themselves into that which others are whipp&#x27;d for.&quot; He also suggested that picture books be created for children.

In the nineteenth century, a few children&#x27;s titles became famous as classroom reading texts. Among these were the fables of Aesop and Jean de la Fontaine and Charles Perraults&#x27;s 1697 &quot;Tales of Mother Goose&quot;. The popularity of these texts led to the creation of a number of nineteenth-century fantasy and fairy tales for children which featured magic objects and talking animals.

Another influence on this shift in attitudes came from Puritanism, which stressed the importance of individual salvation. Puritans were concerned with the spiritual welfare of their children, and there was a large growth in the publication of &quot;good godly books&quot; aimed squarely at children. Some of the most popular works were by James Janeway, but the most enduring book from this movement, still read today, especially in modernised versions, is &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1678) by John Bunyan.

Chapbooks, pocket-sized pamphlets that were often folded instead of being stitched, were published in Britain; illustrated by woodblock printing, these inexpensive booklets reprinted popular ballads, historical re-tellings, and folk tales. Though not specifically published for children at this time, young people enjoyed the booklets as well. Johanna Bradley says, in &quot;From Chapbooks to Plum Cake&quot;, that chapbooks kept imaginative stories from being lost to readers under the strict Puritan influence of the time.

Hornbooks also appeared in England during this time, teaching children basic information such as the alphabet and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. These were brought from England to the American colonies in the mid-seventeenth century.

The first such book was a catechism for children, written in verse by the Puritan John Cotton. Known as &quot;Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes&quot;, it was published in 1646, appearing both in England and Boston. Another early book, &quot;The New England Primer&quot;, was in print by 1691 and used in schools for 100 years. The primer begins with &quot;The young Infant&#x27;s or Child&#x27;s morning Prayer&quot; and evening prayer. It then shows the alphabet, vowels, consonants, double letters, and syllables before providing a religious rhyme of the alphabet, beginning &quot;In Adam&#x27;s fall We sinned all...&quot;, and continues through the alphabet. It also contained religious maxims, acronyms, spelling help and other educational items, all decorated by woodcuts.

In 1634, the &quot;Pentamerone&quot; from Italy became the first major published collection of European folk tales. Charles Perrault began recording fairy tales in France, publishing his first collection in 1697. They were not well received among the French literary society, who saw them as only fit for old people and children. In 1658, John Amos Comenius in Bohemia published the informative illustrated &quot;Orbis Pictus&quot;, for children under six learning to read. It is considered to be the first picture book produced specifically for children.

The first Danish children&#x27;s book was &quot;The Child&#x27;s Mirror&quot; by Niels Bredal in 1568, an adaptation of a courtesy book by the Dutch priest Erasmus. &quot;A Pretty and Splendid Maiden&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, an adaptation of a German book for young women, became the first Swedish children&#x27;s book upon its 1591 publication. Sweden published fables and a children&#x27;s magazine by 1766.

In Italy, Giovanni Francesco Straparola released &quot;The Facetious Nights of Straparola&quot; in the 1550s. Called the first European storybook to contain fairy-tales, it eventually had 75 separate stories and written for an adult audience. Giulio Cesare Croce also borrowed from some stories children enjoyed for his books.

Russia&#x27;s earliest children&#x27;s books, primers, appeared in the late sixteenth century. An early example is &quot;ABC-Book&quot;, an alphabet book published by Ivan Fyodorov in 1571. The first picture book published in Russia, Karion Istomin&#x27;s &quot;The Illustrated Primer&quot;, appeared in 1694. Peter the Great&#x27;s interest in modernizing his country through Westernization helped Western children&#x27;s literature dominate the field through the eighteenth century. Catherine the Great wrote allegories for children, and during her reign, Nikolai Novikov started the first juvenile magazine in Russia.

===Origins of the modern genre===
The modern children&#x27;s book emerged in mid-18th-century England. A growing polite middle-class and the influence of Lockean theories of childhood innocence combined to create the beginnings of childhood as a concept. In an article for the British Library, professor MO Grenby writes, &quot;in the 1740s, a cluster of London publishers began to produce new books designed to instruct and delight young readers. Thomas Boreman was one. Another was Mary Cooper, whose two-volume &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Pretty Song Book&quot; (1744) is the first known nursery rhyme collection. But the most celebrated of these pioneers is John Newbery, whose first book for the entertainment of children was &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot;.&quot;
Widely considered the first modern children&#x27;s book, &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot; was the first children&#x27;s publication aimed at giving enjoyment to children, containing a mixture of rhymes, picture stories and games for pleasure. Newbery believed that play was a better enticement to children&#x27;s good behavior than physical discipline, and the child was to record his or her behaviour daily. The book was child–sized with a brightly colored cover that appealed to children—something new in the publishing industry. Known as gift books, these early books became the precursors to the toy books popular in the nineteenth century. Newbery was also adept at marketing this new genre. According to the journal &quot;The Lion and the Unicorn&quot;, &quot;Newbery&#x27;s genius was in developing the fairly new product category, children&#x27;s books, through his frequent advertisements... and his clever ploy of introducing additional titles and products into the body of his children&#x27;s books.&quot; Professor Grenby writes, &quot;Newbery has become known as the &#x27;father of children&#x27;s literature&#x27; chiefly because he was able to show that publishing children&#x27;s books could be a commercial success.&quot;
The improvement in the quality of books for children and the diversity of topics he published helped make Newbery the leading producer of children&#x27;s books in his time. He published his own books as well as those by authors such as Samuel Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith; the latter may have written &quot;The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes&quot;, Newbery&#x27;s most popular book.

Another philosopher who influenced the development of children&#x27;s literature was Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who argued that children should be allowed to develop naturally and joyously. His idea of appealing to a children&#x27;s natural interests took hold among writers for children. Popular examples included Thomas Day&#x27;s &quot;The History of Sandford and Merton&quot;, four volumes that embody Rousseau&#x27;s theories. Furthermore, Maria and Richard Lovell Edgeworth&#x27;s &quot;Practical Education: The History of Harry and Lucy&quot; (1780) urged children to teach themselves.

Rousseau&#x27;s ideas also had great influence in Germany, especially on German Philanthropism, a movement concerned with reforming both education and literature for children. Its founder, Johann Bernhard Basedow, authored &quot;Elementarwerk&quot; as a popular textbook for children that included many illustrations by Daniel Chodowiecki. Another follower, Joachim Heinrich Campe, created an adaptation of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; that went into over 100 printings. He became Germany&#x27;s &quot;outstanding and most modern&quot; writer for children. According to Hans-Heino Ewers in &quot;The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, &quot;It can be argued that from this time, the history of European children&#x27;s literature was largely written in Germany.&quot;
The Brothers Grimm preserved and published the traditional tales told in Germany. They were so popular in their home country that modern, realistic children&#x27;s literature began to be looked down on there. This dislike of non-traditional stories continued there until the beginning of the next century. In addition to their collection of stories, the Grimm brothers also contributed to children&#x27;s literature through their academic pursuits. As professors, they had a scholarly interest in the stories, striving to preserve them and their variations accurately, recording their sources.

A similar project was carried out by the Norwegian scholars Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, who collected Norwegian fairy tales and published them as &quot;Norwegian Folktales&quot;, often referred to as &quot;Asbjørnsen and Moe&quot;. By compiling these stories, they preserved Norway&#x27;s literary heritage and helped create the Norwegian written language.

Danish author and poet Hans Christian Andersen traveled through Europe and gathered many well-known fairy tales and created new stories in the fairy tale genre.

In Switzerland, Johann David Wyss published &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; in 1812, with the aim of teaching children about family values, good husbandry, the uses of the natural world and self-reliance. The book became popular across Europe after it was translated into French by Isabelle de Montolieu.

E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s tale &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot; was published in 1816 in a German collection of stories for children, &quot;Kinder-Märchen&quot;. It is the first modern short story to introduce bizarre, odd and grotesque elements in children&#x27;s literature and thereby anticipates Lewis Carroll&#x27;s tale, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. There are not only parallels concerning the content (the weird adventures of a young girl in a fantasy land), but also the origin of the tales as both are dedicated and given to a daughter of the author&#x27;s friends.

===Golden age===
The shift to a modern genre of children&#x27;s literature occurred in the mid-19th century; didacticism of a previous age began to make way for more humorous, child-oriented books, more attuned to the child&#x27;s imagination. The availability of children&#x27;s literature greatly increased as well, as paper and printing became widely available and affordable, the population grew and literacy rates improved.

&quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; by Thomas Hughes appeared in 1857, and is considered to be the founding book in the school story tradition. However, it was Lewis Carroll&#x27;s fantasy, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, published in 1865 in England, that signaled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one. Regarded as the first &quot;English masterpiece written for children&quot; and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature, its publication opened the &quot;First Golden Age&quot; of children&#x27;s literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early 1900s. The fairy-tale absurdity of Wonderland has solid historical ground as a satire of the serious problems of the Victorian era. Lewis Carroll is ironic about the prim and all-out regulated life of the &quot;golden&quot; Victorian century. One other noteworthy publication was Mark Twain&#x27;s book &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; (1876), which was one of the first &quot;boy books&quot;, intended for children but enjoyed by both children and adults alike. These were classified as such for the themes they contained, consisting of fighting and work. Another important book of that decade was &quot;The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby&quot;, by Rev. Charles Kingsley (1862), which became extremely popular and remains a classic of British children&#x27;s literature.

In 1883, Carlo Collodi wrote the first Italian fantasy novel, &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;, which was translated many times. In that same year, Emilio Salgari, the man who would become &quot;the adventure writer par excellence for the young in Italy&quot; first published his legendary character &quot;Sandokan&quot;. In Britain, &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Princess and Curdie&quot;, by George MacDonald, appeared in 1872 and 1883, and the adventure stories &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, both by Robert Louis Stevenson, were extremely popular in the 1880s. Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was first published in 1894, and J. M. Barrie told the story of Peter Pan in the novel &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; in 1911. Johanna Spyri&#x27;s two-part novel &quot;Heidi&quot; was published in Switzerland in 1880 and 1881.

In the US, children&#x27;s publishing entered a period of growth after the American Civil War in 1865. Boys&#x27; book writer Oliver Optic published over 100 books. In 1868, the &quot;epoch-making&quot; &quot;Little Women&quot;, the fictionalized autobiography of Louisa May Alcott, was published. This &quot;coming of age&quot; story established the genre of realistic family books in the United States. Mark Twain released &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; in 1876. In 1880 another bestseller, &quot;Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings&quot;, a collection of African American folk tales adapted and compiled by Joel Chandler Harris, appeared.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a plethora of children&#x27;s novels began featuring realistic, non-magical plotlines. Certain titles received international success such as Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883), L. M. Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1908), and Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot; (1869).

==National traditions==
===United Kingdom===
Literature for children had developed as a separate category of literature especially in the Victorian era, with some works becoming internationally known, such as Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) and its sequel &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. Another classic of the period is Anna Sewell&#x27;s animal novel &quot;Black Beauty&quot; (1877). At the end of the Victorian era and leading into the Edwardian era, author and illustrator Beatrix Potter published &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; in 1902. Potter went on to produce 23 children&#x27;s books and become very wealthy. A pioneer of character merchandising, in 1903 she patented a Peter Rabbit doll, making Peter the first licensed character. Michael O. Tunnell and James S. Jacobs, professors of children&#x27;s literature at Brigham Young University, write, &quot;Potter was the first to use pictures as well as words to tell the story, incorporating coloured illustration with text, page for page.&quot;

Rudyard Kipling published &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; in 1894. A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of Mowgli, echoing Kipling&#x27;s own childhood. In the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by English illustrators Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, and Kate Greenaway. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Some British artists made their living illustrating novels and children&#x27;s books, among them Arthur Rackham, Cicely Mary Barker, W. Heath Robinson, Henry J. Ford, John Leech, and George Cruikshank. In the 1890s, some of the best known fairy tales from England were compiled in Joseph Jacobs&#x27; &quot;English Fairy Tales&quot;, including &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;, &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;, &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; and &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;.

The Kailyard School of Scottish writers, notably J. M. Barrie, creator of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, Kenneth Grahame wrote the children&#x27;s classic &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; and the Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powell&#x27;s first book, &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, was published. Inspiration for Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1910) was the Great Maytham Hall Garden in Kent. While fighting in the trenches for the British Army in World War I, Hugh Lofting created the character of Doctor Dolittle, who appears in a series of twelve books.

The Golden Age of Children&#x27;s Literature ended with World War I. The period before World War II was much slower in children&#x27;s publishing. The main exceptions in England were the publications of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; by A. A. Milne in 1926, the first &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; book by P. L. Travers in 1934, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien in 1937, and the Arthurian &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; by T. H. White in 1938. Children&#x27;s mass paperback books were first released in England in 1940 under the Puffin Books imprint, and their lower prices helped make book buying possible for children during World War II. Enid Blyton&#x27;s books have been among the world&#x27;s bestsellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Blyton&#x27;s books are still enormously popular and have been translated into almost 90 languages. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her Noddy, &quot;The Famous Five&quot;, The Secret Seven, and &quot;The Adventure Series&quot;. The first of these children&#x27;s stories, &quot;Five on a Treasure Island&quot;, was published in 1942.
In the 1950s, the book market in Europe began to recover from the effects of the two world wars. An informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the &quot;Inklings&quot;, with the major fantasy novelists C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien as its main members. C. S. Lewis published the first installment of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series in 1950, while Tolkien is best known, in addition to &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, as the author of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954). Another writer of fantasy stories is Alan Garner author of &quot;Elidor&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Owl Service&quot; (1967). The latter is an adaptation of the myth of Blodeuwedd from the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, set in modern Wales – it won Garner the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British author.

Mary Norton wrote &quot;The Borrowers&quot; (1952), featuring tiny people who borrow from humans. Dodie Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; was published in 1956. Philippa Pearce&#x27;s &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot; (1958) has Tom opening the garden door at night and entering into a different age. William Golding&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; focuses on a group of British boys stranded on an uninhabited island and their disastrous attempt to govern themselves.
Roald Dahl wrote children&#x27;s fantasy novels which were often inspired from experiences from his childhood, with often unexpected endings, and unsentimental, dark humour. Dahl was inspired to write &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1964), featuring the eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka, having grown up near two chocolate makers in England who often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies into the other&#x27;s factory. His other works include &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; (1961), &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; (1970), &quot;The BFG&quot; (1982), &quot;The Witches&quot; (1983), and &quot;Matilda&quot; (1988). Starting in 1958, Michael Bond published more than twenty humorous stories about Paddington Bear.

Boarding schools in literature are centred on older pre-adolescent and adolescent school life, and are most commonly set in English boarding schools. Popular school stories from this period include Ronald Searle&#x27;s comic &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1949–1953) and his illustrations for Geoffrey Willans&#x27;s &quot;Molesworth&quot; series, Jill Murphy&#x27;s &quot;The Worst Witch&quot;, and the &quot;Jennings&quot; series by Anthony Buckeridge.

Ruth Manning-Sanders&#x27;s first collection, &quot;A Book of Giants&quot;, retells a number of giant stories from around the world. Susan Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; is a five-volume fantasy saga set in England and Wales. Raymond Briggs&#x27; children&#x27;s picture book &quot;The Snowman&quot; (1978) has been adapted as an animation, shown every Christmas on British television. The Reverend. W. Awdry and son Christopher&#x27;s &quot;The Railway Series&quot; features Thomas the Tank Engine. Margery Sharp&#x27;s series &quot;The Rescuers&quot; is based on a heroic mouse organisation. The third Children&#x27;s Laureate Michael Morpurgo published &quot;War Horse&quot; in 1982. Dick King-Smith&#x27;s novels include &quot;The Sheep-Pig&quot; (1984). Diana Wynne Jones wrote the young adult fantasy novel &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; in 1986. Anne Fine&#x27;s &quot;Madame Doubtfire&quot; (1987) is based around a family with divorced parents. Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Alex Rider&quot; series begins with &quot;Stormbreaker&quot; (2000).
Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; is an epic trilogy of fantasy novels consisting of &quot;Northern Lights&quot; (1995, published as &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; in North America), &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; (2000). It follows the coming of age of two children, Lyra Belacqua and Will Parry, as they wander through a series of parallel universes. The three novels have won a number of awards, most notably the 2001 Whitbread Book of the Year prize, won by &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;. &quot;Northern Lights&quot; won the Carnegie Medal for children&#x27;s fiction in 1995.

Neil Gaiman wrote the dark fantasy novella &quot;Coraline&quot; (2002). His 2008 fantasy, &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot;, traces the story of a boy who is raised by the supernatural occupants of a graveyard. In 2001, Terry Pratchett received the Carnegie Medal (his first major award) for &quot;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&quot;. Cressida Cowell&#x27;s &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; series were published between 2003 and 2015.

J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fantasy sequence of seven novels chronicles the adventures of the adolescent wizard Harry Potter. The series began with &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; in 1997 and ended with the seventh and final book &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; in 2007; becoming the best selling book-series in history. The series has been translated into 67 languages, so placing Rowling among the most translated authors in history.

====Adventure fiction====
While Daniel Defoe wrote &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; in 1719 (spawning so many imitations it defined a genre, Robinsonade), adventure stories written specifically for children began in the nineteenth century. Early examples from British authors include Frederick Marryat&#x27;s &quot;The Children of the New Forest&quot; (1847) and Harriet Martineau&#x27;s &quot;The Peasant and the Prince&quot; (1856).

The Victorian era saw the development of the genre, with W. H. G. Kingston, R. M. Ballantyne and G. A. Henty specializing in the production of adventure fiction for boys. This inspired writers who normally catered to adult audiences to write for children, a notable example being Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s classic pirate story &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883).

In the years after the First World War, writers such as Arthur Ransome developed the adventure genre by setting the adventure in Britain rather than distant countries. In the 1930s he began publishing his Swallows and Amazons series of children&#x27;s books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the English Lake District and the Norfolk Broads. Many of them involve sailing; fishing and camping are other common subjects. Biggles was a popular series of adventure books for young boys, about James Bigglesworth, a fictional pilot and adventurer, by W. E. Johns. Between 1941 and 1961 there were 60 issues with stories about Biggles, and in the 1960s occasional contributors included the BBC astronomer Patrick Moore. Between 1940 and 1947, W. E. Johns contributed sixty stories featuring the female pilot Worrals. Evoking epic themes, Richard Adams&#x27;s 1972 survival and adventure novel &quot;Watership Down&quot; follows a small group of rabbits who escape the destruction of their warren and seek to establish a new home.

Geoffrey Trease and Rosemary Sutcliff brought a new sophistication to the historical adventure novel. Philip Pullman in the Sally Lockhart novels and Julia Golding in the Cat Royal series have continued the tradition of the historical adventure.

====Magazines and comics====
An important aspect of British children&#x27;s literature has been comic books and magazines. Amongst the most popular and longest running comics have been &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot;, both first published in the 1930s. British comics in the 20th century evolved from illustrated penny dreadfuls of the Victorian era (featuring Sweeney Todd, Dick Turpin and &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot;). First published in the 1830s, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, penny dreadfuls were &quot;Britain&#x27;s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.&quot; Robin Hood featured in a series of penny dreadfuls in 1838 which sparked the beginning of the mass circulation of Robin stories.

Dennis the Menace debuted in &quot;The Beano&quot; in 1951, while the popular stop-motion characters, Wallace and Gromit, guest-starred in the comic every four weeks from 2013. Important early magazines or story papers for older children were the &quot;Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot;, published from 1879 to 1967 and &quot;The Girl&#x27;s Own Paper&quot; published from 1880 until 1956. In the 1890s, half-penny publications succeeded the penny dreadfuls in popularity among British children. These included &quot;The Half-penny Marvel&quot; and &quot;Union Jack&quot;. From 1896, the cover of the half-penny comic &quot;Illustrated Chips&quot; featured the long-running comic strip of the tramps Weary Willie and Tired Tim, with its readers including a young Charlie Chaplin.

Other story papers for older boys were &quot;The Hotspur&quot; (1933 to 1959) and &quot;The Rover&quot;, which started in 1922 and was absorbed into &quot;Adventure&quot; in 1961 and &quot;The Wizard&quot; in 1963, and eventually folded in 1973. Many prominent authors contributed to the &quot;Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot;: cricketer W.G. Grace wrote for several issues, along with authors Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and R. M. Ballantyne, as well as Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scout Movement. Contributors to &quot;The Girl&#x27;s Own Paper&quot; included Noel Streatfeild, Rosa Nouchette Carey, Sarah Doudney (1841–1926), Angela Brazil, Richmal Crompton, Fanny Fern, and Baroness Orczy.

The &quot;Eagle&quot; was a popular British comic for boys, launched in 1950 by Marcus Morris, an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, &quot;Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future&quot;, created with meticulous attention to detail. It was first published from 1950 to 1969, and relaunched from 1982 to 1994. Its sister comic was &quot;Girl&quot;, whose early issues from 1951 featured the strip &quot;Kitty Hawke and her All-Girl Air Crew&quot;. &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, an immensely popular comic strip featuring Roy Race, a striker for the fictional football team Melchester Rovers, first appeared in the &quot;Tiger&quot; in 1954. First published by Martin Handford in 1987, more than 73 million &quot;Where&#x27;s Wally?&quot; picture puzzle books had been sold around the world by 2007.

===United States===

Children&#x27;s literature has been a part of American culture since Europeans first settled in America. The earliest books were used as tools to instill self-control in children and preach a life of morality in Puritan society. Eighteenth-century American youth began to shift away from the social upbringing of its European counterpart, bringing about a change in children&#x27;s literature. It was in this time that &quot;A Little Book for Little Children&quot; was written by T. W. in 1712. It includes what is thought to be the earliest nursery rhyme and one of the earliest examples of a textbook approaching education from the child&#x27;s point of view, rather than the adult&#x27;s.

Children&#x27;s magazines in the United States began with the &quot;Young&quot; &quot;Misses&#x27; Magazine&quot; (1806) of Brooklyn, New York.

One of the most famous books of American children&#x27;s literature is L. Frank Baum&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, published in 1900. &quot;By combining the English fondness for word play with the American appetite for outdoor adventure&quot;, Connie Epstein in &quot;International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; says Baum &quot;developed an original style and form that stands alone&quot;. Baum wrote fourteen more Oz novels, and other writers continued the Oz series into the twenty-first century.

Demand continued to grow in North America between World War I and World War II, helped by the growth of libraries in both Canada and the United States. Children&#x27;s reading rooms in libraries, staffed by specially trained librarians, helped create demand for classic juvenile books. Reviews of children&#x27;s releases began appearing regularly in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and in &quot;The Bookman&quot; magazine began to publish regular reviews of children&#x27;s releases. The first Children&#x27;s Book Week was launched in 1919. In that same year, Louise Seaman Bechtel became the first person to head a juvenile book publishing department in the country. She was followed by May Massee in 1922, and Alice Dalgliesh in 1934. During this period, Black authors began writing and publishing books for African American children. Writers like Helen Adele Whiting (1885–1959) and Jane Dabney Shackelford (1895–1979) produced books designed to instill pride in Black history and culture.

The American Library Association began awarding the Newbery Medal, the first children&#x27;s book award, in 1922. The Caldecott Medal for illustration followed in 1938. The first book by Laura Ingalls Wilder about her life on the American frontier, &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; appeared in 1932. In 1937 Dr. Seuss published his first book, entitled, &quot;And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street&quot;. The young adult book market developed during this period, thanks to sports books by popular writer John R. Tunis&#x27;, the novel &quot;Seventeenth Summer&quot; by Maureen Daly, and the &quot;Sue Barton&quot; nurse book series by Helen Dore Boylston.

The already vigorous growth in children&#x27;s books became a boom in the 1950s, and children&#x27;s publishing became big business. In 1952, American journalist E. B. White published &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, which was described as &quot;one of the very few books for young children that face, squarely, the subject of death&quot;. Maurice Sendak illustrated more than two dozen books during the decade, which established him as an innovator in book illustration. The Sputnik crisis that began in 1957, provided increased interest and government money for schools and libraries to buy science and math books and the non-fiction book market &quot;seemed to materialize overnight&quot;.

The 1960s saw an age of new realism in children&#x27;s books emerge. Given the atmosphere of social revolution in 1960s America, authors and illustrators began to break previously established taboos in children&#x27;s literature. Controversial subjects dealing with alcoholism, death, divorce, and child abuse were now being published in stories for children. Maurice Sendak&#x27;s &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; in 1963 and Louise Fitzhugh&#x27;s &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot; in 1964 are often considered the first stories published in this new age of realism.

Esther Forbes in &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; (1943) and Mildred D. Taylor in &quot;Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry&quot; (1976) continued the tradition of the historical adventure in an American setting. The modern children&#x27;s adventure novel sometimes deals with controversial issues like terrorism, as in Robert Cormier&#x27;s &quot;After the First Death&quot; in 1979, and warfare in the Third World, as in Peter Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;AK&quot; in 1990.

In books for a younger age group, Bill Martin and John Archambault&#x27;s &quot;Chicka Chicka Boom Boom&quot; (1989) presented a new spin on the alphabet book. Laura Numeroff published &quot;If You Give a Mouse a Cookie&quot; in 1985 and went on to create a series of similarly named books that is still popular for children and adults to read together.

Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; (1964–1968) was set in a fictionalized version of medieval Britain.

===Continental Europe===
Johann David Wyss wrote the adventure novel &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1812). The period from 1890 until World War I is considered the Golden Age of Children&#x27;s Literature in Scandinavia. Erik Werenskiold, Theodor Kittelsen, and Dikken Zwilgmeyer were especially popular, writing folk and fairy tales as well as realistic fiction. The 1859 translation into English by George Webbe Dasent helped increase the stories&#x27; influence. One of the most influential and internationally most successful Scandinavian children&#x27;s books from this period is Selma Lagerlöfs &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Nils&quot;. Astrid Lindgren (&quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;) and Jostein Gaarder (&quot;Sophie&#x27;s World&quot;) are two of the best-known Scandinavian writers internationally. In Finland, some of the most significant children&#x27;s book writers include Tove Jansson (&quot;Moomins&quot;), Oiva Paloheimo (&quot;Tirlittan&quot;) and Elina Karjalainen (&quot;Uppo-Nalle&quot;).

The interwar period saw a slow-down in output similar to Britain&#x27;s, although &quot;one of the first mysteries written specifically for children&quot;, &quot;Emil and the Detectives&quot; by Erich Kästner, was published in Germany in 1930. German writers Michael Ende (&quot;The Neverending Story&quot;) and Cornelia Funke (&quot;Inkheart&quot;) achieved international success with their fantasy books.

The period during and following World War II became the Classic Age of the picture book in Switzerland, with works by Alois Carigiet, Felix Hoffmann, and Hans Fischer. Nineteen sixty-three was the first year of the Bologna Children&#x27;s Book Fair in Italy, which was described as &quot;the most important international event dedicated to the children&#x27;s publishing&quot;. For four days it brings together writers, illustrators, publishers, and book buyers from around the world.

===Russia and the Soviet Union===

Russian folktales were collected by Aleksandr Afanasyev in his three-volume &quot;Narodnye russkie skazki&quot;, and a selection of these were published in &quot;Русские детские сказки&quot; (Russian Children&#x27;s Fairy Tales) in 1871. By the 1860s, literary realism and non-fiction dominated children&#x27;s literature. More schools were started, using books by writers like Konstantin Ushinsky and Leo Tolstoy, whose &quot;Russian Reader&quot; included an assortment of stories, fairy tales, and fables. Books written specifically for girls developed in the 1870s and 1880s. Publisher and journalist Evgenia Tur wrote about the daughters of well-to-do landowners, while Alexandra Nikitichna Annenskaya&#x27;s stories told of middle-class girls working to support themselves. Vera Zhelikhovsky, Elizaveta Kondrashova, and Nadezhda Lukhmanova also wrote for girls during this period.

Children&#x27;s non-fiction gained great importance in Russia at the beginning of the century. A ten-volume children&#x27;s encyclopedia was published between 1913 and 1914. Vasily Avenarius wrote fictionalized biographies of important people like Nikolai Gogol and Alexander Pushkin around the same time, and scientists wrote for books and magazines for children. Children&#x27;s magazines flourished, and by the end of the century there were 61. Lidia Charskaya and continued the popularity of girls&#x27; fiction. Realism took a gloomy turn by frequently showing the maltreatment of children from lower classes. The most popular boys&#x27; material was Sherlock Holmes, and similar stories from detective magazines.

The state took control of children&#x27;s literature during the October Revolution. Maksim Gorky edited the first children&#x27;s &quot;Northern Lights&quot; under Soviet rule. People often label the 1920s as the Golden Age of Children&#x27;s Literature in Russia. Samuil Marshak led that literary decade as the &quot;founder of (Soviet) children&#x27;s literature&quot;. As head of the children&#x27;s section of the State Publishing House and editor of several children&#x27;s magazines, Marshak exercised enormous influence by recruiting Boris Pasternak and Osip Mandelstam to write for children.

In 1932, professional writers in the Soviet Union formed the USSR Union of Writers, which served as the writer&#x27;s organization of the Communist Party. With a children&#x27;s branch, the official oversight of the professional organization brought children&#x27;s writers under the control of the state and the police. Communist principles like collectivism and solidarity became important themes in children&#x27;s literature. Authors wrote biographies about revolutionaries like Lenin and Pavlik Morozov. Alexander Belyayev, who wrote in the 1920s and 1930s, became Russia&#x27;s first science fiction writer. According to Ben Hellman in the &quot;International Companion Encyclopedia of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, &quot;war was to occupy a prominent place in juvenile reading, partly compensating for the lack of adventure stories&quot;, during the Soviet Period. More political changes in Russia after World War II brought further change in children&#x27;s literature. Today, the field is in a state of flux because some older authors are being rediscovered and others are being abandoned.

===China===
The 1911 Revolution and World War II brought political and social change that revolutionized children&#x27;s literature in China. Western science, technology, and literature became fashionable. China&#x27;s first modern publishing firm, Commercial Press, established several children&#x27;s magazines, which included &quot;Youth Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Educational Pictures for Children&quot;. The first Chinese children&#x27;s writer was Sun Yuxiu, an editor of Commercial Press, whose story &quot;The Kingdom Without a Cat&quot; was written in the language of the time instead of the classical style used previously. Yuxiu encouraged novelist Shen Dehong to write for children as well. Dehong went on to rewrite 28 stories based on classical Chinese literature specifically for children. In 1932, Zhang Tianyi published &quot;Big Lin and Little Lin&quot;, the first full-length Chinese novel for children.

The Chinese Communist Revolution changed children&#x27;s literature again. Many children&#x27;s writers were denounced, but Tianyi and Ye Shengtao continued to write for children and created works that were aligned with Maoist ideology. The 1976 death of Mao Zedong provoked more changes that swept China. The work of many writers from the early part of the century became available again. In 1990 came &quot;General Anthology of Modern Children&#x27;s Literature of China&quot;, a fifteen-volume anthology of children&#x27;s literature since the 1920s.

===Brazil===

In Brazil, Monteiro Lobato wrote a series of 23 books for children known as Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (The Yellow Woodpecker Ranch), between 1920 and 1940. The series is considered representative of Brazilian children&#x27;s literature and the Brazilian equivalent to children&#x27;s classics such as C. S. Lewis, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; and L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; series. The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato&#x27;s 1920 short story &quot;A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado&quot;, and was later republished as the first chapter of &quot;Reinações de Narizinho&quot;, which is the first novel of the series. The main setting is the &quot;Sítio do Picapau Amarelo&quot;, where a boy (Pedrinho), a girl (Narizinho) and their living and thinking anthropomorphic toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning. On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as Neverland, the mythological Ancient Greece, an underwater world known as &quot;Reino das Águas Claras&quot; (Clear Waters Kingdom), and even the outer space. The &quot;Sítio&quot; is often symbolized by the character of Emília, Lobato&#x27;s most famous creation.

===India===

Christian missionaries first established the Calcutta School-Book Society in the 19th century, creating a separate genre for children&#x27;s literature in the country. Magazines and books for children in native languages soon appeared. In the latter half of the century, Raja Shivprasad wrote several well-known books in Hindustani. A number of respected Bengali writers began producing Bengali literature for children, including Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, who translated some stories and wrote others himself. Nobel Prize-winner Rabindranath Tagore wrote plays, stories, and poems for children, including one work illustrated by painter Nandalal Bose. They worked from the end of the nineteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth. Tagore&#x27;s work was later translated into English, with Bose&#x27;s pictures. Behari Lal Puri was the earliest writer for children in Punjabi. His stories were didactic in nature.

The first full-length children&#x27;s book was &quot;Khar Khar Mahadev&quot; by Narain Dixit, which was serialized in one of the popular children&#x27;s magazines in 1957. Other writers include Premchand, and poet Sohan Lal Dwivedi. In 1919, Sukumar Ray wrote and illustrated nonsense rhymes in the Bengali language, and children&#x27;s writer and artist Abanindranath Tagore finished &quot;Barngtarbratn&quot;. Bengali children&#x27;s literature flourished in the later part of the twentieth century. Educator Gijubhai Badheka published over 200 books in the Children&#x27;s literature in Gujarati language, and many are still popular. Other popular Gujarati children&#x27;s authors were Ramanlal Soni and Jivram Joshi. In 1957, political cartoonist K. Shankar Pillai founded the Children&#x27;s Book Trust publishing company. The firm became known for high quality children&#x27;s books, and many of them were released in several languages. One of the most distinguished writers is Pandit Krushna Chandra Kar in Oriya literature, who wrote many good books for children, including &quot;Pari Raija&quot;, &quot;Kuhuka Raija&quot;, &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, and &quot;Adi Jugara Galpa Mala&quot;. He wrote biographies of many historical personalities, such as &quot;Kapila Deva&quot;. In 1978, the firm organized a writers&#x27; competition to encourage quality children&#x27;s writing. The following year, the Children&#x27;s Book Trust began a writing workshop and organized the First International Children&#x27;s Book Fair in New Delhi. Children&#x27;s magazines, available in many languages, were widespread throughout India during this century. Ruskin Bond is also a famous Anglo-Indian writer for children.

===Iran===
One of the pioneering children&#x27;s writer in Persian was Mehdi Azar-Yazdi. His award-winning work, &quot;Good Stories for Good Children&quot;, is a collection of stories derived from the stories in Classical Persian literature re-written for children.

===Nigeria===

Originally, for centuries, stories were told by Africans in their native languages, many being told during social gatherings. Stories varied between mythic narratives dealing with creation and basic proverbs showcasing human wisdom. These narratives were passed down from generation to generation orally. Since its independence in 1960, Nigeria has witnessed a rise in the production of children&#x27;s literature by its people, the past three decades contributing the most to the genre. Most children&#x27;s books depict the African culture and lifestyle, and trace their roots to traditional folktales, riddles, and proverbs. Authors who have produced such works include Chinua Achebe, Cyprian Ekwensi, Amos Tutuola, Flora Nwapa, and Buchi Emecheta. Publishing companies also aided in the development of children&#x27;s literature.

==Classification==
Children&#x27;s literature can be divided into categories, either according to genre or the intended age of the reader.

Much of children&#x27;s literature is series fiction (book series).
===By genre===
A literary genre is a category of literary compositions. Genres may be determined by technique, tone, content, or length. According to Anderson, there are six categories of children&#x27;s literature (with some significant subgenres):
*Picture books, including concept books that teach the alphabet or counting for example, pattern books, and wordless books
*Traditional literature, including folktales, which convey the legends, customs, superstitions, and beliefs of people in previous civilizations. This genre can be further broken into sub genres: myths, fables, legends, and fairy tales
*Fiction, including fantasy, realistic fiction, mystery, science fiction and historical fiction
*Non-fiction which can include narrative non-fiction which is a true story written in the style of a novel
*Biography and autobiography
*Poetry and verse which can include novels written entirely in verse.

===By age category===
The criteria for these divisions are vague, and books near a borderline may be classified either way. Books for younger children tend to be written in simple language, use large print, and have many illustrations. Books for older children use increasingly complex language, normal print, and fewer (if any) illustrations. The categories with an age range are these:
*Picture books, appropriate for pre-readers or children ages 0–8
*Early reader books, appropriate for children ages 5–7. These are often designed to help children build their reading skills and help them make the transition to becoming independent readers
*Chapter books, appropriate for children ages 7–10
*Middle grade fiction, appropriate for children ages 8–12
*Young adult fiction, appropriate for children ages 12–18

==Illustration==

Pictures have always accompanied children&#x27;s stories. A papyrus from Byzantine Egypt, shows illustrations accompanied by the story of Hercules&#x27; labors. Modern children&#x27;s books are illustrated in a way that is rarely seen in adult literature, except in graphic novels. Generally, artwork plays a greater role in books intended for younger readers (especially pre-literate children). Children&#x27;s picture books often serve as an accessible source of high quality art for young children. Even after children learn to read well enough to enjoy a story without illustrations, they (like their elders) continue to appreciate the occasional drawings found in chapter books.

According to Joyce Whalley in &quot;The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, &quot;an illustrated book differs from a book with illustrations in that a good illustrated book is one where the pictures enhance or add depth to the text.&quot; Using this definition, the first illustrated children&#x27;s book is considered to be &quot;Orbis Pictus&quot; which was published in 1658 by the Moravian author Comenius. Acting as a kind of encyclopedia, &quot;Orbis Pictus&quot; had a picture on every page, followed by the name of the object in Latin and German. It was translated into English in 1659 and was used in homes and schools around Europe and Great Britain for many years.

Early children&#x27;s books, such as &quot;Orbis Pictus&quot;, were illustrated by woodcut, and many times the same image was repeated in a number of books regardless of how appropriate the illustration was for the story. Newer processes, including copper and steel engraving were first used in the 1830s. One of the first uses of Chromolithography (a way of making multi-colored prints) in a children&#x27;s book was demonstrated in &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot;, published in Germany in 1845. English illustrator Walter Crane refined its use in children&#x27;s books in the late 19th century. 

Another method of creating illustrations for children&#x27;s books was etching, used by George Cruikshank in the 1850s. By the 1860s, top artists were illustrating for children, including Crane, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, and John Tenniel. Most pictures were still black-and-white, and many color pictures were hand colored, often by children. &quot;The Essential Guide to Children&#x27;s Books and Their Creators&quot; credits Caldecott with &quot;The concept of extending the meaning of text beyond literal visualization&quot;.

Twentieth-century artists such as Kay Nielson, Edmund Dulac, and Arthur Rackham produced illustrations that are still reprinted today. Developments in printing capabilities were reflected in children&#x27;s books. After World War II, offset lithography became more refined, and painter-style illustrations, such as Brian Wildsmith&#x27;s were common by the 1950s.

&quot;Illustrators of Children&#x27;s Books, 1744–1945&quot; (Horn Book, 1947), an extensively detailed four volume work by Louise Payson Latimer, Bertha E. Mahony and Beulah Folmsbee, catalogs illustrators of children&#x27;s books over two centuries.

==Scholarship==
Professional organizations, dedicated publications, individual researchers and university courses conduct scholarship on children&#x27;s literature. Scholarship in children&#x27;s literature is primarily conducted in three different disciplinary fields: literary studies/cultural studies (literature and language departments and humanities), library and information science, and education. (Wolf, et al., 2011).

Typically, children&#x27;s literature scholars from literature departments in universities (English, German, Spanish, etc. departments), cultural studies, or in the humanities conduct literary analysis of books. This literary criticism may focus on an author, a thematic or topical concern, genre, period, or literary device and may address issues from a variety of critical stances (poststructural, postcolonial, New Criticism, psychoanalytic, new historicism, etc.). Results of this type of research are typically published as books or as articles in scholarly journals.

The field of Library and Information Science has a long history of conducting research related to children&#x27;s literature.

Most educational researchers studying children&#x27;s literature explore issues related to the use of children&#x27;s literature in classroom settings. They may also study topics such as home use, children&#x27;s out-of-school reading, or parents&#x27; use of children&#x27;s books. Teachers typically use children&#x27;s literature to augment classroom instruction.

== Translation of children&#x27;s literature ==
Translation of children&#x27;s literature can emerge in various forms and necessitates to have a comprehension of the children&#x27;s inner worlds and developmental factors. Hollindale in 1997 takes the attention on the experimental, dynamic, imaginative, interactive, and unstable nature of childness. Considering that the translation is carried out for children consequently requires to the necessities of the youngest readers and thus, the target text can be expected to involve considering effective content, creativity, the simplest of expression, and linguistic playfulness.

Beyond age considerations, in the translation of children&#x27;s literature, the translators are supposed to comprehend the changing status and essence of youth cultures. This arises from the phenomena that works translated for children can be fictions fundamentally produced both for adults and children, consisting of genres such as romances, fables, and fairytales. Besides, adults might be present in literary works for children as the disguise of a didactic narrator or ironic asides. This can have the power to change the implicit adult-child relationship in the source text. The visuals play an important role in children&#x27;s literature for younger audience and these visuals might consist of comics, graphic novels, and picture books. Therefore, the translators are required to have an understanding of typography, visual coding and stylization.

Accordingly, comprehending the multi-medial nature of children&#x27;s literature and grasping how to compose text and images for promoting active child readers are fundamental for translators to produce effective target texts. Scholars such as Oittinen suggests that translators of children&#x27;s literature would benefit from having a specialized training in arts along with translation studies. Puurtinen and Kreller highlights other aspects such as of sound, narrative structure, syntactic alterations, and textual elements like repetition and rhyme and they suggest these components possess crucial roles in translating children&#x27;s literature. It can be said that these suggestions are being further on through critical developments such as edited volumes, reviews, and collections in the field opening the path for future research directions.

==Distribution==

The US reported revenue of US$4.7 billion from children&#x27;s books in 2020, followed by Germany (US$2 billion), the UK (US$508 million), Spain (US$427 million) and France (US$406 million).

==Literary criticism==

Controversies often emerge around the content and characters of prominent children&#x27;s books. Well-known classics that remain popular throughout decades commonly become criticized by critics and readers as the values of contemporary culture change. Critical analysis of children&#x27;s literature is common through children&#x27;s literary journals as well as published collections of essays contributed to by psychoanalysts, scholars and various literary critics such as Peter Hunt.

=== Debate over controversial content ===
A widely discussed and debated topic by critics and publishers in the children&#x27;s book industry is whether outdated and offensive content, specifically racial stereotypes, should be changed in new editions. Others argue instead that original content should remain but that publishers should add information to guide parents in conversations with their children about the problematic elements of the particular story. Some see racist stereotypes as cultural artifacts that should be preserved. In &quot;The Children&#x27;s Culture Reader&quot;, scholar Henry Jenkins references Herbert R. Kohl&#x27;s essay &quot;Should We Burn Babar?&quot; which raises the debate whether children should be educated on how to think critically towards oppressive ideologies rather than ignore historical mistakes. Jenkins suggests that parents and educators should trust children to make responsible judgments.

Some books have been altered in newer editions and significant changes can be seen, such as illustrator Richard Scarry&#x27;s book &quot;Best Word Book Ever&quot;. and Roald Dahl&#x27;s book &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. In other cases classics have been rewritten into updated versions by new authors and illustrators. Several versions of &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; have been remade as more appropriate and without prejudice.

===Stereotypes, racism and cultural bias===

Popular classics such as &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; have been criticized for their racial stereotyping.

The academic journal &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature Review&quot; provides critical analysis of many well known children&#x27;s books. In its 114th volume, the journal discusses the cultural stereotypes in Belgian cartoonist Herge&#x27;s &quot;Tintin&quot; series in reference to its depiction of people from the Congo.

After the scramble for Africa which occurred between the years of 1881 and 1914 there was a large production of children&#x27;s literature which attempted to create an illusion of what life was like for those who lived on the African continent. This was a simple technique in deceiving those who only relied on stories and secondary resources. Resulting in a new age of books which put a &quot;gloss&quot; on imperialism and its teachings at the time. Thus encouraging the idea that the colonies who were part of the African continent were perceived as animals, savages and inhuman-like. Therefore, needing cultured higher class Europeans to share their knowledge and resources with the locals. Also promoting the idea that the people within these places were as exotic as the locations themselves. Examples of these books include:
*Lou lou chez les negres (1929) – Lou Lou among the blacks
*Baba Diène et Morceau-de-Sucre (1939)
*Babar series promoting the French civilizing mission (1931)
*Tintin au Congo (1931) – Tintin goes to teach lessons in Congo about their country, Belgium

&quot;The Five Chinese Brothers&quot;, written by Claire Huchet Bishop and illustrated by Kurt Wiese has been criticized for its stereotypical caricatures of Chinese people. Helen Bannerman&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Little Black Sambo&quot; and Florence Kate Upton&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg&quot; have also been noted for their racist and controversial depictions. The term &quot;sambo&quot;, a racial slur from the American South caused a widespread banning of Bannerman&#x27;s book. Author Julius Lester and illustrator Jerry Pinkney revised the story as &quot;Sam and the Tigers: A New Telling of Little Black Sambo&quot;, making its content more appropriate and empowering for ethnic minority children. Feminist theologian Eske Wollrad claimed Astrid Lindgren&#x27;s &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; novels &quot;have colonial racist stereotypes&quot;, urging parents to skip specific offensive passages when reading to their children. Criticisms of the 1911 novel &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; by author Frances Hodgson Burnett claim endorsement of racist attitudes toward black people through the dialogue of main character Mary Lennox. Hugh Lofting&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Doctor Dolittle&quot; has been accused of &quot;white racial superiority&quot;, by implying through its underlying message that an ethnic minority person is less than human.

The picture book &quot;The Snowy Day&quot;, written and illustrated by Ezra Jack Keats was published in 1962 and is known as the first picture book to portray an African-American child as a protagonist. Middle Eastern and Central American protagonists still remain underrepresented in North American picture books. According to the Cooperative Children&#x27;s Books Center (CCBC) at University of Wisconsin Madison, which has been keeping statistics on children&#x27;s books since the 1980s, in 2016, out of 3,400 children&#x27;s books received by the CCBC that year, only 278 were about Africans or African Americans. Additionally, only 92 of the books were written by Africans or African Americans. In his interview in the book &quot;Ways of Telling: Conversations on the Art of the Picture Book&quot;, Jerry Pinkney mentioned how difficult it was to find children&#x27;s books with black children as characters. In the literary journal &quot;The Black Scholar&quot;, Bettye I. Latimer has criticized popular children&#x27;s books for their renditions of people as almost exclusively white, and notes that &quot;Dr. Seuss&quot; books contain few ethnic minority people. The popular school readers &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; which ran from the 1930s until the 1970s, are known for their whitewashed renditions of the North American nuclear family as well as their highly gendered stereotypes. The first black family did not appear in the series until the 1960s, thirty years into its run.

Writer Mary Renck Jalongo In &quot;Young Children and Picture Books&quot; discusses damaging stereotypes of Native Americans in children&#x27;s literature, stating repeated depictions of indigenous people as living in the 1800s with feathers and face paint cause children to mistake them as fictional and not as people that still exist today. The depictions of Native American people in Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot; are widely discussed among critics. Wilder&#x27;s novel, based on her childhood in America&#x27;s midwest in the late 1800s, portrays Native Americans as racialized stereotypes and has been banned in some classrooms. In her essay, &quot;Somewhere Outside the Forest: Ecological Ambivalence in Neverland from The Little White Bird to Hook&quot;, writer M. Lynn Byrd describes how the natives of Neverland in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; are depicted as &quot;uncivilized&quot;, valiant fighters unafraid of death and are referred to as &quot;redskins&quot;, which is now considered a racial slur.

===Imperialism and colonialism===
The presence of empire as well as pro-colonialist and imperialist themes in children&#x27;s literature have been identified in some of the most well known children&#x27;s classics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

In the French illustrator Jean de Brunhoff&#x27;s 1931 picture book &quot;Histoire de Babar, le petit elephant (The Story of Babar, The Little Elephant)&quot;, prominent themes of imperialism and colonialism have been noted and identified as propaganda. An allegory for French colonialism, Babar easily assimilates himself into the bourgeois lifestyle. It is a world where the elephants who have adapted themselves dominate the animals who have not yet been assimilated into the new and powerful civilization. H. A. Rey and Margret Rey&#x27;s &quot;Curious George&quot; first published in 1941 has been criticized for its blatant slave and colonialist narratives. Critics claim the man with the yellow hat represents a colonialist poacher of European descent who kidnaps George, a monkey from Africa, and sends him on a ship to America. Details such as the man in colonialist uniform and Curious George&#x27;s lack of tail are points in this argument. In an article, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; interprets it as a &quot;barely disguised slave narrative.&quot; Rudyard Kipling, the author of &quot;Just So Stories&quot; and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; has also been accused of colonial prejudice attitudes. Literary critic Jean Webb, among others, has pointed out the presence of British imperialist ideas in &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. Colonialist ideology has been identified as a prominent element in Peter Pan by critics.

===Gender roles and representation of women===
Some of the earliest children&#x27;s stories that contain feminist themes are Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot; and Frank L. Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. With many women of this period being represented in children&#x27;s books as doing housework, these two books deviated from this pattern. Drawing attention to the perception of housework as oppressive is one of the earliest forms of the feminist movement. &quot;Little Women&quot;, a story about four sisters, is said to show power of women in the home and is seen as both conservative and radical in nature. The character of Jo is observed as having a rather contemporary personality and has even been seen as a representation of the feminist movement. It has been suggested that the feminist themes in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; result from influence of Baum&#x27;s mother-in law, Matilda Gage, an important figure in the suffragist movement. Baum&#x27;s significant political commentary on capitalism, and racial oppression are also said to be part of Gage&#x27;s influence. Examples made of these themes is the main protagonist, Dorothy who is punished by being made to do housework. Another example made of positive representations of women is in Finnish author Tove Jansson&#x27;s Moomin series which features strong and individualized female characters. In recent years, there has been a surge in the production and availability of feminist children&#x27;s literature as well as a rise in gender neutrality in children&#x27;s literature.

In addition to perpetuating stereotypes about appropriate behavior and occupations for women and girls, children&#x27;s books frequently lack female characters entirely, or include them only as minor or unimportant characters. In the book &quot;Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children&#x27;s Classics&quot;, scholar Alison Lurie says most adventure novels of the 20th century, with few exceptions, contain boy protagonists while female characters in books such as those by Dr. Seuss, would typically be assigned the gender-specific roles of receptionists and nurses. The &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; characters written by A. A. Milne, are primarily male, with the exception of the character Kanga, who is a mother to Roo. Even animals and inanimate objects are usually identified as being male in children&#x27;s books. The near-absence of significant female characters is paradoxical because of the role of women in creating children&#x27;s literature. According to an article published in the &quot;Guardian&quot; in 2011, by Allison Flood, &quot;Looking at almost 6,000 children&#x27;s books published between 1900 and 2000, the study, led by Janice McCabe, a professor of sociology at Florida State University, found that males are central characters in 57% of children&#x27;s books published each year, with just 31% having female central characters. Male animals are central characters in 23% of books per year, the study found, while female animals star in only 7.5%&quot;.

On the one hand &quot;Growing up with Dick and Jane&quot; highlights the heterosexual, nuclear family and also points out the gender-specific duties of the mother, father, brother and sister, while &quot;Young Children and Picture Books&quot;, on the other hand, encourages readers to avoid books with women who are portrayed as inactive and unsuccessful as well as intellectually inferior and subservient to their fellow male characters to avoid children&#x27;s books that have repressive and sexist stereotypes for women.

In her book &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature: From the fin de siècle to the new millennium&quot;, professor Kimberley Reynolds claims gender division stayed in children&#x27;s books prominently until the 1990s. She also says that capitalism encourages gender-specific marketing of books and toys. For example, adventure stories have been identified as being for boys and domestic fiction intended for girls. Publishers often believe that boys will not read stories about girls, but that girls will read stories about both boys and girls; therefore, a story that features male characters is expected to sell better. The interest in appealing to boys is also seen in the Caldecott awards, which tend to be presented to books that are believed to appeal to boys. Reynolds also says that both boys and girls have been presented by limited representations of appropriate behaviour, identities and careers through the illustrations and text of children&#x27;s literature. She argues girls have traditionally been marketed books that prepare them for domestic jobs and motherhood. Conversely, boys are prepared for leadership roles and war. During the 20th century, more than 5,000 children&#x27;s picture books were published in the U.S; during that time, male characters outnumbered female characters by more than 3 to 2, and male animals outnumbered female animals by 3 to 1. No children&#x27;s picture book that featured a protagonist with an identifiable gender contained only female characters.

&quot;I&#x27;m Glad I&#x27;m a Boy! I&#x27;m Glad I&#x27;m a Girl!&quot; (1970) by Whitney Darrow Jr. was criticized for narrow career depictions for both boys and girls. The book informs the reader that boys are doctors, policemen, pilots, and presidents while girls are nurses, meter maids, stewardesses and first ladies.

Nancy F. Cott, once said that &quot;gender matters; that is, it matters that human beings do not appear as neuter individuals, that they exist as male or female, although this binary is always filtered through human perception. I should add that when I say gender, I am talking about meaning. I am talking about something in which interpretation is already involved.&quot;

In her book &quot;La sua barba non è poi così blu... Immaginario collettivo e violenza misogina nella fiaba di Perrault&quot; (2014, translated into Spanish &quot;Su barba no era tan azul&quot; and winner of the first international CIRSE award 2015), Angela Articoni analyzes the fairy tale Bluebeard dwelling on the sentence pronounced by the protagonist to convince herself to accept marriage, an expression that recites to repeat the women victims of violence who hope to be able to redeem their prince charming.

===Effect on early childhood development===
Bruno Bettelheim in &quot;The Uses of Enchantment&quot;, uses psychoanalysis to examine the impact that fairy tales have on the developing child. Bettelheim states the unconscious mind of a child is affected by the ideas behind a story, which shape their perception and guides their development. Likewise, author and illustrator Anthony Browne contends the early viewing of an image in a picture book leaves an important and lasting impression on a child. According to research, a child&#x27;s most crucial individual characteristics are developed in their first five years. Their environment and interaction with images in picture books have a profound impact on this development and are intended to inform a child about the world.

Children&#x27;s literature critic Peter Hunt argues that no book is innocent of harbouring an ideology of the culture it comes from. Critics discuss how an author&#x27;s ethnicity, gender and social class inform their work. Scholar Kimberley Reynolds suggests books can never be neutral as their nature is intended as instructional and by using its language, children are embedded with the values of that society. Claiming childhood as a culturally constructed concept, Reynolds states that it is through children&#x27;s literature that a child learns how to behave and to act as a child should, according to the expectations of their culture. She also attributes capitalism, in certain societies, as a prominent means of instructing especially middle class children in how to behave. The &quot;image of childhood&quot; is said to be created and perpetuated by adults to affect children &quot;at their most susceptible age&quot;. Kate Greenaway&#x27;s illustrations are used as an example of imagery intended to instruct a child in the proper way to look and behave. In Roberta Seelinger Trites&#x27;s book &quot;Disturbing the Universe: Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature&quot;, she also argues adolescence is a social construct established by ideologies present in literature. In the study &quot;The First R: How Children Learn About Race and Racism&quot;, researcher Debra Ausdale studies children in multi-ethnic daycare centres. Ausdale claims children as young as three have already entered into and begun experimenting with the race ideologies of the adult world. She asserts racist attitudes are assimilated using interactions children have with books as an example of how children internalize what they encounter in real life.

===Diversity in children&#x27;s books===
Diversity has been a key topic in children&#x27;s books and publishing in recent years, with social media movements such as We Need Diverse Books bringing this issue into the public consciousness. Books by and about marginalised groups - BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, disabled, neurodivergent, religious minorities etc. - have been underrepresented in children&#x27;s publishing. In the US, CCBC releases the numbers of children&#x27;s and YA books by and about BIPOC published in the previous year. 2019 saw the following stats:
*Black/African: 441 (11.9% of total books)
*First/Native Nations: 37 (1% of total books)
*Asian/Asian American: 325 (8.7% of total books)
*Latinx: 197 (5.3% of total books)
*Pacific Islander: 2 (0.05% of total books)
*Brown skin: 343 (9.2% of total books)
*White: 1,555 (41.8% of total books)
*LGBTQIAP+: 115 (3.1% of total books)
*Disability: 126 (3.4% of total books)
*Animal/Other: 1,085 (29.2% of total books)
In the UK, CLPE follow a similar survey. In 2020, they found a positive increase in children&#x27;s books featuring a minority ethnic character from 10% in 2019 to 15% in 2020 and up significantly from the 4% reported in the inaugural report in 2017.
Authors of colour are not well represented in children&#x27;s authorship. In the UK, research found that:
*In 2017, fewer than 6 per cent of children&#x27;s authors and illustrators were people of colour (5.6%) 
*In 2017, less than 2 per cent of these were British people of colour (1.98%)
*Between 2007 and 2017, white children&#x27;s books creators had around twice as many books published compared to those of colour – an average of 4 books in comparison to approximately 2 books per person.

==Benefits of children&#x27;s books==
Children&#x27;s books are critical to child development, especially at preschool ages. Children have had limited engagement in social contexts at this age. Reading books will help them to prepare for future social interactions and real-life situations because reading helps language, cognitive, social, and emotional development.

Children&#x27;s books increase language development by introducing new vocabulary and helping children to learn about using language in context. Children are also exposed to various words and sentence structures when reading. Moreover, children&#x27;s books enhance children&#x27;s cognitive development in memory, attention, and imagination. Reading allows them to relate to their experience and understanding to make meaning of the sensory message, which is how the brain understands the world around them. Children&#x27;s books also benefit children&#x27;s social and emotional development. Reading books help &quot;personal development and self-understanding by presenting situations and characters with which our own can be compared&quot;. Children&#x27;s books often present topics that children can relate to, such as love, empathy, family affection, and friendship. Reading those books helps children to understand emotion and helps them transfer their learning to social contexts.

<text>The 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, also known simply as the Dismissal, culminated on 11 November 1975 with the dismissal from office of the prime minister, Gough Whitlam of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), by Sir John Kerr, the Governor-General who then commissioned the leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser of the Liberal Party, as prime minister to hold a new election. It has been described as the greatest political and constitutional crisis in Australian history.

The Labor Party under Gough Whitlam came to power in the election of 1972, ending 23 consecutive years of Liberal-Country Coalition government. Labor won a majority in the House of Representatives of 67 seats to the Coalition&#x27;s 58 seats, but faced a hostile Senate. In May 1974, after the Senate voted to reject six of Labor&#x27;s non-supply bills, Whitlam advised governor-general Sir Paul Hasluck to call a double dissolution election. The election saw Labor re-elected, with its House of Representatives majority reduced from 9 to 5 seats, although it gained seats in the Senate. With the two houses of Parliament still deadlocked, pursuant to section 57 of the Australian Constitution, Whitlam was able to narrowly secure passage of the six trigger bills of the earlier double dissolution election in a joint sitting of Parliament on 6–7 August 1974, the only such sitting held in Australia&#x27;s history.

Whitlam&#x27;s tenure in office proved highly turbulent and controversial, and in October 1975, the Opposition under Malcolm Fraser used its control of the Senate to defer passage of appropriation bills needed to finance government expenditure which had already been passed by the House of Representatives. Fraser and the Opposition stated that they would continue to block supply in the Senate unless Whitlam called a fresh election for the House of Representatives, and urged Governor-General Sir John Kerr, who had been appointed governor-general on Whitlam&#x27;s advice in July 1974, to dismiss Whitlam unless he acceded to their demand. Whitlam believed that Kerr would not dismiss him as prime minister, and Kerr did nothing to make Whitlam believe that he might be dismissed.

On 11 November 1975, the crisis came to a head as Whitlam went to seek Kerr&#x27;s approval to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the parliamentary deadlock. Kerr did not accept Whitlam&#x27;s request, and instead dismissed him as prime minister and appointed Fraser as caretaker prime minister on the understanding that he would immediately call a general election. Acting quickly before all ALP parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his parliamentary allies were able to secure passage of the supply bills through the Senate and advised Kerr to dissolve Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser and his Liberal-Country Coalition were elected with a massive majority in the federal election held the following month.

The events of the Dismissal led to only minor constitutional change. The Senate retained its power to block supply, and the governor-general the power to dismiss government ministers; however, these powers have not since been used to force a government from office. Despite being denied by both Kerr and Whitlam, allegations have repeatedly been made about CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal, but remain unsubstantiated. Kerr was widely criticised by Labor supporters for his actions, resigned early as governor-general, and lived much of his remaining life abroad. 
== Background ==
=== Constitutional ===

As established by the Constitution of Australia, the Parliament of Australia is composed of two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate, together with the monarch. The monarch is represented through the governor-general. Formally, the governor-general may exercise all of the Commonwealth&#x27;s executive power; however in practice they are generally bound by convention to only act upon the advice (formal, generally binding instructions) of the prime minister and the government. The limited number of powers that may be exercised without advice and according to the discretion of the governor-general are known as the reserve powers. These powers are also governed by convention however. For example, the appointment and dismissal of the prime minister is a reserve power, however ordinarily convention dictates that only a person who has the confidence of the House of Representatives may be appointed. However, the governor-general can be removed by the prime minister through advice tendered to the monarch. 

As in most Westminster system parliaments, Australia&#x27;s government is ordinarily formed by the party enjoying the confidence of the lower house of parliament, the House of Representatives. However, Australia&#x27;s Parliament also has a powerful upper house, the Senate, which must pass any bills initiated by the House of Representatives if it is to become law. The composition of the Senate, in which each state has an equal number of senators regardless of that state&#x27;s population, was originally designed to attract the Australian colonies into one Federation. Some at the time of Federation saw the contradiction in the Constitution between responsible government, in which the executive owes its existence to the legislature or one dominant house of the legislature, and, federations with the houses of bicameral legislatures operating independently and possibly deadlocking. Certain delegates predicted that either responsible government would result in the federation becoming a unitary state or federalism would result in an executive closer to federal theory. For instance, delegate Winthrop Hackett stated at the 1891 Convention that as a result of the combination of a strong Senate with responsible government: &quot;there will be one of two alternatives—either responsible government will kill federation, or federation in the form in which we shall, I hope, be prepared to accept it, will kill responsible government&quot;.
The Constitution forbids the Senate from originating or amending a money bill, but places no limitation on the Senate&#x27;s ability to defeat one. For instance in 1970, Gough Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition, stated of a budget bill: &quot;Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is no mere formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy this Budget and destroy the Government which has sponsored it.&quot;

The Senate had never blocked supply before 1975, even when it had been controlled by the opposition. However, the Parliament of the State of Victoria had done so in 1947, in response to the federal Chifley government&#x27;s attempt to nationalise the banks. The coalition-controlled upper house blocked the state budget in order to force a premature election. Labor Premier John Cain called a snap election and was defeated.

Prior to the 1975 crisis, the governor-general&#x27;s power to dismiss a prime minister against the incumbent&#x27;s will under section 64 of the Constitution had never been exercised. Twice since Federation, conflicts between state premiers and state governors, who perform analogous functions to the prime minister and governor-general respectively at the state level, had resulted in the departure of one or the other. In 1916, New South Wales Premier William Holman was expelled from the Australian Labor Party for supporting conscription. He managed to hold on to power with the aid of opposition parties and consulted the Governor, Sir Gerald Strickland, proposing to pass legislation to extend the term of the lower house of the state legislature by a year. When Strickland objected, stating that such a course was unfair to Labor, Holman had him replaced. In 1932 the New South Wales Labor premier, Jack Lang, refused to pay money owed to the Federal government, which froze the state&#x27;s bank accounts, causing Lang to order that payments to the state government be only in cash. The governor, Sir Philip Game, wrote Lang to warn him that this was unlawful. Game further warned Lang that if Lang continued, he would have to sack Lang to obtain ministers who could carry on government within legal bounds. Lang replied that he would not resign, and Game dismissed his government and commissioned the leader of the Opposition, Bertram Stevens, to form a caretaker government pending a new election, in which Labor was defeated.

Among the powers granted to the governor-general is the power to dissolve both houses of Parliament under section 57 of the Constitution in the event that the House of Representatives twice passes a bill at least three months apart and the Senate refuses to pass it. In both instances where those circumstances arose prior to the Whitlam government, in 1914 and 1951, the governor-general dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election on the recommendation of the prime minister.

=== Political ===
Gough Whitlam&#x27;s Labor government was elected in 1972 after 23 years of rule by a coalition formed by the Liberal and Country parties. The ALP Government enjoyed a nine-seat majority in the House of Representatives, but did not control the Senate, which had been elected in 1967 and 1970 (as Senate elections were then out of synchronisation with House of Representatives elections). In accordance with pre-election promises, it instituted a large number of policy changes, and offered much legislation. The Opposition, which still controlled the Senate, allowed some government bills to pass the Senate, and blocked others.

In April 1974, faced with attempts by the Opposition under Billy Snedden to block supply (appropriation bills) in the Senate, Whitlam obtained the concurrence of the governor-general, Sir Paul Hasluck, to a double dissolution. Labor was returned at the election on 18 May with a reduced House majority of five seats. The Coalition and Labor each had 29 Senate seats, with the balance of power held by two independents. Snedden later told author Graham Freudenberg when being interviewed for the book &quot;A Certain Grandeur – Gough Whitlam in Politics&quot;: &quot;The pressure [to block supply] was on me from Anthony. We thought you had a chance of getting control of the Senate at the half-Senate election or at least enough to get a redistribution through. With a gerrymander, you&#x27;d be in forever.&quot;

Hasluck had been governor-general since 1969, and his expected term was shortly due to expire. Whitlam wanted him to remain a further two years, but Hasluck declined, citing the refusal of his wife, Alexandra, to remain at Yarralumla longer than the originally agreed five years. Whitlam offered the post to businessman Ken Myer, who turned it down. Whitlam then offered the position to his treasurer, Frank Crean, and his own deputy, Lance Barnard, neither of whom was keen to move on from parliament. Finally, Whitlam turned to his fifth choice, Sir John Kerr, the chief justice of New South Wales. Kerr was reluctant to give up the chief justiceship, in which he intended to remain another ten years, for the governor-general&#x27;s post, which traditionally lasted five years. At Kerr&#x27;s request, Whitlam informally agreed that if both men were still in office in five years, Kerr would remain governor-general for another five years. Whitlam also secured legislation to address Kerr&#x27;s financial concerns about the position, including authorising a pension for the governor-general or his widow. The leader of the Opposition, Billy Snedden, was enthusiastic about the appointment and also agreed to keep on Kerr in five years, were he prime minister at the time. Kerr then agreed to take the post, was duly appointed by Queen Elizabeth II, and was sworn in on 11 July 1974.

Six of the bills that had been the subject of the double dissolution were introduced in Parliament a third time and, as expected, were again rejected by the Senate. Section 57 of the Constitution provides that, after a double dissolution election, if bills that had been rejected twice by the Senate in the previous parliament were again passed by the House and again rejected by the Senate, they could then be put to a joint sitting of both houses. On 30 July, Whitlam gained Kerr&#x27;s agreement for a joint sitting, which was set for 6–7 August 1974. The joint sitting, the only one in Australia&#x27;s history under Section 57, passed all six bills, including the enabling legislation for Medibank.

=== Controversy and vacancies ===
In December 1974, Whitlam was anxious to find new sources of money to finance his development plans. After a meeting at the prime minister&#x27;s residence, The Lodge, Whitlam and three of his ministers (Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer Jim Cairns, Attorney-General Senator Lionel Murphy, and Minister for Minerals and Energy Rex Connor) signed a letter of authority for Connor to borrow up to US$4 billion. This letter was described by author and journalist Alan Reid as the &quot;death warrant of the Whitlam ALP government&quot;.

Connor and other ministers had made contact with a hitherto obscure Pakistani financier, Tirath Khemlani, as early as November 1974. Khemlani was said to have contacts in the newly enriched Arab oil nations. None of the efforts to secure a loan, whether through Khemlani or by other routes, bore fruit, but, as information about the &quot;Loans Affair&quot; trickled out, the government lost support.

In February 1975, Whitlam decided to appoint Senator Murphy a justice of the High Court of Australia, even though Murphy&#x27;s Senate seat would not be up for election if a half-Senate election were held. Under the Senate&#x27;s electoral system, Labor could win three of the five New South Wales seats, but if Murphy&#x27;s seat was also contested, it was most unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy would almost certainly cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state parliaments to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis, a member of the Liberal Party, argued that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent.

By March 1975, many Liberal parliamentarians felt that Snedden was doing an inadequate job as Leader of the Opposition and that Whitlam was dominating him in the House of Representatives. Malcolm Fraser challenged Snedden for the leadership on 21 March, and defeated him by 37 votes to 27. At a press conference after winning the leadership, Fraser stated:

Whitlam&#x27;s original deputy prime minister, Lance Barnard, had been challenged and defeated for his post by Cairns in June 1974 shortly after the May 1974 election. Whitlam then offered Barnard a diplomatic post; in early 1975 Barnard agreed to this. If the appointment went through, Barnard&#x27;s resignation from the House of Representatives would trigger a by-election in his Tasmanian electorate of Bass. ALP officials felt that, given the party&#x27;s weakened state, Barnard should remain in Parliament and be given no preferment if he resigned; party president and future Prime Minister Bob Hawke described the decision to appoint Barnard as &quot;an act of lunacy&quot;. Barnard had been losing support over the last several elections, and the Liberals needed only a swing of 4% to take Bass off Labor. The Liberals had a candidate, Kevin Newman, who had been nursing the electorate; Labor had no candidate selected and a bitter preselection in the offing. Barnard resigned and was appointed the ambassador to Sweden. The election on 28 June proved a disaster for Labor, with Newman winning the seat on a swing of over 17%.

The next week, Whitlam fired Cairns for misleading Parliament regarding the Loans Affair amid innuendo about his relationship with his Principal Private Secretary, Junie Morosi. He was replaced as deputy by Frank Crean. At the time of Cairns&#x27; dismissal, one Senate seat was vacant, following the death on 30 June of Queensland ALP Senator Bertie Milliner. The state Labor party nominated Mal Colston, who was the highest unelected candidate on the party&#x27;s Queensland list in 1974. This resulted in deadlock in Brisbane; the unicameral Queensland Parliament twice voted against Colston, and the party refused to submit any alternative candidates. Queensland Country Party Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen had evidence that Colston, a schoolteacher by trade, had set a school on fire during a labour dispute, though the police had refused to prosecute. After the Queensland Parliament voted Colston down a second time, Bjelke-Petersen instructed his majority in the Queensland Parliament to elect a low-level union official, Albert Field, who had contacted his office and expressed a willingness to serve. In interviews, Field made it clear he would not support Whitlam. Field was expelled from the ALP for standing against Colston, and Labor senators boycotted his swearing-in. Whitlam argued that because of the vacancies being filled as they were, the Senate was &quot;corrupted&quot; and &quot;tainted&quot;, with the Opposition enjoying a majority they did not win at the ballot box. When Labor learned that Field had not given the required three weeks notice to the Queensland Department of Education, it challenged his appointment in the High Court, arguing that he was still technically a public servant–and thus ineligible to serve in the Senate. With Field on leave throughout the remainder of the crisis, the Coalition refused to provide a pair to account for his absence, giving it an effective majority of 30–29 in the Senate. Whitlam remarked that if Milliner had not died or had he been replaced by a pro-Whitlam senator, the crisis would not have happened.

== Deadlock ==
=== Deferral of supply ===

On 10 October, the High Court ruled that the act passed at the joint sitting that gave the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory two senators each was valid. A half-Senate election needed to be held by June 1976; most senators-elect would take their seats on 1 July, but the territorial senators and those filling Field&#x27;s and Bunton&#x27;s seats would take their places at once. The ruling meant that it was possible for the ALP to gain a temporary majority in the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976. To do so, the ALP would have to win Field&#x27;s and Bunton&#x27;s seats, and one seat in each territory, and have the second ACT seat fall to either a Labor candidate or an independent, former Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton, now estranged from his party. If this happened, Labor would have an effective 33–31 margin, would be able to pass supply if that was still an issue, and also could pass electoral redistribution laws (which had been passed by the House, though twice defeated by the Senate) that would give it an advantage at the next election.

In the wake of the High Court ruling, and with the appropriation bills due to be considered by the Senate on 16 October, Fraser was undecided whether to block supply. His biographer, Philip Ayres, contends that, had there been no further government scandals, he would not have done so. Khemlani, however, had alleged – contrary to government statements – that Connor had never revoked his authority to obtain loans and had been in regular contact with him even into mid-1975. On 13 October, the Melbourne &quot;Herald&quot; printed documents in support of Khemlani&#x27;s allegations, and on the following day, Connor resigned. Fraser determined to block supply, convened a shadow cabinet meeting and received the unanimous support of the Coalition frontbench. At a press conference, Fraser cited the poor state of the economy and the continuing scandals as reasons for his decision. Without the passage of fresh appropriations, supply would be exhausted on 30 November.

On 15 October the Governor of Queensland, Sir Colin Hannah, gave a speech denigrating the Whitlam government, in violation of the convention that state governors remain neutral. Hannah held a dormant commission as Administrator of the Commonwealth to act as Governor-General in the event of Kerr&#x27;s death, resignation, or absence from Australia. Whitlam immediately contacted Buckingham Palace to arrange for Hannah&#x27;s dormant commission to be revoked, a process which took ten days to complete. Although Whitlam later alleged that he never contemplated dismissing Kerr during the crisis, on 16 October, while speaking with Kerr and visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, he told Kerr that if the crisis continued, &quot;It could be a question of whether I get to the Queen first for your recall, or whether you get in first with my dismissal.&quot; Kerr saw the statement as a threat; Whitlam later stated the comment was &quot;flippant&quot; and designed to turn the conversation to another subject.

On 16 and 17 October, the Senate, with the unanimous support of the Coalition majority, deferred the appropriation bills. In response to the blockage, Whitlam asserted that the Senate was acting against long-standing constitutional principles. On 16 October, a government endorsed a motion passed in the House stating that the Senate actions was &quot;a gross violation&quot; of conventions that placed the responsibility of the supply of money in the hands of the House of Representatives. The Opposition controlled Senate rejected this contention, moving a motion that denied that any such convention existed.

The Coalition took the position that Kerr could dismiss Whitlam if the Government could not secure supply. Whitlam&#x27;s former solicitor-general Bob Ellicott, now a Liberal member of the House, issued a legal opinion on 16 October stating that the Governor-General had the power to dismiss Whitlam, and should do so forthwith if Whitlam could not state how he would obtain supply. Ellicott indicated that Whitlam was treating Kerr as if he had no discretion but to follow prime ministerial advice, when in fact the Governor-General could and should dismiss a ministry unable to secure supply. Ellicott stated that Kerr

Journalist and author Paul Kelly, who wrote two books on the crisis, argues that Whitlam was motivated by a desire to bring about de facto constitutional change, with the House of Representatives gaining dominance over the Senate:
=== Consultations and negotiations ===
Kerr&#x27;s major confidant and secret adviser regarding the dismissal was a member of the High Court and friend of Kerr, Sir Anthony Mason whose role was not revealed until 2012 when Whitlam&#x27;s biographer Jenny Hocking detailed Kerr&#x27;s archival record of their extensive consultations. Kerr described Mason as playing &quot;a most significant part in my thinking&quot; and wrote of confiding in Mason &quot;to fortify myself for the action I was to take&quot;. Mason&#x27;s role included drafting a letter of dismissal for Kerr and he also claimed to have advised Kerr that he should &quot;as a matter of fairness&quot; warn Whitlam of his intention to dismiss him, which Kerr refused to do. Mason writes that his discussions with Kerr began in August 1975 and concluded on the afternoon of 11 November 1975. He declined Kerr&#x27;s requests to allow his role to be publicly known. Kerr rang Whitlam on Sunday 19 October, asking permission to consult with the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Garfield Barwick, concerning the crisis. Whitlam advised Kerr not to do so, noting that no Governor-General had consulted with a Chief Justice under similar circumstances since 1914, when Australia was at a much earlier stage of her constitutional development. Whitlam also noted that in all of the recent unsuccessful High Court challenges to Whitlam government legislation, Barwick had been in the minority in finding against the government. On 21 October, Kerr phoned Whitlam regarding the Ellicott opinion, and asked, &quot;It&#x27;s all bullshit, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;. Whitlam agreed with Kerr&#x27;s view. Kerr then requested that the Government provide him with a written legal opinion rebutting Ellicott&#x27;s views. Kerr would receive no written advice from the Government until 6 November. Paul Kelly paints this delay as a major mistake by Whitlam, given Kerr&#x27;s judicial background. Kerr also asked on 21 October for Whitlam&#x27;s permission to interview Fraser, which the Prime Minister readily granted, and the two men met that night. Fraser told Kerr that the Opposition were determined to block supply. Fraser indicated that the Opposition&#x27;s decision to defer the appropriation bills, rather than defeating them, was a tactical decision, since then the bills would remain in the control of the Senate and could be passed at any time. He stated that the Coalition agreed with the Ellicott opinion, and proposed to continue deferring supply while it awaited events. The media were not told of the substance of the conversation, and instead reported that Kerr had reprimanded Fraser for blocking supply, causing the Governor-General&#x27;s office to issue a denial.

Throughout the crisis, Kerr did not tell Whitlam of his increasing concerns, nor did he suggest that he might dismiss Whitlam. He believed nothing he said would influence Whitlam, and feared that, if Whitlam perceived him as a possible opponent, the Prime Minister would procure his dismissal from the Queen. Accordingly, though Kerr dealt with Whitlam in an affable manner, he did not confide his thinking to the Prime Minister. Labor Senator Tony Mulvihill later related that &quot;Whitlam would come back to each caucus meeting and say, &#x27;I saw His Excellency ... No worry. He&#x27;s got to do it his way.&#x27; ... at no time did he hint that the Governor-General was frowning.&quot;

There was intense public interest and concern at the stalemate, and Fraser and his Liberals acted to shore up support. Liberal frontbenchers worked to build unity for the tactic in state organisations. The former longtime Premier of South Australia Sir Thomas Playford was speaking out against the blocking of supply, causing South Australia Senator Don Jessop to waver in his support for the tactic. Fraser was able to co-ordinate a wave of communications from party members which served to neutralise both men. Fraser sought the backing of the retired longtime Liberal Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, and went to see Menzies in person, taking with him a 1947 statement by Menzies supporting the blocking of supply in the upper house of the Victorian Parliament. He did not have to use the paper; Menzies stated that he found the tactic distasteful, but in this case necessary. The former prime minister issued a statement in support of Fraser&#x27;s tactics.

Kerr invited Whitlam and Minister for Labour Senator Jim McClelland to lunch on 30 October, immediately preceding an Executive Council meeting. At that meal, Kerr proposed a possible compromise. If the Opposition were to allow supply to pass, Whitlam would not advise a half-Senate election until May or June 1976, and the Senate would not convene until 1 July, thus obviating the threat of a possible temporary Labor majority. Whitlam, who was determined to destroy both Fraser&#x27;s leadership and the Senate&#x27;s right to block supply, refused any compromise.

=== Decision ===
Fraser chaired a summit of leaders of the Coalition parties on 2 November. The resulting communiqué urged the Coalition senators to continue deferring supply. It also threatened, should Kerr grant Whitlam a half-Senate election, that the Coalition state premiers would advise their governors not to issue writs, thus blocking the election from taking place in the four states with non-Labor premiers. After the meeting, Fraser proposed a compromise: that the Opposition would concede supply if Whitlam agreed to hold a House of Representatives election at the same time as the half-Senate election. Whitlam rejected the idea.

On 22 October, Whitlam had asked the Attorney-General, Kep Enderby, to have a paper drafted rebutting the Ellicott opinion for presentation to Kerr. Enderby delegated this task to the Solicitor-General, Maurice Byers, and other officials. On 6 November, Enderby was to see Kerr to give him a legal opinion regarding the Government&#x27;s alternative plans in case supply ran out. Vouchers were to be issued to Commonwealth employees and contractors instead of cheques, to be redeemed from banks after the crisis ended—transactions which were to be rejected by major banks as &quot;tainted with illegality&quot;. Enderby decided to present Kerr with the rebuttal to Ellicott. When Enderby reviewed the document, he found that, while it argued for the Government&#x27;s position, it recognised both that the Senate had the constitutional right to block supply, and that the reserve powers were still extant—matters with which Enderby did not agree. He presented Kerr with the rebuttal, but crossed out Byers&#x27; signature on it and told Kerr of his disagreement. Enderby told Kerr that the Byers rebuttal was &quot;background&quot; for formal written advice, to be presented by Whitlam. Later that day, Kerr met with Fraser again. The Opposition leader told him that if Kerr did not dismiss Whitlam, the Opposition planned to criticise him in Parliament for failing to carry out his duty.

Kerr concluded on 6 November that neither Government nor Opposition would yield and had received advice that day from Treasurer Bill Hayden that supply would run out on 27 November. The Governor-General decided that, as Whitlam could not secure supply, and would not resign or advise an election for the House of Representatives, he would have to sack him. As Kerr feared that Whitlam might advise the Queen to dismiss him, he considered it important that Whitlam be given no hint of the impending action. Kerr later stated that were Whitlam to seek his dismissal, it would involve the Queen in politics. Seeking confirmation of his decision, he contacted Chief Justice Barwick, met with him and asked for his views of a dismissal of Whitlam. Barwick furnished him with written advice containing his view that a governor-general could and should dismiss a prime minister who was unable to obtain supply. Barwick specified that the prime minister should also not have refused either to resign or to advise a general election, with which Kerr agreed.

On 9 November, Fraser contacted Whitlam and invited him to negotiations with the Coalition aimed at settling the dispute. Whitlam agreed, and a meeting was set for 9 am on Tuesday 11 November, at Parliament House. That Tuesday was also the deadline for an election to be called if it were to be held before Christmas. Both Government and Opposition leaders were in Melbourne on the night of 10 November for the Lord Mayor&#x27;s banquet. To ensure the Opposition leaders could reach Canberra in time for the meeting, Whitlam brought them back in his VIP aircraft, which arrived in Canberra at midnight.

== Dismissal ==
=== Meeting at Yarralumla ===
At 9 a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, together with deputy prime minister Frank Crean and Leader of the House Fred Daly, met with Fraser and Country Party leader Doug Anthony. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders that he would be advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13 December, and he would not be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with Remembrance Day commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00 p.m., though Kerr&#x27;s office later called Whitlam&#x27;s and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister. Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.

After hearing from Whitlam, Kerr called Fraser. According to Fraser, Kerr asked him whether he, if commissioned prime minister, could secure supply, would immediately thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and investigations of the Whitlam government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those questions were asked later in the day before Kerr commissioned Fraser as prime minister. According to Kerr, Fraser was supposed to come to Yarralumla at 1.00 pm.

Whitlam was delayed in leaving Parliament House, while Fraser left slightly early, with the result that Fraser arrived at Yarralumla first. He was taken into an anteroom, and his car was moved. Whitlam maintained that the purpose in moving Fraser&#x27;s car was to ensure that the Prime Minister was not tipped off by seeing it, stating, &quot;Had I known Mr. Fraser was already there, I would not have set foot in Yarralumla.&quot; Kelly doubted Whitlam would have recognised Fraser&#x27;s car, which was an ordinary Ford LTD from the car pool. According to Fraser biographer Philip Ayres, &quot;A white car pulled up at the front would signify nothing in particular—it would simply be in the way.&quot;

Whitlam arrived just before 1:00 p.m. and was taken to Kerr&#x27;s office by an aide. He brought with him the formal letter advising a half-Senate election, and after the two men were seated, attempted to give it to Kerr. According to Kerr, he interrupted Whitlam and asked if, as a result of the failure to find a compromise between party leaders, he intended to govern without parliamentary supply, to which the Prime Minister answered, &quot;Yes&quot;. In their accounts of their meeting, both men agree that Kerr then told Whitlam about the decision to withdraw his commission as prime minister under section 64 of the Constitution. Kerr later wrote that at this point Whitlam got to his feet, looked at the office&#x27;s phones, and stated, &quot;I must get in touch with the Palace at once.&quot; According to Kerr, this indicated that Whitlam would not try to negotiate with him about a general election but contact the Queen for his recall, which gave him the final reason to carry out the dismissal; he answered that it was too late to get in touch with the Palace because Whitlam was not prime minister any more. Whitlam, however, later disputed that such words were spoken, and stated that he asked Kerr whether he had consulted the Palace, to which Kerr replied that he did not need to, and that he had the advice of Barwick. Both accounts agree that Kerr then handed Whitlam a letter of dismissal and statement of reasons, stating that they would both have to live with this, to which Whitlam replied, &quot;&quot;You&quot; certainly will.&quot; The dismissal concluded with Kerr wishing Whitlam luck in the election, and offering his hand, which the former prime minister took.

Kerr&#x27;s statement of reasons read:

After Whitlam left, Kerr called Fraser in, informed him of the dismissal, and asked if he would form a caretaker government, to which Fraser agreed. Fraser later stated that his overwhelming sensation at the news was relief. Fraser left to return to Parliament House, where he conferred with Coalition leaders, while Kerr joined the luncheon party that had been waiting for him, apologising to his guests and offering the excuse that he had been busy dismissing the Government.

=== Parliamentary strategy ===
Whitlam returned to The Lodge, where he had lunch. When his aides arrived, he informed them of his sacking. Whitlam drafted a resolution for the House, expressing confidence in his Government. No ALP Senate leaders were at The Lodge, nor did Whitlam and his party contact any when they drove back to Parliament House, confining their strategy to the House of Representatives.

Prior to Whitlam&#x27;s dismissal, the Labor leadership decided to introduce a motion that the Senate pass the appropriation bills. With ALP senators unaware of Whitlam&#x27;s sacking, that plan went ahead. Senator Doug McClelland, manager of the ALP Government&#x27;s business in the Senate, informed Coalition Senate leader Reg Withers of Labor&#x27;s intent at about 1.30 pm. Withers then attended a leadership meeting where he learned of Fraser&#x27;s appointment and assured the new prime minister he could secure supply. When the Senate convened, the ALP Senate leader, Ken Wriedt, made the motion to pass the appropriation bills. As Wriedt did so, he was told that the government had been sacked, which he initially refused to believe. Authoritative word did not reach Wriedt until 2.15 pm, by which time it was too late to withdraw the motion and instead obstruct his party&#x27;s appropriation bill to hinder Fraser. At 2.24 pm, Labor&#x27;s appropriation bills passed the Senate, fulfilling Fraser&#x27;s first promise of providing supply.

In the House, desultory debate on Fraser&#x27;s censure motion ended with it being amended by the ALP majority into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34 pm, when Fraser rose and announced that he had been commissioned as prime minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House adjourn. His motion was defeated. Fraser&#x27;s new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a motion of no confidence in him, and asked the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. Scholes, attempting to communicate this to the Governor-General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House and tell them of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45 pm.

=== Dissolution ===
After the appropriation bills were approved by both Houses, they were sent over to Yarralumla where Kerr gave them royal assent. With supply assured, Kerr then received Fraser, who advised him that 21 bills (including the electoral redistribution bills) which had been introduced since the last election fulfilled the double dissolution provisions of section 57. Fraser asked that both Houses be dissolved for an election on 13 December. Kerr signed the proclamation dissolving Parliament, and sent his Official Secretary, David Smith, to proclaim the dissolution from the front steps of Parliament House.

At 4.45, Kerr received Scholes, and informed him of the dissolution. Kerr wrote that &quot;nothing else of relevance&quot; took place between the two men, but Scholes&#x27;s account is that he accused Kerr of bad faith for making an appointment to receive the Speaker, and then not waiting to hear from him before dissolving Parliament. Whitlam later stated that it would have been wiser for Scholes to take the appropriation bills with him, rather than having them sent ahead. Kerr&#x27;s action was based on the advice he had received from two High Court judges (Mason and Chief Justice Barwick) and the Crown Law Officers (Byers and Clarence Harders, the Secretary of the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department).

As Scholes and Kerr spoke, Smith reached Parliament House. The dismissal was by then publicly known, and an angry crowd of ALP supporters had gathered, filling the steps and spilling over both into the roadway and into Parliament House itself. Many of the demonstrators were ALP staffers; others were from the Australian National University. Smith was forced to enter Parliament House through a side door and make his way to the steps from the inside. He read the proclamation, though the boos of the crowd drowned him out, and concluded with the traditional &quot;God save the Queen&quot;. Former Prime Minister Whitlam, who had been standing behind Smith, then addressed the crowd:

== Aftermath ==
=== Campaign ===
The news that Whitlam had been dismissed spread across Australia during the afternoon, triggering immediate protest demonstrations. On 12 November, Scholes wrote to the Queen, asking her to restore Whitlam as prime minister. The reply from her private secretary, Sir Martin Charteris, dated 17 November 1975, stated:

On 12 November 1975, the First Fraser Ministry was sworn in by Kerr. By some accounts, Kerr sought reassurance at that meeting that the Coalition senators would not have given in before supply ran out, &quot;The Senate would never have caved in, would it?&quot; According to those accounts, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle laughed and said to a colleague, &quot;That&#x27;s all he knows&quot;. Guilfoyle later stated that, if she did make such a remark, it was not meant to imply that the Coalition senators would have broken. However, Kelly lists four Coalition senators who stated, in subsequent years, that they would have crossed the floor and voted for the appropriation bills.

Labor believed it had a chance of winning the election, and that the dismissal would be an electoral asset for them. However, some Labor strategists believed the party was heading for a disaster, with few economic accomplishments to point to and an electorate whose emotions would have cooled before polling day. Nonetheless, Whitlam, who began campaigning almost immediately after the dismissal, was met with huge crowds wherever he went; 30,000 people overspilled the Sydney Domain for the official campaign launch on 24 November. That evening, Whitlam made a major speech at Festival Hall in Melbourne before 7,500 people and a national TV audience, calling 11 November &quot;Fraser&#x27;s day of shame—a day that will live in infamy&quot;.

Polls were released at the end of the first week of campaigning, and showed a nine-point swing against Labor. Whitlam&#x27;s campaign did not believe it at first, but additional polling made it clear that the electorate was turning against the ALP. The Coalition attacked Labor for the economic conditions, and released television commercials &quot;The Three Dark Years&quot; showing images from the Whitlam government scandals. The ALP campaign, which had concentrated on the issue of Whitlam&#x27;s dismissal, did not begin to address the economy until its final days. By that time Fraser, confident of victory, was content to sit back, avoid specifics and make no mistakes. There was little violence in the campaign, but three letter bombs were placed in the post; one wounded two people in Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s office, while the other two, addressed to Kerr and Fraser, were intercepted and defused.

During the campaign, the Kerrs purchased a Sydney apartment, as Sir John was prepared to resign in the event that the ALP triumphed. In the 13 December election, the Coalition won a record victory, with 91 seats in the House of Representatives to the ALP&#x27;s 36 and a 35–27 majority in the expanded Senate.

=== Reactions ===
The dismissal is considered the greatest political and constitutional crisis in Australia&#x27;s history. In 1977, the Fraser government proposed four constitutional amendments via referendum, three of which passed—the last time that the Australian Constitution has been amended. One of the amendments requires that a senator appointed to fill a casual vacancy be from the same party as the former senator. The Senate retains the power to block supply; the governor-general retains the power to dismiss a prime minister. However, these powers have not since been used to force a government from office.

In the wake of the dismissal, the ALP turned its anger on Kerr. Demonstrations marked his appearances, while the remaining ALP parliamentarians boycotted his opening of the new parliament. Whitlam, now Leader of the Opposition, refused all invitations to events at Yarralumla, which the Kerrs continued to extend until his refusal of an invitation during the Queen&#x27;s 1977 visit caused them to feel that no further efforts need be made. Whitlam never spoke with Kerr again. Even ALP parliamentarians who had been friends of Kerr broke off their relationships, feeling Kerr had betrayed the party and had ambushed Whitlam. Lady Kerr stated that she and her husband confronted a &quot;new irrational scene swarming with instant enemies&quot;.

Whitlam repeatedly castigated Kerr for his role in the dismissal. When Kerr announced his resignation as governor-general on 14 July 1977, Whitlam commented: &quot;How fitting that the last of the Bourbons should bow out on Bastille Day&quot;. After Kerr resigned as governor-general, he still sought a government position, reasoning that it had been his intent to remain for ten years as governor-general. However, Fraser&#x27;s attempt to appoint Kerr as ambassador to UNESCO (a position later held by Whitlam) provoked such public outcry that the nomination was withdrawn. The Kerrs spent the next several years living in Europe, and when he died in Australia in 1991, his death was not announced until after he was buried. In 1991, Whitlam stated that no future governor-general was likely to act as Kerr did lest he also became the subject of &quot;contempt and isolation&quot;. In 1997 he said that the letter of dismissal &quot;had the shortcomings of being &quot;ex tempore&quot;, &quot;ex parte&quot;, &quot;ad hoc&quot; and &quot;sub rosa&quot;&quot;. In 2005, Whitlam called Kerr &quot;a contemptible person&quot;. On the other hand, Country Party leader and deputy prime minister Doug Anthony said: &quot;I can&#x27;t forgive Gough for crucifying him&quot;. Sir Garfield Barwick was not spared Whitlam&#x27;s invective; the former prime minister described him as &quot;evil&quot;. Though denied by both Kerr and Whitlam, unsubstantiated allegations have been made about CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal.

Whitlam resigned as ALP leader after the party suffered its second successive electoral defeat in 1977. Fraser served over seven years as prime minister, and left the Liberal leadership after the Coalition was defeated in the March 1983 election. Years later, Whitlam and Fraser put aside their differences; Whitlam wrote in 1997 that Fraser &quot;did not set out to deceive me&quot;. The two campaigned together in support of the 1999 referendum that would have made Australia a republic. According to Whitlam speechwriter Graham Freudenberg, &quot;the residual rage over the conduct of the Queen&#x27;s representative found a constructive outlet in the movement for the Australian Republic&quot;.

Freudenberg summed up Kerr&#x27;s fate after the dismissal:

=== Assessment ===
In his 1995 survey of the events of the crisis, &quot;November 1975&quot;, Kelly places blame on Fraser for initiating the crisis and on Whitlam for using the crisis to try to break Fraser and the Senate. However, he places the most blame on Kerr, for failing to be candid with Whitlam about his intentions, and for refusing to offer a clear, final warning before dismissing him. According to Kelly,

Kerr&#x27;s predecessor as governor-general, Sir Paul Hasluck, believed that the fundamental reason for the crisis was the lack of trust and confidence between Whitlam and Kerr, and that the proper role of the governor-general had been to provide counsel, advice and warning.

Future Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating, who was Minister for Northern Australia in Whitlam&#x27;s ministry, called the dismissal a &quot;coup&quot; and raised the idea to &quot;arrest [Kerr]&quot; and &quot;lock him up&quot;, adding that he would not have &quot;[taken] it lying down&quot; if he was prime minister, during a 2013 interview with Kerry O&#x27;Brien.

== Royal involvement ==

Neither Whitlam nor Kerr ever suggested there had been any covert royal involvement. According to Whitlam&#x27;s biographer Jenny Hocking, Kerr&#x27;s papers in the National Archives of Australia reveal that he discussed with the Prince of Wales (now Charles III) his reserve powers and the possibility that he would dismiss the Whitlam government, in September 1975. Kerr asked what would happen if he dismissed Whitlam and the prime minister retaliated by dismissing him. According to Kerr, Charles had responded: &quot;But surely, Sir John, the Queen should not have to accept advice that you should be recalled at the very time when you were considering having to dismiss the government&quot;. Kerr writes in his journal that Prince Charles informed the Queen&#x27;s Private Secretary, Sir Martin Charteris, of the conversation. Charteris then wrote to Kerr to say that, should the prime minister request the recall of the governor-general, the Queen &quot;would take most unkindly to it. There would be considerable comings and goings, but ... at the end of the road The Queen, as a Constitutional Sovereign, would have no option but to follow the advice of her Prime Minister.&quot; Hocking argues the letter is alarming as &quot;the involvement of the Queen in any discussion with Kerr about his tenure unknown to the prime minister, was manifestly improper [as] the appointment and recall of a governor-general is clearly and unquestionably a decision for the Australian prime minister alone&quot;. She also suggests that the letter indicates that the palace approved of dismissal, quoting Professor Paul Rodan that &quot;Only the most obtuse of governors-general could fail to interpret [the letter] as a favourable sign&quot;. Conversely, Paul Kelly and Troy Bramstone argues against this interpretation, stating that the reference to the &quot;considerable comings and goings&quot; referred to the fact that dismissal would require written notice, not just a phone call. They argue that the letter &quot;demonstrate[s] beyond question that the Queen would remove Kerr on Whitlam&#x27;s advice&quot;.

Beginning in 2012, Hocking attempted to gain the release of correspondence between the Queen&#x27;s advisors and Kerr regarding the dismissal, held by the National Archives. In 2016, Hocking launched a federal court action against the National Archives seeking the release of the &quot;Palace letters&quot;, correspondence between Kerr, the Queen and Charteris held by the Archives but not available for view. The action was lost in the full court, but on 29 May 2020 Hocking&#x27;s appeal to the High Court succeeded: in a majority 6:1 decision the High Court held that the Palace letters are &quot;Commonwealth records&quot; (not personal property) and therefore available for public release under the provisions of the &quot;Archives Act 1983&quot;.

On 14 July 2020, the letters were released online without redaction. They revealed that, although Kerr had corresponded with Charteris about whether he had the constitutional authority to dismiss Whitlam, he had not informed the Queen in advance of his decision to do so. However, the letters also revealed that Kerr had discussed the possibility of dismissing Whitlam as early as July 1975. Also, on 2 October 1975, Sir Martin Charteris confirmed in a letter that Kerr had discussed with Prince Charles the possibility that Whitlam could ask the Queen to dismiss Kerr.

== Popular culture ==
The 1983 miniseries &quot;The Dismissal&quot; dramatised the events of the crisis. It featured Max Phipps as Whitlam, John Meillon as Kerr and John Stanton as Fraser. A musical adaptation of the events was staged by the Sydney Theatre Company in 2023.

<text>Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland (also known as Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 English children&#x27;s novel by Lewis Carroll, a mathematics don at the University of Oxford. It details the story of a girl named Alice who falls through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world of anthropomorphic creatures. It is seen as an example of the literary nonsense genre. The artist John Tenniel provided 42 wood-engraved illustrations for the book. 

It received positive reviews upon release and is now one of the best-known works of Victorian literature; its narrative, structure, characters and imagery have had a widespread influence on popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre. It is credited as helping end an era of didacticism in children&#x27;s literature, inaugurating an era in which writing for children aimed to &quot;delight or entertain&quot;. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. The titular character Alice shares her name with Alice Liddell, a girl Carroll knew—scholars disagree about the extent to which the character was based upon her.

The book has never been out of print and has been translated into 174 languages. Its legacy includes adaptations to screen, radio, visual art, ballet, opera, and musical theatre, as well as theme parks, board games and video games. Carroll published a sequel in 1871 entitled &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; and a shortened version for young children, &quot;The Nursery &quot;Alice&quot;&quot;, in 1890.

==Background==
===&quot;All in the golden afternoon...&quot;===
&quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; was conceived on 4 July 1862, when Lewis Carroll and Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed up the river Isis with the three young daughters of Carroll&#x27;s friend Henry Liddell: Lorina Charlotte (aged 13; &quot;Prima&quot; in the book&#x27;s prefatory verse); Alice Pleasance (aged 10; &quot;Secunda&quot; in the verse); and Edith Mary (aged 8; &quot;Tertia&quot; in the verse).
The journey began at Folly Bridge, Oxford, and ended upstream at Godstow, Oxfordshire. During the trip, Carroll told the girls a story that he described in his diary as &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures Under Ground&quot;, which his journal says he &quot;undertook to write out for Alice&quot;. Alice Liddell recalled that she asked Carroll to write it down: unlike other stories he had told her, this one she wanted to preserve. She finally received the manuscript more than two years later.

4 July was known as the &quot;golden afternoon&quot;, prefaced in the novel as a poem. In fact, the weather around Oxford on 4 July was &quot;cool and rather wet&quot;, although at least one scholar has disputed this claim. Scholars debate whether Carroll in fact came up with &quot;Alice&quot; during the &quot;golden afternoon&quot; or whether the story was developed over a longer period. 

Carroll had known the Liddell children since around March 1856, when he befriended Harry Liddell. He had met Lorina by early March as well. In June 1856, he took the children out on the river. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, who wrote a literary biography of Carroll, suggests that Carroll favoured Alice Pleasance Liddell in particular because her name was ripe for allusion. &quot;Pleasance&quot; means pleasure and the name &quot;Alice&quot; appeared in contemporary works, including the poem &quot;Alice Gray&quot; by William Mee, of which Carroll wrote a parody; Alice is a character in &quot;Dream-Children: A Reverie&quot;, a prose piece by Charles Lamb. Carroll, an amateur photographer by the late 1850s, produced many photographic portraits of the Liddell children – and especially of Alice, of which 20 survive.

===Manuscript: &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures Under Ground&quot;===

Carroll began writing the manuscript of the story the next day, although that earliest version is lost. The girls and Carroll took another boat trip a month later, when he elaborated the plot of the story to Alice, and in November, he began working on the manuscript in earnest. To add the finishing touches, he researched natural history in connection with the animals presented in the book and then had the book examined by other children—particularly those of George MacDonald. Though Carroll did add his own illustrations to the original copy, on publication he was advised to find a professional illustrator so that the pictures were more appealing to his audience. He subsequently approached John Tenniel to reinterpret his visions through his own artistic eye, telling him that the story had been well-liked by the children.

Carroll began planning a print edition of the &quot;Alice&quot; story in 1863. He wrote on 9 May 1863 that MacDonald&#x27;s family had suggested he publish &quot;Alice&quot;. A diary entry for 2 July says that he received a specimen page of the print edition around that date. On 26 November 1864, Carroll gave Alice the manuscript of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures Under Ground&quot;, with illustrations by Carroll, dedicating it as &quot;A Christmas Gift to a Dear Child in Memory of a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;. The published version of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; is about twice the length of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures Under Ground&quot; and includes episodes, such as the Mad Hatter&#x27;s Tea-Party (or Mad Tea Party), that do not appear in the manuscript. The only known manuscript copy of &quot;Under Ground&quot; is held in the British Library. Macmillan published a facsimile of the manuscript in 1886.

==Plot==

Alice, a young girl, sits bored by a riverbank and spots a White Rabbit with a pocket watch and waistcoat lamenting that he is late. Surprised, Alice follows him down a rabbit hole, which sends her into a lengthy plummet but to a safe landing. Inside a room with a table, she finds a key to a tiny door, beyond which is a garden. While pondering how to fit through the door, she discovers a bottle labelled &quot;Drink me&quot;. Alice drinks some of the bottle&#x27;s contents, and to her astonishment, she shrinks small enough to enter the door. However, she had left the key upon the table and cannot reach it. Alice then discovers and eats a cake labelled &quot;Eat me&quot;, which causes her to grow to a tremendous size. Unhappy, Alice bursts into tears, and the passing White Rabbit flees in a panic, dropping a fan and two gloves. Alice uses the fan for herself, which causes her to shrink once more and leaves her swimming in a pool of her own tears. Within the pool, Alice meets various animals and birds, who convene on a bank and engage in a &quot;Caucus Race&quot; to dry themselves. Following the end of the race, Alice inadvertently frightens the animals away by discussing her cat.
The White Rabbit appears looking for the gloves and fan. Mistaking Alice for his maidservant, he orders her to go to his house and retrieve them. Alice finds another bottle and drinks from it, which causes her to grow to such an extent that she gets stuck in the house. Attempting to extract her, the White Rabbit and his neighbours eventually take to hurling pebbles that turn into small cakes. Alice eats one and shrinks herself, allowing her to flee into the forest. She meets a Caterpillar seated on a mushroom and smoking a hookah. During the Caterpillar&#x27;s questioning, Alice begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by her inability to remember a poem. Before crawling away, the Caterpillar says that a bite of one side of the mushroom will make her larger, while a bite from the other side will make her smaller. During a period of trial and error, Alice&#x27;s neck extends between the treetops, frightening a pigeon who mistakes her for a serpent. After shrinking to an appropriate height, Alice arrives at the home of a Duchess, who owns a perpetually grinning Cheshire Cat. The Duchess&#x27;s baby, whom she hands to Alice, transforms into a piglet, which Alice releases into the woods. The Cheshire Cat appears to Alice and directs her toward the Hatter and March Hare before disappearing, leaving his grin behind. Alice finds the Hatter, March Hare, and a sleepy Dormouse in the midst of a tea party. The Hatter explains that it is always 6 p.m. (tea time), claiming that time is standing still as punishment for the Hatter trying to &quot;kill it&quot;. A conversation ensues around the table, and the riddle &quot;Why is a raven like a writing desk?&quot; is brought up. Alice impatiently decides to leave, calling the party stupid.
Noticing a door on a tree, Alice passes through and finds herself back in the room from the beginning of her journey. She takes the key and uses it to open the door to the garden, which turns out to be the croquet court of the Queen of Hearts, whose guard consists of living playing cards. Alice participates in a croquet game, in which hedgehogs are used as balls, flamingos are used as mallets, and soldiers act as hoops. The Queen is short-tempered and constantly orders beheadings. When the Cheshire Cat appears as only a head, the Queen orders his beheading, only to be told that such an act is impossible. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, Alice prompts the Queen to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter. When the Duchess ruminates on finding morals in everything around her, the Queen dismisses her on the threat of execution.

Alice then meets a Gryphon and a Mock Turtle, who dance to the Lobster Quadrille while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) a poem. The Mock Turtle sings them &quot;Beautiful Soup&quot;, during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for a trial, in which the Knave of Hearts stands accused of stealing the Queen&#x27;s tarts. The trial is conducted by the King of Hearts, and the jury is composed of animals that Alice previously met. Alice gradually grows in size and confidence, allowing herself increasingly frequent remarks on the irrationality of the proceedings. The Queen eventually commands Alice&#x27;s beheading, but Alice scoffs that the Queen&#x27;s guard is only a pack of cards. Although Alice holds her own for a time, the guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice&#x27;s sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be leaves from Alice&#x27;s face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.

The members of the boating party that first heard Carroll&#x27;s tale show up in chapter 3 (&quot;A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale&quot;). Alice Liddell is there, while Carroll is caricatured as the Dodo (Lewis Carroll was a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson; because he stuttered when he spoke, he sometimes pronounced his last name as &quot;Dodo-Dodgson&quot;). The Duck refers to Robinson Duckworth, and the Lory and Eaglet to Alice Liddell&#x27;s sisters Lorina and Edith.

Bill the Lizard may be a play on the name of British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. One of Tenniel&#x27;s illustrations in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;— the 1871 sequel to &quot;Alice&quot;— depicts the character referred to as the &quot;Man in White Paper&quot; (whom Alice meets on a train) as a caricature of Disraeli, wearing a paper hat. The illustrations of the Lion and the Unicorn (also in &quot;Looking-Glass&quot;) look like Tenniel&#x27;s &quot;Punch&quot; illustrations of William Ewart Gladstone and Disraeli, although Gardner says there is &quot;no proof&quot; that they were intended to represent these politicians.

Gardner has suggested that the Hatter is a reference to Theophilus Carter, an Oxford furniture dealer, and that Tenniel apparently drew the Hatter to resemble Carter, on a suggestion of Carroll&#x27;s. The Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie. These are the Liddell sisters: Elsie is L.C. (Lorina Charlotte); Tillie is Edith (her family nickname is Matilda); and Lacie is an anagram of Alice.

The Mock Turtle speaks of a drawling-master, &quot;an old conger eel&quot;, who came once a week to teach &quot;Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils&quot;. This is a reference to the art critic John Ruskin, who came once a week to the Liddell house to teach the children to draw, sketch, and paint in oils. The Mock Turtle sings &quot;Turtle Soup&quot;, which is a parody of a song called &quot;Star of the Evening, Beautiful Star&quot;, which the Liddells sang for Carroll.

== Poems and songs ==
Carroll wrote multiple poems and songs for &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, including:
*&quot;&quot;—the prefatory verse to the book, an original poem by Carroll that recalls the rowing expedition on which he first told the story of Alice&#x27;s adventures underground
*&quot;How Doth the Little Crocodile&quot;—a parody of Isaac Watts&#x27;s nursery rhyme, &quot;&quot;
*&quot;The Mouse&#x27;s Tale&quot;—an example of concrete poetry
*&quot;You Are Old, Father William&quot;—a parody of Robert Southey&#x27;s &quot;&quot;
*The Duchess&#x27;s lullaby, &quot;Speak roughly to your little boy...&quot;—a parody of David Bates&#x27; &quot;Speak Gently&quot;
*&quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat&quot;—a parody of Jane Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot;
*&quot;The Lobster Quadrille&quot;—a parody of Mary Botham Howitt&#x27;s &quot;&quot;
*&quot;&#x27;Tis the Voice of the Lobster&quot;—a parody of Isaac Watts&#x27;s &quot;&quot;
*&quot;Beautiful Soup&quot;—a parody of James M. Sayles&#x27;s &quot;Star of the Evening, Beautiful Star&quot;
*&quot;The Queen of Hearts&quot;—an actual nursery rhyme
*&quot;They told me you had been to her...&quot;—White Rabbit&#x27;s evidence

== Writing style and themes ==

=== Symbolism ===

Carroll&#x27;s biographer Morton N. Cohen reads &quot;Alice&quot; as a &quot;roman à clef&quot; populated with real figures from Carroll&#x27;s life. Alice is based on Alice Liddell; the Dodo is Carroll; Wonderland is Oxford; even the Mad Hatter&#x27;s Tea Party, according to Cohen, is a send-up of Alice&#x27;s own birthday party. The critic Jan Susina rejects Cohen&#x27;s account, arguing that Alice the character bears a tenuous relationship with Alice Liddell.

Beyond its refashioning of Carroll&#x27;s everyday life, Cohen argues, &quot;Alice&quot; critiques Victorian ideals of childhood. It is an account of &quot;the child&#x27;s plight in Victorian upper-class society&quot;, in which Alice&#x27;s mistreatment by the creatures of Wonderland reflects Carroll&#x27;s own mistreatment by older people as a child.

In the eighth chapter, three cards are painting the roses on a rose tree red, because they had accidentally planted a white-rose tree that the Queen of Hearts hates. According to Wilfrid Scott-Giles, the rose motif in &quot;Alice&quot; alludes to the English Wars of the Roses: red roses symbolised the House of Lancaster, and white roses the rival House of York.

=== Language ===
&quot;Alice&quot; is full of linguistic play, puns, and parodies. According to Gillian Beer, Carroll&#x27;s play with language evokes the feeling of words for new readers: they &quot;still have insecure edges and a nimbus of nonsense blurs the sharp focus of terms&quot;. The literary scholar Jessica Straley, in a work about the role of evolutionary theory in Victorian children&#x27;s literature, argues that Carroll&#x27;s focus on language prioritises humanism over scientism by emphasising language&#x27;s role in human self-conception.

Pat&#x27;s &quot;Digging for apples&quot; is a cross-language pun, as &quot;pomme de terre&quot; (literally; &quot;apple of the earth&quot;) means potato and &quot;pomme&quot; means apple. In the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as &quot;O Mouse&quot;, based on her memory of the noun declensions &quot;in her brother&#x27;s Latin Grammar, &#x27;A mouse – of a mouse – to a mouse – a mouse – O mouse! These words correspond to the first five of Latin&#x27;s six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: &quot;mus&quot; (nominative), &quot;muris&quot; (genitive), &quot;muri&quot; (dative), &quot;murem&quot; (accusative), &quot;(O) mus&quot; (vocative). The sixth case, &quot;mure&quot; (ablative) is absent from Alice&#x27;s recitation. Nilson suggests that Alice&#x27;s missing ablative is a pun on her father Henry Liddell&#x27;s work on the standard &quot;A Greek-English Lexicon&quot;, since ancient Greek does not have an ablative case. Further, mousa (μούσα, meaning muse) was a standard model noun in Greek textbooks of the time in paradigms of the first declension, short-alpha noun.

=== Mathematics ===
Mathematics and logic are central to &quot;Alice&quot;. As Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserts in the &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine that Carroll wrote &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; in its final form as a satire on mid-19th century mathematics.

=== Eating and devouring ===
Carina Garland notes how the world is &quot;expressed via representations of food and appetite&quot;, naming Alice&#x27;s frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her &#x27;Curious Appetites&#x27;. Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images. After the riddle &quot;Why is a raven like a writing-desk?&quot;, the Hatter claims that Alice might as well say, &quot;I see what I eat…I eat what I see&quot; and so the riddle&#x27;s solution, put forward by Boe Birns, could be that &quot;A raven eats worms; a writing desk is worm-eaten&quot;; this idea of food encapsulates idea of life feeding on life itself, for the worm is being eaten and then becomes the eater—a horrific image of mortality.

Nina Auerbach discusses how the novel revolves around eating and drinking which &quot;motivates much of her [Alice&#x27;s] behaviour&quot;, for the story is essentially about things &quot;entering and leaving her mouth.&quot; The animals of Wonderland are of particular interest, for Alice&#x27;s relation to them shifts constantly because, as Lovell-Smith states, Alice&#x27;s changes in size continually reposition her in the food chain, serving as a way to make her acutely aware of the &#x27;eat or be eaten&#x27; attitude that permeates Wonderland.

=== Nonsense ===
&quot;Alice&quot; is an example of the literary nonsense genre. According to Humphrey Carpenter, &quot;Alice&quot; brand of nonsense embraces the nihilistic and existential. Characters in nonsensical episodes such as the Mad Hatter&#x27;s Tea Party, in which it is always the same time, go on posing paradoxes that are never resolved.

=== Rules and games ===
Wonderland is a rule-bound world, but its rules are not those of our world. The literary scholar Daniel Bivona writes that &quot;Alice&quot; is characterised by &quot;gamelike social structures.&quot; She trusts in instructions from the beginning, drinking from the bottle labelled &quot;drink me&quot; after recalling, during her descent, that children who do not follow the rules often meet terrible fates. Unlike the creatures of Wonderland, who approach their world&#x27;s wonders uncritically, Alice continues to look for rules as the story progresses. Gillian Beer suggests that Alice looks for rules to soothe her anxiety, while Carroll may have hunted for rules because he struggled with the implications of the non-Euclidean geometry then in development.

== Illustrations ==
The manuscript was illustrated by Carroll, who added 37 illustrations—printed in a facsimile edition in 1887. John Tenniel provided 42 wood-engraved illustrations for the published version of the book. The first print run was destroyed (or sold in the US) at Carroll&#x27;s request because Tenniel was dissatisfied with the printing quality. There are only 22 known first edition copies in existence. The book was reprinted and published in 1866. Tenniel&#x27;s detailed black-and-white drawings remain the definitive depiction of the characters.

Tenniel&#x27;s illustrations of Alice do not portray the real Alice Liddell, who had dark hair and a short fringe. &quot;Alice&quot; has provided a challenge for other illustrators, including those of 1907 by Charles Pears and the full series of colour plates and line-drawings by Harry Rountree published in the (inter-War) Children&#x27;s Press (Glasgow) edition. Other significant illustrators include: Arthur Rackham (1907), Willy Pogany (1929), Mervyn Peake (1946), Ralph Steadman (1967), Salvador Dalí (1969), Graham Overden (1969), Max Ernst (1970), Peter Blake (1970), Tove Jansson (1977), Anthony Browne (1988), Helen Oxenbury (1999), and Lisbeth Zwerger (1999).

== Publication history ==
Carroll first met Alexander Macmillan, a high-powered London publisher, on 19 October 1863. His firm, Macmillan Publishers, agreed to publish &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; by sometime in 1864. Carroll financed the initial print run, possibly because it gave him more editorial authority than other financing methods. He managed publication details such as typesetting and engaged illustrators and translators.

Macmillan had published &quot;The Water-Babies&quot;, also a children&#x27;s fantasy, in 1863, and suggested its design as a basis for &quot;Alice&quot;. Carroll saw a specimen copy in May 1865. 2,000 copies were printed by July, but Tenniel objected to their quality, and Carroll instructed Macmillan to halt publication so they could be reprinted. In August, he engaged Richard Clay as an alternative printer for a new run of 2,000. The reprint cost £600, paid entirely by Carroll. He received the first copy of Clay&#x27;s edition on 9 November 1865.
Macmillan finally published the new edition, printed by Richard Clay, in November 1865. Carroll requested a red binding, deeming it appealing to young readers. A new edition, released in December 1865 for the Christmas market but carrying an 1866 date, was quickly printed. The text blocks of the original edition were removed from the binding and sold with Carroll&#x27;s permission to the New York publishing house of D. Appleton &amp; Company. The binding for the Appleton &quot;Alice&quot; was identical to the 1866 Macmillan &quot;Alice&quot;, except for the publisher&#x27;s name at the foot of the spine. The title page of the Appleton &quot;Alice&quot; was an insert cancelling the original Macmillan title page of 1865 and bearing the New York publisher&#x27;s imprint and the date 1866.

The entire print run sold out quickly. &quot;Alice&quot; was a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike. Oscar Wilde was a fan; Queen Victoria was also an avid reader of the book. She reportedly enjoyed &quot;Alice&quot; enough that she asked for Carroll&#x27;s next book, which turned out to be a mathematical treatise; Carroll denied this. The book has never been out of print. &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; has been translated into 174 languages.

== Reception ==

&quot;Alice&quot; was published to critical praise. One magazine declared it &quot;exquisitely wild, fantastic, [and] impossible&quot;. In the late 19th century, Walter Besant wrote that &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; &quot;was a book of that extremely rare kind which will belong to all the generations to come until the language becomes obsolete&quot;.

F. J. Harvey Darton argued in a 1932 book that &quot;Alice&quot; ended an era of didacticism in children&#x27;s literature, inaugurating a new era in which writing for children aimed to &quot;delight or entertain&quot;. In 2014, Robert McCrum named &quot;Alice&quot; &quot;one of the best loved in the English canon&quot; and called it &quot;perhaps the greatest, possibly most influential, and certainly the most world-famous Victorian English fiction&quot;. A 2020 review in &quot;Time&quot; states: &quot;The book changed young people&#x27;s literature. It helped to replace stiff Victorian didacticism with a looser, sillier, nonsense style that reverberated through the works of language-loving 20th-century authors as different as James Joyce, Douglas Adams and Dr. Seuss.&quot; The protagonist of the story, Alice, has been recognised as a cultural icon. In 2006, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; was named among the icons of England in a public vote.

== Adaptations and influence ==


Books for children in the &quot;Alice&quot; mould emerged as early as 1869 and continued to appear throughout the late 19th century. Released in 1903, the British silent film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; was the first screen adaptation of the book.

In 2015, Robert Douglas-Fairhurst wrote in the &quot;Guardian&quot;,

Labelled &quot;a dauntless, no-nonsense heroine&quot; by the &quot;Guardian&quot;, the character of the plucky, yet proper, Alice has proven immensely popular and inspired similar heroines in literature and pop culture, many also named Alice in homage. The book has inspired numerous film and television adaptations, which have multiplied, as the original work is now in the public domain in all jurisdictions. Musical works inspired by &quot;Alice&quot; include the Beatles&#x27;s song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, with songwriter John Lennon attributing the song&#x27;s fantastical imagery to his reading of Carroll&#x27;s books. A popular figure in Japan since the country opened up to the West in the late 19th century, Alice has been a popular subject for writers of manga and a source of inspiration for Japanese fashion, in particular Lolita fashion.

=== Live performance ===

The first full major production was &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, a musical play in London&#x27;s West End by Henry Savile Clarke and Walter Slaughter, which premiered at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1886. Twelve-year-old actress Phoebe Carlo (the first to play Alice) was personally selected by Carroll for the role. Carroll attended a performance on 30 December 1886, writing in his diary that he enjoyed it. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the Globe Theatre in 1888, with Isa Bowman as Alice.

As the book and its sequel are Carroll&#x27;s most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English pantomimes. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. Eva Le Gallienne&#x27;s stage adaptation of the &quot;Alice&quot; books premiered on 12 December 1932 and ended its run in May 1933. The production was revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. A community theatre production of &quot;Alice&quot; was Olivia de Havilland&#x27;s first foray onto the stage.

A dramatisation by Herbert M. Prentice premiered at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon in 1947, and was in turn adapted for television by John Glyn-Jones and shown by the BBC on Christmas Day 1948. The BBC screened another adaptation of Prentice&#x27;s play in 1956.

Joseph Papp staged &quot;Alice in Concert&quot; at the Public Theater in New York City in 1980. Elizabeth Swados wrote the book, lyrics, and music based on both &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the New York Shakespeare Festival. Meryl Streep played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included Debbie Allen, Michael Jeter, and Mark Linn-Baker. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. 
The 1992 musical theatre production &quot;Alice&quot; used both books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Carroll, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan writing the music. Although the original production in Hamburg, Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album &quot;Alice&quot; in 2002.

The English composer Joseph Horovitz composed an &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; ballet commissioned by the London Festival Ballet in 1953. It was performed frequently in England and the US. A ballet by Christopher Wheeldon and Nicholas Wright commissioned for the Royal Ballet entitled &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; premiered in February 2011 at the Royal Opera House in London. The ballet was based on the novel Wheeldon grew up reading as a child and is generally faithful to the original story, although some critics claimed it may have been too faithful. 

Unsuk Chin&#x27;s opera &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; premiered in 2007 at the Bavarian State Opera and was hailed as World Premiere of the Year by the German opera magazine &quot;Opernwelt&quot;. Gerald Barry&#x27;s 2016 one-act opera, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures Under Ground&quot;, first staged in 2020 at the Royal Opera House, is a conflation of the two &quot;Alice&quot; books. In 2022, the Opéra national du Rhin performed the ballet &quot;Alice&quot;, with a score by Philip Glass, in Mulhouse, France.

==Commemoration==

Characters from the book are depicted in the stained glass windows of Carroll&#x27;s hometown church, All Saints&#x27;, in Daresbury, Cheshire, England. Another commemoration of Carroll&#x27;s work in his home county of Cheshire is the granite sculpture &quot;The Mad Hatter&#x27;s Tea Party&quot;, located in Warrington. International works based on the book include the Alice in Wonderland statue in Central Park, New York, and the Alice statue in Rymill Park, Adelaide, Australia. 

In 2015, &quot;Alice&quot; characters were featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of the book. In 2021, the Royal Mint issued their first &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; commemorative coin collection, including a £5 coin featuring Alice and the Cheshire Cat (inspired by Tenniel&#x27;s original illustration).

<text>A pseudopod or pseudopodium (: pseudopods or pseudopodia) is a temporary arm-like projection of a eukaryotic cell membrane that is emerged in the direction of movement. Filled with cytoplasm, pseudopodia primarily consist of actin filaments and may also contain microtubules and intermediate filaments. Pseudopods are used for motility and ingestion. They are often found in amoebas.

Different types of pseudopodia can be classified by their distinct appearances. Lamellipodia are broad and thin. Filopodia are slender, thread-like, and are supported largely by microfilaments. Lobopodia are bulbous and amoebic. Reticulopodia are complex structures bearing individual pseudopodia which form irregular nets. Axopodia are the phagocytosis type with long, thin pseudopods supported by complex microtubule arrays enveloped with cytoplasm; they respond rapidly to physical contact.

Generally, several pseudopodia arise from the surface of the body, (&quot;polypodial&quot;, for example, &quot;Amoeba proteus&quot;), or a single pseudopod may form on the surface of the body (&quot;monopodial&quot;, such as &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;).

==Formation==
Cells which make pseudopods are generally referred to as &quot;amoeboids&quot;.

===Via extracellular cue===
To move towards a target, the cell uses chemotaxis. It senses extracellular signalling molecules, chemoattractants (e.g. cAMP for &quot;Dictyostelium&quot; cells), to extend pseudopodia at the membrane area facing the source of these molecules.

The chemoattractants bind to G protein-coupled receptors, which activate GTPases of the Rho family (e.g. Cdc42, Rac) via G proteins.

Rho GTPases are able to activate WASp which in turn activate Arp2/3 complex which serve as nucleation sites for actin polymerization. The actin polymers then push the membrane as they grow, forming the pseudopod. The pseudopodium can then adhere to a surface via its adhesion proteins (e.g. integrins), and then pull the cell&#x27;s body forward via contraction of an actin-myosin complex in the pseudopod. This type of locomotion is called &quot;amoeboid movement&quot;.

Rho GTPases can also activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) which recruit PIP3 to the membrane at the leading edge and detach the PIP3-degrading enzyme PTEN from the same area of the membrane. PIP3 then activate GTPases back via GEF stimulation. This serves as a feedback loop to amplify and maintain the presence of local GTPase at the leading edge.

Otherwise, pseudopodia cannot grow on other sides of the membrane than the leading edge because myosin filaments prevent them to extend. These myosin filaments are induced by cyclic GMP in &quot;D. discoideum&quot; or Rho kinase in neutrophils for example.

Different physical parameters were shown to regulate the length and time-scale of pseudopodia formation. For example, an increase in membrane tension inhibits actin assembly and protrusion formation. It was demonstrated that the lowered negative surface charge on the inner surface of the plasma membrane generates protrusions via activation of the Ras-PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.

===Without extracellular cue===
In the case there is no extracellular cue, all moving cells navigate in random directions, but they can keep the same direction for some time before turning. This feature allows cells to explore large areas for colonization or searching for a new extracellular cue.

In &quot;Dictyostelium&quot; cells, a pseudopodium can form either &quot;de novo&quot; as normal, or from an existing pseudopod, forming a Y-shaped pseudopodium.

The Y-shaped pseudopods are used by &quot;Dictyostelium&quot; to advance relatively straight forward by alternating between retraction of the left or right branch of the pseudopod. The &quot;de novo&quot; pseudopodia form at different sides than pre-existing ones, they are used by the cells to turn.

Y-shaped pseudopods are more frequent than &quot;de novo&quot; ones, which explain the preference of the cell to keep moving to the same direction. This persistence is modulated by PLA2 and cGMP signalling pathways.

==Functions==
The functions of pseudopodia include locomotion and ingestion:
* Pseudopodia are critical in sensing targets which can then be engulfed; the engulfing pseudopodia are called phagocytosis pseudopodia. A common example of this type of amoeboid cell is the macrophage. 
* They are also essential to amoeboid-like locomotion. Human mesenchymal stem cells are a good example of this function: these migratory cells are responsible for in-utero remodeling; for example, in the formation of the trilaminar germ disc during gastrulation.

==Morphology==
Pseudopods can be classified into several varieties according to the number of projections (monopodia and polypodia), and according to their appearance.

Some pseudopodial cells are able to use multiple types of pseudopodia depending on the situation. Most use a combination of lamellipodia and filopodia to migrate (e.g. metastatic cancer cells). Human foreskin fibroblasts can either use lamellipodia- or lobopodia-based migration in a 3D matrix depending on the matrix elasticity.

===Lamellipodia===
Lamellipodia are broad and flat pseudopodia used in locomotion. They are supported by microfilaments which form at the leading edge, creating a mesh-like internal network.

===Filopodia===
Filopodia (or filose pseudopods) are slender and filiform with pointed ends, consisting mainly of ectoplasm. These formations are supported by microfilaments which, unlike the filaments of lamellipodia with their net-like actin, form loose bundles by cross-linking. This formation is partly due to bundling proteins such as fimbrins and fascins.
Filopodia are observed in some animal cells: in part of Filosa (Rhizaria), in &quot;Testaceafilosia&quot;, in Vampyrellidae and Pseudosporida (Rhizaria) and in Nucleariida (Opisthokonta).

===Lobopodia===
Lobopodia (or lobose pseudopods) are bulbous, short, and blunt in form. These finger-like, tubular pseudopodia contain both ectoplasm and endoplasm. They can be found in different kind of cells, notably in Lobosa and other Amoebozoa and in some Heterolobosea (Excavata).

High-pressure lobopodia can also be found in human fibroblasts travelling through a complex network of 3D matrix (e.g. mammalian dermis, cell-derived matrix). Contrarily to other pseudopodia using the pressure exerted by actin polymerization on the membrane to extend, fibroblast lobopods use the nuclear piston mechanism consisting in pulling the nucleus via actomyosin contractility to push the cytoplasm that in turn push the membrane, leading to pseudopod formation. To occur, this lobopodia-based fibroblast migration needs nesprin 3, integrins, RhoA, ROCK and myosin II.
Otherwise, lobopods are often accompanied with small lateral blebs forming along the side of the cell, probably due to the high intracellular pressure during lobopodia formation increasing the frequency of plasma membrane-cortex rupture.

===Reticulopodia===
Reticulopodia (or reticulose pseudopods), are complex formations in which individual pseudopods are merged and form irregular nets. The primary function of reticulopodia, also known as myxopodia, is food ingestion, with locomotion a secondary function. Reticulopods are typical of Foraminifera, Chlorarachnea, &quot;Gromia&quot; and &quot;Filoreta&quot; (Rhizaria).

===Axopodia===
Axopodia (also known as actinopodia) are narrow pseudopodia containing complex arrays of microtubules enveloped by cytoplasm. Axopodia are mostly responsible for phagocytosis by rapidly retracting in response to physical contact. These pseudopodia are primarily food-collecting structures, but also provide a means of hydrological transportation via the expansion of their surface areas. They are observed in &quot;Radiolaria&quot; and &quot;Heliozoa&quot;.

<doc id="52863" wikidata="Q773108" url="?curid=52863" title="Seasoning">
<text>Seasoning is the process of supplementing food via herbs, spices, and/or salts, intended to enhance a particular flavour.

==General meaning==
Seasonings include herbs and spices, which are themselves frequently referred to as &quot;seasonings&quot;. However, &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot; states that &quot;to season and to flavor are not the same thing&quot;, insisting that seasoning includes a large or small amount of salt being added to a preparation. Salt may be used to draw out water, or to magnify a natural flavor of a food making it richer or more delicate, depending on the dish. This type of procedure is akin to curing. For instance, sea salt (a coarser-grained salt) is rubbed into chicken, lamb, and beef to tenderize the meat and improve flavour. Other seasonings like black pepper and basil transfer some of their flavors to the food. A well-designed dish may combine seasonings that complement each other.

In addition to the choice of herbs and seasoning, the timing of when flavors are added will affect the food that is being cooked or otherwise prepared. Seasonings are usually added near the end of the cooking period, or even at the table, when the food is served. The most common table-seasonings are salt, pepper, and acids (such as lemon juice). When seasonings are used properly, they cannot be tasted; their job is to heighten the flavors of the original ingredients.

Researchers have found traces of garlic mustard seeds in prehistoric pots that also contained traces of meat, making this the earliest recording of seasoning food.

==Oil infusion==
Infused oils are also used for seasoning. There are two methods for doing an infusion—hot and cold. Olive oil makes a good infusion base for some herbs, but tends to go rancid more quickly than other oils. Infused oils should be kept refrigerated.

==Escoffier==
In &quot;Le Guide Culinaire&quot;, Auguste Escoffier divides seasoning and condiments into the following groups:

===Seasonings===

# &quot;Saline seasonings&quot; – salt, spiced salt, saltpeter.
# &quot;Acid seasonings&quot; – plain vinegar (sodium acetate), or same aromatized with tarragon; &quot;verjuice&quot;, lemon and orange juices.
# &quot;Hot seasonings&quot; – peppercorns, ground or coarsely chopped pepper, or &quot;mignonette pepper&quot;; paprika, curry, cayenne, and mixed pepper spices.
# &quot;Spice seasonings&quot; – made by using essential oils like paprika, clove oil, etc.

===Condiments===

# &quot;The pungents&quot; – onions, shallots, garlic, chives, and horseradish.
# &quot;Hot condiments&quot; – mustard, gherkins, capers, English sauces, such as Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, etc. and American sauces such as chili sauce, Tabasco, A1 Steak Sauce, etc.; the wines used in reductions and braisings; the finishing elements of sauces and soups.
# &quot;Fatty substances&quot; – most animal fats, butter, vegetable greases (edible oils and margarine).

== Non-culinary uses ==
Seasonings have also been used for non-culinary purposes throughout history. Cinnamon, for example, was widely utilized in the production of Kyphi, a perfume used in ancient Egypt. Other herbs and spices have also been used in a variety of historical medicinal treatments, such as those described in Ebers Papyrus.

<doc id="52864" wikidata="Q725668" url="?curid=52864" title="Marination">
<text>Marinating is the process of soaking foods in a seasoned, often acidic, liquid before cooking. This liquid, called the marinade, can be either acidic (made with ingredients such as vinegar, lemon juice, or wine) or enzymatic (made with ingredients such as pineapple, papaya, yogurt, or ginger), or have a neutral pH. In addition to these ingredients, a marinade often contains oils, herbs, and spices to further flavor the food items.

It is commonly used to flavor foods and to tenderize tougher cuts of meat. The process may last seconds or days. Marinades vary between different cuisines.

Marinating is similar to brining, except that brining relies on the action of salty brine rather than the action of acids or enzymes. Marinating is also similar to pickling, except that pickling is generally done for much longer periods of months or even years, primarily as a means of food preservation. Conversely, marinating is usually performed for a few hours to a day, generally as a means of enhancing the flavor of the food or tenderizing it.

The French word derives from the verb &quot;to pickle in sea brine&quot;, and ultimately from the Latin noun &quot;sea&quot;, suggesting that marinades may have evolved from an ancient brining tradition or may have initially used sea brine as an ingredient.

==Tissue breakdown==

In meats, the acid causes the tissue to break down, which allows more moisture to be absorbed and results in a juicier end product; however, too much acid can be detrimental to the end product. A good marinade has a balance of acid, oil, and spice. If raw marinated meat is frozen, the marinade can break down the surface and turn the outer layer mushy.

Often confused with marinating, macerating is a similar form of food preparation.

==Safety considerations==

Raw pork, seafood, beef and poultry may contain harmful bacteria which may contaminate the marinade. Marinating should be done in the refrigerator to inhibit bacterial growth. Used marinade should not be made into a sauce unless rendered safe by boiling directly before use; otherwise, fresh or set-aside marinade that has not touched meat should be used. The container used for marinating should be glass or food safe plastic. Metal, including pottery glazes which can contain lead, reacts with the acid in the marinade and should be avoided.

<doc id="52865" wikidata="Q911646" url="?curid=52865" title="Brining">
<text>In food processing, brining is treating food with brine or coarse salt which preserves and seasons the food while enhancing tenderness and flavor with additions such as herbs, spices, sugar, caramel or vinegar. Meat and fish are typically brined for less than twenty-four hours while vegetables, cheeses and fruit are brined in a much longer process known as pickling. Brining is similar to marination, except that a marinade usually includes a significant amount of acid, such as vinegar or citrus juice. Brining is also similar to curing, which usually involves significantly drying the food, and is done over a much longer time period.

==Meat==
Brining is typically a process in which meat is soaked in a salt water solution similar to marination before cooking. Meat is soaked anywhere from 30 minutes to several days. The brine may be seasoned with spices and herbs. The amount of time needed to brine depends on the size of the meat: more time is needed for a large turkey compared to a broiler fryer chicken. Similarly, a large roast must be brined longer than a thin cut of meat.

===Dry brining===

Brining can also be achieved by covering the meat in dry coarse salt and left to rest for several hours. The salt draws moisture from the interior of the meat to the surface, where it mixes with the salt and is then reabsorbed with the salt essentially brining the meat in its own juices. The salt rub is then rinsed off and discarded before cooking.

Food scientists have two theories about the brining effect, but which one is correct is still under debate.
*The brine surrounding the cells has a higher concentration of salt than the fluid within the cells, but the cell fluid has a higher concentration of other solutes. This leads salt ions to diffuse into the cell, while the solutes in the cells cannot diffuse through the cell membranes into the brine. The increased salinity of the cell fluid causes the cell to absorb water from the brine via osmosis.
*The salt introduced into the cell denatures its proteins. The proteins coagulate, forming a matrix that traps water molecules and holds them during cooking. This prevents the meat from dehydrating.

==Fish==

As opposed to dry salting, fish brining or wet-salting is performed by immersion of fish into brine, or just sprinkling it with salt without draining the moisture. To ensure long-term preservation, the solution has to contain at least 20% of salt, a process called &quot;heavy salting&quot; in fisheries; heavy-salted fish must be desalted in cold water or milk before consumption. If less salt is used, the fish is suited for immediate consumption, but additional refrigeration is necessary for longer preservation.

Wet-salting is used for preparation of:
* Salted herring, non-gutted, with hard or soft roe and heavily salted (20% NaCl brine, with final product containing around 12% salt), 
* Soused herring which is gutted and lightly salted (2–3% NaCl), without roe,
* Anchovies, which can be immersed in brine or wet-salted. After several years, the fish liquefies and can be processed into paste or anchovy butter,
* Caviar and other types of roe.

==Vegetables==
Pickled vegetables are immersed in brine, vinegar or vinaigrette for extended periods of time, where they undergo anaerobic fermentation which affects their texture and flavor. Pickling can preserve perishable foods for months. Antimicrobial herbs and spices, such as mustard seed, garlic, cinnamon or cloves, are often added. Unlike the canning process, pickling (which includes fermentation) does not require that the food be completely sterile before it is sealed. The acidity or salinity of the solution, the temperature of fermentation, and the exclusion of oxygen determine which microorganisms dominate, and determine the flavor of the end product.

==Cheese==
Brine is used in two ways in cheese production:

* Brined cheeses, such as halloumi and feta, are pickled in brine.
* Washed-rind cheeses, such as Munster, are washed with brine during the production process.

<text>In recipes, quantities of ingredients may be specified by mass (commonly called weight), by volume, or by count.

For most of history, most cookbooks did not specify quantities precisely, instead talking of &quot;a nice leg of spring lamb&quot;, a &quot;cupful&quot; of lentils, a piece of butter &quot;the size of a small apricot&quot;, and &quot;sufficient&quot; salt. Informal measurements such as a &quot;pinch&quot;, a &quot;drop&quot;, or a &quot;hint&quot; (&quot;soupçon&quot;) continue to be used from time to time. In the US, Fannie Farmer introduced the more exact specification of quantities by volume in her 1896 &quot;Boston Cooking-School Cook Book&quot;.

Today, most of the world prefers metric measurement by weight, though the preference for volume measurements continues among home cooks in the United States and the rest of North America. Different ingredients are measured in different ways:

Liquid ingredients are generally measured by volume worldwide.

Dry bulk ingredients, such as sugar and flour, are measured by weight in most of the world (&quot;250 g flour&quot;), and by volume in North America (&quot; cup flour&quot;). Small quantities of salt and spices are generally measured by volume worldwide, as few households have sufficiently precise balances to measure by weight.

In most countries, meat is described by weight or count: &quot;a 2 kilogram chicken&quot;; &quot;four lamb chops&quot;.

Eggs are usually specified by count. Vegetables are usually specified by weight or occasionally by count, despite the inherent imprecision of counts given the variability in the size of vegetables.

==Metric measures==
In most of the world, recipes use the metric system of units—litres (L) and millilitres (mL), grams (g) and kilograms (kg), and degrees Celsius (°C). The official spelling &quot;litre&quot; is used in most English-speaking nations; the notable exception is the United States where the spelling &quot;liter&quot; is preferred.

The United States measures weight in pounds (avoirdupois), while recipes in the UK tend to include both imperial and metric measures, following the advice of the Guild of Food Writers. The United States also uses volume measures based on cooking utensils and pre-metric measures. The actual values frequently deviate from the utensils on which they were based, and there is little consistency from one country to another.

 In South Australia, a &quot;pint&quot; of beer is traditionally 425 mL, while most other states have metricated this value to 570 mL.

‡ In Canada, a cup was historically 8 imperial fluid ounces (227 mL) but could also refer to 10 imperial fl oz (284 mL), as in Britain, and even a metric cup of 250 mL. Serving sizes on nutrition labelling on food packages in Canada employ the metric cup of 250 mL, with nutrition labelling in the US using a cup of 240 mL, based on the US customary cup.

* In the UK, teaspoons and tablespoons are formally and of an imperial pint (3·55 mL and 14·21 mL), respectively. In Canada, a teaspoon is historically imperial fluid ounce (4.74 mL) and a tablespoon is imperial fl oz (14.21 mL). In both Britain and Canada, cooking utensils commonly come in 5 mL for teaspoons and 15 mL for tablespoons, hence why it is labelled as that on the chart.

The volume measures here are for comparison only. See below for the definition of Gallon for more details.

In addition, the &quot;cook&#x27;s cup&quot; above is not the same as a &quot;coffee cup&quot;, which can vary anywhere from , or even smaller for espresso.

In Australia, since 1970, metric utensil units have been standardized by law, and imperial measures no longer have legal status. However, it is wise to measure the actual volume of the utensil measures, particularly the &#x27;Australian tablespoon&#x27; (see above), since many are imported from other countries with different values. Dessertspoons are standardized as part of the metric system at 10 mL, though they are not normally used in contemporary recipes. Australia is the only metricated country with a metric tablespoon of 20 mL, unlike other countries that metricated, which have a 15 mL metric tablespoon.

In Europe, older recipes frequently refer to &quot;pounds&quot; (e.g. in German, in Dutch, in French). In each case, the unit refers to 500 g, about 10% more than an avoirdupois pound (454 g). Dutch recipes may also use the , which is 100 g.

==Weight of liquids==
With the advent of accurate electronic scales, it has become more common to weigh liquids for use in recipes, avoiding the need for accurate volumetric utensils. The most common liquids used in cooking are water and milk, milk having approximately the same density as water.

1 mL of water weighs 1 gram so a recipe calling for 300 mL (≈ Imperial Pint) of water can simply be substituted with 300 g (≈ 10 oz.) of water.

1 fluid ounce of water weighs approximately 1 ounce so a recipe calling for a UK pint (20 fl oz) of water can be substituted with 20 oz of water.

More accurate measurements become important in the large volumes used in commercial food production. Also, a home cook can use greater precision at times. Water at may be volumetrically measured then weighed to determine an unknown measuring-utensil volume without the need for a water-density adjustment.

== United States measures ==
The US uses pounds and ounces (avoirdupois) for weight, and US customary units for volume. For measures used in cookbooks published in other nations navigate to the appropriate regional section in Traditional measurement systems.

Measures are classified as either dry measures or fluid measures. Some of the fluid and dry measures have similar names, but the actual measured volume is quite different. A recipe will generally specify which measurement is required. U.S. recipes are commonly in terms of fluid measures, even for dry ingredients. Most of these units derive from earlier English units, as applied to the U.S. gallon. Typically they follow a pattern of binary submultiples, where each larger measure consists of two units of the next-smallest measure. An exception is with the commonly used teaspoon as one-third of a tablespoon.

Binary submultiples are fractional parts obtained by successively dividing by the number 2. Thus, one-half, one-fourth, one-eighth, one-sixteenth, and so on, are binary submultiples. The system can be traced back to the measuring systems of the Hindus and the ancient Egyptians, who subdivided the (about 4.8 litres) into parts of , , , , and (1 , or mouthful, or about 14.5 ml), and the similarly down to (1 ) using hieratic notation, as early as the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt, 2494 to 2345 BC, thus making the &quot;English doubling system&quot; at least 4300 years old.

From units and tools of convenience, most of the system&#x27;s history could have values vary widely, and was not until recent centuries that standardization began to take shape. Moreso, the overlap with other systems like the apothecaries&#x27; system, and giving each division a unique and often variable by context, person, place, and time name instead of a systematic one, can make the system seem confusing for those not accustomed to it. However, other than the names themselves, the regular ratios make the actual measurements straightforward; and in many cases names have been deprecated in favor of fractionally denominated amounts of a few core units (such as taking gallons, cups, and teaspoons to their nearest quarters without names: nixing pottle; gill and wineglass; dram (as a culinary unit), coffeespoon, and saltspoon; respectively), or are limited to the specific or esoteric.

It is still a legal basis for measures in many states, such as Massachusetts, which mandates that &quot;Glass bottles or jars used for the sale of milk or cream to the consumer shall be of the capacity of one gallon, a multiple of the gallon, or a binary submultiple of the gallon.&quot;

Metric equivalents are based upon one of two nearly equivalent systems. In the standard system the conversion is that 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches and 1 inch = 2.54 cm, which makes a gallon = 3785.411784 millilitres exactly. For nutritional labeling on food packages in the US, the teaspoon is defined as exactly 5 ml, giving 1 gallon = 3840 ml exactly. This chart uses the former.

Suffixed asterisks on some of the &quot;tsp&quot; units in the &quot;Defined&quot; column above indicate that those teaspoon units are defined as fl oz (4 fl dram), the old 4 tsp = 1 tbsp amount, instead of fl oz. This definition fits with &quot;barkeepers&#x27; teaspoon&quot;, and is used in many cocktail recipe books; generally the subdivisions are not so explicitly defined nor named below tsp in general culinary. This can be verified by comparing the associated values in the &quot;fl oz&quot; column. All other &quot;tsp&quot; units in the &quot;Defined&quot; column are indeed defined as fl oz, the current 3 tsp = 1 tbsp amount.

* Discrepancies due to size, generally disregarded as at the scale it becomes a factor, the person generally is using the next size up measuring cup (i.e.: fl oz is likely to be straight measured in an ounce cup and not as 9 (vs 12) teaspoons) 
‡ Rare if not nonexistent in use by name rather than as fraction of a different unit.

† The fluid scruple has been properly defined on its own in the apothecaries&#x27; system as fl oz, fluid dram, or = 20 minims (≈ 1.23223 ml), and also tsp. Mind that scruples and drams were pharmaceutical and intended to be specific and precise, whereas cooking measures tended to use what was on hand and/or actually used to consume what was being prepared, and not intended to be as formally scientific in its degree of precision.
The saltspoon most likely combined into the scruple over time, as a consequence of home cooks approximating standard measures with what they had at hand, much as the teaspoon was roughly &quot;close enough&quot; for a kitchen approximation to a fluid dram (= 60 minims), but not equal to the fl dr (80 minims) value it actually is; especially with the variability of the &quot;method&quot; of measuring itself. Not of insignificance is the natural habit of customary measures to use a 2n dividing scheme regardless of exact definitions, and this pattern is seen even with metric measuring spoons

Confusion comes about from teaspoon continuing to be called a &quot;dram&quot; in vernacular, despite the sizes of actual spoons creeping up quietly over time, such that of a tsp (tsp &gt; fl dr) would in fact become congruent with current fl dr values for the scruple and saltspoon; in other words, the terminology not keeping pace with the definition. At the small scales involved this is negligible (i.e.: math can convert down to tsp ×10−9, but to what degree can it practically be meted); however can cause problems when accuracy is required such as medicines: &quot;In almost all cases the modern teacups, tablespoons, dessertspoons, and teaspoons, after careful test by the author, were found to average 25 percent greater capacity than the theoretical quantities given above, and thus the use of accurately graduated medicine glasses, which may be had now at a trifling cost, should be insisted upon.&quot;

* Discrepancies due to size, generally disregarded as at the scale it becomes a factor, the person generally is using the next size up measuring cup (i.e.: fl oz is likely to be straight measured in an ounce cup and not as 9 (&quot;vs 12&quot;) teaspoons)

In domestic cooking, bulk solids, notably flour and sugar, are measured by volume, often cups, though they are sold by weight at retail. Weight measures are used for meat. Butter may be measured by either weight ( lb) or volume (3 tbsp) or a combination of weight and volume ( lb plus 3 tbsp); it is sold by weight but in packages marked to facilitate common divisions by eye. (As a sub-packaged unit, a &quot;stick&quot; of butter, at lb [113 g], is a &quot;de facto&quot; measure in the US.) Some recipes may specify butter amounts called a &quot;pat&quot; (1 - 1.5 tsp) or a &quot;knob&quot; (2 tbsp).

Cookbooks in Canada use the same system, although pints and gallons would be taken as their Imperial quantities unless specified otherwise. Following the adoption of the metric system, recipes in Canada are frequently published with metric conversions.

===Approximate units===

There are a variety of approximate units of measures, which are frequently undefined by any official source, or which have had conflicting definitions over time, yet which are commonly used. The measurement units that are most commonly understood to be approximate are the drop, smidgen, pinch, and dash, yet nearly all of the traditional cooking measurement units lack statutory definitions, or even any definition by any organization authorized to set standards in the U.S. For example, of the table above, only the fluid ounce, pint, quart, and gallon are officially defined by the NIST. All of the others appear only in conversion guides lacking statutory authority, or in now-obsolete publications of the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, or USP—essentially, the Apothecaries&#x27; system—which still has authority to define certain drug and supplement standards. The USP has long-since abandoned Apothecaries&#x27; measurements, and even now recommends against using teaspoons to measure doses of medicine.

== British (Imperial) measures ==
Note that measurements in this section are in imperial units.

British imperial measures distinguish between weight and volume.

Weight is measured in ounces and pounds (avoirdupois) as in the U.S.

Volume is measured in imperial gallons, quarts, pints, fluid ounces, fluid drachms, and minims. The imperial gallon was originally defined as of water in 1824, and refined as exactly 4.54609 litres in 1985.

Traditionally, when describing volumes, recipes commonly give measurements in the following units:
* Tumbler (10 fluid ounces; named after a typical drinking glass)
* Breakfast cup (8 fluid ounces; named after a cup for drinking tea or coffee while eating breakfast)
* Cup (6 fluid ounces; named after an everyday drinking cup)
* Teacup (5 fluid ounces; named after a typical teacup)
* Coffee cup ( fluid ounces; named after a small cup for serving after‑dinner coffee)
* Wine glass (2 fluid ounces; named after a small glass for serving liquor)
If the recipe is one that has been handed down in a family and gives measurements in ‘cups’, it is just as likely to refer to someone&#x27;s favourite kitchen cup as to the said unit that is 6 fluid ounces.

All six units are the traditional British equivalents of the US customary cup and the metric cup, used in situations where a US cook would use the US customary cup and a cook using metric units the metric cup. The breakfast cup is the most similar in size to the US customary cup and the metric cup. Which of these six units is used depends on the quantity or volume of the ingredient: there is division of labour between these six units, like the tablespoon and the teaspoon. British cookery books and recipes, especially those from the days before the UK&#x27;s partial metrication, commonly use two or more of the aforesaid units simultaneously: for example, the same recipe may call for a ‘tumblerful’ of one ingredient and a ‘wineglassful’ of another one; or a ‘breakfastcupful’ or ‘cupful’ of one ingredient, a ‘teacupful’ of a second one, and a ‘coffeecupful’ of a third one. Unlike the US customary cup and the metric cup, a tumbler, a breakfast cup, a cup, a teacup, a coffee cup, and a wine glass are not measuring cups: they are simply everyday drinking vessels commonly found in British households and typically having the respective aforementioned capacities; due to long-term and widespread use, they have been transformed into measurement units for cooking. There is not a British imperial unit⁠–⁠based culinary measuring cup.

For smaller amounts, British recipes traditionally give measurements in the following units:
* Tablespoon (4 fluid drachms or fluid ounce)
* Dessert spoon ( tablespoon: the equivalence of 2 fluid drachms or fluid ounce)
* Teaspoon ( dessert spoon or tablespoon: the equivalence of 1 fluid drachm or fluid ounce)
* Salt spoon ( teaspoon: the equivalence of 30 minims, fluid drachm, or fluid ounce)

For even smaller amounts, the following units are used:
* Pinch ( salt spoon or teaspoon: an amount of space that can accommodate 15 minims ( fluid drachm or fluid ounce) of liquid), if it is a dry ingredient
* Drop (1 minim, fluid drachm, or fluid ounce), if it is a liquid


American cooks using British recipes, and vice versa, need to be careful with pints and fluid ounces.
A US pint (16 US fluid ounces) is about 16·65 UK fluid ounces or 473 mL, while a UK pint is 20 UK fluid ounces (about 19·21 US fluid ounces or 568 mL): a UK pint is, therefore, about 20% larger than a US pint.
A US fluid ounce is of a US pint (about 1·04 UK fluid ounces or 29.6 mL); a UK fluid ounce is of a UK pint (about 0·96 US fluid ounce or 28.4 mL).

On a larger scale, perhaps for institutional cookery, a UK gallon is 8 UK pints (160 UK fluid ounces; about 1·2 US gallons or 4.546 litres), whereas the US gallon is 8 US pints (128 US fluid ounces; about 0·83 UK gallon or 3.785 litres).

The metric system was officially adopted in the UK, for most purposes, in the 20th century and both imperial and metric are taught in schools and used in books. It is now mandatory for the sale of food to also show metric. However, it is not uncommon to purchase goods which are measured and labeled in metric, but the actual measure is rounded to the equivalent imperial measure (i.e., milk labeled as 568 mL / 1 pint). In September 2007, the EU with Directive 2007/45/EC deregulated prescribed metric packaging of most products, leaving only wines and liqueurs subject to prescribed EU-wide pre-packaging legislation; the law relating to labelling of products remaining unchanged.

== Special instructions ==
Volume measures of compressible ingredients have a substantial measurement uncertainty, in the case of flour of about 20%. Some volume-based recipes, therefore, attempt to improve the reproducibility by including additional instructions for measuring the correct amount of an ingredient. For example, a recipe might call for &quot;1 cup brown sugar, firmly packed&quot;, or &quot;2 heaping cups flour&quot;. A few of the more common special measuring methods:

;Firmly packed
:With a spatula, a spoon, or by hand, the ingredient is pressed as tightly as possible into the measuring device.
;Lightly packed
:The ingredient is pressed lightly into the measuring device, only tightly enough to ensure no air pockets.
;Even / level
:A precise measure of an ingredient, discarding all of the ingredient that rises above the rim of the measuring device. Sweeping across the top of the measure with the back of a straight knife or the blade of a spatula is a common leveling method.
;Rounded
:Allowing a measure of an ingredient to pile up above the rim of the measuring device naturally, into a soft, rounded shape.
;Heaping / heaped
:The maximum amount of an ingredient which will stay on the measuring device.
;Sifted
:This instruction may be seen in two different ways, with two different meanings: before the ingredient, as &quot;1 cup sifted flour&quot;, indicates the ingredient should be sifted into the measuring device (and normally leveled), while after the ingredient, as &quot;1 cup flour, sifted&quot;, denotes the sifting should occur after measurement.

Such special instructions are unnecessary in weight-based recipes.

<doc id="52867" wikidata="Q165666" url="?curid=52867" title="Xylophone">
<text>The xylophone (; ) is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck by mallets. Each bar is an idiophone tuned to a pitch of a musical scale, whether pentatonic or heptatonic in the case of many African and Asian instruments, diatonic in many western children&#x27;s instruments, or chromatic for orchestral use.

The term &quot;xylophone&quot; may be used generally, to include all such instruments such as the marimba, balafon and even the semantron. However, in the orchestra, the term &quot;xylophone&quot; refers specifically to a chromatic instrument of somewhat higher pitch range and drier timbre than the marimba, and these two instruments should not be confused. A person who plays the xylophone is known as a &quot;xylophonist&quot; or simply a &quot;xylophone player&quot;.

The term is also popularly used to refer to similar instruments of the lithophone and metallophone types. For example, the Pixiphone and many similar toys described by the makers as xylophones have bars of metal rather than of wood, and so are in organology regarded as glockenspiels rather than as xylophones.

==Construction of xylophones==

The modern western xylophone has bars of rosewood, padauk, cocobolo, or various synthetic materials such as fiberglass or fiberglass-reinforced plastic which allows a louder sound. Some can be as small a range as octaves but concert xylophones are typically or 4 octaves. Like the glockenspiel, the xylophone is a transposing instrument: its parts are written one octave below the sounding notes.

Concert xylophones have tube resonators below the bars to enhance the tone and sustain. Frames are made of wood or cheap steel tubing: more expensive xylophones feature height adjustment and more stability in the stand. In other music cultures some versions have gourds that act as Helmholtz resonators. Others are &quot;trough&quot; xylophones with a single hollow body that acts as a resonator for all the bars. Old methods consisted of arranging the bars on tied bundles of straw, and, is still practiced today, placing the bars adjacent to each other in a ladder-like layout. Ancient mallets were made of willow wood with spoon-like bowls on the beaten ends.

== Mallets ==
Xylophones should be played with very hard rubber, polyball, or acrylic mallets. Sometimes medium to hard rubber mallets, very hard core, or yarn mallets are used for softer effects. Lighter tones can be created on xylophones by using wooden-headed mallets made from rosewood, ebony, birch, or other hard woods.

==History==

The instrument has obscure ancient origins. Nettl proposed that it originated in southeast Asia and came to Africa c. AD 500 when a group of Malayo-Polynesian speaking peoples migrated to Africa, and compared East African xylophone orchestras and Javanese and Balinese gamelan orchestras. This was more recently challenged by ethnomusicologist and linguist Roger Blench who posits an independent origin in of the Xylophone in Africa, citing, among the evidence for local invention, distinct features of African xylophones and the greater variety of xylophone types and proto-xylophone-like instruments in Africa.

===Asian xylophone===
The earliest evidence of a true xylophone is from the 9th century in southeast Asia, while a similar hanging wood instrument, a type of harmonicon, is said by the Vienna Symphonic Library to have existed in 2000 BC in what is now part of China. The xylophone-like ranat was used in Hindu regions (kashta tharang). In Indonesia, few regions have their own type of xylophones. In North Sumatra, The Toba Batak people use wooden xylophones known as the Garantung (spelled: &quot;garattung&quot;). Java and Bali use xylophones (called gambang, Rindik and Tingklik) in gamelan ensembles. They still have traditional significance in Malaysia, Melanesia, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, and regions of the Americas. In Myanmar, the xylophone is known as Pattala and is typically made of bamboo.

===African xylophone===

The term &quot;marimba&quot; is also applied to various traditional folk instruments such as the West Africa &quot;balafon&quot;. Early forms were constructed of bars atop a gourd. The wood is first roasted around a fire before shaping the key to achieve the desired tone. The resonator is tuned to the key through careful choice of size of resonator, adjustment of the diameter of the mouth of the resonator using wasp wax and adjustment of the height of the key above the resonator. A skilled maker can produce startling amplification. The mallets used to play &quot;dibinda&quot; and &quot;mbila&quot; have heads made from natural rubber taken from a wild creeping plant. &quot;Interlocking&quot; or alternating rhythm features in Eastern African xylophone music such as that of the Makonde &quot;dimbila&quot;, the Yao &quot;mangolongondo&quot; or the Shirima &quot;mangwilo&quot; in which the &quot;opachera&quot;, the initial caller, is responded to by another player, the &quot;wakulela&quot;. This usually doubles an already rapid rhythmic pulse that may also co-exist with a counter-rhythm.

====Mbila====

The mbila (plural &quot;timbila&quot;) is associated with the Chopi people of the Inhambane Province, in southern Mozambique. It is not to be confused with the mbira. The style of music played on it is believed to be the most sophisticated method of composition yet found among preliterate peoples. The gourd-resonated, equal-ratio heptatonic-tuned mbila of Mozambique is typically played in large ensembles in a choreographed dance, perhaps depicting a historical drama. Ensembles consist of around ten xylophones of three or four sizes. A full orchestra would have two bass instruments called with three or four wooden keys played standing up using heavy mallets with solid rubber heads, three tenor , with ten keys and played seated, and the mbila itself, which has up to nineteen keys of which up to eight may be played simultaneously. The uses gourds and the and Masala apple shells as resonators. They accompany the dance with long compositions called or and consist of about 10 pieces of music grouped into 4 separate movements, with an overture, in different tempos and styles. The ensemble leader serves as poet, composer, conductor and performer, creating a text, improvising a melody partially based on the features of the Chopi tone language and composing a second contrapuntal line. The musicians of the ensemble partially improvise their parts. The composer then consults with the choreographer of the ceremony and adjustments are made. The longest and most important of these is the &quot;Mzeno&quot; which will include a song telling of an issue of local importance or even making fun of a prominent figure in the community! Performers include Eduardo Durão and Venancio Mbande.

====Gyil====

The gyil () is a pentatonic instrument common to the Gur-speaking populations in Ghana, Burkina Faso, Mali and Ivory Coast in West Africa. The Gyil is the primary traditional instrument of the Dagara people of northern Ghana and Burkina Faso, and of the Lobi of Ghana, southern Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. The gyil is usually played in pairs, accompanied by a calabash gourd drum called a &quot;kuor&quot;. It can also be played by one person with the drum and the stick part as accompaniment, or by a soloist. Gyil duets are the traditional music of Dagara funerals. The instrument is generally played by men, who learn to play while young, however, there is no restriction on gender.

The Gyil&#x27;s design is similar to the &quot;Balaba&quot; or Balafon used by the Mande-speaking Bambara, Dyula and Sosso peoples further west in southern Mali and western Burkina Faso, a region that shares many musical traditions with those of northern Ivory Coast and Ghana. It is made with 14 wooden keys of an African hardwood called liga attached to a wooden frame, below which hang calabash gourds. Spider web silk covers small holes in the gourds to produce a buzzing sound and antelope sinew and leather are used for the fastenings. The instrument is played with rubber-headed wooden mallets.

====Silimba====

The silimba is a xylophone common among the Nkoya and Lozi people of Barotseland, western Zambia. The tuned keys are tied atop resonating gourds. Known as shinjimba among the Nkoya, it is used at the Kazanga, a traditional royal ceremony of the Nkoya. The silimba is an essential part of the folk music traditions of the Lozi people and can be heard at their annual Kuomboka ceremony. The shilimba is now used in most parts of Zambia.

====Akadinda, amadinda and mbaire====
The akadinda and the amadinda are xylophone-like instruments originating in Buganda, in modern-day Uganda. The amadinda is made of twelve logs which are tuned in a pentatonic scale. It mainly is played by three players. Two players sit opposite of each other and play the same logs in an interlocking technique in a fast tempo. It has no gourd resonators or buzzing tone, two characteristics of many other African xylophones.

The amadinda was an important instrument at the royal court in Buganda, a Ugandan kingdom. A special type of notation is now used for this xylophone, consisting of numbers for and periods. as is also the case with the embaire, a type of xylophone originating in southern Uganda.

====Balo====

The balo (balenjeh, behlanjeh) is used among the Mandinka people of West Africa. Its keys are mounted on gourds, and struck with mallets with rubber tips. The players typically wear iron cylinders and rings attached to their hands so that they jingle as they play.

===Western xylophone===

The earliest mention of a xylophone in Europe was in Arnolt Schlick&#x27;s &quot;Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten&quot; (1511), where it is called &quot;hültze glechter&quot; (&quot;wooden clatter&quot;). There follow other descriptions of the instrument, though the term &quot;xylophone&quot; is not used until the 1860s. The instrument was associated largely with the folk music of Central Europe, notably Poland and eastern Germany. An early version appeared in Slovakia and the earliest reference to a similar instrument came in the 14th century.

The first use of a European orchestral xylophone was in Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, in 1874. By that time, the instrument had already been popularized to some extent by Michael Josef Gusikov, whose instrument was the five-row xylophone made of 28 crude wooden bars arranged in semitones in the form of a trapezoid and resting on straw supports. There were no resonators and it was played fast with spoon-shaped sticks. According to musicologist Curt Sachs, Gusikov performed in garden concerts, variety shows, and as a novelty act at symphony concerts.

The western xylophone was used by early jazz bands and in vaudeville. Its bright, lively sound worked well the syncopated dance music of the 1920s and 1930s. Red Norvo, George Cary, George Hamilton Green, Teddy Brown, Harry Breuer and Harry Robbins were among the well-known players. As time passed, the xylophone was exceeded in popularity by the metal-key vibraphone, which was developed in the 1920s. A xylophone with a range extending downwards into the marimba range is called a xylorimba.

In orchestral scores, a xylophone can be indicated by the French &quot;claquebois&quot;, German &quot;Holzharmonika&quot; (literally &quot;wooden harmonica&quot;), or Italian &quot;silofono&quot;. Shostakovich was particularly fond of the instrument; it has prominent roles in much of his work, including most of his symphonies and his Cello Concerto No. 2. Modern xylophone players include Bob Becker, Evelyn Glennie and Ian Finkel.

In the United States, there are Zimbabwean marimba bands in particularly high concentration in the Pacific Northwest, Colorado, and New Mexico, but bands exist from the East Coast through California and even to Hawaii and Alaska. The main event for this community is ZimFest, the annual Zimbabwean Music Festival. The bands are composed of instruments from high sopranos, through to lower soprano, tenor, baritone, and bass. Resonators are usually made with holes covered by thin cellophane (similar to the balafon) to achieve the characteristic buzzing sound. The repertoires of U.S. bands tends to have a great overlap, due to the common source of the Zimbabwean musician Dumisani Maraire, who was the key person who first brought Zimbabwean music to the West, coming to the University of Washington in 1968.

==Use in elementary education==

Many music educators use xylophones as a classroom resource to assist children&#x27;s musical development. One method noted for its use of xylophones is Orff-Schulwerk, which combines the use of instruments, movement, singing and speech to develop children&#x27;s musical abilities. Xylophones used in American general music classrooms are smaller, at about octaves, than the or more octave range of performance xylophones. The bass xylophone ranges are written from middle C to A an octave higher but sound one octave lower than written. The alto ranges are written from middle C to A an octave higher and sound as written. The soprano ranges are written from middle C to A an octave higher but sound one octave higher than written.

According to Andrew Tracey, marimbas were introduced to Zimbabwe in 1960. Zimbabwean marimba based upon Shona music has also become popular in the West, which adopted the original use of these instruments to play transcriptions of mbira dzavadzimu (as well as &quot;nyunga nyunga&quot; and &quot;matepe&quot;) music. The first of these transcriptions had originally been used for music education in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwean instruments are often in a diatonic C major scale, which allows them to be played with a &#x27;western-tuned&#x27; mbira (G nyamaropa), sometimes with an added F key placed inline.

<doc id="52869" wikidata="Q784148" url="?curid=52869" title="Braising">
<text>Braising (from the French word &quot;braiser&quot;) is a combination-cooking method that uses both wet and dry heats: typically, the food is first browned at a high temperature, then simmered in a covered pot in cooking liquid (such as wine, broth, coconut milk or beer). It is similar to stewing, but braising is done with less liquid and usually used for larger cuts of meat. Braising of meat is often referred to as pot roasting, though some authors make a distinction between the two methods, based on whether additional liquid is added. Osso buco and coq au vin are well known braised meat dishes, and the technique can also be used to prepare fish, tempeh, tofu, or fruits and vegetables.

==Techniques==
Most braises follow the same basic steps. The food to be braised (meats, vegetables, mushrooms, etc.) is first pan-seared to brown its surface and enhance its flavor (through the Maillard reaction). If the food will not produce enough liquid of its own, a certain amount of cooking liquid that often includes an acidic element (e.g., tomatoes, beer, balsamic vinegar, wine) is added to the pot, often with stock. A classic braise is done with a relatively whole cut of meat, and the braising liquid will cover two-thirds of the food in the pan. The dish is then covered and cooked at a very low simmer until the meat becomes so tender that it can be &quot;cut&quot; with just the gentlest of pressure from a fork (versus a knife). Often the cooking liquid is finished to create a sauce or gravy as well.

Sometimes foods with high water content (particularly vegetables) can be cooked in their own juices, making the addition of liquid unnecessary.

Despite a common misconception that braising adds moisture to meat, the opposite is true, and the appearance of moisture comes from gentle cooking breaking down connective tissue and collagen, which lubricates and tenderizes fibers. 

==Braised foods==
Braising is used extensively in the cuisines of Asia, particularly Chinese cuisine and Vietnamese cuisine, where soy sauce (or, in Vietnam, soy sauce and fish sauce) is often added to the braising liquid.

<doc id="52871" wikidata="Q220971" url="?curid=52871" title="Marimba">
<text>The marimba ( ) is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars that are struck by mallets. Below each bar is a resonator pipe that amplifies particular harmonics of its sound. Compared to the xylophone, the marimba has a lower range. Typically, the bars of a marimba are arranged chromatically, like the keys of a piano. The marimba is a type of idiophone.

Today, the marimba is used as a solo instrument, or in ensembles like orchestras, marching bands (typically as a part of the front ensemble), percussion ensembles, brass and concert bands, and other traditional ensembles.

== Etymology and terminology ==

The term &quot;marimba&quot; refers to both the traditional version of this instrument and its modern form. Its first documented use in the English language dates back to 1704. The term is of Bantu origin, deriving from the prefix meaning &#x27;many&#x27; and meaning &#x27;xylophone&#x27;. The term is akin to Kikongo and Swahili or .

== History ==

===Ancient===

Instruments like the marimba are present throughout the entirety of sub-Saharan Africa. The instrument itself is most similar and shares its name with the marimbas of modern-day Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, it is also similar to instruments that exist in West Africa such as the balafon of the Mandinka people, known as gyil among the Gur peoples in and around northern Ghana and Burkina Faso.

=== Mexico ===
The first known marimba dates back to 1545 in the Santa Lucía hacienda, in the municipality of Jiquipilas, Chiapas. According to documentation dated October 9, 1545, the encomendero Don Pedro Gentil de Bustamante and owner of the hacienda of Santa Lucia, describes in his chronicle a marimba in a celebration of Indians; and tells us the following:.

It is believed that xylophones came to America by means of Africans who had been taken to Guatemala and Mexico, although there are also records in some Mayan pyramids found in Chiapas and Guatemala. The first documented mention of the marimba in Guatemala (marimba de tecomates), dates from November 13, 1680 during the inauguration celebrations of the Santa Iglesia Catedral in Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala.

The modern double keyboard marimba was created in 1892, in Chiapas, Mexico, thanks to the talent and innovation of Corazón de Jesús Borras Moreno, a native of the Municipality of Venustiano Carranza, Chiapas, Mexico. In 1897, the current model of marimba was played for the first time in the traditional park of the church of Señor del Pozo, in the same municipality, from that moment it has gone from being a native instrument to a concert instrument. A five-octave instrument was first built, and later an 11-octave, huge instrument was built, which was played by 9 elements.

In Central America there are two versions of its origin. Some claim that it was brought by black slaves from Africa, while others consider it native, created by the Maya-quiche.

Historian David Vela says: “We also refer to the thesis of Dr. Castañeda Paganini on the possible invention of the marimba in Guatemala, by Africans brought as slaves in the sixteenth century; it is surprising however that the marimba appears here early among communities closed to their influence, among remote mountains, and is missing in the areas actually inhabited by the colored race.” what is undoubted is that the ingenuity of the local countries transformed the instrument to the point of making it their own.

Since there are records in Guatemala that in the middle of the 18th century, in the same city of Santiago de Guatemala (today Antigua Guatemala), the presbyter Joseph de Padilla developed a new version of the instrument (simple marimba), to which he extended the extension of the keyboard to 42 keys (first and only collective instrument in the world), he added a structure with 4 legs raising it from the ground, being able to play standing up.

In 1894 in Quetzaltenango, the master Sebastián Hurtado developed the first chromatic marimba or double keyboard marimba made of Hormigo wood (Plathymiscium dimorphandrum) giving it up to 6 musical scales. He inherited the marimba to his sons and they created the group Marimba Royal of the Hurtado brothers who in 1908 performed a concert in the city of Buffalo, New York, and thus introduced the marimba (with the contributions of Guatemala) in the United States, making it known to the world.

Being an instrument used in many countries of the Americas, on February 12, 2015, the Organization of American States (OAS) declares the marimba “Cultural Heritage of the Americas”.

=== Central America ===
The marimba is popular throughout Central America, with its popularity spreading from southern Mexico to Costa Rica. The first historical account in Central America is from 1550 where enslaved Africans in Guatemala are reported playing it. By 1680 accounts of Maya musicians using marimbas with gourd resonator were made in Guatemala. It became more widespread during the 18th and 19th centuries, as Maya and Ladino ensembles started using it on festivals. In 1821, the marimba was proclaimed the national instrument of Guatemala in its independence proclamation.

=== South America ===


Marimba&#x27;s second range of popularity in Latin America is in the Pacific coast of Colombia and Ecuador. The instruments were brought there via the African diaspora and their cultural significance has survived to the present day. The Afro-Latino communities that take part in preserving and playing it value its importance as a touchstone of their resilience.

In Colombia the most widespread marimba is the &quot;marimba de chonta&quot; (peach-palm marimba). Marimba music has been listed on UNESCO as an intangible part of Colombian culture. In recent times &quot;marimberos&quot; (marimba players) and the marimba genres as a whole have started to fade out in popularity. Nonetheless, the genre is still popular in the departments of Chocó and Cauca.

In Ecuador the most widespread marimba is the &quot;marimba esmeraldeña&quot; (Esmeralda marimba). Marimbas are an important aspect of Afro-Ecuadorian culture: many religious ceremonies and songs are accompanied with marimba music along with festivals and dances. It is most popular in the province of Esmeraldas where in the 16th century Alonso de Illescas, a maroon, found a maroon settlement near the area around modern day Esmeraldas. In that province, it evokes a sense of pride for the community in which years centuries marimba music has been prohibited after government encroachment upon the Esmeraldas province.

=== Modern ===

Marimbas have become widely popular around the world since it was being used throughout Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Central America.

In 1850, Mexican marimbist Manuel Bolán Cruz (1810–1863), modified the old bow marimba, by the wooden straight one, lengthening the legs so that the musicians could play in a standing mode, expanded the keyboard and replaced the gourd resonators by wooden boxes.

In 1892, Mexican musician expanded the range of the marimba to include the chromatic scale by adding another row of sound bars, akin to black keys on the piano.

The name &quot;marimba&quot; was later applied to the orchestra instrument inspired by the Latin American model. In the United States, companies like J.C. Deagan and the Leedy Manufacturing Company adapted the Latin American instruments for use in Western music. Metal tubes were used as resonators, fine-tuned by rotating metal discs at the bottom; lowest note tubes were U-shaped. The marimbas were first used for light music and dance, such as vaudeville theater and comedy shows. Clair Omar Musser was a chief proponent of marimba in the United States at the time.

In 1940, the American composer Paul Creston wrote the first composition for solo marimba (&quot;Concertino for Marimba and Orchestra&quot;). French composer Darius Milhaud also helped introduce marimbas into Western classical music with his 1947 &quot;Concerto for Marimba and Vibraphone&quot;. Four-mallet grip was employed to play chords, enhancing interest for the instrument. In the late 20th century, modernist and contemporary composers found new ways to use marimba: notable examples include Leoš Janáček (&quot;Jenufa&quot;), Carl Orff (&quot;Antigonae&quot;), Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Hans Werner Henze (&quot;Elegy for Young Lovers&quot;), Pierre Boulez (&quot;Le marteau sans maître&quot;) and Steve Reich.

== Construction ==
=== Bars ===
Marimba bars may be made either of wood or a synthetic fiberglass material. For the best sound quality, rosewood is the most desirable, while padauk is a popular affordable alternative. Synthetic fiberglass bars are often sold under trade names such as Kelon (for Ludwig-Musser), Klyperon (for J.C. Deagan), or Acoustalon (for Yamaha), among others. Bars made from synthetic materials generally fall short in sound quality and generally have a longer decay in comparison to wooden bars, but they are often less expensive and yield added durability and weather resistance, making them suitable for outdoor use. For wooden bars, changes in humidity or temperature may alter the moisture levels within the wood. This may negatively affect the pitch and tonality of the bar.

Bubinga (&quot;Guibourtia demeusei&quot;) and mahogany have also been cited as comparable to rosewood in quality for use as marimba bars. The specific rosewood, &quot;Dalbergia stevensonii&quot;, only grows in Southern Guatemala and Belize, formerly British Honduras. This wood has a Janka rating of 2200, which is about three times harder than silver maple. The bars are wider and longer at the lowest-pitched notes, and gradually get narrower and shorter as the notes get higher. During the tuning, wood is taken from the middle underside of the bar to lower the pitch. Because of this, the bars are also thinner in the lowest pitch register and thicker in the highest pitch register. While most American marimbas are tuned to the standard A4=440 Hz, many commercial marimbas are tuned to A4=442 Hz for a brighter sound for better blend with an orchestra.

Marimba bars produce their fullest sound when struck just off center, while striking the bar in the center produces a more articulate tone. On chromatic marimbas, the accidentals can also be played on the extreme front edge of the bar, away from the node (the place where the string goes through the bar) if necessary. Playing on the node produces a sonically weak tone, and the technique is only used when the player or composer is looking for a muted sound from the instrument.


=== Range ===
There is no standard range of the marimba, but the most common ranges are 4.3 octaves, 4.5 octaves and 5 octaves; 4, 4.6 and 5.5 octave sizes are also available.

*4 octave: C3 to C7.
*4.3 octave: A2 to C7. The .3 refers to three semitones below the 4 octave instrument. This is the most common range.
*4.5 octave: F2 to C7. The .5 means &quot;half&quot;;
*4.6 octave: E2 to C7, one semitone below the 4.5. Useful for playing guitar literature and transcriptions.
*5 octave: C2 to C7, one full octave below the 4 octave instrument, useful for playing cello transcriptions, e.g., J. S. Bach&#x27;s cello suites.
*Bass range (varies, but examples range from G1–G3 or C2–F3)

The range of the marimba has been gradually expanding, with companies like Marimba One adding notes up to F above the normal high C (C7) on their 5.5 octave instrument and marimba tuners adding notes lower than the low C on the 5 octave C2. Adding lower notes is somewhat impractical; as the bars become bigger and the resonators become longer, the instrument must be taller and the mallets must be softer in order to produce a tone rather than just a percussive attack. Adding higher notes is also impractical because the hardness of the mallets required to produce the characteristic tone of a marimba are much too hard to play with in almost any other, lower range on the instrument.

The marimba is a non-transposing instrument with no octave displacement, unlike the xylophone, which sounds one octave higher than written, and the glockenspiel, which sounds two octaves higher than written.

=== Resonators ===
Part of the key to the marimba&#x27;s rich sound are its resonators. These are tubes (usually aluminum) that hang below each bar.

In the most traditional versions, various sizes of natural gourds are attached below the keys to act as resonators; in more sophisticated versions carved wooden resonators are substituted, allowing for more precise tuning of pitch. In Central America and Mexico, a hole is often carved into the bottom of each resonator and then covered with a delicate membrane taken from the intestine of a pig to add a characteristic &quot;buzzing&quot; or &quot;rattling&quot; sound known as &quot;charleo&quot;. In more contemporary-style marimbas, wood is replaced by PVC tubing. The holes in the bottoms of the tubes are covered with a thin layer of paper to produce the buzzing noise.

The length of the resonators varies according to the frequency that the bar produces. Vibrations from the bars resonate as they pass through the tubes, which amplify the tone in a manner very similar to the way in which the body of a guitar or cello would. In instruments exceeding octaves, the length of tubing required for the bass notes exceeds the height of the instrument. Some manufacturers, such as DeMorrow and Malletech, compensate for this by bending the ends of the tubes. This involves soldering smaller straight sections of tubes to form &quot;curved&quot; tubes. Both DeMorrow and Malletech use brass rather than aluminium. Others, such as Adams and Yamaha, expand the tubes into large box-shaped bottoms, resulting in the necessary amount of resonating space without having to extend the tubes. This result is achieved by the custom manufacturer Marimba One by widening the resonators into an oval shape, with the lowest ones reaching nearly a foot in width, and doubling the tube up inside the lowest resonators—a process known as &quot;Haskelling&quot;, originally used in pipe organ resonators, and named for its inventor, William E. Haskell.

Resonator tuning involves adjusting &quot;stops&quot; in the tubes themselves to compensate for temperature and humidity conditions in the room where the instrument is stored. Some companies offer adjustment in the upper octaves only. Others do not have any adjustable stops. Still some companies (Malletech and DeMorrow) offer full-range adjustable stops.

On many marimbas, decorative resonators are added to fill the gaps in the accidental resonator bank. In addition to this, the resonator lengths are sometimes altered to form a decorative arch, such as in the Musser M-250. This does not affect the resonant properties, because the end plugs in the resonators are still placed at their respective lengths.

=== Mallets ===

The mallet shaft is commonly made of wood, usually birch, but may also be rattan or fiberglass. The most common diameter of the shaft is around . Shafts made of rattan have a certain elasticity to them, while birch has almost no give. Professionals use both depending on their preferences, whether they are playing with two mallets or more, and which grip they use if they are using a four-mallet grip.

Appropriate mallets for the instrument depend on the range. The material at the end of the shaft is almost always a type of rubber, usually wrapped with yarn. Softer mallets are used at the lowest notes, and harder mallets are used at the highest notes. Mallets that are too hard will damage the instrument, and mallets that might be appropriate for the upper range could damage the notes in the lower range (especially on a padouk or rosewood instrument). On the lower notes, the bars are larger, and require a softer mallet to bring out a strong fundamental. Because of the need to use varying hardnesses of mallets, some players, when playing with four or more mallets, might use graduated mallets to match the bars that they are playing (softer on the left, harder on the right).

Some mallets, called &quot;two-toned&quot; or &quot;multi-tonal&quot;, have a hard core, loosely wrapped with yarn. These are designed to sound articulate when playing at a loud dynamic, and broader at the quieter dynamics.

== Mallet technique ==
Modern marimba music calls for simultaneous use of between two and four mallets (sometimes up to six or eight), granting the performer the ability to play chords or music with large interval skips more easily. Multiple mallets are held in the same hand using any of a number of techniques or &quot;grips&quot;. For four mallets (two mallets in each hand), the most common grips are the Burton grip (made popular by Gary Burton), the traditional grip (or &quot;cross grip&quot;) and the Musser-Stevens grip (made popular by Leigh Howard Stevens). Each grip is perceived to have its own benefits and drawbacks. For example, some marimbists feel the Musser-Stevens grip is more suitable for quick interval changes and mallet independence, while the Burton grip is more suitable for stronger playing or switching between chords and single-note melody lines. The traditional grip gives a greater dynamic range and freedom of playing. The choice of grip varies by region (the Musser-Stevens grip and the Burton grip are more popular in the United States, while the traditional grip is more popular in Japan), by instrument (the Burton grip is less likely to be used on marimba than on a vibraphone) and by the preference of the individual performer.

Six-mallet grips consist of variations on these three grips. Six-mallet marimba grips have been used for years by Mexican and Central American marimbists, but they are generally considered non-standard in the Western classical canon. Keiko Abe has written a number of compositions for six mallets, including a section in her concerto &quot;Prism Rhapsody&quot;. Other marimbists/composers using this technique include Rebecca Kite (who commissioned composer Evan Hause to write &quot;Circe&quot;, a major work for six mallets, in 2001), Dean Gronemeier, Robert Paterson, and Kai Stensgaard. Paterson&#x27;s grip is based on the Burton grip, and his grip and technique have been called the Paterson grip, and even the Wolverine grip. Paterson states that his technique differs from others in that there is less emphasis places on block chords on the lower bank of notes (the naturals or white notes) and more emphasis on independence, one-handed rolls, and alternations between mallets 12-3 or 1–23 in the left hand (or 45-6 or 4–56 in the right hand, respectively), and so on. Ludwig Albert published at first a work for eight mallets and demonstrated the Ludwig Albert eight-mallet grip based on the traditional grip from 1995.

== Repertoire ==
=== Orchestra ===
The marimba is less used by composers than other keyboards from orchestral percussion section, although its interest increased after 1950 such as in Le marteau sans maître by Pierre Boulez.

=== Concertos ===
The first solo marimba concerto, Concertino for Marimba, was composed by Paul Creston in 1940, after a commission by Frédérique Petrides. The Concertino for Marimba premiered on 29 April 1940 in Carnegie Hall with marimba soloist Ruth Stuber Jeanne and the Orchestrette Classique. The second concerto for the marimba, Concerto for Marimba, Vibraphone and Orchestra, was written by Darius Milhaud in 1947.

The Oregon Symphony Orchestra commissioned Tomáš Svoboda to compose Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra, Op. 148, in 1995. A recording of the piece by the orchestra and Niel DePonte was nominated for the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra).

Other prominent concertos include Concerto No. 1 for Marimba and String Orchestra written in 1986 by Ney Rosauro and Concerto for Marimba and String Orchestra written in 2006 by Emmanuel Séjourné.

=== Solos ===
The marimba is the most popular solo keyboard percussion instrument in classical music. Popular marimba solos range from beginner solos such as &quot;Yellow After the Rain&quot; and &quot;Sea Refractions&quot; by Mitchell Peters to more advanced works such as &quot;Variations on Lost Love&quot; by David Maslanka, &quot;Rhythmic Caprice&quot; by Leigh Howard Stevens and &quot;Khan Variations&quot; by Alejandro Viñao.

== Popular music ==
Traditional marimba bands are especially popular in Guatemala, where they are the national symbol of culture, but are also strongly established in the Mexican states of Chiapas, Tabasco, and Oaxaca. They are also very popular in other Central American nations such as Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, as well as among Afro-Ecuadorians and Afro-Colombians.

There have been numerous jazz vibraphonists who also played the marimba. Notable among them are Gary Burton, David Friedman, Stefon Harris, Bobby Hutcherson, Joe Locke, Steve Nelson, Red Norvo, Dave Pike, Gloria Parker, Dave Samuels, and Arthur Lipner.

Marimbist and vibraphonist Julius Wechter was the leader of a popular 1960s Latin-flavored band called Baja Marimba Band. Herb Alpert and his Tijuana Brass made frequent use of the marimba.

Ruth Underwood played an electrically amplified marimba in Frank Zappa&#x27;s The Mothers of Invention.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1966 song &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; prominently features a marimba, played by Brian Jones.

A marimba solo was in the hit 1975 Starbuck song &quot;Moonlight Feels Right&quot;.

The 1982 Toto hit “Africa” prominently features the marimba, played by Joe Porcaro.

The version of the song “Tonight” by David Bowie and Iggy Pop featured on Bowie’s 1984 album of the same title includes a marimba.

Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1985 soundtrack album &quot;Birdy&quot; includes the song &quot;Slow Marimbas.&quot;

<text>The vibraphone (also called the vibraharp) is a percussion instrument in the metallophone family. It consists of tuned metal bars and is typically played by using mallets to strike the bars. A person who plays the vibraphone is called a &quot;vibraphonist,&quot; &quot;vibraharpist,&quot; or &quot;vibist&quot;.

The vibraphone resembles the steel marimba, which it superseded. One of the main differences between the vibraphone and other keyboard percussion instruments is that each bar suspends over a resonator tube containing a flat metal disc. These discs are attached together by a common axle and spin when the motor is turned on. This causes the instrument to produce its namesake tremolo or vibrato effect. The vibraphone also has a sustain pedal similar to a piano. When the pedal is up, the bars produce a muted sound; when the pedal is down, the bars sustain for several seconds or until again muted with the pedal.

The vibraphone is commonly used in jazz music, in which it often plays a featured role, and was a defining element of the sound of mid-20th-century &quot;Tiki lounge&quot; exotica, as popularized by Arthur Lyman. It is the second most popular solo keyboard percussion instrument in classical music, after the marimba, and is part of the standard college-level percussion performance education. It is a standard instrument in the modern percussion section for orchestras, concert bands, and in the marching arts (typically as part of the front ensemble).

==History==
=== Invention ===
Around 1916, instrument maker Herman Winterhoff of the Leedy Manufacturing Company began experimenting with &quot;vox humana&quot; effects on a three-octave (F to F) steel marimba. His original design attempted to produce this effect by raising and lowering the resonators, which caused a noticeable vibrato. In 1921, Winterhoff perfected the design by instead attaching a motor that rotated small discs underneath the bars to achieve the same effect. After sales manager George H. Way termed this instrument the &quot;vibraphone&quot;, it was marketed by Leedy starting in 1924. The Leedy vibraphone managed to achieve a decent degree of popularity after it was used in the novelty recordings of &quot;Aloha ʻOe&quot; and &quot;Gypsy Love Song&quot; in 1924 by vaudeville performer Louis Frank Chiha.

However, this instrument differed significantly from the instrument now called the &quot;vibraphone&quot;. The Leedy vibraphone did not have a pedal mechanism, and it had bars made of steel rather than aluminum. The growing popularity of Leedy&#x27;s instrument led competitor J. C. Deagan, Inc., the inventor of the original steel marimba on which Leedy&#x27;s design was based, to ask its chief tuner, Henry Schluter, to develop a similar instrument in 1927. Instead of just copying the Leedy design, Schluter introduced several significant improvements. He made the bars from aluminum instead of steel for a mellower tone, adjusted the dimensions and tuning of the bars to eliminate the dissonant harmonics present in the Leedy design, and introduced a foot-controlled damper bar. Schluter&#x27;s design became more popular than the Leedy design and has become the template for all instruments now called a &quot;vibraphone&quot;.

Both the terms &quot;vibraphone&quot; and &quot;vibraharp&quot; were trademarked by Leedy and Deagan, respectively. Other manufacturers were forced to use the generic name &quot;vibes&quot; or devise new trade names such as &quot;vibraceleste&quot; for their instruments incorporating the newer design.

=== Use ===

While the initial purpose of the vibraphone was as a novelty instrument for vaudeville orchestras, that use was quickly overwhelmed in the 1930s by its development in jazz music. The use of the vibraphone in jazz was popularized by Lionel Hampton, a jazz drummer from California. At one recording session with bandleader Louis Armstrong, Hampton was asked to play a vibraphone that had been left behind in the studio. This resulted in the recording of the song &quot;Memories of You&quot; in 1930, containing what is often considered to be the first instance of an improvised vibraphone solo.

In its early history, the vibraphone was often used in classical music to give compositions a jazz influence. The first known composer to use the vibraphone was Havergal Brian in his 1917 opera, &quot;The Tigers&quot;, which called for two of them. However, since the piece was lost and did not premiere until 1983, Ferde Grofé&#x27;s &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot;, completed in 1931, is sometimes considered to be the first piece to use a vibraphone instead. Other early classical composers to use the vibraphone were Alban Berg, who used it prominently in his opera &quot;Lulu&quot; in 1935, and William Grant Still, who used it in his &quot;Afro-American Symphony&quot; that same year. While the vibraphone has not been used quite as extensively in the realm of classical music as it has with jazz, it can often be heard in theatre or film music, such as in Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

==Characteristics==
=== Range ===
The standard modern instrument has a range of 3 octaves, starting from the F below middle C (F to F in scientific pitch notation). Larger or 4 octave models from the C below middle C are also becoming more common (C to F or C). Unlike its cousin, the glockenspiel, the vibraphone is generally a non-transposing instrument, written at concert pitch.

===Mallets===
Vibraphone mallets usually consist of a rubber ball core wrapped in yarn or cord and attached to a narrow dowel, most commonly made of rattan or birch and sometimes of fiberglass or nylon. Mallets suitable for the vibraphone are also generally suitable for the marimba.

The mallets can have a great effect on the timbre, ranging from a bright metallic clang to a mellow ring with no obvious initial attack. Consequently, a wide array of mallets is available, offering variations in hardness, head size, weight, shaft length and flexibility.

Classical players must carry a wide range of mallet types to accommodate the changing demands of composers who are looking for particular sounds. Jazz players, on the other hand, often make use of multi-purpose mallets to allow for improvisation.

==Construction==
=== Bars ===

Vibraphone bars are made from aluminum bar stock, cut into blanks of predetermined length. Holes are drilled through the width of the bars, so they can be suspended by a cord (typically paracord). To maximize the sustain of the bars, the holes are placed at approximately the nodal points of the bar (i.e., the points of minimum amplitude around which the bar vibrates). For a uniform bar, the nodal points are located 22.4% from each end of the bar.

Material is ground away from the underside of the bars in an arch shape to lower the pitch. This allows the lower-pitched bars to be a manageable length. It is also the key to the mellow sound of the vibraphone (and marimba, which uses the same deep arch) compared with the brighter xylophone, which uses a shallower arch, and the glockenspiel, which has no arch at all. These rectangular bars have three primary modes of vibration. The deep arch causes these modes to align and create a consonant arrangement of intervals: a fundamental pitch, a pitch two octaves above that, and a third pitch an octave and a major third above the second. For the F bar that usually forms the lowest note on a vibraphone, there would be F as the fundamental, F as the first overtone, and A as the second overtone. As a side effect, the arch causes the nodal points of the fundamental vibration to shift closer towards the ends of the bar.

After beveling or rounding the edges, fine-tuning adjustments are made. If a bar is flat, its overall pitch structure can be raised by removing material from the ends of the bar. Once this slightly sharp bar is created, the secondary and tertiary tones can be lowered by removing material from specific locations of the bar. Vibraphones are tuned to a standard of A = 442 Hz or A = 440 Hz, depending on the manufacturer or the customer&#x27;s preference. While concert pitch is generally A = 440 Hz, the sharper tuning of A = 442 Hz is used to give the vibraphone a slightly brighter sound to cut through the ensemble.

Like marimbas, professional vibraphones have bars of graduated width. Lower bars are made from wider stock, and higher notes from narrower stock, to help balance volume and tone across the range of the instrument. The bars are anodized after fine-tuning (typically in a silver or gold color) and may have a glossy or matte finish. These are cosmetic features with a negligible effect on the sound.

The bed for the bars is made by laying down four wooden rails onto each end of the frame. Each rail has a series of pins with rubber spacers. As the cord passes through the holes of the bar, they rest on the pins to suspend the bars. On each outer side, the ends of the cord attach together with a spring to provide tension and flex.

===Resonators===
Resonators are thin-walled tubes, typically made of aluminum, but any suitably strong material can be used. They are open at one end and closed at the other. Each bar is paired with a resonator whose diameter is slightly wider than the width of the bar and whose length to the closure is one-quarter of the wavelength of the fundamental frequency of the bar. When the bar and resonator are properly in tune with each other, the vibrating air beneath the bar travels down the resonator and is reflected from the closure at the bottom, then returns to the top and is reflected back by the bar, over and over, creating a much stronger standing wave and increasing the amplitude of the fundamental frequency. The resonators, besides raising the upper end of the vibraphone&#x27;s dynamic range, also affect the overall tone of the vibraphone, since they amplify the fundamental frequency, but not the upper partials.

There is a trade-off between the amplifying effect of the resonators and the length of sustain of a ringing bar. The energy in a ringing bar comes from the initial mallet strike, and that energy can either be used to make the bar ring louder initially, or not as loudly but for a longer period of time. This is not an issue with marimbas and xylophones, where the natural sustain time of the wooden bars is short, but vibraphone bars can ring for many seconds after being struck, and this effect is highly desirable in many circumstances. Therefore, the resonators in a vibraphone are usually tuned slightly off-pitch to create a balance between loudness and sustain.

A unique feature of vibraphone resonators is the shaft of rotating discs, commonly called fans, across the top. When the fans are open, the resonators have full function. When the fans are closed, the resonators are partially occluded, reducing the resonance of the fundamental pitch. A drive belt connects the shafts to an electric motor beneath the playing surface and rotates the fans. This rotation of the fans creates a tremolo effect and a slight vibrato.

Oftentimes, vibraphones, and other mallet instruments, will include non-functional, decorative resonator tubes with no corresponding bar above to make the instrument look more complete.

In 1970, Deagan introduced the ElectraVibe, which dispensed with resonator tubes entirely and took a signal directly from the bars, adding a tremolo in a preamplifier. This sought to improve the portability of the instrument and solve the problem inherent in all tuned mallet instruments: miking the bars evenly.

===Damper mechanism===
For the first few years of production, the original Leedy vibraphone did not include a mechanism for damping, or stopping, the sustaining tones. In 1927, the J.C. Deagan company introduced a pedal mechanism that has not changed substantially since. A rigid bar beneath the center of the instrument is pressed upward by an adjustable spring and engages a long felt pad against the sharps and the naturals. A foot pedal lowers the bar and allows notes to ring freely; releasing the pedal engages the damper and stops any vibrating notes. One common flaw of this damping mechanism is that the bar is often supported at one point in the middle, causing it to damp the instrument unevenly in the upper and lower registers. To combat this, some manufacturers have made silicone- or liquid-filled damper pads whose fluid shape can conform evenly around the bars.

===Motor===

Vibraphones usually have an electric motor and pulley assembly mounted on one side or the other to drive the disks in the resonators. Often, especially within classical music, the vibraphone is played with the motor off. Certain models for outdoor use as part of a front ensemble have the motor removed entirely. In those cases having the motor off is the norm and is not used unless specifically called for.

The early vibraphones used motors that were intended to power record-player turntables and had limited to no speed-adjustment capabilities. Whatever speed adjustments were possible were made by moving the drive belt among a small number of pulleys (usually three) of varying diameters. Later, variable-speed AC motors became available at reasonable prices. These motors allow the adjustment of the rotating speed by a potentiometer mounted on a control panel near the motor. They typically support rotation rates in the range of 1–12 Hz.

==Technique==
===Two-mallet style===

The two-mallet approach to vibes is traditionally linear, playing like a horn rather than comping like a guitar or piano. Two-mallet players usually concentrate on playing a single melodic line and rely on other musicians to provide accompaniment. Double stops (two notes played simultaneously) are sometimes used, but mostly as a reinforcement of the main melodic line, similar to the use of double stops in solo violin music. In jazz groups, two-mallet vibraphonists are usually considered part of the &quot;front line&quot; with the horn players, contributing solos of their own but contributing very little in the way of accompaniment to other soloists.

Two-mallet players use several different grips, the most common being a matched grip called German grip, in which the mallets are played palms down, with the thumbs facing each other. In this grip, the mallets are held between the thumb and index finger of each hand, with the remaining three fingers of each hand supporting the shafts. This grip uses a combination of wrist movement and fingertip control to manipulate the mallet. Another popular grip is French grip, a grip also commonly used on timpani. The mallets are again held between the thumb and index fingers and controlled with the remaining three fingers, but the palms are held vertically, with the thumbs pointed upward. Most of the stroke action comes from the fingertip control of the shafts, with the wrists contributing slightly less than they do with the German grip.Passages are usually played with alternating sticking, but double strokes (playing two notes in a row with the same hand) are used when convenient to minimize crossing the hands.

The player must pay close attention to the damper pedal to avoid multiple notes ringing unintentionally at the same time. Because the notes ring for a considerable fraction of a second when struck with the damper pad up, and ringing bars do not stop ringing immediately when contacted by the pad, players use a technique called &quot;after pedaling&quot;. In this technique, the player presses the damper pedal slightly after striking the bar—shortly enough after so the recently struck note continues to ring, but long enough after so that the previous note stops ringing.

In another damper technique—&quot;half pedaling&quot;—the player depresses the pedal just enough to remove the spring pressure from the bars, but not enough to make the pad lose contact with the bars. This lets the bars ring slightly longer than with the pad fully up and can make a medium-fast passage sound more legato without pedaling every note.

===Four-mallet style===
The four-mallet vibraphone style is multi-linear, like a piano. In jazz groups, four-mallet vibraphonists are often considered part of the rhythm section, typically substituting for piano or guitar and providing accompaniment for other soloists in addition to soloing themselves. Furthermore, the four-mallet style has led to a significant body of unaccompanied solo vibes playing. One notable example is Gary Burton’s performance of &quot;Chega de Saudade (No More Blues)&quot; from his Grammy-winning 1971 album, &quot;Alone at Last&quot;.

The most popular four-mallet grip for vibraphone is the Burton grip, named for Gary Burton. One mallet is held between the thumb and index finger and the other is held between the index and middle fingers. The shafts cross in the middle of the palm and extend past the heel of the hand. For wide intervals, the thumb often moves in between the two mallets, and the inside mallet is held in the crook of the fingers. Unlike many other grips, the outer right mallet is the leading mallet rather than the inside two. Although some early vibes players made use of four mallets, notably Red Norvo, Adrian Rollini, and sometimes Lionel Hampton, the fully pianistic four-mallet approach to jazz on the vibraphone is almost entirely the creation of Burton.

Practitioners of Burton grip tend to make more use of double strokes as compared to two-mallet players. This is done not only to avoid crossing the hands, but also to help minimize the motions between the two bar rows. For example, an ascending E major scale could be played by keeping the left hand on the upper bars and the right hand on the lower. For linear passages with leaps, all four mallets are often used sequentially.

Also popular is the Stevens grip, named for marimbist Leigh Howard Stevens. Many other grips are in use, some variations on the Burton or Stevens, others idiosyncratic creations of individual vibes players.

==== Damping ====
Pedaling techniques are at least as important for the four-mallet vibraphonist as for two-mallet players, but the all-or-nothing damping system of the sustain pedal presents many obstacles to multi-linear playing, since each line normally has its own damping requirements independent of the other lines. To overcome this, four-mallet players also use &quot;mallet damping&quot; and &quot;hand damping&quot;. There are many benefits of being proficient in these techniques, as it allows the player to transition between chords much more smoothly and play new notes without having them affect the quality of the chord when the pedal is down.

The most common form of mallet damping occurs when the vibraphonist plays a note with one mallet before pressing another mallet into the ringing bar to stop it from sounding. Usually the damping mallet and the original striking mallet are held in different hands, but advanced players can, in some circumstances, use the same hand. Mallet damping also includes &quot;dead strokes&quot;, where a player strikes a bar and then, instead of drawing the mallet back, directly presses the head of the mallet onto the bar, causing the ringing to stop immediately. This produces a fairly distinctive &quot;choked&quot; sound, and dead strokes are often used just for that particular sound in addition to the damping aspects.

Hand damping (also known as &quot;finger damping&quot;) can be used to damp a note on the lower bars while striking a nearby upper bar. As the player strikes the upper bar with a mallet, they simultaneously press the heel of their hand or the side of their finger into the ringing lower bar, using the same hand to strike the upper bar and damp the lower one. Using both hands, it&#x27;s possible to damp and strike two bars at once.

===Extended techniques===
==== Five to six mallets ====
To achieve a denser sound and richer chord voicings, some vibraphonists have experimented with three mallets per hand, either in both hands for a total of six mallets or in just the left hand for a total of five.

==== Bowing ====

Like many other metallophones, percussionists can use an orchestral bow on the vibraphone to achieve sustained tones that will not decay, nor have a percussive attack. This is done by bowing the bars perpendicular to their outer edges. Due to the different mode of vibration, this also changes the sound of the vibraphone by emphasizing the higher harmonics and giving it a more &quot;glassy&quot; tone. Because changing notes requires large and precise movements, fast passages are not often written for bowed vibraphone.

==== Pitch bend ====
Bent notes can be achieved on the vibraphone by sliding a rubber or plastic mallet from the nodal point to the center of the bar. This technique is able to lower the pitch by about a half step.

== Repertoire ==

=== Classical ===
As part of the standard percussion section, the use of the vibraphone in classical music has increased over the past fifty years, especially within the collegiate percussion ensemble.

==== Concertos ====
Several concertos have been written for the vibraphone, the first of these being Darius Milhaud&#x27;s Concerto for Marimba, Vibraphone and Orchestra written in 1947. Other prominent concertos for the vibraphone include Ney Rosauro&#x27;s Concerto No. 1 for Vibraphone written in 1996 and Emmanuel Séjourné&#x27;s Concerto for Vibraphone and Strings written in 1999.

==== Solos ====
The vibraphone is the second most popular solo keyboard percussion instrument, after the marimba. Solos may be jazz standards specifically arranged for the instrument or newly composed pieces that are either jazz-oriented or classical in nature. Some of the most performed solo literature includes &quot;Mirror from Another&quot; by David Friedman, &quot;Mourning Dove Sonnet&quot; by Christopher Deane, &quot;Trilogy&quot; by Tim Huesgen, and &quot;Blues for Gilbert&quot; by Mark Glentworth.

==Manufacturers==

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, each manufacturer attracted its own following in various specialties, but the Deagan vibraphones were the models preferred by many of the specialist jazz players. Deagan struck endorsement deals with many of the leading players, including Lionel Hampton and Milt Jackson. However, the Deagan company went out of business in the 1980s, and its trademark and patents were purchased by Yamaha. Yamaha continues to make percussion instruments based on the Deagan designs.

In 1948, the Musser Mallet Company was founded by Clair Omar Musser, who had been a designer at Deagan. The Musser Mallet Company continues to manufacture vibraphones as part of the Ludwig Drum Company after their purchase in 1965. The Leedy Manufacturing Company, the original designers of the vibraphone, had already merged with Ludwig Drums in 1929 under C. G. Conn.

<doc id="52873" wikidata="Q626035" url="?curid=52873" title="Glockenspiel">
<text>The glockenspiel ( ; or , : bells and : play) or bells is a percussion instrument consisting of pitched aluminum or steel bars arranged in a keyboard layout. This makes the glockenspiel a type of metallophone, similar to the vibraphone. 

The glockenspiel is played by striking the bars with mallets, often made of a hard material such as metal or plastic. Its clear, high-pitched tone is often heard in orchestras, wind ensembles, marching bands, and in popular music.

==Terminology==
In German, a carillon is also called a , and in French, the glockenspiel is sometimes called a . It may also be called a () in French, although this term may sometimes be specifically reserved for the keyboard glockenspiel. In Italian, the term () is used.

The glockenspiel is sometimes erroneously referred to as a xylophone. (The xylophone has wooden bars, unlike the glockenspiel which has metal bars.) The Pixiphone, a type of toy glockenspiel, was one such instrument sold as a xylophone.

==Range==
The glockenspiel is limited to the upper register and typically covers between and 3 octaves, though certain professional models may reach up to octaves. The glockenspiel is often a transposing instrument and sounds two octaves above the written pitch, though this is sometimes remedied by using an octave clef.

==History==
Early glockenspiels were percussion instruments that produced notes via small bronze bells that were tuned with a drumstick. The bells were replaced by metal sound plates in the 17th century. In the 18th century the instrument was played using a keyboard that struck the bottom of each plate with a hammer. The use of mallets evolved during the 19th century, coinciding with Romanticism.

==Construction==
When used in a marching or military band, the bars are sometimes mounted in a portable case and held vertically, sometimes in a lyre-shaped frame. However, the bars may be held horizontally, using a harness similar to that found on a marching snare. In orchestral use, the bars are mounted horizontally.

Larger sets of glockenspiel (i.e., sets three octaves or larger) are often equipped with a sustain pedal, not unlike that of a vibraphone.

From 1918 to 1932, J.C. Deagan, Inc. manufactured bells equipped with a resonator under the name Parsifal bells. Both Adams and Yamaha model their professional-grade glockenspiels on the Deagan design.

==Mallets==
The glockenspiel is played with unwrapped mallets made of hard material, such as metal (usually brass or aluminum) or a type of polymer (usually Lexan, acrylic, phenolic, or nylon). Non-metal mallets are used for general playing, while metal mallets produce a more brilliant sound. Rubber mallets may be used for a warmer sound, although rubber that is too soft may struggle to excite the metal bars. Playing chords on a glockenspiel can be done with four mallets using a grip such as Stevens technique.

==Bell-lyre==
In the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, a form of glockenspiel is called a bell lyre, bell lyra, or lyra-glockenspiel. The bell lyre is a form of glockenspiel commonly used in marching bands. 

One variation is played vertically and has an extendable spike that is held on a strap. The player marches with the strap over one&#x27;s shoulder and plays the instrument upright with a mallet. Another variation of the bell lyre exists that is supported by a strap around the shoulders and back. This variation is played horizontally with two mallets. Since the middle of the 19th century this form has been used in military and civil bands in Germany, where it is called a &quot;Stahlspiel&quot; or &quot;Militär-Glockenspiel&quot;. 

The all-percussion drum and lyre corps in the Philippines uses this as a main instrument. This form of glockenspiel is also popular in Colombian marching band music.

Many marching bands stopped using bell lyres with the introduction of the front ensemble. One of the few college marching bands with a glockenspiel section is UC Berkeley&#x27;s University of California Marching Band, where they are affectionately referred to as &quot;glocks&quot;.

<doc id="52874" wikidata="Q216565" url="?curid=52874" title="People of the Book">
<text>People of the Book, or Ahl al-Kitāb (), is a classification in Islam for the adherents of those religions that are regarded by Muslims as having received a divine revelation from Allah, generally in the form of a holy scripture. The classification chiefly refers to pre-Islamic Abrahamic religions. In the Quran, they are identified as the Jews, the Christians, the Sabians, and—according to some interpretations—the Zoroastrians. Beginning in the 8th century, this recognition was extended to other groups, such as the Samaritans (who are closely related to the Jews), and, controversially, Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs, among others. In most applications, &quot;People of the Book&quot; is simply used by Muslims to refer to the followers of Judaism and Christianity, with which Islam shares many values, guidelines, and principles.

Historically, in countries and regions following Islamic law, the religious communities that were recognized by Muslims as People of the Book were subject to a legal status known as &quot;dhimmi&quot;, meaning that they had the option to pay a special head tax called &quot;jizya&quot; in exchange for being granted the privilege to practice their faith and govern their community according to the rules and norms of their own religion. &quot;Jizya&quot; was levied on all mentally and physically capable adult males from these recognized non-Muslim communities. Practitioners of non-recognized religions were not always granted this privilege, although many later Islamic states, particularly those in the Indian subcontinent, amended their laws to extend the application of &quot;dhimmi&quot; status beyond the originally designated Jewish and Christian communities.

In the Quran, the term is used in a variety of contexts, from religious polemics to passages emphasizing the community of faith among those who possess scriptures espousing monotheism, as opposed to polytheism or any other form of belief.

The designation of People of the Book is also relevant to Islamic marriages: a Muslim man is only permitted to marry a non-Muslim woman if she is Jewish or Christian, and he must additionally ensure that any children produced with his Jewish or Christian wife/wives are raised in the Muslim faith. Muslim women are not permitted to marry non-Muslim men, even if they are Jewish or Christian. In the case of a Muslim–Christian marriage, which is to be contracted only after permission from the Christian party, the &quot;Ashtiname&quot; of Muhammad dictates that the Muslim husband is not allowed to prevent his Christian wife from attending church for prayer and worship. 

More recently, the term has been reappropriated by Jews and by certain Christian denominations as a means of self-identification vis-à-vis Muslims.

== In the Quran ==
=== Meaning of the term ===
When used in conjunction with a person, the term identifies the members of that person&#x27;s household, including their fellow tribesmen, relatives and all those who share a family background with them. However, it may also be used with place names to refer to people living in a certain locality (e.g., in Quran 9:101, &#x27;the people of Medina&#x27;), or with more abstract nouns, as in , &#x27;the people of a certain or school of thought&#x27;.

The word , meaning &#x27;writing&#x27; or &#x27;book&#x27;, occurs very often in the Quran, generally in the sense of a divine rather than a human activity, which consists in writing down and recording everything that is created. More than just referring to a &#x27;book&#x27;, it conveys meanings of divine knowledge, divine authority, and divine revelation.

The term , then, refers to those who have been given access to such knowledge and revelation: they are the people to whom God has &#x27;sent down&#x27; (see ) his wisdom by means of a prophet, as an act of divine grace. However, the revelations given to the People of the Book, taking the form of the Torah (), the Psalms (), and the Gospel (), were all partial, and it is precisely by already being familiar with the books () previously sent down that the People of the Book were expected to be able to recognize Muhammad as a prophet, and the Quran as the final and most complete revelation.

=== Identity ===

Several verses in the Quran are commonly understood as identifying the Jews, the Christians, and the Sabians as People of the Book. Thus for example  5:68–69, which mentions these groups along with the Muslims (&quot;the believers&quot;) as being safe from fear and grief:

 2:62 is similar to this, but there is also a verse ( 22:17) which lists the same groups in another context, that of how God will judge them on the Day of Resurrection, but now adding two more groups to the list:

The last named group, &quot;the polytheists&quot; (the , ), are the opposite of the first named, &quot;the believers&quot; (the Muslims). What is less clear, however, is the status of the groups mentioned in between, who now also include the &quot;Magi&quot; (), that is to say, the Zoroastrians (who are named only once in the Quran, in this verse). This was a matter of dispute among medieval Muslim scholars, who questioned whether the Zoroastrians had a clear prophet and scripture, as well as whether their doctrines on the nature of God and creation were in accordance with those of Islam and the other religions recognized as having received a revelation. Ultimately though, most Islamic jurists granted the Zoroastrians partial status as a People of the Book, while still disagreeing on the extent to which legal privileges such as intermarriage with Muslims should be allowed.

=== Usage ===

The Quran emphasizes the community of faith between possessors of monotheistic scriptures, and occasionally pays tribute to the religious and moral virtues of communities that have received earlier revelations, calling on Muhammad to ask them for information. More often, reflecting the refusal of Jews and Christians in Muhammad&#x27;s environment to accept his message, the Quran stresses their inability to comprehend the message they possess but do not put into practice and to appreciate that Muhammad&#x27;s teaching fulfills that message.

The People of the Book are mentioned several times in the 98th chapter of the Quran, (&#x27;The Clear Proof&#x27;):

According to Islamic studies scholar Yvonne Haddad, this short chapter condemns all those who reject the &#x27;clear proof&#x27; () of the Prophet to the eternal fire of hell, whether they are People of the Book or disbelievers ().

The People of the Book are also referenced in the &quot;jizya&quot; verse (Q9:29), which has received varied interpretations.

The Quran permits marriage between Muslim men and women who are People of the Book (Jews and Christians).

==History==
=== Muhammad&#x27;s era (610–632) ===

The Ashtiname of Muhammad, a treaty purportedly made between Muhammad and the Christians of Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, stated that if a Muslim man wished to marry a Christian woman, marriage could only occur with her consent and she must be permitted to continue attending church to pray and worship. The Ashtiname states that Christians cannot be forced to fight in wars and that Muslims should fight on their behalf; it also states that Christian churches are to be respected and forbids stealing from them. The Ashtiname forbids Muslims to remove Christians from their jobs, including those who serve as judges or monks. Muslims are bound until the Last Judgment to adhere to the treaty or &quot;he would spoil God&#x27;s covenant and disobey His Prophet.&quot; The policy of the Ottoman Sultans abided by the Ashtiname.

=== Rashidun Caliphate (634–661) ===
During the second caliph Umar&#x27;s reign (), the Christian community of Najran and the Jewish community of Khaybar were deported to the newly conquered regions of Syria and Iraq. Umar set aside the Christian ban on the Jews and allowed them to pray and reside in Jerusalem. Umar signed a pact with the Christians of Jerusalem, which granted them safety in the region. He also awarded the status of the People of the Book to the Zoroastrians, although some practices contrary to Islam were prohibited.

At the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia in , the leader of the Mandaeans (one of the religious groups who historically claimed to be the Sabians mentioned in the Quran), Anush bar Danqa, is said to have traveled to Baghdad in order to appear before the Muslim authorities, showing them a copy of the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot; (the Mandaean holy book), and proclaiming the chief Mandaean prophet to be John the Baptist (known to Muslims as Yahya ibn Zakariyya). Consequently, the Muslim authorities afforded them the status of People of the Book. However, this account is likely apocryphal, and if it took place at all, it must have occurred after the founding of Baghdad in 762. The earliest source to unambiguously apply the term &#x27;Sabian&#x27; to the Mandaeans was al-Hasan ibn Bahlul () citing the Abbasid vizier Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Muqla (–940). However, it is not clear whether the Mandaeans of this period already identified themselves as Sabians or whether the claim originated with Ibn Muqla.

===Later Islamic usage===

When the Umayyad general Muhammad ibn Qasim (–715) conquered Brahmanabad, he is said to have granted Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains the status of People of the Book.

Islamic scholars differ on whether Hindus are People of the Book. The Islamic conquest of India necessitated the definition be revised, as most India&#x27;s inhabitants were followers of the Indian religions. Many of the Muslim clergy of India considered Hindus as people of the book, and from Muhammad bin Qasim in the Umayyad era to the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb in the 17th century, Muslim rulers were willing to consider Hindus as People of the Book.

===Dhimmi===

&quot;Dhimmi&quot; is a historical term referring to the status accorded to People of the Book living in an Islamic state. The word literally means &quot;protected person.&quot; According to scholars, dhimmis had their rights fully protected in their communities, but as citizens in the Islamic state, had certain restrictions, and it was obligatory for them to pay the jizya tax, which complemented the zakat, or alms, paid by the Muslim subjects. Dhimmis were excluded from specific duties assigned to Muslims, and did not enjoy certain political rights reserved for Muslims, but were otherwise equal under the laws of property, contract, and obligation.

Under sharia, the dhimmi communities were usually subjected to their own special laws, rather than some of the laws which were applicable only to the Muslim community. For example, the Jewish community in Medina was allowed to have its own Halakhic courts, and the Ottoman millet system allowed its various dhimmi communities to rule themselves under separate legal courts. These courts did not cover cases that involved religious groups outside of their own community, or capital offences. Dhimmi communities were also allowed to engage in certain practices that were usually forbidden for the Muslim community, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork.

Historically, dhimmi status was originally applied to Jews, Christians, and Sabians. This status later also came to be applied to Zoroastrians, Hindus, Jains and Buddhists. Moderate Muslims generally reject the dhimma system as inappropriate for the age of nation-states and democracies.

==Usage by Jews and Christians==
In Judaism, the term &quot;People of the Book&quot; (Hebrew: עם הספר, &quot;Am HaSefer&quot;) has been reappropriated as a term to designate the Jewish people, in reference to the Torah or to the entire Hebrew Bible. Members of some Christian denominations have also embraced the term &quot;People of the Book&quot; in reference to themselves, foremost among them the Puritans as well as the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Baptists.

<doc id="52875" wikidata="Q320341" url="?curid=52875" title="Celesta">
<text>The celesta () or celeste (), also called a bell-piano, is a struck idiophone operated by a keyboard. It looks similar to an upright piano (four- or five-octave), albeit with smaller keys and a much smaller cabinet, or a large wooden music box (three-octave). The keys connect to hammers that strike a graduated set of metal (usually steel) plates or bars suspended over wooden resonators. Four- or five-octave models usually have a damper pedal that sustains or damps the sound. The three-octave instruments do not have a pedal because of their small &quot;table-top&quot; design. One of the best-known works that uses the celesta is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky″s &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.

The sound of the celesta is similar to that of the glockenspiel, but with a much softer and more subtle timbre. This quality gave the instrument its name, &quot;celeste&quot;, meaning &quot;heavenly&quot; in French. The celesta is often used to enhance a melody line played by another instrument or section. Its musical parts are often the duplicate of a theme played on flute, harp or piano; sometimes even a real solo part. It is also used in chamber music, but there are very few concertos written for it. The delicate, bell-like sound is not loud enough to be used in full ensemble sections.

The celesta is a transposing instrument; it sounds one octave higher than the written pitch. Instruments of different sizes exist with ranges of three to five and a half octaves. Its four-octave sounding range is generally considered to be C4 to C8. The fundamental frequency of 4186 Hz makes this one of the highest pitches in common use. The original French instrument had a five-octave range, but because the lowest octave was considered somewhat unsatisfactory, it was omitted from later models before eventually being added back when technology improved. The standard French four-octave instrument is gradually being replaced in symphony orchestras by a larger, five-octave German model. Although it is a member of the percussion family, in orchestral terms it is more properly considered a member of the keyboard section and usually played by a keyboardist. The celesta part is normally written on two braced staves, called a grand staff.

== History ==

The celesta was invented in 1886 by the Parisian harmonium builder . His father, Charles Victor Mustel, had developed the forerunner of the celesta, the typophone, in 1860. This instrument produced sound by striking tuning forks instead of the metal plates that would be used in the celesta. The dulcitone functioned identically to the typophone and was developed concurrently in Scotland; it is unclear whether their creators were aware of one another&#x27;s instrument. The typophone&#x27;s and dulcitone&#x27;s uses were limited by its low volume, too quiet to be heard in a full orchestra.
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is usually cited as the first major composer to use this instrument in a work for full symphony orchestra. He first used it in his symphonic poem &quot;The Voyevoda&quot;, Op. posth. 78, premiered in November 1891. The following year, he used the celesta in passages of his ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; (Op. 71, 1892), most notably in the &quot;Variation de la Fée Dragée&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy&quot;), in response to instructions from the Balletmaster Marius Petipa that the music should resemble &quot;...drops of water shooting out of fountains...&quot;.

However, Ernest Chausson preceded Tchaikovsky by employing the celesta in December 1888 in his incidental music, written for a small orchestra, for &quot;La tempête&quot; (a French translation by Maurice Bouchor of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;).

The celesta is also notably used in Gustav Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 6, particularly in the 1st, 2nd and 4th movements, in his Symphony No. 8 and &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;. Karol Szymanowski featured it in his Symphony No. 3. Gustav Holst employed the instrument in his 1918 orchestral work &quot;The Planets&quot;, particularly in the final movement, &quot;Neptune, the Mystic&quot;. It also features prominently in Béla Bartók&#x27;s 1936 &quot;Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta&quot;. Ottorino Respighi included it in a number of his works, particularly the &quot;Roman triptych&quot; of tone poems. George Gershwin included a celesta solo in the score to &quot;An American in Paris&quot;. Ferde Grofe also wrote an extended cadenza for the instrument in the third movement of his &quot;Grand Canyon Suite&quot;. Dmitri Shostakovich included parts for celesta in seven out of his fifteen symphonies, with a notable use in the fourth symphony&#x27;s coda. Erich Wolfgang Korngold featured it in many of his works, from Marietta&#x27;s lied in act 1 of his opera Die tote Stadt, through his film career, to his Violin Concerto (particularly in the second movement), and beyond.

Twentieth-century American composer Morton Feldman used the celesta in many of his large-scale chamber pieces such as &quot;Crippled Symmetry&quot; and &quot;For Philip Guston&quot;, and it figured in much of his orchestral music and other pieces. In some works, such as &quot;Five Pianos&quot; one of the players doubles on celesta.

The celesta is used in Carl Orff&#x27;s cantata &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; (1936), and in some 20th-century operas such as the Silver Rose scene in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; (1911).

The keyboard glockenspiel part in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; is nowadays often played by a celesta.

== Use in other musical genres ==
=== Jazz ===
Since Earl Hines took it up in 1928, other jazz pianists have occasionally used the celesta as an alternative instrument. In the 1930s, Fats Waller sometimes played celesta with his right hand and piano simultaneously with his left hand. Other notable jazz pianists who occasionally played the celesta include Memphis Slim, Meade &quot;Lux&quot; Lewis, Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith, Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Buddy Greco, Oscar Peterson, McCoy Tyner, Sun Ra, Keith Jarrett, and Herbie Hancock. A celesta provides the introduction to &quot;Someday You&#x27;ll Be Sorry&quot;, a song Louis Armstrong recorded for RCA, and is featured prominently throughout the piece. A celesta is used by the pianist Russ Freeman on tracks from Chet Baker Sings (such as &quot;My Ideal&quot; and &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes)&quot;). A number of recordings Frank Sinatra made for Columbia in the 1940s feature the instrument (for instance &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot;), as do many of his albums recorded for Capitol in the 1950s (&quot;In the Wee Small Hours&quot;, &quot;Close to You&quot; and &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Lovers&quot;).

The use of celesta in jazz rapidly declined with the advent of the vibraphone.

Icelandic band Sigur Rós included celesta on their album &quot;Takk...&quot;, as did lead singer Jónsi on &quot;Go Quiet&quot;, the acoustic version of his solo album &quot;Go&quot;. Steven Wilson also uses it on various tracks in his solo works.

The Italian 1970s progressive rock band Celeste was named after the instrument.

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band used a celesta heavily in their early days, with Danny Federici often playing a Jenco Celestette in the band&#x27;s live performances throughout the 1970s and 80s.

Sheryl Crow plays celesta on her 2017 album, &quot;Be Myself&quot;.

The band A-ha used, among other instruments, a Jenco celesta during their MTV Unplugged: Summer Solstice performances, recorded and released in 2017.

=== Soundtrack ===
The celesta has been common in cinema for decades. In addition to supplementing numerous soundtrack orchestrations for films from the 1930s through to the 1960s, the celesta has occasionally been spotlighted to invoke a whimsical air. For example, in &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940), a small motif on the celesta is used whenever the Blue Fairy appears out of thin air or performs magic. Celesta also provides the signature opening of &quot;Pure Imagination&quot;, a song (sung by Gene Wilder) from the 1971 film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;. Composer John Williams&#x27;s scores for the first three Harry Potter films feature the instrument, particularly in the first two films&#x27; frequent statements of &quot;Hedwig&#x27;s Theme&quot;.

Another notable use of the celesta was in the music on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. It was most famously heard in the intro to the theme song of the programme, &quot;Won&#x27;t You Be My Neighbor&quot;, which began with a dreamy sequence on the instrument. The song was sung by Fred Rogers and played by Johnny Costa. It was also used from time to time in other music sequences throughout the programme, such as the one heard as the Neighborhood Trolley moved in and out of the Neighborhood of Make Believe.

A celesta is used in the full orchestral version of the theme song from the TV series&quot; The West Wing&quot;, composed by W. G. Snuffy Walden.

== Manufacturers ==
Schiedmayer and Yamaha are the only companies currently making celestas. Other known manufacturers that made celestas in the past include:
* Mustel &amp; Company (Paris, France) 
* Simone Bros. Celeste MFGS (Philadelphia and New York, US)
* Morley (England)
* Jenco (Decatur, Illinois, US)
* Helmes (New York, US)

== Substitutes ==
If an ensemble or orchestra lacks a celesta, a piano, synthesizer, or sampler and electronic keyboards are often used as a substitute.

* Electric piano
* Voix céleste on organs

<doc id="52881" wikidata="Q192948" url="?curid=52881" title="Gerard Kuiper">
<text>Gerard Peter Kuiper ( ; born Gerrit Pieter Kuiper, ; 7 December 1905 – 23 December 1973) was a Dutch-American astronomer, planetary scientist, selenographer, author and professor. The Kuiper belt is named after him.

Kuiper is considered by many to be the father of modern planetary science.

==Early life and education==
Kuiper, the son of a tailor in the village of Tuitjenhorn in North Holland, had an early interest in astronomy. He had extraordinarily sharp eyesight, allowing him to see with the naked eye magnitude 7.5 stars, about four times fainter than those visible to normal eyes.

He studied at Leiden University in 1924, where at the time a very large number of astronomers had congregated. He befriended fellow students Bart Bok and Pieter Oosterhoff, and was taught by Ejnar Hertzsprung, Antonie Pannekoek, Willem de Sitter, Jan Woltjer, Jan Oort, and the physicist Paul Ehrenfest. He received his candidate degree in Astronomy in 1927 and continued straight on with his graduate studies.

Kuiper received his PhD degree from Leiden University in the Netherlands on his thesis on binary stars with Hertzsprung in 1933.

==Career==
He traveled to California to become a fellow under Robert Grant Aitken at the Lick Observatory. In 1935 he left to work at the Harvard College Observatory, where he met Sarah Parker Fuller (1913-2000), whom he married on 20 June 1936. Although he had planned to move to Java to work at the Bosscha Observatory, he took a position at Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago and received American citizenship in 1937.

From 1947 to 1949, Kuiper served as the director of the McDonald Observatory in west Texas. 
In 1949, Kuiper initiated the Yerkes–McDonald asteroid survey (1950–1952).

From 1950-1960 he was professor at the University of Chicago, directing the Yerkes Observatory. He was doctoral advisor to Carl Sagan. In 1958, the two worked on the classified military Project A119, a secret Air Force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the moon.
In 1959, he sent Jürgen Stock to Chile, to search for suitable sites of an observatory for the Southern skies, who eventually would identify the spot for the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.

In 1960 Kuiper moved to Tucson, Arizona, to found the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, serving as the laboratory&#x27;s director for the rest of his life, until his death in 1973. 

===Discoveries===
Kuiper discovered two natural satellites of planets in the Solar System, namely Uranus&#x27;s satellite Miranda and Neptune&#x27;s satellite Nereid. In addition, he discovered carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Mars, and the existence of a methane-laced atmosphere above Saturn&#x27;s satellite Titan in 1944. Kuiper also pioneered airborne infrared observing using a Convair 990 aircraft in the 1960s.

In the 1950s Kuiper&#x27;s interdisciplinary collaboration with the geochemist and Nobel Laureate Harold C. Urey to understand the Moon&#x27;s thermal evolution descended into acrimony, as the two engaged in what became known as the &quot;Hot Moon, Cold Moon&quot; controversy. Their falling out, in part a scientific dispute, also reflected the challenge of maintaining professional relationships across overlapping but distinct scientific disciplines.

In 1951, in a paper in &quot;Astrophysics: A Topical Symposium&quot;, Kuiper speculated that a large disc of small astronomical bodies formed early in the Solar System&#x27;s evolution. He suggested that the disc consisted of &quot;remnants of original clusterings which have lost many members that became stray asteroids, much as has occurred with open galactic clusters dissolving into stars.&quot; In another paper, based upon a lecture Kuiper gave in 1950, also called &quot;On the Origin of the Solar System&quot;, Kuiper wrote about the &quot;outermost region of the solar nebula, from 38 to 50 astr. units (i.e., just outside proto-Neptune)&quot; where &quot;condensation products (ices of H20, NH3, CH4, etc.) must have formed, and the flakes must have slowly collected and formed larger aggregates, estimated to range up to 1 km or more in size.&quot; He continued to write that &quot;these condensations appear to account for the comets, in size, number and composition.&quot; According to Kuiper &quot;the planet Pluto, which sweeps through the whole zone from 30 to 50 astr. units, is held responsible for having started the scattering of the comets throughout the solar system.&quot; It is said that Kuiper was operating on the assumption, common in his time, that Pluto was the size of Earth and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System; there would not be a Kuiper belt today if this were correct. The name &quot;Kuiper belt&quot; was given to the region in the 1980s; it was first used in print by Scott Tremaine in 1988.

In the 1960s, Kuiper helped identify landing sites on the Moon for the Apollo program.

Kuiper discovered several binary stars which received &quot;Kuiper numbers&quot; to identify them, such as KUI 79.

== Personal life and death ==
He married Sarah Parker Fuller (1913-2000) on 20 June 1936. Kuiper died age 68 of a heart attack on 23 December 1973 in Mexico City, while on vacation with his wife.

==Honors==
* In 1947, Kuiper was awarded the Prix Jules Janssen of the Société astronomique de France (Astronomical Society of France).
* In 1959, Kuiper won the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship of the American Astronomical Society.
*In 1971, Kuiper received the Kepler Gold Medal from the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Franklin Institute.

Besides the minor planet 1776 Kuiper, three craters (Mercurian, lunar, and Martian), Kuiper Scarp in Antarctica, and the now-decommissioned Kuiper Airborne Observatory were also named after him.

Astronomers refer to a region of minor planets beyond Neptune as the &quot;Kuiper belt&quot;, since Kuiper had suggested that such small planets or comets may have formed there. However Kuiper himself believed that such objects would have been swept clear by planetary gravitational perturbations, so that none or few would exist there today.

The Kuiper Prize, named in his honor, is the most distinguished award given by the American Astronomical Society&#x27;s Division for Planetary Sciences, an international society of professional planetary scientists.

One of the three buildings at Arizona that makes up the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory is named in his honor.

==In popular culture==
Episode 6 (&quot;The Man of a Trillion Worlds&quot;) of the TV series &quot;&quot; featured the Kuiper–Urey conflict.

<doc id="52883" wikidata="Q507542" url="?curid=52883" title="Lavon Affair">
<text>The Lavon affair was a failed Israeli covert operation, codenamed Operation Susannah, conducted in Egypt in the summer of 1954. As part of a false flag operation, a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence to plant bombs inside Egyptian-, American-, and British-owned civilian targets: cinemas, libraries, and American educational centers. The bombs were timed to detonate several hours after closing time. The attacks were to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian communists, &quot;unspecified malcontents&quot;, or &quot;local nationalists&quot; with the aim of creating a climate of sufficient violence and instability to induce the British government to retain its occupying troops in Egypt&#x27;s Suez Canal zone. The operation caused no casualties among the population, but resulted in the deaths of four operatives. The overseer of the operation allegedly informed the Egyptians, after which 11 suspected operatives were arrested. Two died by suicide after being captured, two were executed by the Egyptian authorities, two of them were acquitted at trial, and the remaining five received prison terms ranging from 7 years to life in prison.

The operation ultimately became known as the &quot;Lavon affair&quot; after the Israeli defense minister Pinhas Lavon, who was forced to resign as a consequence of the incident. Before Lavon&#x27;s resignation, the incident had been euphemistically referred to in Israel as the &quot;Unfortunate Affair&quot; or &quot;The Bad Business&quot; (, &quot;HaEsek HaBish&quot;). Israel publicly denied any involvement in the incident until 2005, when the surviving agents were awarded certificates of appreciation by Israeli President Moshe Katsav.

==Operation Susannah==

===Aim===
In the early 1950s, the United States initiated a more activist policy of support for Egyptian nationalism; this aim was often in contrast with Britain&#x27;s policy of maintaining its regional hegemony. Israel feared that the US policy, which encouraged Britain to withdraw its military forces from the Suez Canal, would embolden the military ambitions towards Israel of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt. Israel at first sought to influence this policy through diplomatic means, but was frustrated.

In the summer of 1954, Colonel Binyamin Gibli, the chief of Israel&#x27;s military intelligence directorate Aman, initiated &#x27;Operation Susannah&#x27; in order to reverse that decision. The goal of the Operation was to carry out bombings and other acts of sabotage in Egypt, with the aim of creating an atmosphere in which the British and American opponents of British withdrawal from Egypt would be able to gain the upper hand and block the British withdrawal from Egypt.

According to historian Shabtai Teveth, who wrote one of the more detailed accounts, the assignment was &quot;To undermine Western confidence in the existing Egyptian regime by generating public insecurity and actions to bring about arrests, demonstrations, and acts of revenge, while totally concealing the Israeli factor. The team was accordingly urged to avoid detection, so that suspicion would fall on the Muslim Brotherhood, the Communists, &#x27;unspecified malcontents&#x27; or &#x27;local nationalists&#x27;.&quot;

===Secret cell===
The top-secret cell, Unit 131, which was to carry out the operation, had existed since 1948 and under Aman since 1950. At the time of Operation Susannah, Unit 131 was the subject of a bitter dispute between Aman (military intelligence) and Mossad (national intelligence agency) over who should control it.

Unit 131 operatives had been recruited several years earlier, when the Israeli intelligence officer Avraham Dar arrived in Cairo under the cover of a British citizen from Gibraltar named John Darling. He had recruited several Egyptian Jews, known as &quot;sayanim&quot; (), who had also previously been active in helping Jews flee to Israel, activities that Egypt deemed illegal, and trained them for covert operations.

===Operation commenced===
Aman decided to activate the network in the spring of 1954. On 2 July, the cell detonated bombs at a post office in Alexandria, and on 14 July, it bombed the libraries of the U.S. Information Agency in Alexandria and Cairo, and a British-owned theater. The homemade bombs, consisting of bags containing acid placed over nitroglycerine, were inserted into books and placed on the shelves of the libraries just before closing time. Several hours later, as the acid ate through the bags, the bombs would explode. They did little damage to the targets and caused no injuries or deaths.
Before the group began the operation, Israeli agent Avri Elad (Avraham Seidenberg) was sent to oversee the operations. Elad assumed the identity of Paul Frank, a former SS officer with Nazi underground connections. Avri Elad allegedly informed the Egyptians, resulting in the Egyptian intelligence agency following a suspect to his target, the Rio Theatre, where a fire engine was standing by. Egyptian authorities arrested this suspect, Philip Natanson, when his bomb accidentally ignited prematurely in his pocket. Having searched his apartment, they found incriminating evidence and names of accomplices to the operation.

Eleven suspects were arrested, including Egyptian Jews and undercover Israelis. Elad and Colonel Dar managed to escape. Two suspects, Yosef Carmon and Israeli Meir Max Bineth, died by suicide in prison.

==Trials and jail==
The Egyptian trial began on 11 December and lasted until 27 January 1955; two of the accused (Moshe Marzouk and ) were sentenced to death by hanging, two were acquitted, and the rest received lengthy prison terms ranging from 7 years to life in prison.

In 1954, on behalf of both Winston Churchill and the World Jewish Congress, Maurice Orbach went to Cairo to intercede for the lives of those sentenced to death. Later, he said that Egypt&#x27;s president, Nasser, had agreed to spare their lives but then reneged on this, balancing their deaths with those of members of the Muslim Brotherhood.

The trial was criticised in Israel as a show trial, although strict Israeli military censorship of the press at the time meant that the Israeli public was kept in the dark about the facts of the case, and in fact were led to believe that the defendants were innocent. There were allegations that evidence had been extracted by torture.
After serving seven-year jail sentences, two of the imprisoned operatives (Meir Meyuhas and Meir Za&#x27;afran) were released in 1962. The rest were eventually freed in February 1968, including Marcelle Ninio, in a secret addendum to a prisoner-of-war exchange.

Soon after the affair, Mossad chief Isser Harel expressed suspicion to Aman concerning the integrity of Avri Elad. Despite his concerns, Aman continued using Elad for intelligence operations until 1956, when he was caught trying to sell Israeli documents to the Egyptians. Elad was tried in Israel and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. During his imprisonment in Ayalon Prison, the media were only able to refer to him as the &quot;Third Man&quot; or &quot;X&quot; due to government censorship. In 1976, while living in Los Angeles, Elad publicly identified himself as the &quot;Third Man&quot; from the Lavon Affair. In 1980, Harel publicly revealed evidence that Elad had been turned by the Egyptians even before Operation Susannah.

==Political aftermath==

===Denial and first inquiry===
In meetings with the prime minister Moshe Sharett, minister of defense Pinhas Lavon denied any knowledge of the operation. When intelligence chief Gibli contradicted Lavon, Sharett commissioned a board of inquiry consisting of Israeli Supreme Court Justice Isaac Olshan and the first chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Yaakov Dori that was unable to find conclusive evidence that Lavon had authorized the operation. Lavon tried to fix the blame on Shimon Peres, who was the secretary general of the defense ministry, and on Gibli for insubordination and criminal negligence.

Sharett resolved the dilemma by siding with Peres (who had, along with Moshe Dayan, testified against Lavon), after which Lavon resigned on 17 February 1955. Former prime minister David Ben-Gurion succeeded Lavon as minister of defense. On 3 November 1955, Sharett (who had not known about the operation in advance, and had therefore strongly denied Israel&#x27;s involvement) resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by Ben-Gurion.

===Subsequent revelations and inquiries===
In April 1960, a review of minutes from the inquiry found inconsistencies and possibly a fraudulent document in Gibli&#x27;s original testimony that seemed to support Lavon&#x27;s account of events. During this time it came to light that Elad (the Israeli agent running Operation Susannah in Egypt) had committed perjury during the original inquiry. Elad was also suspected of betraying the group to Egyptian authorities, though the charges were never proven. He was eventually sentenced to a jail term of 10 years for trying to sell Israeli documents to the Egyptians in an unrelated matter. Ben-Gurion scheduled closed hearings with a new board of inquiry chaired by Haim Cohn, a Supreme Court justice.

This inquiry found that the perjury indeed had been committed, and that Lavon had not authorized the operation. Sharett and Levi Eshkol tried to issue a statement that would placate both Lavon and those who had opposed him. Ben-Gurion refused to accept the compromise, and viewed it as a divisive play within the Mapai party.

Another investigative committee took up the matter and sided with the Cohn inquiry. Ben-Gurion then resigned from his post as defense minister. This led to the expulsion of Lavon from the Histadrut labor union and an early call for new elections, the results of which changed the political structure in Israel. The specifics of Operation Susannah were kept secret from the Israeli public at the time of the political upheaval.

===Public debate===
Due to Israel&#x27;s military censorship the details of the affair could originally not be openly discussed in the media. Despite this, debate occurred but with the use of code words such as the &quot;Senior Officer&quot;, to refer to Gibli, and the &quot;unfortunate business&quot; to refer to the Egyptian operation.

==Legacy==
Operation Susannah and the Lavon Affair turned out to be disastrous for Israel in several ways:

* Israel lost significant standing and credibility in its relations with the United Kingdom and the United States, that took years to repair.
* The aftermath saw considerable political turmoil in Israel, which affected the influence of its government.

Israel publicly honored the surviving spies on March 30, 2005; President Moshe Katsav presented each with a certificate of appreciation for their efforts on behalf of the state, ending decades of official denial by Israel.

<text>A logo (abbreviation of logotype; ) is a graphic mark, emblem, or symbol used to aid and promote public identification and recognition. It may be of an abstract or figurative design or include the text of the name that it represents, as in a wordmark.

In the days of hot metal typesetting, a logotype was one word cast as a single piece of type (e.g. &quot;The&quot; in ATF Garamond), as opposed to a ligature, which is two or more letters joined, but not forming a word. By extension, the term was also used for a uniquely set and arranged typeface or colophon. At the level of mass communication and in common usage, a company&#x27;s logo is today often synonymous with its trademark or brand.

==Etymology==
Douglas Harper&#x27;s &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; states that the first surviving written record of the term &#x27;logo&#x27; dates back to 1937, and that the term was &quot;probably a shortening of logogram&quot;.

==History==
Numerous inventions and techniques have contributed to the contemporary logo, including cylinder seals (), coins (), trans-cultural diffusion of logographic languages, coats of arms, watermarks, silver hallmarks, and the development of printing technology.

As the Industrial Revolution converted western societies from agrarian to industrial in the 18th and 19th centuries, photography and lithography contributed to the boom of an advertising industry that integrated typography and imagery together on the page. Simultaneously, typography itself was undergoing a revolution of form and expression that expanded beyond the modest, serif typefaces used in books, to bold, ornamental typefaces used on broadsheet posters.

The arts were expanding in purpose—from expression and decoration of an artistic, storytelling nature, to a differentiation of brands and products that the growing middle classes were consuming. Consultancies and trades-groups in the commercial arts were growing and organizing; by 1890, the US had 700 lithographic printing firms employing more than 8,000 people. Artistic credit tended to be assigned to the lithographic company, as opposed to the individual artists who usually performed less important jobs.
Innovators in the visual arts and lithographic process—such as French printing firm Rouchon in the 1840s, Joseph Morse of New York in the 1850s, Frederick Walker of England in the 1870s, and Jules Chéret of France in the 1870s—developed an illustrative style that went beyond tonal, representational art to figurative imagery with sections of bright, flat colors. Playful children&#x27;s books, authoritative newspapers, and conversational periodicals developed their own visual and editorial styles for unique, expanding audiences. As printing costs decreased, literacy rates increased, and visual styles changed, the Victorian decorative arts led to an expansion of typographic styles and methods of representing businesses.

The Arts and Crafts Movement of late-19th century, partially in response to the excesses of Victorian typography, aimed to restore an honest sense of craftsmanship to the mass-produced goods of the era. A renewal of interest in craftsmanship and quality also provided the artists and companies with a greater interest in credit, leading to the creation of unique logos and marks.

By the 1950s, Modernism had shed its roots as an avant-garde artistic movement in Europe to become an international, commercialized movement with adherents in the United States and elsewhere. The visual simplicity and conceptual clarity that were the hallmarks of Modernism as an artistic movement formed a powerful toolset for a new generation of graphic designers whose logos embodied Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s dictum, &quot;Less is more.&quot; Modernist-inspired logos proved successful in the era of mass visual communication ushered in by television, improvements in printing technology, and digital innovations.

==Contemporary logos==
The current era of logo design began in the 1870s with the first abstract logo, the Bass red triangle. , many corporations, products, brands, services, agencies, and other entities use an ideogram (sign, icon) or an emblem (symbol) or a combination of sign and emblem as a logo. As a result, only a few of the thousands of ideograms in circulation are recognizable without a name. An effective logo may consist of both an ideogram and the company name (logotype) to emphasize the name over the graphic, and employ a unique design via the use of letters, colors, and additional graphic elements.

Ideograms and symbols may be more effective than written names (logotypes), especially for logos translated into many alphabets in increasingly globalized markets. For instance, a name written in Arabic script might have little resonance in most European markets. By contrast, ideograms keep the general proprietary nature of a product in both markets. In non-profit areas, the Red Cross (varied as the Red Crescent in Muslim countries and as the Red Star of David in Israel) exemplifies a well-known emblem that does not need an accompanying name. The red cross and red crescent are among the best-recognized symbols in the world. National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their Federation as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross include these symbols in their logos.

Branding can aim to facilitate cross-language marketing. Consumers and potential consumers can identify the Coca-Cola name written in different alphabets because of the standard color and &quot;ribbon wave&quot; design of its logo. The text was written in Spencerian Script, which was a popular writing style when the Coca-Cola Logo was being designed.

==Logo design==

Since a logo is the visual entity signifying an organization, logo design is an important area of graphic design. A logo is the central element of a complex identification system that must be functionally extended to all communications of an organization. Therefore, the design of logos and their incorporation in a visual identity system is one of the most difficult and important areas of graphic design. Logos fall into three classifications (which can be combined). Ideographs, such as Chase Bank, are completely abstract forms; pictographs are iconic, representational designs; logotypes (or wordmarks) depict the name or company initials. These elements can be combined in a set position and relative size in a logo lock-up, so named because elements are &quot;locked&quot; together and should not be broken apart or resized individually. Because logos are meant to represent companies&#x27; brands or corporate identities and foster their immediate customer recognition, it is counterproductive to frequently redesign logos.

The logo design profession has substantially increased in numbers over the years since the rise of the Modernist movement in the United States in the 1950s. Three designers are widely considered the pioneers of that movement and of logo and corporate identity design: The first is Chermayeff &amp; Geismar, which is the firm responsible for many iconic logos, such as Chase Bank (1964), Mobil Oil (1965), PBS (1984), NBC (1986), National Geographic (2003), and others. Due to the simplicity and boldness of their designs, many of their earlier logos are still in use today. The firm recently designed logos for the Library of Congress and the fashion brand Armani Exchange. Another pioneer of corporate identity design is Paul Rand, who was one of the originators of the Swiss Style of graphic design. He designed many posters and corporate identities, including the famous logos for IBM, UPS, and ABC. The third pioneer of corporate identity design is Saul Bass. Bass was responsible for several recognizable logos in North America, including both the Bell Telephone logo (1969) and successor AT&amp;T Corporation globe (1983). Other well-known designs were Continental Airlines (1968), Dixie (1969), and United Way (1972). Later, he would produce logos for a number of Japanese companies as well.
An important development in the documentation of logo design is the study of French trademarks by historian Edith Amiot and philosopher Jean Louis Azizollah.

==Logo color==

Color is a key element in logo design and plays an important and potentially vital role in brand differentiation. Colors can have immense consequences on our moods. They are remarkably dominant to the point that they can psychologically manipulate perspectives, emotions, and reactions. The importance of color in this context is due to the mechanics of human visual perception wherein color and contrast play critical roles in visual detail detection. In addition, we tend to acquire various color connotations and color associations through social and cultural conditioning, and these play a role in how we decipher and evaluate logo color. While color is considered important to brand recognition and logo design, it should not conflict with logo functionality, and it needs to be remembered that color connotations and associations are not consistent across all social and cultural groups. For example, in the United States, red, white, and blue are often used in logos for companies that want to project patriotic feelings but other countries will have different sets of colors that evoke national pride.

Choosing an organisation&#x27;s logo color is an important decision because of its long term implications and its role in creating differentiation among competitors&#x27; logos. A methodology for identifying potential logo colors within an industry sector is color mapping, whereby existing logo colors are systematically identified, mapped, and evaluated (O&#x27;Connor, 2011).

===Logo design process===
Designing a good logo often requires involvement from a marketing team teaming with the graphic design studio. Before a logo is designed, there must be a clear definition of the concept and values of the brand as well as understanding of the consumer or target group. Broad steps in the logo design process include research, conceptualization, investigation of alternative candidates, refinement of a chosen design, testing across products, and finally adoption and production of the chosen mark.

===Dynamic logos===
In 1898, the French tire manufacturer Michelin introduced the Michelin Man, a cartoon figure presented in many different contexts, such as eating, drinking, and playing sports. By the early 21st century, large corporations such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Google, Morton Salt, and Saks Fifth Avenue had adopted &quot;dynamic logos&quot; that change over time from setting to setting.

===Internet-compatible logos===
A company that uses logotypes (wordmarks) may desire a logo that matches the firm&#x27;s Internet address. For short logotypes consisting of two or three characters, multiple companies are found to employ the same letters. A &quot;CA&quot; logo, for example, is used by the French bank Credit Agricole, the Dutch clothing retailer C&amp;A, and the US software corporation CA Technologies, but only one can have the Internet domain name CA.com.

In today&#x27;s digital interface adaptive world, a logo will be formatted and re-formatted from large monitors to small handheld devices. With the constant size change and re-formatting, logo designers are shifting to a more bold and simple approach, with heavy lines and shapes, and solid colors. This reduces the confusion when mingled with other logos in tight spaces and when scaled between media. Social networks like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+ use such logos.
==Design protection==
Logos and their design may be protected by copyright, via various intellectual property organisations worldwide which make available application procedures to register a design to give it protection at law. For example, in the UK, the Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom) govern registered designs, patents, and trademarks. Ordinarily, the trademark registration will not &#x27;make claim&#x27; to colors used, meaning it is the visual design that will be protected, even if it is reproduced in a variety of other colors or backgrounds.

In some countries, especially civil law countries, the threshold of originality required for copyright protection can be quite high, so a logo that contains simple geometric shapes or text might not be eligible for copyright protection although it can be protected as a trademark.

==Sports==
For many teams, a logo or &quot;crest&quot; is an important way to recognize a team&#x27;s history and can intimidate opponents.
For certain teams, the logo and color scheme are synonymous with the team&#x27;s players. For example, Manchester United, the Toronto Maple Leafs, or New York Yankees all have a recognizable logo that can be identified by any fan of the respective sport.

<doc id="52892" wikidata="Q32485" url="?curid=52892" title="Modern pentathlon">
<text>The modern pentathlon is an Olympic multisport that currently consists of fencing (one-touch épée), freestyle swimming, equestrian show jumping, laser pistol shooting, and cross country running. Equestrian will be replaced by a form of obstacle course racing at the 2028 Summer Olympics.

The event was first held in 1912, inspired by the traditional pentathlon held during the ancient Olympics, and designed to model skills needed by a soldier of that time. It has been a continuous part of the Summer Olympics since 1912, and a world championship has been held annually since 1949.

The rules of the modern pentathlon have changed several times, especially in the past three decades. The event has been condensed from five days to one day and further down to two hours. The latest structure, as of the 2024 Olympics, consists of separate events for fencing, swimming, and equestrian, points from which determine each athlete&#x27;s starting time in the final event, the laser-run. Egypt has achieved consistent success across multiple age-group world championships, culminating in Ahmed El-Gendy winning the first Olympic gold medal by an African pentathlete at the 2024 Summer Olympics. Hungary has won the most Olympic gold medals after Michelle Gulyas became its second women’s Olympic champion at Paris 2024.  

The initial program of the 2028 Olympics did not include modern pentathlon, but the 141st IOC Session in Mumbai, India, voted to approve the inclusion of the sport with its new format where obstacle racing replaces equestrian.

Modern pentathlon&#x27;s governing body, Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM), administers the international sport with member federations in more than 130 countries.

== Format ==
The format of the modern pentathlon has changed frequently through the sport&#x27;s history. Described below is the format that was used in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris:

* Fencing, ranking round: In the first round of the fencing, every athlete faces every other athlete in one-on-one fencing bouts. Bouts use an electric épée with the target being the whole body, and end after one hit, though if neither athlete scores a hit within one minute the bout ends with both registering a defeat. Athletes that win 70 percent of their bouts score 250 points; each win above is worth 5 more points, each below is 5 points less.
* Riding: Athletes attempt a show jumping course comprising 12 obstacles. Athletes do not bring a horse to the event; they are assigned an unfamiliar horse and have 20 minutes to practice with the animal. Completing the course scores 300 points, with points deducted for penalties and for taking longer than a set time limit for the course.
* Swimming: This is a single 200 meter freestyle swim. A time of 2 minutes 30 seconds scores 250 points; each second faster than that earns 2 points and each second slower loses 2 points.
* Fencing, bonus round: In the second round of fencing, athletes are ordered based on the first round&#x27;s results. The last-place athlete goes against the next-placed athlete. The winner receives 2 points and advances to compete against the next best-ranked athlete; the loser is eliminated from this round of fencing (for double-defeats, the winner of the bout is the athlete who was higher-ranked going into the round). This continues until all but one athlete is eliminated. (The athlete who enters this round in the top of the fencing order can only have one bout; if they won the fencing ranking round they can earn 4 points if they win that bout.)
* Laser-run: At this final event, athletes&#x27; starting times are determined by their total scores from the first three events, so that the highest scorer starts first, and each successive athlete then starts with a delay of one second for each point by which they trail the leader. Athletes run 3000 meters, stopping four times to shoot at targets with a laser pistol. In each round, they must remain at the target until they score five hits (with an unlimited number of shots) or until 50 seconds have elapsed. Final placement in the overall modern pentathlon is determined by order across the finish line.
At the 2024 Olympics, the event was run twice for each gender. The first, the semifinals, determined which athletes could participate in the finals. The finals then determines the medallists. However, the fencing ranking round was only run once and its results were used for both the semifinals and finals. 
== History ==
=== Creation ===
Most sources state that the creator of the modern pentathlon was Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games. One alternative view is provided by researcher Sandra Heck, who concluded that Viktor Balck, the President of the Organizing Committee for the 1912 Games, made use of the long tradition of Swedish military multi-sports events to create the modern pentathlon.

The name derives from the Greek &quot;péntathlon&quot; &quot;contest of five [events]&quot;. The addition of &quot;modern&quot; to the name distinguishes it from the original pentathlon of the ancient Olympic Games, which consisted of the &quot;stadion&quot; foot race, wrestling, long jump, javelin, and discus. The location of the first Olympic Games was Olympia in 708 BCE. As the events of the ancient pentathlon were modelled on the skills of the ideal soldier to defend a fortification of that time, Coubertin created the contest to simulate the experience of a 19th-century cavalry soldier behind enemy lines: he must ride an unfamiliar horse, fight enemies with pistol and sword, swim, and run to return to his own soldiers.

=== Olympic Games ===
The event was first held at the 1912 Olympic Games and has been on the Olympic program continuously ever since. It was a male-only event until the 2000 Games, when an event for women was added. This enabled the sport to achieve gender parity 24 years before the Olympic Games managed this as a whole.

A men&#x27;s team event was added to the Olympic Games in 1952, and was included in all Summer Olympics until its last appearance in 1992.

Originally, the competition took place over four or five days. In 1996, a one-day format was adopted in a major shift towards the sport&#x27;s more audience-friendly future. The switch to a one-day format was criticised for changing the steady character of modern pentathlon to a more fast-paced competition. To further enhance the experience for spectators, the UIPM proposed that all five events should be held in a single venue. This was planned for the 2016 Summer Olympics but held for the first time at the 2020 Summer Olympics. For the 2024 Summer Olympics, the format is further condensed into two hours. Further innovation and streamlining to maximise the sport&#x27;s appeal, including changes to the fencing event, is planned for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
Modern pentathlon is also part of the Youth Olympic Games since 2010.

Modern pentathlon, despite its long Olympic history, has had to justify its inclusion in the modern Olympic Games several times. On February 11, 2013, in Lausanne, the IOC confirmed modern pentathlon once again as one of the 25 core sports of the Olympic program through to 2020. Nine years later, the IOC confirmed its place on the program for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

=== Governance ===
Until 1948 there was no official international federation for modern pentathlon, so an IOC committee was set up for the sport making use of the expertise of IOC members. The governing body, Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) was founded in 1948 in Sandhurst, England during the London 1948 Olympic Games.

=== International competitions ===
A world championship has been held every year since 1949. The competitions now include men and women&#x27;s individual and team events together with relay events for men and women and, since 2010, a mixed relay event. After much lobby work of the president of the German Modern Pentathlon Federation, Wilhelm Henze, women were for the first time admitted at the world championships in 1977, and at the official world championships in 1981.

The Modern Pentathlon World Cup is an annual series of modern pentathlon competitions, with four events taking place in the regular season and the top 36 female and top 36 male athletes qualifying to compete in the World Cup Final. It was first held in 1999.

== Format changes over time ==
Modern pentathlon has been the subject of numerous changes since its creation.

=== Fencing ===
In 2015 — and for the first time in the 2016 Summer Olympics — a system of an additional bonus round was added to épée fencing in international competitions. Before that, there was only the round-robin format.

=== Swimming ===
Until the 2000 Olympics, the distance for swimming was 300 metres; at that time it was changed to 200 metres.

=== Riding ===
The distance of the cross-country riding event was reduced from 5 km to 4 km in 1972. For the 1988 Summer Olympics cross-country riding was changed to show jumping.

=== Shooting and running ===
From 1912 to 1988 regular pistols or later sport pistols were used for shooting. From 1989 until 2009, the shooting discipline involved firing a 4.5 mm (.177 cal) air pistol in the standing position from 10 metres distance at a stationary target. The format was that of the 10 metre air pistol competition: each competitor had 20 shots, with 40 seconds allowed for each shot. Beginning with the World Cup events in 2011, in a move designed to improve the safety and sustainability of the sport, laser pistols were used instead of pistols with actual projectiles. There is a slight delay between the trigger pull and the laser firing, simulating the time it would take for a pellet to clear the muzzle. Air pistols with laser transmitters were introduced during the transitional period and are still in use. Purpose-built laser pistols are developed and commonly used since the middle of the 2010s. Laser pistols and targets have to be certified by the UIPM.

Until the 2000 Olympics, the running distance was 4 kilometres. The running discipline was shortened to a 3 km cross-country run afterwards.

In 2009, the running and shooting events were combined into three 1000 m laps with each preceded by laser shooting at five targets in 70 seconds or less. From the start of the 2013 season, the laser-run was changed to consist of four 800 m laps (increasing the distance to 3.2 kilometres) each preceded by laser shooting at five targets in 50 seconds or less. This change was intended to restore some of the importance of the shooting skill felt to have been lost in the original 2009 combined event. After the 2020 Summer Olympics (postponed to 2021), the run was further modified to a new model of five 600 m laps.

The laser-run has been criticized as altering too radically the nature of the skills required. &quot;The New York Times&quot; asked whether the name ought to be changed to &quot;tetrathlon&quot; given that two of the five disciplines had been combined into a single event. Laser-run has also become a sport in its own right with para athlete participation and world championships of its own. It is the summer equivalent of the biathlon winter sport, which involves skiing and shooting.

=== Overall scoring and operation ===
Scoring was originally done by a points-for-place system with the lowest score winning. Since the 1954 World Cup points tables are used for each of the five events and points are added for the final score. This scoring was first used in the 1956 Summer Olympics. The five disciplines were held on a single day — instead of four to six — from the 1996 Summer Olympics onwards. In the 2024 Olympics, all five disciplines – other than the fencing ranking round – will all take place in the same venue within 90 minutes.

=== Replacement of riding with obstacle course racing ===
The riding discipline attracted criticism during the 2020 Summer Olympics after multiple athletes in the women&#x27;s event struggled to control their randomly-assigned horses. This culminated in the German team&#x27;s coach, Kim Raisner, being removed from the event after striking a horse with her fist. Following the Games, in November 2021 it was reported that the UIPM was opening consultations on the proposed replacement of riding with another discipline. The decision was ratified during the UIPM&#x27;s Congress on 27 November 2021, with the changes intended to be implemented for the 2028 Summer Olympics. According to critics of the decision, the UIPM voted for the change without consulting athletes, claiming &quot;force majeure&quot;.

The decision was met with criticism from various athletes and bodies, who considered riding to be integral to modern pentathlon. Some also accused the UIPM of hindering debate in favor of riding during the congress. More than 650 modern pentathletes signed a letter calling for the UIPM executive board to resign in November 2021. A group known as &quot;Pentathlon United&quot; called for the IOC to investigate the UIPM&#x27;s governance, and proposed a plan to maintain riding with rule changes to bring them in line with those of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI), and a focus on animal welfare.

In May 2022, the UIPM announced it would hold an obstacle racing test event alongside the 2022 Modern Pentathlon World Cup final in Ankara, citing that it had received the most support out of the over 60 disciplines proposed, was more cost-effective, would help make the event more attractive to a younger audience, and was &quot;compatible with the DNA of modern pentathlon&quot;. The competition course was developed with input from World Obstacle and Japanese broadcaster TBS (producer of the sports competition series &quot;Sasuke&quot;, whose format has been widely exported under the title &quot;Ninja Warrior&quot;), and the event featured a mix of athletes from both the obstacle racing and modern pentathlon communities. Australian gymnast Olivia Vivian—a grand finalist of &quot;Australian Ninja Warrior&quot;—won the gold in the women&#x27;s competition.

On 9 July 2022, Pentathlon United shared a survey of 213 responses from 40 countries, claiming that 68.5% of the respondents were current athletes, that indicated more than 92% of current modern pentathlon participants wanted to preserve the equestrian discipline as part of the sport. The group stated, &quot;A total of 74.18% chose the reformed version of equestrian, which puts horse welfare among the central themes, while concern over the cost and accessibility of the equestrian discipline is also acknowledged in the 16-point plan.&quot; Of those polled, Pentathlon United claimed that only athletes from the United Kingdom showed any support for an obstacle race, with athletes from the United States overwhelmingly voting for a reformed version of equestrian sport.

In October 2022, modern pentathlon&#x27;s elected Athletes Committee launched a campaign entitled #OurFuture, highlighting the views of pentathletes in favour of the change. Athletes such as Olympic silver medallists Elodie Clouvel (France) and Ahmed Elgendy (Egypt) supported the transition when participating in a media conference at UIPM Headquarters in Monaco. They were joined by Athletes Committee representatives including the group&#x27;s Chair, Yasser Hefny OLY (Egypt), Jamie Cooke (Great Britain) and Natalya Coyle OLY (Ireland), as well as former Pan American champion Tamara Vega (Mexico).

In November 2022, the UIPM Congress voted 69–11 in favor of replacing riding with obstacle course racing; an associated motion established that the changes would take effect for junior competition in 2023. The 2023 and 2024 junior world championships duly took place with obstacle in place of equestrian. The new format&#x27;s implementation at the senior level will be formalised after the 2024 Summer Olympics.

On 22 June 2023, the UIPM shared a poll of 1,500 Americans by YouGov that they commissioned in support of their decision to replace riding with obstacle course racing, citing that the survey showed that &quot;45% of Gen Z and 41% of Millennials more likely to watch the Olympics on television if it featured a ninja-style obstacle race...taken as a percentage of the U.S. population, this would equate to nearly 45 million more people watching the Games&quot;. The UIPM also stated, &quot;More than two-thirds (37%) of survey respondents said they would be more likely to watch the new-look Modern Pentathlon at the Olympic Games, and 46% of those cited enjoying ninja-style obstacle races as the reason, with 34% describing the reason for their answer: &#x27;I think the Modern Pentathlon needs to embrace change&#x27;.&quot; The article also indirectly referenced the popular TV show &quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;.

Іn August 2023 during the 2023 UIPM Pentathlon and Laser Run World Championships, the UIPM signed a memorandum of understanding with World Obstacle to collaborate on the integration of obstacle racing into the modern pentathlon at the senior level; UIPM president Klaus Schormann stated that the federation was &quot;want[ing] to bring a different challenge to the Olympic Movement, to be more urban and provide something that young generations will love.&quot; The MoU was criticised by Pentathlon United, who questioned World Obstacle&#x27;s finances (in particular, being funded solely by one person with no other commercial revenue). In October 2023, during the 141st IOC Session in Mumbai, the IOC voted to reinstate modern pentathlon with its new format for the 2028 Summer Olympics.

== Popularity ==
In 2021, modern pentathlon consistently had the least TV viewers of all Olympic sports, and also ranked at the bottom for internal Olympic measurements of social engagement. The Greek modern pentathlon coach said, &quot;We are an Olympic sport that is on the edge... We&#x27;re very, very low down, if not bottom, in a lot of ratings like ticket sales, viewership, and participation&quot;. Sports academic Jörg Krieger wrote in 2022 that the sport &quot;suffered from a lack of participation in the sport, as well as [having] limited public interest&quot;. However, KXAS-TV reporter Stephanie de Lancey called the compressed 90-minute format used at the 2024 Olympics &quot;fast and action-packed&quot; and said the replacement of show jumping for 2028 was &quot;a way for the sport to evolve in the 21st century.&quot;

A 2021 study by Quartz concluded that modern pentathlon (in the form that included equestrian) was the most expensive Olympic sport for entry-level costs. It found that to start modern pentathlon cost US$13,580 for equipment and facilities. Most other Olympic sports examined cost less than $500 to start in.
