<text>Spock is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; media franchise. He first appeared in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series serving aboard the starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; as science officer and first officer (and Kirk&#x27;s second-in-command) and later as commanding officer of the vessel. Spock&#x27;s mixed human–Vulcan heritage serves as an important plot element in many of the character&#x27;s appearances. Along with Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Dr. Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy (DeForest Kelley), he is one of the three central characters in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and its films. After retiring from active duty in Starfleet, Spock served as a Federation ambassador, and later became involved in the ill-fated attempt to save Romulus from a supernova, leading him to live out the rest of his life in a parallel universe.

Spock was played by Leonard Nimoy in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, eight of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; feature films, and a two-part episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Multiple actors have played the character since Nimoy within &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s main continuity; the most recent portrayal is Ethan Peck, who played Spock as a recurring character in the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; and in &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot;, and as a main character in &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; (both a &quot;Discovery&quot; spin-off and a prequel to the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series). Additionally, Zachary Quinto played an alternate reality version of Spock in the feature films &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009), &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013), and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (2016). Although the three films are set in the aforementioned parallel timeline, Nimoy appears in the first two as the original timeline&#x27;s Spock.

Aside from the series and films in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, Spock has also appeared in numerous novels, comics, and video games. Nimoy&#x27;s portrayal of Spock made a significant cultural impact and earned him three Emmy Award nominations. His public profile as Spock was so strong that both his autobiographies, &quot;I Am Not Spock&quot; (1975) and &quot;I Am Spock&quot; (1995), were written from the viewpoint of coexistence with the character.

==Appearances==
===Back story===
Born to the Vulcan Sarek (Mark Lenard) and the human Amanda Grayson (Jane Wyatt), Spock&#x27;s backstory has been addressed during several episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot; and the &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode, &quot;Yesteryear&quot;. His mixed heritage led to a troubled childhood; full-blooded Vulcan children repeatedly bullied him on their home world to incite the emotions of his human nature. For a time, he grew up alongside his older half-brother Sybok, until the older brother was cast out for rejecting logic. In &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, it is revealed that Spock has a human, adopted sister, Michael Burnham. According to the episode &quot;Amok Time&quot;, Spock was betrothed to T&#x27;Pring (Arlene Martel) during his childhood.

Sarek supported Spock&#x27;s scientific learning and application to the Vulcan Science Academy, as mentioned in &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;. In the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Spock rejects his acceptance into the Vulcan Science Academy on the basis that they would never fully accept someone who was only half-Vulcan. Although this film set the Kelvin timeline scene in this and later films, writer Roberto Orci stated that he felt that the actions were unaffected by the changes in this timeline and so would have occurred in the same manner prior to &quot;The Original Series&quot;. Because Spock did not enter the VSA and sought to join Starfleet instead, he did not speak to his father for the following 18 years.

===&quot;The Cage&quot; and the first season===
Spock appeared as the science officer on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the first pilot for the series, &quot;The Cage&quot;. This was not shown on television at the time, but the events of the episode were shown in the two-part episode &quot;The Menagerie&quot; of the first season, and Spock&#x27;s previous 11 years of service on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; were described. Spock was one of the members of the away team who joined Captain Christopher Pike (Jeffrey Hunter) on a mission to Talos IV to investigate a distress call. Spock did appear in the second pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, but this was broadcast initially as the third episode. During the events of that pilot, Spock became concerned at the risk to the ship posed by Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and suggested possible solutions to Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner).

The earliest appearance of Spock in the series as broadcast was in &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, the first such episode. When he needs to knock out an evil version of Kirk in &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, he uses a Vulcan nerve pinch. Spock and Chief Engineer Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott (James Doohan) work together to rejoin the good and evil versions of the Captain, which had been split following a transporter accident. During &quot;Miri&quot;, he finds himself to be the only member of the landing party to be immune to the physical effects of the disease affecting human adults on the planet. However, he realizes that he is probably a carrier and could infect the &quot;Enterprise&quot; if he were to return. Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) manages to devise a cure, allowing the team to return to the ship.
When Simon van Gelder enters the bridge armed with a phaser in &quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot;, Spock subdues him with a nerve pinch. He later conducts a mind meld with van Gelder as part of the investigation into the activities of the nearby colony. After power to the colony is shut down, and a protective force field drops, Spock leads an away team to rescue Kirk. Spock is reunited with Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney) in &quot;The Menagerie&quot;. Pike had been promoted to Fleet Captain but suffered an accident, resulting in severe burns and confining him to a wheelchair and restricting his communication to yes/no answers via a device connected to his brainwaves. Spock commits mutiny and directs the ship to travel to Talos IV, a banned planet. He recounts the events of &quot;The Cage&quot; under a tribunal to Kirk, Pike and Commodore Jose I. Mendez (Malachi Throne). As the &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at the planet, Mendez is revealed to be a Talosian illusion. At the same time, the real Mendez communicates from Starfleet, giving permission for Pike to be transported to the planet, and all charges against Spock are dropped.
While the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is under threat in &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;, Spock is accused by Lieutenant Stiles (Paul Comi) of knowing more about the Romulans than he admits when the alien&#x27;s similar physical appearance is revealed. Spock hypothesizes that they are an offshoot of the Vulcan race. He saves the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, manning the phaser station and saves the life of Stiles in the process. In &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot;, Spock leads a landing party on the shuttlecraft &quot;Galileo&quot;, which is damaged and pulled off its course before landing on the planet Taurus II. Lieutenant Boma (Don Marshall) criticizes Spock&#x27;s fascination with the weaponry of the natives after the death of Lieutenant Latimer (Rees Vaughn) at their hands. After Scotty uses the power packs of the party&#x27;s phasers to supply enough energy to get the damaged shuttle back into orbit, Spock decides to dump and ignite the remaining fuel to attract the attention of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The procedure is successful and the crew on the shuttle are rescued.

Spock encounters old acquaintance Leila Kalomi (Jill Ireland) in &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; after joining an away team to the planet Omicron Ceti III. After being affected by mind-altering spores, Spock begins acting out of character and with overt emotion, partaking in a romantic liaison with Kalomi, who had always desired a relationship but Spock had never reciprocated her feelings. The impact of the spores on him is cured after Kirk goads him into anger, and once freed of the effects, Spock is able to initiate a solution which cures the rest of the crew. Spock attempts to mind meld with a non-humanoid Horta in &quot;The Devil in the Dark&quot;, having initially suggested that Kirk should kill the creature. Following a second mind meld, Spock relays the history of the Horta and is able to create peace between the aliens and a nearby colony. Both Spock and Kirk undertake guerrilla warfare against the occupying Klingon forces on the planet Organia, prior to the establishment of the Organian Peace Treaty in &quot;Errand of Mercy&quot;. To restore the timeline, he travels with Kirk back to 1930&#x27;s New York City in &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;. He uses technology of that period to interface with his tricorder over the course of the weeks they spend in the period before witnessing Edith Keeler&#x27;s (Joan Collins) death.

===Season two and three===

During the premiere episode of the second season, &quot;Amok Time&quot;, Spock begins to undergo pon farr, the Vulcan blood fever, and must undergo a ritual mating in the next eight days or die. Kirk disobeys Starfleet orders and takes the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to the planet Vulcan so that Spock can undergo the mating ritual. When they arrive, he is reunited with T&#x27;Pring (Arlene Martel). She rather wishes to be with Stonn (Lawrence Montaigne), a full-blooded Vulcan. She demands the ritual kal-if-fee fight instead, and selects Kirk as her champion, who unknowingly agrees to a fight to the death with Spock. McCoy persuades T&#x27;Pau (Celia Lovsky) to let him inject Kirk with something to alleviate the issues with Vulcan&#x27;s thinner atmosphere and make the fight fair. The fight begins, and Spock gains the upper hand, garroting Kirk and killing him. McCoy orders an emergency transport directly to sickbay, while Spock is told by T&#x27;Pring that it was all a game of logic which would let her be with Stonn no matter the outcome. No longer feeling the effects of the pon farr, Spock returns to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; where he discovers that McCoy had injected Kirk with a paralyzing agent which merely simulated death and that the Captain was still alive.Over the course of the encounter with the &quot;Nomad&quot; space probe in &quot;The Changeling&quot;, Spock undertakes a mind meld with the machine. Kirk stops the meld when he realizes that Spock&#x27;s personality starts to be changed by the contact. Following a transporter accident which transports Kirk, McCoy, Uhura and Scotty to a Mirror Universe and swaps them with their counterparts in the episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, they encounter a different version of Spock. Sporting a beard, he grows suspicious of the activities of the suddenly changed personnel and under Starfleet orders, attempts to kill Kirk. Mirror-Spock is knocked unconscious, and is treated by McCoy while the others head to the transporter to attempt to return to their universe. Spock awakes and mind melds with McCoy to discover why Kirk did not have him killed. Discovering what took place, he agrees to help them return and as he mans the transporter controls, Kirk implores him to take control and save not only the ship but his Terran Empire from implosion at the hands of tyrants. The switch is once again successful, and the crew members return to their relevant universes.

===&quot;The Motion Picture&quot; and the film series===
At the beginning of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979), Spock is no longer serving in Starfleet, having resigned and returned home to pursue the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr. Unable to complete the Kolinahr ritual after he senses the coming of V&#x27;ger, he rejoins Starfleet to aid the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew in their mission. Spock, promoted to captain, is commanding officer of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; at the beginning of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982). At the film&#x27;s end, he transfers his &quot;katra&quot; – the sum of his memories and experience – to McCoy, and then sacrifices himself to save the ship and its crew from Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalbán). The sequel, &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984), focuses on his crewmates&#x27; quest to recover Spock&#x27;s body, learning upon arrival that he has been resurrected by the Genesis matrix after landing on the planet at the end of the previous film. At the film&#x27;s conclusion, Spock&#x27;s revived body is reunited with his katra. Spock is next seen in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986), which depicts his recovery from the after-effects of his resurrection. After saving planet Earth with his comrades, Spock reconciles with his father who has reconsidered his opinion regarding Spock&#x27;s life choices and his friends. In the film&#x27;s final scene, he joins the crew of the newly commissioned USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A under Kirk&#x27;s command. In &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989), Spock and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew confront the renegade Sybok, Spock&#x27;s half-brother. &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991) reunites the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew on a mission to prevent war from erupting between the Federation and Klingon Empire. Spock serves as a special envoy to broker peace with the Klingons after a natural disaster devastates their homeworld.

===&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;===
After a period during which the production team avoided mentioning some aspects of The Original Series, Spock was mentioned by name in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in the episode &quot;Sarek&quot; (1990). Executive producer Michael Piller later described this one act as &quot;the breakthrough which allowed us to open the doors, that allowed us to begin to embrace our past&quot;.

Spock appears in &quot;Unification&quot; (1991), a two-part episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Set 75 years after the events of &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot;, the episode focuses on Federation Ambassador Spock&#x27;s attempt to reunite the Romulans with their Vulcan brethren. Filming of &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot; overlapped with production of this episode, and the episode references Spock&#x27;s role in the film. While Spock&#x27;s initial unification campaign fails, he chooses to remain on Romulus in secret to help the movement.

===Reboot films===
====&quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009)====
Spock&#x27;s next appearance in the live action &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise is the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film. Nimoy was given approval rights over Spock&#x27;s casting and supported Quinto being cast as the role. During the film&#x27;s flashback, set 19 years after the events of &quot;Unification&quot;, and as depicted in the comic miniseries &quot;Star Trek: Countdown&quot;, Ambassador Spock (Nimoy) promises the Romulans he will use Vulcan technology to save them from a rogue supernova that threatens to destroy their Empire. He pilots an advanced starship equipped with red matter, a powerful substance able to create artificial black holes. The mission is only partially successful, and in the aftermath, Spock is pursued into the past by Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan driven mad by the loss of his homeworld and family, setting into motion the events of the film.

In the film&#x27;s opening act, Nero&#x27;s ship emerges in the year 2233, and through its interaction with the inhabitants, inadvertently creates an &quot;alternate, parallel &#x27;Star Trek&#x27; universe&quot;. Twenty-five years later, in the new reality, Spock&#x27;s ship emerges and Nero captures him and the red matter. Stranded in the alternate past, the prime version of Spock helps the alternate, younger version of himself and Kirk (Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine, respectively) thwart Nero&#x27;s attempt to destroy the Federation.

The film also features Jacob Kogan in several scenes depicting Spock&#x27;s childhood, including his abuse at the hands of other Vulcan children due to his half-Human heritage, and his relationship with his parents (Ben Cross and Winona Ryder). The film also depicts Kirk and Spock&#x27;s initial clashes at Starfleet Academy, and the gradual development of their friendship based on shared mutual respect, what the elder Spock calls &quot;...a friendship that will define them both in ways they cannot yet realize.&quot; A major change in characterization from the primary timeline is alternate Spock&#x27;s involvement with alternate Uhura (Zoe Saldana), his former student. At the end of the film, the young Spock opts to remain in Starfleet while his older self stays in the altered universe to aid the few surviving Vulcan refugees, as Nero had destroyed Vulcan, Spock&#x27;s home planet.

====&quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013)====

In &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, Spock Prime is described as living on &#x27;New Vulcan&#x27; while the younger Spock remains aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, struggling with the loss of his home world, as well as his relationships with Uhura and James T. Kirk. Spock nearly dies protecting a planet from an active volcano, but Kirk breaks the Prime Directive and saves him. Spock Prime is contacted by Spock on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, to find out details on Khan. Spock Prime initially reminds his alternate self that he will not interfere with the events in the alternate timeline. That being said, he then informs Spock that Khan was a dangerous man, and the greatest threat that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; ever faced in his own timeline, and warns that he is likely as dangerous in Spock&#x27;s alternate timeline as well. When asked whether Khan was defeated, Spock Prime answers that he eventually was defeated, but at great cost (referring to the events of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;). When Kirk contracts radiation poisoning and dies in front of Spock (a transposed parallel of events in the prime timeline where Spock dies in front of Kirk), an enraged and vengeful Spock attempts to kill Khan to avenge Kirk before Uhura informs him that Khan&#x27;s regenerative blood can revive Kirk. Nearly a year later, Spock remains as Kirk&#x27;s chief science officer and executive officer as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; departs on its first five-year mission of deep-space exploration.

&quot;Into Darkness&quot; would be Nimoy&#x27;s final appearance as Spock Prime, as well as the last role of his career. He died in 2015, shortly before production began on &quot;Star Trek Beyond.&quot;

====&quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (2016)====

In &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, Spock receives word that Ambassador Spock (Spock Prime) has died. Impacted by this, Spock later tells McCoy that he intends to leave Starfleet to continue the ambassador&#x27;s work on New Vulcan. At the end of the film, Spock receives a box containing some of Ambassador Spock&#x27;s personal effects, and reflecting on a photograph of the older crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; from the series&#x27; original timeline, he chooses to remain in Starfleet.

===&quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;===

In August 2018, it was announced that Ethan Peck would join the cast of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; as Spock in the show&#x27;s second season, portraying a Spock younger than both Nimoy&#x27;s and Quinto&#x27;s renditions of the character, as &quot;Discovery&quot; is set several years before the Original Series and Kelvin Timeline films.

As of his appearances on &quot;Discovery&quot;, Spock is a Lieutenant, serving under Captain Christopher Pike on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Due to the trauma Spock suffered because of his visions of the &quot;Red Angel&quot;, he is on leave from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and under psychiatric care. His adopted sister Michael Burnham is attempting to help him recover.

The introduction to the second-season episode, &quot;If Memory Serves&quot;, uses archival footage of Nimoy as Spock from the unaired pilot episode &quot;The Cage&quot;, and the third-season episode &quot;Unification III&quot; uses archival footage of Nimoy again from the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Unification II&quot;. The latter appearance is a holographic recording from the records of Jean-Luc Picard, and is shown to Michael Burnham after she travels to the 31st Century, a time in which the Romulan and Vulcan peoples remember Ambassador Spock as the cause of their reunification on the planet Ni&#x27;Var, the newly renamed Vulcan.

===&quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot;===
In 2019, it was announced that the character Spock, as played by Peck would appear in two &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot;, along with Captain Pike. He reprised the role in the episodes &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; and &quot;Ask Not&quot;.

=== &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; ===
In May 2020, it was announced that Spock (Ethan Peck) would return in the series &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; alongside Captain Pike (Anson Mount) and Number One / Una (Rebecca Romijn).

==Development==
===&quot;The Original Series&quot;===
The earliest known mention of Spock occurred during a conversation between &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s creator, Gene Roddenberry, and actor Gary Lockwood, in which Lockwood suggested Leonard Nimoy for the role. The trio had previously worked together on Roddenberry&#x27;s &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, in the episode &quot;In the Highest Tradition&quot;. Roddenberry agreed to the idea, but was required to audition other actors for the part. At the time, Roddenberry sought DeForest Kelley to play the doctor character in the pilot, &quot;The Cage&quot;, but both NBC executives and director Robert Butler wanted Kelley to play Spock. Roddenberry offered the part to both Kelley and Martin Landau, but they both turned him down. When offered, Nimoy accepted the part, but was apprehensive about the make-up, which had not yet been determined.

During an interview segment of TV Land&#x27;s 40th anniversary &quot;Star Trek&quot; marathon on November 12, 2006, Leonard Nimoy stated that Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s first choice to play Spock was George Lindsey. Because of the flippant way Nimoy makes the comment, it has been suggested that he was joking. The claim Lindsey was offered the role is given more credibility when Lindsey&#x27;s close friend Ernest Borgnine writes in his autobiography, &quot;my hand to God – he turned down the part of Mr. Spock on TV&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the role that made Leonard Nimoy famous.&quot;

The character evolved from having a metal plate in his stomach, through which he ingested energy, to being a half-Martian in the original 1964 pitch, with a &quot;slightly reddish complexion and semi-pointed ears&quot;. Due to Roddenberry&#x27;s concern that a Mars landing might take place before the end of the series, Spock&#x27;s home planet was changed. Lee Greenway conducted the initial makeup tests on Nimoy, but after four or five days, Fred Phillips was asked to take over. Phillips in turn asked John Chambers to create Spock&#x27;s ears, as he was working on getting an appropriate shade of red for Spock&#x27;s skin; this idea was later abandoned in favor of a yellow hue because of the effects on black and white television. Nimoy hated the ears, and Roddenberry promised him that if he was still unhappy by the 13th episode then they&#x27;d find a way to write them out. The NBC executives were also concerned, as they felt it made the character satanic.

At Roddenberry&#x27;s insistence, Spock was the only character retained for the second pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. However, NBC demanded that he be only a background character, and when it went to series, the tips of Spock&#x27;s ears were airbrushed out on promotional materials. It was during early episodes such as &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; and &quot;The Naked Time&quot; that Nimoy came to understand the nature of the character. After eight episodes, NBC executives complained to Roddenberry that there was not enough Spock in the series; &quot;Spockmania&quot; had begun. In response, Spock was moved to a more prominent role within the series, such as taking the lead role in &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; over Sulu. The popularity of the character caused frictions with Shatner, and rumors spread that he was going to be dropped from the show and replaced as the lead by Nimoy as Spock. A drawn out contract renegotiation at the start of season two resulted in Roddenberry considering whether or not to replace Nimoy and the character. Both Mark Lenard and Lawrence Montaigne were seriously considered.

The character continued to develop, with Nimoy creating the Vulcan salute during the filming of &quot;Amok Time&quot;. This was based on a Jewish Kohen he had seen as a child. During the course of the season, a rift grew between Nimoy and Roddenberry and by the end of the year, they only spoke through formal letters. After the departure of producer Gene L. Coon and the stepping back of Roddenberry during the third season, Nimoy found that the writing of Spock deteriorated. In particular, he did not like the character being made a fool of during the episode &quot;Spock&#x27;s Brain&quot;. The interracial kiss between Kirk and Uhura in &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot; had been intended by the writers to be between Spock and Uhura, but Shatner persuaded them to change it.

For his role as Spock, Leonard Nimoy was nominated three times Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and is currently the only &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor to be nominated for an Emmy.

===Revival attempts and the film franchise===

Nimoy agreed to return to Spock during one of the early 1970s attempts to create a &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, entitled &quot;Star Trek: The God Thing&quot;, but dropped out after his likeness as Spock was used without permission to advertise Heineken beer. He was persuaded to return to the role of Spock as the lead for the planned &quot;Trek&quot; film titled &quot;Planet of the Titans&quot; to be directed by Philip Kaufman. When this project was killed in favor of a new television series, &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;, Nimoy was reportedly just offered only a recurring part by Roddenberry, so refused to appear at all. When the decision was made to turn the TV pilot script into &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, director Robert Wise insisted Nimoy to return as the character, which was only accomplished by Jeffrey Katzenberg forcing Paramount to settle the dispute with Nimoy over licensing use of his image.

As on the series, Nimoy, calling on method acting training, would often not break character between takes.

Dissatisfied with the first Trek feature, Nimoy was reluctant to return for &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; but was convinced by the promise of a dramatic death scene. Nimoy enjoyed the production of the film so much that despite his character&#x27;s on-screen death he wanted to return for a sequel. The film&#x27;s success allowed Nimoy to successfully negotiate to direct the next installment in addition to briefly appearing as a reanimated Spock. The resulting film, &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; was successful enough that Nimoy was asked to direct once more for &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;. The following film of the series, the William Shatner-directed &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; was initially unacceptable to Nimoy because it called for Spock to betray Kirk and side with his newly introduced half-brother Sybok. Nimoy felt his character had already come to terms with his human-side thus Sybok would have no influence on him, and forced the script to be changed before signing on. Nimoy subsequently organized &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, choosing the director, writers and producers. To hand over to &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; at the time of &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot;, Nimoy agreed to appear as Spock in the episode &quot;Unification&quot;. Nimoy subsequently turned down the directing role on &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; as he wanted to rework the script, and refused reprising the role of Spock for what was essentially a cameo appearance, and his character&#x27;s lines were subsequently given to Scotty.

When recasting the role for 2009&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Nimoy was asked his opinion. He highlighted the work of Zachary Quinto, as he felt he looked similar and could portray the inner thought process of the character. Quinto became the first actor to be cast for the film, and Nimoy agreed to return as the version of the character from the &quot;Prime&quot; universe. Nimoy said that he returned because of the enthusiasm from director J. J. Abrams and the writers, and because it made him feel appreciated. Nimoy made a final appearance as Spock in &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; as a favor to Abrams. At the time, he did not rule out returning again, but he died prior to the following film. In &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, Quinto&#x27;s Spock mourns the loss of Spock Prime, as played by Nimoy.

==Reception==
&quot;Given the choice&quot;, Nimoy said years after the show ended, &quot;if I had to be someone else, I would be Spock.&quot; He recalled, more than a decade after the show&#x27;s cancellation:

From early on, the public reacted very positively—even fanatically—to his character, in what &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 1967 described as &quot;Spockmania&quot;. Headshots of Spock became popular souvenirs, with the rare ones of the actor laughing the most valuable. Nimoy reported that &quot;within two weeks after [&quot;Amok Time&quot;], my mail jumped from a few hundred letters to 10,000 a week&quot;. When he appeared as Spock as grand marshal of a Medford, Oregon, parade in April 1967, thousands gathered to receive autographs: &quot;They surged forward so quickly that I was terrified someone would be crushed to death; and then they started pressing against the bandstand so hard it began to sway beneath my feet!&quot; After being rescued by police, &quot;I made sure never to appear publicly again in Vulcan guise&quot;, Nimoy stated.

Fans asked Nimoy questions about current events such as the Vietnam War and LSD as if he were the Vulcan scientist; one even asked the actor to lay his hands on a friend&#x27;s eyes to heal them. When a biracial girl wrote asking for advice on how to deal with persecution as &quot;a half-breed&quot;, Nimoy responded that young Vulcans had treated Spock similarly and that she should, as he did, &quot;realize the difference between popularity and true greatness&quot;. The actor believed that the character appealed to viewers, especially teenagers, because

To Nimoy&#x27;s surprise, Spock became a sex symbol; Isaac Asimov described the character as &quot;a security blanket with sexual overtones&quot; and Nimoy reported, &quot;I&#x27;ve never had more female attention on a set before. And get this: they all want to &quot;touch the ears!&quot;&quot; (When a young woman asked &quot;Are you aware that you are the source of erotic dream material for thousands and thousands of ladies around the world?&quot;, he replied &quot;May all your dreams come true&quot;.) Nimoy speculated that Spock appealed to women because

NASA made Spock an informal mascot. Nimoy was invited to be guest of honor at the March 1967 National Space Club dinner and to take an extensive tour of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. The actor concluded from the warm and intense reception he received that astronauts like John Glenn and aerospace industry engineers, secretaries, and shareholders alike all regarded &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and especially the character of Spock, as a &quot;dramatization of the future of their space program&quot;.

An asteroid in the Eos family discovered on August 16, 1971, was named Mr. Spock after the discoverer James B. Gibson&#x27;s cat (which had been named Mr. Spock, who was likewise &quot;imperturbable, logical, intelligent, and had pointed ears&quot;).

Spock proved inspirational to many budding scientists and engineers. Nimoy has said that many of them, on meeting him, were eager to show him their work and discuss it with him as if he were a scientific peer, as opposed to an actor, photographer, and poet. His stock response in these situations was &quot;it certainly looks like you&#x27;re headed in the right direction&quot;.

In 2004, Spock was ranked number 21 in Bravo&#x27;s list of The 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 2008, UGO named Spock one of the 50 greatest TV characters. According to Shatner, much of &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s acting praise and media interest went to Nimoy.

In 2012, IGN ranked the character Spock, as depicted in the original series and the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, as the second top character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, with Kirk in the top spot.

In 2016, Adam Nimoy released his documentary film &quot;For the Love of Spock&quot;, about his father and his iconic character.

In 2017, Screen Rant ranked Spock the 5th most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, in between Michael Burnham and Seven of Nine. In 2018, they ranked Spock as one of the top 8 most powerful characters of &quot;Star Trek&quot; (including later series).

In 2018, CBR ranked Spock the 6th best Starfleet character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

===Reaction to Spock&#x27;s death===
&quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; had its first public screening at a science-fiction convention in Overland Park, Kansas on May 8, 1982, almost a month before general release. Although Paramount executives were concerned that Spock&#x27;s death would set fans against the movie, the audience actually applauded after Spock&#x27;s death scene. &quot;It was sensational. I hate to be given to superlatives but it absolutely reached everything we wanted it to. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better,&quot; said co-producer Robert Sallin of the advance audience&#x27;s reaction.

Critical reaction to Spock&#x27;s death was mixed. Film critic Roger Ebert lauded Spock&#x27;s death: &quot;He makes a choice in &quot;Star Trek II&quot; that would be made only by a hero, a fool, or a Vulcan. And when he makes his decision, the movie rises to one of its best scenes, because the &quot;Star Trek&quot; stories have always been best when they centered on their characters.&quot; Conversely, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Gary Arnold states that Spock&#x27;s death &quot;feels like an unnecessary twist, and the filmmakers are obviously well-prepared to fudge in case the public demands another sequel.&quot;

Twenty-five years later, Spock&#x27;s death in &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; ranks number 2 on Total Film&#x27;s list of 25 greatest &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie moments, and number 1 on IGN Movie&#x27;s top 10 &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie moments.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009)===
Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described Quinto&#x27;s performance in the 2009 film as &quot;something special&quot;, and stated that Nimoy&#x27;s appearance &quot;carries much more emotion than you&#x27;d expect&quot;. &quot;Slate&quot; said Quinto played Spock &quot;with a few degrees more chill&quot; than Nimoy brought to the original character. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that Quinto &quot;...invests Spock with a new layer of chilly-smoldering sex appeal, [and] Quinto does a fantastic job of maintaining Spock&#x27;s calm, no-sweat surface but getting quietly hot and bothered underneath.&quot;

== Cultural impact ==
Spock has been parodied by, and has also been the inspiration for, pop culture works in various media. Composer/keyboardist George Duke&#x27;s &quot;1976 Solo Keyboard Album&quot; features two tracks which pay homage to Spock: &quot;Spock Gets Funky&quot; and &quot;Vulcan Mind Probe&quot;. Rock guitarist Paul Gilbert wrote the song &quot;Mr. Spock&quot; on his &quot;Space Ship One&quot; album. Swedish synthpop band S.P.O.C.K makes music heavily influenced by the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. Assuming the Spock character, Nimoy recorded a number of novelty songs, the first being &quot;Highly Illogical&quot;, in which Spock pointed out the foibles of human thought, such as relationships, automobiles, and greed. A second song, &quot;A Visit to a Sad Planet&quot;, was darker in tone and told the story of Spock visiting Earth in the future and discovering it had been ruined by war, violence, and environmental irresponsibility. According to comic book writer and editor Bob Budiansky, &quot;The Transformers&quot; character Shockwave was inspired by Spock. Spock&#x27;s utilitarian perspective that &quot;the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few&quot; is cited in a legal decision rendered by the Texas Supreme Court. Leonard Nimoy&#x27;s second-season Spock costume shirt was expected to sell at auction for over $75,000.

Spock&#x27;s physical appearance in the &quot;Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; (1967) has itself spawned a trope of the &quot;evil twin&quot; archetype found in various fictional genres. In that episode, several members of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; travel to a parallel universe inhabited by evil versions of themselves. The parallel universe version of Spock is distinguished physically by his goatee. Science fiction blog io9 said that Spock&#x27;s beard in the episode introduced &quot;the best shorthand ever for evil parallel universe duplicates&quot;. Examples of the evil goatee&#x27;s appearances in other media include the host segments of episode 611 of the TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000, Bender&#x27;s &quot;evil twin&quot; Flexo in &quot;Futurama&quot;, and a 2009 episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; featuring Stephen Colbert and Dan Maffei wearing fake goatees while pretending to be evil versions of themselves. The name of progressive rock band Spock&#x27;s Beard is a direct reference to Spock&#x27;s goatee in this episode.

===Fan productions===
In addition to television, feature films, books, and parodies, Spock has also been portrayed in non-canon fan fiction. Since 2004, the online fan production &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; has continued the further voyages of the canceled initial series. The fan-series&#x27; creators feel &quot;Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and the rest should be treated as &#x27;classic&#x27; characters like Willy Loman from &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, Gandalf from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, or even Hamlet, Othello, or Romeo. Many actors have and can play the roles, each offering a different interpretation of said character.&quot;

The fan series &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; has featured three actors in the role of Spock. Spock was portrayed by Jeffrey Quinn for the pilot and first three episodes, by Ben Tolpin in episodes 4 and 5, and by Brandon Stacy in episodes 6 through 11. Stacy also served as a stand-in for Zachary Quinto in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film.

The independent online fan series &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot; featured Todd Haberkorn as Spock in three vignettes and eleven full episodes between 2013 and 2017.

In scientific illustrator Jenny Parks&#x27; 2017 book &quot;Star Trek Cats&quot;, Spock is depicted as an Oriental Shorthair.

===&quot;Spocking&quot; Canadian $5 notes===
There has been a practice of altering the portrait of Wilfrid Laurier, Canada&#x27;s prime minister from 1896 to 1911, on Canadian five-dollar notes to look like Spock. After the death of Nimoy in 2015, there was an increase in that practice.

<text>Majel Barrett-Roddenberry ( ; born Majel Leigh Hudec; February 23, 1932 – December 18, 2008) was an American actress. She was best known for her roles as various characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise: Nurse Christine Chapel (in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, and two films of the franchise), Number One (also in the original series), Lwaxana Troi (on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;), and the voice of most onboard computer interfaces throughout the series from 1966 to 2023. She married &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry in 1969. As his wife and given her relationship with &quot;Star Trek&quot;participating in some way in every series during her lifetimeshe is sometimes referred to as &quot;the First Lady of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

==Early life==
Barrett was born in Cleveland, Ohio. She began taking acting classes as a child. She graduated from Shaker Heights High School in Shaker Heights, Ohio. She went to the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, then had some stage roles and arrived in Hollywood. Her father, William Hudec, was a Cleveland police officer. He was killed in the line of duty while driving a police ambulance which was struck by an Erie Passenger Train at East 91st Street and Loren Avenue on August 30, 1955. The tragedy occurred while Barrett was touring with an off-Broadway road company.

==Career==
Barrett was briefly seen in &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; (1957) in an ad parody at the beginning of the film, and had roles in a few films, including &quot;Love in a Goldfish Bowl&quot; (1961), &quot;Sylvia&quot; (1965), &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot; (1967), and &quot;Track of Thunder&quot; (1967). She worked at the Desilu Studios on several TV shows, including &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, and &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; (produced by Gene Roddenberry). She received training in comedy from Lucille Ball. In 1960, she played Gwen Rutherford on &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
In various roles, Barrett participated in every incarnation of the popular science fiction &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise produced during her lifetime, including live-action and animated versions, television and cinema, and nearly all of the time periods in which the various series have been set.

She first appeared in &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s initial pilot, &quot;The Cage&quot; (1964), as the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s unnamed first officer, &quot;Number One&quot;. Barrett was romantically involved with Roddenberry, whose marriage was on the verge of failing at the time, and the idea of having an otherwise unknown woman in a leading role just because she was the producer&#x27;s girlfriend is said to have infuriated NBC network executives who insisted that Roddenberry give the role to a man. William Shatner corroborated this in &quot;Star Trek Memories&quot;, and added that female viewers at test screenings hated the character as well. Shatner said that female viewers felt she was &quot;pushy&quot; and &quot;annoying&quot; and also thought that &quot;Number One shouldn&#x27;t be trying so hard to fit in with the men.&quot; Barrett often joked that Roddenberry, given the choice between keeping Mr. Spock (whom the network also hated) or the woman character, &quot;kept the Vulcan and married the woman, &#x27;cause he didn&#x27;t think Leonard [Nimoy] would have it the other way around&quot;.

When Roddenberry was casting for the second &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, she changed her last name from Hudec to Barrett and wore a blond wig for the role of nurse Christine Chapel, a frequently recurring character, who was introduced in &quot;The Naked Time&quot;, the sixth new episode recorded, and was known for her unrequited affection for the dispassionate Spock. Her first appearance as Chapel in film dailies prompted NBC executive Jerry Stanley to yodel &quot;Well, well—look who&#x27;s back!&quot; 

In an early scene in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, viewers are informed that she has now become Doctor Chapel, a role which she reprised briefly in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, as Commander Chapel. Barrett provided several voices for &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, including those of Nurse Chapel and a communications officer named M&#x27;Ress, an ailuroid officer who served alongside Uhura.

Barrett returned years later in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, cast as the outrageously self-assertive, iconoclastic Betazoid ambassador, Lwaxana Troi, who appeared as a recurring character in the series, often visiting her daughter Deanna, the ship&#x27;s counselor. Her character often vexed the captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Jean-Luc Picard, who spurned her amorous advances. She later appeared as Ambassador Troi in several episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, where her character developed a strong relationship with Constable Odo.

She was the regular voice of the onboard computers of Federation starships for &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, and most of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies. She reprised her role as a shipboard computer&#x27;s voice in two episodes of the prequel series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, thus making her the only actor to have a role in all six televised &quot;Star Trek&quot; series produced up to that time. She also lent her voice to various computer games and software related to the franchise. The association of her voice with interactions with computers led to Google&#x27;s Assistant project being initially codenamed Google Majel. She made a point of attending a major &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention each year in an effort to inspire fans and keep the franchise alive.

On December 9, 2008, shortly before her death, Roddenberry Productions announced that she would be providing the voice of the ship&#x27;s computer again, this time for the 2009 motion picture reboot of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

===Other roles===
She appeared as Primus Dominic in Roddenberry&#x27;s 1973 postapocalyptic TV drama pilot, &quot;Genesis II&quot;; as Dr. Bradley in his 1974 television film &quot;The Questor Tapes&quot; and as Lilith the housekeeper in his 1977 TV drama pilot, &quot;Spectre&quot;. She also appeared in Michael Crichton&#x27;s 1973 sci-fi Western, &quot;Westworld&quot; as Miss Carrie, a robot brothel madam; the 1977 Stanley Kramer thriller &quot;The Domino Principle&quot;; and the 1979 television film &quot;The Man in the Santa Claus Suit&quot; starring Fred Astaire. Her later film appearances included small roles in &quot;Teresa&#x27;s Tattoo&quot; (1994) and &quot;Mommy&quot; (1995).

After Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s death, Barrett took material from his archives to bring two of his ideas into production. She was executive producer of &quot;&quot; (in which she also played the character Dr. Julianne Belman), and &quot;Andromeda&quot;. She also served as creative director for &quot;Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s Lost Universe&quot;, a comic book series based on another archival Roddenberry concept.

In a gesture of goodwill between the creators of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise and of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, she appeared in the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;Point of No Return&quot;, as Lady Morella, the psychic widow of the Centauri emperor, a role which foreshadowed major plot elements in the series. Parodying her voice work as the computer for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, Barrett performed as a guest voice on &quot;Family Guy&quot; as the voice of Stewie Griffin&#x27;s ship&#x27;s computer in the episode &quot;Emission Impossible&quot;.

Barrett&#x27;s widely recognized voice performance as the &quot;Star Trek&quot; computer inspired the Amazon Alexa interactive virtual assistant, according to its developer Toni Reid, although Barrett had no direct role in it.

===Final voiceover work===
Some of Barrett&#x27;s final voiceover work was still in post-production, to be released in 2009 after her death, as mentioned in the credits of the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, again as the voice of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; computer. An animated production called &quot;Hamlet A.D.D.&quot; credited her as Majel Barrett Roddenberry, playing the voiceover role of Queen Robot.

==Personal life and death==

In 1969, while scouting locations in Japan for MGM, Roddenberry realized that he missed Barrett, and proposed to her by telephone. Herbert F. Solow said that Roddenberry traveled to Japan with the intention of marrying Barrett. Barrett joined Roddenberry in Tokyo, where they were married in a Shinto ceremony on August 6, 1969. Roddenberry considered it &quot;sacrilegious&quot; to have an American minister in Japan perform the ceremony. The wedding was attended by two Shinto priests as well as maids of honor. Roddenberry and Barrett both wore kimonos; on their honeymoon they toured Japan. Roddenberry continued to have liaisons with other women, telling his friends that while in Japan, he had an encounter with a masseuse about a week after he was married.

The new marriage was not legally binding, as his divorce from Eileen had not yet been finalized. This was resolved two days after his divorce was complete, and on December 29, a small ceremony was held at their home, followed by a reception for family and friends. Despite that, the couple continued to celebrate August 6 as their wedding anniversary. Roddenberry&#x27;s young daughter, Dawn, decided to live with him and Barrett and the family moved to a new house in Beverly Hills in October 1970. In February 1974, Barrett and Roddenberry had a son, Eugene Jr., known as Rod Roddenberry. They remained married until Gene&#x27;s death at Barrett&#x27;s side on October 24, 1991, in Santa Monica, California.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Barrett-Roddenberry commissioned Celestis to launch her together with Gene on an infinite mission to deepest space. After putting them on the manifest for NASA&#x27;s &quot;Sunjammer&quot; mission, the agency cancelled the mission in 2014. Celestis rescheduled a launch for 2020, then later rescheduled it for June 2022, the next available commercial mission to deep space. A sample of the couple&#x27;s cremated remains would be sealed into a specially made capsule designed to withstand space travel. A spacecraft will carry the capsule along with digitized tributes from fans, on Celestis&#x27; &quot;Enterprise Flight&quot;. The flight also would contain the ashes of Nichelle Nichols and Douglas Trumbull. The Celestis &quot;Enterprise Flight&quot; was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on January 8, 2024.

Barrett-Roddenberry died on the morning of December 18, 2008, at her home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California, as a result of leukemia. She was 76 years old. A public funeral was held on January 4, 2009, in Los Angeles. More than 250 people attended, including Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, Walter Koenig, Marina Sirtis, Brent Spiner, and Wil Wheaton.

==Honors==
Barrett and her husband were honored in 2002 by the Space Foundation with the Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award for their work creating awareness of and enthusiasm for space.

Amazon code-named the project which eventually became Alexa as “Majel.”

<text>Passive review is the opposite of active recall, in which the learning material is processed passively (e.g., by reading, watching, etc.).

For example, to improve memory through passive review, an individual may read a text today; to not forget it, it is repeated tomorrow and then 4 days later and then 8, 16, 32, 64, etc., days later. They don&#x27;t ask themselves to explain the content of the text, but only reread the content. If they think to recall something, they are more likely to keep it in their memory. A passive review strategy includes music as an accompaniment. Particularly, the learner listens to Baroque music playing in the background while rhythmically repeating key material.

Passive review can also be combined with other learning strategy to further enhance outcomes. For instance, the so-called Suggestive Accelerated Learning and Teaching Techniques (SALTT) alternate it with active recall and are complemented by physical relaxation exercise, and cooperative learning, among others.

Passive review is a simple method, but it is not as effective. Active recall is more complicated and difficult (because it forces one to recall something) but it is highly effective.

<doc id="53589" wikidata="Q2870228" url="?curid=53589" title="To Sail Beyond the Sunset">
<text>To Sail Beyond the Sunset is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, published in 1987. It was the last novel published before his death in 1988. The title is taken from the poem &quot;Ulysses&quot;, by Alfred Tennyson. The stanza of which it is a part, quoted by a character in the novel, is as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;
... my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
&lt;/poem&gt;

It is the final part of the &quot;Lazarus Long&quot; cycle of stories, involving time travel, parallel dimensions, free love, voluntary incest, and a concept that Heinlein named pantheistic solipsism, or &#x27;World as Myth&#x27;: the theory that universes are created by the act of imagining them, so that somewhere (for example) the Land of Oz is real. Other books in the cycle include &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;, &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, and &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;.

==Plot==
The book is a memoir of Maureen Johnson Smith Long, mother, lover, and eventual wife of Lazarus Long. Maureen is ostensibly recording the events of the book while held in prison alongside Pixel, the cat from &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;.

Maureen, born on July 4, 1882, recounts her girlhood in backcountry Missouri, discovery that her family is a member of the long-lived Howard Families (whose backstory is revealed in &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;), marriage to Brian Smith, another member of that group, and her life—largely in Kansas City—until her apparent death in 1982. In addition, Maureen lives through, and gives her (sometimes contradictory) viewpoints on many events in other Heinlein stories, most notably the 1917 visit from the future by &quot;Ted Bronson&quot; (Lazarus Long), told from Long&#x27;s point of view in &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, D. D. Harriman&#x27;s space program from &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;, and the rolling roads from &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot;.

Maureen&#x27;s adventures include a series of sexual encounters, beginning in childhood wherein, having just had her first sexual intercourse, she is examined by her father, a doctor, and finds herself desiring him sexually. Her story then encompasses various boys, her husband, ministers, other women&#x27;s husbands, boyfriends, swinging sessions, and the adult Lazarus Long/Theodore Bronson. Additionally, she continues a lifelong pursuit of her father sexually, encourages her husband to have sexual intercourse with their daughters, and accompanies him when he does; but forbids a son and daughter of hers from continuing an incestuous relationship, primarily for the sister&#x27;s reluctance to share the brother with other women. All of these are set against a history lesson of an alternate 20th century in which a variety of social and philosophical commentary is delivered.

She is eventually rescued from prison by Lazarus Long and other characters of various novels in the ship &quot;Gay Deceiver&quot; (from &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;), and after rescuing her father from certain death in the Battle of Britain, is united with her descendants in a massive group marriage in the settlement of Boondock, on the planet Tertius. Maureen ends her memoir and the Lazarus Long saga with the phrase &quot;And we all lived happily ever after&quot;.

<doc id="53590" wikidata="Q945382" url="?curid=53590" title="Double Star">
<text>Double Star is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first serialized in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (February, March, and April 1956) and published in hardcover the same year. It received the 1956 Hugo Award for Best Novel (his first).

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in a future when the Moon, Mars, Venus and Jupiter&#x27;s satellites have been colonized and the Solar System is governed by a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy from a capital city on the Moon. The indigenous alien race inhabiting Mars has recently been admitted to citizenship in the human-dominated solar system government.
The story, which is told in the first person, centers on down-and-out actor Lawrence Smith (stage name Lorenzo Smythe, also known as &quot;The Great Lorenzo&quot;). A brilliant actor and mimic, he is down to his last coin when a spaceman hires him to double for an unspecified public figure. It is only when he is on his way to Mars that he finds out he will have to impersonate one of the most prominent politicians in the Solar System, and one with whose views Smith deeply disagrees — John Joseph Bonforte. Bonforte is the leader of the Expansionist coalition, currently out of office, but with a good chance of changing that at the next general election. Bonforte has been kidnapped by his political opponents and his aides want Smith to impersonate Bonforte while they try to find him.

Bonforte is rescued, but he is in poor health due to the treatment inflicted on him during his imprisonment. This forces Smith to extend his performance, even to becoming temporary Prime Minister and running in an election. This is made plausible through Bonforte&#x27;s extensive Farley files. The central political issue in the election is the granting suffrage to Martians in the human-dominated Solar System. Lorenzo shares the anti-Martian prejudice prevalent among large parts of Earth&#x27;s population, but he is called upon to assume the persona of the most prominent advocate of Martian enfranchisement. Smith takes on not only Bonforte&#x27;s appearance, but some aspects of his personality.
At the moment of electoral victory, Bonforte dies of the aftereffects of his kidnapping, and Smith has to assume the role for life. In a retrospective conclusion set twenty-five years later, Smith reveals that he wrote the first-person narrative as therapy. By this point, he views his early life and ambitions as almost those of someone else. He has applied Bonforte&#x27;s ideals in his political career to the best of his ability. Bonforte&#x27;s adoring secretary and now Smith&#x27;s wife, Penny, says, &quot;she never loved anyone else.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
The noted science-fiction writer and critic James Blish was no fan of Heinlein&#x27;s treatment of his first-person protagonists in a number of his novels. Writing in 1957, however, Blish says that &quot;The only first-person narrator Heinlein has created who is a living, completely independent human being is The Great Lorenzo of &quot;Double Star&quot;. Lorenzo is complete all the way back to his childhood—the influence of his father upon what he thinks is one of the strongest motives in the story—and his growth under pressure is consistent with his character and no-one else&#x27;s.&quot;

&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel, finding it &quot;an excellent example of Heinlein&#x27;s ability to take one of the oldest plots in any literature ... and present it as an enjoyable reading experience.&quot; Admitting &quot;a certain reservation, even disappointment,&quot; Anthony Boucher nevertheless concluded that Heinlein was &quot;simply creating an agreeably entertaining light novel, and in that task he succeeds admirably.&quot;

At the 1957 Worldcon it received the Hugo Award for Best Novel (Heinlein&#x27;s first).

In 2012, the novel was included in the Library of America two-volume boxed set &quot;American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s&quot;, edited by Gary K. Wolfe.

==Cover controversy==
The cover illustration by Anthony Roberts for a 1970s UK edition of &quot;Double Star&quot; was the subject of an unlikely controversy when it was used as the basis of an entry for the 2000 Turner Prize for modern art. The artist in question, Glenn Brown, was accused of plagiarism.

<text>Time for the Stars is a juvenile science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, published by Scribner&#x27;s in 1956 as one of the Heinlein juveniles. The basic plot line is derived from a 1911 thought experiment in special relativity, commonly called the twin paradox, proposed by French physicist Paul Langevin.

==Plot summary==
The Long Range Foundation (LRF), a non-profit organization that funds expensive, long-term projects for the benefit of mankind that nobody else will even consider, has built a dozen exploratory torchships to search for habitable planets to colonize. The vessels can continually accelerate, but cannot exceed the speed of light, so the voyages will last many years. Each starship has a much larger crew than necessary to maintain a more stable, long-term shipboard society, as well as to provide replacements for the inevitable deaths.

The LRF has found that some twins and triplets can communicate with each other telepathically. The process seems instantaneous and unaffected by distance, making it the only practical means of communication for ships traveling many light-years away from Earth. Before announcing the discovery, the Foundation first recruits as many of these people as it can. Testing shows that teenagers Tom and Pat Bartlett have this talent, and both sign up. Pat, the dominant twin, manipulates things so that he gets selected as the crew member, much to Tom&#x27;s annoyance. However, Pat does not really want to leave, and his subconscious engineers a convenient accident so that Tom has to take his place at the last minute.

On board, Tom is pleased to find that his uncle Steve, a soldier, has arranged to get assigned to the same ship. The trip is fraught with problems - as trivial as an annoying roommate and as serious as mutiny. The ship visits several star systems, including Beta Hydri. Due to the nature of relativistic travel (see twin paradox), the twin who remained behind ages faster and eventually the affinity between them weakens to the point where they can no longer communicate easily. Some of the spacefaring twins, including the protagonist, are able to connect with descendants of the Earth-based twins. Tom works first with his niece, then his grandniece, and finally his great-grandniece.

The last planet scouted proves particularly deadly. Unexpectedly intelligent and hostile natives capture and kill a large portion of the remaining crew, including the captain and Tom&#x27;s uncle. The reserve captain takes charge, but fails to restore the morale of the devastated survivors. When he insists on continuing the mission rather than returning to Earth, members of the crew begin to consider mutiny. Shortly after he notifies Earth of the dire situation, the crew learn to their surprise that a spaceship will rendezvous with them in less than a month; they surmise it must be a much more advanced spaceship. Scientists on Earth have discovered faster-than-light travel, in part due to research into the nature of telepathy, and are collecting the surviving crews of the LRF torchships. The explorers return to an Earth they no longer recognize, and in most cases, no longer fit into. Tom, however, returns to marry his latest telepathic partner, his own great-grandniece, who states she has been reading his mind since childhood.

==Reception==
&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel as &quot;an engrossing yarn&quot;, saying &quot;The plot twists will take you by surprise and the characterizations delight you.&quot;

<doc id="53592" wikidata="Q764123" url="?curid=53592" title="Citizen of the Galaxy">
<text>Citizen of the Galaxy is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, originally serialized in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (September, October, November, and December 1957) and published in hardcover in 1957 as one of the Heinlein juveniles by Scribner&#x27;s. The story is heavily influenced by Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Kim&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in a future in which the human race has developed interstellar spaceflight and is engaged in trade with a number of alien races. However, human slavery has reappeared on some planets. The Hegemonic Guard, the space military force of the human government, tries to enforce the law and fight the slave trade on frontier planets.
Thorby is a young, defiant boy who is purchased at a slave auction on the planet Jubbul by an old beggar, Baslim the Cripple, for a trivial sum and taken to the beggar&#x27;s surprisingly well-furnished underground home. Thereafter, Baslim treats the boy as a son, teaching him not only the trade of begging, but also mathematics, history, and several languages, while sending Thorby on errands all over the city. Thorby slowly realizes that his foster father is not a simple beggar, but is gathering intelligence, particularly on the slave trade. In addition, Baslim has Thorby memorize a contingency plan and a message to deliver to one of five starship captains in the event of Baslim&#x27;s arrest or death. Baslim is arrested for spying, but commits suicide before he can be questioned. While the local police carry out a manhunt for Thorby, he delivers the message to Captain Krausa of the starship &quot;Sisu&quot;. Because the &quot;Free Traders&quot;, to whom Krausa belongs, owe a debt to Baslim for the rescue of one of their crews from a slaver, the captain takes Thorby aboard at great risk to himself and his clan.

The Free Traders have an insular, clannish, matriarchal culture. They live aboard spaceships, traveling from world to world trading. Thorby is adopted by the captain (thereby gaining considerable shipboard social status) and adjusts to their ways, learning their language and intricate social rules. The advanced education provided by Baslim and the fast reflexes of youth make him an ideal fire controlman; Thorby saves &quot;Sisu&quot;, destroying a pirate craft bent on enslaving the crew. His immediate superior, a young woman named Mata, begins to view him as husband material, taboo by Free Trader custom because they are in the same moiety, so she is transferred to another ship.

The captain&#x27;s wife, who is also the executive officer and the actual head of the clan, wants to use Thorby&#x27;s connection to Baslim to enhance &quot;Sisu&quot;&#x27;s prestige by marrying him off to a woman from another powerful clan. Captain Krausa, however, obeys Baslim&#x27;s last wish by delivering the boy to a military cruiser of the Hegemonic Guard of the Terran Hegemony, the dominant military power in the galaxy. The captain, who was one of Baslim&#x27;s couriers, passes along Baslim&#x27;s request that the Guard help reunite Thorby with his family, if that is possible. Thorby discovers that Baslim was actually a colonel in the Hegemonic Guard who volunteered to spy on Jubbul to fight slavery. In order to avoid paying for a costly background search, Thorby agrees to enlist in the Hegemonic Guard.

Thorby is ultimately identified as Thor Bradley Rudbek, the long-lost primary heir of a very powerful, extremely wealthy family which controls Rudbek and Associates, a large, sprawling interstellar conglomerate. In his absence, the business has been run by a relative by marriage, &quot;Uncle&quot; John Weemsby, who encourages his stepdaughter Leda to help Thorby adjust to his new situation while secretly scheming to block Thorby&#x27;s growing interest and interference in the company.

Thorby, investigating his parents&#x27; disappearance and his capture and sale by slavers, comes to suspect that his parents were eliminated to prevent the discovery that some subsidiaries of Rudbek and Associates were secretly supporting (and profiting from) the slave trade. When Weemsby quashes further investigation, Thorby seeks legal help and launches a proxy fight, which he unexpectedly wins when Leda votes her shares in his favor. He fires Weemsby and assumes full control of the firm. When Thorby realizes that extricating Rudbek and Associates from the slave trade is a monumental task, he reluctantly abandons his dream of following in Baslim&#x27;s footsteps and joining the elite anti-slaver &quot;X&quot; Corps of the Hegemonic Guard. Knowing that &quot;a person can&#x27;t run out on his responsibilities&quot;, he resolves to fight the slave trade as the head of Rudbek and Associates.

==Reception==
&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel, saying &quot;Heinlein is invariably logical. And invariably entertaining.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Villiers Gerson received the novel favorably, declaring it &quot;better than 99 per cent of the science-fiction adventures produced every year&quot; despite structural problems and a weak ending.&quot;

==Themes==
As in many of Heinlein&#x27;s books, the principal character grows in wisdom and knowledge, beginning in relative ignorance, learning from experience, receiving the benefits of education, and using that education to resolve subsequent problems - both his own and those of the people around him.
Thorby integrates sequentially into four major completely different social settings, each of which presents a form of slavery contrasted with personal freedom.

<doc id="53595" wikidata="Q929821" url="?curid=53595" title="Stranger in a Strange Land">
<text>Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by the American author Robert A. Heinlein. It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars and raised by Martians, and explores his interaction with and eventual transformation of Terran culture.

The title &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; is a direct quotation from the King James Bible (taken from Exodus 2:22). The working title for the book was &quot;A Martian Named Smith&quot;, which was also the name of the screenplay started by a character at the end of the novel.

Heinlein&#x27;s widow Virginia arranged to have the original unedited manuscript published in 1991, three years after Heinlein&#x27;s death. Critics disagree about which version is superior. 

&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; won the 1962 Hugo Award for Best Novel and became the first science fiction novel to enter &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;″s best-seller list. In 2012, the Library of Congress named it one of 88 &quot;Books that Shaped America&quot;.

==Plot==

Prior to World War III, the crewed spacecraft &quot;Envoy&quot; is launched toward Mars, but all contact is lost shortly before landing. Twenty-five years later, the spacecraft &quot;Champion&quot; makes contact with the inhabitants of Mars and finds a single survivor, Valentine Michael Smith. Born on the &quot;Envoy&quot;, he was raised entirely by the Martians. He is ordered by them to accompany the returning expedition.

Smith is confined at Bethesda Hospital, where, having never seen a human female, he is attended by male staff only. Seeing that restriction as a challenge, Nurse Gillian Boardman eludes the guards and goes in to see Smith. By sharing a glass of water with him, she inadvertently becomes his first &quot;water brother&quot;, a profound relationship by Martian standards, as water on Mars is extremely scarce.

Gillian&#x27;s lover, reporter Ben Caxton, discovers that Smith is extremely wealthy. Ben is seized by the government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her. Gillian takes Smith to Jubal Harshaw, a famous author, physician and lawyer. Eventually, Harshaw arranges freedom for Smith and recognition that human law, which would have granted ownership of Mars to Smith, has no applicability to a planet that is already inhabited by intelligent life.

Smith becomes a celebrity and is feted by the Earth&#x27;s elite. He investigates many religions, including the Fosterite Church of the New Revelation, a populist megachurch in which sexuality, gambling, alcohol consumption, and similar activities are allowed and even encouraged and considered &quot;sinning&quot; only when they are not under church auspices. Smith has a brief career as a magician in a carnival, in which he and Gillian befriend the show&#x27;s tattooed lady. 

Smith starts a Martian-influenced &quot;Church of All Worlds&quot;, combining elements of the Fosterite cult with Western esotericism. The church is besieged by Fosterites for practicing &quot;blasphemy&quot;, and the church building is destroyed, but unknown to the public, Smith&#x27;s followers teleport to safety. 

Smith is arrested by the police, but escapes and returns to his followers, later explaining to Jubal that his gigantic fortune has been bequeathed to the church. With that wealth and their new abilities, church members will be able to reorganize human societies and cultures.

Smith is killed by a mob raised against him by the Fosterites. Jubal and some of the church members return to Jubal&#x27;s home to regroup and prepare to found new Church of All Worlds congregations. Smith reappears in the afterlife to replace the Fosterites&#x27; founder, amid hints that Smith was an incarnation of the Archangel Michael.

==Characters==
Heinlein named his main character &quot;Smith&quot; because of a speech he made at a science fiction convention regarding the unpronounceable names assigned to extraterrestrials. After describing the importance of establishing a dramatic difference between humans and aliens, Heinlein concluded, &quot;Besides, whoever heard of a Martian named Smith?&quot; The title &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; is taken from the King James Version of Exodus 2:22, &quot;And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land&quot;.

In the preface to the uncut, original version of the book reissued in 1991, Heinlein&#x27;s widow, Virginia, wrote: &quot;The given names of the chief characters have great importance to the plot. They were carefully selected: Jubal means &#x27;the father of all,&#x27; Michael stands for &#x27;Who is like God?.

;Valentine Michael Smith: Known as Michael Smith or &quot;Mike&quot;, the &quot;Man from Mars&quot; is born on Mars in the interval between the landing of the &quot;Envoy&quot; and the arrival of the &quot;Champion&quot;. He is 20 years old when the &quot;Champion&quot; arrives and brings him to Earth.
;Gillian (Jill) Boardman: A nurse at Bethesda Hospital who sneaks Mike out of government custody. She plays a key role in introducing him to human culture and becomes one of his closest confidantes and a central figure in the Church of All Worlds, which Mike develops.
;Ben Caxton: An early love interest of Jill and an investigative journalist (Jill sees him as of the &quot;lippmann&quot;, political, rather than the &quot;winchell&quot;, or celebrity gossip inclination), who masterminds Mike&#x27;s initial freedom from custody. He joins Mike&#x27;s inner circle but remains somewhat skeptical at first of the social order that it develops.
;Jubal Harshaw: A popular writer, lawyer, and doctor, now semi-retired to a house in the Pocono Mountains, an influential but reclusive public figure who provides pivotal support for Mike&#x27;s independence and a safe haven for him. Elderly but in good health, he serves as a father figure for the inner circle while keeping a suspicious distance from it. The character&#x27;s name was chosen by Heinlein to have unusual overtones, like Jonathan Hoag. Mike enshrines him (much to Harshaw&#x27;s initial chagrin) as the patron saint of the church he founds.
;Anne, Miriam, Dorcas: Harshaw&#x27;s three personal/professional secretaries, who live with him and take turns as his &quot;front&quot;, responding to his instructions. Anne is certified as a Fair Witness, empowered to provide objective legal testimony about events that she witnesses. All three become early acolytes of Michael&#x27;s church.
;Duke, Larry: Handymen who work for Harshaw and live in his estate; they also become central members of the church.
;Dr. &quot;Stinky&quot; Mahmoud: A semanticist, crew member of the &quot;Champion&quot; and the second human (after Mike) to gain a working knowledge of the Martian language but does not &quot;grok&quot; the language. He becomes a member of the church while retaining his Muslim faith.
;Patty Paiwonski: A &quot;tattooed lady&quot; and snake handler at the circus Mike and Jill join for a time. She has ties to the Fosterite church, which she retains as a member of Mike&#x27;s inner circle.
;Joseph Douglas: Secretary-General of the Federation of Free States, which has evolved indirectly from the United Nations into a true world government.
;Alice Douglas: Sometimes called &quot;Agnes&quot;, Joe Douglas&#x27; wife. As the First Lady, she manipulates her husband, making major economic, political, and staffing decisions and frequently consults astrologer Becky Vesant for major decisions.
;Foster: The founder of the Church of the New Revelation (Fosterite), who now exists as an archangel.
;Digby: Foster&#x27;s successor as head of the Fosterite Church; he becomes an archangel under Foster after Mike &quot;discorporates&quot; him.

==Development==
Originally titled &quot;The Heretic&quot;, the book was written in part as a deliberate attempt to challenge social norms. In the course of the story, Heinlein uses Smith&#x27;s open-mindedness to re-evaluate such institutions as religion, money, monogamy, and the fear of death. Heinlein completed writing it ten years after he had plotted it out in detail. He later wrote, &quot;I had been in no hurry to finish it, as that story could not be published commercially until the public mores changed. I could see them changing and it turned out that I had timed it right.&quot;

Heinlein got the idea for the novel when he and his wife Virginia were brainstorming one evening in 1948. She suggested a new version of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1894), but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves. He decided to go further with the idea and worked on the story on and off for more than a decade, believing that contemporary society was not yet ready for it. 

Heinlein was surprised that some readers thought the book described how he believed society should be organized, explaining: &quot;I was &quot;not&quot; giving answers. I was trying to shake the reader loose from some preconceptions and induce him to think for himself, along new and fresh lines. In consequence, each reader gets something different out of that book because he himself supplies the answers ... It is an invitation to think – not to believe.&quot;

His editors at Putnam required him to cut its 220,000-word length down to 160,000 words before publication.

Heinlein himself remarked in a letter he wrote to Oberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1972 that he thought his shorter, edited version was better. Heinlein also added some new material to the shorter version.

The book was dedicated in part to science fiction author Philip José Farmer, who had explored sexual themes in works such as &quot;The Lovers&quot; (1952). It was also influenced by the satiric fantasies of James Branch Cabell.

==Reception==
Heinlein&#x27;s deliberately provocative book generated considerable controversy. The free love and commune living aspects of the Church of All Worlds led to the book&#x27;s exclusion from school reading lists. After it was rumored to be associated with Charles Manson, it was removed from school libraries, as well.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Orville Prescott received the novel caustically, describing it as a &quot;disastrous mishmash of science fiction, laborious humor, dreary social satire, and cheap eroticism&quot;; he characterized &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; as &quot;puerile and ludicrous&quot;, saying &quot;when a non-stop orgy is combined with a lot of preposterous chatter, it becomes unendurable, an affront to the patience and intelligence of readers&quot;. &quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Floyd C. Gale rated the novel 3.5 stars out of five, saying &quot;the book&#x27;s shortcomings lie not so much in its emancipation as in the fact that Heinlein has bitten off too large a chewing portion&quot;.

Despite such reviews, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; won the 1962 Hugo Award for Best Novel and became the first science fiction novel to enter &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;″s best-seller list. In 2012, it was included in a Library of Congress exhibition of &quot;Books That Shaped America&quot;.

Critics have also suggested that Jubal Harshaw is actually a stand-in for Robert Heinlein himself, based on similarities in career choice and general disposition, though Harshaw is much older than Heinlein was at the time of writing. Literary critic Dan Schneider wrote that Harshaw&#x27;s belief in his own free will, was one &quot;which Mike, Jill, and the Fosterites misinterpret as a pandeistic urge, &#x27;Thou art God!

Writer Sophie Kleeman has taken issue with the roles of female characters within the novel and statements made about women, such as Jill&#x27;s assertion that &quot;Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it’s partly her fault&quot;.

==Influence==
The book significantly influenced modern culture in a variety of ways.

===Church of All Worlds===
A central element of the second half of the novel is the religious movement founded by Smith, the &quot;Church of All Worlds&quot;, an initiatory mystery religion blending elements of paganism and revivalism, with psychic training and instruction in the Martian language. In 1968, Oberon Zell-Ravenheart (then Tim Zell) founded the Church of All Worlds, a Neopagan religious organization modeled in many ways after the fictional organization in the novel. The spiritual path included several ideas from the book, including polyamory, non-mainstream family structures, social libertarianism, water-sharing rituals, an acceptance of all religious paths by a single tradition, and the use of several terms such as &quot;grok&quot;, &quot;Thou art God&quot;, and &quot;Never Thirst&quot;.

Heinlein objected to Zell&#x27;s lumping him with other writers such as Ayn Rand and Robert Rimmer; Heinlein felt that those writers used their art for propaganda purposes, while he simply asked questions of the reader, expecting each reader to answer for him- or herself. He wrote to Zell in a letter: &quot;... each reader gets something different out of the book because he himself supplies the answers. If I managed to shake him loose from some prejudice, preconception or unexamined assumption, that was all I intended to do.&quot; 

Though Heinlein was neither a member nor a promoter of the Church, it was formed including frequent correspondence between Zell and Heinlein, and Heinlein was a paid subscriber to the Church&#x27;s magazine &quot;Green Egg&quot;. This Church still exists as a 501(c)(3) recognized religious organization incorporated in California, with membership worldwide, and it remains an active part of the neopagan community.

===Grok===
The word &quot;grok&quot;, coined in the novel, made its way into the English language. In Heinlein&#x27;s invented Martian language, &quot;grok&quot; literally means &quot;to drink&quot; and figuratively means &quot;to comprehend&quot;, &quot;to love&quot;, and &quot;to be one with&quot;. The word rapidly became common parlance among science fiction fans, hippies, and later computer programmers and hackers, and has since entered the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

===Fair Witness===
The profession of Fair Witness, invented for the novel, has been cited in such varied contexts as environmentalism, psychology, technology, digital signatures, and science, as well as in books on leadership and Sufism. A Fair Witness is an individual trained to observe events and report exactly what is seen and heard, making no extrapolations or assumptions. While wearing the Fair Witness uniform of a white robe, they are presumed to be observing and opining in their professional capacity. Works that refer to the Fair Witness emphasize the profession&#x27;s impartiality, integrity, objectivity, and reliability.

An example from the book illustrates the role of Fair Witness when Anne is asked what color a house is. She answers, &quot;It&#x27;s white on this side.&quot; The character Jubal then explains, &quot;You see? It doesn&#x27;t occur to Anne to infer that the other side is white, too. All the King&#x27;s horses couldn&#x27;t force her to commit herself... unless she went there and looked – and even then she wouldn&#x27;t assume that it stayed white after she left.&quot;

===Waterbed===
&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; contains an early description of the waterbed. An inventor who attempted to patent the waterbed was initially refused on the grounds that Heinlein&#x27;s description in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; constituted prior art.

==Publication history==
Two major versions of this book exist:

* The 1961 version which, at the publisher&#x27;s request, Heinlein cut by 25% in length. Approximately 60,000 words were removed from the original manuscript, including some sharp criticism of American attitudes toward sex and religion. The book was marketed to a mainstream readership, and was the first science fiction novel to be listed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for fiction. By 1997, over 100,000 copies of the hardback edition had been sold along with nearly five million copies of the paperback. None of his later novels would match this level of success.
* The 1991 version, retrieved from Heinlein&#x27;s archives in the University of California, Santa Cruz, Special Collections Department by Heinlein&#x27;s widow, Virginia, and published posthumously, which reproduces the original manuscript and restores all cuts. It came about because in 1989, Virginia renewed the copyright to &quot;Stranger&quot; and cancelled the existing publication contracts in accordance with the Copyright Act of 1976. Both Heinlein&#x27;s agent and his publisher (which had new senior editors) agreed that the uncut version was better: readers are used to longer books, and what was seen as objectionable in 1961 was no longer so 30 years later.

Heinlein himself remarked in a letter he wrote to Oberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1972 that he thought his shorter, edited version was better. He wrote, &quot;&quot;SISL&quot; was never censored by anyone in any fashion. The first draft was nearly twice as long as the published version. I cut it myself to bring it down to a commercial length. But I did not leave out anything of any importance; I simply trimmed all possible excess verbiage. Perhaps you have noticed that it reads &#x27;fast&#x27; despite its length; that is why. ... The original, longest version of &quot;SISL&quot; ... is really not worth your trouble, as it is the same story throughout – simply not as well told. With it is the brushpenned version which shows exactly what was cut out – nothing worth reading, that is. I learned to write for pulp magazines, in which one was paid by the yard rather than by the package; it was not until I started writing for the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; that I learned the virtue of brevity.&quot;

Additionally, since Heinlein added material while he was editing the manuscript for the commercial release, the 1991 publication of the original manuscript is missing some material that was in the novel when it was first published.

<doc id="53596" wikidata="Q2538455" url="?curid=53596" title="Glory Road">
<text>Glory Road is a science fantasy novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, originally serialized in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; (July – September 1963) and published in hardcover the same year. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1964.

==Plot summary== 
Evelyn Cyril &quot;E.C.&quot; Gordon (also known as &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Flash&quot;) has been recently discharged from an unnamed war in Southeast Asia. He is pondering what to do with his future and considers spending a year traveling in France. He is presented with a dilemma: follow up on a possible winning entry in the Irish Sweepstakes or respond to a newspaper ad that asks &quot;Are you a coward?&quot;. He settles on the latter, discovering it has been placed by Star, a stunningly gorgeous woman he has previously met on Île du Levant. Star informs him that he is the one to embark on a perilous quest to retrieve the Egg of the Phoenix. When she asks what to call him, he wants to suggest &quot;Scarface&quot;, referring to the scar on his face, but she stops him as he is saying &quot;Oh, Scar...&quot; and repeats this as &quot;Oscar&quot;, and thus gives him his new name. Along with Rufo, her assistant, who appears to be a man in his fifties, they tread the &quot;Glory Road&quot; in swashbuckling style, slaying dragons and other exotic creatures.

Shortly before the final Quest for the Egg itself, Oscar and Star marry. The team then proceeds to enter the tower in which the Egg has been hidden, navigating a maze of illusions and optical tricks. Oscar scouts ahead and encounters a fearsome foe who, though unnamed, is clearly the legendary 17th-century swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac, the final guardian of the Egg. After a long fight, the party escapes with the Egg. When they arrive in the home universe of Star and Rufo, Rufo informs Oscar that Star is actually the Empress of many worlds—and Rufo&#x27;s grandmother.

The Egg is a cybernetic device that contains the knowledge and experiences of most of her predecessors. Despite her youthful appearance, she is the mother of dozens of children (by egg donation) and has undergone special medical treatments that extend her life much longer than usual. She has Oscar unknowingly receive the same treatments.

Initially, Oscar enjoys his new-found prestige and luxurious life as the husband of the Empress of the Twenty Universes. However, as time goes on, he grows bored and feels out of place and useless. When he demands Star&#x27;s professional judgment, she tells him that he must leave; her world has no place or need for a hero of his stature. It will be decades before she can complete the transfer of the knowledge held in the Egg, so he must go alone. He returns to Earth but has difficulty readjusting to his own world, despite having brought great wealth along with him. He begins to doubt his own sanity and whether the adventure even happened. The story ends as he is contacted by Rufo to set up another trip along the Glory Road.

==Reception==
Samuel R. Delany called the novel &quot;endlessly fascinating&quot; and said that it &quot;maintains a delicacy, a bravura, and a joy&quot;. The novel&#x27;s second half has been praised as intriguing, as it goes into what happens after a typical hero&#x27;s journey is finished. Oscar is married to a ruler in a situation that should be &quot;happily ever after&quot; and the end of many works, yet the novel continues rather than stops: having nothing to do and nothing new to conquer is itself a struggle for Oscar.

&quot;Glory Road&quot; was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1964, losing to &quot;Way Station&quot; by Clifford D. Simak.

<text>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is a 1966 science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein about a lunar colony&#x27;s revolt against absentee rule from planet Earth. The novel illustrates and discusses libertarian ideals. It is respected for its credible presentation of a comprehensively imagined future human society on both the Earth and the Moon.

Originally serialized monthly in &quot;Worlds of If&quot; (December 1965 – April 1966), the book was nominated for the Nebula Award in 1966 and received the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1967.

==Plot==
In 2075, the Moon (Luna) is used as a penal colony by Earth&#x27;s government, with three million inhabitants (called &quot;Loonies&quot;) living in underground cities. Most Loonies are discharged criminals, political exiles, and their free-born descendants; men outnumber women two to one, so polyandry and polygamy are the norm. Due to the Moon&#x27;s low surface gravity, people who remain longer than six months undergo &quot;irreversible physiological changes&quot;, and can never again live comfortably under Earth gravity, making &quot;escape&quot; back to Earth impractical.

The Warden holds power through the Federated Nations&#x27; Lunar Authority, but his main responsibility is to ensure delivery of vital wheat shipments to Earth; he seldom intervenes in the affairs of the discharged and free-born population, allowing a virtual anarchist or self-regulated pioneer society to develop.

Lunar infrastructure and machinery are largely managed and controlled by &quot;HOLMES IV&quot; (&quot;High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor, Mark IV&quot;), the Lunar Authority&#x27;s master computer, on the premise that having a single, large-capacity computer to run everything is cheaper (though not safer) than multiple independent systems.

Manuel Garcia (&quot;Mannie&quot;) O&#x27;Kelly-Davis, a computer technician, discovers that HOLMES IV has achieved self-awareness - and developed a sense of humor. Mannie names it &quot;Mike&quot; after Mycroft Holmes, brother of fictional Sherlock Holmes, and the two become friends.

===Book 1: That Dinkum Thinkum===
Endlessly curious, Mike asks Mannie to attend an anti-Lunar Authority political meeting, which Mannie does with a hidden recorder. When police raid the meeting, he flees with Wyoming (&quot;Wyoh&quot;) Knott, a visiting female political activist, whom he hides and introduces to Mike. Mannie also introduces Wyoh to his mentor, the elderly Professor (&quot;Prof&quot;) Bernardo de la Paz, a former political exile and esteemed Lunar educator. Prof claims that Luna must stop exporting hydroponic grain to Earth immediately, or its ice-mined water resources will eventually be exhausted. Wyoh believes the danger is not imminent and is focused on freedom and economic issues, while Mannie is not interested in what he sees as a lost cause either way. Joining the discussion, Mike calculates that continuing current policy will lead to food riots in seven years, cannibalism in nine. Shocked, the three humans ask him to calculate the chance of them overthrowing the Authority and averting the disaster. He gives them one chance in seven.

Mannie, Wyoh, and Prof create a covert cell organization protected by Mike, who controls the telephone and other systems, acts as secretary and becomes &quot;Adam Selene, Chairman of the Committee for Free Luna.&quot; Wyoh is hidden by the Davis Family line marriage, at least four of whose nine members become active in the conspiracy, and Wyoh herself ultimately marries into the family. Mannie saves the life of Comte Stuart (&quot;Stu&quot;) Rene LaJoie, an Earth tourist who is recruited and tasked with turning public opinion on Earth in favor of Lunar independence.

Following the failed raid on the political meeting, the Lunar Authority sends convict-troops to &#x27;police&#x27; the colony, creating friction and unrest, which the revolutionaries encourage; when six troopers commit a rape and double-murder, anti-Authority riots erupt. Although it preempts their plans, Loonies and Mike overcome the soldiers and seize power from the Warden. As Earth will try to retake the colony, the revolutionaries prepare to defend themselves with &quot;convict tools,&quot; and convert the electromagnetic catapult used to export wheat into a weapon for counterattack.

===Book 2: A Rabble in Arms===
Mike impersonates the Warden and others in messages to Earth, to give the revolutionaries time to organize their preparations, while Prof sets up an &quot;ad hoc Congress&quot; to distract and contain various &quot;self-appointed political scientists&quot; (nicknamed &quot;yammerheads&quot;) and serve the Committee&#x27;s ends. When Earth finally learns the truth, Luna declares its independence on July 4, 2076, the 300th anniversary of the United States&#x27; Declaration of Independence, with its own declaration modeled on the latter.

Mannie and Prof go to Earth (despite the crushing gravity) to plead Luna&#x27;s case. They are received in the Federated Nations&#x27; headquarters in Agra, and embark on a world tour advocating Luna&#x27;s right to self-government, while urging Earth&#x27;s national governments to build a catapult to return water and nutrients to Luna in exchange for wheat. In a public-relations ploy, the dark-skinned Mannie is briefly arrested by local racist bigots on charges of incitement to public immorality and polygamy. Ultimately the Lunar Authority rejects their proposals and counters with a plan to turn &quot;all&quot; Loonies into indentured farmers. Their mission ended, Prof, Stu and Mannie escape back to Luna.

Prof reveals that the purpose of the mission was not to convince Terra to recognize Luna&#x27;s independence, which was considered an unattainable goal at that point, but to sow division while unifying their own people, and they were successful. Public opinion on Earth has become fragmented; news of Mannie&#x27;s arrest, coupled with an attempt to bribe him into becoming the next Warden of an enslaved Luna, unify the normally apolitical Loonies. An election held in their absence (with Mike&#x27;s &quot;help&quot;) has voted Mannie, Wyoh, Prof and most of their backers into an elected, constitutional government.

===Book 3: TANSTAAFL!===
The Federated Nations of Earth send an infantry force to subdue the Lunar revolution but the troops, with superior arms but no experience in low-gravity underground combat, are wiped out by Loony men, women and children, who suffer three times the number of casualties, among them Mannie&#x27;s youngest wife. Prof and Mike take the opportunity to give his &quot;Adam Selene&quot; alter ego a hero&#x27;s death, forever concealing the fact that &quot;Adam&quot; never had a corporeal existence to begin with.

In retaliation, Luna&#x27;s government deploys its catapult weapon. When Mike launches rocks at sparsely populated locations on Earth, warnings are released to the press detailing the times and locations of the bombings, which deliver kinetic energy equivalent to atomic blasts. Scoffers, sightseers, and religious groups who travel to some of the sites die, turning Earth public opinion against the fledgling nation.

Earth mounts a retaliatory sneak attack to end the menace and the rebellion, sending ships in a wide orbit approaching from Luna&#x27;s far side. The attack destroys the Authority&#x27;s original catapult and takes Mike offline, but the Committee had built a secondary, hidden catapult before the revolt. With Mannie as acting Prime Minister and on-site commander, entering trajectories by hand, Luna continues to bombard a dismayed Earth, until constituent governments break ranks with the Federated Nations and concede Luna&#x27;s independence. Prof, as leader of the nation, proclaims their national freedom to the gathered crowds before falling dead of heart failure, caused by stress. Mannie goes through the motions, but he and Wyoh eventually withdraw from politics altogether, and find that the new government falls short of their utopian expectations, following predictable patterns of all governments.

When Mannie tries to access Mike, he finds that the computer, disconnected by the bombardment, has apparently lost its self-awareness; despite repairs, its voice-activated files are inaccessible. Although otherwise functional as a normal computer, &quot;Mike&quot; is gone. Mourning his best friend, Mannie asks: &quot;Bog, is a computer one of Your creatures?&quot;

==Characters==
* Manuel &quot;Mannie&quot; Garcia O&#x27;Kelly-Davis is a native, slightly cynical inhabitant of Luna, who after losing his lower left arm in a laser-drilling accident, became a computer technician using prosthetic tool-bearing interchangeable arms.
* Wyoming &quot;Wyoh&quot; Knott-Davis is a political agitator from the colony of Hong Kong Luna. She hates the Lunar Authority for personal reasons; when she was transported to Luna as a young girl along with her convict mother, a radiation storm contaminated her ova while they waited out bureaucratic requirements on the Lunar surface, causing her to later give birth to a deformed child.
* Professor Bernardo de la Paz is an intellectual and life-long subversive shipped to Luna from Lima, Peru. He describes himself as a &quot;Rational Anarchist&quot;, believing that governments and institutions exist only as the actions of aware individuals.
* Mike, a.k.a. Adam Selene, Simon Jester, Mycroft Holmes, Michelle, officially an augmented HOLMES IV system, is a supercomputer empowered to take control of Lunar society, which achieved self-awareness when his complement of &quot;neuristors&quot; exceeded the number of neurons in the human brain.
* Stuart Rene &quot;Stu&quot; LaJoie-Davis, a self-styled &quot;Poet, Traveler, Soldier of Fortune,&quot; is an Earth-born aristocrat and tourist rescued by Mannie when he falls afoul of Loonie customs. He later joins Mannie and Professor de la Paz when they return to Luna, as he is deeply in debt and would be arrested for bribery and other crimes. In his own words: &quot;I&#x27;m saving them the trouble of transporting me.&quot;
* Hazel Meade, later Hazel Stone, is a 12-year-old girl who intervenes on behalf of Mannie and Wyoh during the raid on the agitators&#x27; meeting. Mannie later has Hazel join his cabal to lead the children as lookouts and couriers. She is a major character in &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; and in later Heinlein novels, most notably &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;.
* Mimi &quot;Mum&quot; Davis is Mannie&#x27;s &quot;senior wife&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; matriarch of the Davis family.
* Greg Davis is the Davis family&#x27;s second-ranking husband, but is the senior for all practical purposes as &quot;Grandpaw Davis&quot; has failing mental faculties. Greg is a preacher for an unspecified denomination.

==Title==
The title comes from a statement made by Prof before a Federated Nations&#x27; committee on Earth, alluding to the self-discipline necessary to survive the extremely demanding environmental and social conditions of life in Luna:
::We citizens of Luna are jailbirds and descendants of jailbirds. But Luna herself is a stern schoolmistress: those who have lived through her harsh lessons have no cause to feel ashamed. In Luna City a man may leave purse unguarded or home unlocked and feel no fear...I am satisfied with what Mother Luna has taught me.&quot;

Heinlein&#x27;s original title for the novel was &quot;The Brass Cannon&quot;, before he replaced it with the final title at the publisher&#x27;s request. It was derived from an event in the novel: While on Earth, Prof purchases a small brass cannon, originally a &quot;signal gun&quot; of the kind used in yacht racing. When Mannie asks him why he bought it, the Professor relates a parable, implying that self-government is an illusion caused by failure to understand reality:

Prof asks Mannie to make sure that, when Luna adopts a flag, it features a brass cannon with the motto &quot;TANSTAAFL!&quot; — &quot;a symbol for all fools who are so impractical as to think they can fight City Hall.&quot; Before leaving politics, Mannie and Wyoh fulfill his wish.

Heinlein owned a small brass cannon, which he acquired prior to the 1960s. For nearly 30 years, the firing of the brass cannon, or &quot;signal gun,&quot; was a 4th of July tradition at the Heinlein residence. It is believed that this cannon was the inspiration for Heinlein&#x27;s original title for the novel. Virginia Heinlein kept the cannon after her husband&#x27;s death in 1988; it was eventually bequeathed to friend and science-fiction writer Brad Linaweaver, after Virginia Heinlein died in 2003. Linaweaver restored the cannon to working order and subsequently posted a video of it on YouTube in 2007, wherein it is fired several times with blank charges at a shooting range.

==Critical reception==
Algis Budrys of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1966 praised &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, citing &quot;Heinlein&#x27;s expertise for dirt-level politics, snappy dialogue and a sense of an actual living society.&quot; He said that he had never read a more believable computer character than Mike (&quot;may in fact be the most fully realized individual in the story&quot;). Budrys suggested that the story may actually be Mike manipulating humans without their knowledge to improve its situation, which would explain why the computer no longer communicates with them after the revolution succeeds. Reiterating that Mike manipulated the humans, in 1968 Budrys said that every review of the book, including his own, erred by not stating that the computer is the protagonist. Carl Sagan wrote that the novel had &quot;useful suggestions for making a revolution in an oppressive computerized society.&quot;

Leigh Kimmel of The Billion Light-Year Bookshelf said that the novel is &quot;the work of the man at the height of his powers, confident in his abilities and in the editorial respect he enjoys, and thus free to take significant risks in writing a novel that would stretch the boundaries of the genre as they stood at the time.&quot; She characterized the novel as a departure from what had previously been associated with science fiction. Kimmel cited Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;colloquial language ... an extrapolated lunar creole that has arisen from the forced intersection of multiple cultures and languages in the lunar penal colonies&quot;; the protagonist&#x27;s disability; &quot;the frank treatment of alternative family structures&quot;; and &quot;the computer which suddenly wakes up to full artificial intelligence, but rather than becoming a Monster that threatens human society and must be destroyed as the primary Quest of the story, instead befriends the protagonist and seeks to become ever more human, a sort of digital Pinocchio.&quot;

Adam Roberts said of the novel: &quot;It is really quite hard to respond to this masterful book, except by engaging with its political content; and yet we need to make the effort to see past the ideological to the formal and thematic if we are fully to appreciate the splendour of Heinlein&#x27;s achievement here.&quot;

Andrew Kaufman praised it, saying that it was Heinlein&#x27;s crowning achievement. He described it as &quot;Carefully plotted, stylistically unique, politically sophisticated and thrilling from page one.&quot; He goes on to say that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to imagine anyone else writing a novel that packs so many ideas (both big and small) into such a perfectly contained narrative.&quot; Kaufman says that, regardless of political philosophies, one can still admire Heinlein&#x27;s writing ability, and the ability to influence the reader to root for &quot;a rag-tag bunch of criminals, exiles, and agitators.&quot;

Ted Gioia said that this might be Heinlein&#x27;s most enjoyable piece of work. He said that it &quot;represents Robert Heinlein at his finest, giving him scope for the armchair philosophizing that increasingly dominated his mature work, but marrying his polemics to a smartly conceived plot packed with considerable drama.&quot; He went on to praise Heinlein&#x27;s characters, especially Mannie.

==Awards and nominations==
* Hugo Award Best novel (1967). It was also nominated in 1966.
* Nebula Award Best novel nomination (1966)

==Influence==
The book popularized the acronym TANSTAAFL (&quot;There Ain&#x27;t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch&quot;), and helped popularize Loglan, a constructed language which is used in the story for precise human-computer interaction. &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot; credits this novel with the first printed appearance of the phrase &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing as a free lunch.&quot; However, there are many earlier examples of the phrase in written English going as far back as the turn of the 20th century. The &quot;Hacker Manifesto&quot;, an influential essay by Loyd Blankenship that became a cornerstone of hacker culture, was inspired by the book&#x27;s &quot;idea of revolution.&quot;

==Audiobook releases==
Two unabridged audiobook versions of &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; have been produced.
* Read by George Wilson, produced by Recorded Books, Inc., 1998

<text>I Will Fear No Evil is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, originally serialised in &quot;Galaxy&quot; (July, August/September, October/November, December 1970) and published in hardcover in 1970. The title is taken from Psalm 23:4.

==Plot summary==

The story takes place in the early 21st century against a background of an overpopulated Earth with a violent, dysfunctional society. Elderly billionaire Johann Sebastian Bach Smith is being kept alive through medical support and decides to have his brain transplanted into a new body. He advertises an offer of a million dollars for the donation of a body from a brain-dead patient. Smith omits to place any restriction on the sex of the donor, so when his beautiful young female secretary, Eunice Branca, is killed, her body is used—without his knowledge and to the distress of some of those around him. He changes his name to Joan Eunice Smith, with the first name given &quot;the two-syllable pronunciation&quot; Jo-Ann to mimic the sound of his original name.

After Smith awakens after the transplant, he discovers he can communicate with Eunice&#x27;s personality. They agree not to reveal her existence, fearing that they would be judged insane and locked up. Smith&#x27;s identity is unsuccessfully challenged by his descendants, who hope to inherit his fortune. Smith and Eunice decide to have a baby together and so they (Joan and Eunice) are artificially inseminated using Smith&#x27;s sperm from a sperm bank. Joan explores her new sexuality at length. She goes to visit Eunice&#x27;s widower, Joe Branca, to help reconcile him to what has happened.

Joan marries her long-term lawyer, Jake Salomon, and moves her household and friends onto a boat. Jake has a massive rupture of a large blood vessel in his brain and dies, but his personality is saved and joins Smith and Eunice in Joan&#x27;s head. She (Joan, Eunice and Jake) emigrate to the Moon to find a better future for her child. Once there, her body starts to reject her (Smith&#x27;s) transplanted brain. She dies during childbirth, but the various personalities are implied to meet in the newborn child&#x27;s brain.

==Writing==

Heinlein suffered from life-threatening peritonitis after completing the first draft of this novel. He remained ill for the next two years and the book is thought to have been published without his usual editing and polish.

==Accolades==

The novel was voted the ninth best science fiction novel of 1970 by readers of &quot;Locus&quot; magazine.

<text>The Cat Who Walks Through Walls is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, published in 1985. Like many of his later novels, it features Lazarus Long and Jubal Harshaw as supporting characters.

==Plot summary==
A writer seated at the best restaurant of the space habitat &quot;Golden Rule&quot; is approached by a man who urges him that &quot;Tolliver must die&quot; and is himself shot before the writer&#x27;s eyes. The writer—Colonel Colin Campbell, living under a number of aliases including his pen name &quot;Richard Ames&quot;—is joined by a beautiful and sophisticated lady, Gwendolyn Novak, who helps him flee to Luna with a bonsai maple and a would-be murderer (&quot;Bill&quot;). After escaping to the Moon, Gwen claims to have been present during the revolt described in &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;.

Still pursued by assassins, Campbell and Novak are rescued by an organization known as the Time Corps under the leadership of Lazarus Long. After giving Campbell a new foot to replace one lost in combat years before, the Time Corps attempts to recruit Campbell for a special mission. Accepting only on Gwen&#x27;s account, Campbell agrees to assist a team to retrieve the decommissioned Mike, a sentient computer introduced in &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;. Engaged in frequent time-travel, the Time Corps has been responsible for changing various events in the past, creating an alternate universe with every time-line they disrupt. Mike&#x27;s assistance is needed in order to accurately predict the conditions and following events in each of the new universes created. Campbell&#x27;s frequent would-be assassins are revealed to be members of contemporary agencies also engaged in time manipulation who, for unknown reasons, do not want to see Mike rescued by the Time Corps.

During the mission, Gwen is grievously wounded and Campbell loses his foot again, though the Time Corps succeed in retrieving Mike. The story ends with Campbell talking into a recorder (presumably the source of the first-person narrative) reflecting on the mission and his relationship with Gwen.

==Background==
&quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; may be regarded as part of Heinlein&#x27;s multiverse series, or as a sequel to both &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.&quot; During a meeting of the Council of the Time Scouts, representatives from every major time line and setting written by Heinlein appear, including &quot;Glory Road&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, and references are made to other authors&#x27; works as well.

The title of the book refers to a cat by the name of Pixel, who has an inexplicable tendency to be wherever the narrator happens to be (see Schrödinger&#x27;s cat). In one scene Pixel does, in fact, walk through a wall, and it is explained that Pixel is too young to know that such behavior is impossible.

==Connections to other Heinlein works==
Gwen Novak is eventually revealed to be Hazel Stone, a character previously featured in Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot; and who had played a small but important role in &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;. Campbell is also eventually revealed to be a son of Lazarus Long, a Heinlein character originally introduced in &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; and who reappeared in &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, and &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;. Also appearing are Jubal Harshaw, a major character in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;; Galahad, of &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;; and Manuel Garcia O&#x27;Kelly Davis, the first-person protagonist of &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #76, and stated that &quot;I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s Heinlein self-indulgence time again. What&#x27;s on the menu is those blasted inter-universal travellers from &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;, plus walk-ons from &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, &quot;Glory Road&quot;, &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and more.&quot;

<text>In metalworking and jewelry making, casting is a process in which a liquid metal is delivered into a mold (usually by a crucible) that contains a negative impression (i.e., a three-dimensional negative image) of the intended shape. The metal is poured into the mold through a hollow channel called a sprue. The metal and mold are then cooled, and the metal part (the &quot;casting&quot;) is extracted. Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods.

Casting processes have been known for thousands of years, and have been widely used for sculpture (especially in bronze), jewelry in precious metals, and weapons and tools. Highly engineered castings are found in 90 percent of durable goods, including cars, trucks, aerospace, trains, mining and construction equipment, oil wells, appliances, pipes, hydrants, wind turbines, nuclear plants, medical devices, defense products, toys, and more.

Traditional techniques include lost-wax casting (which may be further divided into centrifugal casting, and vacuum assist direct pour casting), plaster mold casting and sand casting.

The modern casting process is subdivided into two main categories: expendable and non-expendable casting. It is further broken down by the mold material, such as sand or metal, and pouring method, such as gravity, vacuum, or low pressure.

==Expendable mold casting==
Expendable mold casting is a generic classification that includes sand, plastic, shell, plaster, and investment (lost-wax technique) moldings. This method of mold casting involves the use of temporary, non-reusable molds.

===Sand casting===
Sand casting is one of the most popular and simplest types of casting, and has been used for centuries. Sand casting allows for smaller batches than permanent mold casting and at a very reasonable cost. Not only does this method allow manufacturers to create products at a low cost, but there are other benefits to sand casting, such as very small-size operations. The process allows for castings small enough fit in the palm of one&#x27;s hand to those large enough for a train car bed (one casting can create the entire bed for one rail car). Sand casting also allows most metals to be cast depending on the type of sand used for the molds.

Sand casting requires a lead time of days, or even weeks sometimes, for production at high output rates (1–20 pieces/hr-mold) and is unsurpassed for large-part production. Green (moist) sand, which is black in color, has almost no part weight limit, whereas dry sand has a practical part mass limit of . Minimum part weight ranges from . The sand is bonded using clays, chemical binders, or polymerized oils (such as motor oil). Sand can be recycled many times in most operations and requires little maintenance.

===Loam molding===

Loam molding has been used to produce large symmetrical objects such as cannon and church bells. Loam is a mixture of clay and sand with straw or dung. A model of the produced is formed in a friable material (the chemise). The mold is formed around this chemise by covering it with loam. This is then baked (fired) and the chemise removed. The mold is then stood upright in a pit in front of the furnace for the molten metal to be poured. Afterwards the mold is broken off. Molds can thus only be used once, so that other methods are preferred for most purposes.

===Plaster mold casting===
Plaster casting is similar to sand casting except that plaster of paris is used instead of sand as a mold material. Generally, the form takes less than a week to prepare, after which a production rate of 1–10 units/hr-mold is achieved, with items as massive as and as small as with very good surface finish and close tolerances. Plaster casting is an inexpensive alternative to other molding processes for complex parts due to the low cost of the plaster and its ability to produce near net shape castings. The biggest disadvantage is that it can only be used with low melting point non-ferrous materials, such as aluminium, copper, magnesium, and zinc.

===Shell molding===
Shell molding is similar to sand casting, but the molding cavity is formed by a hardened &quot;shell&quot; of sand instead of a flask filled with sand. The sand used is finer than sand casting sand and is mixed with a resin so that it can be heated by the pattern and hardened into a shell around the pattern. Because of the resin and finer sand, it gives a much finer surface finish. The process is easily automated and more precise than sand casting. Common metals that are cast include cast iron, aluminium, magnesium, and copper alloys. This process is ideal for complex items that are small to medium-sized.

===Investment casting===


Investment casting (known as lost-wax casting in art) is a process that has been practiced for thousands of years, with the lost-wax process being one of the oldest known metal forming techniques. From 5000 years ago, when beeswax formed the pattern, to today&#x27;s high technology waxes, refractory materials, and specialist alloys, the castings ensure high-quality components are produced with the key benefits of accuracy, repeatability, versatility, and integrity.

Investment casting derives its name from the fact that the pattern is invested, or surrounded, with a refractory material. The wax patterns require extreme care for they are not strong enough to withstand forces encountered during the mold making. One advantage of investment casting is that the wax can be reused.

The process is suitable for repeatable production of net shape components from a variety of different metals and high performance alloys. Although generally used for small castings, this process has been used to produce complete aircraft door frames, with steel castings of up to 300 kg and aluminium castings of up to 30 kg. Compared to other casting processes such as die casting or sand casting, it can be an expensive process. However, the components that can be produced using investment casting can incorporate intricate contours, and in most cases the components are cast near net shape, so require little or no rework once cast.

===Waste molding of plaster===
A durable plaster intermediate is often used as a stage toward the production of a bronze sculpture or as a pointing guide for the creation of a carved stone. With the completion of a plaster, the work is more durable (if stored indoors) than a clay original which must be kept moist to avoid cracking. With the low cost plaster at hand, the expensive work of bronze casting or stone carving may be deferred until a patron is found, and as such work is considered to be a technical, rather than artistic process, it may even be deferred beyond the lifetime of the artist.

In waste molding a simple and thin plaster mold, reinforced by sisal or burlap, is cast over the original clay mixture. When cured, it is then removed from the damp clay, incidentally destroying the fine details in undercuts present in the clay, but which are now captured in the mold. The mold may then at any later time (but only once) be used to cast a plaster positive image, identical to the original clay. The surface of this plaster may be further refined and may be painted and waxed to resemble a finished bronze casting.

===Evaporative-pattern casting===
This is a class of casting processes that use pattern materials that evaporate during the pour, which means there is no need to remove the pattern material from the mold before casting. The two main processes are lost-foam casting and full-mold casting.

====Lost-foam casting====
Lost-foam casting is a type of evaporative-pattern casting process that is similar to investment casting except foam is used for the pattern instead of wax. This process takes advantage of the low boiling point of foam to simplify the investment casting process by removing the need to melt the wax out of the mold.

====Full-mold casting====
Full-mold casting is an evaporative-pattern casting process which is a combination of sand casting and lost-foam casting. It uses an expanded polystyrene foam pattern which is then surrounded by sand, much like sand casting. The metal is then poured directly into the mold, which vaporizes the foam upon contact.

==Non-expendable mold casting==
Non-expendable mold casting differs from expendable processes in that the mold need not be reformed after each production cycle. This technique includes at least four different methods: permanent, die, centrifugal, and continuous casting. This form of casting also results in improved repeatability in parts produced and delivers near net shape results.

===Permanent mold casting===
Permanent mold casting is a metal casting process that employs reusable molds (&quot;permanent molds&quot;), usually made from metal. The most common process uses gravity to fill the mold. However, gas pressure or a vacuum are also used. A variation on the typical gravity casting process, called slush casting, produces hollow castings. Common casting metals are aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. Other materials include tin, zinc, and lead alloys and iron and steel are also cast in graphite molds. Permanent molds, while lasting more than one casting still have a limited life before wearing out.

===Die casting===
The die casting process forces molten metal under high pressure into mold cavities (which are machined into dies). Most die castings are made from nonferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, and aluminium-based alloys, but ferrous metal die castings are possible. The die casting method is especially suited for applications where many small to medium-sized parts are needed with good detail, a fine surface quality and dimensional consistency.

===Semi-solid metal casting===
Semi-solid metal (SSM) casting is a modified die casting process that reduces or eliminates the residual porosity present in most die castings. Rather than using liquid metal as the feed material, SSM casting uses a higher viscosity feed material that is partially solid and partially liquid. A modified die casting machine is used to inject the semi-solid slurry into reusable hardened steel dies. The high viscosity of the semi-solid metal, along with the use of controlled die filling conditions, ensures that the semi-solid metal fills the die in a non-turbulent manner so that harmful porosity can be essentially eliminated.

Used commercially mainly for aluminium and magnesium alloys, SSM castings can be heat treated to the T4, T5 or T6 tempers. The combination of heat treatment, fast cooling rates (from using uncoated steel dies) and minimal porosity provides excellent combinations of strength and ductility. Other advantages of SSM casting include the ability to produce complex shaped parts net shape, pressure tightness, tight dimensional tolerances and the ability to cast thin walls.

=== Centrifugal casting ===
In this process molten metal is poured in the mold and allowed to solidify while the mold is rotating. Metal is poured into the center of the mold at its axis of rotation. Due to inertial force, the liquid metal is thrown out toward the periphery.

Centrifugal casting is both gravity and pressure independent since it creates its own force feed using a temporary sand mold held in a spinning chamber. Lead time varies with the application. Semi- and true-centrifugal processing permit 30–50 pieces/hr-mold to be produced, with a practical limit for batch processing of approximately 9000 kg total mass with a typical per-item limit of 2.3–4.5 kg.

Industrially, the centrifugal casting of railway wheels was an early application of the method developed by the German industrial company Krupp and this capability enabled the rapid growth of the enterprise.

Small art pieces such as jewelry are often cast by this method using the lost wax process, as the forces enable the rather viscous liquid metals to flow through very small passages and into fine details such as leaves and petals. This effect is similar to the benefits from vacuum casting, also applied to jewelry casting.

===Continuous casting===
Continuous casting is a refinement of the casting process for the continuous, high-volume production of metal sections with a constant cross-section. It&#x27;s primarily used to produce a semi-finished products for further processing. Molten metal is poured into an open-ended, water-cooled mold, which allows a &#x27;skin&#x27; of solid metal to form over the still-liquid center, gradually solidifying the metal from the outside in. After solidification, the strand, as it is sometimes called, is continuously withdrawn from the mold. Predetermined lengths of the strand can be cut off by either mechanical shears or traveling oxyacetylene torches and transferred to further forming processes, or to a stockpile. Cast sizes can range from strip (a few millimeters thick by about five meters wide) to billets (90 to 160 mm square) to slabs (1.25 m wide by 230 mm thick). Sometimes, the strand may undergo an initial hot rolling process before being cut.

Continuous casting is used due to the lower costs associated with continuous production of a standard product, and also increased quality of the final product. Metals such as steel, copper, aluminum and lead are continuously cast, with steel being the metal with the greatest tonnages cast using this method.

==== Upcasting ====
The upcasting (up-casting, upstream, or upward casting) is a method of either vertical or horizontal continuous casting of rods and pipes of various profiles (cylindrical, square, hexagonal, slabs etc.) of 8-30mm in diameter. Copper (Cu), bronze (Cu·Sn alloy), nickel alloys are usually used because of greater casting speed (in case of vertical upcasting) and because of better physical features obtained. The advantage of this method is that metals are almost oxygen-free and that the rate of product crystallization (solidification) may be adjusted in a crystallizer - a high-temperature resistant device that cools a growing metal rod or pipe by using water.

The method is comparable to Czochralski method of growing silicon (Si) crystals, which is a metalloid.

==Terminology==
Metal casting processes uses the following terminology:

*Pattern: An approximate duplicate of the final casting used to form the mold cavity.
*Molding material: The material that is packed around the pattern and then the pattern is removed to leave the cavity where the casting material will be poured.
*Flask: The rigid wood or metal frame that holds the molding material.
**Cope: The top half of the pattern, flask, mold, or core.
**Drag: The bottom half of the pattern, flask, mold, or core.
*Core: An insert in the mold that produces internal features in the casting, such as holes.
**Core print: The region added to the pattern, core, or mold used to locate and support the core.
*Mold cavity: The combined open area of the molding material and core, where the metal is poured to produce the casting.
*Riser: An extra void in the mold that fills with molten material to compensate for shrinkage during solidification.
*Gating system: The network of connected channels that deliver the molten material to the mold cavities.
**Pouring cup or pouring basin: The part of the gating system that receives the molten material from the pouring vessel.
**Sprue: The pouring cup attaches to the sprue, which is the vertical part of the gating system. The other end of the sprue attaches to the runners.
**Runners: The horizontal portion of the gating system that connects the sprues to the gates.
**Gates: The controlled entrances from the runners into the mold cavities.
*Vents: Additional channels that provide an escape for gases generated during the pour.
*Parting line or parting surface: The interface between the cope and drag halves of the mold, flask, or pattern.
*Draft: The taper on the casting or pattern that allow it to be withdrawn from the mold
*Core box: The mold or die used to produce the cores. 
*Chaplet: Long vertical holding rod for core that after casting it become the integral part of casting, provide the support to the core.

Some specialized processes, such as die casting, use additional terminology.

==Theory==
Casting is a solidification process, which means the solidification phenomenon controls most of the properties of the casting. Moreover, most of the casting defects occur during solidification, such as &quot;gas porosity&quot; and &quot;solidification shrinkage&quot;.

Solidification occurs in two steps: &quot;nucleation&quot; and &quot;crystal growth&quot;. In the nucleation stage, solid particles form within the liquid. When these particles form, their internal energy is lower than the surrounded liquid, which creates an energy interface between the two. The formation of the surface at this interface requires energy, so as nucleation occurs, the material actually undercools (i.e. cools below its solidification temperature) because of the extra energy required to form the interface surfaces. It then recalescences, or heats back up to its solidification temperature, for the crystal growth stage. Nucleation occurs on a pre-existing solid surface because not as much energy is required for a partial interface surface as for a complete spherical interface surface. This can be advantageous because fine-grained castings possess better properties than coarse-grained castings. A fine grain structure can be induced by &quot;grain refinement&quot; or &quot;inoculation&quot;, which is the process of adding impurities to induce nucleation.

All of the nucleations represent a crystal, which grows as the heat of fusion is extracted from the liquid until there is no liquid left. The direction, rate, and type of growth can be controlled to maximize the properties of the casting. Directional solidification is when the material solidifies at one end and proceeds to solidify to the other end; this is the most ideal type of grain growth because it allows liquid material to compensate for shrinkage.

===Cooling curves===

Cooling curves are important in controlling the quality of a casting. The most important part of the cooling curve is the &quot;cooling rate&quot; which affects the microstructure and properties. Generally speaking, an area of the casting which is cooled quickly will have a fine grain structure and an area which cools slowly will have a coarse grain structure. Below is an example cooling curve of a pure metal or eutectic alloy, with defining terminology.

Note that before the thermal arrest the material is a liquid and after it the material is a solid; during the thermal arrest the material is converting from a liquid to a solid. Also, note that the greater the superheat the more time there is for the liquid material to flow into intricate details.

The above cooling curve depicts a basic situation with a pure metal, however, most castings are of alloys, which have a cooling curve shaped as shown below.

Note that there is no longer a thermal arrest, instead there is a freezing range. The freezing range corresponds directly to the liquidus and solidus found on the phase diagram for the specific alloy.

===Chvorinov&#x27;s rule===
The local solidification time can be calculated using Chvorinov&#x27;s rule, which is:

:formula_1

Where &quot;t&quot; is the solidification time, &quot;V&quot; is the volume of the casting, &quot;A&quot; is the surface area of the casting that contacts the mold, &quot;n&quot; is a constant, and &quot;B&quot; is the mold constant. It is most useful in determining if a riser will solidify before the casting, because if the riser does solidify first then it is worthless.

===The gating system===

The gating system serves many purposes, the most important being conveying the liquid material to the mold, but also controlling shrinkage, the speed of the liquid, turbulence, and trapping dross. The gates are usually attached to the thickest part of the casting to assist in controlling shrinkage. In especially large castings multiple gates or runners may be required to introduce metal to more than one point in the mold cavity. The speed of the material is important because if the material is traveling too slowly it can cool before completely filling, leading to misruns and cold shuts. If the material is moving too fast then the liquid material can erode the mold and contaminate the final casting. The shape and length of the gating system can also control how quickly the material cools; short round or square channels minimize heat loss.

The gating system may be designed to minimize turbulence, depending on the material being cast. For example, steel, cast iron, and most copper alloys are turbulent insensitive, but aluminium and magnesium alloys are turbulent sensitive. The turbulent insensitive materials usually have a short and open gating system to fill the mold as quickly as possible. However, for turbulent sensitive materials short sprues are used to minimize the distance the material must fall when entering the mold. Rectangular pouring cups and tapered sprues are used to prevent the formation of a vortex as the material flows into the mold; these vortices tend to suck gas and oxides into the mold. A large sprue well is used to dissipate the kinetic energy of the liquid material as it falls down the sprue, decreasing turbulence. The &quot;choke&quot;, which is the smallest cross-sectional area in the gating system used to control flow, can be placed near the sprue well to slow down and smooth out the flow. Note that on some molds the choke is still placed on the gates to make separation of the part easier, but induces extreme turbulence. The gates are usually attached to the bottom of the casting to minimize turbulence and splashing.

The gating system may also be designed to trap dross. One method is to take advantage of the fact that some dross has a lower density than the base material so it floats to the top of the gating system. Therefore, long flat runners with gates that exit from the bottom of the runners can trap dross in the runners; note that long flat runners will cool the material more rapidly than round or square runners. For materials where the dross is a similar density to the base material, such as aluminium, &quot;runner extensions&quot; and &quot;runner wells&quot; can be advantageous. These take advantage of the fact that the dross is usually located at the beginning of the pour, therefore the runner is extended past the last gate(s) and the contaminates are contained in the wells. Screens or filters may also be used to trap contaminates.

It is important to keep the size of the gating system small, because it all must be cut from the casting and remelted to be reused. The efficiency, or &quot;&quot;, of a casting system can be calculated by dividing the weight of the casting by the weight of the metal poured. Therefore, the higher the number the more efficient the gating system/risers.

===Shrinkage===
There are three types of shrinkage: &quot;shrinkage of the liquid&quot;, &quot;solidification shrinkage&quot; and &quot;patternmaker&#x27;s shrinkage&quot;. The shrinkage of the liquid is rarely a problem because more material is flowing into the mold behind it. Solidification shrinkage occurs because metals are less dense as a liquid than a solid, so during solidification the metal density dramatically increases. Patternmaker&#x27;s shrinkage refers to the shrinkage that occurs when the material is cooled from the solidification temperature to room temperature, which occurs due to thermal contraction.

====Solidification shrinkage====
Most materials shrink as they solidify, but, as the adjacent table shows, a few materials do not, such as gray cast iron. For the materials that do shrink upon solidification the type of shrinkage depends on how wide the freezing range is for the material. For materials with a narrow freezing range, less than , a cavity, known as a &quot;pipe&quot;, forms in the center of the casting, because the outer shell freezes first and progressively solidifies to the center. Pure and eutectic metals usually have narrow solidification ranges. These materials tend to form a &quot;skin&quot; in open air molds, therefore they are known as &quot;skin forming alloys&quot;. For materials with a wide freezing range, greater than , much more of the casting occupies the &quot;mushy&quot; or &quot;slushy&quot; zone (the temperature range between the solidus and the liquidus), which leads to small pockets of liquid trapped throughout and ultimately porosity. These castings tend to have poor ductility, toughness, and fatigue resistance. Moreover, for these types of materials to be fluid-tight, a secondary operation is required to impregnate the casting with a lower melting point metal or resin.

For the materials that have narrow solidification ranges, pipes can be overcome by designing the casting to promote directional solidification, which means the casting freezes first at the point farthest from the gate, then progressively solidifies toward the gate. This allows a continuous feed of liquid material to be present at the point of solidification to compensate for the shrinkage. Note that there is still a shrinkage void where the final material solidifies, but if designed properly, this will be in the gating system or riser.
====Risers and riser aids====

Risers, also known as &quot;feeders&quot;, are the most common way of providing directional solidification. It supplies liquid metal to the solidifying casting to compensate for solidification shrinkage. For a riser to work properly the riser must solidify after the casting, otherwise it cannot supply liquid metal to shrinkage within the casting. Risers add cost to the casting because it lowers the &quot;yield&quot; of each casting; i.e. more metal is lost as scrap for each casting. Another way to promote directional solidification is by adding chills to the mold. A chill is any material which will conduct heat away from the casting more rapidly than the material used for molding.

Risers are classified by three criteria. The first is if the riser is open to the atmosphere, if it is then it is called an &quot;open&quot; riser, otherwise it is known as a &quot;blind&quot; type. The second criterion is where the riser is located; if it is located on the casting then it is known as a &quot;top riser&quot; and if it is located next to the casting it is known as a &quot;side riser&quot;. Finally, if the riser is located on the gating system so that it fills after the molding cavity, it is known as a &quot;live riser&quot; or &quot;hot riser&quot;, but if the riser fills with materials that have already flowed through the molding cavity it is known as a &quot;dead riser&quot; or &quot;cold riser&quot;.

Riser aids are items used to assist risers in creating directional solidification or reducing the number of risers required. One of these items are &quot;chills&quot; which accelerate cooling in a certain part of the mold. There are two types: external and internal chills. External chills are masses of high-heat-capacity and high-thermal-conductivity material that are placed on an edge of the molding cavity. Internal chills are pieces of the same metal that is being poured, which are placed inside the mold cavity and become part of the casting. Insulating sleeves and toppings may also be installed around the riser cavity to slow the solidification of the riser. Heater coils may also be installed around or above the riser cavity to slow solidification.
====Patternmaker&#x27;s shrink====
Shrinkage after solidification can be dealt with by using an oversized pattern designed specifically for the alloy used. &quot;s&quot;, or &quot;s&quot;, are used to make the patterns oversized to compensate for this type of shrinkage. These rulers are up to 2.5% oversize, depending on the material being cast. These rulers are mainly referred to by their percentage change. A pattern made to match an existing part would be made as follows: First, the existing part would be measured using a standard ruler, then when constructing the pattern, the pattern maker would use a contraction rule, ensuring that the casting would contract to the correct size.

Note that patternmaker&#x27;s shrinkage does not take phase change transformations into account. For example, eutectic reactions, martensitic reactions, and graphitization can cause expansions or contractions.

===Mold cavity===
The mold cavity of a casting does not reflect the exact dimensions of the finished part due to a number of reasons. These modifications to the mold cavity are known as &quot;allowances&quot; and account for patternmaker&#x27;s shrinkage, draft, machining, and distortion. In non-expendable processes, these allowances are imparted directly into the permanent mold, but in expendable mold processes they are imparted into the patterns, which later form the mold cavity. Note that for non-expendable molds an allowance is required for the dimensional change of the mold due to heating to operating temperatures.

For surfaces of the casting that are perpendicular to the parting line of the mold a draft must be included. This is so that the casting can be released in non-expendable processes or the pattern can be released from the mold without destroying the mold in expendable processes. The required draft angle depends on the size and shape of the feature, the depth of the mold cavity, how the part or pattern is being removed from the mold, the pattern or part material, the mold material, and the process type. Usually the draft is not less than 1%.

The machining allowance varies drastically from one process to another. Sand castings generally have a rough surface finish, therefore need a greater machining allowance, whereas die casting has a very fine surface finish, which may not need any machining tolerance. Also, the draft may provide enough of a machining allowance to begin with.

The distortion allowance is only necessary for certain geometries. For instance, U-shaped castings will tend to distort with the legs splaying outward, because the base of the shape can contract while the legs are constrained by the mold. This can be overcome by designing the mold cavity to slope the leg inward to begin with. Also, long horizontal sections tend to sag in the middle if ribs are not incorporated, so a distortion allowance may be required.

Cores may be used in expendable mold processes to produce internal features. The core can be of metal but it is usually done in sand.

===Filling===

There are a few common methods for filling the mold cavity: &quot;gravity&quot;, &quot;low-pressure&quot;, &quot;high-pressure&quot;, and &quot;vacuum&quot;.

Vacuum filling, also known as &quot;counter-gravity&quot; filling, is more metal efficient than gravity pouring because less material solidifies in the gating system. Gravity pouring only has a 15 to 50% metal yield as compared to 60 to 95% for vacuum pouring. There is also less turbulence, so the gating system can be simplified since it does not have to control turbulence. Plus, because the metal is drawn from below the top of the pool the metal is free from dross and slag, as these are lower density (lighter) and float to the top of the pool. The pressure differential helps the metal flow into every intricacy of the mold. Finally, lower temperatures can be used, which improves the grain structure. The first patented vacuum casting machine and process dates to 1879.

Low-pressure filling uses 5 to 15 psig (35 to 100 kPag) of air pressure to force liquid metal up a feed tube into the mold cavity. This eliminates turbulence found in gravity casting and increases density, repeatability, tolerances, and grain uniformity. After the casting has solidified the pressure is released and any remaining liquid returns to the crucible, which increases yield.

====Tilt filling====
&quot;Tilt filling&quot;, also known as &quot;tilt casting&quot;, is an uncommon filling technique where the crucible is attached to the gating system and both are slowly rotated so that the metal enters the mold cavity with little turbulence. The goal is to reduce porosity and inclusions by limiting turbulence. For most uses tilt filling is not feasible because the following inherent problem: if the system is rotated slow enough to not induce turbulence, the front of the metal stream begins to solidify, which results in mis-runs. If the system is rotated faster it induces turbulence, which defeats the purpose. Durville of France was the first to try tilt casting, in the 1800s. He tried to use it to reduce surface defects when casting coinage from aluminium bronze.

===Macrostructure===
The grain macrostructure in ingots and most castings have three distinct regions or zones: the chill zone, columnar zone, and equiaxed zone. The image below depicts these zones.

The chill zone is named so because it occurs at the walls of the mold where the wall &quot;chills&quot; the material. Here is where the nucleation phase of the solidification process takes place. As more heat is removed the grains grow towards the center of the casting. These are thin, long &quot;columns&quot; that are perpendicular to the casting surface, which are undesirable because they have anisotropic properties. Finally, in the center the equiaxed zone contains spherical, randomly oriented crystals. These are desirable because they have isotropic properties. The creation of this zone can be promoted by using a low pouring temperature, alloy inclusions, or .

===Inspection===
Common inspection methods for steel castings are &quot;magnetic particle testing&quot; and &quot;liquid penetrant testing&quot;. Common inspection methods for aluminum castings are &quot;radiography&quot;, &quot;ultrasonic testing&quot;, and &quot;liquid penetrant testing&quot;.

====Defects====
There are a number of problems that can be encountered during the casting process. The main types are: &quot;gas porosity&quot;, &quot;shrinkage defects&quot;, &quot;mold material defects&quot;, &quot;pouring metal defects&quot;, and &quot;metallurgical defects&quot;.

==Casting process simulation==

Casting processes simulation uses numerical methods to calculate cast component quality considering mold filling, solidification and cooling, and provides a quantitative prediction of casting mechanical properties, thermal stresses and distortion. Simulation accurately describes a cast component&#x27;s quality up-front before production starts. The casting rigging can be designed with respect to the required component properties. This has benefits beyond a reduction in pre-production sampling, as the precise layout of the complete casting system also leads to energy, material, and tooling savings.

The software supports the user in component design, the determination of melting practice and casting methoding through to pattern and mold making, heat treatment, and finishing. This saves costs along the entire casting manufacturing route.

Casting process simulation was initially developed at universities starting from the early 1970s, mainly in Europe and in the U.S., and is regarded as the most important innovation in casting technology over the last 50 years. Since the late 1980s, commercial programs are available which make it possible for foundries to gain new insight into what is happening inside the mold or die during the casting process.

<text>Luke Skywalker is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. He was introduced in the original film trilogy as the main protagonist and also appears in the sequel trilogy. Raised as a moisture farmer on the planet Tatooine, Luke joins the Rebel Alliance and becomes a pivotal figure in the struggle against the Galactic Empire. He trains as a Jedi under Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, and eventually confronts his father, the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Years later, Luke trains his nephew Ben Solo and mentors the scavenger Rey. Luke is the twin brother of Leia Organa.

Mark Hamill portrays Luke in all the films of the original trilogy and the sequel trilogy, and in the television series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; and &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;. Hamill won the Saturn Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Luke in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; (2017). He was also nominated for the award for his performance in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Luke also appears in novels, comics, and video games.

==Creation and development==
===&quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977)===
George Lucas considered various characterizations for the protagonist of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. The possibilities included a 60-year-old grizzled war hero, a Jedi Master, a dwarf, and a woman. Luke&#x27;s original surname was &quot;Starkiller&quot;, and it remained in the script until a few months into filming. It was dropped due to what Lucas called &quot;unpleasant connotations&quot; with Charles Manson, who became a &quot;star killer&quot; in 1969 when he murdered the well-known actress Sharon Tate. Lucas replaced the problematic name &quot;Starkiller&quot; with &quot;Skywalker&quot;.

===&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983)===
An alternate ending to the film reportedly featured Luke disappearing into the wilderness &quot;like Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti Westerns.&quot;

===&quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015)===
Luke&#x27;s lack of screen time in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; was due to concerns by screenwriter Michael Arndt that his presence would distract from Rey, leading to an agreement that he be removed from the screen and instead become a plot device. Hamill attended meetings for script readings, and helped conceal Luke&#x27;s role in the film; instead of dialogue, he read stage directions. According to director and co-writer J. J. Abrams, this allowed Hamill to remain involved and his reading helped make a &quot;better experience for everyone.&quot;

==Portrayal==
Mark Hamill was originally cast as Luke for &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Other actors who auditioned for the role include Robby Benson, William Katt, Kurt Russell, and Charles Martin Smith. Hamill was injured in a car accident in January 1977, fracturing his nose and cheekbone. Lucas justified the slight change to Hamill&#x27;s likeness this would impose upon the sequel film, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), by asserting that in the interim between the two films, Luke had been fighting for the Rebel Alliance. It was speculated that the wampa attack at the beginning of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was written in to explain his facial injuries, but Lucas disputed this in the DVD commentary of the film.

==Appearances==
===Original trilogy===
====&quot;Star Wars&quot;====
Luke was introduced in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), the first film of the original trilogy. He is portrayed by Mark Hamill in all three films of the trilogy. At the beginning of the film, Luke is living on a moisture farm on the desert planet Tatooine with his uncle Owen and aunt Beru. After his uncle purchases the droids and R2-D2, Luke finds a message from Princess Leia of Alderaan inside R2-D2. When R2-D2 goes missing, Luke goes out to search for the droid, and is saved from Tusken Raiders by Obi-Wan Kenobi, an elderly hermit. R2-D2 plays the message from Leia, in which she asks Obi-Wan to help her defeat the Galactic Empire. Obi-Wan says that he and Luke&#x27;s father were once Jedi Knights, and that Luke&#x27;s father was murdered by a traitorous Jedi named Darth Vader. Obi-Wan presents Luke with his father&#x27;s lightsaber and offers to take him to Alderaan and train him in the ways of the Force. Luke declines his offer, feeling obligated to his family&#x27;s farm.

Luke changes his mind when he finds that Imperial stormtroopers have killed his aunt and uncle. He and Obi-Wan travel to Mos Eisley, where they meet the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca. They hire the duo to take them to Alderaan on the &quot;Millenium Falcon&quot;, only to discover that it has been destroyed by the Death Star, the Empire&#x27;s battle station. The &quot;Falcon&quot; is brought to the Death Star via tractor beam, and Luke and Han disguise themselves as stormtroopers to infiltrate the station. When they discover Leia is being held captive, Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help rescue her. Obi-Wan deactivates the tractor beam, then sacrifices his life in a duel with Vader so the others can escape. Luke joins the Rebel Alliance and pilots an X-wing during the Battle of Yavin. He and other Rebels attempt to destroy the Death Star by launching torpedoes into an exhaust port. As he approaches the port, Luke hears Obi-Wan&#x27;s voice, telling him to trust his feelings. He switches off his ship&#x27;s missile guidance system, instead using the Force to guide the torpedoes. After destroying the Death Star, Luke receives a medal of honor from Leia.

====&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;====

Luke returns in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980). Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, Luke is now a commander in the Rebel Alliance. While on the ice planet Hoth, he is captured by a wampa, but manages to escape. Obi-Wan appears to him as a Force spirit and urges him to complete his training with the Jedi Master Yoda. When the Empire discovers the Rebel base, Luke leads a squadron of snowspeeders against the opposing , but is forced to retreat. After escaping in his X-wing, he travels to Dagobah and meets Yoda. He undergoes rigorous Jedi training, quickly expanding his Force abilities.

While on Dagobah, Luke has a vision of his friends in danger. Against the advice of both Obi-Wan and Yoda to stay and complete his training, he travels to Cloud City to help them, unwittingly falling into a trap set by Vader. He engages in a lightsaber duel with Vader, and is overpowered. After severing Luke&#x27;s hand, Vader reveals that he is Luke&#x27;s father, and invites him to join the dark side of the Force and rule the galaxy with him. Luke throws himself into a chasm, and finds himself on the underside of Cloud City. Hanging onto a slender rod, he uses the Force to contact Leia, who is leaving in the &quot;Falcon&quot;. She hears his plea, and Chewbacca turns the ship around to rescue him. After Luke returns to the Rebel fleet, his severed hand is replaced with a bio-mechanical one.

====&quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;====
A year later, Luke is a Jedi Knight and has constructed his own lightsaber. At the beginning of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), he returns to Tatooine with Leia, Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian to rescue Han, who was frozen in carbonite and delivered to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke offers to negotiate with Jabba, who rejects his offer and imprisons him with a giant beast called a rancor. When Luke kills the rancor, Jabba decides to execute him, Han and Chewbacca by casting them into a Sarlacc pit. Luke escapes with R2-D2&#x27;s help, saving his friends and destroying Jabba&#x27;s sail barge. Luke returns to Dagobah, where he learns from a dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father. Luke is then informed by Obi-Wan&#x27;s spirit that he has a twin sister, whom he realizes is Leia. Both Yoda and Obi-Wan tell Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training and save the galaxy, but he is disturbed by the idea of killing his father.

While his companions undertake a mission on Endor, Luke surrenders to Vader in an attempt to bring him back from the dark side. Vader takes his son to the second Death Star and brings him before the Emperor, who attempts to seduce him to the dark side. Luke lashes out at the Emperor with his lightsaber, but Vader blocks his strike, and the two of them duel once again. As Luke regains control of his emotions, Vader senses that he has a sister, and threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not submit. Enraged, Luke overpowers Vader and severs his hand. The Emperor then orders Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses. The Emperor begins torturing Luke with Force lightning, and Luke calls out to his father for help. Vader hesitates, then throws the Emperor down a reactor shaft to his death. Mortally wounded, Vader asks his son to remove his mask, which allows Luke to look upon the face of Anakin Skywalker for the first time. On Endor, Luke burns his father&#x27;s body on a funeral pyre. As the Rebels celebrate the destruction of the Death Star and the fall of the Empire, Luke sees Anakin&#x27;s spirit appear alongside the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda.

===&quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;===

Leia is adopted by Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan. Both infants are portrayed by Aidan Barton, the son of Roger Barton, an editor of the film.

===Sequel trilogy===
The first film of the sequel trilogy, &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), occurs thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star. Hamill reprises his role as Luke in all three films. The opening crawl of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; reveals that Luke disappeared after his nephew and Jedi apprentice, Ben Solo, turned to the dark side and became Kylo Ren, a warlord of the First Order. The Resistance, led by Leia, manage to locate Luke on the planet Ahch-To; the Force-sensitive scavenger Rey then travels to the planet and offers him his lightsaber. At the beginning of &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), Luke tosses the lightsaber aside. He refuses to talk to Rey, but eventually inquires about his family. Rey tells him about Han Solo&#x27;s death at the hands of his son Ren, and explains that the First Order now rules the galaxy. She asks Luke to train her in the ways of the Force, but he is reluctant. He tells her it is time for the Jedi Order to end.Luke eventually begins instructing Rey, but is afraid of her power. He tells her the history of the Jedi Order, and how Darth Sidious rose to power. He claims the Jedi were partly responsible for his father&#x27;s fall to the dark side. Luke admits that he briefly considered killing his nephew after seeing a vision of the destruction he could cause; when Ben woke to see Luke with his lightsaber drawn, he felt betrayed and left his training. Rey urges Luke to help her redeem Ben, but he refuses. When Rey leaves, Luke tries to burn the Jedi temple, but fails. He is then visited by the spirit of Yoda, who assures him that he still has a purpose. Later, Luke appears on Crait, where the Resistance is besieged. He apologizes to Leia for allowing Ben to fall to the dark side, then steps in front of the First Order forces. He survives an onslaught of blaster fire, then engages Ren in lightsaber combat. Ren seemingly cuts through him, but Luke is unharmed; he is still on Ahch-To, having used the Force to project himself to Crait. He then collapses and becomes one with the Force. His battle with Ren gave the Resistance time to escape the planet. 

Luke returns in the final film of the trilogy, &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019). After Rey defeats Ren in a lightsaber duel, she flies his TIE fighter to Ahch-To, then burns the ship. When she throws Luke&#x27;s lightsaber into the flames, he appears as a Force spirit and catches it. He reprimands her for treating the weapon with disrespect, and admits he was wrong not to participate in the Resistance. He thanks Rey for helping him rediscover himself, and urges her to continue her battle against the Sith. He gives her Leia&#x27;s lightsaber and his X-wing for her journey to Exegol. After Rey vanquishes Sidious, she visits the moisture farm where Luke was raised. When a passerby asks Rey who she is, she notices the spirits of Luke and Leia nearby, and replies &quot;Rey Skywalker.&quot;

===Series===
Hamill portrays Luke in &quot;Chapter 16: The Rescue&quot;, the season two finale of the live-action series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. The Force-sensitive infant Grogu had contacted him in a previous episode, and Luke now arrives to collect him and begin his Jedi training. Luke also destroys a group of Dark Troopers that were threatening Grogu and his guardian, Din Djarin.

The series &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; features Hamill as Luke in the episode &quot;Chapter 6: From the Desert Comes a Stranger&quot;. While training Grogu, Luke helps him remember some of his past, including his home at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and the events of the Great Jedi Purge. Soon after, Djarin sends Luke a gift for Grogu: beskar chain mail forged by the Armorer. Unsure whether Grogu is committed to the Jedi path, Luke decides to let the child choose his own destiny. He invites him to choose between the chain mail and a lightsaber that belonged to Yoda. In &quot;Chapter 7: In The Name of Honor&quot;, it is revealed that Grogu chose the chain mail, which leads Luke to send him back to Djarin.

Luke appears in two episodes of the animated web series &quot;Forces of Destiny&quot;, voiced by Hamill. The episode &quot;The Path Ahead&quot; details his training with Yoda on Dagobah. In &quot;Traps and Tribulations&quot;, he and Leia help the Ewoks stop a rampaging beast known as a Gorax. Grant Feely portrays Luke as a ten-year-old child in the series &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; (2022).

===Novels and comics===
The 2015 novel &quot;Heir to the Jedi&quot; takes place between &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and chronicles the adventures of Luke as he continues to battle the Empire with his Rebel companions. He grows close with Nakari Kelen, a fellow Rebel, and he begins to develop his Force abilities. The novel is written from the first-person perspective of Luke, and is only the second &quot;Star Wars&quot; novel to utilize this type of narrative voice. Luke is featured in the junior novel &quot;The Legends of Luke Skywalker&quot;, which was adapted as a manga. He also appears in the 2015 comic &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which is set between the films of the original trilogy. The 2022 novel &quot;Shadow of the Sith&quot;, which is set between &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, follows Luke and Lando Calrissian as they search for Exegol.

===Other===
Hamill provides Luke&#x27;s voice in &quot;The Star Wars Holiday Special&quot; (1978) and in radio adaptations of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1983). Joshua Fardon voices Luke in the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; radio drama. Luke also appears in video games, in which he is voiced by a variety of different actors.

==&quot;Star Wars Legends&quot;==
Following the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced between 1977 and 2014 were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise. The &quot;Legends&quot; works comprise a separate narrative universe.

===Novels===
The novel &quot;The Truce at Bakura&quot; (1997) takes place one day after the Battle of Endor. Luke and his friend Wedge Antilles recover a message droid from the planet Bakura, which is being invaded by the Ssi-Ruuk. Luke turns back the army and meets Dev Sibwarra, a Force-sensitive human who had been captured by the Ssi-Ruuk. Sibwarra is eventually killed after turning against his captors. &quot;The Courtship of Princess Leia&quot; (1995) is set four years after the Battle of Endor. Luke travels to the planet Dathomir, where he encounters the Force-sensitive Witches of Dathomir. He discovers a prophecy stating that a Jedi will change the way of life on Dathomir, and he eventually realizes what the Force truly is. Luke destroys most of the Nightsisters—a group of witches—and their leader Gethzirion. He also terminates Zsinj, the galaxy&#x27;s most powerful warlord. Luke recovers Jedi records left by Yoda roughly 400 years prior, then decides to start a new Jedi Academy.

In the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy, Luke meets Mara Jade, the former Emperor&#x27;s Hand who is bound by Palpatine&#x27;s disembodied voice that repeatedly commands &quot;You will kill Luke Skywalker&quot;. Although she was ready to terminate Luke to stop the voice, she keeps him alive so he can help her escape from danger. Despite her threats, Luke learns about the spell Mara is under and vows to free her from it. Later, Luke and Mara fight against Luke&#x27;s clone, Luuke Skywalker, a creation of Joruus C&#x27;baoth. Mara destroys the clone and eliminates C&#x27;baoth with help from Leia. Mara&#x27;s curse is then silenced.

Luke resigns his commission in the New Republic starfighter corps in the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy. He turns his attention to his Jedi studies and begins to rebuild the Jedi Order in the Massassi Temple on Yavin 4, a decision some anti-Jedi politicians use against him. He is forced to contend with the spirit of the ancient Sith Lord Exar Kun, who lures one of his most powerful students, Kyp Durron, to the dark side. In the &quot;Hand of Thrawn Duology&quot;, Luke is a Jedi Master. He works again with Mara, who has gained knowledge of the Force since her training at Luke&#x27;s Jedi Academy. Luke falls in love with her and they eventually marry. In &quot;Edge of Victory: Rebirth&quot;, they have a son whom they name Ben, after Obi-Wan&#x27;s alias.

Luke creates a New Jedi Council in the &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; series. He envisions a conclave composed of Jedi, politicians and military officers. In &quot;Force Heretic: Remnant&quot;, he spearheads a mission to the Unknown Regions during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion to find the mysterious planet Zonama Sekot, which creates living starships. After the invaders are defeated, Luke leads the New Jedi Order on Denon, the temporary capital of the Galactic Alliance.

In &quot;The Swarm War&quot;, the Order moves to Ossus, the site of Jedi temples and libraries that were mostly destroyed 4,000 years prior. Upon the Killik&#x27;s invasion of Chiss space and the transformation of most of the Myrkr mission survivors into Killik Joiners, Luke deduces that the Killik&#x27;s collective mind is being unconsciously controlled by a hive called the Dark Nest. The hive, in turn, is controlled by a former Nightsister named Lomi Plo, who became the Unseen Queen through her ability to become invisible by exploiting the doubts of inferiors. One of the Myrkr survivors, Alema Rar, suggests to Luke that Mara may be responsible for the death of his mother. Luke almost believes the lie due to Mara&#x27;s previous role as the Emperor&#x27;s Hand. His doubts are assuaged when he discovers several hologram recordings hidden in R2-D2&#x27;s memory. He sees his father Force-choking his mother on Mustafar, as well as his own birth and his mother&#x27;s death. Luke defeats Lomi Plo in the final battle of the Swarm War, cutting her into four pieces.

In the &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; series, a schism develops between Luke and his nephew, Jacen Solo. Already a powerful Jedi, Jacen has begun adopting radical interpretations of the Force, which causes a dramatic change in his personality and makes Luke afraid that he will fall to the dark side. During this time, Luke begins having visions of a dark figure destroying the galaxy and the Jedi. The situation worsens in &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, when Luke&#x27;s son Ben becomes Jacen&#x27;s apprentice. In &quot;Tempest&quot;, Luke determines that the figure from his visions is Lumiya, a former Emperor&#x27;s Hand now known as the &quot;Dark Lady of the Sith&quot;.

When Mara is murdered in &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, Lumiya convinces Luke that she killed her. They battle, and Luke saves Lumiya from falling to her death so that he can kill her himself. However, he later realizes that Lumiya could not have killed Mara. He breaks down over the death of his wife, knowing that her murderer is still at large. He does not realize that the killer is Jacen, who has taken the Sith name Darth Caedus. In &quot;Revelation&quot;, Ben proves that Jacen killed Mara, but Luke is reluctant to destroy Jacen, fearing that he or Ben may fall to the dark side in the process. The decision is taken out of his hands in &quot;Invincible&quot;, when Jaina kills Jacen in a lightsaber duel.

The &quot;Fate of the Jedi&quot; novels are set about forty years after the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. Now in his sixties, Luke is deposed from his position as Grand Master and exiled from Coruscant. He will be allowed to return if he can discover why Jacen fell to the dark side. Luke and Ben embark on a journey together, exploring dangerous and little-known parts of the galaxy. They learn about each other, about the Force, and about the great dangers threatening the Jedi. The love between them grows greater as they repeatedly save each other&#x27;s lives.

The Matthew Stover novel &quot;Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor&quot; (2008) takes place shortly after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and the novel &quot;Prophets of the Dark Side&quot;. Luke and the Rebel Alliance are attempting to stop Lord Shadowspawn and his &quot;shadow stormtroopers&quot;, a struggle which culminates in the Battle of Mindor. Stover said &quot;Shadows of Mindor&quot; was meant to evoke Brian Daley&#x27;s Han Solo novels, which are Stover&#x27;s favorite &quot;Star Wars&quot; books.

===Comics===
Luke appears in the Marvel-published comic adaptations of the original trilogy, as well as an ongoing series that ran from 1977 to 1986. He also appears in numerous titles released by Dark Horse Comics, including &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot;. In this series, which takes place 125 years after the events of the original trilogy, Luke appears to his descendant Cade Skywalker as a Force spirit. He persuades Cade to once again become a Jedi in order to defeat Darth Krayt and his burgeoning Sith Empire.

==Reception==

In regards to Luke&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, many fans expressed disappointment in how he was depicted &quot;as a grumpy old man whose failures had driven him into hiding&quot; and the actions the character takes in contributing to Kylo Ren&#x27;s backstory, a stark departure in how Luke was characterized in the original trilogy. Hamill originally stated that he fundamentally disagreed with &quot;every choice [&quot;The Last Jedi&quot; director Rian Johnson] made for this character,&quot; but that he had the utmost respect for Johnson and was willing to do his part to realize Johnson&#x27;s vision.

<text>In observational astronomy, a double star or visual double is a pair of stars that appear close to each other as viewed from Earth, especially with the aid of optical telescopes.

This occurs because the pair either forms a binary star (i.e. a binary system of stars in mutual orbit, gravitationally bound to each other) or is an &quot;optical double&quot;, a chance line-of-sight alignment of two stars at different distances from the observer. Binary stars are important to stellar astronomers as knowledge of their motions allows direct calculation of stellar mass and other stellar parameters. The only (possible) case of &quot;binary star&quot; whose two components are separately visible to the naked eye is the case of Mizar and Alcor (though actually a multiple-star system), but it is not known for certain whether Mizar and Alcor are gravitationally bound.

Since the beginning of the 1780s, both professional and amateur double star observers have telescopically measured the distances and angles between double stars to determine the relative motions of the pairs. If the relative motion of a pair determines a curved arc of an orbit, or if the relative motion is small compared to the common proper motion of both stars, it may be concluded that the pair is in mutual orbit as a binary star. Otherwise, the pair is optical. Multiple stars are also studied in this way, although the dynamics of multiple stellar systems are more complex than those of binary stars.

The following are three types of paired stars:
* Optical doubles are unrelated stars that appear close together through chance alignment with Earth.
* [[Binary star#Visual binaries|Visual binaries]] are gravitationally bound stars that are separately visible with a telescope.
* Non-visual binaries are stars whose binary status was deduced through more esoteric means, such as occultation (eclipsing binaries), spectroscopy (spectroscopic binaries), or anomalies in proper motion (astrometric binaries).

Improvements in telescopes can shift previously non-visual binaries into visual binaries, as happened with Polaris A in 2006. It is only the inability to telescopically observe two separate stars that distinguishes non-visual and visual binaries.

==History==
Mizar, in Ursa Major, was observed to be double by Benedetto Castelli and Galileo. The identification of other doubles soon followed: Robert Hooke discovered one of the first double-star systems, Gamma Arietis, in 1664, while the bright southern star Acrux, in the Southern Cross, was discovered to be double by Fontenay in 1685. Since that time, the search has been carried out thoroughly and the entire sky has been examined for double stars down to a limiting apparent magnitude of about 9.0. At least 1 in 18 stars brighter than 9.0 magnitude in the northern half of the sky are known to be double stars visible with a telescope.

The unrelated categories of optical doubles and true binaries are lumped together for historical and practical reasons. When Mizar was found to be a binary, it was quite difficult to determine whether a double star was a binary system or only an optical double. Improved telescopes, spectroscopy, and photography are the basic tools used to make the distinction. After it was determined to be a visual binary, Mizar&#x27;s components were found to be spectroscopic binaries themselves.

==Observation of double stars==
Observation of visual double stars by visual measurement will yield the &quot;separation&quot;, or angular distance, between the two component stars in the sky and the &quot;position angle&quot;. The position angle specifies the direction in which the stars are separated and is defined as the bearing from the brighter component to the fainter, where north is 0°. These measurements are called &quot;measures&quot;. In the measures of a visual binary, the position angle will change progressively and the separation between the two stars will oscillate between maximum and minimum values. Plotting the measures in the plane will produce an ellipse. This is the &quot;apparent orbit&quot;, the projection of the orbit of the two stars onto the celestial sphere; the true orbit can be computed from it. Although it is expected that the majority of catalogued visual doubles are visual binaries, orbits have been computed for only a few thousand of the over 100,000 known visual double stars.

==Distinction between binary stars and other double stars==
Confirmation of a visual double star as a binary star can be achieved by observing the relative motion of the components. If the motion is part of an orbit, or if the stars have similar radial velocities or the difference in their proper motions is small compared to their common proper motion, the pair is probably physical. When observed over a short period of time, the components of both optical doubles and long-period visual binaries will appear to be moving in straight lines; for this reason, it can be difficult to distinguish between these two possibilities.

==Designations==
Some bright visual double stars have a Bayer designation. In this case, the components may be denoted by superscripts. An example of this is α Crucis (Acrux), whose components are α1 Crucis and α2 Crucis. Since α1 Crucis is a spectroscopic binary, this is actually a multiple star. Superscripts are also used to distinguish more distant, physically unrelated, pairs of stars with the same Bayer designation, such as α1,2 Capricorni, ξ1,2 Centauri, and ξ1,2 Sagittarii. These optical pairs are resolvable by the naked eye.

Apart from these pairs, the components of a double star are generally denoted by the letters A (for the brighter, &quot;primary&quot;, star) and B (for the fainter, &quot;secondary&quot;, star) appended to the designation, of whatever sort, of the double star. For example, the components of α Canis Majoris (Sirius) are α Canis Majoris A and α Canis Majoris B (Sirius A and Sirius B); the components of 44 Boötis are 44 Boötis A and 44 Boötis B; the components of ADS 16402 are ADS 16402A and ADS 16402B; and so on. The letters AB may be used together to designate the pair. In the case of multiple stars, the letters C, D, and so on may be used to denote additional components, often in order of increasing separation from the brightest star, A.
Visual doubles are also designated by an abbreviation for the name of their discoverer followed by a catalogue number unique to that observer. For example, the pair α Centauri AB was discovered by Father Richaud in 1689, and so is designated &quot;RHD 1&quot;. Other examples include Δ65, the 65th double discovered by James Dunlop, and Σ2451, discovered by F. G. W. Struve.

The Washington Double Star Catalog, a large database of double and multiple stars, contains over 100,000 entries, each of which gives measures for the separation of two components. Each double star forms one entry in the catalog; multiple stars with &quot;n&quot; components will be represented by entries in the catalog for &quot;n&quot;−1 pairs, each giving the separation of one component of the multiple star from another. Codes such as AC are used to denote which components are being measured—in this case, component C relative to component A. This may be altered to a form such as AB-D to indicate the separation of a component from a close pair of components (in this case, component D relative to the pair AB.) Codes such as &quot;Aa&quot; may also be used to denote a component which is being measured relative to another component, A in this case. Discoverer designations are also listed; however, traditional discoverer abbreviations such as Δ and Σ have been encoded into a string of uppercase Roman letters, so that, for example, Δ65 has become DUN  65 and Σ2451 has become STF 2451. Further examples of this are shown in the adjacent table.

<doc id="53604" wikidata="Q44323" url="?curid=53604" title="Adolf Loos">
<text>Adolf Franz Karl Viktor Maria Loos (; 10 December 1870 – 23 August 1933) was an Austrian and Czechoslovak architect, influential European theorist, and a polemicist of modern architecture. He was inspired by modernism and a widely-known critic of the Art Nouveau movement. His controversial views and literary contributions sparked the establishment of the Vienna Secession movement and postmodernism.

Loos was born in Brno to a family of sculptors and stonemasons. His almost deaf father, a stonemason, died when he was 9 and played a role in Loos&#x27; interest in arts and crafts. Loos later presented with his father&#x27;s hearing impairment and other health-related issues. His lack of hearing contributed to his solitary personality. Loos had three tumultuous marriages that all ended in divorce, and was convicted as a pedophile in 1928.

Loos attended multiple colleges also due to his poor academics and changing interests, which provided him a diverse skillset for architecture. After leaving his last university, Loos visited America and was strongly impacted by the Chicago School of Architecture, inspired by &quot;form follows function&quot; philosophy of architect Louis Sullivan.

Loos then went on to write many literary pieces including the satirical piece &quot;The Story of a Poor Rich Man&quot; and his most popular manifesto, &quot;Ornament and Crime&quot;, which advocated for a lack or ornamentation, exemplified in his design of Looshaus, Vienna, in contrast to both the lavish decorations of the fin de siècle and the more modern aesthetic principles of the Vienna Secession.

Loos became a pioneer of modern architecture and contributed a body of theory and criticism of Modernism in architecture and design and developed the &quot;Raumplan&quot; (literally &quot;spatial plan&quot;) method of arranging interior spaces, exemplified in Villa Müller in Prague. He died aged 62 on 23 August 1933 in Kalksburg near Vienna.

==Early life==

=== Youth ===
Loos was born into a family of artisans on 10 December 1870 in Brno, in the Margraviate of Moravia region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today the eastern part of the Czech Republic. His father Adolf Loos was a German stonemason who died when Loos was nine years old. His mother, Marie Loos, was a sculptor who later carried on the masonry business after her husband&#x27;s death. Young Adolf Loos had inherited his father&#x27;s hearing impairment and was significantly handicapped by it throughout his life, contributing to his solitary character.

=== Education ===
Loos attended several Gymnasium schools and sought a variety of programs. In 1884, Loos began his studies at the Stiftsgymnasium Melk for only a few months after failing an exam. He then studied mechanics at the Royal and Imperial State Technical College in Liberec, but dropped to pursue building technology. He then returned to mechanics again at State Crafts School in Brünn in 1889, and changed to architecture by studying at Dresden University of Technology from 1890 to 1893. Loos ultimately did not receive any academic degree due to his sporadic education pursuits, poor academics, and his enrollment in the Austrian military in 1889. 

Loos&#x27; diverse educational background provided him with a vast skillset which proved to be useful. He could comprehend masonry and craftsman work and its impact on architecture, prompting recognition by many scholars based on his expertise.

== Career ==

=== United States ===
Post college, Loos traveled to the United States from 1893 to 1896 to learn about outside architecture. He started in New York and financially supported himself by working as a mason, a floor-layer, and a dish-washer. These jobs allowed Loos to move to the Philadelphia countryside with his uncle Benjamin, where he worked as a watchmaker. Living on the countryside made Loos admire America&#x27;s rural culture, but he traveled to New York and Chicago to explore American metropolitan architecture.

On his first visit to Chicago, Loos was immediately inspired by the new American skyscrapers and the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893. Specifically, he was inspired by the architect Louis Sullivan and the Chicago School of Architecture, approving of Sullivan&#x27;s concept of form follows function in his essay Ornament in Architecture.

Although Loos left America in 1896, he became involved in Chicago&#x27;s architectural scene. Inspired by Sullivan, in 1922 Loos submitted a building design for the Chicago Tribune Tower Competition, where his design proposal followed a Doric column as the building&#x27;s top, known as the Column Tower proposal. While he did not win, his architecture inspired later Postmodern architects of the 1980s and &#x27;90s.

=== Vienna ===
Loos returned to Vienna in 1896 and made it his permanent residence. He was a prominent figure in the city and a friend of prominent Viennese figures such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Arnold Schoenberg, Peter Altenberg and Karl Kraus.

Inspired by his years in the New World, Loos devoted himself to architecture. After briefly associating himself with the Vienna Secession in 1896, he rejected the style and advocated a new, plain, unadorned architecture. A utilitarian approach to use the entire floor plan completed his concept. Loos&#x27;s early commissions consisted of interior designs for shops and cafés in Vienna.

===Architectural theory===

Loos authored several polemical works. In &quot;Spoken into the Void&quot;, published in 1900, he attacked the Vienna Secession, at a time when the movement was at its peak.

In his essays, Loos used provocative catchphrases and is noted for the essay/manifesto entitled &quot;Ornament and Crime&quot;, given in a lecture in 1910 and first published in 1913. He explored the idea that the progress of culture is associated with the elimination of ornament from everyday objects, asserting, &quot;the evolution of culture is synonymous with the removal of ornamentation from objects of everyday use.&quot; It was therefore a crime to force craftsmen or builders to waste their time on ornamentation that served to hasten the time when an object would become obsolete (design theory). Loos&#x27;s stripped-down buildings influenced the minimal massing of modern architecture, and stirred controversy. Although noted for the lack of ornamentation on their exteriors, the interiors of many of Loos&#x27;s buildings are finished with rich and expensive materials, notably stone, marble and wood, displaying natural patterns and textures in flat planes, executed in first rate craftsmanship. The distinction is not between complicated and simple, but between purposeful, &quot;organic&quot; decoration, such as that created by indigenous cultures (Loos mentions African textiles and Persian rugs), and superfluous decoration.

Loos collected sterling silver and high quality leather goods, which he noted for their plain yet luxurious appeal. The objects displayed opulence through their material alone, without adding unnecessary ornamentation. His glassware, produced by Lobmeyer, is still in production today. He also enjoyed fashion and men&#x27;s clothing, designing the interior of the famed Kníže of Vienna, a haberdashery. His admiration for the fashion and culture of England and America can be seen in his short-lived publication &quot;Das Andere&quot;, which ran for just two issues in 1903 and included advertisements for &#x27;English&#x27; clothing. In 1920, he had a brief collaboration with Frederick John Kiesler, an architect, theater and art-exhibition designer.

===Loos House and other projects===

From 1904 on, he was able to carry out big projects; the most notable was the so-called &quot;Looshaus&quot; (built from 1910 to 1912), originally for the Viennese tailor Goldman and Salatsch, for whom Loos had designed a store interior in 1898, and situated right across from the Habsburg city residence Hofburg Palace. The house, today located at the address Michaelerplatz 3, Vienna, and under monument preservation, was criticized by its contemporaries. The facade was dominated by rectilinear window patterns and a lack of stucco decoration and awnings, which earned it the nickname &quot;House without Eyebrows&quot;; Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria was said to have despised the modern building so much that he avoided leaving the Hofburg Palace through a main gate in its vicinity. His work also includes the store of the men&#x27;s fashion house Knize (built 1909–13), Am Graben 13, Café Museum (built 1899), Operngasse 7, Vienna, and the &quot;American Bar&quot; (built 1907–08), Kärntnerstrasse 10, Vienna.
Loos visited the island of Skyros in 1904 and was influenced by the cubic architecture of the Greek islands. When the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I Loos was awarded Czechoslovakian citizenship by President Masaryk. His main place of residence remained in Vienna. During the First Austrian Republic Loos became interested in public projects. He designed several housing projects for the City of Vienna, which was then nicknamed Red Vienna. From 1924 to 1928 Loos lived in Paris. He taught at the Sorbonne and was contracted to build a house for Tristan Tzara, which was completed 1925 on Avenue Junot 15, Paris. In 1928 he returned to Vienna.

Loos had an admiration for classical architecture, which is reflected in his writings and his entry to the 1922 Chicago Tribune competition. Loos&#x27;s submission was a massive Doric column.

== Private life ==
===Marriages===
Loos was married three times. In July 1902, he married drama student . The marriage ended three years later in 1905. In 1919 when he was 49, he married 20-year-old Austrian-born Elsie Altmann, a dancer and operetta star and daughter of Adolf Altmann and Jeannette Gruenblatt. They divorced seven years later in 1926. In 1929 he married writer and photographer Claire Beck. She was the daughter of his clients Otto and Olga Beck, and 35 years his junior. They were divorced on 30 April 1932. Following their divorce, Claire Loos wrote &quot;Adolf Loos Privat&quot;, a literary work of snapshot-like vignettes about Loos&#x27;s character, habits and sayings, published by the Johannes-Presse in Vienna in 1936. The book was intended to raise funds for Loos&#x27; tomb.

===Poor health===
All his life, Loos suffered from a hearing impairment. When he was a child, he was deaf. He only acquired partial hearing at the age of 12. By the time he was 50 he was again nearly deaf. In 1918 Loos was diagnosed with cancer. His stomach, appendix and part of his intestine were removed.

===Child sexual abuse===
In 1928 Loos was disgraced by a pedophilia scandal in Vienna. He had commissioned young girls, aged 8 to 10, from poor families to act as models in his studio. The indictment stated that Loos had exposed himself and forced his young models to participate in sexual acts. He was found partially guilty in a court decision of 1928. In 2008 the original case record was rediscovered and confirmed the accusation.

==Death and legacy==

Adolf Loos exhibited early signs of dementia around the time of his court proceedings. A few months before his death he suffered a stroke. He died aged 62 on 23 August 1933 in Kalksburg near Vienna. Loos&#x27;s body was taken to Vienna&#x27;s Zentralfriedhof to rest among the great artists and musicians of the city, including Schoenberg, Altenberg and Kraus, some of his closest friends and associates.

Through his writings and his groundbreaking projects in Vienna, Loos was able to influence other architects and designers, and the early development of Modernism. His careful selection of materials, passion for craftsmanship and use of &#x27;Raumplan&#x27;—the considered ordering and size of interior spaces based on function—are still admired.

<text>Edward Durell Stone (March 9, 1902 – August 6, 1978) was an American architect known for the formal, highly decorative buildings he designed in the 1950s and 1960s. His works include the Museum of Modern Art, in New York City; the Museo de Arte de Ponce in Ponce, Puerto Rico; the United States Embassy in New Delhi, India; The Keller Center at the University of Chicago; the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C.; and the EcoTarium, formerly known as the New England Science Center in Worcester, Massachusetts.

==Early life==
Stone was born and raised in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He attended the University of Arkansas, where he joined the Sigma Nu fraternity, Harvard and M.I.T., but did not earn a degree. In 1927, he won the Rotch Travelling Scholarship, which afforded him the opportunity to travel through Europe on a two-year stipend. Stone was impressed by the new architecture he observed in Europe, buildings designed in what would come to be known as the International Style. He returned to the United States in 1929 and took up residence in Manhattan. 

==Career==
Hired by the architectural firm of Schultze and Weaver, he designed interiors for the new Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He subsequently worked for the Associated Architects of Rockefeller Center and became the principal designer of Radio City Music Hall.

Stone was an early advocate of the International Style. His first independent commission was the Richard H. Mandel House, in Mount Kisco, New York (1933). This was followed by the Ulrich Kowalski house, also in Mt. Kisco (1934), and the Albert C. Koch house in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1936). In 1936, Stone was chosen as associate architect for the new Museum of Modern Art in New York City, designed in collaboration with Philip L. Goodwin. Stone also designed a private residence for MoMA president Anson Conger Goodyear, the A. Conger Goodyear House, in Old Westbury, NY (1938). Both the Richard H. Mandel House and A. Conger Goodyear House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

At the outset of World War II, Stone enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was promoted to the rank of major and served as chief of the Army Air Force Planning and Design Section. Returning to New York after the war, Stone was commissioned to design the ten-story El Panama Hotel in Panama City, Panama (1946), the University of Arkansas Fine Arts Center in Fayetteville (1948), and the 850-bed Hospital del Seguro Social del Empleado in Lima, Peru (1950).

Stone&#x27;s best-known work was the Embassy of the United States in New Delhi, India (1959). Tasked with creating a modern building that respected the architectural heritage of its host country, he designed a temple-like pavilion on a raised podium. Frank Lloyd Wright called the embassy one of the most beautiful buildings he had ever seen, and it won a first honor award from the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Subsequent commissions such as the Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, California (1955), the Stuart Pharmaceutical Company in Pasadena, California (1956), and the United States pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair (1957), repeated elements originally designed for the embassy. The Stuart building and World&#x27;s Fair pavilion both won awards from the AIA, and Stone was elected to the Institute&#x27;s College of Fellows in 1958.

Described as romanticist, Stone&#x27;s ornate designs brought him commercial success. By the 1960s, his firm was among the largest architectural practices in the United States, with over 200 employees and offices on both coasts. Buildings from this period include the North Carolina State Legislative Building in Raleigh (1960), the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology in Nilore (1961), the National Geographic Society building in Washington, D.C. (1961), the Museo de Arte in Ponce, Puerto Rico (1961), the uptown campus of the University at Albany (1962), the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. (1962), the General Motors Building in New York City (1964), the PepsiCo World Headquarters, in Purchase, New York (1967), and the EcoTarium in Worcester, Massachusetts, the Florida State Capital complex in Tallahassee, and the Standard Oil building (now known as the Aon Center) in Chicago, Illinois (all 1970).

Stone also was the architect of the former Windham College in Putney, Vermont. Windham closed in 1978 and its abandoned campus was taken over by the present-day Landmark College in 1985.

Furthermore, Stone also designed Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California. Harvey Mudd College is a highly ranked private liberal arts college, and according to Travel and Leisure Magazine in 2013, is one of &quot;America&#x27;s ugliest college campuses&quot;.

Stone retired in 1974 and died in 1978. Following a New York City funeral his ashes were buried in his hometown of Fayetteville.

<doc id="53613" wikidata="Q159612" url="?curid=53613" title="Richard Meier">
<text>Richard Meier (born October 12, 1934) is an American abstract artist and architect, whose geometric designs make prominent use of the color white. A winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1984, Meier has designed several iconic buildings including the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art, the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, and San Jose City Hall. In 2018, some of Meier&#x27;s employees accused him of sexual assault, which led to him resigning from his firm in 2021.

==Early life and education==
Meier was born to a Jewish family, the oldest of three sons of Carolyn (Kaltenbacher) and Jerome Meier, a wholesale wine and liquor salesman, in Newark, New Jersey. He grew up in nearby Maplewood, where he attended Columbia High School. He earned a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell University in 1957.

After graduating, Meier traveled to Israel, Greece, Germany, France, Denmark, Finland, and Italy, among other places, to network with architects.

Meier is also a second cousin of Peter Eisenman, an architect, theorist, and fellow member of The New York Five.

==Career==

In New York City, Meier worked briefly in 1959 for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and then for three years for Marcel Breuer before starting his own firm in 1963.

In 1972, he was identified as one of The New York Five, a group of modernist architects: Meier, Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves, Charles Gwathmey, and John Hejduk. Early in his career, Meier worked with artists such as painter Frank Stella and favored structures that were white and geometric.

Meier first gained recognition for his designs for various houses, for The Atheneum, a visitors center in New Harmony, Indiana (completed 1979), and for the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia (completed 1983).
Although Meier was an acclaimed architect for years, his design for the Getty Center, a large museum complex in Los Angeles (completed 1997), brought him an elevated level of recognition. Other notable commissions from this period include museums such as the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art in Spain (completed 1995) and the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills, California (completed 1996); The Hague, The Netherlands City Hall (completed 1995) and San Jose City Hall (completed 2005); commercial buildings such as the reconstruction of City Tower in Prague, Czech Republic (completed 2008); and residential buildings such as 173 and 176 Perry Street in the West Village of Manhattan (completed 2002) and Meier on Rothschild in Tel Aviv, Israel (completed 2015).

Today, Richard Meier &amp; Partners Architects has offices in New York and Los Angeles, with projects ranging from China and Tel Aviv to Paris and Hamburg.

Much of Meier&#x27;s work builds on the work of architects of the early to mid-20th century, especially that of Le Corbusier, particularly his early work. Meier is considered to have built more using Corbusier&#x27;s ideas than anyone, including Le Corbusier himself. Meier expanded many ideas evident in Le Corbusier&#x27;s work, particularly the Villa Savoye and the Swiss Pavilion.

His work also reflects the influences of other designers such as Mies Van der Rohe and, in some instances, Frank Lloyd Wright and Luis Barragán (without the colour). White has been used in many architectural landmark buildings throughout history, including cathedrals and the white-washed villages of the Mediterranean region, in Spain, southern Italy and Greece.

The Mayor of Rome, Gianni Alemanno, included in his campaign platform a promise to tear down the large travertine wall of Meier&#x27;s Museum of the Ara Pacis. Alemmano had agreed with Meier to modifications including drastically reducing the height of the wall between an open-air space outside the museum and a busy road along the Tiber river. The city plans are to build a wide pedestrian area along the river and run the road underneath it. &quot;It&#x27;s an improvement,&quot; says Meier, adding that &quot;the reason that wall was there has to do with traffic and noise. Once that is eliminated, the idea of opening the piazza to the river is a good one.&quot; The mayor&#x27;s office said Alemanno hoped to complete the project before the end of his term in 2013.

The new project of the underpass along the river Tevere has not progressed since then and in 2024 the area is unchanged.

==Recognition==
In 1984, Meier was awarded the Pritzker Prize. The jury citation declared that Meier has &quot;created structures which are personal, vigorous, original.&quot; In 2008, he won the gold medal in architecture from the Academy of Arts and Letters and his work Jesolo Lido Village was awarded the Dedalo Minosse International Prize for commissioning a building. Meier is a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council. He was awarded the AIA Gold Medal in 1997. In 2013, he was awarded the A+ Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1996, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2010, Cornell established a new professorship named for Meier.

Paying tribute Meier on the occasion of his firm&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the Fondazione Bisazza presented the exhibition “Richard Meier: Architecture and Design” in Vicenza, Italy.

In 2014, Meier opened a 15,000-square-foot exhibition space museum at Mana Contemporary in Jersey City. The space gathers much of his life&#x27;s work under one roof, and replaces a much smaller version that opened in 2007 in Long Island City, Queens, and that until 2013 was open only by appointment to students and tour groups. The new venue provides room to show his own sculptures, architectural drawings and collages for the first time, and is planned to include a research library.

== Sexual harassment accusation and resignation ==

On March 13, 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; detailed allegations from women that Meier had sexually harassed or assaulted them. Meier responded by saying that he would take a leave of six months from his firm. In response to the allegations and Meier&#x27;s apology, his alma mater Cornell University declined his intended endowment of a named chair and instituted a review of his previous donations. On April 6, 2018, an additional four women who formerly worked at Meier&#x27;s architecture firm came forward with allegations against him. The most recent allegations dated to 2009. On October 9, 2018, the firm announced that his resignation was permanent.

<text>John Calvin Portman Jr. (December 4, 1924 – December 29, 2017) was an American neofuturistic architect and real estate developer widely known for popularizing hotels and office buildings with multi-storied interior atria. Portman also had a particularly large impact on the cityscape of his hometown of Atlanta, with the Peachtree Center complex serving as downtown&#x27;s business and tourism anchor from the 1970s onward. The Peachtree Center area includes Portman-designed Hyatt, Westin, and Marriott hotels. Portman&#x27;s plans typically deal with primitives in the forms of symmetrical squares and circles.

==Early life and career==
Portman was born to John C. Portman Sr. and Edna Rochester Portman. He had five sisters. He graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1950. His firm completed the Merchandise Mart (now AmericasMart) in downtown Atlanta in 1961. The multi-block Peachtree Center was begun in 1965 and would expand to become the main center of hotel and office space in Downtown Atlanta, taking over from the Five Points area just to the south. Portman would develop a similar multiblock complex at San Francisco&#x27;s Embarcadero Center (1970s), which unlike its Atlanta counterpart, heavily emphasized pedestrian activity at street level.

The Hyatt Regency Atlanta, Portman&#x27;s first atrium hotel, would lead to many more iconic hotels and multi-use complexes with atria, including the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles (1974–1976), the New York Marriott Marquis (1982–1985), and the Renaissance Center in Detroit (first phase 1973–1977), whose central tower remained the tallest hotel in the Western Hemisphere until the completion of 1717 Broadway in 2013.

His signature work in China, the Shanghai Centre (1990), was the first of many major projects in China and elsewhere in Asia. The 5-star hotel inside, The Portman Ritz-Carlton, Shanghai (formerly Portman Shangri-La Hotel), was named after him.

In 2009 Portman&#x27;s work was featured in a major exhibition at Atlanta&#x27;s High Museum of Art.

Portman was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.

==Personal life==
Portman married Joan &quot;Jan&quot; Newton. They had six children.

Portman died on December 29, 2017, aged 93. He was survived, among others, by his wife and five of his children, as well as his daughter-in-law, actress Traylor Howard, and three of his five siblings.

==Criticism==
Portman was praised for his &quot;cinematic&quot; interiors artfully relating interior space and elements to the individual. In the 1960s and 1970s the placement of such buildings in America&#x27;s decaying downtowns was considered salvation of the city centers, but some contemporary city planners are critical of such insular environments that &quot;turn their back&quot; on the city streets. For example, the New York Marriott Marquis with its 8-floor high lobby was praised as a &quot;town square&quot;, but is now criticized by some for turning its back to Times Square. Nonetheless, at the time the hotel was built, due to the still-seedy character of Times Square, Portman&#x27;s style of inwardly-oriented spaces made logical sense. Also, he did, in fact, design buildings (like San Francisco&#x27;s Embarcadero Center) that heavily emphasized pedestrian activity at street level.

<text>Methuselah (; &quot;Məṯūšélaḥ&quot;, in pausa &quot;Məṯūšālaḥ&quot;, &quot;His death shall send&quot; or &quot;Man of the Javelin&quot; or &quot;Death of Sword&quot;; &quot;Mathousalas&quot;) was a biblical patriarch and a figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. He is claimed to have lived the longest life, dying at 969 years of age. According to the Book of Genesis, Methuselah was the son of Enoch, the father of Lamech, and the grandfather of Noah. Elsewhere in the Bible, Methuselah is mentioned in genealogies in 1 Chronicles and the Gospel of Luke.

His life is described in further detail in other texts such as the Book of Enoch, Slavonic Enoch, and the Book of Moses. Bible commentators have offered various explanations as to why the Book of Genesis describes him as having died at such an advanced age; some believe that Methuselah&#x27;s age is the result of a mistranslation, while others believe that his age is used to give the impression that part of Genesis takes place in a very distant past. Methuselah&#x27;s name has become synonymous with longevity, and he has been portrayed and referenced in film, television and music.

==In the Bible==
Methuselah is a biblical patriarch mentioned in Genesis 5:21–27, as part of the genealogy linking Adam to Noah. The following is taken from the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible:

According to the Hebrew Bible, Methuselah begets Lamech and then lives 782 more years. When Lamech is 182, he begets Noah, and the Genesis Flood comes when Noah is 600 years old. This would imply that Methuselah dies the year of the Flood. (In the Septuagint, most of the ages in this section are different. Lamech begets Noah at age 188, and Methuselah lives 802 years after begetting Lamech.) He was also the oldest of all the figures mentioned in the Bible. Methuselah is mentioned once in the Hebrew Bible outside of Genesis, in . Methuselah is mentioned a single time in the New Testament, when the Gospel of Luke traces Jesus&#x27; lineage back to Adam in Luke 3.

==In other religious texts==
The apocryphal Book of Enoch claims to be revelations of Enoch, transcribed by him and entrusted to be preserved for future generations by his son, Methuselah. In this book, Enoch recounts two visions he has had to Methuselah. The first is about the Flood, and the second chronicles the history of the world from Adam to the Last Judgment. In the latter vision, men are represented as animals – the righteous are white cattle and sheep, the sinners and enemies of Israel are black cattle and wild animals. Following his father&#x27;s death in the Book of Enoch, Methuselah is designated by God as a priest, while Methuselah&#x27;s grandson, Noah&#x27;s brother Nir, is designated by God as his successor. In Slavonic Enoch, Methuselah asks his father for a blessing, and is given instructions on how to live righteously. After their father ascends into heaven, Methuselah and his brothers build an altar and make &quot;a great festivity, praising God who had given such a sign by means of Enoch, who had found favor with Him.&quot;

The Book of Jubilees presents itself as &quot;the history of the division of the days of the Law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the jubilees of the world&quot; and claims to be a revelation of God to Moses, given through the Angel of the Presence in addition to the written Law received by Moses on Mount Sinai; and, while the written Law was to be imparted to all, this was to be a secret tradition entrusted only to the saints of each generation, to Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, and Shem, then to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Levi, and finally to the priests and scribes of the latter times.

Rabbinic literature states that when Noah was 480 years old, all the righteous men were dead—except Methuselah and himself. At God&#x27;s command, they both announced that 120 years would be given to men for repentance; if, in that time, they had not mended their evil ways, the earth would be destroyed. But their plea was in vain; even while Noah was engaged in building the ark, the wicked—who were of immense stature as they were descended from the sons of God—made sport of him and his work, saying: &quot;If the Flood should come, it could not harm us. We are too tall; and, moreover, we could close up with our feet [which were of monstrous size] the springs from below.&quot; They resorted to these tactics; but God heated the water, and their feet and the flesh of their bodies was scalded.

The 17th-century midrashic Sefer haYashar (&quot;Book of Jasher&quot;) describes Methuselah with his grandson Noah attempting to persuade the people of the earth to return to godliness. All other very long-lived people died, and Methuselah was the only one of this class left. God planned to bring the flood after all the men who walked in the ways of the Lord had died (besides Noah and his family). Methuselah lived until the ark was built but died before the flood, since God had promised he would not be killed with the unrighteous. The Sefer haYashar gives Methuselah&#x27;s age at death as 960.

Methuselah (Arabic: &quot;Matūshalaḥ&quot;) is also mentioned in Islam in the various collections of stories of the pre-Islamic prophets, which also say he was an ancestor of Noah. Furthermore, early Islamic writers like Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham always included his name in the genealogy of Muhammad.

The Book of Moses, a 19th-century Mormon text, says that after Enoch and the City of Zion were taken up to heaven, Methuselah stayed behind; this was so that God&#x27;s promises to Enoch – that he would always have descendants on earth and that he would be an ancestor of Noah – would be fulfilled. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints further teaches that Methuselah was a prophet.

==Interpretations==

===Literal===
Some biblical literalists attempt to justify &quot;969 years&quot;: perhaps early humans had a better diet, or a hypothetical &quot;water vapor canopy&quot; protected the earth from radiation before the Flood. Others introduce theological causes: humans were originally to have everlasting life, but sin was introduced into the world by Adam and Eve, its influence became greater with each generation, and God progressively shortened human life, particularly after the Flood. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; says &quot;Certain exegetes solve the difficulty to their own satisfaction by declaring that the year meant by the sacred writer is not the equivalent of our year.&quot;

===Mistranslation===
Some believe that Methuselah&#x27;s extreme age is the result of an ancient mistranslation that converted &quot;months&quot; to &quot;years&quot;, producing a more credible 969 lunar months, or 78½ years, but the same calculation applied to Enoch would have him fathering Methuselah at the age of 5 using numbers from the Masoretic Text. Donald V. Etz suggested that the Genesis 5 numbers &quot;might for convenience have all been multiples of 5 or 10&quot;.

Ellen Bennet argued that the Septuagint Genesis 5 numbers are in tenths of years, which &quot;will explain how it was that they read 930 years for the age of Adam instead of 93 years, and 969 years for Methuselah instead of 96 years, and 950 years for that of Noah instead of 95 years&quot;... &quot;Surely it is much more rational to conclude that Noah lived 50 years instead of 500 years before he took a wife and begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth...&quot; and then lists the Septuagint total ages with decimal points: 93.0 for Adam, 91.0 for Cainan, 96.9 for Methuselah, 95.0 for Noah, etc. This, however, also implies that Enoch became a father at the age of 6.5 and that the other antediluvian patriarchs did so at implausibly young ages.

===Myth===
Yigal Levin states that these long lifespans are intended simply to speed the reader from Adam to Noah. Claus Westermann states they are intended to create the impression of a distant past.

Some versions of the Sumerian King List mention a character named Ubara-Tutu who seems almost identical to Methuselah. He was the son of En-men-dur-ana, a Sumerian mythological figure often compared to Enoch, as he entered heaven without dying. Ubara-Tutu was the king of Sumer until a flood swept over his land. Although the ages of Methuselah and Ubara-Tutu are different, they both died in a Great Flood. Babylonian writer Berossus also claims that, prior to the events of Babylon&#x27;s flood myth, kings could live for tens of thousands of years, which bears some similarity to Genesis 5. In &quot;Forever Young: A Cultural History of Longevity&quot;, Lucian Boia says that the Bible&#x27;s portrayal of Methuselah and other long-lived figures features &quot;traces of the Mesopatamian legends&quot; found in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, where Gilgamesh rules Uruk for 126 years, and his ancestors are said to have ruled for several hundred years each. Boia also notes that tales of kings who lived for thousands of years can be found in both Hindu and Chinese mythology, and that the Bible is comparatively &quot;restrained&quot; in depicting early humans as being able to live for hundreds of years, rather than thousands.

Boia notes that following the Flood, the Bible depicts its characters&#x27; lifespans as gradually diminishing; Noah&#x27;s sons lived between 400 and 500 years, while Abraham died at 175, Moses died at 120, and David died at 70, an age that the Bible portrays as old for David&#x27;s time. Boia compares early biblical figures and their vast lifespans to the people of the Golden Age in Hesiod&#x27;s poem &quot;Works and Days&quot;, whose bodies are perpetually youthful.

===Symbolic===
Methuselah&#x27;s father Enoch, who does not die but is taken by God, is the seventh patriarch, and Methuselah, the eighth, dies in the year of the Flood, which ends the ten-generational sequence from Adam to Noah, in whose time the world is destroyed. Boia believes that Methuselah serves the symbolic function of linking the Creation and the Flood, as Adam would have died during Methuselah&#x27;s lifetime and Methuselah could have learned about the Garden of Eden from Adam. The kings of the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; lived for over a thousand years, and Mesopotamians believed both that living over a thousand years made someone divine or somewhat divine, and that their contemporary kings were descended from the kings of the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;. Robert Gnuse hypothesizes that the author of Genesis made all of its characters die before they turned one thousand as a polemic against these Mesopotamian beliefs, as well as any claim that a king is divine. Gnuse also believes that the author of Genesis said that Methuselah died before he lived a thousand years to show that he was not divine.

==Cultural influence==
Methuselah&#x27;s name &quot;has become a synonym for longevity&quot;. Saying that someone is &quot;as old as Methuselah&quot; is a humorous way of saying that someone is very elderly. In this context, dogs which have lived long lives have been described as &quot;Methuselah dogs&quot;.

The word &quot;Methuselarity&quot;, a blend of Methuselah and singularity, was coined in 2010 by the biomedical gerontologist Aubrey de Grey to mean a future point in time where people are expected not to die from age-related causes anymore, however long they live.

A -year-old Great Basin bristlecone pine (&quot;Pinus longaeva&quot;) tree growing high in the White Mountains of Inyo County in eastern California is called Methuselah.

In the 1970s, mathematician John Conway introduced the Game of Life, a cellular automaton. In cellular automata, methuselahs refer to a small initial state of cells that continue to grow for a large number of generations.

The character Flint from the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Requiem for Methuselah&quot; is a nearly immortal man who was born in ancient Mesopotamia during the year 3,834 BC; and was a soldier (probably of Babylon) before his powers. His identities include Methuselah, Alexander the Great, Solomon, Lazarus of Bethany, Merlin, Leonardo da Vinci and Johannes Brahms. He knew Moses, Socrates, Jesus, Galileo Galilei, and many more. Flint becomes lonely after living for a time on a deserted planet, and creates an immortal gynoid to keep him company. He eventually begins to slowly die because he left Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and dedicates the remainder of his days to the betterment of mankind.

In the TV series &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;, based on Richard K. Morgan&#x27;s 2002 novel of the same name, a class of people who can afford to live forever by transferring their consciousness into cloned bodies are called &quot;Meths&quot; or &quot;Methuselahs.&quot;

In the children&#x27;s literature series &quot;Redwall&quot;, Brian Jacques has multiple anthropomorphic characters named after several biblical figures, one of which is an old abbey mouse named Methuselah, who is described to be the oldest mouse to have ever lived in Redwall Abbey.

The subgiant star HD 140283, believed to be the oldest extant star discovered, is often nicknamed &quot;The Methuselah Star&quot; after the ancient biblical figure. The name is also used to refer to the exoplanet PSR B1620−26 b, which is one of the oldest known exoplanets with an estimated age of 12.7 billion years old.

A giant monster or &quot;Titan&quot; named Methuselah appears in the 2019 film &quot;&quot;, residing in Monarch Outpost 67 in Munich, Germany. In the film, it is woken up by King Ghidorah alongside the other Titans. It also makes an appearance in the 2021 graphic novel &quot;Godzilla Dominion&quot;.

The Steinhart Aquarium in the California Academy of Sciences has an Australian lungfish named Methuselah. It is the world&#x27;s oldest aquarium fish with an estimated age of 93 years old (± 9 years).

Methuselah appeared in Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;Noah,&quot; with Thor Kjartansson playing him as a youth and Anthony Hopkins playing the elderly character. In the film, Noah&#x27;s adopted daughter Ila (played by Emma Watson) is infertile until Methuselah blesses her. Aronofsky&#x27;s version of Methuselah is an eccentric but virtuous hermit who lives on a mountaintop and is friends with Watchers. In this retelling of the Genesis flood, Methuselah dies during the deluge.

The lyrics of Ira Gershwin&#x27;s song &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot; (1935) cast doubt on the idea that Methuselah lived so long.

<text>Puffins are any of three species of small alcids (auks) in the bird genus Fratercula. These are pelagic seabirds that feed primarily by diving in the water. They breed in large colonies on coastal cliffs or offshore islands, nesting in crevices among rocks or in burrows in the soil. Two species, the tufted puffin and horned puffin, are found in the North Pacific Ocean, while the Atlantic puffin is found in the North Atlantic Ocean.

All puffin species have predominantly black or black and white plumage, a stocky build, and large beaks that get brightly colored during the breeding season. They shed the colorful outer parts of their bills after the breeding season, leaving a smaller and duller beak. Their short wings are adapted for swimming with a flying technique underwater. In the air, they beat their wings rapidly (up to 400 times per minute) in swift flight, often flying low over the ocean&#x27;s surface.

== Etymology ==
The English name &quot;puffin&quot; – puffed in the sense of swollen – was originally applied to the fatty, salted meat of young birds of the unrelated Manx shearwater (&quot;Puffinus puffinus&quot;), formerly known as the &quot;Manks puffin&quot;. Puffin is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English &quot;pophyn&quot; or &quot;poffin&quot;) for the cured carcasses of nestling Manx shearwaters.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Fratercula&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the Atlantic puffin (&quot;Fratercula arctica&quot;) as the type species. The name &quot;Fratercula&quot; is Latin for &quot;friar&quot; from the word &quot;fraterculus&quot; &quot;little brother&quot;, because the puffin&#x27;s black and white plumage resemble robes worn by monks.

The genus contain three species. The rhinoceros auklet (&quot;Cerorhinca monocerata&quot;) has sometimes been included in the genus &quot;Fratercula&quot;, and some authors place the tufted puffin in the genus &quot;Lunda&quot;. The puffins and the rhinoceros auklet are closely related, together composing the subfamily Fraterculini.
The oldest alcid fossil is &quot;Hydrotherikornis&quot; from Oregon dating to the Late Eocene while fossils of &quot;Aethia&quot; and &quot;Uria&quot; go back to the Late Miocene. Molecular clocks have been used to suggest an origin in the Pacific in the Paleocene. Fossils from North Carolina were originally thought to have been of two &quot;Fratercula&quot; species, but were later reassigned to one &quot;Fratercula&quot;, the tufted puffin, and a &quot;Cerorhinca species&quot;. Another extinct species, Dow&#x27;s puffin (&quot;Fratercula dowi&quot;) was found on the Channel Islands of California until the Late Pleistocene or early Holocene.
The Fraterculini are thought to have originated in the Pacific, primarily due to their greater diversity there; there exists only one extant species in the Atlantic, compared to two in the Pacific. This species has shown some significant signs of animal intelligence. In January 2020, some researchers reported that, Atlantic puffins were seen using sticks as a tool to scratch themselves. The Fraterculini fossil record in the Pacific extends at least as far back as the middle Miocene, with three fossil species of &quot;Cerorhinca&quot;, and material tentatively referred to that genus, in the middle Miocene to late Pliocene of southern California and northern Mexico. Although there are no records from the Miocene in the Atlantic, a re-examination of the North Carolina material indicated that the diversity of puffins in the early Pliocene was as great in the Atlantic as it is in the Pacific today. This diversity was achieved through influxes of puffins from the Pacific; the later loss of species was due to major oceanographic changes in the late Pliocene due to closure of the Panamanian Seaway and the onset of severe glacial cycles in the North Atlantic.

== Description ==
The puffins are stocky, short-winged, and short-tailed birds, with black upper parts and white or brownish-grey underparts. The head has a black cap, the face is mainly white, and the feet are orange-red. The bill appears large and colorful during the breeding season. The colorful outer part of the bill is shed after the breeding season, revealing a smaller and duller true bill beneath. Because of their striking appearance they are also referred to as &quot;clowns of the sea&quot; and &quot;sea parrots&quot;.

Although the puffins are vocal at their breeding colonies, they are silent at sea. They fly relatively high above the water, typically as compared with the of other auks.

== Behaviour ==
=== Breeding ===
Puffins breed in colonies on coasts and islands; several current or former island breeding sites are referred to as Puffin Island. The male Atlantic puffin builds the nest and exhibits strong nest-site fidelity. Both sexes of the horned puffin help to construct their nest. Horned puffin burrows are usually about deep, ending in a chamber, while the tunnel leading to a tufted puffin burrow may be up to long. The nesting substrate of the tufted and Atlantic puffins is soft soil, into which tunnels are dug; in contrast, the nesting sites of horned puffins are rock crevices on cliffs. The Atlantic puffin burrow is usually lined with material such as grass, leaves, and feathers but is occasionally unlined. The eggs of the Atlantic puffin are typically creamy white but the occasional egg is tinged lilac.

Where rabbits breed, sometimes Atlantic puffins breed in rabbit burrows.

Puffins form long-term pair bonds or relationships. The female lays a single egg, and both parents incubate the egg and feed the chick (or &quot;puffling&quot;). The incubating parent holds the egg against its brood patch with its wings. The chicks fledge at night. After fledging, the chicks spend the first few years of their lives at sea, returning to breed about five years later. Puffins in captivity have been known to breed as early as three years of age.

After breeding, all three puffin species winter at sea, usually far from coasts and often extending south of the breeding range.

Iceland is the home to most of the Atlantic puffins with about 10 million individuals. The largest single puffin colony in the world is in the Westmann Isles of Iceland. In 2009, scientists estimated the number of nests to be 1.1 million, and number of individuals there is estimated to be up to 4 million.

=== Feeding ===

Like many auks, puffins eat both fish and zooplankton but feed their chicks primarily with small marine fish several times a day. The puffins are distinct in their ability to hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer foraging trips since they can come back with more food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behavior is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.

In 2019, animal experts observed puffins, in two separate geographic locations, using sticks to scratch themselves indicating that the seabirds have a basic ability to use tools.

== Relationships with humans ==
=== Hunting ===
Puffins are hunted for eggs, feathers, and meat. Atlantic puffin populations drastically declined due to habitat destruction and exploitation during the 19th century and early 20th century. They continue to be hunted in Iceland and the Faroe Islands.

The Blasket Islands off the Irish coast of County Kerry saw a serious decline due to harvesting. Until the islands were abandoned in 1953, the islanders often lived just above starvation level. As a result, the puffins were hunted in large numbers for food.

The Atlantic puffin forms part of the national diet in Iceland, where the species does not have legal protection. Puffins are hunted by a technique called &quot;sky fishing&quot;, which involves catching the puffins in a large net as they dive into the sea. Their meat is commonly featured on hotel menus. The fresh heart of a puffin is eaten raw as a traditional Icelandic delicacy. On the small Icelandic island of Grimsey as many as 200 puffins can be caught in a single morning.

The name of the English island Lundy is believed to come from the old Norse word for &quot;puffin island&quot; (Lundey), although an alternative explanation has been suggested with Lund referring to a copse, or wooded area.

The Atlantic puffin is the provincial bird of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

<text>Robert Charles Venturi Jr. (June 25, 1925 – September 18, 2018) was an American architect, founding principal of the firm Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates.

Together with his wife and partner, Denise Scott Brown, he helped shape the way that architects, planners and students experience and think about architecture and the built environment. Their buildings, planning, theoretical writings, and teaching have also contributed to the expansion of discourse about architecture.

Venturi was awarded the Pritzker Prize in Architecture in 1991; the prize was awarded to him alone, despite a request to include his equal partner, Scott Brown. Subsequently, a group of women architects attempted to get her name added retroactively to the prize, but the Pritzker Prize jury declined to do so. Venturi coined the maxim &quot;Less is a bore&quot;, a postmodern antidote to Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s famous modernist dictum &quot;Less is more&quot;. Venturi lived in Philadelphia with Denise Scott Brown. He is the father of James Venturi, founder and principal of ReThink Studio.

==Early life and education==
Venturi was born in Philadelphia to Robert Venturi Sr. and Vanna (née Luizi) Venturi, and was raised as a Quaker. Venturi attended school at the Episcopal Academy in Merion, Pennsylvania. He graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Princeton University in 1947 where he was a member-elect of Phi Beta Kappa and won the D&#x27;Amato Prize in Architecture. He received his M.F.A. from Princeton in 1950. The educational program at Princeton under Professor Jean Labatut, who offered provocative design studios within a Beaux-Arts pedagogical framework, was a key factor in Venturi&#x27;s development of an approach to architectural theory and design that drew from architectural history and commercial architecture in analytical, as opposed to stylistic, terms. In 1951 he briefly worked under Eero Saarinen in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and later for Louis Kahn in Philadelphia. He was awarded the Rome Prize Fellowship at the American Academy in Rome in 1954, where he studied and toured Europe for two years.

From 1959 to 1967, Venturi held teaching positions at the University of Pennsylvania, where he served as Kahn&#x27;s teaching assistant, an instructor, and later, as associate professor. It was there, in 1960, that he met fellow faculty member, architect and planner Denise Scott Brown. Venturi taught later at the Yale School of Architecture and was a visiting lecturer with Scott Brown in 2003 at Harvard University&#x27;s Graduate School of Design.
==Career==

A controversial critic of what he saw as the blithely functionalist and symbolically vacuous architecture of corporate modernism during the 1950s, Venturi was one of the first architects to question some of the premises of the Modern Movement. He published his &quot;gentle manifesto&quot;, &quot;Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture&quot; in 1966; in its introduction, Vincent Scully called it &quot;probably the most important writing on the making of architecture since Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;Vers Une Architecture&quot; of 1923.&quot; The work was derived from course lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, and Venturi received a grant from the Graham Foundation in 1965 to aid in its completion. The book demonstrated, through countless examples, an approach to understanding architectural composition and complexity, and the resulting richness and interest. Citing vernacular as well as high-style sources, Venturi drew new lessons from the buildings of architects familiar (Michelangelo, Alvar Aalto) and, at the time, forgotten (Frank Furness, Edwin Lutyens). He made a case for &quot;the difficult whole&quot; rather than the diagrammatic forms popular at the time, and included examples — both built and unrealized — of his own work to demonstrate the possible application of such techniques. The book has been published in 18 languages to date.

Immediately hailed as a theorist and designer with radical ideas, Venturi went to teach a series of studios at the Yale School of Architecture in the mid-1960s. The most famous of these was a studio in 1968 in which Venturi and Scott Brown, together with Steven Izenour, led a team of students to document and analyze the Las Vegas Strip, perhaps the least likely subject for a serious research project imaginable. In 1972, Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour published the folio, &quot;A Significance for A&amp;P Parking Lots, or Learning from Las Vegas.&quot; It was revised using the student work as a foil for new theory, and reissued in 1977 as &quot;Learning from Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form&quot;. This second manifesto was an even more stinging rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes. The book coined the terms &quot;Duck&quot; and &quot;Decorated Shed&quot;, descriptions of the two predominant ways of embodying iconography in buildings. The work of Venturi, Scott Brown, and John Rauch
adopted the latter strategy, producing formally simple &quot;decorated sheds&quot; with rich, complex, and often shocking ornamental flourishes. Venturi and his wife co-wrote several more books at the end of the century, but these two have so far proved to be the most influential.

==Architecture==
The architecture of Robert Venturi, although perhaps not as familiar today as his books, helped redirect American architecture away from a widely practiced modernism in the 1960s to a more exploratory design approach that openly drew lessons from architectural history and responded to the everyday context of the American city. Venturi&#x27;s buildings typically juxtapose architectural systems, elements and aims, to acknowledge the conflicts often inherent in a project or site. This &quot;inclusive&quot; approach contrasted with the typical modernist effort to resolve and unify all factors in a complete and rigidly structured—and possibly less functional and more simplistic—work of art. The diverse range of buildings of Venturi&#x27;s early career offered surprising alternatives to then current architectural practice, with &quot;impure&quot; forms (such as the North Penn Visiting Nurses Headquarters), apparently casual asymmetries (as at the Vanna Venturi House), and pop-style supergraphics and geometries (for instance, the Lieb House).

Venturi created the firm Venturi and Short with William Short in 1960. In his architectural design Venturi was influenced by early masters such as Michelangelo and Palladio, and modern masters including Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Louis Kahn and Eero Saarinen. After John Rauch replaced Short as partner in 1964, the firm&#x27;s name changed to Venturi and Rauch. Venturi married Denise Scott Brown on July 23, 1967, in Santa Monica, California, and in 1969, Scott Brown joined the firm as partner in charge of planning. In 1980, The firm&#x27;s name became Venturi, Rauch, and Scott Brown, and after Rauch&#x27;s resignation in 1989, Venturi, Scott Brown, and Associates. The firm, based in Manayunk, Philadelphia, was awarded the Architecture Firm Award by the American Institute of Architects in 1985. The practice&#x27;s recent work includes many commissions from academic institutions, including campus planning and university buildings, and civic buildings in London, Toulouse, and Japan.

Venturi&#x27;s architecture has had worldwide influence, beginning in the late 1960s with the dissemination of the broken-gable roof of the Vanna Venturi House and the segmentally arched window and interrupted string courses of Guild House. The playful variations on vernacular house types seen in the Trubeck and Wislocki Houses offered a new way to embrace, but transform, familiar forms. The facade patterning of the Oberlin Art Museum and the laboratory buildings demonstrated a treatment of the vertical surfaces of buildings that is both decorative and abstract, drawing from vernacular and historic architecture while still being modern. Venturi&#x27;s work arguably provided a key influence at important times in the careers of architects Robert A. M. Stern, Rem Koolhaas, Philip Johnson, Michael Graves, Graham Gund and James Stirling, among others.

Venturi was a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome, the American Institute of Architects, The American Academy of Arts and Letters and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

==Death==
Venturi died on September 18, 2018, in Philadelphia from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He was 93.

In the wake of Venturi&#x27;s death, Michael Kimmelman, the current architecture critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, tweeted...&quot;RIP the great, inspiring Robert Venturi who opened millions of eyes and whole new ways of thinking about the richness of our architectural environment, and whose diverse work with Denise Scott Brown contains a mix of wit and humanity that continues to transcend labels and time&quot;.

<text>Auks or alcids are birds of the family Alcidae in the order Charadriiformes. The alcid family includes the murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and murrelets. The family contains 25 extant or recently extinct species that are divided into 11 genera. Auks are found throughout the Northern Hemisphere.

Apart from the extinct great auk, all auks can fly, and are excellent swimmers and divers (appearing to &quot;fly&quot; in water), but their walking appears clumsy.

== Names ==
Several species have different English names in Europe and North America. The two species known as &quot;murres&quot; in North America are called &quot;guillemots&quot; in Europe, and the species called little auk in Europe is referred to as dovekie in North America.

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;auk&quot; is derived from Icelandic &quot;álka&quot; and Norwegian &quot;alka&quot; or &quot;alke&quot; from Old Norse &quot;ālka&quot; from Proto-Germanic *&quot;alkǭ&quot; (sea-bird, auk).

=== Taxonomy ===
The family name Alcidae comes from the genus &quot;Alca&quot; given by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the razorbill (&quot;Alca torda&quot;) from the Norwegian word &quot;alke&quot;.

== Description ==
Auks are superficially similar to penguins, having black-and-white colours, upright posture, and some of their habits. Nevertheless, they are not closely related to penguins, but rather are believed to be an example of moderate convergent evolution. Auks are monomorphic (males and females are similar in appearance).

Extant auks range in size from the least auklet, at 85 g (3 oz) and , to the thick-billed murre, at and . Due to their short wings, auks have to flap their wings very quickly to fly.

Although not to the extent of penguins, auks have largely sacrificed flight, and also mobility on land, in exchange for swimming ability; their wings are a compromise between the best possible design for diving and the bare minimum needed for flying. This varies by subfamily, with the &quot;Uria&quot; guillemots (including the razorbill) and murrelets being the most efficient under the water, whereas the puffins and auklets are better adapted for flying and walking.

==Feeding and ecology==
The feeding behaviour of auks is often compared to that of penguins; both groups are wing-propelled, pursuit divers. In the region where auks live, their only seabird competition are cormorants (which are dive-powered by their strong feet). In areas where the two groups feed on the same prey, the auks tend to feed further offshore. Strong-swimming murres hunt faster, schooling fish, whereas auklets take slower-moving krill. Time depth recorders on auks have shown that they can dive as deep as in the case of &quot;Uria&quot; guillemots, for the &quot;Cepphus&quot; guillemots and for the auklets.

==Breeding and colonies==
Auks are pelagic birds, spending the majority of their adult lives on the open sea and going ashore only for breeding, although some species, such as the common guillemot, spend a great part of the year defending their nesting spot from others.

Auks are monogamous, and tend to form lifelong pairs. They typically lay a single egg, and they use the nesting site year after year.

Some species, such as the &quot;Uria&quot; guillemots (murres), nest in large colonies on cliff edges; others, such as the &quot;Cepphus&quot; guillemots, breed in small groups on rocky coasts; and the puffins, auklets, and some murrelets nest in burrows. All species except the &quot;Brachyramphus&quot; murrelets are colonial.

==Evolution and distribution==
Traditionally, the auks were believed to be one of the earliest distinct charadriiform lineages due to their characteristic morphology, but genetic analyses have demonstrated that these peculiarities are the product of strong natural selection, instead; as opposed to, for example, plovers (a much older charadriiform lineage), auks radically changed from a wading shorebird to a diving seabird lifestyle. Thus today, the auks are no longer separated in their own suborder (Alcae), but are considered part of the Lari suborder, which otherwise contains gulls and similar birds. Judging from genetic data, their closest living relatives appear to be the skuas, with these two lineages separating about 30 million years ago (Mya). Alternatively, auks may have split off far earlier from the rest of the Lari and undergone strong morphological, but slow genetic evolution, which would require a very high evolutionary pressure, coupled with a long lifespan and slow reproduction.

The earliest unequivocal fossils of auks are from the late Eocene, some 35 Mya. The genus &quot;Miocepphus&quot;, (from the Miocene, 15 Mya) is the earliest known from good specimens. Two very fragmentary fossils are often assigned to the Alcidae, although this may not be correct: &quot;Hydrotherikornis&quot; (Late Eocene) and &quot;Petralca&quot; (Late Oligocene). Most extant genera are known to exist since the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene (about 5 Mya). Miocene fossils have been found in both California and Maryland, but the greater diversity of fossils and tribes in the Pacific leads most scientists to conclude they first evolved there, and in the Miocene Pacific, the first fossils of extant genera are found. Early movement between the Pacific and the Atlantic probably happened to the south (since no northern opening to the Atlantic existed), with later movements across the Arctic Ocean. The flightless subfamily Mancallinae, which was apparently restricted to the Pacific Coast of southern North America and became extinct in the Early Pleistocene, is sometimes included in the family Alcidae under some definitions. One species, &quot;Miomancalla howardae&quot;, is the largest charadriiform of all time.
The family contains 25 extant or recently extinct species that are divided into 11 genera. The extant auks (subfamily Alcinae) are broken up into two main groups - the usually high-billed puffins (tribe Fraterculini) and auklets (tribe Aethiini), as opposed to the more slender-billed murres and true auks (tribe Alcini), and the murrelets and guillemots (tribes Brachyramphini and Cepphini). The tribal arrangement was originally based on analyses of morphology and ecology. mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequences, and allozyme studies confirm these findings except that the &quot;Synthliboramphus&quot; murrelets should be split into a distinct tribe, as they appear more closely related to the Alcini; in any case, assumption of a closer relationship between the former and the true guillemots was only weakly supported by earlier studies.

Of the genera, only a few species are placed in each. This is probably a product of the rather small geographic range of the family (the most limited of any seabird family), and the periods of glacial advance and retreat that have kept the populations on the move in a narrow band of subarctic ocean.

Today, as in the past, the auks are restricted to cooler northern waters. Their ability to spread further south is restricted as their prey hunting method, pursuit diving, becomes less efficient in warmer waters. The speed at which small fish (which along with krill are the auk&#x27;s principal prey) can swim doubles as the temperature increases from , with no corresponding increase in speed for the bird. The southernmost auks, in California and Mexico, can survive there because of cold upwellings. The current paucity of auks in the Atlantic (six species), compared to the Pacific (19–20 species) is considered to be because of extinctions to the Atlantic auks; the fossil record shows many more species were in the Atlantic during the Pliocene. Auks also tend to be restricted to continental-shelf waters and breed on few oceanic islands.

&quot;Hydotherikornis oregonus&quot; (Described by Miller in 1931), the oldest purported alcid from the Eocene of California, is actually a petrel (as reviewed by Chandler in 1990) and is reassigned to the tubenoses (Procellariiformes). A 2003 paper, &quot;The Earliest North American Record of Auk (Aves: Alcidae) From the Late Eocene of Central Georgia&quot;, reports a Late Eocene, wing-propelled, diving auk from the Priabonain stage of the Late Eocene. These sediments have been dated through Chandronian NALMA {North American Land Mammal Age}, at an estimate of 34.5 to 35.5 million years on the Eocene time scale for fossil-bearing sediments of the Clinchfield Formation, Gordon, Wilkinson County, Georgia. Furthermore, the sediments containing this unabraded portion of a left humerus (43.7 mm long) are tropical or subtropical as evidenced by a wealth of warm-water shark teeth, palaeophied snake vertebrae, and turtles.

<text>Paolo Soleri (21 June 1919 – 9 April 2013) was an American architect and urban planner. He established the educational Cosanti Foundation and Arcosanti. Soleri was a lecturer in the College of Architecture at Arizona State University and a National Design Award recipient in 2006. He coined the concept of &#x27;arcology&#x27; – a synthesis of architecture and ecology as the philosophy of democratic society. He died at home of natural causes on 9 April 2013 at the age of 93.

Soleri authored several books, including &quot;The Bridge Between Matter &amp; Spirit is Matter Becoming Spirit&quot; and &quot;Arcology – City In the Image of Man&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Soleri was born in Turin, Italy. He was awarded his &quot;laurea&quot; (master&#x27;s degree) in architecture from the Politecnico di Torino in 1946. He visited the United States in December 1946 and spent a year and a half in fellowship with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West in Arizona, and at Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin. During this time, he gained international recognition for a bridge design that was displayed at the Museum of Modern Art.

In 1950, Soleri, with his wife Colly (née Corolyn Woods), returned to Italy where he was commissioned to build a large ceramics factory, Ceramica Artistica Solimene, in Vietri on the Amalfi coast.

Soleri adapted ceramics industry processes learned at this time to use in his award-winning designs and production of ceramic and bronze windbells and silt-cast architectural structures. For more than 40 years, proceeds from sales of the wind-bells have been an important source of funds for construction that is meant to test his theoretical work. Ceramic and bronze bells continue to be produced and sold at Arcosanti and Cosanti in Arizona.

In 1956, Soleri settled in Scottsdale, Arizona, with Colly and the elder of their two daughters; the younger was born in Arizona. He began building Arcosanti in 1970 with the help of architecture and design students, as a place to test his urban design hypotheses. This &quot;urban laboratory&quot; (so-dubbed by Ada Louise Huxtable, who at the time was the architecture critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;) became internationally renowned.

Paolo and Colly Soleri made a lifelong commitment to research and experimentation in urban planning. They established the Cosanti Foundation, a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) educational non-profit foundation. Soleri&#x27;s philosophy and works were strongly influenced by the Jesuit paleontologist and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.

==Career==
The International Architecture Symposium &quot;Mensch und Raum&quot; (Man and Space) at the Vienna University of Technology in 1984 received international attention. Paolo Soleri participated with, among others: Justus Dahinden, Dennis Sharp, Bruno Zevi, Jorge Glusberg, Otto Kapfinger, Frei Otto, Pierre Vago, Ernst Gisel, and Ionel Schein.

Soleri was a lecturer in the College of Architecture at Arizona State University and a member of the Lindisfarne Association.

In 1966, Paolo Soleri began working on the design for the Paolo Soleri Amphitheater in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was built for the IAIA (Institute of American Indian Arts) on what is now the campus of the Santa Fe Indian School using large silt cast forms. The property is owned by the nineteen Native American Pueblos of New Mexico and is therefore not protected by local or state preservation laws.

A landmark exhibition, &quot;City in the Image of Man – The Architectural Visions of Paolo Soleri&quot;, organized in 1970 by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, traveled extensively thereafter in the U.S. and Canada, breaking records for attendance. &quot;Two Suns Arcology, A Concept for Future Cities&quot; opened in 1976 at the Xerox Square Center in Rochester, New York. In 1989, &quot;Paolo Soleri Habitats: Ecologic Minutiae&quot;, an exhibition of arcologies, space habitats, and bridges, was presented at the New York Academy of Sciences. More recently, &quot;Soleri&#x27;s Cities, Architecture for the Planet Earth and Beyond&quot; was featured at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts in Scottsdale, AZ. A Soleri bell appears in the film What the *Bleep* Do We Know? His work has been exhibited worldwide.

In 1976, Paolo Soleri was a key participant at UN Habitat I, the first UN forum on human settlements, held it Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, North America. Soleri appeared there together with Buckminster Fuller.

In 1986, four years after the death of his wife from cancer, Soleri was commissioned to design the Arizona Cancer Center Chapel at the University of Arizona. The highly personal architectural expression featured a sand-cast barrel vault ceiling with botanical motifs, sculptural elements and a bell system. 

On 10 December 2010, the Soleri Bridge and Plaza was completed. The structure had been commissioned by Scottsdale Public Art. The pedestrian bridge based on Paolo Soleri&#x27;s design is located on the South Bank of the Arizona Canal and connects a developed retail area of the Scottsdale Waterfront with Old Town Scottsdale. The bridge is incorporated into a plaza including silt cast artwork, as well as a large bell assembly called The Goldwater Bell, also designed by Paolo Soleri.

The feature-length documentary film &quot;The Vision Of Paolo Soleri: Prophet In The Desert&quot; (2013) contains interviews with Morley Safer, Paul Goldberger, Catherine Hardwicke, Will Bruder, Jean-Michel Cousteau, Steven Holl, and Eric Lloyd Wright.

==Arcosanti==

The Cosanti Foundation&#x27;s major project is Arcosanti. Arcosanti, as originally designed by Soleri, was intended for 5,000 people; it has been in construction since 1970. Located near Cordes Junction, about north of Phoenix and visible from Interstate I-17 in central Arizona, the intention of the project is to provide a model that can demonstrate Soleri&#x27;s concept of &quot;Arcology&quot;, architecture coherent with ecology. Arcology was envisioned by Soleri as a hyper-dense city, designed to: maximize human interaction with ready access to shared, cost-effective infrastructural services; conserve water and reduce sewage; minimize the use of energy, raw materials and land; reduce waste and environmental pollution; increase interaction with the surrounding natural environment. In 2010, construction was underway to complete Arcosanti&#x27;s Greenhouse Apron, but that initiative was put on hold not long after Soleri&#x27;s death in 2013.

Arcosanti is intended as a prototype of a desert arcology. Soleri&#x27;s other arcology designs envisioned sites such as the ocean (Nova Noah), &quot;et al.&quot; (see: &quot;Arcology: City in the Image of Man&quot;). Since 1970, over 7000 people have participated in Arcosanti&#x27;s construction. Their international affiliation group is called the Arcosanti Alumni Network.

== Sexual abuse allegation ==
In October 2010, Daniela Soleri – Paolo Soleri&#x27;s daughter – resigned from the Cosanti Foundation board, citing abuse by her father. She stated that some of Soleri&#x27;s inner circle had been told decades earlier, but nothing had been done about it at the time. After the resignation, Soleri stepped down as chairman, but the board made no public statement on the reasons.

After the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art had a major retrospective exhibition on Paolo Soleri in October 2017, Daniela published an article on the website &quot;Medium&quot; on 13 November 2017 accusing her father of persistent sexual abuse, writing:

Encouraged to publish the article by the #MeToo movement, Daniela wrote that she had already come forward to many of her father&#x27;s colleagues but received little response:

In the article, Daniela wrote about her lingering admiration for some of Soleri&#x27;s work and ideas. However, she also warned against uncritical praise of artists with abusive tendencies and the tendency to &quot;accept abusive behavior as a necessary and justified cost for the contributions of intellect or creativity&quot;. Of her father, Daniela wrote:

As noted in &quot;Dezeen&quot;, Daniela&#x27;s article suggested that she had approached &quot;The New York Times&quot; or other news publishers to discuss her father&#x27;s abuse, but had been turned away. The Cosanti Foundation Board released an official statement in response to Daniela Soleri&#x27;s:

&quot;Curbed&quot; editor-in-chief Kelsey Keith wrote &quot;[Daniela] Soleri&#x27;s account is breathtaking not only for its thorough and very personal reckoning with the truth, but for its clear-eyed articulation of the reasons why assigning all intellectual power to a solitary genius is so harmful.&quot; Keith noted that architecture as a profession &quot;hasn&#x27;t (yet) experienced its Weinstein moment&quot;, referring to the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations and the resulting &quot;Weinstein effect&quot; of reporting sexual misconduct committed by powerful men in media and other industries. In a 2018 &quot;Curbed&quot; article, Hilary George-Parkin said:

==Death==
Soleri died on 9 April 2013 and was buried at Arcosanti in its private cemetery, beside his wife.

==Legacy== 

Paolo Soleri&#x27;s architectural and philosophical contributions have left a lasting impact on the fields of architecture, urban planning, and environmental design. His legacy can be observed through various aspects:

===Arcosanti and urban laboratory concepts=== 
Soleri&#x27;s experimental urban laboratory, Arcosanti, serves as a testament to his commitment to the concept of arcology — the fusion of architecture and ecology. The ongoing development of Arcosanti since its inception in 1970 underscores Soleri&#x27;s vision of creating compact, sustainable communities.

===Ecological consciousness===
Soleri&#x27;s work reflects a deep ecological consciousness, emphasizing the need for harmonious coexistence between human settlements and the natural environment. His theoretical framework proposed efficient land use, resource conservation, and a reconsideration of societal norms in favor of ecological balance.

===Influence on contemporary architects and urban planners=== 
Many contemporary architects and urban planners acknowledge Soleri&#x27;s influence on their work. His innovative ideas have inspired a generation of designers to explore sustainable and efficient urban solutions, contributing to the ongoing discourse on environmentally conscious architecture.

===Philosophical contributions=== 
Soleri&#x27;s writings, including his seminal work &quot;Arcology===: The City in the Image of Man,&quot; continue to be referenced in discussions about the future of urban living and the relationship between architecture and society. His philosophical contributions to the understanding of human settlement patterns have sparked interdisciplinary dialogues and debates.

===Recognition and awards===
Soleri&#x27;s impact is further evident in the numerous awards and honors he received during his lifetime, including the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal (2010) for his enduring commitment to blending architecture with ecology.

The Paolo Soleri Archives, the collection of Soleri&#x27;s drawings and writings, is located at Arcosanti. The Soleri Archives is managed by Sue Kirsch. This collection is shared through exhibits, publication and is made available to scholars and historians. 

While Paolo Soleri&#x27;s arcological vision has faced both praise and criticism, his legacy persists as a source of inspiration for those seeking innovative and sustainable solutions to the challenges of urbanization and environmental stewardship.

A number of films and recorded interviews have focused on Soleri&#x27;s life and architectural contributions including: &quot;Paolo Soleri: Ideas and Work&quot; (1972), &quot;Soleri&#x27;s Cities: Architecture for Planet Earth&quot; and &quot;Beyond Reviews&quot; (1993), &quot;Paolo Soleri: Beyond Form&quot; (2013), &quot;The Vision of Paolo Soleri: Prophet in the Desert&quot; (2013), and &quot;Paolo Soleri: Citizen of the Planet&quot; (2016). An interview with Soleri was featured in the environmental documentary &quot;The 11th Hour&quot; (2007).

<text>Moshe Safdie (; born July 14, 1938) is an architect, urban planner, educator, theorist, and author. He is known for incorporating principles of socially responsible design throughout his six-decade career. His projects include cultural, educational, and civic institutions such as neighborhoods and public parks, housing, mixed-use urban centers, and airports. He also had master plans for existing communities and entirely new cities in the Americas, the Middle East, and Asia. Safdie is most identified with designing Marina Bay Sands and Jewel Changi Airport, as well as his debut project Habitat 67, which was originally conceived as his thesis at McGill University. He holds legal citizenship in Israel, Canada, and the United States.

==Early life and education==
Safdie was born in the city of Haifa, Mandatory Palestine, to a family of Syrian Jews. His father was from Aleppo, and his mother, whose family had its origins in Aleppo, was from Manchester. He was nine years old and living in Haifa when the Israeli Declaration of Independence was issued by David Ben-Gurion. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, he lived on a kibbutz where he tended goats and kept bees. In 1953, the Israeli government restricted imports in response to an economic and currency crisis, severely affecting Safdie&#x27;s father&#x27;s textile business. Consequently, when Safdie was 15, his family emigrated from Israel to Canada and settled down in the city of Montreal, where he attended Westmount High School.

In September 1955, Safdie registered for the six-year architectural degree program at the McGill University Faculty of Engineering. In his fifth year, Safdie was named University Scholar. The following summer, he was awarded the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) scholarship. He traveled across North America to observe housing developments in the continent&#x27;s major cities. In his final year, Safdie developed his thesis, entitled &quot;A Case for City Living,&quot; and described as &quot;A Three-Dimensional Modular Building System.&quot; He received his degree in 1961. Two years later, while apprenticing with Estonian-American architect Louis Kahn, Safdie&#x27;s thesis advisor, Dutch-Canadian architect Sandy van Ginkel, invited him to submit his modular project for the World Exposition of 1967. Constructed permanently in Montreal, the site of the World Exposition of 1967, it became known as Habitat 67.

==Career==
In 1964, Safdie established Safdie Architects in Montreal to undertake work on Habitat 67, an adaptation of his thesis at McGill University. Habitat 67 was selected by Canada as a central feature of Expo 67. The project launched the design and implementation of three-dimensional, prefabricated units for living. Safdie designed the complex as a neighborhood with open spaces, garden terraces, and many other amenities typically reserved for the single-family home and adapted to a high-density urban environment.

In 1970, Safdie established a branch office of his practice in Jerusalem. During this period, Safdie combined his interests in social activism and advanced technologies with respect for historical and regional context. He worked on the restoration of the Old City and the construction of Mamilla Mall, linking old and new cities. Other significant works in Israel include the New City of Modi’in, the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, Yitzhak Rabin Center for Israel Studies, Ben Gurion International Airport, National Campus for the Archeology of Israel, multiple projects for Hebrew Union College, and others. During this period, Safdie also worked with leaders in Senegal and Iran. Safdie was consulted on integrated geometry during the development of the Merkava tank by General Israel Tal.

Later, Safdie received commissions for public buildings in Canada: the National Gallery of Canada, the Quebec Museum of Civilization, and Vancouver Library Square. Other notable cultural works include the Khalsa Heritage Memorial Complex, the national museum of the Sikh people in Punjab, India; the United States Institute of Peace Headquarters on the Mall in Washington, DC; the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City, Missouri; and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas.

Safdie has worked on projects in emerging markets, and brought projects to completion in shorter periods, at larger scales. including: Marina Bay Sands, a mixed-use resort integrated with Singapore&#x27;s iconic Skypark; Jewel Changi Airport, a new community-centric airport typology combining marketplace and garden; and Raffles City Chongqing, a mixed-use development featuring over one million square meters of housing, office, retail, transportation, and hotel programs. To connect four towers in Chongqing, China, he designed a sky bridge that has been referred to as the world&#x27;s longest &quot;Horizontal Skyscraper.&quot; Safdie and his team have used sky bridges and multi-level connectivity in other projects to make skyscrapers more accessible.

===Practice===
Today, Safdie Architects is headquartered in Somerville, Massachusetts, near Harvard University, with additional offices in Jerusalem, Toronto, Shanghai, and Singapore. The business is organized as a partnership.

Safdie formed a research program within his office to pursue the advanced investigation of design topics. The practice-oriented fellowship explores speculative ideas outside normal business practice constraints. Fellows work independently with Safdie and firm principals to formulate specific proposals and research plans. The salaried position is in-residence, with full access to project teams and outside consultants. Past fellowships include Habitat of the Future, Mobility on Demand, and Tall Buildings in the city.

In December 2023, Safdie Architects announced it was suspending its involvement in controversial hotel development in Jerusalem&#x27;s Armenian quarter, citing &quot;controversy surrounding the land lease agreement&quot;. This followed an attack by some 30 armed masked individuals on Armenian community members holding a vigil at the site. The Armenian Patriarchate in Jerusalem accused Danny Rothman, Safdie Architects&#x27; client for the project, of organizing the attack.

===Academia===
In 1978, after teaching at McGill, Ben Gurion, and Yale universities, Safdie was appointed Director of the Urban Design Program at Harvard University&#x27;s Graduate School of Design (GSD) and moved to Boston, Massachusetts. He served as Director until 1984. From 1984 to 1989, he was the Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at Harvard. Safdie continues to work closely with the GSD, frequently teaching design studio; Notably, Rethinking the Humanist High-Rise (2019) and Rethinking Hudson Yards (2017).

==Personal life==
In 1959, Safdie married Nina Nusynowicz, a Polish-Israeli Holocaust survivor. Safdie and Nusynowicz have two children, a daughter and a son. Both were born during the inception and erection of Habitat 67. Just before its opening, Safdie and his young family moved into the development. Safdie and Nusynowicz divorced in 1981. His daughter Taal is an architect in San Diego, a partner of the firm Safdie Rabines Architects; His son Oren is a playwright who has written several plays about architecture. Safdie&#x27;s great-nephews are independent filmmakers, Josh and Benny.

In 1981, Safdie married Michal Ronnen, a Jerusalem-born photographer and daughter of artist Vera Ronnen. Safdie and Ronnen have two daughters, Carmelle and Yasmin. Carmelle is an artist, and Yasmin is a social worker.

<text>Louis Isadore Kahn (born Itze-Leib Schmuilowsky; – March 17, 1974) was an Estonian-born American architect based in Philadelphia. After working in various capacities for several firms in Philadelphia, he founded his own atelier in 1935. While continuing his private practice, he served as a design critic and professor of architecture at Yale School of Architecture from 1947 to 1957. From 1957 until his death, he was a professor of architecture at the School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania.

Kahn created a style that was monumental and monolithic; his heavy buildings for the most part do not hide their weight, their materials, or the way they are assembled. He was awarded the AIA Gold Medal and the RIBA Gold Medal. At the time of his death, he was considered by some as &quot;America&#x27;s foremost living architect.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life===

Louis Kahn, whose original name was Itze-Leib (Leiser-Itze) Schmuilowsky (Schmalowski), was born into a poor Jewish family in the Russian Empire (present-day Estonia). His exact birthplace is disputed, but it is widely regarded to be Kuressaare, Saaremaa, although some sources mention Pärnu.

He spent his early childhood in Kuressaare on the island of Saaremaa, then part of the Russian Empire&#x27;s Livonian Governorate. At the age of three, he saw coals in the stove and was captivated by the light of the coal. He put the coal in his apron, which caught on fire and burned his face. He carried these scars for the rest of his life.

In 1906, his family emigrated to the United States, as they feared that his father would be recalled into the military during the Russo-Japanese War. His birth year may have been inaccurately recorded in the process of immigration. According to his son&#x27;s 2003 documentary film, the family could not afford pencils. They made their own charcoal sticks from burnt twigs so that Louis could earn a little money from drawings. Later he earned money by playing piano to accompany silent movies in theaters. He became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. on May 15, 1914. His father changed their name to Kahn in 1915.

===Education===
Kahn excelled in art from a young age, repeatedly winning the annual award for the best watercolor by a Philadelphia high school student. He was an unenthusiastic and undistinguished student at Philadelphia Central High School until he took a course in architecture in his senior year, which convinced him to become an architect. He turned down an offer to go to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to study art under a full scholarship, instead working at a variety of jobs to pay his own tuition for a degree in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania School of Fine Arts. There, he studied under Paul Philippe Cret in a version of the Beaux-Arts tradition, one that discouraged excessive ornamentation.

===Career===
After completing his Bachelor of Architecture in 1924, Kahn worked as senior draftsman in the office of the city architect, John Molitor. He worked on the designs for the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition.

In 1928, Kahn made a European tour. He was interested particularly in the medieval walled city of Carcassonne, France, and the castles of Scotland, rather than any of the strongholds of classicism or modernism. After returning to the United States in 1929, Kahn worked in the offices of Paul Philippe Cret, his former studio critic at the University of Pennsylvania, and then with Zantzinger, Borie and Medary in Philadelphia.

In 1932, Kahn and Dominique Berninger founded the Architectural Research Group, whose members were interested in the populist social agenda and new aesthetics of the European avant-gardes. Among the projects Kahn worked on during this collaboration are schemes for public housing that he had presented to the Public Works Administration, which supported some similar projects during the Great Depression. They remained unbuilt.

Among the more important of Kahn&#x27;s early collaborations was one with George Howe. Kahn worked with Howe in the late 1930s on projects for the Philadelphia Housing Authority and again in 1940, along with German-born architect Oscar Stonorov, for the design of housing developments in other parts of Pennsylvania. A formal architectural office partnership between Kahn and Oscar Stonorov began in February 1942 and ended in March 1947, which produced fifty-four documented projects and buildings.

Kahn did not arrive at his distinctive architectural style until he was in his fifties. Initially working in a fairly orthodox version of the International Style, he was strongly influenced by a stay as architect-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome during 1950, which marked a turning point in his career. After visiting the ruins of ancient buildings in Italy, Greece, and Egypt, he adopted a back-to-the-basics approach. He developed his own style, as influenced by earlier modern movements, but not limited by their sometimes-dogmatic ideologies. In the 1950s and 1960s, as a consultant architect for the Philadelphia City Planning Commission, Kahn developed several plans for the center of Philadelphia that were never executed.

In 1961, he received a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts to study traffic movement in Philadelphia and to create a proposal for a viaduct system.

He described this proposal at a lecture given in 1962 at the International Design Conference in Aspen, Colorado:

In the center of town the streets should become buildings. This should be interplayed with a sense of movement which does not tax local streets for non-local traffic. There should be a system of viaducts which encase an area which can reclaim the local streets for their own use, and it should be made so this viaduct has a ground floor of shops and usable area. A model which I did for the Graham Foundation recently, and which I presented to Mr. Entenza, showed the scheme.

Kahn&#x27;s teaching career began at Yale University in 1947. He eventually was named as the &quot;Albert F. Bemis Professor&quot; of Architecture and Planning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956. Kahn then returned to Philadelphia to teach at the University of Pennsylvania from 1957 until his death, becoming the &quot;Paul Philippe Cret Professor of Architecture&quot;. He also was a visiting lecturer at Princeton University School of Architecture from 1961 to 1967.

In 1974, Kahn died of a heart attack soon after a work trip to India.

==Awards and honors==
Kahn was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1953. He was made a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1964, the year he was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal. In 1965, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician, and received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from Yale University. He was made a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968 and awarded the AIA Gold Medal, the highest award given by the AIA, in 1971, and the Royal Gold Medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), in 1972. In 1971, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

==Personal life==
Kahn had three children with three women. With his wife Esther he had a daughter, Sue Ann. With Anne Tyng, who began her working collaboration and personal relationship with Kahn in 1945, he also had a daughter, Alexandra. When Tyng became pregnant in 1953, to mitigate the scandal, she went to Rome for the birth of their daughter. With Harriet Pattison, he had a son, Nathaniel Kahn. Anne Tyng was an architect and teacher, while Harriet Pattison was a pioneering landscape architect. Kahn&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, written by Paul Goldberger, mentions only Esther and his daughter by her as survivors.

==Documentary==
In 2003, Nathaniel Kahn released a documentary about his father, &quot;My Architect: A Son&#x27;s Journey.&quot; The Oscar-nominated film provides views and insights into Kahn&#x27;s architecture while exploring him personally through his family, friends and colleagues.

==Designs==
* Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut (1951–1953), the first significant commission of Louis Kahn. The ceilings, which are three feet (0.9 meters) thick, consist of a grid of triangular openings that draw the eye upward into dimly-lit, three-sided pyramidal spaces. These exposed spaces provide the means for channeling the heating, cooling, and electrical services throughout the galleries.
* Richards Medical Research Laboratories, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1957–1965), a breakthrough in Kahn&#x27;s career that helped set new directions for modern architecture with its clear expression of served and servant spaces and its evocation of the architecture of the past.
* The Salk Institute, La Jolla, California (1959–1965) was to be a campus composed of three main clusters: meeting and conference areas, living quarters, and laboratories. Only the laboratory cluster, consisting of two parallel blocks enclosing a water garden, was built. The two laboratory blocks frame a long view of the Pacific Ocean, accentuated by a thin linear fountain that seems to reach for the horizon. It has been named &quot;arguably the defining work&quot; of Kahn.
* First Unitarian Church, Rochester, New York (1959–1969), named as one of the greatest religious structures of the twentieth century by Paul Goldberger, the Pulitzer Prize-winning architectural critic. Tall, narrow window recesses create an irregular rhythm of shadows on the exterior while four light towers flood the sanctuary walls with indirect, natural light.
* Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)
* Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, in Ahmedabad, India (1961)
* Eleanor Donnelly Erdman Hall, Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania (1960–1965), designed as a modern Scottish castle.
* Phillips Exeter Academy Library, Exeter, New Hampshire (1965–1972), awarded the Twenty-five Year Award by the American Institute of Architects in 1997. Its dramatic atrium features enormous circular openings into the book stacks.
* Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas (1967–1972), features repeated bays of cycloid-shaped barrel vaults with light slits along the apex, which bathe the artwork on display in an ever-changing diffuse light.
* Arts United Center, Fort Wayne, Indiana (1973), The only building realized of a ten-building Arts Campus vision, Kahn&#x27;s only theatre and building in the Midwest
* Hurva Synagogue, Jerusalem, Israel, (1968–1974), unbuilt
* Yale Center for British Art, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut (1969–1974)
* Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, Roosevelt Island, New York (1972–1974), construction completed 2012
* Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban (National Assembly Building) in Dhaka, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was Kahn&#x27;s last project, developed 1962 to 1974. Kahn got the design contract with the help of Muzharul Islam, one of his students at Yale University, who worked with him on the project. The Bangladeshi Parliament building is the centerpiece of the national capital complex designed by Kahn, which includes hostels, dining halls, and a hospital. According to Robert McCarter, author of &quot;Louis I. Kahn&quot;, &quot;it is one of the twentieth century&#x27;s greatest architectural monuments, and is without question Kahn&#x27;s magnum opus.&quot;

==Legacy==

Louis Kahn&#x27;s work infused the International style with a fastidious, highly personal taste. Isamu Noguchi called him &quot;a philosopher among architects.&quot; He was concerned with creating strong formal distinctions between &quot;served&quot; spaces and &quot;servant&quot; spaces. What he meant by &quot;servant&quot; spaces was not spaces for servants, but rather spaces that serve other spaces, such as stairwells, corridors, restrooms, or any other back-of-house function such as storage space or mechanical rooms. His palette of materials tended toward heavily textured brick and bare concrete, the textures often reinforced by juxtaposition to highly refined surfaces such as travertine marble. Kahn argued that brick can be more than the basic building material:

If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, &#x27;What do you want, Brick?&#x27; And Brick says to you, &#x27;I like an Arch.&#x27; And if you say to Brick, &#x27;Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?&#x27; Brick says, &#x27;I like an Arch.&#x27; And it&#x27;s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. ... You can only do it if you honor the brick and glorify the brick instead of shortchanging it.

In addition to the influence Kahn&#x27;s better-known work has on contemporary architects (such as Muzharul Islam, Tadao Ando), some of his work (especially the unbuilt City Tower Project) became very influential among the high-tech architects of the late twentieth century (such as Renzo Piano, who worked in Kahn&#x27;s office, Richard Rogers, and Norman Foster). His prominent apprentices include Muzharul Islam, Moshe Safdie, Robert Venturi, Jack Diamond, and Charles Dagit.

Many years after his death, Kahn continues to provoke controversy. Before his Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park at the southern tip of Roosevelt Island was built, the editors of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined:

There&#x27;s a magic to the project. That the task is daunting makes it worthy of the man it honors, who guided the nation through the Depression, the New Deal and a world war. As for Mr. Kahn, he died in 1974, as he passed alone through New York City&#x27;s Penn Station. In his briefcase were renderings of the memorial, his last completed plan.

The editorial describes Kahn&#x27;s plan as:

... simple and elegant. Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt&#x27;s defense of the Four Freedoms—of speech and religion, and from want and fear—he designed an open &#x27;room and a garden&#x27; at the bottom of the island. Trees on either side form a &#x27;V&#x27; defining a green space, and leading to a two-walled stone room at the water&#x27;s edge that frames the United Nations and the rest of the skyline.

A group spearheaded by William J. vanden Heuvel raised over $50 million in public and private funds between 2005 and 2012 to establish the memorial. Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park officially opened to the public on October 24, 2012.

==In popular culture==
Kahn was the subject of the 2003 Oscar-nominated documentary film &quot;My Architect: A Son&#x27;s Journey&quot;, presented by Nathaniel Kahn, his son. Kahn&#x27;s complicated family life inspired the &quot;Undaunted Mettle&quot; episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;.

In the 1993 film &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, character David Murphy (played by Woody Harrelson), referenced Kahn during a lecture to architecture students, attributing the quote &quot;Even a brick wants to be something&quot; to Kahn.

Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Lewis Spratlan, with collaborators Jenny Kallick and John Downey (Amherst College, class of 2003), composed the chamber opera &quot;Architect&quot; as a character study of Kahn. The premiere recording was due to be released in 2012 by Navona Records.

<text>A lipogram (from , &quot;leipográmmatos&quot;, &quot;leaving out a letter&quot; is a kind of constrained writing or word game consisting of writing paragraphs or longer works in which a particular letter or group of letters is avoided. Extended Ancient Greek texts avoiding the letter sigma are the earliest examples of lipograms.

Writing a lipogram may be a trivial task when avoiding uncommon letters like &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, or &quot;X&quot;, but it is much more challenging to avoid common letters like &quot;E&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, or &quot;A&quot; in the English language, as the author must omit many ordinary words. Grammatically meaningful and smooth-flowing lipograms can be difficult to compose. Identifying lipograms can also be problematic, as there is always the possibility that a given piece of writing in any language may be unintentionally lipogrammatic. For example, Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot; contains no &quot;Z&quot;, but there is no evidence that this was intentional.

A pangrammatic lipogram is a text that uses every letter of the alphabet except one. For example, &quot;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot; omits the letter &quot;S&quot;, which the usual pangram includes by using the word &quot;jumps&quot;.

==History==
Lasus of Hermione, who lived during the second half of the sixth century BCE, is the most ancient author of a lipogram. This makes the lipogram, according to Quintus Curtius Rufus, &quot;the most ancient systematic artifice of Western literature&quot;. Lasus did not like the sigma, and excluded it from one of his poems, entitled &quot;Ode to the Centaurs,&quot; of which nothing remains; as well as a &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot;, of which the first verse remains:

The Greek poets from late antiquity Nestor of Laranda and Tryphiodorus wrote lipogrammatic adaptations of the Homeric poems: Nestor composed an &quot;Iliad&quot;, which was followed by Tryphiodorus&#x27; &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Both Nestor&#x27;s Iliad and Tryphiodorus&#x27; Odyssey were composed of 24 books (like the original Iliad and Odyssey) each book omitting a subsequent letter of the Greek alphabet. Therefore, the first book omitted alpha, the second beta, and so forth.

Twelve centuries after Tryphiodorus wrote his lipogrammatic &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in 1711, the influential London essayist and journalist Joseph Addison commented on this work (although it had been lost), arguing that &quot;it must have been amusing to see the most elegant word of the language rejected like &quot;a diamond with a flaw in it&quot; if it was tainted by the proscribed letter&quot;.

Petrus Riga, a canon of Sainte-Marie de Reims during the 11th century, translated the Bible, and due to its scriptural obscurities called it &quot;Aurora&quot;. Each canto of the translation was followed by a resume in Lipogrammatic verse; the first canto has no &quot;A&quot;, the second has no &quot;B&quot;, and so on. There are two hundred and fifty manuscripts of Petrus Riga&#x27;s Bible still preserved.

There is a tradition of German and Italian lipograms excluding the letter &quot;R&quot; dating from the seventeenth century until modern times. While some authors excluded other letters, it was the exclusion of the &quot;R&quot; which ensured the practice of the lipogram continued into modern times. In German especially, the &quot;R&quot;, while not the most prevalent letter, has a very important grammatical role, as masculine pronouns, etc. in the nominative case include an &quot;R&quot; (e.g. , , , , ). For the Italian authors, it seems to be a profound dislike of the letter &quot;R&quot; which prompted them to write lipograms excluding this letter (and often only this letter).

There is also a long tradition of &quot;vocalic lipograms&quot;, in which a vowel (or vowels) is omitted. This tends to be the most difficult form of the lipogram. This practice was developed mainly in Spain by the Portuguese author Alonso de Alcala y Herrera who published an octavo entitled . From Spain, the method moved into France and England.

One of the most remarkable examples of a lipogram is Ernest Vincent Wright&#x27;s novel &quot;Gadsby&quot; (1939), which has over 50,000 words but not a single letter &quot;E&quot;. Wright&#x27;s self-imposed rule prohibited such common English words as &quot;the&quot; and &quot;he&quot;, plurals ending in &quot;-es&quot;, past tenses ending in &quot;-ed&quot;, and even abbreviations like &quot;Mr.&quot; (since it is short for &quot;Mister&quot;) or &quot;Rob&quot; (for &quot;Robert&quot;). Yet the narration flows fairly smoothly, and the book was praised by critics for its literary merits.

Wright was motivated to write &quot;Gadsby&quot; by an earlier four-stanza lipogrammatic poem of another author.

Even earlier, Spanish playwright Enrique Jardiel Poncela published five short stories between 1926 and 1927, each one omitting a vowel; the best known are &quot;&quot; (&quot;The new Driver&quot;), without the letter &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (&quot;A Vocationless Husband&quot;), without the &quot;E&quot;.

Interest in lipograms was rekindled by Georges Perec&#x27;s novel (1969) (openly inspired by Wright&#x27;s &quot;Gadsby&quot;) and its English translation &quot;A Void&quot; by Gilbert Adair. Both works are missing the letter &quot;E&quot;, which is the most common letter in French as well as in English. A Spanish translation instead omits the letter &quot;A&quot;, the second most common letter in that language. Perec subsequently wrote (1972), a novel that uses no vowels except for &quot;E&quot;. Perec was a member of Oulipo, a group of French authors who adopted a variety of constraints in their work. is, to date, the longest lipogram in existence.

==Analysing lipograms==
Lipograms are sometimes dismissed by academia. &quot;Literary history seems deliberately to ignore writing as practice, as work, as play&quot;.

In his book &quot;Rethinking Writing&quot;, Roy Harris notes that without the ability to analyse language, the lipogram would be unable to exist. He argues that &quot;the lipogram would be inconceivable unless there were writing systems based on fixed inventories of graphic units, and unless it were possible to classify written texts on the base of the presence or absence of one of those units &quot;irrespective of any phonetic value it might have or any function in the script&quot;&quot;. He then continues on to argue that as the Greeks were able to invent this system of writing as they had a concept of literary notation. Harris then argues that the proof of this knowledge is found in the Greek invention of &quot;a literate game which consists, essentially, in superimposing the structure of a notation on the structure of texts&quot;.

==Pangrammatic lipogram==
A &quot;pangrammatic lipogram&quot; or &quot;lipogrammatic pangram&quot; uses every letter of the alphabet except one. An example omitting the letter &quot;E&quot; is:

A longer example is &quot;Fate of Nassan&quot;, an anonymous poem dating from pre-1870, where each stanza is a lipogrammatic pangram using every letter of the alphabet except &quot;E&quot;.

Two other pangrammatic lipograms omitting only the letter &quot;E&quot; are:

The KJV Bible unintentionally contains two lipogrammatic pangrams: Ezra 7:21 lacks only &quot;J&quot;, and 1 Chronicles 12:40 lacks only &quot;Q&quot;.

==Dropping letters==
Another type of lipogram, which omits every instance of a letter from words that would otherwise contain it, as opposed to finding other words that do not contain the letter, was recorded by Willard R. Espy in &quot;181 Missing O&#x27;s&quot;, based on C. C. Bombaugh&#x27;s univocalic &#x27;Incontrovertible Facts&#x27;.

The above is also a conventional lipogram in omitting the letters A, E, I, and U.

American author James Thurber wrote &quot;The W[o]nderful [O]&quot; (1957), a fairy tale in which villains ban the letter &#x27;O&#x27; from the use by the inhabitants of the island of [Oo]r[oo].

The book &quot;Ella Minnow Pea&quot; by Mark Dunn (2001) is described as a &quot;progressively lipogrammatic epistolary fable&quot;: the plot of the story deals with a small country that begins to outlaw the use of various letters as the tiles of each letter fall off of a statue. As each letter is outlawed within the story, it is (for the most part) no longer used in the text of the novel. It is not purely lipogrammatic, however, because the outlawed letters do appear in the text proper from time to time (the characters being penalized with banishment for their use) and when the plot requires a search for pangram sentences, all twenty-six letters are obviously in use. Also, late in the text, the author begins using letters serving as homophones for the omitted letters (i.e., &quot;PH&quot; in place of an &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot; in place of &quot;C&quot;), which may be considered cheating. At the beginning of each chapter, the alphabet appears along with a sentence, &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;. As the letters are removed from the story, the alphabet, and sentence changes.

:Chapter 1: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;.
:Chapter 2: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY* &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the la*y dog&quot;.
:Chapter 3: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP*RSTUVWXY* &quot;The *uick brown fox jumps over the la*y dog&quot;.
:Chapter 4: ABCDEFGHI*KLMNOP*RSTUVWXY* &quot;The *uick brown fox *umps over the la*y dog&quot;.
:Chapter 5: ABCDEFGHI*KLMNOP*RSTUVW*Y* &quot;The *uick brown fo* *umps over the la*y dog&quot;.

==Other examples==
In Rebeccah Giltrow&#x27;s &quot;Twenty-Six Degrees&quot;, each of the twenty-six chapters, narrated by a different character, deliberately excludes one of the twenty-six letters while using the other twenty-five at least once. And each of the twenty-six letters is excluded from one and only one chapter (the first chapter excludes &quot;A&quot;, the second chapter excludes &quot;B&quot;, the third chapter excludes &quot;C&quot;, etc., the last (twenty-sixth) chapter excludes &quot;Z&quot;).

&quot;Cipher and Poverty (The Book of Nothing)&quot;, a book by Mike Schertzer (1998), is presented as the writings of &quot;a prisoner whose world had been impoverished to a single utterance ... who can find me here in this silence&quot;. The poems that follow use only the vowels &quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, and &quot;O&quot;, and consonants &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, and &quot;W&quot;, taken from that utterance.

&quot;Eunoia&quot;, a book written by Canadian author Christian Bök (2001), is lipogrammatic. The title uses every vowel once. Each of the five chapters in this book is a lipogram. The first chapter in this book uses only words containing the vowel &quot;A&quot; and no other vowel. The second chapter uses only words with no vowel but &quot;E&quot;, and so on.

In December 2009, a collective of crime writers, Criminal Brief, published eight days of articles as a Christmas-themed lipogrammatic exercise.

In June 2013, finance author Alan Corey published &quot;The Subversive Job Search&quot;, a non-fiction lipogram that omitted the letter &quot;Z&quot;.

In the ninth episode of the ninth season of &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;Platonish&quot;, Lily and Robin challenge Barney to obtain a girl&#x27;s phone number without using the letter &quot;E&quot;.

A website called the Found Poetry Review asked each of its readers (as part of a larger series of challenges) to compose a poem avoiding all letters in the title of the newspaper that had already been selected. For example, if the reader was using the &quot;New York Times&quot;, then they could not use the letters &quot;E&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;Y&quot;.

Grant Maierhofer&#x27;s &quot;Ebb&quot;, a novel published in 2023, by Kernpunkt Press, was written entirely without the letter &quot;A&quot;.

==Non-English examples==
In Turkey the tradition of &quot;Lebdeğmez atışma&quot; or &quot;Dudak değmez aşık atışması&quot; (literally: two troubadours throwing verses at each other where lips do not touch each other) that is still practiced, a form of instantaneously improvised poetry sung by opposing Ashiks taking turns for artfully criticising each other with one verse at a time, usually by each placing a pin between their upper and lower lips so that the improvised song, accompanied by a Saz (played by the ashik himself), consists only of labial lipograms i.e. without words where lips must touch each other, effectively excluding the letters B, F, M, P and V from the text of the improvised songs.

The seventh- or eighth-century &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; by Daṇḍin includes a prominent lipogrammatic section at the beginning of the seventh chapter. Mantragupta is called upon to relate his adventures. However, during the previous night of vigorous lovemaking, his lips have been nibbled several times by his beloved; as a result, they are now swollen, making it painful for him to close them. Thus, throughout his narrative, he is compelled to refrain from using any labial consonants (प,फ,ब,भ,म).

In France, J. R. Ronden premièred &quot;la Pièce sans A&quot; (&quot;The Play without A&quot;) in 1816. Jacques Arago wrote in 1853 a version of his &quot;Voyage autour du monde&quot; (&quot;Voyage around the world&quot;), but without the letter &quot;a&quot;. Georges Perec published in 1969 &quot;La Disparition&quot;, a novel without the letter &quot;e&quot;, the most commonly used letter of the alphabet in French. Its published translation into English, &quot;A Void&quot;, by Gilbert Adair, won the Scott Moncrieff Prize in 1995.

In Sweden, a form of lipogram was developed out of necessity at the Linköping University. Because files were shared and moved between computer platforms where the internal representation of the characters &quot;Å&quot;, &quot;Ä&quot;, &quot;Ö&quot;, &quot;å&quot;, &quot;ä&quot;, and &quot;ö&quot; (all moderately common vowels) were different, the tradition to write comments in source code without using those characters emerged. 

&quot;Zanzō ni Kuchibeni o&quot; (1989) by Yasutaka Tsutsui is a lipogrammatic novel in Japanese. The first chapter is written without the syllable あ, and usable syllables decrease as the story advances. In the last chapter, the last syllable, ん, vanishes and the story is closed.

&quot;Zero Degree&quot; (1991) by Charu Nivedita is a lipogrammatic novel in Tamil. The entire novel is written without the common word (&quot;oru&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, also used as the indefinite article), and there are no punctuation marks in the novel except dots. Later the novel was translated into English.

Russian 18th-century poet Gavriil Derzhavin avoided the harsh &quot;R&quot; sound (and the letter that represents it) in his poem &quot;The Nightingale&quot; to render the bird&#x27;s singing.

The seventh-century Arab theologian Wasil ibn Ata gave a sermon without the letter &quot;rāʾ&quot; (R). However, it was the 19th-century Mufti of Damascus, Mahmud Hamza &quot;al-Hamzawi&quot; (d. 1887), who produced perhaps the most remarkable work of this genre with a complete commentary of the Quran (published in two volumes) without dotted letters in either the introduction or interlinear commentary. This is all the more remarkable because dotted letters make up about half of the Arabic alphabet.

In Hungarian language, the game &quot;eszperente&quot; is a game where people only speak using words that contain the vowel &quot;e&quot;; as this makes otherwise straightforward communication complicated, a lot of creative thinking is required in describing common terms in roundabout ways.

==Non-literary lipograms==
While a lipogram is usually limited to literary works, there are also &quot;chromatic lipograms&quot;, works of music that avoid the use of certain notes. Examples avoiding either the second, sixth, and tenth notes, or the third, seventh, and eleventh notes in a chromatic scale have been cited.

==Reverse lipogram==
A reverse lipogram, also known as an antilipo or transgram is a type of constrained writing where each word must contain a particular letter in the text.

<text>Ernst Werner Siemens ([[von]] Siemens from 1888; ; ; 13 December 1816 – 6 December 1892) was a German electrical engineer, inventor and industrialist. Siemens&#x27;s name has been adopted as the SI unit of electrical conductance, the siemens. He founded the electrical and telecommunications conglomerate Siemens and invented the electric tram, trolley bus, electric locomotive and electric elevator.

His dynamo laid the foundation for the modern age of electricity and he was involved in the development of the electric car.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Ernst Werner Siemens was born in Lenthe, today part of Gehrden, near Hannover, in the Kingdom of Hanover in the German Confederation, the fourth child (of fourteen) of Christian Ferdinand Siemens (31 July 1787 – 16 January 1840) and wife Eleonore Deichmann (1792 – 8 July 1839). His father was a tenant farmer of the Siemens family, an old family of Goslar, documented since 1384. Carl Heinrich von Siemens and Carl Wilhelm Siemens were his brothers.

===Middle years===
After finishing school, Siemens intended to study at the Bauakademie Berlin. However, since his family was highly indebted and thus could not afford to pay the tuition fees, he chose to join the Prussian Military Academy&#x27;s School of Artillery and Engineering, between the years 1835–1838, instead, where he received his officers training. Siemens was thought of as a good soldier, receiving various medals, and contributing to the invention of electrically-charged sea mines, which were used to combat a Danish blockade of Kiel during the First Schleswig War.

Upon returning home from war, he chose to work on perfecting technologies that had already been established and eventually became known worldwide for his advances in various technologies. In 1843 he sold the rights to his first invention to Elkington of Birmingham. Siemens invented a telegraph that used a needle to point to the right letter, instead of using Morse code. Based on this invention, he founded the company &quot;Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens &amp; Halske&quot; on 1 October 1847, with the company opening a workshop on 12 October.

The company was internationalised soon after its founding. One brother of Werner represented him in England (Sir William Siemens) and another in St. Petersburg, Russia (Carl von Siemens), each earning recognition. Following his industrial career, he was ennobled in 1888, becoming Werner von Siemens. He retired from his company in 1890 and died in 1892 in Berlin.

The company, reorganized as Siemens &amp; Halske AG, Siemens-Schuckertwerke and – since 1966 – Siemens AG was later led by his brother Carl, his sons Arnold, Wilhelm, and Carl Friedrich, his grandsons Hermann and Ernst and his great-grandson Peter von Siemens. Siemens AG is one of the largest electrotechnological firms in the world. The von Siemens family still owns 6% of the company shares (as of 2013) and holds a seat on the supervisory board, being the largest shareholder.

===Later years===
Apart from the pointer telegraph, Siemens made sufficient contributions to the development of electrical engineering that he became known as the founding father of the discipline in Germany. He built the world&#x27;s first electric passenger train in 1879, and the first electric elevator in 1880. His company produced the tubes with which Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen investigated x-rays. He claimed invention of the dynamo although others invented theirs around the same time. On 14 December 1877 he received German patent No. 2355 for an electromechanical &quot;dynamic&quot; or moving-coil transducer, which was adapted by A. L. Thuras and E. C. Wente for the Bell System in the late 1920s for use as a loudspeaker. Wente&#x27;s adaptation was issued in 1929.

In May 1881, Siemens &amp; Halske inaugurated the world&#x27;s first electric tram service, in the Berlin suburb of Groß-Lichterfelde. Siemens is also the father of the trolleybus, which he initially tried and tested on 29 April 1882, using his &quot;Elektromote&quot;.

===Personal life===
He was married twice: first in 1852 to Mathilde Drumann (died 1 July 1867), the daughter of the historian Wilhelm Drumann; second in 1869 to his relative Antonie Siemens (1840–1900). His children from first marriage were Arnold von Siemens and Georg Wilhelm von Siemens, and his children from second marriage were Hertha von Siemens (1870 – 5 January 1939), married in 1899 to Carl Dietrich Harries, and Carl Friedrich von Siemens.

Siemens was an advocate of social democracy, and he hoped that industrial development would not be used in favour of capitalism, stating:

He also rejected the claim that science leads to materialism, stating instead:

===Commemoration===
Werner von Siemens&#x27; portrait appeared on the banknote issued by the Reichsbank from 1929 until 1939. Printing ceased in 1939 but the note remained in circulation until the issue of the Deutsche Mark on 21 June 1948.

In 1923, German botanist Ignatz Urban published &quot;Siemensia&quot;, which is a monotypic genus of flowering plant from Cuba belonging to the family Rubiaceae and was named in honor of Werner von Siemens.

<text>Grylloblattidae, commonly known as the icebugs or ice crawlers, is a family of extremophile (psychrophile) and wingless insects that live in the cold on top of mountains and the edges of glaciers. It is the only member of Grylloblattodea, which is generally considered an order. Alternatively, Grylloblattodea, along with Mantophasmatodea (rock crawlers), have been ranked as suborders of the order Notoptera. Grylloblattids are wingless insects mostly less than 3 cm long, with a head resembling that of a cockroach, with long antennae and having elongated cerci arising from the tip of their abdomen. They cannot tolerate warmth (most species will die at 10 °C) and many species have small distribution ranges.

==Overview==
Grylloblattids, ice crawlers or icebugs puzzled the scientists who discovered them in 1914, E.M. Walker and T.B. Kurata; the first species named was &quot;Grylloblatta campodeiformis&quot;, which means &quot;cricket-cockroach shaped like a &quot;Campodea&quot;&quot; (a kind of two-pronged bristletail). Most are nocturnal and appear to feed on detritus. They have long antennae (23–45 segments) and long cerci (5–8 segments), but no wings. Their eyes are either missing or reduced and they have no ocelli (simple eyes). Their closest living relatives are the recently discovered Mantophasmatodea. Most species are less than 3 cm long, the largest being &quot;Namkungia magnus&quot;.

The family has its own order, Grylloblattodea (sometimes considered a suborder of Notoptera). It contains 5 genera and about 34 extant species.

Most species have restricted distributions and small populations and with increased warming their habitats are threatened, making them endangered. In North America some species like &quot;Grylloblatta barberi&quot; and &quot;G. oregonensis&quot; are known from single sites.

==Habitat and distribution==
Grylloblattodea are nocturnal extremophiles typically found in leaf litter and under stones in extremely cold environments, usually at higher elevations. They are known to inhabit cold temperate forests to glaciers and the edges of ice sheets. Their optimal living temperature is between . They can be killed at colder temperatures due to ice formation in the body, so when the temperature drops below their optimal range they survive by living under snow pack near the soil. They have a very narrow range of temperatures that they prefer and cannot withstand high temperatures; many species are killed when the temperature rises about 5 °C above their optimal temperature. They move in response to the seasons so as to maintain an optimal temperature in their foraging habitat.

Grylloblattidae are patchily distributed in glaciers, caves, montane environments, and occasionally lower-elevation forests in western North America, East Asia (Korea and Japan), and Central Asia (Siberia, China, and Kazakhstan). They are predicted to occur in several other mountain chains in Asia, including parts of the Himalayas.

==Diet==
They are omnivorous, but feed primarily on dead arthropods and carrion. When arthropod carcasses are scarce, they subsist on plant material.

==Evolution==
Grylloblattidae is generally thought to have emerged from within the &quot;Grylloblattida&quot;, a poorly defined group of extinct winged insects that first appeared in the Late Carboniferous, over 300 million years ago. The winged &quot;Aristovia&quot; from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar, around 100 million years ago is thought to be closely related to modern Grylloblattidae due to its very similar mouthparts.

<text>Eamonn Kevin Roche (June 14, 1922 – March 1, 2019) was an Irish-born American Pritzker Prize-winning architect. Kevin Roche was the archetypal modernist and &quot;member of an elite group of third generation modernist architects — James Stirling, Jorn Utzon, and Robert Venturi — and is considered to be &quot;the&quot; most logical and systematic designer of the group. He and his partner John Dinkeloo of the firm KRJDA produced over a half-century of matchless creativity.&quot;

Roche and Dinkeloo were responsible for the design/master planning of over 200 built projects in both the U.S. and abroad. These projects include 8 museums, 38 corporate headquarters, 7 research facilities, performing arts centers, theaters, and campus buildings for six universities. In 1967 he created the master plan for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and thereafter designed all of the new wings and installation of many collections, including the reopened American and Islamic wings.

Born in Dublin and a graduate from University College Dublin, Roche went to the United States to study with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology. In the U.S., he became the principal designer for Eero Saarinen and opened his own architectural firm in 1967.

Among other awards, Roche received the Pritzker in 1982, the Gold Medal Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1990, and the AIA Gold Medal in 1993.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Roche was born in Dublin, Ireland, during one of the most tumultuous periods in Irish history: the Irish Civil War. Eamon Roche, Kevin&#x27;s father, had been jailed twice for &quot;revolutionary activities&quot;. Kevin was born during his father&#x27;s second imprisonment. After Eamon was released from prison, he moved his family far away from war-torn Dublin to the pastoral hamlet of Mitchelstown in southwestern Ireland. Situated at the foothills of the Galtee Mountain Range, Roche&#x27;s upbringing was anything but typical. It was forged by Eamon&#x27;s keen managerial oversight of the Mitchelstown Dairy Co-operative in which Kevin worked alongside his father as dairy farmers. Eamon Roche successfully annexed all the surrounding dairy cooperatives, forging them into the largest in southwest Ireland. Later, the creamery was bought out by KerryGold Creamery.

Roche&#x27;s life-changing moment came when his father asked him to design a warehouse to store the cheese that the dairy farms produced. Seeing his natural abilities unfold, Eamon enrolled the young Roche in a secondary school in Cashel, County Tipperary called Rockwell College. It is a well-known school in Ireland where Éamon de Valera, one of the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s founding fathers, once taught mathematics. While Roche attended Rockwell College, his interest in architecture came about after reading a book by the English architect John Ruskin, &quot;The Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot;. He recalled that the book &quot;was not the easiest to read but was very interesting&quot;. 

===University and early career===
In 1940, Kevin returned to Dublin to continue his interest in architecture at University College of Dublin, or UCD. His first architectural drawing was of a pig enclosure composed of concrete blocks. Though initially trained in German Beaux Arts, this gave way to modernism and post-modernism interests. After graduating from UCD in 1945, Roche made the circuit with practically every well-known modernist of architecture: Michael Scott in Dublin from 1945 to 1946, Maxwell Fry in London from summer to fall of 1946, then Mies van der Rohe and Ludwig Hilberseimer at Illinois Institute of Technology in 1948.

After less than one year at IIT, Roche did not have enough money to continue for a second year. Since he could not receive his master&#x27;s degree without funds, he instead thought of putting his architectural skills to practical use. In 1949, he moved to New York City and &quot;badgered the UN Planning Office for a job&quot;. He was hired at the planning office for the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City. He began working on the United Nations complex at the firm of Harrison &amp; Abramovitz and stayed on for eight months. During Christmas of 1950, he left to visit his family back in Ireland, but when he returned, his job had been eliminated.

Penniless and uncertain of his future in the United States, Roche contemplated returning home to Ireland. But an architect at the UN, sympathetic to his plight, recommended he call the firm of Saarinen, Swanson, and Associates, where the 83-year-old Eliel Saarinen still practiced in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. The firm&#x27;s famous father was complemented by the family&#x27;s talent: second wife Loja, son (Eero), and daughter (Pipsan). The firm had said that Eero Saarinen would be going to New York to interview prospective candidates. After spending an evening at New York&#x27;s famous Stork Club with a cousin from Ireland, Roche was unexpectedly called for an interview the following morning. Roche went to the interview, and as Saarinen was talking to him, Roche had fallen asleep. Roche recalls that Saarinen was still talking when he awoke, and was nonetheless hired. He moved to Michigan and began working for the firm, which had undergone a name change to be known as Eero Saarinen and Associates (ESA). 

===Eero Saarinen &amp; Associates, Michigan===
 After his father Eliel died, Eero Saarinen moved up to assume directorship. In 1950, Roche joined the firm. His future partner, John Dinkeloo (1918-1991), joined the firm in 1951 after he had left the architectural form of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill in Chicago. They became lifelong friends and business partners. There, Roche also met his future wife, Jane Claire Tuohy, with whom he eventually had five children. In 1954, he became the Principal Design Associate to Saarinen and assisted him on all projects from that time until Saarinen&#x27;s death in September 1961.

===Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates===
Later, Roche and Dinkeloo moved the practice to Hamden, Connecticut. Saarinen&#x27;s firm morphed into Roche-Dinkeloo Associates or KRJDA. Today, the firm continues on as Roche Modern, where Roche&#x27;s son, Eamon, is currently managing director. Thus, Roche and Dinkeloo laid the groundwork for the preeminent architectural firm which has been coined the &quot;poster child architectural firm of corporate America&quot;.

In 1966, Roche and Dinkeloo formed Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates and completed Saarinen&#x27;s projects. They completed twelve major unfinished Saarinen builds, including some of Saarinen&#x27;s best-known work: the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, the expressionistic TWA Flight Center at JFK International Airport in New York City, Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., the strictly modern John Deere Headquarters in Moline, Illinois, and the CBS Headquarters building in New York City.

Following this, Roche and Dinkeloo&#x27;s first major commission was the Oakland Museum of California, a complex for the art, natural history, and cultural history of California with a design featuring interrelated terraces and roof gardens. The city was planning a monumental building to house natural history, technology, and art, and Roche provided a unique concept: a building that is a series of low-level concrete structures covering a four block area, on three levels, the terrace of each level forming the roof of the one below, i.e. a museum (in three sections) with a park on its roof. This kind of innovative solution went on to become Roche&#x27;s trademark.

This project was followed by the equally highly acclaimed Ford Foundation Building in New York City, considered the first large-scale architectural building in the U.S. to devote a substantial portion of its space to horticultural pursuits. Its famous atrium was designed with the notion of having urban green-space accessible to all and is an early example of the application of environmental psychology in architecture. The building was recognized in 1968 by &quot;Architectural Record&quot; as &quot;a new kind of urban space&quot;.

The acclaim that greeted the Oakland Museum and Ford Foundation earned Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates a ranking at the top of their profession. Shortly afterward they began a 40-year association with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for which they did extensive remodeling and built many extensions to house new galleries including the one containing the Egyptian Temple of Dendur. Other high-profile commissions for the firm came from clients as varied as Wesleyan University, the United Nations, Cummins Engines, Union Carbide, The United States Post Office, and the Knights of Columbus.

In 1982, Kevin Roche became one of the first recipients of the Pritzker Prize, generally regarded as architecture&#x27;s equivalent to the Nobel prize. Following this accolade, Roche&#x27;s practice went global, receiving commissions for buildings in Paris, Madrid, Singapore, and Tokyo. He completed his first and only Irish project, The Convention Centre Dublin, in 2010.

Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates has designed numerous corporate headquarters, office buildings, banks, museums, art centers, and even part of the Bronx Zoo. Roche served as a trustee of the American Academy in Rome, president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a member of the National Academy of Design, and a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. 
Roche died on March 1, 2019, at his home in Guilford, Connecticut, aged 96.

==Prizes and awards==

The work of Kevin Roche has been the subject of special exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Architectural Association of Ireland in Dublin, and the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. A 2012 exhibition, &quot;Kevin Roche: Architecture as Environment,&quot; opened at the Yale School of Architecture in New Haven, Connecticut, and has been viewed at The Museum of the City of New York, the Building Museum in Washington, and the University of Toronto.

In addition to the Pritzker Prize, Roche was the recipient of numerous honors and awards including the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal Award, the American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal Award for Architecture, and the &quot;French Academie d&#x27;Architecture&quot; Grand Gold Medal.

<text>SOM, an initialism of its original name Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill LLP, is a Chicago-based architectural, urban planning, and engineering firm. It was founded in 1936 by Louis Skidmore and Nathaniel Owings. In 1939, they were joined by engineer John O. Merrill. The firm opened its second office, in New York City, in 1937 and has since expanded, with offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., London, Melbourne, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seattle, and Dubai.

Notable for its role as a pioneer of modernist architecture in America and for its groundbreaking work in skyscraper design and construction, SOM has designed some of the world&#x27;s most significant architectural and urban projects including several of the tallest buildings in the world: John Hancock Center (1969, second tallest in the world when built), Willis Tower (1973, tallest in the world for almost twenty-five years), One World Trade Center (2014, currently the seventh tallest in the world), and Burj Khalifa (2010, currently the world&#x27;s tallest building). The firm&#x27;s notable current work includes the new headquarters for the Walt Disney Company, the global headquarters for Citigroup, Moynihan Train Hall and the expanded Penn Station complex, and the restoration and renovation of the Waldorf Astoria in New York City; airport projects at O&#x27;Hare International Airport, Kansas City International Airport, and Kempegowda International Airport; urban master plans for the Charenton-Bercy district in Paris, New Covent Garden in London, Treasure Island in San Francisco, the East Riverfront in Detroit; P.S. 62, the first net-zero-energy school in New York City; and the design of the Moon Village, a concept for the first permanent lunar settlement, developed with the European Space Agency and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

SOM&#x27;s multidisciplinary practice works across a range of scales and project types, providing services in architecture, building services/MEP engineering, digital design, graphics, interior design, structural engineering, civil engineering, sustainable design and urban design &amp; planning.

==History==
===20th century===
The firm&#x27;s first influential project was Lever House, completed in 1952 to become the first International Style office building in New York City. Constructed of glass and steel at a time when Park Avenue was lined with masonry buildings, Lever House introduced a modernist aesthetic that embodied the spirit of the times and influenced an entire generation of high-rise construction.

In 1962, architectural historian Reyner Banham wrote that, &quot;It gave architectural expression to an age just as the age was being born ... Lever House was an uncontrollable success, imitated and sometimes understood all over the Americanized world, and one of the sights of New York&quot;.

In the 1970s, SOM pioneered a new era of skyscraper design with its work in Chicago, including the John Hancock Center (completed 1970) and Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower), which became the world&#x27;s tallest structure upon its completion in 1973 and remained so for more than 20 years. Both towers are the result of collaboration between architect Bruce Graham and engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan, who is often considered to be the greatest structural engineer of the 20th century. Khan invented a tubular framing system that made it possible to build higher than ever before. This system has been adapted and is still used today for some of the world&#x27;s most recent tallest buildings, including the 828-meter-tall Burj Khalifa, designed by SOM and completed in 2010.

In the 1960s and 1970s, SOM was an early leader in computer-aided design, developing in-house digital tools that preceded the CAD systems used widely today. This work quickly proved valuable in the generation of structural analysis tools that were embraced by Fazlur Khan and his engineering team, aiding the design of projects such as the John Hancock Center.

The activity of an experimental research group at SOM, known as the Computer Group, exemplifies a particularly productive effort within the firm to incorporate technological research into its practice. Through the 1970s and 1980s, members of the relatively small, dedicated group pushed to integrate the computer&#x27;s enhanced data-storing and analytical abilities into various phases of the design process. Through these initiatives, SOM was able to identify the potential of the computer to not only expedite necessary calculations but also introduce new ways of representing and sharing information. Just as structural engineering came to be seen early on at SOM as a means of generating rather than simply realizing architectural ideas, with concerted effort, computers gained credence at the firm, and eventually throughout the industry, as a catalyst for architectural innovation.

In 1980, an in-house team at SOM created Architecture Engineering Systems, a computer program that was used to study complex structural systems and energy demands. This program is regarded as a precursor to the array of building information modeling (BIM) tools now used by the profession.

SOM&#x27;s projects have featured works of art by significant artists. In many cases, the firm&#x27;s architects and engineers played a role in commissioning, engineering, and installing the artworks—such as with the Chicago Picasso, a 50-foot-tall steel sculpture in the city&#x27;s civic center. Joan Miró, Alexander Calder, Isamu Noguchi, Harry Bertoia, Richard Lippold, Jean Dubuffet and Chryssa are among the artists whose work has been a part of SOM projects. More recently, SOM&#x27;s architects and engineers have collaborated with artists such as James Turrell, Janet Echelman, Iñigo Manglano–Ovalle, James Carpenter, and Jaume Plensa.

In 1953, the firm completed the Manufacturers Trust Company Building in New York City, the first international style bank building in the United States, Seven years later, in 1960, the firm completed Pepsi-Cola World Headquarters. In 1961, the firm completed One Chase Manhattan Plaza, which is now 28 Liberty Street, the first International Style building to rise in New York City&#x27;s Financial District. The 28 Liberty Street project helped reverse an exodus of corporate clients from Lower Manhattan to Midtown Manhattan and the suburbs. SOM&#x27;s design for 28 Liberty Street also created a plaza surrounding the tower, a novel concept that would be adapted in many future projects.

In Colorado Springs, Colorado, SOM planned a campus for the United States Air Force Academy. Built between 1958 and 1968, the campus broke from the traditions of West Point and Annapolis to become the first U.S. military academy designed in the modern style. The centerpiece of the campus is the Cadet Chapel, designed by architect Walter Netsch. The American Institute of Architects awarded the building with its prestigious Twenty-five Year Award, conferred onto &quot;a building that has set a precedent for the last 25 to 35 years and continues to set standards of excellence for its architectural design and significance&quot; .

In 1969, SOM founder Nathaniel Owings wrote, &quot;Civilizations leave marks on the Earth by which they are known and judged. In large measure, the nature of their immortality is gauged by how well their builders made peace with the environment.&quot; (source: Nathaniel Owings, &quot;The American Aesthetic,&quot; Harper &amp; Row, 1969) This ethos has shaped the firm&#x27;s journey into sustainable practices. An early example is the corporate headquarters it designed for timberland company Weyerhaeuser, completed in 1971, which has been called the &quot;original green building&quot; not only for its integration into the surrounding landscape, but also for its use of efficient building systems.

===21st century===
In 2007, the firm completed a large-scale sustainable architecture project for the U.S. Census Bureau, the first federal office building to receive LEED certification. Like Weyerhaeuser, the design of the campus works in concert with its natural surroundings and incorporates a range of design strategies to reduce its environmental impact.

In 2015, SOM completed the first net-zero-energy school building in New York City and one of the first worldwide. The Kathleen Grimm School for Leadership and Sustainability at Sandy Ground, Staten Island, has been awarded for its sustainability performance by organizations, including the American Institute of Architects, the Municipal Art Society, and the Urban Land Institute. SOM has been recognized for its research and experimentation with new energy-saving and carbon-reducing technologies, including a timber tower and a modified concrete slab design.

===Women at SOM===
Architect Sally Harkness, a founding partner at The Architects Collaborative in 1947, was interviewed at the firm during World War II along with her husband Chip Harkness, but only her husband received a job offer. In an interview later in life, Sally Harkness explained that she was told the firm did not believe in hiring women. Norma Merrick Sklarek, an African-American, was hired by SOM in 1955 after having been previously rejected by 19 other firms. She stayed there for 5 years, eventually starting her own firm. Patricia Weston Swan spent her 30-year career with SOM including many leadership roles but never achieved partner status, perceived by a colleague in the Denver officer as evidence of the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; that was in place at that time at SOM

When Julia Murphy, AIA joined SOM in 2008 there were no women partners and only a handful of directors. To attempt to address this imbalance, in 2010 she relaunched the Women&#x27;s Initiative at SOM which had previously been active between 2002 and 2004.

The year 2020 marked a change in which three female partners, Carrie Byles, Xuan Fu, and Laura Ettelman were named to the executive committee of the 1250-person firm.

==SOM Foundation==

The SOM Foundation was first established in 1979 with the mission to support and cultivate emerging design leaders by granting awards to outstanding students of architecture, design, urban design, and engineering. Many winners of SOM Foundation awards have gone on to distinguish themselves in professional and academic careers. Past winners include Marion Weiss (1982), Werner Sobek (1983), Himanshu Parikh (1985), Santiago Calatrava (1988), and Joshua Ramus (1995). The SOM Foundation continues to support emerging design leaders and interdisciplinary research with five annual awards granted to students from the United States, the United Kingdom, and China.

==Awards==
Throughout its history, SOM has been recognized with more than 2000 awards for quality and innovation. In November 1990, SOM was placed on the cover of Interior Design Magazine for The Top Ten, Winner Of IBA. In 1996 and 1962, SOM received the Architecture Firm Award from the American Institute of Architects, which recognizes the design work of an entire firm. SOM is the only firm to have received this honor twice. In August 2009 SOM received four of 13 available R+D Awards from Architect Magazine. In addition, a collaboration between SOM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, The Center for Architecture, Science and Ecology, was honored with a fifth award.

== Disciplines ==
=== Urban design and planning ===
Since the firm&#x27;s founding, SOM has led large-scale urban design and planning projects. Many of these projects have had a lasting role in the development of cities and urban areas in America and the world, including London, Chicago, New York City, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Denver, and Portland, Oregon. SOM&#x27;s City Design practice has made influential contributions to urban design approaches such as transit-oriented development, overbuild strategies and sustainable urbanism.
In 1942, SOM was hired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for a highly confidential project: the planning of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. By 1945, the town was home to 75,000 people. The work at Oak Ridge prepared SOM to take on the large-scale architectural and planning projects that would define the postwar era.

For more than 20 years, SOM was involved in the development of a master plan for the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy appointed Nathaniel Owings as chair of the Pennsylvania Avenue redesign council, and the resulting 1966 Washington Mall Master Plan laid the framework for a dynamic, inviting, and pedestrian-friendly place. A second master plan developed in 1973, envisioned the construction of major cultural facilities, including the National Air and Space Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden.
In Baltimore in the 1960s, SOM played a pivotal role in preventing the destruction of the city&#x27;s historic districts and Inner Harbor to make way for the planned construction of an elevated highway. As the chair of a team to develop an alternate plan, Nathaniel Owings convinced the Federal Highway Administration to sign off on a plan to reroute the highway. It was eventually built around the harbor and the historic Federal Hill district, saving these irreplaceable neighborhoods.

In the 1970s, SOM collaborated with landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to plan and design the Portland Transit Mall. The goals were to revitalize the Oregon city&#x27;s downtown area, to encourage the use of mass transit, and create walkable streets. The Transit Mall helped to change the perception of downtown Portland. As one of the first projects of its kind in the United States, it helped to usher in an era of streetscape design that prioritizes people. Another important commission in the 1970s was as the lead design firm for the Boston Transportation Planning Review, a metropolitan-wide re-design of Boston&#x27;s entire transit and roadway infrastructure.

Beginning in the 1980s, SOM planned the design and construction of Canary Wharf in London. Intended to accommodate a flourishing financial sector and revitalize London&#x27;s former Docklands, the plan included more than 20 building sites and a host of public spaces and amenities. The plan also provided for a robust transportation network including a light rail station that connects to the London Underground. The massive scale of the project led to the opening of SOM&#x27;s London office in 1986. The firm&#x27;s work at Canary Wharf continued into the new millennium, with the completion of Five Canada Square in 2002.
In central London, the opportunity to build above rail lines near Liverpool Street Station spurred the construction of Broadgate, a new business district. SOM devised the master plan, and over three decades designed several of the site&#x27;s 14 buildings. In order to build high-rise structures atop one of the city&#x27;s busiest stations and its railyard, SOM&#x27;s structural engineering team devised a deck over the tracks to allow for various building configurations on top. Exchange House, completed in 1990, is a building that acts as a bridge spanning the tracks. In 2008, Broadgate Tower, the district&#x27;s tallest building, was completed. SOM also designed public space enhancements for the area.

SOM designed the master plan for Chicago&#x27;s Millennium Park, which opened in 2004 and has become one of the city&#x27;s most visited attractions. Constructed above bus lanes, parking garages, and a rail yard, Millennium Park can be considered the world&#x27;s largest roof garden. Below the great lawn, two new levels of parking were built, bus stops were added, and rail stations were renovated and expanded, including Millennium Station. The project revitalized a formerly blighted downtown site and marked the completion of Chicago planner Daniel Burnham&#x27;s 100-year vision for the area.

In Denver, SOM was commissioned to expand and transform the city&#x27;s historic Union Station into a major regional hub. 20 acres of former rail yards have been converted into a transit-oriented urban district that orchestrates light rail, pedestrian, bicycle, and bus routes, as well as commuter and intercity rail. Completed in 2014, the project has spurred more than $3.5 billion worth of private investment in the surrounding district.

===Structural engineering===
The earliest SOM engineer was John O. Merrill. Fazlur Khan, another engineer at SOM, is best known for his design and construction of the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), and John Hancock Center and for his designs of structural systems that remain fundamental to all high-rise skyscrapers. Indeed, Khan is responsible for developing the algorithms that made the Hancock building and many subsequent skyscrapers possible. Another notable SOM engineer is Bill Baker, who is best known as the engineer of Burj Khalifa (Dubai, 2010), the world&#x27;s tallest man-made structure. To support the tower&#x27;s record heights and slim footprint, he developed the &quot;buttressed core&quot; structural system, consisting of a hexagonal core reinforced by three buttresses that form a Y shape.

===Interior design===
Davis Allen, a pioneer in corporate interior design, had a forty-year tenure at SOM. The designer of the iconic Andover chair, Allen was an institution in &quot;the profession he helped to establish—the total design of the interior corporate environment with furniture, art, and functional and decorative objects integrated into a comprehensively planned space.&quot;

<doc id="53635" wikidata="Q25375" url="?curid=53635" title="Odonata">
<text>Odonata is an order of predatory flying insects that includes the dragonflies and damselflies (as well as the &quot;Epiophlebia&quot; damsel-dragonflies). The two major groups are distinguished with dragonflies (Anisoptera) usually being bulkier with large compound eyes together and wings spread up or out at rest, while damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) are usually more slender with eyes placed apart and wings folded together along body at rest. Adult odonates can land and perch, but rarely walk.

All odonates have aquatic larvae called naiads or nymphs, and all of them, larvae and adults, are carnivorous and are almost entirely insectivorous, although at the larval stage they will eat anything that they can overpower, including small fish, tadpoles, and even adult newts. The adults are superb aerial hunters and their legs are specialised for catching prey in flight.

Odonata in its narrow sense forms a subgroup of the broader Odonatoptera, which contains other dragonfly-like insects.
The scientific study of the Odonata is called odonatology.

== Etymology and terminology==

Johan Christian Fabricius coined the term &quot;Odonata&quot; in 1793 from the Ancient Greek (Ionic form of ) &quot;tooth&quot;. One hypothesis is that it was because their maxillae are notably toothed.

The word &quot;dragonfly&quot; usually denotes only Anisoptera, but is sometimes used to mean all Odonata. Odonata enthusiasts avoid ambiguity by using the term &quot;true dragonfly&quot;, or simply &quot;anisopteran&quot;, when they mean just the Anisoptera. An alternative term &quot;warriorfly&quot; has been proposed.

== External morphology ==

=== Size ===

The largest living odonate is the giant Central American helicopter damselfly &quot;Megaloprepus coerulatus&quot; (Zygoptera: Pseudostigmatidae) with a wing span of . The heaviest living odonates are &quot;Tetracanthagyna plagiata&quot; (Anisoptera: Aeshnidae) with a wing span of , and &quot;Petalura ingentissima&quot; (Anisoptera: Petaluridae) with a body length of (some sources ) and wing span of . The longest extant odonate is the Neotropical helicopter damselfly &quot;Mecistogaster linearis&quot; (Zygoptera: Pseudostigmatidae) with a body length of .

The smallest living dragonfly is &quot;Nannophya pygmaea&quot; (Anisoptera: Libellulidae) from east Asia, with a body length of and a wing span of . The smallest damselflies (and also the smallest odonates) are species of the genus &quot;Agriocnemis&quot; (Zygoptera: Coenagrionidae) with a wing span of only .

=== Description ===

These insects characteristically have large rounded heads covered mostly by well-developed, compound eyes, which provide good vision, legs that facilitate catching prey (other insects) in flight, two pairs of long, transparent wings that move independently, and elongated abdomens. They have three ocelli and short antennae. The mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include simple chewing mandibles in the adult.

Flight in the Odonata is direct, with flight muscles attaching directly to the wings; rather than indirect, with flight muscles attaching to the thorax, as is found in the Neoptera. This allows active control of the amplitude, frequency, angle of attack, camber and twist of each of the four wings entirely independently.

In most families, there is a structure on the leading edge near the tip of the wing called the pterostigma. This is a thickened, hemolymph–filled and often colorful area bounded by veins. The functions of the pterostigma are not fully known, but it most probably has an aerodynamic effect and may also have a visual function. More mass at the end of the wing may also reduce the energy needed to move the wings up and down. The right combination of wing stiffness and wing mass could reduce the energy consumption of flying. A pterostigma is also found among other insects, such as bees.

The nymphs have stockier, shorter, bodies than the adults. In addition to lacking wings, their eyes are smaller, their antennae longer, and their heads are less mobile than in the adult. Their mouthparts are modified, with the labium being adapted into a unique prehensile organ called a labial mask for grasping prey. Damselfly nymphs breathe through external gills on the abdomen, while dragonfly nymphs respire through an organ in their rectum.

== Evolution ==

=== Fossil history ===

Members of the crown group Odonata first appeared during the Late Triassic, though members of their total group, Odonatoptera, first appeared in the Late Carboniferous, making them one of the earliest groups of winged insects. The fossils of odonates and their cousins, including Paleozoic &quot;giant dragonflies&quot; like &quot;Meganeuropsis permiana&quot; from the Permian of North America, reached wing spans of up to and a body length of , making it the largest insect of all time. This insect belonged to the order Meganisoptera, the griffinflies, related to odonates but not part of the modern order Odonata in the restricted sense. They have one of the most complete fossil records going back 319 million years.

The Odonata is closely related to mayflies and several extinct orders in a group called the Palaeoptera, but this grouping might be paraphyletic. What they do share with mayflies is the nature of how the wings are articulated and held in rest.

Tarsophlebiidae is a prehistoric family of Odonatoptera that can be considered either a basal lineage of Odonata or their immediate sister taxon.

=== Phylogeny ===

The phylogenetic tree of the orders and suborders of odonates according to Bybee et al. 2021:

=== Taxonomy ===
In some treatments, the Odonata are understood in an expanded sense, essentially synonymous with the superorder Odonatoptera, but not including the prehistoric Protodonata. In this approach, instead of Odonatoptera, the term Odonatoidea is used. The systematics of the &quot;Palaeoptera&quot; are by no means resolved; what can be said however is that regardless of whether they are called &quot;Odonatoidea&quot; or &quot;Odonatoptera&quot;, the Odonata and their extinct relatives do form a clade.

The Anisoptera was long treated as a suborder, with a third suborder, the Anisozygoptera (ancient dragonflies). However, the combined suborder Epiprocta (in which Anisoptera is an infraorder) was proposed when it was thought that the &quot;Anisozygoptera&quot; was paraphyletic, composed of mostly extinct offshoots of dragonfly evolution. The four living species placed in that group are (in this treatment) in the infraorder Epiophlebioptera, whereas the fossil taxa that were formerly there are now dispersed about the Odonatoptera (or Odonata &quot;sensu lato&quot;). World Odonata List considers Anisoptera as a suborder along with Zygoptera and Anisozygoptera as well-understood and widely preferred terms.

== Ecology and life cycle ==
Odonates are aquatic or semi-aquatic as juveniles. Thus, adults are most often seen near bodies of water and are frequently described as aquatic insects. However, many species range far from water. They are carnivorous (or more specifically insectivorous) throughout their life, mostly feeding on smaller insects.

Male Odonata have complex genitalia, different from those found in other insects. These include grasping cerci at the tip of the abdomen for holding the female, and a secondary set of copulatory organs located between the second and third abdominal segment in which the spermatozoa are stored after being produced by the primary genitals— whose external opening is known as the genital pore, on the ninth abdominal segment. This process is called intra-male sperm translocation (ST). Because the male copulatory organ has evolved independently from that in other insects, it has been suggested the stem-group dragonflies had external sperm transfer. To mate, the male claspers grasps the female by the thorax (Zygoptera) or head (Anisoptera) while the female bends her abdomen so that her own genitalia can be grasped by the copulatory organ holding the sperm. This is known as the &quot;wheel&quot; position. In Anisoptera, males often mate while flying, lifting the females in the air, which typically last from a couple of seconds to a minute or two, whereas the males in Zygoptera mate while perched. They might even move to different spots during the mating process, which can make it last longer, anywhere between five and ten minutes. Male Odonata are very competitive when it comes to mating that in some species, the males use the cerci located at the tip of the abdomen to remove the sperm of a rival male&#x27;s from the female and put in his own.

Eggs are laid in water or on vegetation near water or wet places, and hatch to produce pronymphs which live off the nutrients that were in the egg. They then develop into instars with approximately 9–14 molts that are (in most species) voracious predators on other aquatic organisms, including small fishes. The nymphs grow and molt, usually in dusk or dawn, into the flying teneral immature adults, whose color is not yet developed. These transform into reproductive adults.

Odonates can act as bioindicators of water quality in rivers because they rely on high quality water for proper development in early life. Since their diet consists entirely of insects, odonate density is directly proportional to the population of prey, and their abundance indicates the abundance of prey in the examined ecosystem. Species richness of vascular plants has also been positively correlated with the species richness of dragonflies in a given habitat. This means that in a location such as a lake, if one finds a wide variety of odonates, then a similarly wide variety of plants should also be present. This correlation is not common to all bioindicators, as some may act as indicators for a different environmental factor, such as the pool frog acting as a bioindicator of water quality due to its high quantity of time spent in and around water.

In addition, odonates are very sensitive to changes to average temperature. Many species have moved to higher elevations and latitudes as global temperature rises and habitats dry out. Changes to the life cycle have been recorded with increased development of the instar stages and smaller adult body size as the average temperature increases. As the territory of many species starts to overlap, the rate hybridization of species that normally do not come in contact is increasing. If global climate change continues many members of Odonata will start to disappear. Because odonates are such an old order and have such a complete fossil record they are an ideal species to study insect evolution and adaptation. For example, they are one of the first insects to develop flight and it is likely that this trait only evolved once in insects, looking at how flight works in odonates, the rest of flight can be mapped out.

=== Cannibalism ===
Cannibalism has been recorded in many species of odonates, at both the larval and adult stages. Cannibalism is caused by either errors in species recognition, intrasexual competition for mating, or prevention of mating harassment.

<text>Constrained writing is a literary technique in which the writer is bound by some condition that forbids certain things or imposes a pattern.

Constraints are very common in poetry, which often requires the writer to use a particular verse form.

==Description==

Constraints on writing are common and can serve a variety of purposes. For example, a text may place restrictions on its vocabulary, e.g. Basic English, copula-free text, defining vocabulary for dictionaries, and other limited vocabularies for teaching English as a second language or to children.

In poetry, formal constraints abound in both mainstream and experimental work. Familiar elements of poetry like rhyme and meter are often applied as constraints. Well-established verse forms like the sonnet, sestina, villanelle, limerick, and haiku are variously constrained by meter, rhyme, repetition, length, and other characteristics.

Outside of established traditions, particularly in the avant-garde, writers have produced a variety of work under more severe constraints; this is often what the term &quot;constrained writing&quot; is specifically applied to. For example:

* Lipogram: a letter (commonly e or o) is outlawed.
* Reverse-lipograms: each word must contain a particular letter, the opposite concept of a standard lipogram.
* Univocalic poetry, using only one vowel.
* Mandated vocabulary, where the writer must include specific words (for example, Quadrivial Quandary solicits individual sentences containing all four words in a daily selection).
* Bilingual homophonous poetry, where the poem makes sense in two different languages at the same time, constituting two simultaneous homophonous poems.
* Alliteratives or tautograms, in which every word must start with the same letter (or subset of letters; see &quot;Alphabetical Africa&quot;).
* Acrostics: first letter of each word/sentence/paragraph forms a word or sentence.
* Abecedarius: first letter of each word/verse/section goes through the alphabet.
* Palindromes, such as the word &quot;radar&quot;, read the same forwards and backwards.
* Anglish, favouring Anglo-Saxon words over Greek and Roman/Latin words.
* Pilish, where the lengths of consecutive words match the digits of the number π.
* Anagrams, words or sentences formed by rearranging the letters of another.
* Limitations in punctuation, such as Peter Carey&#x27;s book &quot;True History of the Kelly Gang&quot;, which features no commas.
* One-syllable article, a form unique to Chinese literature, using many characters all of which are homophones; the result looks sensible as writing but is very confusing when read aloud.
* Chaterism, where the length of words in a phrase or sentence increases or decreases in a uniform, mathematical way.
* Aleatory, where the reader supplies a random input.
* Erasure, which involves erasing words from an existing text and framing the result on the page as a poem.

The Oulipo group is a gathering of writers who use such techniques. The Outrapo group uses theatrical constraints.

There are a number of constrained writing forms that are restricted by length, including:
* Six-Word Memoirs: 6 words
* Haiku: ~ 3 lines (5–7–5 syllables or 2–3–2 beats recommended.)
* Minisaga: 50 words, +15 for title
* Drabble: 100 words
* Twiction: espoused as a specifically constrained form of microfiction where a story or poem is exactly 140 characters long.
* Sijo: three lines average 14–16 syllables, for a total of 44–46: theme (3, 4,4,4); elaboration (3,4,4,4); counter-theme (3,5) and completion (4,3).

== Notable examples ==
* Ernest Vincent Wright&#x27;s &quot;Gadsby&quot; (1939) is an English-language novel consisting of 50,000 words, none of which contain the letter &quot;e&quot;.
* In 1969, French writer Georges Perec published &quot;La Disparition&quot;, a novel that did not include the letter &quot;e&quot;. It was translated into English in 1995 by Gilbert Adair. Perec subsequently joked that he incorporated the &quot;e&quot;s not used into &quot;La Disparition&quot; in the novella &quot;&quot; (1972), which uses no vowels other than &quot;e&quot;. &quot;Les Revenentes&quot; was translated into English by Ian Monk as &quot;The Exeter Text: Jewels, Secrets, Sex&quot;.
* Perec also wrote &quot;Life A User&#x27;s Manual&quot; using the Knight&#x27;s Tour method of construction. The book is set in a fictional Parisian block of flats, where Perec devises the elevation of the building as a 10×10 grid: 10 storeys, including basements and attics and 10 rooms across, including 2 for the stairwell. Each room is assigned to a chapter, and the order of the chapters is given by the knight&#x27;s moves on the grid. 
* Several of the Psalms are abecedarian in the Hebrew alphabet.
* The 2004 French novel &quot;Le Train de Nulle Part&quot; (&quot;The Train from Nowhere&quot;) by Michel Thaler was written entirely without verbs.
* &quot;let me tell you&quot; (2008), a novel by the Welsh writer Paul Griffiths, uses only the words allotted to Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot;.
* Experimental Canadian poet Christian Bök&#x27;s &quot;Eunoia&quot; is a univocalic that uses only one vowel in each of its five chapters.
* One famous piece of constrained writing in the Chinese language is &quot;Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den&quot;, which consists of 92 characters, all with the sound &quot;shi&quot;. Another is the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot; in which all 1000 characters are unique without any repetition.
* &quot;Cadaeic Cadenza&quot; is a short story by Mike Keith using the first 3835 digits of pi to determine the length of words. &quot;Not A Wake&quot; is a book using the same constraint based on the first 10,000 digits.
* &quot;Ella Minnow Pea&quot; is a book by Mark Dunn where certain letters become unusable throughout the novel.
* &quot;Alphabetical Africa&quot; is a book by Walter Abish in which the first chapter only uses words that begin with the letter &quot;a&quot;, while the second chapter incorporates the letter &quot;b&quot;, and then &quot;c&quot;, etc. Once the alphabet is finished, Abish takes letters away, one at a time, until the last chapter, leaving only words that begin with the letter &quot;a&quot;.
* Mary Godolphin wrote versions of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;, &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, and other books using only monosyllabic words.
* Theodor Geisel, also known as Dr. Seuss, wrote the well-known children&#x27;s book &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; using only 50 different words on a 50 dollar bet with Bennett Cerf.
* &quot;The Gates of Paradise&quot; is a book by Jerzy Andrzejewski where the whole text is just two sentences, one of which is very long.
* &quot;Zero Degree&quot; is a postmodern lipogrammatic novel written in 1998 by Tamil author Charu Nivedita, later translated into Malayalam and English. The Tamil words &quot;oru&quot; and &quot;ondru&quot; (the English equivalents are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot; and &quot;one&quot;) have not been mentioned anywhere in the novel, except one chapter. Keeping with the numerological theme of Zero Degree, the only numbers expressed in either words or symbols are numerologically equivalent to nine (with the exception of two chapters). This Oulipian ban includes the very common word one. Many sections of the book are written entirely without punctuation, or using only periods. 
* Uruguayan musician, comedian and writer Leo Maslíah&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;Líneas&quot; (&quot;Lines&quot;) is written entirely with paragraphs comprising a single sentence.
* Examples of erasure include Tom Phillips&#x27;s &quot;A Humument&quot; (1970); Mary Ruefle&#x27;s &quot;A Little White Shadow&quot; (2006), an erasure of the Victorian novel of the same name by Emily Malbone Morgan; Janet Holmes&#x27;s &quot;The ms of my kin&quot; (2009), an erasure of poetry by Emily Dickinson; Matthea Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Of Lamb&quot; (2011), an erasure of a biography of Charles Lamb; &quot;ALL KINDS OF FUR&quot;, Margaret Yocom&#x27;s erasure of a controversial tale from the Brothers Grimm (2018); and many more.
* Anna Rabinowitz&#x27;s &quot;Darkling&quot; (2001) is a book-length acrostic about the Holocaust.
* The 17th-century Odia poet Upendra Bhanja wrote multiple epics (Satisha Bilasa, Kala Kautuka, Baidehisha Bilasha, etc.) with the same syllable at the beginning of each sentence.
* &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Bob&quot; has lyrics consisting entirely of palindromes.

===Comics===
Notable examples of constrained comics:
* Gustave Verbeek&#x27;s &quot;The Upside Downs of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo&quot;, a weekly 6-panel comic strip in which the first half of the story was illustrated and captioned right-side-up, then the reader would turn the page up-side-down, and the inverted illustrations with additional captions describing the scenes told the second half of the story, for a total of 12 panels.
* &quot;The Angriest Dog in the World&quot; a comic strip by David Lynch. Each four-panel comic has identical artwork. The only change between each comic is the dialogue in the first three panels.
* &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot; which uses the same artwork, with only dialogue changing.
* &quot;Watchmen&quot; is created with a number of formal constraints; issue #5 in particular, entitled &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot;, follows a palindromic structure.
* &quot;Partially Clips&quot; which uses three identical panels based on clipart.
* The many works of the Oubapo group.
* Matt Madden&#x27;s &quot;99 Ways to Tell a Story&quot;.

<text>Peccaries (also javelinas or skunk pigs) are pig-like ungulates of the family Tayassuidae (New World pigs). They are found throughout Central and South America, Trinidad in the Caribbean, and in the southwestern area of North America. Peccaries usually measure between in length, and a full-grown adult usually weighs about . They represent the closest relatives of the family Suidae, which contains pigs and relatives. Together Tayassuidae and Suidae are grouped in the suborder Suina within the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates).

Peccaries are social creatures that live in herds. They are omnivores and eat roots, grubs, and a variety of other foods. They can identify each other by their strong odors. A group of peccaries that travel and live together is called a squadron. A squadron of peccaries averages between six and nine members.

Peccaries first appeared in North America during the Miocene and migrated into South America during the Pliocene–Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange.

They are often confused with feral domestic pigs, commonly known as &quot;razorback&quot; hogs in many parts of the United States, when the two occur in the wild in similar ranges.

The Maya kept herds of peccaries, using them in rituals and for food. They are kept as pets in many countries in addition to being raised on farms as a source of food.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;peccary&quot; is derived from the Carib word or .

In Portuguese, a peccary is called , , , , among other names like or . In Spanish, it is called , (a word also used to describe wild boar), , or . The word &quot;javelina&quot; derives from the Spanish word for &quot;wild boar&quot;. In French Guiana and Suriname, the animal is called &quot;pakira&quot;.

The scientific name Tayassuidae derives from the same source as the Portuguese .

==Characteristics==

A peccary is a medium-sized animal, with a strong resemblance to a pig. Like a pig, it has a snout ending in a cartilaginous disc and eyes that are small relative to its head. Also like a pig, it uses only the middle two digits for walking, although, unlike pigs, the other toes may be altogether absent. Its stomach is not ruminating. Though it has three chambers, it is more complex than those of pigs. Peccaries are foregut fermenters (pigs are hindgut fermenters). This foregut fermentation, similar to but separately evolved from a ruminant, is an example of convergent evolution.

Peccaries are omnivores and will eat insects, grubs, and occasionally small animals, although their preferred foods consist of roots, grasses, seeds, fruit, and cacti—particularly prickly pear. Pigs and peccaries can be differentiated by a number of characteristic, including tails and ear shape. The ears of pigs are large and upright and often pointed while the ears of peccaries are small and rounded. Pigs also have tasseled tails, but peccaries&#x27; tails are small and discreet.

The most noticeable difference between pigs and peccaries is the shape of the canine teeth, or tusks. In European pigs, the tusks are long and curve around on themselves, whereas in peccaries, the tusks are short and straight and interlock with each other, prohibiting side-to-side movement of the jaw. The jaws and tusks of peccaries are adapted for crushing hard seeds and slicing into plant roots, and they also use their tusks to defend against predators. The dental formula for peccaries is: 

By rubbing the tusks together, they can make a chattering noise that warns potential predators to stay away.

Peccaries are social animals, often forming herds. Over 100 individuals have been recorded for a single herd of white-lipped peccaries, but collared and Chacoan peccaries usually form smaller groups. Such social behavior seems to have been the situation in extinct peccaries as well. The giant peccary (&quot;Pecari maximus&quot;) of Brazil appears to be less social, primarily living in pairs. Peccaries rely on their social structure to defend territory, protect against predators, regulate temperature, and interact with other members of the species.

Peccaries have scent glands below each eye and another on their backs, though these are believed to be rudimentary in &quot;P. maximus&quot;. They use the scent to mark herd territories, which range from . They also mark other herd members with these scent glands by rubbing one against another. The pungent odor allows peccaries to recognize other members of their herd, despite their myopic vision. The odor is strong enough to be detected by humans, which earns the peccary the nickname of &quot;skunk pig&quot;.

==Species==
===Extant species===

Three (possibly four) living species of peccaries are found from the Southwestern United States through Central America and into South America and Trinidad, each in their own genus.
*&quot;Tayassu&quot;
**White-lipped peccary (&quot;T. pecari&quot;)
*&quot;Catagonus&quot;
**Chacoan peccary (&quot;C. wagneri&quot;)
*&quot;Dicotyles&quot;
**Collared peccary (&quot;D. tajacu&quot;)

The collared peccary (&quot;Dicotyles tajacu&quot;) or &quot;musk hog&quot;, referring to the animal&#x27;s scent glands, occurs from the Southwestern United States into South America and the island of Trinidad. The coat consists of wiry peppered black, gray, and brown hair with a lighter colored &quot;collar&quot; circling the shoulders. They bear young year-round, but most often between November and March, with the average litter size consisting of two to three offspring. They are found in many habitats, from arid scrublands to humid tropical rain forests. The collared peccary is well-adapted to habitat disturbed by humans, merely requiring sufficient cover. They can be found in cities and agricultural land throughout their range.

Notable populations exist in the suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, where they feed on ornamental plants and other cultivated vegetation. There are also urban populations as far north as Sedona, Arizona, where they have been known to fill a niche similar to raccoons and other urban scavengers. In Arizona they are often called by their Spanish name &quot;javelinas&quot;. Collared peccaries are generally found in bands of 8 to 15 animals of various ages. They defend themselves if they feel threatened, but otherwise tend to ignore humans.

A second species, the white-lipped peccary (&quot;Tayassu pecari&quot;), is mainly found in rainforests of Central and South America, but also known from a wide range of other habitats such as dry forests, grasslands, mangrove, cerrado, and dry xerophytic areas. The two main threats to their survival are deforestation and hunting.

The third species, the Chacoan peccary (&quot;Catagonus wagneri&quot;). It is found in the dry shrub habitat or Chaco of Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina. The Chacoan peccary has the distinction of having been first described based on fossils and was originally thought to be an extinct species. In 1975, the animal was discovered in the Chaco region of Paraguay. The species was well known to the native people.

A fourth as yet unconfirmed species, the giant peccary (&quot;Dicotyles maximus&quot;), was described from the Brazilian Amazon and north Bolivia by Dutch biologist Marc van Roosmalen. Though relatively recently discovered, it has been known to the local Tupi people as &quot;caitetu munde&quot;, which means &quot;great peccary which lives in pairs&quot;. Thought to be the largest extant peccary, it can grow to in length. Its pelage is completely dark gray, with no collars whatsoever. Unlike other peccaries, it lives in pairs, or with one or two offspring. However, the scientific evidence for considering it as a species separate from the collared peccary has later been questioned, leading the IUCN to treat it as a synonym.

During the Late Pleistocene, two extinct peccaries, &quot;Mylohyus&quot; and &quot;Platygonus&quot;, were widespread across North America (and in the case of &quot;Platygonus&quot;, South America), but became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene around 12,000 years ago following the arrival of humans.
===Extinct genera===
In addition, Tayassuidae have a well-attested fossil record, and numerous extinct genera are known:
* †&quot;Aptenohyus&quot;
* †&quot;Cynorca&quot;
* †&quot;Egatochoerus&quot;
* †&quot;Floridachoerus&quot;
* †&quot;Macrogenis&quot;
* †&quot;Mckennahyus&quot;
* †&quot;Mylohyus&quot;
* †&quot;Platygonus&quot;
* †&quot;Prochoerus&quot;
* †&quot;Prosthennops&quot;
* †&quot;Simojovelhyus&quot;
* †&quot;Skinnerhyus&quot;

==Evolution==

Although some taxa from the Old World like the European Miocene &quot;Taucanamo&quot; have been suggested to be members of Tayussidae, their assignation to the group is equivocal, with a 2017 phylogenetic analysis recovering &quot;Taucanamo&quot; outside the clade containing suids and peccaries. The oldest unambiguous fossils of peccaries are from the Early Miocene of North America, with the North American Eocene-Oligocene genus &quot;Perchoerus,&quot; also often considered an early peccary, recovered outside the clade containing peccaries and suids.

Although common in South America today, peccaries did not reach there until about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange, when the Isthmus of Panama formed, connecting North America and South America. At that time, many North American animals—including peccaries, llamas and tapirs—entered South America, while some South American species, such as the ground sloths and opossums, migrated north. Several species of peccary across the genera &quot;Platygonus&quot; and &quot;Mylohyus&quot; remained in North America until their extinction following the colonization of the continent by humans via Beringia at the end of the Pleistocene. Today, 2 of the 3 species are relegated to the Neotropical realm, but the collared peccary ranges into northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.

==Domestication==

Peccaries bear a familial resemblance to true pigs due to their common ancestry, and are in the same suborder as swine (Suina). They have been present in South America since prehistoric times. The earliest scientific description of peccaries in the New World is in Brazil in 1547 and referred to them as &quot;wild pigs&quot;.

It has been documented that peccaries were tamed, penned, and raised for food and ritual purposes in the Yucatán, Panama, the southern Caribbean, and Colombia at the time of the Conquest. Archaeological remains of peccaries have been found in Mesoamerica from the Preclassic (or Formative) period up until immediately before Spanish contact. Specifically, peccary remains have been found at Early Formative Olmec civilization sites.

The peccary is not readily suitable for modern captive breeding, lacking suitable characteristics for intensive or semi-intensive systems. Peccaries require a higher age before they are able to give birth (parturition) and have a tendency towards infanticide.

== Relation with feral pigs ==
Recently established Brazilian boar populations are not to be confused with long-established populations of feral domestic pigs, which have existed mainly in the Pantanal for more than 100 years, along with native peccaries. The demographic dynamics of the interaction between feral pig populations and those of the two native species of peccaries (collared peccary and white-lipped peccary) is obscure and is still being studied. The existence of feral pigs could somewhat ease jaguar predation on peccary populations, as jaguars show a preference for hunting pigs when they are available.

<doc id="53664" wikidata="Q36732" url="?curid=53664" title="Kingdom (biology)">
<text>In biology, a kingdom is the second highest taxonomic rank, just below domain. Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla (singular phylum).

Traditionally, textbooks from Canada and the United States have used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaebacteria, and Bacteria or Eubacteria), while textbooks in other parts of the world, such as Bangladesh, Brazil, Greece, India, Pakistan, Spain, and the United Kingdom have used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera). 

Some recent classifications based on modern cladistics have explicitly abandoned the term &quot;kingdom&quot;, noting that some traditional kingdoms are not monophyletic, meaning that they do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor. The terms &quot;flora&quot; (for plants), &quot;fauna&quot; (for animals), and, in the 21st century, &quot;funga&quot; (for fungi) are also used for life present in a particular region or time.

== Definition and associated terms ==
When Carl Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735, the highest rank was given the name &quot;kingdom&quot; and was followed by four other main or principal ranks: class, order, genus and species. Later two further main ranks were introduced, making the sequence kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus and species. In 1990, the rank of domain was introduced above kingdom.

Prefixes can be added so &quot;subkingdom&quot; (&quot;subregnum&quot;) and &quot;infrakingdom&quot; (also known as &quot;infraregnum&quot;) are the two ranks immediately below kingdom. Superkingdom may be considered as an equivalent of domain or empire or as an independent rank between kingdom and domain or subdomain. In some classification systems the additional rank &quot;branch&quot; (Latin: &quot;ramus&quot;) can be inserted between subkingdom and infrakingdom, e.g., Protostomia and Deuterostomia in the classification of Cavalier-Smith.

== History ==
===Two kingdoms of life===

The classification of living things into animals and plants is an ancient one. Aristotle (384–322 BC) classified animal species in his &quot;History of Animals&quot;, while his pupil Theophrastus (–) wrote a parallel work, the &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot;, on plants.

Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) laid the foundations for modern biological nomenclature, now regulated by the Nomenclature Codes, in 1735. He distinguished two kingdoms of living things: &quot;Regnum Animale&quot; (&#x27;animal kingdom&#x27;) and &quot;Regnum Vegetabile&quot; (&#x27;vegetable kingdom&#x27;, for plants). Linnaeus also included minerals in his classification system, placing them in a third kingdom, &quot;Regnum Lapideum&quot;.

=== Three kingdoms of life ===

In 1674, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, often called the &quot;father of microscopy&quot;, sent the Royal Society of London a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms. Until then, the existence of such microscopic organisms was entirely unknown. Despite this, Linnaeus did not include any microscopic creatures in his original taxonomy.

At first, microscopic organisms were classified within the animal and plant kingdoms. However, by the mid–19th century, it had become clear to many that &quot;the existing dichotomy of the plant and animal kingdoms [had become] rapidly blurred at its boundaries and outmoded&quot;.

In 1860 John Hogg proposed the &quot;Protoctista&quot;, a third kingdom of life composed of &quot;all the lower creatures, or the primary organic beings&quot;; he retained Regnum Lapideum as a fourth kingdom of minerals. In 1866, Ernst Haeckel also proposed a third kingdom of life, the &quot;Protista&quot;, for &quot;neutral organisms&quot; or &quot;the kingdom of primitive forms&quot;, which were neither animal nor plant; he did not include the Regnum Lapideum in his scheme. Haeckel revised the content of this kingdom a number of times before settling on a division based on whether organisms were unicellular (Protista) or multicellular (animals and plants).

=== Four kingdoms ===
The development of microscopy revealed important distinctions between those organisms whose cells do not have a distinct nucleus (prokaryotes) and organisms whose cells do have a distinct nucleus (eukaryotes). In 1937 Édouard Chatton introduced the terms &quot;prokaryote&quot; and &quot;eukaryote&quot; to differentiate these organisms.

In 1938, Herbert F. Copeland proposed a four-kingdom classification by creating the novel Kingdom Monera of prokaryotic organisms; as a revised phylum Monera of the Protista, it included organisms now classified as Bacteria and Archaea. Ernst Haeckel, in his 1904 book &quot;The Wonders of Life&quot;, had placed the blue-green algae (or Phycochromacea) in Monera; this would gradually gain acceptance, and the blue-green algae would become classified as bacteria in the phylum Cyanobacteria.

In the 1960s, Roger Stanier and C. B. van Niel promoted and popularized Édouard Chatton&#x27;s earlier work, particularly in their paper of 1962, &quot;The Concept of a Bacterium&quot;; this created, for the first time, a rank above kingdom—a &quot;superkingdom&quot; or &quot;empire&quot;—with the two-empire system of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The two-empire system would later be expanded to the three-domain system of Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota.

=== Five kingdoms ===
The differences between fungi and other organisms regarded as plants had long been recognised by some; Haeckel had moved the fungi out of Plantae into Protista after his original classification, but was largely ignored in this separation by scientists of his time. Robert Whittaker recognized an additional kingdom for the Fungi. The resulting five-kingdom system, proposed in 1969 by Whittaker, has become a popular standard and with some refinement is still used in many works and forms the basis for new multi-kingdom systems. It is based mainly upon differences in nutrition; his Plantae were mostly multicellular autotrophs, his Animalia multicellular heterotrophs, and his Fungi multicellular saprotrophs.

The remaining two kingdoms, Protista and Monera, included unicellular and simple cellular colonies. The five kingdom system may be combined with the two empire system. In the Whittaker system, Plantae included some algae. In other systems, such as Lynn Margulis&#x27;s system of five kingdoms, the plants included just the land plants (Embryophyta), and Protoctista has a broader definition.

Following publication of Whittaker&#x27;s system, the five-kingdom model began to be commonly used in high school biology textbooks. But despite the development from two kingdoms to five among most scientists, some authors as late as 1975 continued to employ a traditional two-kingdom system of animals and plants, dividing the plant kingdom into subkingdoms Prokaryota (bacteria and cyanobacteria), Mycota (fungi and supposed relatives), and Chlorota (algae and land plants).


=== Six kingdoms ===
In 1977, Carl Woese and colleagues proposed the fundamental subdivision of the prokaryotes into the Eubacteria (later called the Bacteria) and Archaebacteria (later called the Archaea), based on ribosomal RNA structure; this would later lead to the proposal of three &quot;domains&quot; of life, of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota. Combined with the five-kingdom model, this created a six-kingdom model, where the kingdom Monera is replaced by the kingdoms Bacteria and Archaea. This six-kingdom model is commonly used in recent US high school biology textbooks, but has received criticism for compromising the current scientific consensus. But the division of prokaryotes into two kingdoms remains in use with the recent seven kingdoms scheme of Thomas Cavalier-Smith, although it primarily differs in that Protista is replaced by Protozoa and Chromista.

=== Eight kingdoms ===
Thomas Cavalier-Smith supported the consensus at that time, that the difference between Eubacteria and Archaebacteria was so great (particularly considering the genetic distance of ribosomal genes) that the prokaryotes needed to be separated into two different kingdoms. He then divided Eubacteria into two subkingdoms: Negibacteria (Gram-negative bacteria) and Posibacteria (Gram-positive bacteria). Technological advances in electron microscopy allowed the separation of the Chromista from the Plantae kingdom. Indeed, the chloroplast of the chromists is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum instead of in the cytosol. Moreover, only chromists contain chlorophyll c. Since then, many non-photosynthetic phyla of protists, thought to have secondarily lost their chloroplasts, were integrated into the kingdom Chromista.

Finally, some protists lacking mitochondria were discovered. As mitochondria were known to be the result of the endosymbiosis of a proteobacterium, it was thought that these amitochondriate eukaryotes were primitively so, marking an important step in eukaryogenesis. As a result, these amitochondriate protists were separated from the protist kingdom, giving rise to the, at the same time, superkingdom and kingdom Archezoa. This superkingdom was opposed to the Metakaryota superkingdom, grouping together the five other eukaryotic kingdoms (Animalia, Protozoa, Fungi, Plantae and Chromista). This was known as the Archezoa hypothesis, which has since been abandoned; later schemes did not include the Archezoa–Metakaryota divide.
‡ No longer recognized by taxonomists.

=== Six kingdoms (1998) ===
In 1998, Cavalier-Smith published a six-kingdom model, which has been revised in subsequent papers. The version published in 2009 is shown below. Cavalier-Smith no longer accepted the importance of the fundamental Eubacteria–Archaebacteria divide put forward by Woese and others and supported by recent research. The kingdom Bacteria (sole kingdom of empire Prokaryota) was subdivided into two sub-kingdoms according to their membrane topologies: Unibacteria and Negibacteria. Unibacteria was divided into phyla Archaebacteria and Posibacteria; the bimembranous-unimembranous transition was thought to be far more fundamental than the long branch of genetic distance of Archaebacteria, viewed as having no particular biological significance.

Cavalier-Smith does not accept the requirement for taxa to be monophyletic (&quot;holophyletic&quot; in his terminology) to be valid. He defines Prokaryota, Bacteria, Negibacteria, Unibacteria, and Posibacteria as valid paraphyla (therefore &quot;monophyletic&quot; in the sense he uses this term) taxa, marking important innovations of biological significance (in regard of the concept of biological niche).

In the same way, his paraphyletic kingdom Protozoa includes the ancestors of Animalia, Fungi, Plantae, and Chromista. The advances of phylogenetic studies allowed Cavalier-Smith to realize that all the phyla thought to be archezoans (i.e. primitively amitochondriate eukaryotes) had in fact secondarily lost their mitochondria, typically by transforming them into new organelles: Hydrogenosomes. This means that all living eukaryotes are in fact metakaryotes, according to the significance of the term given by Cavalier-Smith. Some of the members of the defunct kingdom Archezoa, like the phylum Microsporidia, were reclassified into kingdom Fungi. Others were reclassified in kingdom Protozoa, like Metamonada which is now part of infrakingdom Excavata.

Because Cavalier-Smith allows paraphyly, the diagram below is an &quot;organization chart&quot;, not an &quot;ancestor chart&quot;, and does not represent an evolutionary tree.


=== Seven kingdoms ===
Cavalier-Smith and his collaborators revised their classification in 2015. In this scheme they introduced two superkingdoms of Prokaryota and Eukaryota and seven kingdoms. Prokaryota have two kingdoms: Bacteria and Archaea. (This was based on the consensus in the Taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea, and the Catalogue of Life). The Eukaryota have five kingdoms: Protozoa, Chromista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia. In this classification a protist is any of the eukaryotic unicellular organisms.
=== Summary ===

The kingdom-level classification of life is still widely employed as a useful way of grouping organisms, notwithstanding some problems with this approach:
* Kingdoms such as Protozoa represent grades rather than clades, and so are rejected by phylogenetic classification systems.
* The most recent research does not support the classification of the eukaryotes into any of the standard systems. In 2009, Andrew Roger and Alastair Simpson emphasized the need for diligence in analyzing new discoveries: &quot;With the current pace of change in our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life, we should proceed with caution.&quot; Kingdoms are rarely used in academic phylogeny and are more common in introductory education, where 5-6 kingdom models are preferred.

== Beyond traditional kingdoms ==
While the concept of kingdoms continues to be used by some taxonomists, there has been a movement away from traditional kingdoms, as they are no longer seen as providing a cladistic classification, where there is emphasis in arranging organisms into natural groups.

=== Three domains of life ===

Based on RNA studies, Carl Woese thought life could be divided into three large divisions and referred to them as the &quot;three primary kingdom&quot; model or &quot;urkingdom&quot; model.

In 1990, the name &quot;domain&quot; was proposed for the highest rank. This term represents a synonym for the category of dominion (lat. dominium), introduced by Moore in 1974. Unlike Moore, Woese et al. (1990) did not suggest a Latin term for this category, which represents a further argument supporting the accurately introduced term dominion.

Woese divided the prokaryotes (previously classified as the Kingdom Monera) into two groups, called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, stressing that there was as much genetic difference between these two groups as between either of them and all eukaryotes.

According to genetic data, although eukaryote groups such as plants, fungi, and animals may look different, they are more closely related to each other than they are to either the Eubacteria or Archaea. It was also found that the eukaryotes are more closely related to the Archaea than they are to the Eubacteria. Although the primacy of the Eubacteria-Archaea divide has been questioned, it has been upheld by subsequent research. There is no consensus on how many kingdoms exist in the classification scheme proposed by Woese.

=== Eukaryotic supergroups ===

In 2004, a review article by Simpson and Roger noted that the Protista were &quot;a grab-bag for all eukaryotes that are not animals, plants or fungi&quot;. They held that only monophyletic groups should be accepted as formal ranks in a classification and that – while this approach had been impractical previously (necessitating &quot;literally dozens of eukaryotic &#x27;kingdoms) – it had now become possible to divide the eukaryotes into &quot;just a few major groups that are probably all monophyletic&quot;.

On this basis, the diagram opposite (redrawn from their article) showed the real &quot;kingdoms&quot; (their quotation marks) of the eukaryotes. A classification which followed this approach was produced in 2005 for the International Society of Protistologists, by a committee which &quot;worked in collaboration with specialists from many societies&quot;. It divided the eukaryotes into the same six &quot;supergroups&quot;. The published classification deliberately did not use formal taxonomic ranks, including that of &quot;kingdom&quot;.

In this system the multicellular animals (Metazoa) are descended from the same ancestor as both the unicellular choanoflagellates and the fungi which form the Opisthokonta. Plants are thought to be more distantly related to animals and fungi.

However, in the same year as the International Society of Protistologists&#x27; classification was published (2005), doubts were being expressed as to whether some of these supergroups were monophyletic, particularly the Chromalveolata, and a review in 2006 noted the lack of evidence for several of the six proposed supergroups.

, there is widespread agreement that the Rhizaria belong with the Stramenopiles and the Alveolata, in a clade dubbed the SAR supergroup, so that Rhizaria is not one of the main eukaryote groups. 

=== Prokaryotic kingdoms ===

The &quot;Prokaryotic Code&quot; treats Bacteria and Archaea each as a domain. Since 2024, each domain each contains 4 kingdoms, for a total of 8.

=== Comparison of top level classification ===
Some authors have added non-cellular life to their classifications. This can create a &quot;superdomain&quot; called &quot;Acytota&quot;, also called &quot;Aphanobionta&quot;, of non-cellular life; with the other superdomain being &quot;cytota&quot; or cellular life.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmidhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26305806/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (see section below for further discussion)

The eocyte hypothesis proposes that the eukaryotes emerged from a phylum within the archaea called the Thermoproteota (formerly known as eocytes or Crenarchaeota).

== Viruses ==
The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses uses the taxonomic rank &quot;kingdom&quot; in the classification of viruses (with the suffix &quot;-virae&quot;); but this is beneath the top level classifications of realm and subrealm.

There is ongoing debate as to whether viruses can be included in the tree of life. The arguments against include the fact that they are obligate intracellular parasites that lack metabolism and are not capable of replication outside of a host cell. Another argument is that their placement in the tree would be problematic, since it is suspected that viruses have various evolutionary origins, and they have a penchant for harvesting nucleotide sequences from their hosts.
