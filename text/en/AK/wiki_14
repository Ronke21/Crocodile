<text>Representative democracy, electoral democracy or indirect democracy is a type of democracy where representatives are elected by the public. Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic). This is different from direct democracy, where the public votes directly on laws or policies, rather than representatives.

Political parties often become prominent in representative democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives). Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy.

Representative democracy can be organized in different ways including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber (unicameral), two chambers (bicameral), or more than two chambers (multicameral). Where two or more chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways. The power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power:

*An independent judiciary, which may have the power to declare legislative acts unconstitutional (e.g. constitutional court, supreme court).
*The constitution may also provide for some deliberative democracy (e.g., Royal Commissions) or direct popular measures (e.g., initiative, referendum, recall elections). However, these are not always binding and usually require some legislative action—legal power usually remains firmly with representatives. 
*In some cases, a bicameral legislature may have an &quot;upper house&quot; that is not directly elected, such as the Senate of Canada, which was in turn modeled on the British House of Lords.

Some political theorists, such as Edmund Burke, believe that part of the duty of a representative is not simply to follow the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters. A representative who chooses to execute the wishes of their constituents acts as a delegate. If the representative chooses to use their best judgment and knowledge in making decisions, even when the constituents do not fully agree with the decision, then the representative acts as a trustee.

==History==

The Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries, and today&#x27;s modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems.

In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states.

In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848.

Representative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states where large numbers of citizens evinced interest in politics, but where technology and population figures remained unsuited to direct democracy. Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom.

Globally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches.

==Research on representation democracy ==

Separate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes to the detriment of the population at large.

==Criticisms==
In his book &quot;Political Parties&quot;, written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy.
Representative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book &quot;Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas&quot; which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947. Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: 
* Society has to be built up from bottom to top. As a consequence, society is built up by people, who are free and have the power to defend themselves with weapons.
* These free people join or form local communities. These local communities are independent, which includes financial independence, and they are free to determine their own rules.
* Local communities join into a higher unit, e.g. a canton.
* There is no hierarchical bureaucracy.
* There is competition between these local communities, e.g. on services delivered or on taxes.

A drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance. Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized.

Proponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system.

===Proposed solutions===
The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book &quot;La Stochocratie&quot;. Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs.

The system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.

<text>Livable Netherlands (, LN) was a Dutch political party. Pim Fortuyn began his political career in the party.

==History==
Historically there have always been parties in States Provincial (provincial legislatures) and municipal councils that were independent from the national party system. In the predominantly Catholic south of the Netherlands during the 1950s, the Catholic People&#x27;s Party gained eighty percent of the vote in national elections, local and provincial groups of independents were organised.

During the 1980s, independent parties began to spread to other parts of the Netherlands. Some successful groups like Independent Rijswijk began to move towards a national movement. A congress for this purpose held in 1989 did not result in much progress towards this goal, although independent parties were still very successful in municipal elections especially in Hilversum and Utrecht.

Some of them chose the name &quot;Leefbaar&quot; (&quot;liveable&quot;). It became a distinct political movement. It was not a party in itself but consisted of many municipal branches. These branches had no formal ties, and often had radically different programs, sharing only their disdain for the political establishment.

In 1999, prominent media personalities Henk Westbroek and Jan Nagel, chairs of the highly successful Leefbaar Utrecht and Leefbaar Hilversum parties respectively, founded Leefbaar Nederland as a spin-off from their local parties. Nagel became the party&#x27;s chair. Nagel had previously been chair of the VARA, a broadcaster linked to the Labour Party.

In 2001, the party&#x27;s support and visibility began to increase. They came to be seen as an opposition movement against the second Kok cabinet. In November 2001 Pim Fortuyn was elected as the party&#x27;s lead candidate and LN saw rapid growth in opinion polls. On 10 February, a few months before the election, he was discharged because of a controversial interview published in the Volkskrant newspaper. Fortuyn subsequently organised his own party, the Pim Fortuyn List, taking several former LN parliamentary candidates and members with him. On 10 March the Amsterdam public prosecutor Fred Teeven was chosen as new lead candidate. In the election of May 2002, the party won only two seats in the House of Representatives while the Pim Fortuyn List polled in second place with 26 seats.

In the election of 2003, self-help guru Emile Ratelband was put forward by the party board as their candidate for the lead candidate position. Teeven, who had gained some recognition as MP, withdrew his candidacy for the position when a motion of no confidence was not supported by the party&#x27;s congress. During a tumultuous congress, the 22-year-old Haitske van der Linde, the daughter of TV personality Wubbo van der Linde and candidate of the party&#x27;s youth movement J@L, was elected lead candidate. She was unable to hold on to the two seats the party held, and the party left parliament. Ratelband, who had formed his own list, was still less successful in the polls. The party tried to dissolve itself, but there were not enough members present at the congress to do that, and the party left the public spotlight. In 2006, the party announced that it would disband itself: it owed a large debt to the Ministry of the Interior, who had lent them money for the 2003 election, and only a handful of paying members were left.

==Name==
The term &quot;Leefbaar&quot; was turned into a political brand by the Leefbaar Utrecht and Hilversum parties; the founders tried to reproduce this success by taking over the name.

==Ideology and issues==
The party was a populist party, oriented towards democratising society and solving several difficult political issues pragmatically. The party saw itself as a movement against the &#x27;old parties&#x27; and especially those cooperating in the second Kok cabinet and sought not to characterize itself on the traditional left-right political spectrum. The core principles of the party included direct democracy, reliable government, downsizing state bureaucracy and law &amp; order policies.

They had a ten-point plan which included:
* implementing referendums
* combatting bureaucracy
* strengthening the citizen&#x27;s say over their own life.
* a just asylum seeker policy

==Representation==
===House of Representatives===
The party were unable to ever obtain any European Parliament or Senate seats. Their support came mostly from independent voters, who no longer felt connected to a particular party.

===Municipal and Provincial Government===
The municipal and local Leefbaar parties were not an official part of the party. Some of these parties, most notably Livable Rotterdam were however founded around the same time hoping to gain from the same momentum. Many of these parties are represented in provincial and municipal councils and cooperated in several municipal executives. They were highly successful in the 2002 municipal elections, but lost much of their support in the 2006 municipal elections.

==Organisation==

===Organisational structure===
The highest organ of LN was the Congress in which every member could participate. It convened once every year. It appointed the party board and decided the order of the House of Representatives, Senate and European Parliament candidate lists and had the final say over the party program.

===Linked organisations===
The party&#x27;s youth organisation was called Jong@Leefbaar.nl (Young@Livable.nl; J@L). The party published &quot;De Leefbaar Koerier&quot; (Livable Courier). The scientific institute of the party was called Foundation Scientific Bureau Livable Netherlands, which published &quot;De Fundering&quot; (The Foundation).

==International comparison==
Internationally, Leefbaar Nederland may be compared to Forza Italia, a populist party centered on a prominent media personality.

<text>Freedom House is a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. It is best known for political advocacy surrounding issues of democracy, political freedom, and human rights. Freedom House was founded in October 1941, with Wendell Willkie and Eleanor Roosevelt serving as its first honorary chairpersons. Most of the organization&#x27;s funding comes from the U.S. State Department and other government grants. It also receives funds from various semi-public and private foundations, as well as individual contributions.

The organization&#x27;s annual &quot;Freedom in the World&quot; report assesses each country&#x27;s degree of political freedoms and civil liberties. Another key annual report, &quot;Freedom on the Net&quot;, is Freedom House&#x27;s annual survey and analysis of internet freedom around the world. While often cited by political scientists, journalists, and policymakers, the organization&#x27;s democracy indices have received criticism.

Between the 1970s and 2000s, critics predominately alleged that the organization was biased towards American interests due to government funding; others criticized the organization&#x27;s reliance on democratic indices created near-exclusively by Raymond Gastil. In 2018, the rankings were criticized by &quot;National Review&quot;, a conservative newspaper, for its perceptions of the NGO being &quot;anti-conservative&quot;.

==History==
Freedom House was incorporated October 31, 1941. Among its founders were Eleanor Roosevelt, Wendell Willkie, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, Elizabeth Cutter Morrow, Dorothy Thompson, George Field, Herbert Agar, Herbert Bayard Swope, Ralph Bunche, Father George B. Ford, Roscoe Drummond and Rex Stout. George Field (1904–2006) was executive director of the organization until his retirement in 1967.

According to its website, Freedom House was founded in 1941. Several groups were aggressively supporting U.S. entry into World War II and in early autumn 1941, when various group activities began to overlap, the Fight for Freedom Committee began exploring a mass merger. George Field then conceived the idea of all of the groups maintaining their separate identities under one roof—Freedom House—to promote the concrete application of the principles of freedom.

Freedom House had physical form in a New York City building that represented the organization&#x27;s goals. A converted residence at 32 East 51st Street opened January 22, 1942, as a centre &quot;where all who love liberty may meet, plan their programs and encourage one another&quot;. Furnished as a gift of the Allies, the 19-room building included a broadcasting facility. In January 1944, Freedom House moved to 5 West 54th Street, a former residence that Robert Lehman lent to the organization.

Freedom House sponsored influential radio programs including &quot;The Voice of Freedom&quot; (1942–43) and &quot;Our Secret Weapon&quot; (1942–43), a CBS radio series created to counter Axis shortwave radio propaganda broadcasts. Rex Stout, chairman of the Writers&#x27; War Board and representative of Freedom House, would rebut the most entertaining lies of the week. The series was produced by Paul White, founder of CBS News.

By November 1944, Freedom House was planning to raise money to acquire a building to be named after the recently deceased Wendell L. Willkie. In 1945 an elegant building at 20 West 40th Street was purchased to house the organization. It was named the Willkie Memorial Building.

After the war, as its website states, &quot;Freedom House took up the struggle against the other twentieth century totalitarian threat, Communism ... The organization&#x27;s leadership was convinced that the spread of democracy would be the best weapon against totalitarian ideologies.&quot; Freedom House supported the Marshall Plan and the establishment of NATO. Freedom House also supported the Johnson Administration&#x27;s Vietnam War policies.

Freedom House was highly critical of McCarthyism. During the 1950s and 1960s, it supported the Civil Rights Movement in the United States and its leadership included several prominent civil rights activiststhough it was sometimes critical of civil rights leaders for their anti-war activism, Freedom House awarded Martin Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers its annual Freedom Award in 1963. It supported Andrei Sakharov, other Soviet dissidents, and the Solidarity movement in Poland. Freedom House assisted the post-Communist societies in the establishment of independent media, non-governmental think tanks, and the core institutions of electoral politics.

The organization describes itself currently as a clear voice for democracy and freedom around the world. Freedom House states that it:

In 1967, Freedom House absorbed Books USA, which had been created several years earlier by Edward R. Murrow, as a joint venture between the Peace Corps and the United States Information Service.

Since 2001, Freedom House has supported citizens involved in challenges to the existing regimes in Serbia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere. The organization states, &quot;From South Africa to Jordan, Kyrgyzstan to Indonesia, Freedom House has partnered with regional activists in bolstering civil society; worked to support women&#x27;s rights; sought justice for victims of torture; defended journalists and free expression advocates; and assisted those struggling to promote human rights in challenging political environments.&quot; However, alternative classifications have produced significantly different results from those of the FH for Latin American countries.

==Organization==
Freedom House is a nonprofit organization with approximately 300 staff members worldwide. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., it has field offices in about a dozen countries, including Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Jordan, Mexico, and also countries in Central Asia.

Freedom House states that its board of trustees is composed of &quot;business and labor leaders, former senior government officials, scholars, writers, and journalists&quot;. All board members are current residents of the United States. Past members of the organization&#x27;s board of directors include Kenneth Adelman, Farooq Kathwari, Azar Nafisi, Mark Palmer, P. J. O&#x27;Rourke and Lawrence Lessig, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Samuel Huntington, Mara Liasson, Otto Reich, Donald Rumsfeld, Whitney North Seymour, Paul Wolfowitz, Steve Forbes and Bayard Rustin.

=== Funding ===
According to their 2022 financial statement and independent auditors&#x27; report, Freedom House reported $93,705,255 of total revenue:

* Federal grants – $79,606,961
* International public agencies – $1,055,339 ($3,826,812 with donor restrictions)
* Corporations and foundations – $1,873,651 ($5,849,073 with donor restrictions)
* Individual contributions – $1,487,190
* Net assets released from restrictions – $2,901,964

Freedom House&#x27;s total expenses in 2022 were $85,530,680.

==Reports==
===&quot;Freedom in the World&quot;===


Since 1973, Freedom House publishes an annual report, &quot;Freedom in the World&quot;, which it seeks to assess the current state of civil liberties and political rights in 195 countries and 15 territories.

Freedom House&#x27;s methods (around 1990) and other democracy-researchers were mentioned as examples of an expert-based evaluation by sociologist Kenneth A. Bollen, who is also an applied statistician. Bollen writes that expert-based evaluations are prone to statistical bias of an unknown direction, that is, not known either to agree with U.S. policy or to disagree with U.S. policy: &quot;Regardless of the direction of distortions, it is highly likely that every set of indicators formed by a single author or organization contains systematic measurement error. The origin of this measure lies in the common methodology of forming measures. Selectivity of information and various traits of the judges fuse into a distinct form of bias that is likely to characterize all indicators from a common publication.&quot;

===&quot;Freedom of the Press&quot;===
The &quot;Freedom of the Press&quot; index was an annual survey of media independence, published between 1980 and 2017. It assessed the degree of print, broadcast, and internet freedom throughout the world, classifying nation-states as &quot;free&quot;, &quot;partly-free&quot;, and &quot;not-free&quot; as a result. 

An independent review of press freedom studies, commissioned by the Knight Foundation in 2006, found that FOP was the best in its class of Press Freedom Indicators.

===&quot;Freedom on the Net&quot;===
The &quot;Freedom on the Net&quot; reports provide analytical reports and numerical ratings regarding the state of Internet freedom for countries worldwide.

Freedom on the Net&#x27;s report covers a range of concepts that the other datasets do not, such as new legislation passed, but lacks the country coverage of other datasets. 

Expert surveys on the internet by the likes of Freedom House and V-Dem have been found to be more prone to false positives, while the remote sensing research by Access Now and the OpenNet Initiative are more likely to be prone to false negatives.

The Millennium Challenge Corporation used the Key Internet Controls portion of the Freedom on the Net report to inform its country selection process until 2020 when this report was replaced with data on internet shutdowns from Access Now.

==Criticism==

=== Relationship with the U.S. government ===
In 2006, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Freedom House had received funding by the State Department for &quot;clandestine activities&quot; inside Iran. According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Some academics, activists and those involved in the growing US business of spreading freedom and democracy are alarmed that such semi-covert activities risk damaging the public and transparent work of other organisations, and will backfire inside Iran.&quot;

On December 7, 2004, former U.S. House Representative and Libertarian politician Ron Paul criticized Freedom House for allegedly administering a U.S.-funded program in Ukraine where &quot;much of that money was targeted to assist one particular candidate.&quot; Paul said &quot;one part that we do know thus far is that the U.S. government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), granted millions of dollars to the Poland-America-Ukraine Cooperation Initiative (PAUCI), which is administered by the U.S.-based Freedom House. PAUCI then sent U.S. Government funds to numerous Ukrainian non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This would be bad enough and would in itself constitute meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation. But, what is worse is that many of these grantee organizations in Ukraine are blatantly in favor of presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko.&quot;

Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman have criticized the organization for excessively criticizing states opposed to US interests while being unduly sympathetic to regimes supportive of US interests. Most notably, Freedom House described the 1979 Rhodesian general election as &quot;fair&quot;, but described the 1980 Southern Rhodesian general election as &quot;dubious&quot;, and found the 1982 Salvadoran presidential election to be &quot;admirable&quot;.

===Cuban, Sudanese, and Chinese criticism===
In May 2001, the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations of the United Nations heard arguments for and against Freedom House. Representatives of Cuba said that the organization is a U.S. foreign policy instrument linked to the CIA and &quot;submitted proof of the politically motivated, interventionist activities the NGO (Freedom House) carried out against their Government&quot;. They also claimed a lack of criticism of U.S. human rights violations in the annual reports. Cuba also stated that these violations are well documented by other reports, such as those of Human Rights Watch. Other countries such as China and Sudan also gave criticism. The Russian representative inquired &quot;why this organization, an NGO which defended human rights, was against the creation of the International Criminal Court?&quot;

The U.S. representative stated that alleged links between Freedom House and the CIA were &quot;simply not true&quot;. The representative said he agreed that the NGO receives funds from the United States Government, but said this is disclosed in its reports. The representative said the funds were from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was not a branch of the CIA. The representative said his country had a law prohibiting the government from engaging in the activities of organizations seeking to change public policy, such as Freedom House. The representative said his country was not immune from criticism from Freedom House, which he said was well documented. The U.S. representative further argued that Freedom House was a human rights organization which sought to represent those who did not have a voice. The representative said he would continue to support NGOs who criticized his government and those of others.

In December 2019, Freedom House, together with four other U.S.-based democracy and human rights organizations, was sanctioned by the Chinese government. In August 2020, then Freedom House president Michael Abramowitz, together with the heads of the same four groups and six U.S. Republican lawmakers, were also sanctioned, with the Chinese foreign ministry saying these individuals had &quot;blatantly intervened in Hong Kong affairs, grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs, and seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations&quot;. The leaders of the five organizations saw the sanctioning, whose details were unspecified, as a tit-for-tat measure in response to the earlier sanctioning by the U.S. of 11 Hong Kong officials. The latter step had in turn been a reaction to the enactment of the Hong Kong National Security Law at the end of June.

===Russia===
Russia, identified by Freedom House as &quot;Not Free&quot;, called Freedom House biased and accused the group of serving U.S. interests. Sergei Markov, an MP from the ruling United Russia party, called Freedom House a &quot;Russophobic&quot; organization, commenting: &quot;You can listen to everything they say, except when it comes to Russia ... There are many Russophobes there.&quot; Christopher Walker, director of studies at Freedom House, posited that Freedom House made its evaluations based on objective criteria explained on the organization&#x27;s website, and denied that it had a pro-U.S. agenda, saying: &quot;If you look closely at the 193 countries that we evaluate, you&#x27;ll find that we criticize what are often considered strategic allies of the United States.&quot;

UCLA political scientist Daniel Treisman has criticized Freedom House&#x27;s assessment of Russia. Treisman cited that Freedom House ranks Russia&#x27;s political rights on the same level as the United Arab Emirates, which is a federation of absolute monarchies with no element of democracy within the system. Freedom House also ranks Russia&#x27;s civil liberties on the same scale as those of Yemen, where criticism of the president was illegal. Treisman contrasts Freedom House&#x27;s ranking with the Polity IV scale used by academics, in which Russia has a much better score. In 2018, the Polity IV scale scored the United Arab Emirates at -8, Russia at +4, and the United States at +8.

In May 2024, Russian authorities declared Freedom House an “undesirable organization”.

===Alleged partiality toward Uzbekistan===
Craig Murray, the British ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2002 to 2004, wrote that the executive director of Freedom House told him in 2003 that the group decided to back off from its efforts to spotlight human rights abuses in Uzbekistan, because some Republican board members (in Murray&#x27;s words) &quot;expressed concern that Freedom House was failing to keep in sight the need to promote freedom in the widest sense, by giving full support to U.S. and coalition forces&quot;. Human rights abuses in Uzbekistan at the time included the killing of prisoners by &quot;immersion in boiling liquid&quot;, and by strapping on a gas mask and blocking the filters, Murray reported. Jennifer Windsor, the executive director of Freedom House in 2003, replied that Murray&#x27;s &quot;characterization of our conversation is an inexplicable misrepresentation not only of what was said at that meeting, but of Freedom House&#x27;s record in Uzbekistan ... Freedom House has been a consistent and harsh critic of the human rights situation in Uzbekistan, as clearly demonstrated in press releases and in our annual assessments of that country&quot;.

=== Overemphasis on formal aspects of democracy ===
According to one study, Freedom House&#x27;s rankings &quot;overemphasize the more formal aspects of democracy while failing to capture the informal but real power relations and pathways of influence ... and frequently lead to de facto deviations from democracy.&quot; States can therefore &quot;look formally liberal-democratic but might be rather illiberal in their actual workings&quot;

===Criticism from American conservatives===
In the 2010s, a number of American conservative institutions have criticized Freedom House for what they see as an anti-conservative shift in the organization; the organization has been criticized as being biased against conservative governments and the policies they enact, and has also been accused of favoring progressive and left-wing ideas in its ranking system. It has also been criticized for a perceived shift to an activist mindset; a 2018 article in the &quot;National Review&quot; described it as having &quot;changed dramatically since its anti-Communist days during the Cold War&quot; and having &quot;become simply another progressive, anti-conservative (and overwhelmingly government-dependent) NGO&quot;. Another article criticized Freedom House for characterizing differences in policy as anti-democratic and for using what it regarded as partisan rather than objective measures of democracy.
===Criticism from Vietnam===
As Vietnam is a one-party socialist state, it is a frequent target for criticism and accusations from Freedom House, resulting in strong responses and criticism made by Vietnamese media against the organization.

The section about Vietnam in Freedom on the Net publication is criticized by Vietnamese state media, as Freedom House accuses Vietnam to not have Internet freedom in this publication.

==Chronology of systematic evaluations==
From the 1970s until 1990, Raymond Gastil practically produced the reports on his own, though sometimes with help from his wife. Gastil himself described it in 1990 as &quot;a loose, intuitive rating system for levels of freedom or democracy, as defined by the traditional political rights and civil liberties of the Western democracies.&quot; Regarding criticisms of his reports, he said: &quot;generally such criticism is based on opinions about Freedom House rather than detailed examination of survey ratings&quot;.

In a 1986 report on the methodology used by Gastil and others to create &quot;Freedom in the World&quot; report, Kenneth A. Bollen noted some bias but found that &quot;no criticisms of which I am aware have demonstrated a systematic bias in all the ratings. Most of the evidence consists of anecdotal evidence of relatively few cases. Whether there is a systematic or sporadic slant in Gastil&#x27;s ratings is an open question&quot;. In a later report by Bollen and Pamela Paxton in 2000, they concluded that from 1972 to 1988 (a specific period they observed), there was &quot;unambiguous evidence of judge-specific measurement errors, which are related to traits of the countries.&quot; They estimated that Gastil&#x27;s method produced a bias of 0.38 standard deviations (s.d.) against Communist countries and a larger bias, 0.5 s.d., favoring Christian countries.

In 2001, a study by Mainwaring, Brink, and Perez-Linanhe found the Freedom Index of &quot;Freedom in the World&quot; to have a strong positive correlation (at least 80%) with three other democracy indices. Mainwaring &quot;et al.&quot; wrote that Freedom House&#x27;s index had &quot;two systematic biases: scores for leftist were tainted by political considerations, and changes in scores are sometimes driven by changes in their criteria rather than changes in real conditions&quot;. Nonetheless, when evaluated on Latin American countries yearly, Freedom House&#x27;s index was positively correlated with the index of Adam Przeworski and with the index of the authors themselves. However, according to Przeworski in 2003, the definition of freedom in Gastil (1982) and Freedom House (1990) emphasized liberties rather than the exercise of freedom. He gave the following example: In the United States, citizens are free to form political parties and to vote, yet even in presidential elections only half of U.S. citizens vote; in the U.S., &quot;the same two parties speak in a commercially sponsored unison&quot;.

A 2014 report by comparative politics researcher Nils D. Steiner found &quot;strong and consistent evidence of a substantial bias in the FH ratings&quot; before 1988, with bias being reflected by the relationships between the U.S. and the countries under investigation. He writes that after 1989 the findings were not as strong but still hinted at political bias. In 2017, Sarah Sunn Bush wrote that many critics found the original pre-1990 methodology lacking. While this improved after a team was hired in 1990, she says some criticism remains. As for why the Freedom House index is most often quoted in the United States, she notes that its definition of democracy is closely aligned with US foreign policy. US-allied countries tend to get better scores than in other reports. However, because the report is important to US lawmakers and politicians, weaker states seeking US aid or favor are forced to respond to the reports, giving the Freedom House significant influence in those places.

<doc id="52324" wikidata="Q3343298" url="?curid=52324" title="Non-departmental public body">
<text>In the United Kingdom, non-departmental public body (NDPB) is a classification applied by the Cabinet Office, Treasury, the Scottish Government, and the Northern Ireland Executive to public sector organisations that have a role in the process of national government but are not part of a government department. NDPBs carry out their work largely independently from ministers and are accountable to the public through Parliament; however, ministers are responsible for the independence, effectiveness, and efficiency of non-departmental public bodies in their portfolio.

The term includes the four types of NDPB (executive, advisory, tribunal, and independent monitoring boards) but excludes public corporations and public broadcasters (BBC, Channel 4, and S4C).

==Types of body==
The UK Government classifies bodies into four main types. The Scottish Government also has a fifth category: NHS bodies.

===Advisory NDPBs===
These bodies consist of boards which advise ministers on particular policy areas. They are often supported by a small secretariat from the parent department, and any expenditure is paid for by that department.

===Executive NDPBs===
These bodies usually deliver a particular public service and are overseen by a board rather than ministers. Appointments are made by ministers following the Code of Practice of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. They employ their own staff and allocate their own budgets.

===Tribunal NDPBs===

These bodies have jurisdiction over an area of the law. They are coordinated by His Majesty&#x27;s Courts and Tribunals Service, an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice, and supervised by the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, itself an NDPB sponsored by the Ministry of Justice.

===Independent monitoring boards===

These bodies were formerly known as &quot;boards of visitors&quot; and are responsible for the state of prisons, their administration, and the treatment of prisoners. The Home Office is responsible for their costs and has to note all expenses.

==Contrast with executive agencies, non-ministerial departments and quangos==
NDPB differ from executive agencies as they are not created to carry out ministerial orders or policy, instead they are more or less self-determining and enjoy greater independence. They are also not directly part of government like a non-ministerial government department being at a remove from both ministers and any elected assembly or parliament. Typically an NDPB would be established under statute and be accountable to Parliament rather than to His Majesty&#x27;s Government. This arrangement allows more financial independence since the government is obliged to provide funding to meet statutory obligations.

NDPBs are sometimes referred to as quangos. However, this term originally referred to quasi-NGOs bodies that are, at least ostensibly, non-government organisations, but nonetheless perform governmental functions. The backronym &quot;quasi-autonomous national government organization&quot; is used in this usage which is normally pejorative.

==History, numbers and powers==
In March 2009 there were nearly 800 public bodies that were sponsored by the UK Government. This total included 198 executive NDPBs, 410 advisory bodies, 33 tribunals, 21 public corporations, the Bank of England, 2 public broadcasting authorities and 23 NHS bodies. However, the classification is conservative and does not include bodies that are the responsibility of devolved government, various lower tier boards (including a considerable number within the NHS), and also other boards operating in the public sector (e.g. school governors and police authorities).

These appointed bodies performed a large variety of tasks, for example health trusts, or the Welsh Development Agency, and by 1992 were responsible for some 25% of all government expenditure in the UK. According to the Cabinet Office their total expenditure for the financial year 2005–06 was £167 billion. 

As of March 2020, there were 237 non-departmental public bodies. 

==Criticism==
Critics argued that the system was open to abuse as most NDPBs had their members directly appointed by government ministers without an election or consultation with the people. The press, critical of what was perceived as the Conservatives&#x27; complacency in power in the 1990s, presented much material interpreted as evidence of questionable government practices.

This concern led to the formation of a Committee on Standards in Public Life (the Nolan Committee) which first reported in 1995 and recommended the creation of a &quot;public appointments commissioner&quot; to make sure that appropriate standards were met in the appointment of members of NDPBs. The Government accepted the recommendation, and the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments was established in November 1995.

While in opposition, the Labour Party promised to reduce the number and power of NDPBs. The use of NDPBs continued under the Labour government in office from 1997 to 2010, though the political controversy associated with NDPBs in the mid-1990s for the most part died away.

In 2010 the UK&#x27;s Conservative-Liberal coalition published a review of NDPBs recommending closure or merger of nearly two hundred bodies, and the transfer of others to the private sector. This process was colloquially termed the &quot;bonfire of the quangos&quot;.

== Classification in national accounts ==
NDPBs are classified under code S.13112 of the European System of Accounts (ESA.95). However, Statistics UK does not break out the detail for these bodies and they are consolidated into General Government (S.1311).

<text>In abstract algebra, a cyclic group or monogenous group is a group, denoted C&quot;n&quot; (also frequently formula_1&quot;n&quot; or Z&quot;n&quot;, not to be confused with the commutative ring of -adic numbers), that is generated by a single element. That is, it is a set of invertible elements with a single associative binary operation, and it contains an element &quot;g&quot; such that every other element of the group may be obtained by repeatedly applying the group operation to &quot;g&quot; or its inverse. Each element can be written as an integer power of &quot;g&quot; in multiplicative notation, or as an integer multiple of &quot;g&quot; in additive notation. This element &quot;g&quot; is called a &quot;generator&quot; of the group.

Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group of Z, the integers. Every finite cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot; is isomorphic to the additive group of [[Cyclic group|Z]]/&quot;n[[Cyclic group|&quot;Z]], the integers modulo &quot;n&quot;. Every cyclic group is an abelian group (meaning that its group operation is commutative), and every finitely generated abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups.

Every cyclic group of prime order is a simple group, which cannot be broken down into smaller groups. In the classification of finite simple groups, one of the three infinite classes consists of the cyclic groups of prime order. The cyclic groups of prime order are thus among the building blocks from which all groups can be built.

==Definition and notation==
For any element &quot;g&quot; in any group &quot;G&quot;, one can form the subgroup that consists of all its integer powers: , called the cyclic subgroup generated by &quot;g&quot;. The order of &quot;g&quot; is |⟨&quot;g&quot;⟩|, the number of elements in ⟨&quot;g&quot;⟩, conventionally abbreviated as |&quot;g&quot;|, as ord(&quot;g&quot;), or as o(&quot;g&quot;). That is, the order of an element is equal to the order of the cyclic subgroup that it generates.

A &quot;cyclic group&quot; is a group which is equal to one of its cyclic subgroups: for some element &quot;g&quot;, called a &quot;generator&quot; of &quot;G&quot;.

For a finite cyclic group &quot;G&quot; of order &quot;n&quot; we have , where &quot;e&quot; is the identity element and whenever (mod &quot;n&quot;); in particular , and . An abstract group defined by this multiplication is often denoted C&quot;n&quot;, and we say that &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to the standard cyclic group C&quot;n&quot;. Such a group is also isomorphic to Z/&quot;n&quot;Z, the group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot; with the addition operation, which is the standard cyclic group in additive notation. Under the isomorphism &quot;χ&quot; defined by the identity element &quot;e&quot; corresponds to 0, products correspond to sums, and powers correspond to multiples.

For example, the set of complex 6th roots of unity: formula_2 forms a group under multiplication. It is cyclic, since it is generated by the primitive root formula_3 that is, &quot;G&quot; = ⟨&quot;z&quot;⟩ = { 1, &quot;z&quot;, &quot;z&quot;2, &quot;z&quot;3, &quot;z&quot;4, &quot;z&quot;5 } with &quot;z&quot;6 = 1. Under a change of letters, this is isomorphic to (structurally the same as) the standard cyclic group of order 6, defined as C6 = ⟨&quot;g&quot;⟩ = with multiplication &quot;g&quot;&quot;j&quot; · &quot;g&quot;&quot;k&quot; = &quot;g&quot;&quot;j&quot;+&quot;k&quot; (mod 6), so that &quot;g&quot;6 = &quot;g&quot;0 = &quot;e&quot;. These groups are also isomorphic to Z/6Z = with the operation of addition modulo 6, with &quot;z&quot;&quot;k&quot; and &quot;g&quot;&quot;k&quot; corresponding to &quot;k&quot;. For example, corresponds to , and corresponds to , and so on. Any element generates its own cyclic subgroup, such as ⟨&quot;z&quot;2⟩ = of order 3, isomorphic to C3 and Z/3Z; and ⟨&quot;z&quot;5⟩ = { &quot;e&quot;, &quot;z&quot;5, &quot;z&quot;10 = &quot;z&quot;4, &quot;z&quot;15 = &quot;z&quot;3, &quot;z&quot;20 = &quot;z&quot;2, &quot;z&quot;25 = &quot;z&quot; } = &quot;G&quot;, so that &quot;z&quot;5 has order 6 and is an alternative generator of &quot;G&quot;.

Instead of the quotient notations Z/&quot;n&quot;Z, Z/(&quot;n&quot;), or Z/&quot;n&quot;, some authors denote a finite cyclic group as Z&quot;n&quot;, but this clashes with the notation of number theory, where Z&quot;p&quot; denotes a &quot;p&quot;-adic number ring, or localization at a prime ideal.
On the other hand, in an infinite cyclic group , the powers &quot;g&quot;&quot;k&quot; give distinct elements for all integers &quot;k&quot;, so that &quot;G&quot; = , and &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to the standard group and to Z, the additive group of the integers. An example is the first frieze group. Here there are no finite cycles, and the name &quot;cyclic&quot; may be misleading.

To avoid this confusion, Bourbaki introduced the term monogenous group for a group with a single generator and restricted &quot;cyclic group&quot; to mean a finite monogenous group, avoiding the term &quot;infinite cyclic group&quot;.
==Examples==
===Integer and modular addition===
The set of integers Z, with the operation of addition, forms a group. It is an infinite cyclic group, because all integers can be written by repeatedly adding or subtracting the single number 1. In this group, 1 and −1 are the only generators. Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to Z.

For every positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the set of integers modulo &quot;n&quot;, again with the operation of addition, forms a finite cyclic group, denoted Z/&quot;n&quot;Z.
A modular integer &quot;i&quot; is a generator of this group if &quot;i&quot; is relatively prime to &quot;n&quot;, because these elements can generate all other elements of the group through integer addition.
(The number of such generators is &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), where &quot;φ&quot; is the Euler totient function.)
Every finite cyclic group &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to Z/&quot;n&quot;Z, where &quot;n&quot; = is the order of the group.

The addition operations on integers and modular integers, used to define the cyclic groups, are the addition operations of commutative rings, also denoted Z and Z/&quot;nZ or Z/(&quot;n&quot;). If &quot;p&quot; is a prime, then Z/&quot;pZ is a finite field, and is usually denoted F&quot;p&quot; or GF(&quot;p&quot;) for Galois field.

===Modular multiplication===

For every positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the set of the integers modulo &quot;n&quot; that are relatively prime to &quot;n&quot; is written as (Z/&quot;n&quot;Z)×; it forms a group under the operation of multiplication. This group is not always cyclic, but is so whenever &quot;n&quot; is 1, 2, 4, a power of an odd prime, or twice a power of an odd prime .
This is the multiplicative group of units of the ring Z/&quot;nZ; there are &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) of them, where again &quot;φ&quot; is the Euler totient function. For example, (Z/6Z)× = , and since 6 is twice an odd prime this is a cyclic group. In contrast, (Z/8Z)× = is a Klein 4-group and is not cyclic. When (Z/&quot;nZ)× is cyclic, its generators are called primitive roots modulo &quot;n&quot;.

For a prime number &quot;p&quot;, the group (Z/&quot;p&quot;Z)× is always cyclic, consisting of the non-zero elements of the finite field of order &quot;p&quot;. More generally, every finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of any field is cyclic.

===Rotational symmetries===

The set of rotational symmetries of a polygon forms a finite cyclic group. If there are &quot;n&quot; different ways of moving the polygon to itself by a rotation (including the null rotation) then this symmetry group is isomorphic to Z/&quot;n&quot;Z. In three or higher dimensions there exist other finite symmetry groups that are cyclic, but which are not all rotations around an axis, but instead rotoreflections.

The group of all rotations of a circle (the circle group, also denoted &quot;S&quot;1) is &quot;not&quot; cyclic, because there is no single rotation whose integer powers generate all rotations. In fact, the infinite cyclic group C∞ is countable, while &quot;S&quot;1 is not. The group of rotations by rational angles &quot;is&quot; countable, but still not cyclic.

===Galois theory===
An &quot;n&quot;th root of unity is a complex number whose &quot;n&quot;th power is 1, a root of the polynomial . The set of all &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity forms a cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot; under multiplication. The generators of this cyclic group are the &quot;n&quot;th primitive roots of unity; they are the roots of the &quot;n&quot;th cyclotomic polynomial.
For example, the polynomial factors as , where ; the set = forms a cyclic group under multiplication. The Galois group of the field extension of the rational numbers generated by the &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity forms a different group, isomorphic to the multiplicative group (Z/nZ)× of order &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), which is cyclic for some but not all &quot;n&quot; (see above).

A field extension is called a cyclic extension if its Galois group is cyclic. For fields of characteristic zero, such extensions are the subject of Kummer theory, and are intimately related to solvability by radicals. For an extension of finite fields of characteristic &quot;p&quot;, its Galois group is always finite and cyclic, generated by a power of the Frobenius mapping. Conversely, given a finite field &quot;F&quot; and a finite cyclic group &quot;G&quot;, there is a finite field extension of &quot;F&quot; whose Galois group is &quot;G&quot;.

==Subgroups==

All subgroups and quotient groups of cyclic groups are cyclic. Specifically, all subgroups of Z are of the form ⟨&quot;m&quot;⟩ = &quot;mZ, with &quot;m&quot; a positive integer. All of these subgroups are distinct from each other, and apart from the trivial group {0} = 0Z, they all are isomorphic to Z. The lattice of subgroups of Z is isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of natural numbers ordered by divisibility. Thus, since a prime number &quot;p&quot; has no nontrivial divisors, &quot;pZ is a maximal proper subgroup, and the quotient group Z/&quot;p&quot;Z is simple; in fact, a cyclic group is simple if and only if its order is prime.

All quotient groups Z/&quot;nZ are finite, with the exception For every positive divisor &quot;d&quot; of &quot;n&quot;, the quotient group Z/&quot;nZ has precisely one subgroup of order &quot;d&quot;, generated by the residue class of &quot;n&quot;/&quot;d&quot;. There are no other subgroups.

==Additional properties==
Every cyclic group is abelian. That is, its group operation is commutative: (for all &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot; in &quot;G&quot;). This is clear for the groups of integer and modular addition since , and it follows for all cyclic groups since they are all isomorphic to these standard groups. For a finite cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot;, &quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the identity element for any element &quot;g&quot;. This again follows by using the isomorphism to modular addition, since for every integer &quot;k&quot;. (This is also true for a general group of order &quot;n&quot;, due to Lagrange&#x27;s theorem.)

For a prime power formula_4, the group formula_5 is called a primary cyclic group. The fundamental theorem of abelian groups states that every finitely generated abelian group is a finite direct product of primary cyclic and infinite cyclic groups.

Because a cyclic group is abelian, each of its conjugacy classes consists of a single element. A cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot; therefore has &quot;n&quot; conjugacy classes.

If &quot;d&quot; is a divisor of &quot;n&quot;, then the number of elements in Z/&quot;n&quot;Z which have order &quot;d&quot; is &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;d&quot;), and the number of elements whose order divides &quot;d&quot; is exactly &quot;d&quot;.
If &quot;G&quot; is a finite group in which, for each , &quot;G&quot; contains at most &quot;n&quot; elements of order dividing &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; must be cyclic.
The order of an element &quot;m&quot; in Z/&quot;n&quot;Z is &quot;n&quot;/gcd(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;m&quot;).

If &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are coprime, then the direct product of two cyclic groups Z/&quot;nZ and Z/&quot;mZ is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z/&quot;nm&quot;Z, and the converse also holds: this is one form of the Chinese remainder theorem. For example, Z/12Z is isomorphic to the direct product under the isomorphism ; but it is not isomorphic to , in which every element has order at most 6.

If &quot;p&quot; is a prime number, then any group with &quot;p&quot; elements is isomorphic to the simple group Z/&quot;p&quot;Z.
A number &quot;n&quot; is called a cyclic number if Z/&quot;n&quot;Z is the only group of order &quot;n&quot;, which is true exactly when . The sequence of cyclic numbers include all primes, but some are composite such as 15. However, all cyclic numbers are odd except 2. The cyclic numbers are:

:1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 41, 43, 47, 51, 53, 59, 61, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 95, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 115, 119, 123, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 141, 143, ... 

The definition immediately implies that cyclic groups have group presentation and for finite &quot;n&quot;.

==Associated objects==

===Representations===
The representation theory of the cyclic group is a critical base case for the representation theory of more general finite groups. In the complex case, a representation of a cyclic group decomposes into a direct sum of linear characters, making the connection between character theory and representation theory transparent. In the positive characteristic case, the indecomposable representations of the cyclic group form a model and inductive basis for the representation theory of groups with cyclic Sylow subgroups and more generally the representation theory of blocks of cyclic defect.

===Cycle graph===
A cycle graph illustrates the various cycles of a group and is particularly useful in visualizing the structure of small finite groups. A cycle graph for a cyclic group is simply a circular graph, where the group order is equal to the number of nodes. A single generator defines the group as a directional path on the graph, and the inverse generator defines a backwards path. A trivial path (identity) can be drawn as a loop but is usually suppressed. Z2 is sometimes drawn with two curved edges as a multigraph.

A cyclic group Z&quot;n&quot;, with order &quot;n&quot;, corresponds to a single cycle graphed simply as an &quot;n&quot;-sided polygon with the elements at the vertices.
===Cayley graph===
A Cayley graph is a graph defined from a pair (&quot;G&quot;,&quot;S&quot;) where &quot;G&quot; is a group and &quot;S&quot; is a set of generators for the group; it has a vertex for each group element, and an edge for each product of an element with a generator. In the case of a finite cyclic group, with its single generator, the Cayley graph is a cycle graph, and for an infinite cyclic group with its generator the Cayley graph is a doubly infinite path graph. However, Cayley graphs can be defined from other sets of generators as well. The Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with arbitrary generator sets are called circulant graphs. These graphs may be represented geometrically as a set of equally spaced points on a circle or on a line, with each point connected to neighbors with the same set of distances as each other point. They are exactly the vertex-transitive graphs whose symmetry group includes a transitive cyclic group.

===Endomorphisms===
The endomorphism ring of the abelian group Z/&quot;nZ is isomorphic to Z/&quot;nZ itself as a ring. Under this isomorphism, the number &quot;r&quot; corresponds to the endomorphism of Z/&quot;nZ that maps each element to the sum of &quot;r&quot; copies of it. This is a bijection if and only if &quot;r&quot; is coprime with &quot;n&quot;, so the automorphism group of Z/&quot;nZ is isomorphic to the unit group (Z/&quot;n&quot;Z)×.

Similarly, the endomorphism ring of the additive group of Z is isomorphic to the ring Z. Its automorphism group is isomorphic to the group of units of the ring Z, which is .

===Tensor product and Hom of cyclic groups===
The tensor product can be shown to be isomorphic to . So we can form the collection of group homomorphisms from Z/&quot;mZ to Z/&quot;nZ, denoted , which is itself a group.

For the tensor product, this is a consequence of the general fact that , where &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring with unit and &quot;I&quot; and &quot;J&quot; are ideals of the ring. For the Hom group, recall that it is isomorphic to the subgroup of consisting of the elements of order dividing &quot;m&quot;. That subgroup is cyclic of order , which completes the proof.

==Related classes of groups==
Several other classes of groups have been defined by their relation to the cyclic groups:

===Virtually cyclic groups===
A group is called virtually cyclic if it contains a cyclic subgroup of finite index (the number of cosets that the subgroup has). In other words, any element in a virtually cyclic group can be arrived at by multiplying a member of the cyclic subgroup and a member of a certain finite set. Every cyclic group is virtually cyclic, as is every finite group. An infinite group is virtually cyclic if and only if it is finitely generated and has exactly two ends; an example of such a group is the direct product of Z/&quot;n&quot;Z and Z, in which the factor Z has finite index &quot;n&quot;. Every abelian subgroup of a Gromov hyperbolic group is virtually cyclic.

===Procyclic groups===

A profinite group is called procyclic if it can be topologically generated by a single element. Examples of profinite groups include the profinite integers formula_6 or the &quot;p&quot;-adic integers formula_7 for a prime number &quot;p&quot;.

===Locally cyclic groups===

A locally cyclic group is a group in which each finitely generated subgroup is cyclic. An example is the additive group of the rational numbers: every finite set of rational numbers is a set of integer multiples of a single unit fraction, the inverse of their lowest common denominator, and generates as a subgroup a cyclic group of integer multiples of this unit fraction. A group is locally cyclic if and only if its lattice of subgroups is a distributive lattice.

===Cyclically ordered groups===

A cyclically ordered group is a group together with a cyclic order preserved by the group structure. Every cyclic group can be given a structure as a cyclically ordered group, consistent with the ordering of the integers (or the integers modulo the order of the group).
Every finite subgroup of a cyclically ordered group is cyclic.

===Metacyclic and polycyclic groups===
A metacyclic group is a group containing a cyclic normal subgroup whose quotient is also cyclic. These groups include the cyclic groups, the dicyclic groups, and the direct products of two cyclic groups. The polycyclic groups generalize metacyclic groups by allowing more than one level of group extension. A group is polycyclic if it has a finite descending sequence of subgroups, each of which is normal in the previous subgroup with a cyclic quotient, ending in the trivial group. Every finitely generated abelian group or nilpotent group is polycyclic.

<text>A stock market, equity market, or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include &quot;securities&quot; listed on a public stock exchange as well as stock that is only traded privately, such as shares of private companies that are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Investments are usually made with an investment strategy in mind.

==Size of the market==
The total market capitalization of all publicly traded stocks worldwide rose from US$2.5 trillion in 1980 to US$111 trillion by the end of 2023.

, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world. Of these, there are 16 exchanges with a market capitalization of $1 trillion or more, and they account for 87% of global market capitalization. Apart from the Australian Securities Exchange, these 16 exchanges are all in North America, Europe, or Asia.

By country, the largest stock markets as of January 2022 are in the United States of America (about 59.9%), followed by Japan (about 6.2%) and United Kingdom (about 3.9%).

==Stock exchange==
A stock exchange is an exchange (or bourse) where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares (equity stock), bonds, and other securities. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. These and other stocks may also be traded &quot;over the counter&quot; (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.

Stock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed-interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives, which are more likely to be traded OTC.

Trade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. Equities (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.

Participants in the stock market range from small individual stock investors to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include banks, insurance companies, pension funds and hedge funds. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange trader.

Some exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as open outcry. This method is used in some stock exchanges and commodities exchanges, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the NASDAQ.

A potential buyer &quot;bids&quot; a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller &quot;asks&quot; a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling &quot;at the Market&quot; means you will accept &quot;any&quot; ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.

The purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a marketplace. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating price discovery.

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a hybrid market for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the trading floor. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a floor broker, who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated market maker (&quot;DMM&quot;) for that stock to trade the order. The DMM&#x27;s job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a bid–ask spread exists, no trade immediately takes place – in this case, the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the &quot;tape&quot; and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for program trading.

The NASDAQ is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ market makers will always provide a bid and ask the price at which they will always purchase or sell &#x27;their&#x27; stock.

The Paris Bourse, now part of Euronext, is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. Stockbrokers met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the CATS trading system was introduced, and the order matching system was fully automated.

People trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are Instinet, and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the commissions of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as adverse selection. Financial regulators have probed dark pools.

==Market participant==

Market participants include individual retail investors, institutional investors (e.g., pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, index funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, investor groups, banks and various other financial institutions), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares. Robo-advisors, which automate investment for individuals are also major participants.

=== Stock market participation post-2020 pandemic ===
In 2021, the value of world stock markets experienced an increase of 26.5%, amounting to US$22.3 trillion. Developing economies contributed US$9.9 trillion and developed economies US$12.4 trillion. Asia and Oceania accounted for 45%, Europe had 37%, and America had 16%, while Africa had 2% of the global market.

=== Stock market participation factors ===
Factors such as high trading prices, market ratings, information about stock exchange dynamics, and financial institutions can influence individual and corporate participation in stock markets. Additionally, the appeal of stock ownership, driven by the potential for higher returns compared to other financial instruments, plays a crucial role in attracting individuals to invest in the stock market.

Regional and country-specific factors can also impact stock market participation rates. For example, in the United States, stock market participation rates vary widely across states, with regional factors potentially influencing these disparities. It is noted that individual participation costs alone cannot explain such large differences in participation rates from state to state, indicating the presence of other regional factors at play.

Behavioral factors are recognized as significant influences on stock market participation, as evidenced by the low participation rates observed in the Ghanaian stock market.

Factors such as factor endowments, geography, political stability, liberal trade policies, foreign direct investment inflows, and domestic industrial capacity are also identified as important in determining participation.

=== Demographics of market participation ===
==== Indirect vs. Direct Investment ====
Indirect investment involves owning shares indirectly, such as via a mutual fund or an exchange traded fund. Direct investment involves direct ownership of shares.

Direct ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000. Indirect participation in the form of retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time. Rydqvist, Spizman, and Strebulaev attribute the differential growth in direct and indirect holdings to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way, the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.

==== Participation by income and wealth strata ====
Rates of participation and the value of holdings differ significantly across strata of income. In the bottom quintile of income, 5.5% of households directly own stock and 10.7% hold stocks indirectly in the form of retirement accounts. The top decile of income has a direct participation rate of 47.5% and an indirect participation rate in the form of retirement accounts of 89.6%. The median value of directly owned stock in the bottom quintile of income is $4,000 and is $78,600 in the top decile of income as of 2007. The median value of indirectly held stock in the form of retirement accounts for the same two groups in the same year is $6,300 and $214,800 respectively. Since the Great Recession of 2008 households in the bottom half of the income distribution have lessened their participation rate both directly and indirectly from 53.2% in 2007 to 48.8% in 2013, while over the same period households in the top decile of the income distribution slightly increased participation 91.7% to 92.1%. The mean value of direct and indirect holdings at the bottom half of the income distribution moved slightly downward from $53,800 in 2007 to $53,600 in 2013. In the top decile, mean value of all holdings fell from $982,000 to $969,300 in the same time. The mean value of all stock holdings across the entire income distribution is valued at $269,900 as of 2013.

====Participation by race and gender====
The racial composition of stock market ownership shows households headed by whites are nearly four and six times as likely to directly own stocks than households headed by blacks and Hispanics respectively. As of 2011 the national rate of direct participation was 19.6%, for white households the participation rate was 24.5%, for black households it was 6.4% and for Hispanic households it was 4.3%. Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female-headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.

====Determinants and possible explanations of stock market participation====
In a 2003 paper by Vissing-Jørgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing. Her research concludes that a fixed cost of $200 per year is sufficient to explain why nearly half of all U.S. households do not participate in the market. Participation rates have been shown to strongly correlate with education levels, promoting the hypothesis that information and transaction costs of market participation are better absorbed by more educated households. Behavioral economists Harrison Hong, Jeffrey Kubik and Jeremy Stein suggest that sociability and participation rates of communities have a statistically significant impact on an individual&#x27;s decision to participate in the market. Their research indicates that social individuals living in states with higher than average participation rates are 5% more likely to participate than individuals that do not share those characteristics. This phenomenon also explained in cost terms. Knowledge of market functioning diffuses through communities and consequently lowers transaction costs associated with investing.

==History==
In 12th-century France, the courtiers &quot;de change&quot; were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first brokers. The Italian historian Lodovico Guicciardini described how, in late 13th-century Bruges, commodity traders gathered outdoors at a market square containing an inn owned by a family called &quot;Van der Beurze&quot;, and in 1409 they became the &quot;Brugse Beurse&quot;, institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting. The idea quickly spread around Flanders and neighboring countries and &quot;Beurzen&quot; soon opened in Ghent and Rotterdam. International traders, and specially the Italian bankers, present in Bruges since the early 13th-century, took back the word in their countries to define the place for stock market exchange: first the Italians (Borsa), but soon also the French (Bourse), the Germans (börse), Russians (birža), Czechs (burza), Swedes (börs), Danes and Norwegians (børs). In most languages, the word coincides with that for money bag, dating back to the Latin bursa, from which obviously also derives the name of the Van der Beurse family.

In the middle of the 13th century, Venetian bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in Pisa, Verona, Genoa and Florence also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century. Around this time, a joint stock company—one whose stock is owned jointly by the shareholders—emerged and became important for the colonization of what Europeans called the &quot;New World&quot;.
There are now stock markets in virtually every developed and most developing economies, with the world&#x27;s largest markets being in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, India, China, Canada, Germany, France, South Korea and the Netherlands.

==Importance==
===Function and purpose===
The stock market is one of the most important ways for companies to raise money, along with debt markets which are generally more imposing but do not trade publicly. This allows businesses to be publicly traded, and raise additional financial capital for expansion by selling shares of ownership of the company in a public market. The liquidity that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as property and other immoveable assets.

History has shown that the price of stocks and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to be an up-and-coming economy. The stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country&#x27;s economic strength and development.

Rising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, central banks tend to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of financial system functions. Financial stability is the of central banks.

Exchanges also act as the clearinghouse for each transaction, meaning that they collect and deliver the shares, and guarantee payment to the seller of a security. This eliminates the risk to an individual buyer or seller that the counterparty could default on the transaction.

The smooth functioning of all these activities facilitates economic growth in that lower costs and enterprise risks promote the production of goods and services as well as possibly employment. In this way the financial system is assumed to contribute to increased prosperity, although some controversy exists as to whether the optimal financial system is bank-based or market-based.

Events such as the 2007–2008 financial crisis have prompted a heightened degree of scrutiny of the impact of the structure of stock markets (called market microstructure), in particular to the stability of the financial system and the transmission of systemic risk.

===Relation to the modern financial system===

A transformation is the move to electronic trading to replace human trading of listed securities.

===Behavior of stock prices===

Changes in stock prices are mostly caused by external factors such as socioeconomic conditions, inflation, exchange rates. Intellectual capital does not affect a company stock&#x27;s current earnings. Intellectual capital contributes to a stock&#x27;s return growth. 

The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information at the current time.

The &#x27;hard&#x27; efficient-market hypothesis does not explain the cause of events such as the crash in 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 22.6 percent—the largest-ever one-day fall in the United States.

This event demonstrated that share prices can fall dramatically even though no generally agreed upon definite cause has been found: a thorough search failed to detect &quot;any&quot; &#x27;reasonable&#x27; development that might have accounted for the crash. (Such events are predicted to occur strictly by randomness, although very rarely.) It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur &#x27;randomly&#x27;) are &quot;not&quot; occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.

A &#x27;soft&#x27; EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants cannot &quot;systematically&quot; profit from any momentary &#x27;market anomaly&#x27;. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e. non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and value at risk limits, &quot;theoretically could&quot; cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).

Other research has shown that psychological factors may result in &quot;exaggerated&quot; (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors &#x27;cancel out&#x27;). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to &#x27;seeing&#x27; patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just &quot;noise&quot;, e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context, this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors&#x27; self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.

Another phenomenon—also from psychology—that works against an objective assessment is &quot;group thinking&quot;. As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group. An example with which one may be familiar is the reluctance to enter a restaurant that is empty; people generally prefer to have their opinion validated by those of others in the group.

In one paper the authors draw an analogy with gambling. In normal times the market behaves like a game of roulette; the probabilities are known and largely independent of the investment decisions of the different players. In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.

Stock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively.

Economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends. Macroeconomic trends include such as changes in GDP, unemployment rates, national income, price indices, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, saving, investment, energy, international trade, immigration, productivity, aging populations, innovations, international finance. increasing corporate profit, increasing profit margins, higher concentration of business, lower company income, less vigorous activity, less progress, lower investment rates, lower productivity growth, less employee share of corporate revenues, decreasing Worker to Beneficiary ratio (year 1960 5:1, year 2009 3:1, year 2030 2.2:1), increasing female to male ratio college graduates.

=== Irrational behavior ===
Sometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself. However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counter reaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected. Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, euphoria and mass panic.

Over the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or bought by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.

Behaviorists argue that investors often behave &quot;irrationally&quot; when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money. However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.

===Crashes===

A stock market crash is often defined as a sharp dip in share prices of stocks listed on the stock exchanges. In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public&#x27;s loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative economic bubbles.

There have been famous stock market crashes that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the social security and retirement plans are being increasingly privatized and linked to stocks and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the stock market crash of 1973–4, the Black Monday of 1987, the Dot-com bubble of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.

=== 1929 ===
One of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the Great Depression.

=== 1987 ===
Another famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 – Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.

By the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history – the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names &quot;Black Monday&quot; and &quot;Black Tuesday&quot; are also used for October 28–29, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday—the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.

The crash in 1987 raised some puzzles – main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the theory of rational human conduct, the theory of market equilibrium and the efficient-market hypothesis. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the Federal Reserve System and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.

=== 2007-2009 ===
This marked the beginning of the Great Recession. Starting in 2007 and lasting through 2009, financial markets experienced one of the sharpest declines in decades. It was more widespread than just the stock market as well. The housing market, lending market, and even global trade experienced unimaginable decline. Sub-prime lending led to the housing bubble bursting and was made famous by movies like The Big Short where those holding large mortgages were unwittingly falling prey to lenders. This saw banks and major financial institutions completely fail in many cases and took major government intervention to remedy during the period. From October 2007 to March 2009, the S&amp;P 500 fell 57% and wouldn&#x27;t recover to its 2007 levels until April 2013.

=== 2020 ===
The 2020 stock market crash was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 and ended on 7 April. This market crash was due to the sudden outbreak of the global pandemic, COVID-19. The crash ended with a new deal that had a positive impact on the market.

=== Circuit breakers ===
Since the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic &#x27;matching engines&#x27; to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.

==Stock market index==
The movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the S&amp;P, the FTSE, the Euronext indices and the NIFTY &amp; SENSEX of India. Such indices are usually market capitalization weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.

==Derivative instruments==
Financial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stock index and stock options, equity swaps, single-stock futures, and stock index futures. These last two may be traded on futures exchanges (which are distinct from stock exchanges—their history traces back to commodity futures exchanges), or traded over-the-counter. As all of these products are only &quot;derived&quot; from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) derivatives market, rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.

==Leveraged strategies==
Stock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using short selling; margin buying may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, &quot;derivatives&quot; may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.

===Short selling===

In short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called &quot;covering&quot;. This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of naked shorting is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.

===Margin buying===

In margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks&#x27; value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).

A margin call is made if the total value of the investor&#x27;s account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account&#x27;s equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)

Regulation of margin requirements (by the Federal Reserve) was implemented after the Crash of 1929. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total investment represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of &quot;free-riding:&quot; putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).

==Types of financial markets==
Financial markets can be divided into different subtypes:

===For the assets transferred===
*Money market : It is traded with money or financial assets with short-term maturity and high liquidity, generally assets with a term of less than one year.
*Capital market : Financial assets with medium and long-term maturity are traded, which are basic for carrying out certain investment processes.

===Depending on its structure===
*Organized market
*Non-organized markets denominated in English (Over The Counter or OTC).

===According to the negotiation phase of financial assets===
*Primary market : Financial assets are created. In this market, assets are transmitted directly by their issuer.
*Secondary market : Only existing financial assets are exchanged, which were issued at a previous time. This market allows holders of financial assets to sell instruments that were already issued in the primary market (or that had already been transmitted in the secondary market) and that are in their possession, or to buy other financial assets.

===According to the geographical perspective===
*National markets. The currency in which the financial assets are denominated and the residence of those involved is national. 
*International markets. The situated outside a country&#x27;s geographical area.

===According to the type of asset traded===
*Traditional market. In which financial assets such as demand deposits, stocks or bonds are traded.
*Alternative market. In which alternative financial assets are traded such as portfolio investments, promissory notes, factoring, real estate (e.g. through fiduciary rights), in private equity funds, venture capital funds, hedge funds, investment projects (e.g. infrastructure, cinema, etc.) among many others.

===Other markets===
*Commodity markets, which allow the trading of commodities.
*Derivatives markets, which provide instruments for managing financial risk.
*Forward markets, which provide standardized forward contracts to trade products at a future date.
*Insurance markets, which allows the redistribution of varied risks.
*Foreign exchange market, which allows the exchange of foreign currencies.

=== Stock market and foreign exchange market ===
While the stock market is the marketplace for buying and selling company stocks, the foreign exchange market, also known as forex or FX, is the global marketplace for the purchase and sale of national currencies. It serves several functions, including facilitating currency conversions, managing foreign exchange risk through futures and forwards, and providing a platform for speculative investors to earn a profit on FX trading. The market includes various types of products, such as the spot market, futures market, forward market, swap market, and options market. For example, the spot market involves the immediate buying and selling of currencies, while the forward market allows for the buying and selling of currencies at an agreed exchange rate, with the actual exchange taking place at a future delivery date. The foreign exchange market is needed for facilitating global trade, including investments, the exchange of goods and services, and financial transactions, and it is considered one of the largest markets in the global economy.

=== Electronic trading market ===
The electronic trading market refers to the digital marketplace where financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and derivatives are bought and sold through online platforms. This market operates via electronic trading platforms, also known as online trading platforms, which are software applications that enable the trading of financial products over a network, typically through a financial intermediary. Platforms, such as eToro, Plus500, Robinhood, and AvaTrade serve as a digital medium for trading financial instruments and make financial markets more accessible, allowing individual investors to participate in trading without the need for traditional brokers or substantial capital. They also provide features such as real-time market data, stock price analysis, research reports, and news updates, which support decision-making in trading activities.

These platforms often incorporate systems, such as the Martingale Trading System, used in forex trading. Additionally, online trading has evolved to include mobile trading apps, enabling transactions to be conducted remotely via smartphones.

==Investment strategies==

Many strategies can be classified as either fundamental analysis or technical analysis. Fundamental analysis refers to analyzing companies by their financial statements found in SEC filings, business trends, and general economic conditions. Technical analysis studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company&#x27;s financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the Trend following method, used by John W. Henry and Ed Seykota, which uses price patterns and is also rooted in risk management and diversification.

Additionally, many choose to invest via passive index funds. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the S&amp;P 500 Index or Wilshire 5000). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.

Responsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of fundamental analysis only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. Socially responsible investing is another investment preference.

== Annual stock market growth ==
The average annual growth rate of the stock market, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 index, has historically been around 10%. This figure represents the long-term average return and is often cited as a benchmark for assessing the performance of the stock market as a whole.

The market&#x27;s results from one year to the next may vary substantially from the long-term average. For instance, in 2012–2021, the S&amp;P 500 index had an average annual return of 14.8%. However, individual annual returns can fluctuate widely, with some years experiencing negative growth and others seeing substantial gains.

While the average stock market return is around 10% per year, there is also the impact of inflation, resulting in investors&#x27; losing purchasing power of 2% to 3% every year due to it, which reduces the real rate of return on investments.

==Taxation==
Taxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a capital gains tax. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as &quot;double taxation&quot;.

==Stock market scams==
The Indian stock exchanges, Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India, have been rocked by several high-profile corruption scandals. At times, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred various individuals and entities from trading on the exchanges for stock manipulation, especially in illiquid small-cap and penny stocks.

<doc id="52329" wikidata="Q47944" url="?curid=52329" title="Allegany County, New York">
<text>Allegany County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 46,456. Its county seat is Belmont. Its name derives from a Lenape word, applied by European-American settlers of Western New York State to a trail that followed the Allegheny River; they also named the county after this. The county is part of the Western New York region of the state.

The county is bisected by the Genesee River, flowing north to its mouth on Lake Ontario. During the mid-nineteenth century, the Genesee Valley Canal was built to link southern markets to the Great Lakes and Mohawk River. The county was also served by railroads, which soon superseded the canals in their capacity for carrying freight. Part of the Oil Springs Reservation, controlled by the Seneca Nation, is located in the county.

==History==
For centuries, Allegany County was the territory of the Seneca people, at the westernmost nation of the Five Nations of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, a confederacy of Iroquoian languages-speaking peoples. European-American permanent settlement did not take place until after the American Revolutionary War and the forced cession by the Seneca of most of their lands in western New York. New York State sold off the lands cheaply to attract new European-American settlers and agricultural development.

Allegany County was created by the state legislature on April 7, 1806, when Genesee County, New York, was partitioned to set aside some to the new county. The first County Seat was established at Angelica, New York, where it remained for half a century. It was later moved to Belmont, a village located along the Genesee River. On March 11, 1808, the borders were adjusted so that of Steuben County passed to Allegany County, and of Allegany County passed to Genesee County. This established the current border between Genesee and Steuben counties, and reduced the size of Allegany County to . On June 12, 1812, the legislature authorized the attachment of Cattaraugus County, New York, to Allegany County for administration reasons, but for practical reasons this action did not take place at that time. However, on April 13, 1814, the eastern half of Cattaraugus County was so attached and administered from Belmont. This attachment was ended on March 28, 1817. With continued settlement through the mid-nineteenth century, the legislature periodically adjusted county borders as new counties were organized in western New York. On April 1, 1846, Allegany County lost to Wyoming County, reducing the size of Allegany County to , and establishing the current border between Allegany and Wyoming counties. On May 11, 1846, Allegany County lost to Livingston County, reducing the total to , and establishing the western portion of the current border with Livingston County. On March 23, 1857, Allegany County lost another to Livingston County, passing the Ossian, New York, area to Livingston County, and establishing the current border between them.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.5%) is water.

Allegany County is in the southwestern part of New York State, along the Pennsylvania border. Allegany County does not lie along the Allegheny River, as its name would suggest. The highest point in the county is Alma Hill, with an elevation of above sea level. This is the highest point in the state west of the Catskill Mountains. The highest point of Interstate 86 is located in the town of West Almond with an elevation of 2,110 feet. This is also believed to be the highest point of any interstate in the New York. The county is unique from a watershed perspective as it is providing water to three major watersheds of North America: The eastern part near Alfred has Canacadea Creek that goes into the Canisteo River, Susquehanna River and eventually to Chesapeake Bay.

The Genesee River bisects the county from south to north, flowing north out of the County through Letchworth State Park with its three waterfalls on to Rochester over three more waterfalls to its mouth on Lake Ontario and then on to the St. Lawrence River and Atlantic Ocean. The southwestern part of the County flows into the Allegheny River that flows into the Ohio and then to the Mississippi River basin to the Gulf of Mexico.

In June 1972 the remnants of Hurricane Agnes stalled over the area, dropping more than of rain. Flooding took place in the valley communities of Wellsville, Belmont, Belfast, and others in the county.

Long a necessary transportation waterway for the Seneca and other Native Americans, and successive European-American settlers, since the late 20th century, the Genesee River has been extremely popular with canoeists. The river is also favored by fishermen as it abounds in smallmouth bass, trout and panfish.

<doc id="52330" wikidata="Q2133060" url="?curid=52330" title="Robber baron (feudalism)">
<text>A robber baron or robber knight () was an unscrupulous feudal landowner who, protected by his fief&#x27;s legal status, imposed high taxes and tolls out of keeping with the norm without authorization by some higher authority. Some resorted to actual banditry. The German term for robber barons, &quot;Raubritter&quot; (robber knights), was coined by Friedrich Bottschalk in 1810.

Some robber barons violated the custom under which tolls were collected on the Rhine either by charging higher tolls than the standard or by operating without authority from the Holy Roman Emperor altogether. During the period in the history of the Holy Roman Empire known as the Great Interregnum (1250–1273), the number of such tolling stations exploded in the absence of Imperial authority.

Medieval robber barons most often imposed high or unauthorized tolls on rivers or roads passing through their territory. Some robbed merchants, land travelers, and river traffic—seizing money, cargoes, even entire ships—or engaged in kidnapping for ransom.

==Germany==

===Early development===
Tolls were collected from ships sailing on the River Rhine in Europe for one thousand years from around 800 AD to 1800 AD. During this time, various feudal lords (among them archbishops who held fiefs from the Holy Roman Emperor) collected tolls from passing cargo ships to bolster their finances. Only the Holy Roman Emperor could authorise the collection of such tolls. Allowing the nobility and Church to collect tolls from the busy traffic on the Rhine seems to have been an attractive alternative to other means of taxation and funding of government functions.

Iron chains were often stretched across the river to prevent passage without paying the toll, and strategic towers were built to facilitate this.

The Holy Roman Emperor and the various noblemen and archbishops who were authorised to levy tolls seem to have worked out an informal way of regulating this process. Among the decisions involved in managing the collection of tolls on the Rhine were how many toll stations to have, where they should be built, how high the tolls should be, and the advantages/disadvantages. While this decision process was made no less complex by being informal, common factors included the local power structure (archbishops and nobles being the most likely recipients of a charter to collect tolls), space between toll stations (authorized toll stations seem to have been at least five kilometres apart), and ability to be defended from attack (some castles through which tolls were collected were tactically useful until the French invaded in 1689 and levelled them). Tolls were standardized either in terms of an amount of silver coin allowed to be charged or an &quot;in-kind&quot; toll of cargo from the ship.

The men who came to be known as robber barons or robber knights () violated the structure under which tolls were collected on the Rhine either by charging higher tolls than the standard or by operating without authority from the Holy Roman Emperor altogether.

Writers of the period referred to these practices as &quot;unjust tolls,&quot; and not only did the robber barons thereby violate the prerogatives of the Holy Roman Emperor, they also went outside of the society&#x27;s behavioural norms, since merchants were bound both by law and religious custom to charge a &quot;just price&quot; for their wares.

===Great Interregnum===
During the period in the history of the Holy Roman Empire known as the Great Interregnum (1250–1273), when there was no Emperor, the number of tolling stations exploded in the absence of imperial authority. In addition, robber barons began to earn their &quot;&quot; by robbing ships of their cargoes, stealing entire ships, and even kidnapping.

In response to this organized, military lawlessness, the &quot;Rheinischer Bund,&quot; or Rhine League was formed by 100 Cities, and from several princes and prince-prelates (lords of the Church), all of whom held large stakes in the restoration of law and order to the Rhine.

Officially launched in 1254, the Rhine League wasted no time putting robber barons out of business by the simple expedient of taking and destroying their castles. In the next three years, four robber barons were targeted and between ten and twelve robber castles destroyed or inactivated.

The Rhine League was not only successful in suppressing illicit collection of tolls and river robbery, they also took action against other state aggression. For example, they are documented as having intervened to rescue a victim of abduction by the Baron of Rietberg.

The procedure pioneered by the Rhine League for dealing with robber barons – to besiege, capture and destroy their castles – survived long after the League self-destructed from political strife over the election of a new Emperor and military reversals against unusually strong robber barons.

When the Interregnum ended, the new king Rudolf of Habsburg applied the lessons learned by the Rhine League to the destruction of the highway robbers at Sooneck, torching their castles and hanging them. While robber barony never entirely ceased, especially during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the excesses of their heyday during the Interregnum never recurred.

==England==
The reign of King Stephen of England (1135–1154) was a long period of civil unrest commonly known as &quot;The Anarchy&quot;. In the absence of strong central kingship, the nobility of England were a law unto themselves, as characterised in this excerpt from the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;:

==Literature references==
Michael Heller refers to the original robber barons to illustrate his tragedy of the anticommons in his 2008 book. The tragedy of the anticommons is a type of coordination breakdown, in which a single resource has numerous rightsholders who prevent others from using it, frustrating what would be a socially desirable outcome.

In Ken Follett&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot;, taking place in England during The Anarchy, the main villain is a vicious and ruthless earl who behaves as described in the quote above.

<text>Broome County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 United States census, the county had a population of 198,683. Its county seat is Binghamton. The county was named for John Broome, the state&#x27;s lieutenant governor when Broome County was created. The county is part of the Southern Tier region of the state.

The county is part of the Binghamton, New York Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is home to Binghamton University, one of four university centers in the State University of New York (SUNY) system.

==History==
When counties were established in the Province of New York in 1683, the present Broome County was part of the enormous Albany County, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now is organized as 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.

In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County, for General Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, thus replacing the name of the hated British governor.

In 1789, Montgomery County was reduced in size by the splitting off of Ontario County. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne Counties.

In 1791, Tioga County split off from Montgomery County, along with Herkimer and Otsego Counties. Tioga County was at this time much larger than the present county and included the present Broome and Chemung Counties and parts of Chenango and Schuyler Counties.

In 1798, Tioga County was reduced in size by the splitting off of Chemung County (which also included part of the present Schuyler County) and by the combination of a portion with a portion of Herkimer County to create Chenango County.

On March 28, 1806, Broome County was formed by splitting several towns off from Tioga County. At the time, this included all of Broome County&#x27;s current area, as well as the then-named town of Tioga (renamed the town of Owego in 1813) and the town of Berkshire. Small portions of land were lost to Cortland County and Tompkins County in 1815 and 1817, respectively. The towns of Owego and Berkshire were returned to Tioga County on March 21, 1822, establishing the present-day boundaries of Broome County.

==Geography==

Broome County lies on the southern line of New York. Its southern border abuts the northern boundary of the state of Pennsylvania. The Susquehanna River flows southward through the eastern part of the county, enters Susquehanna County in Pennsylvania, then re-enters Broome and flows northwestward to meet the Chenango River at Binghamton. The combined flow moves west-southwestward into Tioga County to the west. The West Branch Delaware River flows southward along the lower portion of the county&#x27;s east border, delineating that portion of the border between Broome and Delaware counties.

The county&#x27;s western portion is hilly, with wide valleys that accommodate Binghamton and its suburbs. In the northern portion, Interstate 81 traverses a wide glacial valley. The eastern part of the county is much more rugged, as the land rises to the Catskill Mountains. The terrain generally slopes to the west. The county&#x27;s highest point is in the southeast of the county, a U.S. National Geodetic Survey benchmark known as Slawson atop an unnamed hill in the Town of Sanford. It is approximately above sea level. An area due east on the Delaware County line in Oquaga Creek State Park also lies within the same elevation contour line. The lowest point is above sea level, along the Susquehanna River, at the Pennsylvania state line.

The county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.4%) is water.

Cattaraugus County comprises the Olean, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Olean, NY Combined Statistical Area. Within its boundaries are the Allegany Indian Reservation of the Seneca Nation of New York, and the Allegany State Park. The Allegheny River runs through the county.

==History==

In ancient times, the largely unsettled territory was the traditional homeland of the now-extinct Wenrohronon Indians. It later became the territory of the Seneca people, one of the five Nations of the Haudenosaunee.

During the colonial era, it was claimed by at least three British colonies: New York Colony, Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the Province of Pennsylvania, each of which extended their colonial claims to the west until after the Revolutionary War.

When counties were established in the Province of New York in 1683, the territory of Cattaraugus County was included within Albany County. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York as well as all of the modern-day state of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. As additional areas were settled, the county was reduced on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady. The county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County is represented in the 21st century by 37 counties of New York. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.

In the years before 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled across the Niagara Frontier into modern day Ontario, Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the Revolutionary War (and a treaty with Massachusetts that finally settled who owned Western New York), the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County in honor of the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec. This replaced the name of the hated British governor.

In practice, however, these counties did not cover modern Cattaraugus County or Western New York. Most of that area lay within the Indian Reserve established in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix by the British; it was intended to be reserved for Native Americans and was ruled off-limits to European settlement.

The newly independent United States sought to extinguish Native reserves after the British ceded their territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes to the United States. This included Iroquois territory in New York; the four nations that had been allies of the British mostly relocated to Ontario, Canada where the Crown gave them land grants in some compensation for losses. The Treaty of Canandaigua, in 1794, extinguished what was left of native title, with the exception of several reservations, three of which were at least partially located in what is now Cattaraugus County.

Ontario County was split from Montgomery County in 1789 as a result of the establishment of the Morris Reserve. In turn, Genesee County was split from Ontario County in 1802 as a result of the Holland Purchase. This period was the beginning of more significant European-American settlement of this western territory. Shortly afterward, Genesee County was reduced in 1806 by the creation of Allegany County.

Cattaraugus County was formed in 1808, split off from Genesee County. At first there was no county government due to the sparse population. From 1812 to 1814, Cattaraugus County was incorporated in Allegany County; from 1814 to 1817, records of the county were divided between Belmont (Allegany County) and Buffalo (then in Niagara County).

The name &quot;Cattaraugus&quot; derives from a Seneca word for &quot;bad smelling banks,&quot; in reference to the odor of natural gas leaking from rock seams. In 1817, a county government was established for Cattaraugus County in the southwestern corner of the town of Hebe, now Ellicottville.

Numerous towns in the county are named after agents of the Holland Land Company, including Ellicottville (Joseph Ellicott), Franklinville (William Temple Franklin, a speculator and grandson of Benjamin Franklin), and Otto and East Otto (Jacob Otto).

The first settlement in the county was in Olean. After 1860, in response to the construction of a railroad (where the Pat McGee Trail is now), the county seat was moved to Little Valley.

The Allegany Indian Reservation is within the county boundaries and is one of two controlled by the federally recognized Seneca Nation of New York in the western part of the state; the Seneca&#x27;s other territories, Cattaraugus Reservation and Oil Springs Reservation, are both partially within county boundaries. South of Salamanca, New York, a small city located within the reservation, is Allegany State Park, which is contiguous with the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.1%) is water.

Cattaraugus County is in the southwestern part of the state, immediately north of the Pennsylvania border, bordering the counties of McKean County, Pennsylvania and Warren County, Pennsylvania. The southern part of Cattaraugus County is the only area of western New York that was not covered by the last ice age glaciation. It is noticeably more rugged than neighboring areas that had peaks rounded and valleys filled by the glacier. The entire area is a dissected plateau of Pennsylvanian and Mississippian age, but appears mountainous to the casual observer. It is this string of mountain-like peaks that gives the county its promotional name, the &quot;Enchanted Mountains&quot;.

The plateau is an extension of the Allegany Plateau from nearby Pennsylvania. Southern Cattaraugus County is part of the same oil field, and petroleum was formerly a resource of the area. It is now mostly played out, but natural gas continues to be extracted.

A continental divide between the Mississippi River and Great Lakes watersheds runs through Cattaraugus County.

The northern border of the county is formed by Cattaraugus Creek and the Allegheny River flows through the county.

==Government and politics==












|}

Cattaraugus County is run by a unicameral legislature who appoint a county &quot;administrator&quot;. This individual serves many executive duties of a county executive but has no legislative veto power and is not elected.

The legislators are elected independently by districts (while some also serve as mayors of the villages they represent, their status as mayors does not affect in any way their seats on the legislature and thus it is not a Board of Supervisors). The county uses a system of proportional representation in which each legislator&#x27;s vote is weighted to the number of persons in their district; each district can have between one and three legislators. This system was imposed in the 1960s in the wake of the one man, one vote federal court rulings of the era; before this, the county operated under a true board of supervisors model. There are currently 17 members of the legislature with 16 Republicans and 1 Democrat. Each legislator serves a four-year term, with a limit of three terms.

All but one of those serving on the county council are Republicans, and only two years in the entire history of the county legislature (1992 to 1994) have seen the Democrats in the majority. Howard VanRensselaer, Sr. of Randolph serves as chairman, and Andy Burr serves as vice-chairman. In 2023, the lone Democrat&#x27;s seat was redistricted out of existence, prompting the local Democratic Party to withdraw from all county legislature races that year in protest.

Cattaraugus County is entirely within the boundaries of the 148th New York State Assembly District (served currently by Joseph Giglio), the 57th New York State Senate District served currently by George Borrello, and the U.S. House of Representatives 23rd district represented by Nick Langworthy. In the last of these, Cattaraugus County&#x27;s votes proved pivotal in the 2008 elections: incumbent Republican Randy Kuhl, who had strongly carried the county in 2004 and 2006, lost Cattaraugus County to Democrat Eric Massa in the 2008 elections.

The county generally votes for Republicans in most statewide and national offices. For instance, in 2004 George W. Bush defeated John Kerry in Cattaraugus County by a 60–40 margin, although Bill Clinton won Cattaraugus County very narrowly in 1996. In 2006, the county narrowly chose Eliot Spitzer over John Faso by a margin of about 1 percent in the governor&#x27;s race, and Hillary Clinton defeated John Spencer in the county by a 10 percentage point margin. In all other positions up for office in 2006, Republicans won all congressional and state legislature representatives. In 2008, the county voted for the Republican presidential candidate, with John McCain defeating Barack Obama by a 55-44% margin. In 2010, Republican Carl Paladino carried Cattaraugus County over Democrat (and eventual winner) Andrew Cuomo 65% to 31%. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Chuck Schumer, both incumbent Democrats, carried the county by 51% to 46% and 54% to 43% margins, respectively. The county regularly has high turnout for presidential elections, with upwards of 70 percent of eligible voters typically voting in the county. Only three Democrats have carried the county since 1900, with Democrats winning in 1912, 1964, and 1996.

An emerging trend among Cattaraugus County&#x27;s villages has been consolidation with their surrounding towns. Limestone voters approved dissolution into the Town of Carrollton in September 2009; that took effect at the beginning of 2011. On March 18, 2010, three other villages (East Randolph, Randolph and Perrysburg) followed suit and approved dissolution into their surrounding towns (Town of Randolph for the first two, and Town of Perrysburg for the third); these three villages dissolved at the beginning of 2012.

==Additional facts==
Two geological formations, both called &quot;Rock City,&quot; have the appearance of a town laid out with streets. One is in Olean and the other is in Little Valley.

Olean is the largest city in the county and is the major center for business. Ski country runs through Cattaraugus County; two ski resorts, popular with Canadians, lie in the town of Ellicottville: Holiday Valley Resort and HoliMont; Cattaraugus County once had numerous ski resorts within its bounds, scattered throughout the county, before contracting into Ellicottville alone by 1980. In addition, several snowmobile trails cross the county, including the Pat McGee Trail, a flagship for the county&#x27;s trail system, and the North Country Trail.

Cattaraugus County is considered part of Appalachia, as well as Western New York, upstate New York, the Southern Tier, the Twin Tiers and the Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Olean Combined Statistical Area. As a result of being at a geographic crossroads, the people of Cattaraugus County speak a variety of accents, ranging from mild variants of Appalachian English to Inland Northern American English, with a handful of people speaking in the more loud and nasal Buffalo English.

The sales tax in Cattaraugus County is 8% (4% from New York, 4% from the county).

A large Amish community is located in the western part of the county; with an estimated 2,500 residents, they constitute slightly under 3% of the county&#x27;s population. A portion of this community maintains an exceptionally older order that eschews indoor plumbing, which, combined with a small number of Seneca who still live on traditional subsistence, gives the county a high rate of homes without indoor plumbing compared to nearby counties.

<text>Cayuga County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 76,248. Its county seat and largest city is Auburn. The county was named for the Cayuga people, one of the Native American tribes in the Iroquois Confederation. The county is part of the Central New York region of the state.

Cayuga County comprises the Auburn, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Syracuse-Auburn, NY Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
When counties were established in the Province of New York in 1683, the present Cayuga County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of the present state of New York and all of the present state of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.
In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada.

In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County in honor of the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of the hated British governor.

In 1789, Montgomery County was reduced in size by the splitting off of Ontario County. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne Counties.

Herkimer County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery County (the others being Otsego and Tioga Counties) in 1791.

Onondaga County was formed in 1794 by the splitting of Herkimer County.

Cayuga County was formed in 1799 by the splitting of Onondaga County. This county was, however, much larger than the present Cayuga County. It then included the present Seneca and Tompkins Counties.

In 1804, Seneca County was formed by the splitting of Cayuga County. Then in 1817, in turn, a portion of Seneca County was combined with a piece of the remainder of Cayuga County to form Tompkins County.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, this region attracted European immigrants who developed farms or took over existing ones, particularly from Italy and Poland.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (20%) is water.

Cayuga County is located in the west central part of the state, in the Finger Lakes region. Owasco Lake is in the center of the county, and Cayuga Lake forms part of the western boundary. Lake Ontario is on the northern border, and Skaneateles Lake and Cross Lake form part of the eastern border. Cayuga County has more waterfront land than any other county in the state not adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean.

==Government and politics==


















Cayuga County is considered a swing county in national elections. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore won Cayuga County with 50% of the vote to George W. Bush&#x27;s 44%. In 2004, however, incumbent President Bush defeated John Kerry by a narrow margin of only 0.58%, or 49.22% to 48.64%. In 2008, it was won by Democrat Barack Obama, with 53% of the vote to Republican John McCain&#x27;s 45%. In 2012, Obama won the county again by a slightly larger margin over Republican Mitt Romney.

However, like most of upstate New York, Cayuga County swung right in 2016. Republican Donald Trump carried it with 52.41% of the vote to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 40.76%, the largest Republican vote share since 1988 and the largest margin of victory for a Republican since 1984. In 2020, Trump carried the county again, this time taking 53.49% of the vote (the largest vote share for any Republican since 1984) to Joe Biden&#x27;s 44.27%. Biden became the first Democrat to win the presidency without carrying Cayuga County since Jimmy Carter in 1976.

In statewide elections it has gone for Democrats: both Eliot Spitzer and Hillary Clinton won it in 2006 with more than 60% of the vote. In 2010, Democrat Andrew Cuomo defeated Republican Carl Paladino 53% to 40% for the governorship, with 3% going to Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins. Also in 2010, both Democratic U.S. Senators, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer, carried Cayuga County. Gillibrand won 54% of the vote, while Schumer won 61%.

The Cayuga County Legislature consists of 15 members, each of whom are elected from single-member districts.

<text>Chautauqua County is the westernmost county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 127,657. Its county seat is Mayville, and its largest city is Jamestown. Its name is believed to be the lone surviving remnant of the Erie language, a tongue lost in the 17th century Beaver Wars; its meaning is unknown and a subject of speculation. The county was created in 1808 and organized in 1811. The county is part of the Western New York region of the state.

Chautauqua County comprises the Jamestown–Dunkirk–Fredonia, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is located south east of Lake Erie and includes a small portion of the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca.

==History==
Prior to European colonization, most of what is now Chautauqua County was inhabited by the indigenous Erie people prior to the Beaver Wars in the 1650s. French forces traversed the territory beginning in 1615. The Seneca Nation conquered the territory during the Beaver Wars and held it through the next century until siding with the British crown, their allies for most of the 18th century, against the American revolutionaries in the American Revolutionary War.

Chautauqua County was organized by the state legislature during the development of western New York after the American Revolutionary War and the ratification of The Treaty of Canandaigua, between the United States and the Council of the Six Nations. It was officially separated from Genesee County on March 11, 1808. This partition was performed under the same terms that produced Cattaraugus and Niagara counties. The partition was done for political purposes, but the counties were not properly organized for self-government, so they were all administered as part of Niagara County.

On February 9, 1811, Chautauqua was completely organized, and its separate government was launched. This established Chautauqua as a county of of land. Chautauqua has not been altered since.

The first New York Chautauqua Assembly was organized in 1874 by Methodist minister John Heyl Vincent and businessman Lewis Miller in the county at a campsite on the shores of Chautauqua Lake.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (29%) is water.

Chautauqua County, in the southwestern corner of New York State, along the New York-Pennsylvania border, is the westernmost of New York&#x27;s counties. Chautauqua Lake is located in the center of the county, and Lake Erie is its northern border.

Part of the Eastern Continental Divide runs through Chautauqua County. The area that drains into the Conewango Creek (including Chautauqua Lake) eventually empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the rest of the county&#x27;s watershed empties into Lake Erie and via Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence Seaway into the North Atlantic Ocean. This divide, known as the Chautauqua Ridge, can be used to mark the border between the Southern Tier and the Niagara Frontier. It is also a significant dividing point in the county&#x27;s geopolitics, with the &quot;North County&quot; being centered on Dunkirk and the &quot;South County&quot; centered on Jamestown each having their own interests.

The county is generally composed of rolling hills and valleys, with elevations ranging anywhere between 1100 and 2100 feet, although the land within a few miles of Lake Erie is generally flat and at an elevation of 1000 feet or lower. The lowest point in the county is Lake Erie, at , and the highest point is Gurnsey Benchmark at .

==Government and politics==
All of the county is in the 150th New York State Assembly district, represented by Andy Goodell, and the New York State Senate 57th district represented by George Borrello. The entire county is within the bounds of New York&#x27;s 23rd congressional district which is represented by Nick Langworthy. 

The 2012 redistricting process moved all of Chautauqua County into Goodell&#x27;s assembly district, while the county also rejoined the former 31st (renumbered again as the 23rd) congressional district along with Cattaraugus and Allegany Counties. Prior to 2013, the county was part of New York&#x27;s 27th congressional district. Prior to 2003, the county was part of New York&#x27;s 31st congressional district, but it was controversially redistricted out of that district and into what was the 27th, and was replaced in the 29th district (the old 31st) by Rochester suburbs that had never before been part of the district. Chautauqua County, at the same time, joined southern Erie County and portions of the City of Buffalo in the 27th, areas that had also never been in the same district with each other. In both cases, the suburban additions had significantly more Democratic populations than before, leading to Democrats winning both districts, which led to accusations of cracking-based gerrymandering. 

Though the Republican Party has historically been dominant in Chautauqua County politics, the county had been a perfect bellwether county from 1980 to 2008, correctly voting for the winner of each presidential election in all eight elections during that time. However, in 2012, it voted for Republican Mitt Romney even as Democrat Barack Obama won re-election, marking its first miss since 1976. In 2016 the county reverted back to being solidly Republican, as Donald Trump won the county by the largest margin since Ronald Reagan in 1984.














Chautauqua County is one of nineteen “charter counties” in New York, which grants the county greater leeway in conducting its own affairs. A board of supervisors governed Chautauqua County until 1975, when a new county charter went into effect with provisions for a county executive and a 13-seat county legislature. The county council currently consists of 19 members each elected from single-member districts. As of 2024, there are 14 Republicans and 5 Democrats.

===New York State Assembly===
Prior to changes in representation of the New York State Assembly, each county had a given number of representatives. The following were representatives of Chautauqua County.

==Education==
Jamestown Community College has two campuses in the county at Jamestown and Dunkirk. The State University of New York at Fredonia is located in the northern part of the county. Jamestown Business College offered two year degrees, certificates, and a four-year degree in Jamestown, prior to its decision to cease new enrollments in 2024.

<doc id="52335" wikidata="Q257716" url="?curid=52335" title="Idiolect">
<text>Idiolect is an individual&#x27;s unique use of language, including speech. This unique usage encompasses vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. This differs from a dialect, a common set of linguistic characteristics shared among a group of people.

The term is etymologically related to the Greek prefix &quot;idio-&quot; (meaning &quot;own, personal, private, peculiar, separate, distinct&quot;) and &quot;-lect&quot;, abstracted from &quot;dialect&quot;, and ultimately from Ancient Greek .

Language consists of sentence constructs, word choices, and expressions of style, and an idiolect comprises an individual&#x27;s uses of these facets. Every person has a unique idiolect influenced by their language, socioeconomic status, and geographical location. Forensic linguistics psychologically analyzes idiolects.

The notion of &quot;language&quot; is used as an abstract description of the &quot;language use&quot;, and of the abilities of individual speakers and listeners. According to this view, a language is an &quot;ensemble of idiolects... rather than an entity per se&quot;. Linguists study particular languages by examining the utterances produced by native speakers.

This contrasts with a view among non-linguists, at least in the United States, that languages as ideal systems exist outside the actual practice of language users. Based on work done in the US, Nancy Niedzielski and Dennis Preston describe a language ideology seemingly common among American English speakers. According to Niedzielski and Preston, many of their subjects believe that there is one &quot;correct&quot; pattern of grammar and vocabulary that underlies Standard English, and that individual usage comes from this external system.

Linguists who understand particular languages as a composite of unique, individual idiolects must nonetheless account for the fact that members of large speech communities, and even speakers of different dialects of the same language, can understand one another. All human beings seem to produce language in essentially the same way. This has led to searches for universal grammar, as well as attempts to further define the nature of particular languages.

==Forensic linguistics==

Forensic linguistics includes attempts to identify whether a person produced a given text by comparing the style of the text with the idiolect of the individual in question. The forensic linguist may conclude that the text is consistent with the individual, rule out the individual as the author, or deem the comparison inconclusive.

In 1995, Max Appedole relied in part on an analysis of Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente&#x27;s writing style to identify him as Subcomandante Marcos, a leader of the Zapatista movement. Although the Mexican government regarded Subcomandante Marcos as a dangerous guerrilla, Appedole convinced the government that Guillén was a pacifist. Appedole&#x27;s analysis is considered an early success in the application of forensic linguistics to criminal profiling in law enforcement.

In 1998, Ted Kaczynski was identified as the &quot;Unabomber&quot; by means of forensic linguistics. The FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno pushed for the publication of an essay of Kaczynski&#x27;s, which led to a tip-off from Kaczynski&#x27;s brother, who recognized the writing style, his idiolect.

In 1978, four men were convicted of murdering Carl Bridgewater. No forensic linguistics was involved in their case at the time. Today, forensic linguistics reflects that the idiolect used in the interview of one of the men was very similar to that man&#x27;s reported statement. Since idiolects are unique to an individual, forensic linguistics reflects that it is very unlikely that one of these files was not created by using the other.

== Detecting idiolect with corpora ==
Idiolect analysis is different for an individual depending on whether the data being analyzed is from a corpus made up entirely from texts or audio files, since written work is more thought out in planning and precise in wording than in spontaneous speech, which is full of informal language and conversation fillers, e.g. &quot;umm...&quot; and &quot;you know&quot;. Corpora with large amounts of input data allow for the generation of word frequency and synonym lists, normally through the use of the top ten bigrams created from it. In such a situation, the context of word usage is considered, particularly when determining the legitimacy of a given bigram.

Whether a word or phrase is part of an idiolect is determined by the word&#x27;s location compared with the window&#x27;s &quot;head word&quot;, the edge of the window. This window is kept to 7-10 words, with a sample that is being considered as a feature of the idiolect being possibly +5/-5 words away from the &quot;head&quot; word of the window (which is normally in the middle). Data in corpus pertaining to idiolect get sorted into three categories: irrelevant, personal discourse marker(s), and informal vocabulary. Samples at the end of the frame and far from this head word are often deemed superfluous. Superfluous and non-superfluous data are then run through different functions to see if given words or phrases are a part of an individual&#x27;s idiolect.

<text>Aitutaki, also traditionally known as Araura and Utataki, is the second most-populated island in the Cook Islands, after Rarotonga. It is an &quot;almost atoll&quot;, with fifteen islets in a lagoon adjacent to the main island. Total land area is , and the lagoon has an area of between . A major tourist destination, Aitutaki is the second most visited island of the Cook Islands archipelago.

Aitutaki had a population of 1,712 in 2016. The main village is Arutanga (Arutunga) on the west side.

==Geography==

Aitutaki is sometimes described as an &quot;almost atoll&quot;, for it consists of a lagoon within an encircling atoll, with a significant area of high land on one side. It has a maximum elevation of approximately with the hill known as Maunga Pu close to its northernmost point. The land area of the atoll is , of which the main island occupies . The Ootu Peninsula, protruding east from the main island in a southerly direction along the eastern rim of the reef, takes up out of the main island. For the lagoon, area figures between are found. Satellite image measurement suggests that the larger figure also includes the reef flat, which is commonly not considered part of a lagoon.

The barrier reef that forms the basis of Aitutaki is roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle with sides in length. The southern edge of the triangle is almost totally below the surface of the ocean, and the eastern side is composed of a string of small islands including Mangere, Akaiami, and Tekopua.

The western side of the atoll contains many of Aitutaki&#x27;s important features including a boat passage through the barrier reef allowing for anchorage close to shore at Arutanga. Towards the south of the side is a small break in the barrier reef, allowing access for small boats to the lagoon which covers most of the southern part of the triangle. Further to the north is the bulk of the main island. Its fertile volcanic soil provides tropical fruits and vegetables. Two of Aitutaki&#x27;s 15 islets (motus) are also volcanic. The rest are made of coral.

Aitutaki Airport is located close to the triangle&#x27;s northern point. The southeastern part of the lagoon near Akaiami used to be used as a landing area for TEAL flying boats on the &quot;coral route&quot;.

==History==

Polynesians first settled Aitutaki around AD 1225–1430. They maintained voyaging contact over a wide area, for the geochemical source of basalt adze heads found in this island can be traced back to quarries on Samoa to the west and the Society Islands to the east. According to oral tradition, the island was named by Te Erui, who raised it from the ocean after traveling from Avaiki. Other traditions identify various settlers, including Ru, Te Munakorero, Kai, Ui-tario, and Ruatapu.

The first known European contact was with Captain Bligh and the crew of when they also arrived in Aitutaki on 11 April 1789, prior to the infamous mutiny.

Aitutaki was the first of the Cook Islands to practice Christianity, after London Missionary Society (LMS) missionary John Williams visited in 1821. The oldest church in the country, the Cook Islands Christian Church in Arutanga, was built by Papeiha (Bora Bora) and Vahapata (Raiatea), two LMS teachers Williams had left behind.
On 8–9 October 1900 seven instruments of cession of Rarotonga and other islands were signed by their chiefs and people; and by a British Proclamation issued at the same time the cessions were accepted, the islands being declared parts of Her Britannic Majesty&#x27;s dominions. Uniquely, these instruments did not include Aitutaki. It appears that, though the inhabitants of Aitutaki regarded themselves as British subjects, the Crown&#x27;s title was uncertain, and the island was formally annexed by Proclamation dated 9 October 1900. It was the only island in the Cook Islands that was annexed rather than ceded.

In 1942 New Zealand and American forces were stationed on the island. The American engineering firm Sverdrup &amp; Parcel, the New Zealand Ministry of Works, US military personnel and many locals combined to build two airstrips which were completed on 14 November 1942. This airport, and one on the northernmost Penrhyn Island, were to be used as bases by the Allies during World War II. The first aircraft, an American light bomber, landed on 22 November 1942. When the war ended some of the servicemen remained and married the locals.

During the 1950s Aitutaki&#x27;s lagoon was used as a stopover for TEAL (Tasman Empire Airways Limited) flying boats on the famous Coral Route. The islet of Akaiami was used as a resting stop for passengers, who often lay about until the aircraft was refueled for two hours. These operations ceased in 1960, and the only reminder are the remains of the purpose-built jetty on Akaiami. The flying boat &quot;Aranui&quot;, which was part of this service, is now on display at the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland, New Zealand.

Commercial banana-growing was introduced to the island in the late 1960s, but suffered a rapid decline due to wind damage, low prices, and inadequate shipping. The industry was revived in the late 1970s, but collapsed after New Zealand adopted Rogernomics and removed privileged market access. A tourism boom began in the early 1990s, with tourist numbers doubling to 10,000 visitors a year in 1994.

On 10–11 February 2010, Aitutaki was hit by Cyclone Pat. The high winds of the storm ripped the roofs off of most houses and damaged other buildings including a school and a hospital. At least 60% of houses were damaged. There were no reported deaths but a few minor injuries were reported. An Air Force Hercules cargo plane and an army engineering team were provided by New Zealand along with an initial $200,000. Cook Island MP Teina Bishop said &quot;New Zealand aid should have been sent to the devastated area much sooner&quot;.

In June 2010 the island was nominated &quot;the world&#x27;s most beautiful island&quot; by Tony Wheeler the founder of Lonely Planet travel guide.

The delegates of the 2012 Pacific Islands Forum, which had its main venue in Rarotonga, travelled to One Foot Island for a 2-day retreat.

==Demographics and settlement==

The population of Aitutaki was 1,941 in 2016.


Aitutaki is subdivided in 8 districts. The districts are further subdivided into 19 tapere (land holdings by tribe lineages).

The eight districts are:
#Amuri (Te Upoko Enua)
#Ureia (Uriuri A Punga)
#Arutanga (Rutanga O Te Toa)
#Reureu (Te Mata O Teerui)
#Nikaupara (Te Maru O Toi)
#Vaipae (Te Vaipaepae O Pau)
#Tautu (Titi Ai Tonga)
#Vaipeka (Te Arekarioi)

The eight districts are subdivided into 19 tapere as follows:
*Amuri District
**Amuri Tapere
**Punganui Tapere
*Anaunga District

==Culture==
===Sport===
The most popular sport on Aitutaki is Rugby union and netball, followed closely by volleyball. With a population of 2,000 residing on the island and 50,000 overseas, there are four clubs on Aitutaki and eight teams (each club having a first team and a reserve team). The best players on the island play for the Aitutaki island team against their main rivals Rarotonga.

===Education===
Araura College is the only secondary school on Aitutaki. The school has the role of teaching approximately 200 students from Year 7 (Form 1) to Year 13 (Form 7).

The island has two government schools and one church school: Araura Primary school, Vaitau Primary School and Tekaaroa Primary School. Tekaaroa Primary School is a private special character school which is the designated Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) school. Araura Primary is the larger of the primary schools, catering for the mostly populated part of the island and Vaitau Primary caters mostly for the Vaipae and Tautu villages. Tekaaroa Primary School caters for the Seventh Day Adventist children on the island.

==Economy==
Aitutaki is the second largest tourist destination in the Cook Islands, after Rarotonga, receiving 38,777 visitors in 2018. As a result, tourism dominates the economy, with 36% of the labour force employed in the restaurant and accommodation sector. The government is the next largest employer, employing 21%, with retail and wholesale employing 18% and agriculture, forestry and fishing 6%.

Aitutaki is connected to the rest of the Cook Islands by Aitutaki Airport and a port at Arutanga. In September 2020 Aitutaki was connected to the Manatua One Polynesia Fibre Cable, becoming one of the smallest fibre-connected islands in the world.

Since 2000 Aitutaki has served as a filming location for a variety of TV shows, including &quot;Shipwrecked&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Survivorman&quot;.

In 2019 a 750 kW solar array was installed as part of a plan to transition the island to 100% renewable energy.

==Ecology==
===Flora===
The flora of Aitutaki is highly modified, and on the main island only a few patches of degraded native forest survive near the airstrip. The main island&#x27;s ecology can be divided into four zones. The coastal flat is dominated by &quot;Guettarda speciosa&quot;, coconuts, Hibiscus, Pandanus, and &quot;Hernandia moerenhoutiana&quot;. The slopes are mostly &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot; interspersed with taro patches. The inland plateau is extensively cultivated, with plantations of coconuts, banana, citrus, and other food plants, as well as assorted introduced decorative shrubs. The high ground on the island was cleared during World War 2 for military installations and now consists of grasses and weedy species. The &quot;motu&quot; have &quot;Pemphis acidula&quot; scrub on the seaward side, phasing to &quot;Suriana&quot; scrub and coconut forest, with the volcanic islands containing forests of &quot;Calophyllum inophyllum&quot; which are not found on the other &quot;motu&quot;.

===Fauna===
Aitutaki is home to numerous species of sea- and shorebirds, including the red-tailed tropicbird, white-tailed tropicbird, brown booby, great frigatebird, brown noddy, black noddy, white tern, and Pacific reef heron. Land birds include the common myna and the blue lorikeet. The latter were badly affected by Cyclone Pat, losing over 50% of their population and virtually all juveniles. Subfossil remains show that Kuhl&#x27;s lorikeet, the spotless crake, and an undescribed species of whistling duck were all at one stage extant on Aitutaki before being extirpated. The main island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a population of blue lorikeets.

==Minor islands of Aitutaki==

The main island of Aitutaki occupies the northern part of the atoll, which is roughly triangular in shape. The minor islands form part of the perimeter of the lagoon. All islands, including the main island and its peninsula Ootu, are listed starting clockwise from the northernmost point of the atoll:

Tapuaetai (One Foot Island), a small islet in the south-east of the lagoon, is often said to be the most important attraction. It is regarded as providing the visitor with the best views of the Aitutaki lagoon and, depending on the tide, one is able to walk on a sandbank a decent distance away from Tapuaetai. The trip to this island is the most frequented trip available on Aitutaki. One Foot Island was awarded &quot;Australasia&#x27;s Leading Beach&quot; at the World Travel Awards held in Sydney in June 2008.

Ootu Peninsula is of coral formation, but attached to the main volcanic island, thus a peninsula. If it were an island, it would be the largest of the minor islands. Ootu Peninsula does belong to tapere and district of &quot;Vaitupa&quot;. The minor islands are not allocated to any districts or tapere, but they do form part of the larger constituencies.

All minor islets, except Akitua and Maina, are part of Vaipae–Tautu Constituency. Akitua is part of Amuri–Ureia Constituency, as is Ootu Peninsula, just north of Akitua. Maina is part of Arutanga–Reureu–Nikaupara Constituency. The main island is equally divided among the three constituencies Arutanga-Reureu-Nikaupara (southwest), Vaipae-Tautu (southeast), and Amuri-Ureia (north).

<text>The Brahmic scripts, also known as Indic scripts, are a family of abugida writing systems. They are used throughout the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and parts of East Asia. They are descended from the Brahmi script of ancient India and are used by various languages in several language families in South, East and Southeast Asia: Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, Mongolic, Austroasiatic, Austronesian, and Tai. They were also the source of the dictionary order (&quot;gojūon&quot;) of Japanese &quot;kana&quot;.

== History ==
Brahmic scripts descended from the Brahmi script. Brahmi is clearly attested from the 3rd century BCE during the reign of Ashoka, who used the script for imperial edicts. Northern Brahmi gave rise to the Gupta script during the Gupta period, which in turn diversified into a number of cursives during the medieval period. Notable examples of such medieval scripts, developed by the 7th or 8th century, include Nagari, Siddham and Sharada.

The Siddhaṃ script was especially important in Buddhism, as many sutras were written in it. The art of Siddham calligraphy survives today in Japan. The tabular presentation and dictionary order of the modern &quot;kana&quot; system of Japanese writing is believed to be descended from the Indic scripts, most likely through the spread of Buddhism.

Southern Brahmi evolved into the Kadamba, Pallava and Vatteluttu scripts, which in turn diversified into other scripts of South India and Southeast Asia. Brahmic scripts spread in a peaceful manner, Indianization, or the spread of Indian learning. The scripts spread naturally to Southeast Asia, at ports on trading routes. At these trading posts, ancient inscriptions have been found in Sanskrit, using scripts that originated in India. At first, inscriptions were made in Indian languages, but later the scripts were used to write the local Southeast Asian languages. Hereafter, local varieties of the scripts were developed. By the 8th century, the scripts had diverged and separated into regional scripts.

==Characteristics==

Some characteristics, which are present in most but not all the scripts, are:
* Each consonant has an inherent vowel which is usually a short ‘ə’ (in Bengali, Assamese and Odia, the phoneme is /ɔ/ due to sound shifts). Other vowels are written by adding to the character. A mark, known in Sanskrit as a virama/halanta/hasanta, can be used to indicate the absence of an inherent vowel, although it is rarely used.
* Each vowel has two forms, an independent form when not attached to a consonant, and a dependent form, when attached to a consonant. Depending on the script, the dependent forms can be either placed to the left of, to the right of, above, below, or on both the left and the right sides of the base consonant.
* Consonants (up to 4 in Devanagari) can be combined in ligatures. Special marks are added to denote the combination of &#x27;r&#x27; with another consonant.
* Nasalization and aspiration of a consonant&#x27;s dependent vowel is also noted by separate signs.
* The alphabetical order is: vowels, velar consonants, palatal consonants, retroflex consonants, dental consonants, bilabial consonants, approximants, sibilants, and other consonants. Each consonant grouping had four stops (with all four possible values of voicing and aspiration), and a nasal consonant.

== Comparison ==
Below are comparison charts of several of the major Indic scripts, organised on the principle that glyphs in the same column all derive from the same Brahmi glyph. Accordingly:
* The charts are not comprehensive. Glyphs may be unrepresented if they are later inventions not derived from any Brahmi character.
* The pronunciations of glyphs in the same column may not be identical. The pronunciation row is only representative; the (IPA) pronunciation is given for Sanskrit where possible, or another language if necessary.
The transliteration is indicated in ISO 15919.

=== Consonants ===

;Notes
=== Vowels ===
Vowels are presented in their independent form on the left of each column, and in their corresponding dependent form (vowel sign) combined with the consonant &quot;k&quot; on the right. A glyph for &quot;ka&quot; is an independent consonant letter itself without any vowel sign, where the vowel &quot;a&quot; is inherent.

==List of Brahmic scripts==

===Historical===
The Brahmi script was already divided into regional variants at the time of the earliest surviving epigraphy around the 3rd century BC. Cursives of the Brahmi script began to diversify further from around the 5th century AD and continued to give rise to new scripts throughout the Middle Ages. The main division in antiquity was between northern and southern Brahmi. In the northern group, the Gupta script was very influential, and in the southern group the Vatteluttu and Kadamba/Pallava scripts with the spread of Buddhism sent Brahmic scripts throughout Southeast Asia.

<doc id="52346" wikidata="Q12591" url="?curid=52346" title="Nebuchadnezzar II">
<text>Nebuchadnezzar II, also Nebuchadrezzar II, meaning &quot;Nabu, watch over my heir&quot;, was the second king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, ruling from the death of his father Nabopolassar in 605 BC to his own death in 562 BC. Often titled Nebuchadnezzar the Great, he is regarded as the empire&#x27;s greatest king, famous for his military campaigns in the Levant and their role in Jewish history, and for his construction projects in his capital of Babylon, including the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Ruling for 43 years, Nebuchadnezzar was the longest-reigning king of the Babylonian dynasty. By the time of his death, he was among the most powerful rulers in the world.

Possibly named after his grandfather of the same name, or after Nebuchadnezzar I ( 1125–1104 BC), one of Babylon&#x27;s greatest ancient warrior-kings, Nebuchadnezzar II had already secured renown for himself during his father&#x27;s reign, leading armies in the Medo-Babylonian conquest of the Assyrian Empire. At the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar inflicted a crushing defeat on an Egyptian army led by Pharaoh Necho II, and ensured that the Neo-Babylonian Empire would succeed the Neo-Assyrian Empire as the dominant power in the ancient Near East. Shortly after this victory, Nabopolassar died and Nebuchadnezzar became king.

Despite his successful military career during his father&#x27;s reign, Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s early reign saw few achievements, and witnessed a disastrous failed invasion of Egypt. This performance led some of Babylon&#x27;s vassals to doubt Babylon&#x27;s power and was the cause of brewing rebellion across his empire. After first putting down some insurrections in the east, Nebuchadnezzar turned his attention to the Levant and in the 580s BC engaged in a string of campaigns against his rebellious vassal states. In 587 BC, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem and destroyed it and the Kingdom of Judah, deporting much of its population in what became known as the Babylonian captivity. This episode earned Nebuchadnezzar a position of notoriety in Jewish history. Through this conquest, the subsequent capture of the Phoenician city of Tyre, and other campaigns in the Levant, Nebuchadnezzar restored the Neo-Babylonian Empire&#x27;s fortunes in the ancient Near East.

Beyond his military campaigns, Nebuchadnezzar is remembered as a great builder who erected many of Babylon&#x27;s religious buildings, including the Esagila and Etemenanki, embellished its palaces and beautified its ceremonial centre through renovations to the city&#x27;s processional street and the Ishtar Gate. He is also accredited with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. As most of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s inscriptions deal with his building projects rather than military accomplishments, he was for a time seen by historians mostly as a builder rather than a warrior.

== Sources ==
There are very few cuneiform sources for the period between 594 BC and 557 BC, which covers much of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II and the reigns of his three immediate successors, Amel-Marduk, Neriglissar and Labashi-Marduk. This lack of sources has had the unfortunate effect that even though Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign was the longest among the Neo-Babylonian kings, less is confidently known about it than others. Though the handful of cuneiform sources recovered, notably the Babylonian Chronicle, confirm some events of his reign, such as conflicts with the Kingdom of Judah, other events, such as the 586 BC destruction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and other military campaigns Nebuchadnezzar possibly conducted, are not covered in any known cuneiform documents.

As a result, historical reconstructions of this period generally follow secondary sources in Hebrew, Greek and Latin to determine what events transpired at the time, in addition to contract tablets from Babylonia. Though use of the sources written by later authors, many of them created several centuries after Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s time and often reflecting their own cultural attitudes to the events and figures discussed, presents problems in and of itself, blurring the line between history and tradition, it is the only possible approach to gain insight into Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign.

== Background ==

=== Name ===

Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s name in Akkadian was &quot;Nabû-kudurri-uṣur&quot;, meaning &quot;Nabu, watch over my heir&quot;. The name was often interpreted in earlier scholarship as &quot;Nabu, protect the boundary&quot;, given that the word &quot;kudurru&quot; can also mean &#x27;boundary&#x27; or &#x27;line&#x27;. Modern historians support the &#x27;heir&#x27; interpretation over the &#x27;boundary&#x27; interpretation in terms of this name. There is no reason to believe that the Babylonians intended the name to be difficult to interpret or to have a double meaning.

&quot;Nabû-kudurri-uṣur&quot; is typically anglicised to &#x27;Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;, following how the name is most commonly rendered in Hebrew and Greek, particularly in most of the Bible. In Hebrew, the name was rendered as נְבוּכַדְנֶאצַּר (&quot;Nəḇūḵaḏneʾṣṣar&quot;) and in Greek it was rendered as Ναβουχοδονόσορ (&quot;Nabouchodonosor&quot;). Some scholars, such as Donald Wiseman, prefer the anglicisation &quot;Nebuchadrezzar&quot;, with an &quot;r&quot; rather than an &quot;n&quot;, following the assumption that &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; is a later, corrupted form of the contemporary &quot;Nabû-kudurri-uṣur&quot;.

The alternative anglicisation &quot;Nebuchadrezzar&quot; derives from how the name is rendered in the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, נְבוּכַדְרֶאצַּר (&quot;Nəḇūḵaḏreʾṣṣar&quot;), a more faithful transliteration of the original Akkadian name. The Assyriologist Adrianus van Selms suggested in 1974 that the variant with an &quot;n&quot; rather than an &quot;r&quot; was a rude nickname, deriving from an Akkadian rendition like &quot;Nabû-kūdanu-uṣur&quot;, which means &#x27;Nabu, protect the mule&#x27;, though there is no concrete evidence for this idea. Van Selms believed that a nickname like that could derive from Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s early reign, which was plagued by political instability.

Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s name, &quot;Nabû-kudurri-uṣur&quot;, was identical to the name of his distant predecessor, Nebuchadnezzar I ( 1125–1104 BC), who ruled more than five centuries before Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s time. Like Nebuchadnezzar II, Nebuchadnezzar I was a renowned warrior-king who appeared in a time of political upheaval and defeated the forces of Babylon&#x27;s enemies, in Nebuchadnezzar I&#x27;s case the Elamites. Although theophoric names using the god Nabu are common in texts from the early Neo-Babylonian Empire, the name Nebuchadnezzar is relatively rare, being mentioned only four times with certainty. Though there is no evidence that Nabopolassar named his son after Nebuchadnezzar I, Nabopolassar was knowledgeable in history and actively worked to connect his rule to the rule of the Akkadian Empire, which preceded him by nearly two thousand years. The significance of his son and heir bearing the name of one of Babylon&#x27;s greatest kings would not have been lost on Nabopolassar.

If Jursa&#x27;s theory concerning Nabopolassar&#x27;s origin is correct, it is alternatively possible that Nebuchadnezzar II was named after his grandfather of the same name, as the Babylonians employed patronymics, rather than after the previous king.

=== Ancestry and early life ===

Nebuchadnezzar was the eldest son of Nabopolassar (626–605 BC), the founder of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. This is confirmed by Nabopolassar&#x27;s inscriptions, which explicitly name Nebuchadnezzar as his &quot;eldest son&quot;, as well as inscriptions from Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign, which refer to him as the &quot;first&quot; or &quot;chief son&quot; of Nabopolassar, and as Nabopolassar&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; or &quot;legitimate heir&quot;. The Neo-Babylonian Empire was founded through Nabopolassar&#x27;s rebellion, and later war, against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which liberated Babylonia after nearly a century of Assyrian control. The war resulted in the complete destruction of Assyria, and the Neo-Babylonian Empire, which rose in its place, was powerful, but hastily built and politically unstable.

As Nabopolassar never clarified his ancestry in lineage in any of his inscriptions, his origin is not entirely clear. Subsequent historians have variously identified Nabopolassar as a Chaldean, an Assyrian or a Babylonian. Although no evidence conclusively confirms him as being of Chaldean origin, the term &quot;Chaldean dynasty&quot; is frequently used by modern historians for the royal family he founded, and the term &quot;Chaldean Empire&quot; remains in use as an alternate historiographical name for the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

Nabopolassar appears to, regardless of his ethnic origin, have been strongly connected to the city of Uruk, located south of Babylon. It is possible that he was a member of its ruling elite before becoming king and there is a growing body of evidence that Nabopolassar&#x27;s family originated in Uruk, for instance that Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s daughters lived in the city. 

In 2007, Michael Jursa advanced the theory that Nabopolassar was a member of a prominent political family in Uruk, whose members are attested since the reign of Esarhaddon (681–669 BC). To support his theory, Jursa pointed to how documents describe how the grave and body of &quot;Kudurru&quot;, a deceased governor of Uruk, was desecrated due to the anti-Assyrian activities of Kudurru&#x27;s two sons, Nabu-shumu-ukin and a son whose name is mostly missing. The desecration went so far as to drag Kudurru&#x27;s body through the streets of Uruk. Kudurru can be identified with Nebuchadnezzar (&quot;Nabû-kudurri-uṣur&quot;, &quot;Kudurru&quot; simply being a common and shortened nickname), a prominent official in Uruk who served as its governor under the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (669–631 BC) in the 640s BC.

In Assyrian tradition, the desecration of a dead body showed that the deceased individual and their surviving family were traitors and enemies of the state, and that they had to be completely eradicated, serving to punish them even after death. The name of the son whose name is unpreserved in the letter ended with either &quot;ahi&quot;, &quot;nâsir&quot; or &quot;uṣur&quot;, and the remaining traces can fit with the name &quot;Nabû-apla-uṣur&quot;, meaning that Nabopolassar could be the other son mentioned in the letter and thus a son of Kudurru.

Strengthening this connection is that Nebuchadnezzar II is attested very early during his father&#x27;s reign, from 626/625 to 617 BC, as high priest of the Eanna temple in Uruk, where he is often attested under the nickname &quot;Kudurru&quot;. Nebuchadnezzar must have been made high priest at a very young age, considering that his year of death, 562 BC, is 64 years after 626 BC. The original Kudurru&#x27;s second son, Nabu-shumu-ukin, also appears to be attested as a prominent general under Nabopolassar, and the name was also used by Nebuchadnezzar II for one of his sons, possibly honoring his dead uncle.

=== Nebuchadnezzar as crown prince ===
Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s military career began in the reign of his father, though little information survives. Based on a letter sent to the temple administration of the Eanna temple, it appears that Nebuchadnezzar participated in his father&#x27;s campaign to take the city of Harran in 610 BC. Harran was the seat of Ashur-uballit II, who had rallied what remained of the Assyrian army and ruled the Neo-Assyrian rump state. The Babylonian victory in the Harran campaign and the defeat of Ashur-uballit in 609 BCE marked the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy, which would never be restored. According to the &quot;Babylonian Chronicles&quot;, Nebuchadnezzar also commanded an army in an unspecified mountainous region for several months in 607 BC.

In the war against the Babylonians and Medes, Assyria had allied with Pharaoh Psamtik I of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt, who had been interested in ensuring Assyria&#x27;s survival so that Assyria could remain as a buffer state between his own kingdom and the Babylonian and Median kingdoms. After the fall of Harran, Psamtik&#x27;s successor, Pharaoh Necho II, personally led a large army into former Assyrian lands to turn the tide of the war and restore the Neo-Assyrian Empire, even though it was more or less a lost cause as Assyria had already collapsed. As Nabopolassar was occupied with fighting Urartu in the north, the Egyptians took control of the Levant largely unopposed, capturing territories as far north as the city of Carchemish in Syria, where Necho established his base of operations.

Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s greatest victory from his time as crown prince came at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, which put an end to Necho&#x27;s campaign in the Levant by inflicting a crushing defeat on the Egyptians. Nebuchadnezzar had been the sole commander of the Babylonian army at this battle as his father had chosen to stay in Babylon, perhaps on account of illness. Necho&#x27;s forces were completely annihilated by Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s army, with Babylonian sources claiming that not a single Egyptian escaped alive. The account of the battle in the Babylonian Chronicle reads as follows:

The story of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s victory at Carchemish reverberated through history, appearing in many later ancient accounts, including in the Book of Jeremiah and the Books of Kings in the Bible. It is possible to conclude, based on subsequent geopolitics, that the victory resulted in all of Syria and Israel coming under the control of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, a feat which the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 BC) only accomplished after five years of protracted military campaigns. The defeat of Egypt at Carchemish ensured that the Neo-Babylonian Empire would grow to become the major power of the ancient Near East, and the uncontested successor of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

== Reign ==

=== Accession to the throne ===
Nabopolassar died just a few weeks after Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s victory at Carchemish. At this point in time, Nebuchadnezzar was still away on his campaign against the Egyptians, having chased the retreating Egyptian forces to the region around the city of Hamath. The news of Nabopolassar&#x27;s death reached Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s camp on 8 Abu (late July), and Nebuchadnezzar quickly arranged affairs with the Egyptians and rushed back to Babylon, where he was proclaimed king on 1 Ulūlu (mid-August). 

The speed in which Nebuchadnezzar returned to Babylon might be due to the threat that one of his brothers (two are known by name: Nabu-shum-lishir and Nabu-zer-ushabshi) could claim the throne in his absence. Though Nebuchadnezzar had been recognised as the eldest son and heir by Nabopolassar, Nabu-shum-lishir, Nabopolassar&#x27;s second-born son, had been recognised as &quot;his equal brother&quot;, a dangerously vague title. Despite these possible fears, there were no attempts made at usurping his throne at this time.

One of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s first acts as king was to bury his father. Nabopolassar was laid in a huge coffin, adorned with ornamented gold plates and fine dresses with golden beads, which was then placed within a small palace he had constructed in Babylon. Shortly thereafter, before the end of the month in which he had been crowned, Nebuchadnezzar returned to Syria to resume his campaign. The Babylonian Chronicle records that &quot;he marched about victoriously&quot;, meaning that he faced little to no resistance, returning to Babylon after several months of campaigning. The Syrian campaign, though it resulted in a certain amount of plunder, was not a complete success in that it did not ensure Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s grasp on the region. He had seemingly failed to inspire fear, given that none of the westernmost states in the Levant swore fealty to him and paid tribute.

=== Early military campaigns ===
Though little information survives concerning them, the Babylonian Chronicle preserves brief accounts of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s military activities in his first eleven years as king. In 604 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant once again, conquering the city of Ascalon. According to the Babylonian Chronicle, Ascalon&#x27;s king was captured and taken to Babylon, and the city was plundered and levelled to the ground. Modern excavations at Ascalon have confirmed that the city was more or less destroyed at this point in time. The Ascalon campaign was preceded by a campaign in Syria, which was more successful than Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s first, resulting in oaths of fealty from the rulers of Phoenicia.
In 603 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in a land whose name is not preserved in the surviving copy of the chronicle. The chronicle records that this campaign was extensive, given that the account mentions the construction of large siege towers and a siege of a city, the name of which does not survive either. Anson Rainey speculated in 1975 that the city taken was Gaza, whereas Nadav Na&#x27;aman thought in 1992 that it was Kummuh in south-eastern Anatolia. In the second half of the 5th century BC, some documents mentioned the towns Isqalanu (the name derived from Ascalon) and Hazzatu (the name possibly derived from Gaza) near the city of Nippur, indicating that deportees from both of these cities lived near Nippur, and as such possibly that they had been captured at around the same time.

In both 602 BC and 601 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant, though little information survives beyond that a &quot;vast&quot; amount of booty was brought from the Levant to Babylonia in 602 BC. On account of the entry for 602 BC also referring to Nabu-shum-lishir, Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s younger brother, in a fragmentary and unclear context, it is possible that Nabu-shum-lishir led a revolt against his brother in an attempt to usurp the throne in that year, especially since he is no longer mentioned in any sources after 602 BC. The damage to the text however makes this idea speculative and conjectural.
In the 601 BC campaign, Nebuchadnezzar departed from the Levant and then marched into Egypt. Despite the defeat at Carchemish in 605 BC, Egypt still had a great amount of influence in the Levant, even though the region was ostensibly under Babylonian rule. Thus, a campaign against Egypt was logical in order to assert Babylonian dominance, and also carried enormous economic and propagandistic benefits, but it was also risky and ambitious. The path into Egypt was difficult, and the lack of secure control of either side of the Sinai Desert could spell disaster. 

Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s invasion of Egypt failed – the Babylonian Chronicle states that both the Egyptian and Babylonian armies suffered a huge number of casualties. Though Egypt was not conquered, the campaign did result in momentarily curbing Egyptian interest in the Levant, given that Necho II gave up his ambitions in the region. In 599 BC, Nebuchadnezzar marched his army into the Levant and then attacked and raided the Arabs in the Syrian desert. Though apparently successful, it is unclear what the achievements gained in this campaign were.

In 598 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned against the Kingdom of Judah, succeeding in capturing the city of Jerusalem. Judah represented a prime target of Babylonian attention given that it was at the epicenter of competition between Babylon and Egypt. By 601 BC, Judah&#x27;s king, Jehoiakim, had begun to openly challenge Babylonian authority, counting on that Egypt would lend support to his cause. Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s first, 598–597 BC, assault on Jerusalem is recorded in the Bible, but also in the Babylonian Chronicle, which describes it as follows:

Jehoiakim had died during Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s siege and been replaced by his son, Jeconiah, who was captured and taken to Babylon, with his uncle Zedekiah installed in his place as king of Judah. Jeconiah is recorded as being alive in Babylonia thereafter, with records as late as 592 or 591 BC listing him among the recipients of food at Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s palace and still referring to him as the &#x27;king of the land of Judah&#x27;.

In 597 BC, the Babylonian army departed for the Levant again, but appears to not have engaged in any military activities as they turned back immediately after reaching the Euphrates. The following year, Nebuchadnezzar marched his army along the Tigris river to do battle with the Elamites, but no actual battle happened as the Elamites retreated out of fear once Nebuchadnezzar was a day&#x27;s march away. In 595 BC, Nebuchadnezzar stayed at home in Babylon but soon had to face a rebellion against his rule there, though he defeated the rebels, with the chronicle stating that the king &quot;put his large army to the sword and conquered his foe.&quot; Shortly thereafter, Nebuchadnezzar again campaigned in the Levant and secured large amounts of tribute. In the last year recorded in the chronicle, 594 BC, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant yet again.

There were several years without any noteworthy military activity at all. Notably, Nebuchadnezzar spent all of 600 BC in Babylon, when the chronicle excuses the king by stating that he stayed in Babylon to &quot;refit his numerous horses and chariotry&quot;. Some of the years when Nebuchadnezzar was victorious can also hardly be considered real challenges. Raiding the Arabs in 599 BC was not a major military accomplishment and the victory over Judah and the retreat of the Elamites were not secured on the battlefield. It thus appears that Nebuchadnezzar achieved little military success after the failure of his invasion of Egypt. Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s poor military record had dangerous geopolitical consequences. According to the Bible, in Zedekiah&#x27;s fourth year as king of Judah (594 BC), the kings of Ammon, Edom, Moab, Sidon and Tyre met in Jerusalem to deal with the possibility of throwing off Babylonian control. 

Evidence that Babylonian control was beginning to unravel is also clear from contemporary Babylonian records, such as the aforementioned rebellion in Babylonia itself, as well as records of a man being executed in 594 BC at Borspippa for &quot;breaking his oath to the king&quot;. The oath-breaking was serious enough that the judge in the trial was Nebuchadnezzar himself. It is also possible that Babylonian–Median relations were becoming strained, with records of a &quot;Median defector&quot; being housed in Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s palace and some inscriptions indicating that the Medes were beginning to be seen as &quot;enemies&quot;. By 594 BC, the failure of the Egyptian invasion, and the lacklustre state of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s other campaigns, loomed high. According to the Assyriologist Israel Ephʿal, Babylon at this time was seen by its contemporaries more like a &quot;paper tiger&quot; (i. e. an ineffectual threat) than a great empire, like Assyria just a few decades prior.
=== Destruction of Jerusalem ===
From his appointment as king of Judah, Zedekiah waited for the opportune moment to throw off Babylonian control. After Pharaoh Necho II&#x27;s death in 595 BC, Egyptian intervention in affairs in the Levant increased once again under his successors, Psamtik II (595–589 BC) and Apries (589–570 BC), who both worked to encourage anti-Babylonian rebellions. It is possible that the Babylonian failure to invade Egypt in 601 BC helped inspire revolts against the Babylonian Empire. The outcome of these efforts was Zedekiah&#x27;s open revolt against Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s authority. Unfortunately, no cuneiform sources are preserved from this time and the only known account of the fall of Judah is the biblical account.
In 589 BC, Zedekiah refused to pay tribute to Nebuchadnezzar, and he was closely followed in this by Ithobaal III, the king of Tyre. In 587 BC, Ammon, Edom and Moab likewise rebelled. In response to Zedekiah&#x27;s uprising, Nebuchadnezzar conquered and destroyed the Kingdom of Judah in 586 BC, one of the great achievements of his reign. The campaign, which probably ended in the summer of 586 BC, resulted in the plunder and destruction of the city of Jerusalem, a permanent end to Judah, and it led to the Babylonian captivity, as the Jews were captured and deported to Babylonia. Archaeological excavations confirm that Jerusalem and the surrounding area was destroyed and depopulated. It is possible that the intensity of the destruction carried out by Nebuchadnezzar at Jerusalem and elsewhere in the Levant was due to the implementation of something akin to a scorched earth-policy, aimed at stopping Egypt from gaining a foothold there.

Some Jewish administration was allowed to remain in the region under the governor Gedaliah, governing from Mizpah under close Babylonian monitoring. According to the Bible, and the 1st-century AD Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, Zedekiah attempted to flee after resisting the Babylonians, but was captured at Jericho and suffered a terrible fate. According to the narrative, Nebuchadnezzar wanted to make an example out of him given that Zedekiah was not an ordinary vassal, but a vassal directly appointed by Nebuchadnezzar. As such, Zedekiah was supposedly taken to Riblah in northern Syria, where he had to watch his sons being executed before having his eyes gouged out and sent to be imprisoned in Babylon.

Per the Books of Kings in the Bible, the campaign against Judah was longer than typical Mesopotamian wars, with the siege of Jerusalem lasting 18–30 months (depending on the calculation), rather than the typical length of less than a year. Whether the unusual length of the siege indicates that the Babylonian army was weak, unable to break into the city for more than a year, or that Nebuchadnezzar by this time had succeeded in stabilising his rule in Babylonia and could thus wage war patiently without being pressured by time to escalate the siege, is not certain.

=== Later military campaigns ===
It is possible that the Egyptians took advantage of the Babylonians being preoccupied with besieging Jerusalem. Herodotus describes Pharaoh Apries as campaigning in the Levant, taking the city of Sidon and fighting the Tyrians, which indicates a renewed Egyptian invasion of the Levant. Apries is unlikely to have been as successful as Herodotus describes, given that it is unclear how the Egyptian navy would have defeated the superior navies of the Phoenician cities, and even if some cities had been taken, they must have shortly thereafter fallen into Babylonian hands again. Tyre had rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar at around the same time as Judah, and Nebuchadnezzar moved to retake the city after his successful subduing of the Jews.

The biblical Book of Ezekiel describes Tyre in 571 BC as if it had been recently captured by the Babylonian army. The supposed length of the siege, 13 years, is only given by Flavius Josephus, and is subject to debate among modern scholars. Josephus&#x27;s account of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign is obviously not entirely historic, as he describes Nebuchadnezzar as, five years after the destruction of Jerusalem, invading Egypt, capturing the Pharaoh and appointing another Pharaoh in his place. A stele from Tahpanhes uncovered in 2011 records that Nebuchadnezzar attempted to invade Egypt in 582 BC, although Apries&#x27; forces managed to repel the invasion. 

Josephus states that Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre in the seventh year of &quot;his&quot; reign, though it is unclear whether &quot;his&quot; in this context refers to Nebuchadnezzar or to Ithobaal III of Tyre. If it refers to Nebuchadnezzar, a siege begun in 598 BC and lasting for thirteen years, later simultaneously with the siege of Jerusalem, is unlikely to have gone unmentioned in Babylonian records. If the seventh year of Ithobaal is intended, the beginning of the siege may conjecturally be placed after Jerusalem&#x27;s fall. If the siege lasting 13 years is taken at face value, the siege would then not have ended before 573 or 572 BC. The supposed length of the siege can be ascribed to the difficulty in besieging the city: Tyre was located on an island 800 metres from the coast, and could not be taken without naval support. Though the city withstood numerous sieges, it would not be captured until Alexander the Great&#x27;s siege in 332 BC.

In the end, the siege was resolved without a need of battle and did not result in the Tyre being conquered. It seems Tyre&#x27;s king and Nebuchadnezzar came to an agreement for Tyre to continue to be ruled by vassal kings, though probably under heavier Babylonian control than before. Documents from Tyre near the end of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign demonstrate that the city had become a centre for Babylonian military affairs in the region. According to later Jewish tradition, it is possible that Ithobaal III was deposed and taken as a prisoner to Babylon, with another king, Baal II, proclaimed by Nebuchadnezzar in his place.

It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar campaigned against Egypt in 568 BC, given that a fragmentary Babylonian inscription, given the modern designation BM 33041, from that year records the word &quot;Egypt&quot; as well as possibly traces of the name &quot;Amasis&quot; (the name of the then incumbent Pharaoh, Amasis II, 570–526 BC). A stele of Amasis, also fragmentary, may also describe a combined naval and land attack by the Babylonians. Recent evidence suggests that the Babylonians were initially successful during the invasion and gained a foothold in Egypt, but they were repelled by Amasis&#x27; forces. If Nebuchadnezzar did campaign against Egypt again, he was unsuccessful again, given that Egypt did not come under Babylonian rule.

Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s campaigns in the Levant, most notably those directed towards Jerusalem and Tyre, completed the Neo-Babylonian Empire&#x27;s transformation from a rump state of the Neo-Assyrian Empire to the new dominant power of the ancient Near East. Still, Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s military accomplishments can be questioned, given that the borders of his empire, by the end of his reign, had not noticeably increased in size and that he had not managed to conquer Egypt. Even after a reign of several decades, Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s greatest victory remained his victory over the Egyptians at Carchemish in 605 BC, before he even became king.

=== Building projects ===

The Babylonian king was traditionally a builder and restorer, and as such large-scale building projects were important as a legitimizing factor for Babylonian rulers. Nebuchadnezzar extensively expanded and rebuilt his capital city of Babylon and the most modern historical and archaeological interpretations of the city reflect it as it appeared after Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s construction projects. The projects were made possible through the prospering economy during Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign, sustained by his conquests. His building inscriptions record work done to numerous temples, notably the restoration of the Esagila, the main temple of Babylon&#x27;s national deity Marduk, and the completion of the Etemenanki, a great ziggurat dedicated to Marduk.

Extensive work was also conducted on civil and military structures. Among the most impressive efforts was the work done surrounding the city&#x27;s northern ceremonial entrance, the Ishtar Gate. These projects included restoration work on the South Palace, inside the city walls, the construction of a completely new North Palace, on the other side of the walls facing the gate, as well as the restoration of Babylon&#x27;s Processional Street, which led through the gate, and of the gate itself. The ruins of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s North Palace are poorly preserved and as such its structure and appearance are not entirely understood. Nebuchadnezzar also constructed a third palace, the Summer Palace, built some distance north of the inner city walls in the northernmost corner of the outer walls.

The restored Ishtar Gate was decorated with blue and yellow glazed bricks and depictions of bulls (symbols of the god Adad) and dragons (symbols of the god Marduk). Similar bricks were used for the walls surrounding the Processional Street, which also featured depictions of lions (symbols of the goddess Ishtar). Babylon&#x27;s Processional Street, the only such street yet excavated in Mesopotamia, ran along the eastern walls of the South Palace and exited the inner city walls at the Ishtar Gate, running past the North Palace. To the south, this street went by the Etemenanki, turning to the west and going over a bridge constructed either under the reign of Nabopolassar or Nebuchadnezzar.

Some of the bricks of the Processional Street bear the name of the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib (705–681 BC) on their underside, perhaps indicating that construction of the street had begun already during his reign, but the fact that the upper side of the bricks all bear the name of Nebuchadnezzar suggests that construction of the street was completed under Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign. Glazed bricks such as the ones used in the Procession Street were also used in the throne room of the South Palace, which was decorated with depictions of lions and tall, stylized palm trees.

Nebuchadnezzar also directed building efforts on the city of Borsippa, with several of his inscriptions recording restoration work on that city&#x27;s temple, the Ezida, dedicated to the god Nabu. Additionally, Nebuchadnezzar also restored the ziggurat of the Ezida, the E-urme-imin-anki, and also worked on the temple of Gula, Etila, as well as numerous other temples and shrines in the city. Nebuchadnezzar also repaired Borsippa&#x27;s walls.

Other great building projects by Nebuchadnezzar include the Nar-Shamash, a canal to bring water from the Euphrates close to the city of Sippar, and the Median Wall, a large defensive structure built to defend Babylonia against incursions from the north. The Median Wall was one of two walls built to protect Babylonia&#x27;s northern border. Further evidence that Nebuchadnezzar believed the north to be the most likely point of attack for his enemies comes from that he fortified the walls of northern cities, such as Babylon, Borsippa and Kish, but left the walls of southern cities, such as Ur and Uruk, as they were. Nebuchadnezzar also began work on the Royal Canal, also known as Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s Canal, a great canal linking the Euphrates to the Tigris which in time completely transformed the agriculture of the region, but the structure was not completed until the reign of Nabonidus, who ruled as the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire from 556 to 539 BC.

=== Death and succession ===
Nebuchadnezzar died at Babylon in 562 BC. The last known tablet dated to Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign, from Uruk, is dated to the same day, 7 October, as the first known tablet of his successor, Amel-Marduk, from Sippar. Amel-Marduk&#x27;s administrative duties probably began before he became king, during the last few weeks or months of his father&#x27;s reign when Nebuchadnezzar was ill and dying. Having ruled for 43 years, Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign was the longest of his dynasty and he would be remembered favourably by the Babylonians.

Amel-Marduk&#x27;s accession does not appear to have gone smoothly. Amel-Marduk was not the eldest living son of Nebuchadnezzar and the reason why he was picked as crown prince is not known. The choice is especially strange given that some sources suggest that the relationship between Nebuchadnezzar and Amel-Marduk was particularly poor, with one surviving text describing both as parties in some form of conspiracy and accusing one of them (the text is too fragmentary to determine which one) of failing in the most important duties of Babylonian kingship through exploiting Babylon&#x27;s populace and desecrating its temples. Amel-Marduk also at one point appears to have been imprisoned by his father, possibly on account of the Babylonian aristocracy having proclaimed him as king while Nebuchadnezzar was away. It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar intended to replace Amel-Marduk as heir with another son, but died before doing so.

In one of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s late inscriptions, written more than forty years into his reign, he wrote that he had been chosen for the kingship by the gods before he was even born. Mesopotamian rulers typically only stressed divine legitimacy in this fashion when their actual legitimacy was questionable, a method often employed by usurpers. Given that Nebuchadnezzar at this point had been king for several decades and was the legitimate heir of his predecessor, the inscription is very strange, unless it was intended to help legitimize Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s successor, Amel-Marduk, who as a younger son and a former conspirator could be seen as politically problematic.

== Family and children ==

No surviving contemporary Babylonian documents provide the name of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s wife. According to Berossus, her name was Amytis, daughter of Cyaxares, king of the Medes. Berossus writes that &#x27;[Nabopolassar] sent troops to the assistance of Astyages, the tribal chieftain and satrap of the Medes in order to obtain a daughter of Astyages, Amyitis, as wife for his son [Nebuchadnezzar]&#x27;. Though the ancient Greek historian Ctesias instead wrote that Amytis was the name of a daughter of Astyages who had married Cyrus I of Persia, it seems more likely that a Median princess would marry a member of the Babylonian royal family, considering the good relations established between the two during Nabopolassar&#x27;s reign. 

Given that Astyages was still too young during Nabopolassar&#x27;s reign to already have children, and was not yet king, it seems more probable that Amytis was Astyages&#x27;s sister, and thus a daughter of his predecessor, Cyaxares. By marrying his son to a daughter of Cyaxares, Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s father Nabopolassar likely sought to seal the alliance between the Babylonians and the Medes. 

According to tradition, Nebuchadnezzar constructed the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, featuring exotic shrubs, vines and trees as well as artificial hills, watercourses and knolls, so that Amytis would feel less homesick for the mountains of Media. No archaeological evidence for these gardens has yet been found.

Nebuchadnezzar had six known sons. Most of the sons, with the exceptions of Marduk-nadin-ahi and Eanna-sharra-usur, are attested very late in their father&#x27;s reign. It is possible that they might have been the product of a second marriage and that they could have been born relatively late in Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign, possibly after his known daughters. The known sons of Nebuchadnezzar are:
* Marduk-nadin-ahi (Akkadian: &quot;Marduk-nādin-aḫi&quot;) – the earliest attested of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s children, attested in a legal document, probably as an adult as he is described as being in charge of his own land, already in Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s third year as king (602/601 BC). Presumably Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s firstborn son, if not eldest child, and thus his legitimate heir. He is also attested very late in Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign, named as a &quot;royal prince&quot; in a document recording the purchase of dates by Sin-mār-šarri-uṣur, his servant, in 563 BC.
*Eanna-sharra-usur (Akkadian: &quot;Eanna-šarra-uṣur&quot;) – named as a &quot;royal prince&quot; among sixteen people in a document at Uruk from 587 BC recorded as receiving barley &quot;for the sick&quot;.
*Amel-Marduk (Akkadian: &quot;Amēl-Marduk&quot;), originally named Nabu-shum-ukin (&quot;Nabû-šum-ukīn&quot;) – succeeded Nebuchadnezzar as king in 562 BC. His reign was marred with intrigues and he only ruled for two years before being murdered and usurped by his brother-in-law, Neriglissar. Later Babylonian sources mostly speak ill of his reign. Amel-Marduk is first attested, notably as crown prince, in a document 566 BC. Given that Amel-Marduk had an older brother in Marduk-nadin-ahi, alive as late as 563 BC, why he was named crown prince is not clear.
* Marduk-shum-usur (Akkadian: &quot;Marduk-šum-uṣur&quot; or &quot;Marduk-šuma-uṣur&quot;) – named as a &quot;royal prince&quot; in documents from Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s 564 BC and 562 BC years, recording payments by his scribe to the Ebabbar temple in Sippar.
* Mushezib-Marduk (Akkadian: &quot;Mušēzib-Marduk&quot;) – named as a &quot;royal prince&quot; once in a contract tablet from 563 BC.
*Marduk-nadin-shumi (Akkadian: &quot;Marduk-nādin-šumi&quot;) – named as a &quot;royal prince&quot; once in a contract tablet from 563 BC.
Three of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s daughters are known by name:

* Kashshaya (Akkadian: &quot;Kaššaya&quot;) – attested in several economic documents from Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s reign as &quot;the king&#x27;s daughter&quot;. Her name is of unclear origin; it might be derived from the word &quot;kaššû&quot; (kassite). Kashshaya is attested from contemporary texts as a resident of (and landowner in) Uruk. Kashshaya is typically, although speculatively, identified as the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar who married Neriglissar.
* Innin-etirat (Akkadian: &quot;Innin-ēṭirat&quot;) – attested as &quot;the king&#x27;s daughter&quot; in a 564 BC document which records her granting &quot;mār-banûtu&quot; status (&quot;status of a free man&quot;) to a slave by the name Nabû-mukkê-elip. The document in question was written at Babylon, but names including the divine prefix Innin are almost unique to Uruk, suggesting that she was a resident of that city.
* Ba&#x27;u-asitu (Akkadian: &quot;Ba&#x27;u-asītu&quot;) – attested as the owner of a piece of real estate in an economic document. The precise reading and meaning of her name is somewhat unclear. Paul-Alain Beaulieu, who in 1998 published the translated text which confirms her existence, believes that her name is best interpreted as meaning &quot;Ba&#x27;u is a/the physician&quot;. The document was written at Uruk, where Ba&#x27;u-asitu is presumed to have lived.
It is possible that one of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s daughters married the high official Nabonidus, although there is no evidence for this. Marriage to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar could explain how Nabonidus could become king, and also explain why certain later traditions, such as the Book of Daniel in the Bible, describe Nabonidus&#x27;s son, Belshazzar, as Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s son (descendant). Alternatively, these later traditions might instead derive from royal propaganda. 

The ancient Greek historian Herodotus names the &quot;last great queen&quot; of the Babylonian Empire as &quot;Nitocris&quot;, though that name, nor any other name, is not attested in contemporary Babylonian sources. Herodotus&#x27;s description of Nitocris contains a wealth of legendary material that makes it difficult to determine whether he uses the name to refer to Nabonidus&#x27;s wife or mother. In 1982, William H. Shea proposed that Nitocris may tentatively be identified as the name of Nabonidus&#x27;s wife and Belshazzar&#x27;s mother.

== Legacy ==

=== Assessment by historians ===
Because of the scarcity of sources, assessment by historians of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s character and the nature of his reign have differed considerably over time. He has typically been regarded as the greatest and most prestigious king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

Since military activity was not a major issue described in the inscriptions of any Neo-Babylonian king regardless of their actual military accomplishments, in sharp contrast to the inscriptions of their Neo-Assyrian predecessors, Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s own inscriptions record very little about his wars. Out of the fifty or so known inscriptions by the king, only a single one deals with military action, and in this case only small-scale conflicts in the Lebanon region. Many Assyriologists, such as Wolfram von Soden in 1954, thus initially assumed that Nebuchadnezzar had mainly been a builder-king, devoting his energy and efforts to building and restoring his country.

A major change in evaluations of Nebuchadnezzar came with the publication of the tablets of the Babylonian Chronicle by Donald Wiseman in 1956, which cover the geopolitical events of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s first eleven years as king. From the publication of these tablets and onwards, historians have shifted to perceiving Nebuchadnezzar as a great warrior, devoting special attention to the military achievements of his reign.

According to the historian Josette Elayi, writing in 2018, Nebuchadnezzar is somewhat difficult to characterise on account of the scarcity of Babylonian source material. Elayi wrote, about Nebuchadnezzar, that &quot;[h]e was a conqueror, even though reservations can be had about his military capabilities. There was no lack of statesmanlike qualities, given his success in building the Babylonian Empire. He was a great builder, who restored a country that for a long time had been devastated by war. That is roughly all we know about him because the Babylonian Chronicles and other texts say little about his personality.&quot;

=== In Jewish and biblical tradition ===

The Babylonian captivity initiated by Nebuchadnezzar came to an end with the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great in 539 BC. Within a year of their liberation, some exiled Jews returned to their homeland. Their liberation did little to erase the memory of five decades of imprisonment and oppression. Instead, Jewish literary accounts ensured that accounts of the hardship endured by the Jews, as well as of the monarch responsible for it, would be remembered for all time. The Book of Jeremiah calls Nebuchadnezzar a &quot;lion&quot; and a &quot;destroyer of nations&quot;.

Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s story thus found its way into the Old Testament of the Bible. The Bible narrates how Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Kingdom of Judah, besieged, plundered and destroyed Jerusalem, and how he took away the Jews in captivity, portraying him as a cruel enemy of the Jewish people. The Bible also portrays Nebuchadnezzar as the legitimate ruler of all the nations of the world, appointed to rule the world by God. As such, Judah, through divine ruling, should have obeyed Nebuchadnezzar and should not have rebelled. Nebuchadnezzar is also depicted as carrying out death sentences pronounced by God, slaying two false prophets. Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s campaigns of conquest against other nations are portrayed as being in-line with God&#x27;s will for Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s dominance.

Nebuchadnezzar is referred to three times in the Book of Jeremiah using the epithet &#x27;my servant&#x27; [God&#x27;s servant] – a title usually limited to some of the most positively portrayed figures, such as Jacob and David. Klaas A. D. Smelik noted in 2004 that &quot;in the Hebrew Bible, there is no better company conceivable than these; at the same time, there is no candidate less likely for this title of honour than the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar&quot;. 

It is possible that the epithet is a later addition, as it is missing in the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, perhaps added after Nebuchadnezzar began to be seen in a slightly more favourable light than immediately after Jerusalem&#x27;s destruction. Alternatively, possible theological explanations include Nebuchadnezzar being seen, despite his cruelty, as an instrument in fulfilling God&#x27;s universal plan; or perhaps that designating him as a &quot;servant&quot; of God was to show that readers should not fear Nebuchadnezzar, but his true master, God.
In the Book of Daniel, widely considered by scholars to be a work of historical fiction, the figure of Nebuchadnezzar differs considerably from his portrayal in the Book of Jeremiah. He is for the most part depicted as a merciless and despotic ruler. The king has a nightmare, and asks his wise men, including Daniel and his three companions Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, to interpret the dream, but refuses to state the dream&#x27;s contents. When the servants protest, Nebuchadnezzar sentences all of them, including Daniel and his companions, to death.

By the end of the story, when Daniel has successfully interpreted the dream, Nebuchadnezzar shows much gratitude, showering Daniel with gifts, appointing him the governor of the &quot;province of Babylon&quot; and making him the chief of the kingdom&#x27;s wise men. A second story again casts Nebuchadnezzar as a tyrannical and pagan king, who, after Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego refuse to worship a newly erected golden statue, sentences them to death through being thrown into a fiery furnace. They are miraculously delivered, and Nebuchadnezzar then acknowledges God as the &quot;lord of kings&quot; and &quot;god of gods&quot;.

Though Nebuchadnezzar is also mentioned as acknowledging the Hebrews&#x27; God as the true god in other passages of the Book of Daniel, it is apparent that his supposed conversion to Judaism does not change his violent character, given that he proclaims that anyone who speaks amiss of God &quot;shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill&quot;. In a third story, Daniel interprets another dream as meaning that Nebuchadnezzar will lose his mind and live like an animal for seven years before being restored to his normal state (Daniel 1-4). The Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel, a fickle tyrant who is not particularly consistent in his faith, contrasts with the typical &quot;servant of God&quot; in other books of the Bible.
Given that Nebuchadnezzar is referred to as the father of Belshazzar in the Book of Daniel, it is probable that this portrayal of Nebuchadnezzar, especially the story of his madness, was actually based on Belshazzar&#x27;s actual father, Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (556–539 BC). Separate Jewish and Hellenistic traditions exist concerning Nabonidus having been mad, and it is likely that this madness was simply reattributed to Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel through conflation. 

Some later traditions conflated Nebuchadnezzar with other rulers as well, such as the Assyrian Ashurbanipal (669–631 BC), the Persian Artaxerxes III (358–338 BC), the Seleucids Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164 BC) and Demetrius I Soter (161–150 BC) and the Armenian Tigranes the Great (95–55 BC). The apocryphal Book of Judith, which probably applies the name &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; to Tigranes the Great of Armenia, refers to Nebuchadnezzar as a &quot;king of the Assyrians&quot;, rather than of the Babylonians, and demonstrates that Nebuchadnezzar was still viewed as an evil king, responsible for destroying Jerusalem, looting its temple, taking the Jews hostage in Babylon, and for the various misdeeds ascribed to him in later Jewish writings.

===Other===
Nebuchadnezzar is referred to as () in works of the mediaeval scholar al-Ṭabarī, where he is credited with conquering Egypt, Syria, Phoenicia and Arabia. The historical Nebuchadnezzar never conquered Egypt, and it appears that al-Ṭabarī transferred to him the achievements of the Assyrian king Esarhaddon (). In similar fashion Strabo, citing Megasthenes, mentioned in a list of mythical and semi-legendary conquerors, a &quot;Nabocodrosor&quot; as having led an army to the Pillars of Hercules and being revered by the Chaldaeans.

== Titles ==

In most of his inscriptions, Nebuchadnezzar is typically only titled as &quot;Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon&quot; or &quot;Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the one who provides for Esagil and Ezida, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon&quot;. In economic documents, Nebuchadnezzar is also ascribed the ancient title &quot;king of the Universe&quot;, and he sometimes also used the title &quot;king of Sumer and Akkad&quot;, used by all the Neo-Babylonian kings. Some inscriptions accord Nebuchadnezzar more elaborate version of his titles, including the following variant, attested in an inscription from Babylon:

<text>Gaspar Corte-Real (1450–1501) was a Portuguese explorer who, alongside his father João Vaz Corte-Real and brother Miguel, participated in various exploratory voyages sponsored by the Portuguese Crown. These voyages are said to have been some of the first to reach Newfoundland and possibly other parts of eastern Canada.

==Early life==
Gaspar was born into the noble Corte-Real family on Terceira in the Azores Islands, the youngest of three sons of Portuguese explorer João Vaz Corte-Real (c. 1420–1496). Gaspar accompanied his father on expeditions to North America. His brothers were explorers as well.

==Careers==
In 1498, King Manuel I of Portugal took an interest in western exploration, likely believing that the lands recently discovered by John Cabot (the coast of North America) were within the realm of Portuguese control under the Treaty of Tordesillas. Corte-Real was one of several explorers to sail west on behalf of Portugal.

In 1500, Corte-Real reached Greenland, believing it to be east Asia (as Christopher Columbus had regarded the New World), but was unable to land. He set out on a second voyage in 1501, taking three caravels. The expedition was again prevented from landing at Greenland due to frozen seas. They changed course, and landed in a country of large rivers, pine trees, and berries, believed to be Labrador. There it is believed they captured 57 indigenous people, who were taken back to Portugal to be sold into slavery to assist in financing the voyage. Two of the expedition&#x27;s three ships made the return trip to Portugal, but the ship carrying Corte-Real was lost.

Nothing more was heard of Gaspar Corte-Real after 1501. His brother Miguel attempted to find him in 1502, but he too got lost.
==Legacy==

There is debate amongst historians about the relative importance of Corte-Real. Memorial University of Newfoundland historian Jeff Webb stated in 2017 that &quot;He is a minor figure about whom very, very little is known with confidence.&quot; The 20th-century myth-building of Corte-Real was largely the work of historian-diplomat Eduardo Brazao, the former National Secretary of Portugal&#x27;s propaganda ministry, the Secretariado Nacional de Informação, Cultura Popular e Turismo, during the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar.

A statue of Corte-Real was erected in front of the Confederation Building in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador in 1965, and has more recently been the subject of controversy. A street in Mount Pearl is named for the explorer. A building at Memorial University of Newfoundland&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s campus was formerly named after him. In December 2019, the Board of Regents voted to change its name to the Global Learning Centre, after prompting by the Internationalization Office that the building presently houses.

=== St. John&#x27;s statue ===
In May 1963, Brazao, then the Portuguese Ambassador to Canada, visited St. John&#x27;s to meet with premier Joseph Smallwood. Following conversations with Brazao, Smallwood announced on 28 May 1963 that the Portuguese fishing fleet &quot;with the hearty approval of the government of Portugal&quot; would commission &quot;a famous Portuguese sculptor&quot; to create a statue that would depict both Gaspar Corte-Real and his brother Miguel. Following their meeting, Brazao invited Smallwood to Portugal, where Smallwood met with Salazar in October of that year.

Two years later, a statue of Corte-Real (minus Miguel) was presented under the banner of the Canadian Portuguese Fisheries Organisation in 1965 to commemorate the hospitality of Newfoundlanders towards Portuguese Grand Banks fishermen.

In early 1999, a car, apparently chauffeured by a speeding tourist, slammed into the pedestal that supports the statue. The statue itself was unscathed, but its base was mangled. Later that year, Ottawa bronze restoration specialist Craig Johnson subcontracted local foundry sculptors to undertake the repairs while Johnson himself repainted the statue. According to local sculptor Will Gill, who did some of the work, no scars remain from the accident and the statue was returned to its original condition.

In 2020, it was noted that the statue, designed by Estado Novo propagandist Martins Correa, was erected as part of a behind-the-scenes fisheries rights conflict between Salazar and Spain&#x27;s Francisco Franco. In 1968, Smallwood had announced that &quot;Generalissimo Franco is to present a statue to the province&quot; which would have been erected beside the statue of Corte-Real; this second statue was never delivered.

On June 11, 2020, Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball was quoted as saying the government would review politically sensitive provincial statues. Author Edward Riche noted on June 20, 2020, &quot;If enough people now see the statue of Corte-Real as memorializing a character who enslaved Indigenous people during his imperial ventures, we have a problem.&quot; 

On June 28, 2020, it was reported that Todd Russell, president of NunatuKavut, which represents Inuit in central and southern Labrador, &quot;doesn&#x27;t need any more consultation — he wants it taken down.&quot; On July 8, 2020, it was reported that the statue had been spray-painted with the phrases &quot;Slaver&quot; and &quot;Why is this guy still here?&quot; Various opinion pieces and letters to the editor called for the statue&#x27;s removal. The statue was further vandalized in July 2021, following the discovery of unmarked graves of Indigenous children on properties part of the Canadian Indian residential school system. A government working group made recommendations on the statue in February 2022; no action had been taken by July 2023.

<text> (German Museum of Technology) in Berlin, Germany is a museum of science and technology, and exhibits a large collection of historical technical artifacts. The museum&#x27;s main emphasis originally was on rail transport, but today it also features exhibits of various sorts of industrial technology. In 2003, it opened both maritime and aviation exhibition halls in a newly built extension. The museum also contains a science center called Spectrum.

==History==
The Museum of Traffic and Technology (&#x27;) was founded in 1982 and assumed the tradition of the Royal Museum of Traffic and Construction (&#x27;) which was opened in the former station building in 1906. The present-day museum is located on the former freight yard attached to the in the district of Berlin, including two historic roundhouses and several office buildings.

Renamed &quot;&quot; in 1996, the exhibition area was gradually expanded. An adjacent new building complex was inaugurated in 2003, topped by a prominent US Air Force Douglas C-47B &quot;Raisin Bomber&quot;, which can be seen with ease from the top of the and formerly at the Tempelhof Airport.

==Collections==

=== Locomotives ===

An extensive railway collection opened in 1987/88 in the rebuilt 19th century roundhouses of the Anhalter Bahnhof locomotive depot (&#x27;) that had lain derelict for about 30 years. The 33 tracks illustrate the history of rail transport, including the deportations of Jews and others by the &#x27; in The Holocaust. The exhibition also features a H0 scale model of the track installations.

Locomotives on display include:

==== Steam ====

* 17 008, a Prussian S 10, which has been sectioned.
* 50 001 of DRB Class 50

==== Other ====

* E 19 01, one of four members of DRG Class E 19 (1938)
* 118 075 of DR Class V 180
* V 200 018, of DB Class V 200 (1957)
* 202 , one of three Henschel-BBC DE2500 prototypes (1971 or 1974)

=== Aircraft ===

A large aviation section beside the C-47 houses numerous aircraft from the single to a &quot;Lufthansa&quot; Junkers Ju 52 (Spanish aircraft built by CASA under license) and an Arado Ar 79. The museum addresses the flight enthusiasm of the early 20th century and its abuse in the German re-armament building up the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, documented by an Arado Ar 96, a wrecked Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bomber and the current restoration of a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor as well as by one of three preserved Messerschmitt Bf 110, a Flak cannon, and a V-1 flying bomb built by Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp inmates at the Mittelwerk site. Post-war aircraft including a VFW-Fokker 614 and the Cessna 172P that Mathias Rust flew to the Moscow Red Square during the Cold War have also been added to the exhibition.

The remains of Avro Lancaster B III &quot;JA914&quot; are displayed. This aircraft served with 57 Squadron as DX-O. It was shot down over Berlin in September 1943 and crashed into a lake opposite Zahrensdorf.

=== Computers ===

On 15 May 2002, a special exhibition opened which featured the inventions of computer pioneer Konrad Zuse, including a replica of the Z1 and several other Zuse computers.

== Buildings ==

The museum has two windmills (one German, one Dutch), a brewery, and a forge powered by a water wheel.

<doc id="52357" wikidata="Q3519050" url="?curid=52357" title="Eroticism">
<text>Eroticism () is a quality that causes sexual feelings, as well as a philosophical contemplation concerning the aesthetics of sexual desire, sensuality, and romantic love. That quality may be found in any form of artwork, including painting, sculpture, photography, drama, film, music, or literature. It may also be found in advertising. The term may also refer to a state of sexual arousal or anticipation of such – an insistent sexual impulse, desire, or pattern of thoughts.

As French novelist Honoré de Balzac stated, eroticism is dependent not just upon an individual&#x27;s sexual morality, but also the culture and time in which an individual resides.

==Definitions==
Because the nature of what is erotic is fluid, early definitions of the term attempted to conceive eroticism as some form of sensual or romantic love or as the human sex drive (libido); for example, the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of 1755 states that the erotic &quot;is an epithet which is applied to everything with a connection to the love of the sexes; one employs it particularly to characterize...a dissoluteness, an excess&quot;. Libertine literature such as those by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester evoked eroticism to the readers.

Because eroticism is wholly dependent on the viewer&#x27;s culture and personal tastes pertaining to what, exactly, defines the erotic, critics have often confused eroticism with pornography, with anti-pornography activist Andrea Dworkin saying, &quot;Erotica is simply high-class pornography; better produced, better conceived, better executed, better packaged, designed for a better class of consumer.&quot; This confusion, as Lynn Hunt writes, &quot;demonstrate[s] the difficulty of drawing... a clear generic demarcation between the erotic and the pornographic&quot;: &quot;the history of the separation of pornography from eroticism... remains to be written&quot;.

Audre Lorde recognises eroticism and pornography as “two diametrically opposed uses of the sexual”, defining the erotic as “a measure between the beginnings of our sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings.” In her 1978 essay, &quot;Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power&quot;, Lorde identifies the erotic as a source of creative power that is deeply rooted in a spiritual plane of unrecognised or unexpressed feeling and sensation.

==Psychoanalytical approach==

Influenced by Sigmund Freud, psychotherapists have turned to Greek philosophy for an understanding of eros&#x27; heightened aesthetic. For Plato, Eros takes an almost transcendent manifestation when the subject seeks to go beyond itself and form a communion with the object/other: &quot;the true order of going...to the things of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps...to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty&quot;.

==French philosophy==
Modern French conceptions of eroticism can be traced to the Age of Enlightenment, when &quot;in the eighteenth century, dictionaries defined the erotic as that which concerned love...eroticism was the intrusion into the public sphere of something that was at base private&quot;. This theme of intrusion or transgression was taken up in the twentieth century by the French philosopher Georges Bataille, who argued that eroticism performs a function of dissolving boundaries between human subjectivity and humanity, a transgression that dissolves the rational world but is always temporary, as well as that, &quot;Desire in eroticism is the desire that triumphs over the taboo. It presupposes man in conflict with himself&quot;. For Bataille, as well as many French theorists, &quot;Eroticism, unlike simple sexual activity, is a psychological quest...eroticism is assenting to life even in death&quot;.

==Non-heterosexual==

Queer theory and LGBTQ studies consider the concept from a non-heterosexual perspective, viewing psychoanalytical and modernist views of eroticism as both archaic and heterosexist, written primarily by and for a &quot;handful of elite, heterosexual, bourgeois men&quot; who &quot;mistook their own repressed sexual proclivities&quot; as the norm.

Theorists like Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Gayle S. Rubin and Marilyn Frye all write extensively about eroticism from a heterosexual, lesbian and separatist point of view, respectively, seeing eroticism as both a political force and cultural critique for marginalized groups, or as Mario Vargas Llosa summarized: &quot;Eroticism has its own moral justification because it says that pleasure is enough for me; it is a statement of the individual&#x27;s sovereignty&quot;.

Audre Lorde, a lesbian Caribbean-American writer and outspoken feminist, called the erotic a source of power specifically identified with the female, often corrupted or distorted by oppression, since it poses the challenge of change. &quot;For women, this has meant a suppression of the erotic as a considered source of power and information within our lives&quot;. In &quot;The Uses of the Erotic&quot; within &quot;Sister Outsider&quot;, she discusses how the erotic comes from the sharing of joy, &quot;whether physical, emotional, psychic, or intellectual&quot; and provides the basis on which understanding provides a foundation for acknowledging difference. Lorde suggests that if we suppress the erotic rather than recognize its presence, it takes on a different form. Rather than enjoying and sharing with one another, it becomes objectifying, which she says translates into abuse as we attempt to hide and suppress our experiences.

<text>The imaginary unit or unit imaginary number () is a mathematical constant that is a solution to the quadratic equation Although there is no real number with this property, can be used to extend the real numbers to what are called complex numbers, using addition and multiplication. A simple example of the use of in a complex number is 

Imaginary numbers are an important mathematical concept; they extend the real number system formula_1 to the complex number system formula_2 in which at least one root for every nonconstant polynomial exists (see Algebraic closure and Fundamental theorem of algebra). Here, the term &quot;imaginary&quot; is used because there is no real number having a negative square.

There are two complex square roots of and , just as there are two complex square roots of every real number other than zero (which has one double square root).

In contexts in which use of the letter is ambiguous or problematic, the letter is sometimes used instead. For example, in electrical engineering and control systems engineering, the imaginary unit is normally denoted by instead of , because is commonly used to denote electric current.

== Terminology ==

Square roots of negative numbers are called &quot;imaginary&quot; because in early-modern mathematics, only what are now called real numbers, obtainable by physical measurements or basic arithmetic, were considered to be numbers at all – even negative numbers were treated with skepticism – so the square root of a negative number was previously considered undefined or nonsensical. The name &quot;imaginary&quot; is generally credited to René Descartes, and Isaac Newton used the term as early as 1670. The notation was introduced by Leonhard Euler.

A &quot;unit&quot; is an undivided whole, and &quot;unity&quot; or the &quot;unit number&quot; is the number one ().

==Definition==
The imaginary unit is defined solely by the property that its square is −1:
formula_3

With defined this way, it follows directly from algebra that and are both square roots of −1.

Although the construction is called &quot;imaginary&quot;, and although the concept of an imaginary number may be intuitively more difficult to grasp than that of a real number, the construction is valid from a mathematical standpoint. Real number operations can be extended to imaginary and complex numbers, by treating as an unknown quantity while manipulating an expression (and using the definition to replace any occurrence of with ). Higher integral powers of are thus
formula_4
and so on, cycling through the four values , , , and . As with any non-zero real number, 

As a complex number, can be represented in rectangular form as , with a zero real component and a unit imaginary component. In polar form, can be represented as (or just ), with an absolute value (or magnitude) of 1 and an argument (or angle) of formula_5 radians. (Adding any integer multiple of to this angle works as well.) In the complex plane, which is a special interpretation of a Cartesian plane, is the point located one unit from the origin along the imaginary axis (which is perpendicular to the real axis).

=== vs. ===

Being a quadratic polynomial with no multiple root, the defining equation has distinct solutions, which are equally valid and which happen to be additive and multiplicative inverses of each other. Although the two solutions are distinct numbers, their properties are indistinguishable; there is no property that one has that the other does not. One of these two solutions is labelled (or simply ) and the other is labelled , though it is inherently ambiguous which is which.

The only differences between and arise from this labelling. For example, by convention is said to have an argument of formula_6 and is said to have an argument of formula_7 related to the convention of labelling orientations in the Cartesian plane relative to the positive -axis with positive angles turning anticlockwise in the direction of the positive -axis. Also, despite the signs written with them, neither nor is inherently positive or negative in the sense that real numbers are.

A more formal expression of this indistinguishability of and is that, although the complex field is unique (as an extension of the real numbers) up to isomorphism, it is unique up to a isomorphism. That is, there are two field automorphisms of the complex numbers formula_8 that keep each real number fixed, namely the identity and complex conjugation. For more on this general phenomenon, see Galois group.

===Matrices===
Using the concepts of matrices and matrix multiplication, complex numbers can be represented in linear algebra. The real unit and imaginary unit can be represented by any pair of matrices and satisfying and Then a complex number can be represented by the matrix and all of the ordinary rules of complex arithmetic can be derived from the rules of matrix arithmetic.

The most common choice is to represent and by the identity matrix and the matrix ,

formula_9

Then an arbitrary complex number can be represented by:

formula_10

More generally, any real-valued matrix with a trace of zero and a determinant of one squares to , so could be chosen for . Larger matrices could also be used; for example, could be represented by the identity matrix and could be represented by any of the Dirac matrices for spatial dimensions.

===Root of ===
Polynomials (weighted sums of the powers of a variable) are a basic tool in algebra. Polynomials whose coefficients are real numbers form a ring, denoted formula_11 an algebraic structure with addition and multiplication and sharing many properties with the ring of integers.

The polynomial formula_12 has no real-number roots, but the set of all real-coefficient polynomials divisible by formula_12 forms an ideal, and so there is a quotient ring formula_14 This quotient ring is isomorphic to the complex numbers, and the variable formula_15 expresses the imaginary unit.

=== Graphic representation ===

The complex numbers can be represented graphically by drawing the real number line as the horizontal axis and the imaginary numbers as the vertical axis of a Cartesian plane called the &quot;complex plane&quot;. In this representation, the numbers and are at the same distance from , with a right angle between them. Addition by a complex number corresponds to translation in the plane, while multiplication by a unit-magnitude complex number corresponds to rotation about the origin. Every similarity transformation of the plane can be represented by a complex-linear function formula_16

=== Geometric algebra ===

In the geometric algebra of the Euclidean plane, the geometric product or quotient of two arbitrary vectors is a sum of a scalar (real number) part and a bivector part. (A scalar is a quantity with no orientation, a vector is a quantity oriented like a line, and a bivector is a quantity oriented like a plane.) The square of any vector is a positive scalar, representing its length squared, while the square of any bivector is a negative scalar.

The quotient of a vector with itself is the scalar , and when multiplied by any vector leaves it unchanged (the identity transformation). The quotient of any two perpendicular vectors of the same magnitude, , which when multiplied rotates the divisor a quarter turn into the dividend, , is a unit bivector which squares to , and can thus be taken as a representative of the imaginary unit. Any sum of a scalar and bivector can be multiplied by a vector to scale and rotate it, and the algebra of such sums is isomorphic to the algebra of complex numbers. In this interpretation points, vectors, and sums of scalars and bivectors are all distinct types of geometric objects.

More generally, in the geometric algebra of any higher-dimensional Euclidean space, a unit bivector of any arbitrary planar orientation squares to , so can be taken to represent the imaginary unit .

==Proper use==
The imaginary unit was historically written formula_17 and still is in some modern works. However, great care needs to be taken when manipulating formulas involving radicals. The radical sign notation formula_18 is reserved either for the principal square root function, which is defined for &quot;only&quot; real or for the principal branch of the complex square root function. Attempting to apply the calculation rules of the principal (real) square root function to manipulate the principal branch of the complex square root function can produce false results:
formula_19

Generally, the calculation rules
formula_20
and
formula_21
are guaranteed to be valid only for real, positive values of and .

When or is real but negative, these problems can be avoided by writing and manipulating expressions like formula_22, rather than formula_23. For a more thorough discussion, see the articles Square root and Branch point.

== Properties ==

As a complex number, the imaginary unit follows all of the rules of complex arithmetic.

=== Imaginary integers and imaginary numbers ===

When the imaginary unit is repeatedly added or subtracted, the result is some integer times the imaginary unit, an &quot;imaginary integer&quot;; any such numbers can be added and the result is also an imaginary integer:

formula_24

Thus, the imaginary unit is the generator of a group under addition, specifically an infinite cyclic group.

The imaginary unit can also be multiplied by any arbitrary real number to form an imaginary number. These numbers can be pictured on a number line, the &quot;imaginary axis&quot;, which as part of the complex plane is typically drawn with a vertical orientation, perpendicular to the real axis which is drawn horizontally.

=== Gaussian integers ===

Integer sums of the real unit and the imaginary unit form a square lattice in the complex plane called the Gaussian integers. The sum, difference, or product of Gaussian integers is also a Gaussian integer:

formula_25

=== Quarter-turn rotation ===

When multiplied by the imaginary unit , any arbitrary complex number in the complex plane is rotated by a quarter turn or ) anticlockwise. When multiplied by , any arbitrary complex number is rotated by a quarter turn clockwise. In polar form:

formula_26

In rectangular form,

formula_27

=== Integer powers ===
The powers of repeat in a cycle expressible with the following pattern, where is any integer:

formula_28

Thus, under multiplication, is a generator of a cyclic group of order 4, a discrete subgroup of the continuous circle group of the unit complex numbers under multiplication.

Written as a special case of Euler&#x27;s formula for an integer ,

formula_29

With a careful choice of branch cuts and principal values, this last equation can also apply to arbitrary complex values of , including cases like .

=== Roots ===

Just like all nonzero complex numbers, formula_30 has two distinct square roots which are additive inverses. In polar form, they are
formula_31

In rectangular form, they are&lt;/math&gt; and formula_32. Substituting either of these results into the equation in turn, we will get the corresponding result for . Thus, the square roots of are the numbers formula_33 and formula_34.}}

formula_35

Squaring either expression yields
formula_36
The three cube roots of are

formula_37

For a general positive integer , the -th roots of are, for 
formula_38
The value associated with is the principal -th root of . The set of roots equals the corresponding set of roots of unity rotated by the principal -th root of . These are the vertices of a regular polygon inscribed within the complex unit circle.

=== Exponential and logarithm ===

The complex exponential function relates complex addition in the domain to complex multiplication in the codomain. Real values in the domain represent scaling in the codomain (multiplication by a real scalar) with representing multiplication by , while imaginary values in the domain represent rotation in the codomain (multiplication by a unit complex number) with representing a rotation by radian. The complex exponential is thus a periodic function in the imaginary direction, with period and image at points for all integers , a real multiple of the lattice of imaginary integers.

The complex exponential can be broken into even and odd components, the hyperbolic functions and or the trigonometric functions and :

formula_39

Euler&#x27;s formula decomposes the exponential of an imaginary number representing a rotation:

formula_40

This fact can be used to demonstrate, among other things, the apparently counterintuitive result that formula_41 is a real number.

The quotient with appropriate scaling, can be represented as an infinite partial fraction decomposition as the sum of reciprocal functions translated by imaginary integers:
formula_42

Other functions based on the complex exponential are well-defined with imaginary inputs. For example, a number raised to the power is:
formula_43 

Because the exponential is periodic, its inverse the complex logarithm is a multi-valued function, with each complex number in the domain corresponding to multiple values in the codomain, separated from each-other by any integer multiple of One way of obtaining a single-valued function is to treat the codomain as a cylinder, with complex values separated by any integer multiple of treated as the same value; another is to take the domain to be a Riemann surface consisting of multiple copies of the complex plane stitched together along the negative real axis as a branch cut, with each branch in the domain corresponding to one infinite strip in the codomain. Functions depending on the complex logarithm therefore depend on careful choice of branch to define and evaluate clearly.

For example, if one chooses any branch where formula_44 then when is a positive real number,
formula_45

=== Factorial ===
The factorial of the imaginary unit is most often given in terms of the gamma function evaluated at :

formula_46

The magnitude and argument of this number are:

formula_47

<text>The Arapaho ( ; , ) are a Native American people historically living on the plains of Colorado and Wyoming. They were close allies of the Cheyenne tribe and loosely aligned with the Lakota and Dakota.

By the 1850s, Arapaho bands formed two tribes, namely the Northern Arapaho and Southern Arapaho. Since 1878, the Northern Arapaho have lived with the Eastern Shoshone on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming and are federally recognized as the Northern Arapaho Tribe of the Wind River Reservation. The Southern Arapaho live with the Southern Cheyenne in Oklahoma. Together, their members are enrolled as the federally recognized Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes.

==Names==
It is uncertain where the word &#x27;Arapaho&#x27; came from. Europeans may have derived it from the Pawnee word for &quot;trader&quot;, &quot;iriiraraapuhu&quot;, or it may have been a corruption of a Crow word for &quot;tattoo&quot;, &quot;alapúuxaache&quot;. The Arapaho autonym is or (&quot;our people&quot; or &quot;people of our own kind&quot;). They refer to their tribe as (Arapaho Nation). The Cheyenne called them or (&quot;People of the Sky&quot; or &quot;Cloud People&quot;); the Dakota as (&quot;Blue Cloud Men&quot;), and the Lakota and Nakota referred to them as (&quot;Blue Sky People&quot;).

The Caddo ( or – &quot;pierced nose people&quot;) called them , the Wichita () , and the Comanche , all names signifying &quot;dog-eaters&quot;. The Pawnee, Ute and other tribes also referred to them with names signifying &quot;dog-eaters&quot;.

The Northern Arapaho, who called themselves or (&quot;white sage men&quot;), were known as or (&quot;red willow men&quot;) to the Southern Arapaho, whereas the latter were called by their northern kin or (&quot;Southerners&quot;). The Northern Arapaho were also known as (&quot;blood-soup men&quot;).

The Cheyenne adapted the Arapaho terms and referred to the Northern Arapaho as &quot;Vanohetan&quot; or &quot;Vanohetaneo / Váno&#x27;étaneo&#x27;o&quot; (&quot;Sage (Brush) People&quot;) and to the Southern Arapaho as &quot;Nomsen&#x27;nat&quot; or &quot;Nomsen&#x27;eo&quot; (&quot;Southerners&quot;).

== Historic political and dialect Arapaho divisions and bands ==
The Arapaho recognize five main divisions among their people, each speaking a different dialect and apparently representing as many originally distinct but cognate tribes. Through much of Arapaho history, each tribal nation maintained a separate ethnic identity, although they occasionally came together and acted as political allies.

Each spoke mutually intelligible dialects, which differed from Arapaho proper. Dialectally, the Haa&#x27;ninin, Beesowuunenno&#x27;, and Hinono&#x27;eino were closely related. Arapaho elders claimed that the Hánahawuuena dialect was the most difficult to comprehend of all the dialects.

In his classic ethnographic study, Alfred Kroeber identified these five nations from south to north:

* Nanwacinaha&#x27;ana, Nawathi&#x27;neha (&quot;Toward the South People&quot;) or Nanwuine&#x27;nan / Noowo3iineheeno&#x27; (&quot;Southern People&quot;). Their now-extinct language dialect – Nawathinehena – was the most divergent from the other Arapaho tribes.
* Hánahawuuena (&quot;Rock Men&quot; or &quot;Rock People&quot;), occupying territory adjacent to, but further north of the Nanwacinaha&#x27;ana, spoke the now-extinct Ha&#x27;anahawunena dialect. 
* Hinono&#x27;eino or Hinanae&#x27;inan (&quot;Arapaho proper&quot;) spoke the Arapaho language (Heenetiit).
* Beesowuunenno&#x27;, Baasanwuune&#x27;nan or Bäsawunena (&quot;Big Lodge People&quot; or &quot;Brush-Hut/Shelter People&quot;) resided further north of the Hinono&#x27;eino. Their war parties used temporary brush shelters similar to the dome-shaped shade or Sweat lodge of the Great Lakes Algonquian peoples. They are said to have migrated from their former territory near the Lakes more recently than the other Arapaho tribes. (Note: many people say their name means &quot;Great Lakes People&quot; or &quot;Big Water People&quot;.) They spoke the now-extinct Besawunena (&quot;Beesoowuuyeitiit&quot; – &quot;Big Lodge/Great Lakes language&quot;) dialect. 
* Haa&#x27;ninin, A&#x27;aninin or A&#x27;ani (&quot;White Clay People&quot; or &quot;Lime People&quot;), the northernmost tribal group; they retained a distinct ethnicity and were known to the French as the historic Gros Ventre. In Blackfoot they were called Atsina (&quot;Atsíína&quot; – &quot;like a Cree&quot;, i.e. &quot;enemy&quot;, or &quot;Piik-siik-sii-naa&quot; – &quot;snakes&quot;, i.e. &quot;enemies&quot;). After they separated, the other Arapaho peoples, who considered them inferior, called them Hitúnĕna or Hittiuenina (&quot;Begging Men&quot;, &quot;Beggars&quot;, or more exactly &quot;Spongers&quot;). They speak the nearly extinct Gros Ventre (Ananin, Ahahnelin) language dialect (called by the Arapaho &quot;Hitouuyeitiit&quot; – &quot;Begging Men Language&quot;), there is evidence that the southern Haa&#x27;ninin tribal group, the &quot;Staetan band&quot;, together with bands of the later political division of the Northern Arapaho, spoke the Besawunena dialect.

Before their historic geo-political ethnogenesis, each tribal-nation had a principal
headman. The exact date of the ethnic fusion or fission of each social division is not known. The elders say that the &quot;Hinono&#x27;eino&quot; (&quot;Arapaho proper&quot;) and &quot;Beesowuunenno″&quot; (&quot;Big Lodge People&quot; or &quot;Brush-Hut/Shelter People&quot;) fought over the tribal symbols – the sacred pipe and lance. Both sacred objects traditionally were kept by the &quot;Beesowuunenno″&quot;. The different tribal-nations lived together and the &quot;Beesowuunenno″&quot; have dispersed for at least 150 years among the formerly distinct Arapaho tribal groups.

By the late 18th century, the four divisions south of the &quot;Haa&#x27;ninin&quot; (&quot;White Clay People&quot; or &quot;Lime People&quot;) or &quot;Gros Ventre (Atsina)&quot; consolidated into the Arapaho. Only the Arapaho and Gros Ventre (Atsina) identified as separate tribal-nations.

While living on the Great Plains, the &quot;Hinono&#x27;eino&quot; (all Arapaho bands south of the &quot;Haa&#x27;ninin&quot;) divided historically into two geopolitical social divisions:
* Northern Arapaho or Nank&#x27;haanseine&#x27;nan (&quot;Sagebrush People&quot;), Nookhose&#x27;iinenno (&quot;White Sage People&quot;); are called by the Southern Arapaho Bo&#x27;ooceinenno″ or Baachinena (&quot;red willow men&quot;); the Kiowa know them as &quot;Tägyäko&quot; (&quot;Sagebrush People&quot;), a translation of their proper name. They keep the sacred tribal articles, and are considered the nucleus or mother tribe of the Arapaho, being indicated in the Plains Indian Sign Language (&quot;Bee3sohoet&quot;) by the sign for &quot;mother people&quot;. They absorbed the historic &quot;Hánahawuuena&quot; and &quot;Beesowuunenno″&quot;. An estimated 50 persons of Beesowuunenno&#x27; lineage are included among the Northern Arapaho, and perhaps a few with the other two main divisions.
* Southern Arapaho, Náwunena or Noowunenno″ (&quot;Southern People&quot;), are called by the Northern Arapaho Nawathi&#x27;neha (&quot;Southerners&quot;); the Kiowa know them as &quot;Ähayädal&quot;, the (plural) name for the wild plum. The sign for the Southern Arapaho is made by rubbing the index finger against the side of the nose. They absorbed the historic &quot;Nanwuine&#x27;nan / Noowo3iineheeno&quot; (&quot;Southern People&quot;) and some &quot;Beesowuunenno″&quot;.

=== Language ===

The Arapaho language is currently spoken in two different dialects, and it is considered to be a member of the Algonquian language family. The number of fluent speakers of Northern Arapaho has dwindled to 250, most living on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, while the number of Southern Arapaho speakers is even more scarce, with only a handful of people who speak it, all advanced in age.

According to Cowell &amp; Moss&#x27;s 2008 study of the Arapaho language, the Northern Arapaho have made a great effort to maintain the language through establishing the Language and Culture Commission. By producing audio and visual materials, they have provided ways for younger generations to learn the language. In 1995 this effort was matched by Dr. S. N. Greymorning, who established an Arapaho language immersion preschool program. Arapaho language instruction is also offered all throughout grade school. However, the number of students that take the subject is wavering and those who learn typically only retain a selection of memorized vocabulary. There is widespread interest in keeping the language alive for the Northern Arapaho, and their outlook remains positive in their endeavors to perpetuate the learning of Arapaho in schools and among their children and young people. However, this attitude is often counteracted by the lack of true commitment and willingness to really learn and become fluent, underscored by a misunderstanding of its deep roots and purpose.

For Southern Arapaho, the language is not quite as valued as it is on the Wind River Reservation. Most have lost interest in learning or maintaining it, and until recently, there were little to no efforts to preserve their dialect. There is a small number who have begun online courses conducted via video in an attempt to revitalize a desire to learn it, and popularity has increased over the past few years.

==Histories==

===Early history===

Around 3,000 years ago, the ancestral Arapaho-speaking people (&quot;Heeteinono&#x27;eino″&quot;) lived in the western Great Lakes region along the Red River Valley in what is classified as present-day Manitoba, Canada and Minnesota, United States. There the Arapaho were an agricultural people who grew crops, including maize. Following European colonization in eastern Canada, together with the early Cheyenne people (&quot;Hitesiino&quot;&#x27;), the Arapaho were forced to migrate westward onto the eastern Great Plains by the Ojibwe. They were numerous and powerful, having obtained guns from their French trading allies.

The ancestors of the Arapaho people entered the Great Plains from the western Great Lakes region sometime before 1700. During their early history on the plains, the Arapaho lived on the northern plains from the South Saskatchewan River in Canada south to Montana, Wyoming, and western South Dakota. Before the Arapaho acquired horses, they used domestic dogs as pack animals to pull their travois. The Arapaho acquired horses in the early 1700s from other tribes, which changed their way of life. They became nomadic people, using the horses as pack and riding animals. They could transport greater loads, and travel more easily by horseback to hunt more easily and widely, increasing their success in hunting on the Plains.

Gradually, the Arapaho moved farther south, split into the closely allied Northern and Southern Arapaho, and established a large joint territory spanning land in southern Montana, most of Wyoming, the Nebraska Panhandle, central and eastern Colorado, western Oklahoma, and extreme western Kansas. A large group of Arapaho split from the main tribe and became an independent people, commonly known as the Gros Ventre (as named by the French) or Atsina. The name Gros Ventre, meaning &quot;Big Bellies&quot; in French, was a misinterpretation of sign language between an Indian guide and French explorers. The Gros Ventre spoke an Algonquian language similar to Arapaho after the division; they identified as &quot;A&#x27;aninin&quot;, meaning ″White Clay people″. The Arapaho often viewed the Gros Ventre as inferior and referred to them as &quot;Hitúnĕna&quot; or &quot;Hitouuteen&quot;, meaning &quot;beggars&quot;. 

===Expansion on the plains===
Once established, the Arapaho began to expand on the plains through trade, warfare, and alliances with other plains tribes. Around 1811, the Arapaho made an alliance with the Cheyenne (&quot;Hítesíínoʼ&quot; – &#x27;scarred one&#x27;). Their strong alliance with the Cheyenne allowed the Arapaho to greatly expand their hunting territory. By 1826, the Lakota, Dakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho pushed the Kiowa (&quot;Niiciiheihiinennoʼ&quot;; Kiowa tribe: &quot;Niiciiheihiiteen&quot;) and invading Comanche to the south. Conflict with the allied Comanche and Kiowa ended in 1840 when the two large tribes made peace with the Arapaho and Southern Cheyenne and became their allies.

Chief Little Raven was the most notable Arapaho chief; he helped mediate peace among the nomadic southern plains tribes and would retain his reputation as a peace chief throughout the Indian Wars and reservation period. The alliance with the Comanche and Kiowa made the most southern Arapaho bands powerful enough to enter the Llano Estacado in the Texas Panhandle. One band of Southern Arapaho became so closely allied with the Comanche that they were absorbed into the tribe, adopted the Comanche language, and became a band of Comanche known as the &quot;Saria Tʉhka (Sata Teichas)&quot; &#x27;dog-eaters&#x27;.

Along the upper Missouri River, the Arapaho actively traded with the farming villages of the Arikara, Mandan, and Hidatsa, trading meat and hides for corn, squash, and beans. The Arikara referred to the Arapaho as the &quot;Colored Stone Village (People)&quot;, possibly because gemstones from the Southwest were among the trade items. The Hidatsa called them &quot;E-tah-leh&quot; or &quot;Ita-Iddi&quot; (&#x27;buffalo-path people&#x27;), referring to their hunting of bison.

Conflict with Euro-American traders and explorers was limited at the time. The Arapaho freely entered various trading posts and trade fairs to exchange mostly bison hides and beaver furs for European goods such as firearms. The Arapaho frequently encountered fur traders in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, and the headwaters of the Platte and Arkansas. They became well-known traders on the plains and bordering Rocky Mountains. The name &quot;Arapaho&quot; may have been derived from the Pawnee word &quot;Tirapihu&quot; (or &quot;Larapihu&quot;), meaning &quot;he buys or trades&quot; or &quot;traders&quot;. The Arapaho were a prominent trading group in the Great Plains region. The term may also have come from European-American traders referring to them by their Crow (Apsáalooke aliláau) name of &quot;Alappahoʼ&quot;, which meant &#x27;people with many tattoos&#x27;. By custom the Arapaho tattooed small circles on their bodies. The name Arapaho became widespread among the white traders.

===Enemies and warrior culture===
A large part of Arapaho society was based around the warrior. Most young men sought this role. After adopting use of the horse, the Arapaho quickly became master horsemen and highly skilled at fighting on horseback. Warriors had larger roles than combat in the society. They were expected to keep peace among the camps, provide food and wealth for their families, and guard the camps from attacks.

Like other plains Indians, including their Cheyenne allies, the Arapaho have a number of distinct military societies. Each of the eight Arapaho military societies had their own unique initiation rites, pre- and post- battle ceremonies and songs, regalia, and style of combat. Unlike their Cheyenne, Lakota, and Dakota allies, the Arapaho military societies were age based. Each age level had its own society for prestigious or promising warriors of the matching age. As the warriors aged, they may graduate to the next society.

Warriors often painted their face and bodies with war paint, as well as their horses, for spiritual empowerment. Each warrior created a unique design for the war paint which they often wore into battle. Feathers from birds, particularly eagle feathers, were also worn in battle as symbols of prestige and for reasons similar to war paint. Before setting out for war, the warriors organized into war parties. War parties were made up of individual warriors and a selected war chief. The title of war chief must be earned through a specific number of acts of bravery in battle known as counting coup. Coups may include stealing horses while undetected, touching a living enemy, or stealing a gun from an enemy&#x27;s grasp. Arapaho warriors used a variety of weapons, including war-clubs, lances, knives, tomahawks, bows, shotguns, rifles, and pistols. They acquired guns through trade at trading posts or trade fairs, in addition to raiding soldiers or other tribes.

The Arapaho fought with the Pawnee (&quot;Hooxeihiinenno″&quot; – &quot;wolf people&quot;), Omaha (&quot;Howohoono″&quot;), Ho-chunk, Osage (&quot;Wosootiinen&quot;, &quot;Wosoo3iinen&quot; or &quot;Wosoosiinen&quot;), Ponca (same as Omaha: &quot;Howohoono″&quot;), and Kaw (&quot;Honoho″&quot;) east of their territory. North of Arapaho territory they fought with the Crow (&quot;Houunenno″&quot;), Blackfoot Confederacy (&quot;Woo&#x27;teenixteet&quot; or &quot;Woo&#x27;teenixtee3i&quot;&#x27; – ″people wearing black-feet″), Gros Ventre (&quot;Hitouunenno″&quot;, Gros Ventre tribe: &quot;Hitouuteen&quot;), Flathead (&quot;Kookee&#x27;ei3i″&quot;), Arikara (&quot;Koonoonii3i″&quot; – ″people whose jaws break in pieces″), Iron Confederacy (Nehiyaw-Pwat) (Assiniboine (&quot;Nihooneihteenootineihino″&quot; - &quot;yellow-footed Sioux&quot;), Plains/Woods Cree (&quot;Nooku(h)nenno″&quot;; Plains Cree tribe: &quot;Nookuho″&quot; - &quot;rabbit people&quot;), Saulteaux (Plains Ojibwa) and Nakoda (Stoney)). To the west they fought with eastern Shoshone (&quot;Sosoni&#x27;ii&quot;; Shoshone tribe: &quot;Sosoni&#x27;iiteen&quot;) and the Ute (&quot;Wo&#x27;(o)teenehi3i″&quot; - ″cut throats″; Ute tribe: &quot;Wo&#x27;(o)teennehhiiteen&quot;). South of their territory they occasionally fought with the Navajo (&quot;Coohoh&#x27;oukutoo3i″&quot; – ″those who tie their hair in back of the head or in bunches″), Apache (&quot;Coo3o″&quot; – &quot;enemy&quot; or &quot;Teebe&#x27;eisi3i″&quot; – &quot;they have their hair cut straight, hanging straight down&quot;, &quot;Ti&#x27;iihiinen&quot; – &quot;killdeer people&quot; refers especially to Jicarilla Apache) and various Pueblo peoples (&quot;Cooh&#x27;ookutoo3i″&quot; – &quot;they tie their hair in a bundle&quot;).

The Cheyenne (&quot;Hitesiino″&quot;), Sioux (&quot;Nootineihino″&quot;), Kiowa (&quot;Niiciiheihiinenno″&quot; – ″river people″ or &quot;Koh&#x27;ówuunénno&quot;&#x27; – ″creek people″; Kiowa tribe: &quot;Niiciiheihiiteen&quot; or &quot;Koh&#x27;ówuunteen&quot;), Plains Apache (&quot;3oxooheinen&quot; – &quot;pounder people&quot;), and Comanche (&quot;Coo3o″&quot; – sg. and pl., means: &quot;enemy&quot;, like Apache) were enemies of the Arapaho initially but became their allies. Together with their allies, the Arapaho also fought with invading US soldiers, miners, and settlers across Arapaho territory and the territory of their allies.

===Sand Creek Massacre===

==== Events Leading to the Sand Creek Massacre ====
Several skirmishes had ignited hatred from white settlers that lived in the area, and left Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes in constant fear of being attacked by American troops. For example, on April 12, 1864, a rancher brought troops to attack a group of 15 warriors who had asked to be rewarded for bringing his mules back to him. The warriors acted in self-defense and sent the troops running. Word got back to Colonel John Chivington, and they had told him the Indians shot first. He also heard there were 175 cattle head stolen from the government. Chivington &quot;ordered troops to find and &#x27;chastise&#x27; the &#x27;Indians&#x27;.&quot; Soldiers burned villages and sought out to kill Indians, the violence escalating months before the Sand Creek Massacre.

In an effort to establish peace, John Evans attempted to extend an offer of refuge and protection to &quot;friendly&quot; Indians. However, these efforts were trampled by General Curtis&#x27; military expedition against tribes between the Platte and Arkansas Rivers. By this point, both Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes thought that an all out war of extermination was about to rage against them, so they quickly fled, and Curtis and his men never met them.

==== Sand Creek Massacre ====

In November 1864, the Colorado militia, led by Colonel John Chivington, massacred a small village of Cheyenne and Arapaho in the Sand Creek massacre. According to a historical narrative on the event titled &quot;Chief Left Hand&quot;, by Margaret Coel, there were several events that led to the Colorado militia&#x27;s attack on the village. Governor Evans desired to hold title to the resource-rich Denver-Boulder area. The government trust officials avoided Chief Left Hand, a linguistically gifted Southern Arapaho chief, when executing their treaty that transferred the title of the area away from Indian Trust. The local cavalry was stretched thin by the demands of the Civil War while Indian warriors, acting independently of Chief Left Hand, raided their supply lines. A group of Arapaho and Cheyenne elders with women and children had been denied their traditional wintering grounds in Boulder by the cavalry and were ordered to come to Fort Lyon for food and protection or be considered hostile.

On arrival at Lyon, Chief Left Hand and his followers were accused of violence by Colonel Chivington. Chief Left Hand and his people got the message that only those Indians that reported to Fort Lyon would be considered peaceful and all others would be considered hostile and ordered killed. Confused, Chief Left Hand and his followers turned away and traveled a safe distance away from the fort to camp. A traitor gave Colonel Chivington directions to the camp. He and his battalion stalked and attacked the camp early the next morning. Rather than heroic, Colonel Chivington&#x27;s efforts were considered a gross embarrassment to the Cavalry since he attacked peaceful elders, women, and children. As a result of his war efforts, instead of receiving the promotion to which he aspired, he was relieved of his duties.

On October 14, 1865, almost a year after the Sand Creek Massacre, The Arapaho and Cheyenne signed a new treaty with the US government. The treaty addressed the future of conflict between the two tribes and the US government, it outlined new boundaries, it forced the tribe to relinquish claims to other lands, amongst many other demands. The treaty, spanning nine articles, was ratified on May 22, 1866, and then later proclaimed on February 2, 1867.

Eugene Ridgely, a Cheyenne–Northern Arapaho artist, is credited with bringing to light the fact that Arapahos were among the victims of the massacre. His children, Gail Ridgely, Benjamin Ridgley, and Eugene &quot;Snowball&quot; Ridgely, were instrumental in having the massacre site designated as a National Historic Site. In 1999, Benjamin and Gail Ridgley organized a group of Northern Arapaho runners to run from Limon, Colorado, to Ethete, Wyoming, in memory of their ancestors who were forced to run for their lives after being attacked and pursued by Colonel Chivington and his battalion. Their efforts will be recognized and remembered by the &quot;Sand Creek Massacre&quot; signs that appear along the roadways from Limon to Casper, Wyoming, and then to Ethete.

==== Why the Sand Creek Massacre Occurred ====
The violence that ensued was deeply rooted in the Indian-hating by American settlers in the area. Their perception was that &quot;their nascent settlements were indeed surrounded by Indians&quot;, and their inexperience in dealing with Indians was what sparked the Sand Creek Massacre.

===Indian Wars on the Southern Plains===

The events at Sand Creek sparked outrage among the Arapaho and Cheyenne, resulting in three decades of war between them and the United States. Much of the hostilities took place in Colorado, leading to many of the events being referred to as part of the so-called Colorado War. Battles and hostilities elsewhere on the southern plains such as in Kansas and Texas are often included as part of the &quot;Comanche Wars&quot;. During the wars, the Arapaho and Cheyenne allies—the Kiowa, Comanche, and Plains Apache—would participate in some battles alongside them. The Lakota from the north came down into northern Colorado to help the Arapaho and Cheyenne there. The Battle of Julesburg resulted from a force of about 1,000 allied Northern Arapaho, Cheyenne (mostly from the Dog Soldiers warrior society), and Lakota from the Brulé and Oglala sub-tribes. The point of the raid was retaliation for the events at the Sand Creek Massacre months earlier. The allied Indian forces attacked settlers and US Army forces around the valley of the South Platte River near Julesburg, Colorado. The battle was a decisive Indian victory, resulting in 14 soldiers and four civilians dead and probably no Indian casualties. A force of around 3,000 Southern Arapaho, Northern Cheyenne, and Lakota attacked soldiers and civilians at a bridge crossing the North Platte River, known as the Battle of Platte Bridge. The battle was another victory for the Indians, with 29 soldiers killed and at least eight Indian casualties. Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche, Kiowa, and Plains Apaches seeking peace were offered to sign the Medicine Lodge Treaty in October 1867. The treaty allotted the Southern Arapaho a reservation with the Southern Cheyenne between the Arkansas and Cimarron rivers in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Among those that signed the treaty was Chief Little Raven. Those that did not sign the treaty were called &quot;hostile&quot; and were continually pursued by the US Army and their Indian scouts. The last major battle between the Arapaho and the US on the southern plains was the Battle of Summit Springs in northernmost Colorado. The battle involved a force of around 450 Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Lakota warriors and 244 US soldiers and around 50 Pawnee scouts under Frank North. The most prominent Indian leader at the battle was Tall Bull, a leader of the Dog Soldiers warrior society of the Cheyenne. The battle was a US victory with around 35 warriors killed (including Tall Bull) and a further 17 captured. The soldiers suffered only a single casualty. The death of Tall Bull was a major loss for the Dog Soldiers.

===Powder River Expedition===

After the Sand Creek Massacre and a number of other skirmishes, the Northern Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Lakota moved many of their bands to the remote Powder River country in Wyoming and southern Montana. Along the way, they participated in the Battle of Mud Springs, a minor incident in the Nebraska Panhandle involving a force of between 500 and 1,000 Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Lakota warriors and 230 US soldiers. The battle resulted in the capture of some army horses and a herd of several hundred cattle with a single US casualty. An attempt was made by the army to recapture their stolen livestock and attack the Indians, which resulted in the Battle of Rush Creek. The battle was inconclusive, resulting in only one Indian casualty and three US soldiers dead (with a further eight wounded). Lt. Col. William O. Collins, commander of the army forces, stated that pursuing the Indian forces any further through the dry Sand Hills area would be &quot;injudicious and useless&quot;. Once in the area of the Powder River, the Arapaho noticed an increase in travelers moving along the established Bozeman trail, which led to the Montana goldfields. Settlers and miners traveling on the Bozeman Trail through the Powder River country were viewed as threats by the Indians as they were numerous and were often violent towards encountered Indians and competed for food along the trail.

Hostilities in the Powder River area led Major General Grenville M. Dodge to order the Powder River Expedition as a punitive campaign against the Arapaho, Lakota, and Cheyenne. The expedition was inconclusive with neither side gaining a definitive victory. The allied Indian forces mostly evaded the soldiers except for raids on their supplies which left most soldiers desperately under-equipped. The most significant battle was the Battle of the Tongue River where Brigadier General Patrick Edward Connor ordered Frank North and his Pawnee Scouts to find a camp of Arapaho Indians under the leadership of Chief Black Bear. Once located, Connor sent in 200 soldiers with two howitzers and 40 Omaha and Winnebago and 30 Pawnee scouts, and marched toward the village that night. Indian warriors acting as scouts for the US Army came from the Pawnee, Omaha, and Winnebago tribes who were traditional enemies of the Arapaho and their Cheyenne and Lakota allies. With mountain man Jim Bridger leading the forces, they charged the camp. Most of the Arapaho warriors were gone on a raid against the Crow, and the battle was a US victory resulting in 63 Arapaho dead, mostly women and children. The few warriors present at the camp put up a strong defense and covered the women and children as most escaped beyond the reach of the soldiers and Indian scouts. After the battle, the soldiers burned and looted the abandoned tipis. Connor singled out four Winnebago, including chief Little Priest, plus North and 15 Pawnee for bravery. The Pawnee made off with 500 horses from the camp&#x27;s herd as payback for previous raids by the Arapaho. The Arapaho were not intimidated by the attack and launched a counterattack resulting in the Sawyers Fight where Arapaho warriors attacked a group of surveyors, resulting in three dead and no Arapaho losses.

===Red Cloud&#x27;s War===
Red Cloud&#x27;s War was a war fought between soldiers of the United States and the allied Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Northern Arapaho from 1866 to 1868. The war was named after the prominent Oglala Lakota chief Red Cloud who led many followers into battle with the invading soldiers. The war was a response to the large number of miners and settlers passing through the Bozeman Trail, which was the fastest and easiest trail from Fort Laramie to the Montana goldfields. The Bozeman Trail passed right through the Powder River Country which was near the center of Arapaho, Cheyenne, Lakota, and Dakota territory in Wyoming and southern Montana. The large number of miners and settlers competed directly with the Indians for resources such as food along the trail.

The most significant battle during Red Cloud&#x27;s War was the Fetterman Fight, also known as Battle of The Hundred in the Hand to the Indian forces fought on December 21, 1866. The Battle involved Capt. William J. Fetterman who led a force of 79 soldiers and two civilians after a group of 10 Indian decoys planning on luring Fetterman&#x27;s forces into an ambush. The 10 decoys consisted of two Arapaho, two Cheyenne, and six Lakota. Fetterman was well known for his boastful nature and his inexperience fighting Indian warriors and despite orders to not pursue the decoys did so anyway. Jim Bridger, famous Mountain Man and guide to the soldiers stationed at Fort Laramie, commented on how the soldiers &quot;don&#x27;t know anything about fighting Indians&quot;. After about a half-mile pursuit, the decoys signaled the hidden warriors to ambush Fetterman and his forces. Warriors from both sides of the trail charged Fetterman and forced them into nearby rocks where the battle soon became hand-to-hand combat, giving the Indians the upper hand due to their skill in fighting with handheld weapons such as tomahawks and war clubs. The Indian forces killed all of Fetterman&#x27;s infantry, as well as the following cavalry, with a total of 81 killed. The battle was the greatest military defeat by the US on the Great Plains until the Battle of the Little Bighorn 10 years later. Red Cloud&#x27;s War ended in a victory for the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Lakota, and Dakota. The Treaty of Fort Laramie guaranteed legal control of the Powder River country to the Indians.

===Great Sioux War of 1876–77===
The Great Sioux War of 1876–77, also known as the Black Hills War or Great Cheyenne War, was a major conflict that was fought between the Lakota Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho alliance and the US Army. The war was started after miners and settlers traveled into the Black Hills area and found gold, resulting in increased numbers of non-Indians illegally entering designated Indian lands. A large part of Cheyenne and Arapaho territory and most of Sioux territory known as the Great Sioux Reservation was guaranteed legally to the tribes by the Treaty of Fort Laramie after they defeated the US during Red Cloud&#x27;s War in 1868. The Black Hills in particular are viewed as sacred to the Lakota and Dakota peoples, and the presence of settlers illegally occupying the area caused great unrest within the tribes. Instead of evicting the settlers, the US Army broke the treaty and invaded Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho territory in order to protect American settlers and put the allied tribes on smaller reservations or wiped them out.

After Red Cloud&#x27;s War, many Northern Arapaho moved to the Red Cloud Agency in Dakota Territory and lived among the Lakota, as well as many Cheyenne. Among the most influential and respected Arapaho chiefs living on the Agency was Chief Black Coal (Northern Arapaho), who gained prominence as a warrior and leader against white settlers in the Powder River country. Other important Arapaho chiefs living in the area included Medicine Man, Chief Black Bear, Sorrel Horse, Little Shield, Sharp Nose, Little Wolf, Plenty Bear, and Friday. The Arapaho chief Friday was well regarded for his intelligence and served as an interpreter between the tribe and the Americans. Black Coal guaranteed to the Americans that he and his people would remain peaceful during the tense times when the settlers were illegally entering Indian land in hopes of securing recognized territory of their own in Wyoming. Many of the warriors and families that disagreed with Black Coal&#x27;s ideals drifted southward to join up with the southern division of Arapahos. Many Arapaho, particularly those in Chief Medicine Man&#x27;s band, did not wish to reside among the Sioux &quot;for fear of mixing themselves up with other tribes&quot;. Their peaceful stance and willingness to help American soldiers strained once strong relations between them and the Lakota and Cheyenne, who took an aggressive stance and fled the reservation. Attitudes towards the Arapaho from the &quot;hostile&quot; Lakota and Cheyenne were similar to the attitudes they had towards members of their own tribes which took similar peaceful stances and remained as &quot;reservation Indians&quot;. Despite their unwillingness to take up the warpath, the Arapaho were unwilling to cede their territory, particularly the Black Hills area to which they have a strong spiritual attachment similar to the Lakota.
 
During this time of great unrest, the tribe found itself deteriorating in leadership with many chiefs holding little sway among their bands. In order to regain strength as leaders and further negotiations for land in Wyoming, many chiefs and their warriors enlisted as army scouts for the United States and campaigned against their allies. Chief Sharp Nose, who was considered as influential and equal to Black Coal, was noted as &quot;the inspiration of the battlefield  ... He handled men with rare judgment and coolness, and was as modest as he was brave&quot;. Despite their overall stance as allies for the Americans, a handful of Arapaho warriors fought against the United States in key battles during the war.

Like in previous wars, the US recruited Indian warriors from tribes that were enemies with the Arapaho–Cheyenne–Lakota–Dakota alliance to act as Indian scouts, most notably from the Crow, Arikara, and Shoshone. Unlike previous conflicts involving the Lakota–Dakota–Cheyenne–Arapaho alliance and the United States, the Great Sioux War ended in a victory for the United States. The bison herds which were the center of life for the Indians were considerably smaller due to government-supported whole-scale slaughter in order to prevent collisions with railroads, conflict with ranch cattle, and to force nomadic plains Indians to adopt reservation life living off government handouts. Decreased resources and starvation was the major reason for the surrendering of individual Indian bands and the end of the Great Sioux War.


The most significant battle of the war was the Battle of The Little Bighorn on June 25–26, 1876. The battle was fought between warriors from the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho (as well as individual Dakota warriors) and the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the US Army. The battle was fought along the Little Bighorn River in eastern Montana. The soldiers attempted to ambush the large camp of Indians along the river bottom despite the warnings from the Crow Scouts who knew that Custer severely underestimated the number of warriors in the camp. The US Seventh Cavalry, including the Custer Battalion, a force of 700 men led by George Armstrong Custer, suffered a severe defeat. Five of the Seventh Cavalry&#x27;s companies were annihilated. The total US casualty count, including scouts, was 268 dead including Custer and 55 injured. Only five Arapaho were present at the battle and their presence was by chance. The Arapaho present were four Northern Arapaho warriors named Yellow Eagle, Yellow Fly, Left Hand, and Water Man. The fifth Arapaho was a Southern Arapaho named Well-Knowing One (Sage) but also known as Green Grass. The five Arapaho set out as a war party from near Fort Robinson to raid the Shoshone, but by chance came across a small party of young Sioux warriors. The Sioux thought that the Arapaho were United States Army Indian Scouts and invited them back to their camp along the Little Bighorn River, where they were captured and had their guns taken from them. The Lakota and Dakota threatened to kill the Arapaho, but the Cheyenne chief Two Moons recognized the men as Arapaho and ordered their release. The next day was the battle and, despite being viewed with suspicion, the five Arapaho actively fought in the battle. Water Man wore a large eagle feather headdress, a white shirt, beaded leggings, a breechcloth, and painted his face red and yellow during the battle. Water Man claimed killing one soldier while charging up the steep river banks but did not take his scalp because most Arapaho refused to take a scalp from someone with short hair. Water Man claimed to have watched Custer die.

The Arapaho warrior Left Hand accidentally killed a Lakota warrior that he mistook for an Arikara scout, and despite further anger from the Lakota, left the battle alive along with the other four Arapaho. After the battle, the five Arapaho quietly slipped away and headed back to the Fort Robinson area.

==Culture==

===Creation myth===
The creation myth of the Arapaho people shows a connection with the Algonquian people. Both cultures have an &quot;earth-diver creation myth&quot;. The Arapaho myth begins with a being called Flat Pipe who exists alone upon the water. The Great Spirit suggests to Flat Pipe that he create creatures to build a world. He first conceives of ducks and other water birds who dive beneath the surface of the water but are not able to find land. With guidance from the Great Spirit, Flat Pipe creates a turtle who can live on both land or in the water. The Turtle dives and returns, spitting out a piece of land that grows into the earth. Flat Pipe then goes about creating men, women, and animals to populate the earth. The turtle is common to many &quot;earth-diver&quot; creation myths.

This myth is an example of &quot;creation by thought&quot;. Flat Pipe creates the creatures by thinking of them.

===Gender and division of labor===

Traditionally, men are responsible for hunting. After horses were introduced, buffalo became the main food source—the meat, organs, and the blood all being consumed. Blood was drunk or made into pudding. Women (and &quot;haxu&#x27;xan&quot; (Two Spirits)) are traditionally in charge of food preparation and dressing hides to make clothing and bedding, saddles, and housing materials.

The Arapaho have historically had social and spiritual roles for those who are known in contemporary Native cultures as Two Spirit or third gender. Anthropologist Alfred Kroeber wrote about male-bodied individuals who lived as women, the &quot;haxu&#x27;xan&quot;, who he says were believed to have &quot;the natural desire to become women, and as they grew up gradually became women&quot; (and could marry men); he further stated that the Arapaho believed that the &quot;haxu&#x27;xan&quot;&#x27;s gender was a supernatural gift from birds or other animals, that they had miraculous powers, and they were also noted for their inventiveness, such as making the first intoxicant from rainwater.

===Clothing===
On the Plains, women (and &quot;haxu&#x27;xan&quot;) historically wore moccasins, leggings, and ankle-length buckskin-fringed dresses, ornamented with porcupine quills, paint, elk teeth, and beads. Men have also worn moccasins, leggings, buckskin breechclothes (drawn between the legs, tied around the waist), and sometimes shirts; warriors have often worn necklaces. Many of these items are still part of contemporary dress for both casual and formal wear, or as regalia.

==Economic development==

In July 2005, Northern Arapahos won a contentious court battle with the State of Wyoming to get into the gambling or casino industry. The 10th Circuit Court ruled that the State of Wyoming was acting in bad faith when it would not negotiate with the Arapahos for gaming. The Northern Arapaho Tribe opened the first casinos in Wyoming. Presently, the Arapaho Tribe owns and operates high-stakes, Class III gaming at the Wind River Casino, the Little Wind Casino, and the 789 Smoke Shop and Casino. In 2012, The Wind River Hotel, which is attached to the Wind River Casino, features a cultural room called the Northern Arapaho Experience. They are regulated by a Gaming Commission composed of three tribal members.

Meanwhile, the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes operate four casinos in Oklahoma: the Lucky Star Casino in Clinton, the Lucky Star Casino in Watonga, the Feather Warrior Casino in Canton, and the newest casino which opened in 2018, the Lucky Star Casino in Hammon.

== Population history ==
There are no references to the numbers of the Arapaho previous to the 19th century. M. R. Stuart in 1812 estimated the Arapaho at 3,050 warriors (therefore around 15,250 people). Jedidiah Morse in 1822 reported 10,000 Arrapahays, 7,000 Kaninavisch (another name for the Arapaho), 1,500 Castahana and 1,500 Pastanownas (possibly related tribes). Indian Affairs gave the Arapaho at 3,045 people in year 1880, 2,298 in year 1885, 1,925 in 1890, 1,869 in 1895, 1,782 in 1900, 1,768 in 1905 and 1,753 in 1910.

During the 20th and 21st centuries Arapaho population has rebounded and they numbered 12,192 in 2020.

<text>The Lincoln Memorial is a U.S. national memorial honoring Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, located on the western end of the National Mall of Washington, D.C. The memorial is built in a neoclassical style and forms a classical temple. The memorial&#x27;s architect was Henry Bacon. In 1920, Daniel Chester French designed the large interior &quot;Statue of Abraham Lincoln&quot;, which was carved in marble by the Piccirilli brothers. Jules Guerin painted the interior murals, and the epitaph above the statue was written by Royal Cortissoz. Dedicated on May 30, 1922, it is one of several memorials built to honor an American president. It has been a major tourist attraction since its opening, and over the years, has occasionally been used as a symbolic center focused on race relations and civil rights.

Doric style columns line the temple exterior, and the inscriptions inside include two well-known speeches by Lincoln, the Gettysburg Address and his second inaugural address. The memorial has been the site of many famous speeches, including Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech delivered on August 28, 1963, during the rally at the end of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

Like other monuments on the National Mall, including the nearby Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Korean War Veterans Memorial, and World War II Memorial, the national memorial is administered by the National Park Service under its National Mall and Memorial Parks group. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since October 15, 1966, and was ranked seventh on the American Institute of Architects&#x27; 2007 list of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture. The memorial is open to the public 24 hours a day, and more than seven million people visit it annually.

==History==
===Construction and dedication=== 

The first public memorial to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., was a statue by Lot Flannery erected in front of the District of Columbia City Hall in 1868, three years after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination in Ford’s Theatre. Demands for a fitting national memorial had been voiced since the time of Lincoln&#x27;s death. In 1867, Congress passed the first of many bills incorporating a commission to erect a monument for the sixteenth president. An American sculptor, Clark Mills, was chosen to design the monument. His plans reflected the nationalistic spirit of the time and called for a structure adorned with six equestrian and 31 pedestrian statues of colossal proportions, crowned by a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Subscriptions for the project were insufficient.

The matter lay dormant until the start of the 20th century, when, under the leadership of Senator Shelby M. Cullom of Illinois, six separate bills were introduced in Congress for the incorporation of a new memorial commission. The first five bills, proposed in the years 1901, 1902, and 1908, met with defeat because of opposition from Speaker Joe Cannon. The sixth bill (Senate Bill 9449), introduced on December 13, 1910, passed. The Lincoln Memorial Commission met for the first time the following year and President William H. Taft was chosen as the commission&#x27;s president. Progress continued steadily, and in 1913 Congress approved the commission&#x27;s choice of design and location.

There were questions regarding the commission&#x27;s plan. Many thought architect Henry Bacon&#x27;s Greek temple design was far too ostentatious for a man of Lincoln&#x27;s humble character. Instead, they proposed a simple log cabin shrine. The site too did not go unopposed. The recently reclaimed land in West Potomac Park was seen by many as either too swampy or too inaccessible. Other sites, such as Washington Union Station, were put forth, but the commission stood firm in its recommendation, feeling that the Potomac Park location, situated on the axis connecting the Washington Monument and Capitol, overlooking the Potomac River and surrounded by open land, was ideal. Furthermore, the Potomac Park site was already designated in the McMillan Plan of 1901 to be the location of a future monument comparable to that of the Washington Monument.

With Congressional approval and a $300,000 allocation, the project got underway. On February 12, 1914, contractor M. F. Comer of Toledo, Ohio; resident member of the memorial&#x27;s commission, former Senator Joseph C. S. Blackburn of Kentucky; and the memorial&#x27;s designer, Henry Bacon, conducted a groundbreaking ceremony by turning over a few spadefuls of earth. The following month is when actual construction began. Work progressed steadily according to schedule. Some changes were made to the plan. The statue of Lincoln, originally designed to be tall, was enlarged to to prevent it from being overwhelmed by the huge chamber. As late as 1920, the decision was made to substitute an open portal for the bronze and glass grille which was to have guarded the entrance. Despite these changes, the Memorial was finished on schedule. Commission president William H. Taft – who was then Chief Justice of the United States – dedicated the Memorial on May 30, 1922, and presented it to President Warren G. Harding, who accepted it on behalf of the American people. Lincoln&#x27;s only surviving son, 78-year-old Robert Todd Lincoln, was in attendance. Prominent African Americans were invited to the event and discovered upon arrival they were assigned a segregated section guarded by U.S. Marines, a policy implemented by director of the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds, Lieutenant Colonel Clarence O. Sherrill.

===Following history ===
The Memorial has become a symbolically sacred venue, especially for the Civil Rights Movement. In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution refused to allow the African-American contralto Marian Anderson to perform before an integrated audience at the organization&#x27;s Constitution Hall. At the suggestion of Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harold L. Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior, arranged for a performance on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday of that year, to a live audience of 75,000 and a nationwide radio audience. On June 29, 1947, Harry Truman became the first president to address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The speech took place at the Lincoln Memorial during the NAACP convention and was carried nationally on radio. In that speech, Truman laid out the need to end discrimination, which would be advanced by the first comprehensive, presidentially proposed civil rights legislation.

On August 28, 1963, the memorial grounds were the site of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which proved to be a high point of the American Civil Rights Movement. It is estimated that approximately 250,000 people came to the event, where they heard Martin Luther King Jr., deliver his historic &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech before the memorial honoring the president who issued the Emancipation Proclamation 100 years earlier. King&#x27;s speech, with its language of patriotism and its evocation of Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address, was meant to match the symbolism of the Lincoln Memorial as a monument to national unity. Labor leader Walter Reuther, an organizer of the march, persuaded the other organizers to move the march to the Lincoln Memorial from the Capitol Building. Reuther believed the location would be less threatening to Congress and that the occasion would be especially appropriate underneath the gaze of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s statue. The D.C. police also appreciated the location because it was surrounded on three sides by water, so that any incident could be easily contained.

The Memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

At the memorial on May 9, 1970, President Richard Nixon had a middle-of-the-night impromptu, brief meeting with protesters who, just days after the Kent State shootings, were preparing to march against the Vietnam War.

On August 28, 1983, crowds gathered again to mark the 20th Anniversary Mobilization for Jobs, Peace and Freedom, to reflect on progress in gaining civil rights for African Americans and to commit to correcting continuing injustices. King&#x27;s speech is such a part of the Lincoln Memorial story, that the spot on which King stood, on the landing eighteen steps below Lincoln&#x27;s statue, was engraved in 2003 in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the event.

==Exterior==

The exterior of the Memorial echoes a classic Greek temple and features Yule marble quarried from Colorado. The structure measures and is tall. It is surrounded by a peristyle of 36 fluted Doric columns, one for each of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln&#x27;s death, and two columns in-antis at the entrance behind the colonnade. The columns stand tall with a base diameter of . Each column is built from 12 drums including the capital. The columns, like the exterior walls and facades, are inclined slightly toward the building&#x27;s interior. This is to compensate for perspective distortions which would otherwise make the memorial appear to bulge out at the top when compared with the bottom, a common feature of Ancient Greek architecture.

Above the colonnade, inscribed on the frieze, are the names of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln&#x27;s death and the dates in which they entered the Union. Their names are separated by double wreath medallions in bas-relief. The cornice is composed of a carved scroll regularly interspersed with projecting lions&#x27; heads and ornamented with palmetto cresting along the upper edge. Above this on the attic frieze are inscribed the names of the 48 states present at the time of the Memorial&#x27;s dedication. A bit higher is a garland joined by ribbons and palm leaves, supported by the wings of eagles. All ornamentation on the friezes and cornices was done by Ernest C. Bairstow.

The Memorial is anchored in a concrete foundation, in depth, constructed by M. F. Comer and Company and the National Foundation and Engineering Company, and is encompassed by a rectangular granite retaining wall measuring in height.

Leading up to the shrine on the east side are the main steps. Beginning at the edge of the Reflecting Pool, the steps rise to the Lincoln Memorial Circle roadway surrounding the edifice, then to the main portal, intermittently spaced with a series of platforms. Flanking the steps as they approach the entrance are two buttresses each crowned with an tall tripod carved from pink Tennessee marble by the Piccirilli Brothers. There are a total of 87 steps (58 steps from the chamber to the plaza and 29 steps from the plaza to the Reflecting Pool).

==Interior==

The Memorial&#x27;s interior is divided into three chambers by two rows of four Ionic columns, each tall and across at their base. The central chamber, housing the statue of Lincoln, is wide, deep, and high. The north and south chambers display carved inscriptions of Lincoln&#x27;s second inaugural address and his Gettysburg Address. Bordering these inscriptions are pilasters ornamented with fasces, eagles, and wreaths. The inscriptions and adjoining ornamentation are by Evelyn Beatrice Longman.

The Memorial is replete with symbolic elements. The 36 columns represent the states of the Union at the time of Lincoln&#x27;s death; the 48 stone festoons above the columns represent the 48 states in 1922. Inside, each inscription is surmounted by a mural by Jules Guerin portraying principles seen as evident in Lincoln&#x27;s life: Freedom, Liberty, Morality, Justice, and the Law on the south wall; Unity, Fraternity, and Charity on the north. Cypress trees, representing Eternity, are in the murals&#x27; backgrounds. The murals&#x27; paint incorporated kerosene and wax to protect the exposed artwork from fluctuations in temperature and moisture.

The ceiling consists of bronze girders ornamented with laurel and oak leaves. Between these are panels of Alabama marble, saturated with paraffin to increase translucency. But feeling that the statue required even more light, Bacon and French designed metal slats for the ceiling to conceal floodlights, which could be modulated to supplement the natural light; this modification was installed in 1929. The one major alteration since was the addition of an elevator for the disabled in the 1970s.

===Statue===
Lying between the north and south chambers of the open-air Memorial is the central hall, which contains the large solitary figure of Abraham Lincoln sitting in contemplation. Its sculptor, Daniel Chester French, supervised the six Piccirilli brothers (Ferruccio, Attilio, Furio, Masaniello, Orazio, and Getulio) in its construction, and it took four years to complete.

The statue, carved from Georgia white marble, was shipped in 28 pieces. Originally intended to be only tall, the sculpture was enlarged to from head to foot considering it would look small within the extensive interior space. If Lincoln were depicted standing, he would be tall.

The widest span of the statue corresponds to its height, and it rests upon an oblong pedestal of Tennessee marble high, wide, and deep. Directly beneath this lies a platform of Tennessee marble about long, wide, and high. Lincoln&#x27;s arms rest on representations of Roman fasces, a subtle touch that associates the statue with the Augustan (and imperial) theme (obelisk and funerary monuments) of the Washington Mall. The statue is discretely bordered by two pilasters, one on each side. Between these pilasters, and above Lincoln&#x27;s head, is engraved an epitaph of Lincoln by Royal Cortissoz. It is important to note that regardless of the aforementioned design intent of the &quot;Roman&quot; fasces, the fasces are features of Etruscan political institutions that were adopted by the Romans, and according to Silius Italicus, these fasce originate from the city of Vetulonia, Italy.

====Sculptural features====
An urban legend holds that the face of General Robert E. Lee is carved onto the back of Lincoln&#x27;s head, and looks back across the Potomac toward his former home, Arlington House (now within the bounds of Arlington National Cemetery). Another popular legend is that Lincoln&#x27;s hands are shown using sign language to represent his initials, his left hand signing an &quot;A&quot; and his right signing an &quot;L&quot;. The National Park Service denies both legends.

However, historian Gerald Prokopowicz writes that, while it is not clear that sculptor Daniel Chester French intended Lincoln&#x27;s hands to be formed into sign language versions of his initials, it is possible that French did intend it. French was familiar with American Sign Language, and he would have had a reason to do so, to pay tribute to Lincoln for having signed the federal legislation giving Gallaudet University, a university for the deaf, the authority to grant college degrees. The National Geographic Society&#x27;s publication &quot;Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C.&quot; states that Daniel Chester French had a son who was deaf and that the sculptor was familiar with sign language. Historian James A. Percoco has observed that, although there are no extant documents showing that French had Lincoln&#x27;s hands carved to represent the letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in American Sign Language, &quot;I think you can conclude that it&#x27;s reasonable to have that kind of summation about the hands.&quot;

===Undercroft===
Below the memorial is an undercroft. During construction, graffiti was scrawled on it by workers, which is considered historical by the National Park Service. During the 1970s and 1980s, there were regular tours of the undercroft. The tours stopped abruptly in 1989 after a visitor noticed asbestos and notified the Service. Due to water seeping through the calcium carbonate within the marble, over time stalactites and stalagmites have formed within it. 
For the memorial&#x27;s centennial in 2022, the undercroft is planned to be open to visitors following a rehabilitation project funded by David Rubenstein. Work started on the $69 million project in 2023 with expected completion by 2026.

Through the renovation, the undercroft will become a visitor area with a museum, theater, store and exhibit section. It is expected to only take up 15,000 square feet of the 50,000 square-foot undercroft. The plan, as of 2024, is for the space to include six floor-to-ceiling glass walls that will provide views of the cathedral-like interior of the undercroft, and an immersive theater presentation that will project images of historic events onto screens and the undercroft’s pillars.

== In popular culture ==
As one of the most prominent American monuments, the Lincoln Memorial is often featured in books, films, videogames, and television shows that take place in Washington; by 2003 it had appeared in over 60 films, and in 2009, Mark S. Reinhart compiled some short sketches of dozens of uses of the Memorial in film and television.

Some examples of films include Frank Capra&#x27;s 1939 film &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, where in a key scene the statue and the Memorial&#x27;s inscription provide inspiration to freshman Senator Jefferson Smith, played by James Stewart. The Park Service did not want Capra to film at the Memorial, so he sent a large crew elsewhere as a distraction while a smaller crew filmed Stewart and Jean Arthur inside the Memorial.

Many of the appearances of the Lincoln Memorial are actually digital visual effects, due to restrictive filming rules. As of 2017, according to the National Park Service, &quot;Filming/photography is prohibited above the white marble steps and the interior chamber of the Lincoln Memorial.&quot;

Mitchell Newton-Matza said in 2016 that &quot;Reflecting its cherished place in the hearts of Americans, the Lincoln Memorial has often been featured prominently in popular culture, especially motion pictures.&quot; According to Tracey Gold Bennett, &quot;The majesty of the Lincoln Memorial is a big draw for film location scouts, producers, and directors because this landmark has appeared in a considerable number of films.&quot;

Jay Sacher writes:

From high to low, the memorial is cultural shorthand for both American ideals and 1960s radicalism. From Forrest Gump&#x27;s Zelig-like insertion into anti-war rallies on the steps of the memorial, to the villainous Decepticon robots discarding the Lincoln statue and claiming it as a throne. ... The memorial&#x27;s place in the culture is assured even as it is parodied.

=== Depictions on U.S. currency ===
From 1959 (the 150th anniversary of Lincoln&#x27;s birth) to 2008, the memorial, with statue visible through the columns, was depicted on the reverse of the United States one-cent coin, which since 1909 has depicted a bust of Lincoln on its front.

The memorial has appeared on the back of the U.S. five-dollar bill since 1929. The front of the bill bears Lincoln&#x27;s portrait.

<text>Titanic is a 1997 American epic romantic disaster film directed, written, co-produced and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of in 1912. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship&#x27;s maiden voyage. The film also features an ensemble cast of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Danny Nucci, David Warner and Bill Paxton.

Cameron&#x27;s inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks. He felt a love story interspersed with human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the &quot;Titanic&quot; wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel&quot; &quot;were shot on board the &quot;Akademik Mstislav Keldysh&quot;, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the &quot;Titanic&quot; built at Baja Studios were used to recreate the sinking. The film was initially in development at 20th Century Fox, but a mounting budget and being behind schedule resulted in Fox asking Paramount Pictures for financial help; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada, while Fox released the film in other territories. &quot;Titanic&quot; was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.

&quot;Titanic&quot; was released on December 19, 1997. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Gloria Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story, and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won a record-tying 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, &quot;Titanic&quot; was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron&#x27;s next film, &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009), surpassed it in 2010. Income from the initial theatrical release, retail video, and soundtrack sales and US broadcast rights exceeded $3.2 billion. A number of re-releases have pushed the film&#x27;s worldwide theatrical total to $2.264 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after &quot;Avatar&quot;. In 2017, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In 1996, aboard the research vessel &quot;Akademik Mstislav Keldysh&quot;, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team explore the wreck of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, hoping to find a necklace known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the day the &quot;Titanic&quot; struck an iceberg and sank, resulting in about 1,500 deaths. After seeing a television report about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, revealing herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose and her granddaughter aboard the &quot;Keldysh&quot;, where Rose recounts her experience as a &quot;Titanic&quot; passenger.

In 1912, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater boards the &quot;Titanic&quot; in Southampton with her wealthy fiancé, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth. Ruth stresses that Rose&#x27;s marriage to Cal will resolve their financial problems, but Rose is unhappy in the loveless engagement. Feeling trapped, Rose contemplates suicide by jumping from the ship&#x27;s stern, but is stopped by Jack Dawson, a poor nomadic artist. Jack and Rose form a friendship, and Jack confesses his growing feelings for her. Though initially resistant, Rose realizes she has fallen in love with Jack, despite Cal&#x27;s and Ruth&#x27;s disapproval.

Rose brings Jack to her stateroom and asks him to draw her nude wearing only the necklace. Afterward, they evade Cal&#x27;s valet, Spicer Lovejoy, and have sex in a car in the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship&#x27;s collision with an iceberg and overhear officers discussing the severity of the situation. When Cal discovers Jack&#x27;s sketch of Rose and a mocking note she left, he arranges to frame Jack for theft by having Lovejoy plant the necklace on him. Jack is arrested and locked in the master-at-arms&#x27; office, while Cal places the necklace in his coat pocket.

As the ship begins sinking, women and children are prioritized for the lifeboats. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they return to the deck, where Cal urges Rose to board a lifeboat, claiming he and Jack will board another lifeboat. He unwittingly wraps his coat, containing the necklace, around her. However, as her lifeboat is lowered, Rose jumps back onto the sinking ship, unwilling to leave Jack behind. Enraged, Cal grabs a pistol and chases them through the flooding ship but gives up when they escape. Cal manages to secure a place on a lifeboat by pretending to be a child&#x27;s father.

As the ship&#x27;s flooded bow sinks, the stern rises into the air, and Jack and Rose cling to the railing. The ship splits in two, and the stern sinks into the freezing water with the remaining passengers. Jack helps Rose onto a small floating piece of debris and makes her promise to survive and live a full life. Jack dies from hypothermia, but Rose is saved by a returning lifeboat, and later rescued by the . Rose remains hidden from Cal and her mother, and gives her name as Rose Dawson on her arrival in New York City.

In the present, Rose reveals that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the 1929 stock market crash. She tells the &quot;Keldysh&quot; crew that Jack saved her in every possible way, and laments that her memories are all that she has left of him. Touched by her account of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, Lovett abandons his search for the necklace. Alone at night on the stern of the &quot;Keldysh&quot;, Rose, who has kept the necklace in her possession all along, drops it into the sea above the wreck. Later, as she lies in her bed, photographs on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack. Aboard the pristine and undamaged &quot;Titanic&quot;, a young Rose reunites with Jack at the Grand Staircase, applauded by the passengers and crew who died in the sinking.

==Cast==
===Fictional characters===

* Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson. Cameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on the &quot;Titanic&quot;, to relive its liveliness, and &quot;to take that energy and give it to Jack, ... an artist who is able to have his heart soar&quot;. Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, including Paris. He wins two third-class tickets for the &quot;Titanic&quot; in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fiancé&#x27;s invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with first-class passengers for a night. Cameron&#x27;s original choice for the role was River Phoenix; however, he died in 1993. Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey, Chris O&#x27;Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff were considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested, but his asking price was too high. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron&#x27;s attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene. Cameron said, &quot;He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.&quot; Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio&#x27;s acting ability and told him, &quot;Look, I&#x27;m not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I&#x27;m not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want.&quot; Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled &quot;J. Dawson&quot;. The producers did not know of the real J. Dawson until after the film was released.
* Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Cameron said Winslet &quot;had the thing that you look for&quot; and that there was &quot;a quality in her face, in her eyes&quot; that he &quot;just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her&quot;. Rose is a 17-year-old girl from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father&#x27;s death left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards &quot;Titanic&quot; with Cal and Ruth as a first-class passenger and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, &quot;She has got a lot to give, and she&#x27;s got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that&#x27;s not going to happen.&quot; Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes (who had worked with DiCaprio in &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; the previous year), Gabrielle Anwar, and Reese Witherspoon were considered for the role. When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron&#x27;s attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as &quot;an Audrey Hepburn type&quot;. He was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him that she whispered to Cameron, &quot;He&#x27;s great. Even if you don&#x27;t pick me, pick him.&quot; Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, &quot;From Your Rose&quot;, and lobbied him by phone. &quot;You don&#x27;t understand!&quot; she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. &quot;I am Rose! I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re even seeing anyone else!&quot; Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.
* Billy Zane as Cal Hockley, Rose&#x27;s arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fiancé, who is the heir to a Pittsburgh steel fortune. He is resentful of Rose&#x27;s affection for Jack. Cameron initially considered Michael Biehn, whom he had previously collaborated with on &quot;The Terminator, Aliens&quot;, and &quot;The Abyss&quot;, for the role, before offering it to Matthew McConaughey, and Rob Lowe said he pursued it.
* Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose&#x27;s widowed mother, who arranges Rose&#x27;s engagement to Cal to maintain her family&#x27;s high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter&#x27;s life.
* Gloria Stuart as the modern-day Rose Dawson Calvert. Rose narrates the film in a framing device. Cameron stated, &quot;In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history.&quot; The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the Heart of the Ocean after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role. Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, &quot;My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties.&quot; Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was. Fay Wray was also considered for the role, but Cameron said, &quot;[Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet&#x27;s] spirit. I saw this &quot;joie de vivre&quot; in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it&#x27;s the same person.&quot;
* Bill Paxton as Brock Lovett, a treasure hunter looking for the Heart of the Ocean in the wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He reflects at the film&#x27;s conclusion that, despite thinking about &quot;Titanic&quot; for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose&#x27;s story.
* Suzy Amis as Elizabeth &quot;Lizzy&quot; Calvert, Rose&#x27;s granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother&#x27;s romantic past with Jack Dawson.
* Danny Nucci as Fabrizio De Rossi, Jack&#x27;s Italian best friend, who boards &quot;Titanic&quot; with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when the &quot;Titanic&quot; sinks and is killed when one of the ship&#x27;s funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death.
* David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy, an ex-Pinkerton constable and Cal&#x27;s English valet and bodyguard. He monitors Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when the &quot;Titanic&quot; splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner also appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries &quot;S.O.S. Titanic&quot;, portraying passenger Lawrence Beesley.
* Jason Barry as Tommy Ryan, an Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.
* Alexandrea Owens-Sarno as Cora Cartmell, a young third-class girl who dances with Jack at the Irish party. In a deleted scene, Cora and her family drowned after they were trapped at the locked third-class gate.
* Camilla Overbye Roos as Helga Dahl, a Norwegian immigrant and third-class passenger who falls in love with Fabrizio. While most of her scenes were cut and the secondary significance of her character was drastically reduced from the original screenplay to the final theatrical cut, Helga is most notably seen clinging onto the rail of the ship&#x27;s stern with Jack and Rose before slipping into the frigid waters below.
* Amy Gaipa as Trudy Bolt, Rose&#x27;s personal maid.

===Historical characters===
Although not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events, the film includes portrayals of various historical figures:

* Kathy Bates as Margaret &quot;Molly&quot; Brown. Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as &quot;vulgar&quot; and &quot;new money&quot;. She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed the Unsinkable Molly Brown by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered Lifeboat 6 from Quartermaster Robert Hichens. Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron&#x27;s film. Reba McEntire was offered the role but had to turn it down because it conflicted with her touring schedule.
* Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews, the ship&#x27;s builder. Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a &quot;mathematical certainty&quot; that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (&quot;Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder&quot;) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40 a.m. There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts; then he continued assisting with the evacuation. 

* Bernard Hill as Captain Edward John Smith. Smith planned to make the &quot;Titanic&quot; his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the windows burst from the water pressure whilst he clings to the ship&#x27;s wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat B.
* Jonathan Hyde as J. Bruce Ismay, White Star Line&#x27;s ignorant, boorish managing director. With the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention, Ismay influences Captain Smith to go faster; although this situation appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence. After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his &quot;unsinkable&quot; ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children drowned.
* Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV, a first-class passenger and the richest man on the ship. In the film, Rose introduces Jack to Astor and his 18-year-old wife, Madeleine (Charlotte Chatton), in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks whether Jack is connected to the &quot;Boston Dawsons&quot;, a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the glass dome over the Grand Staircase implodes and water surges in.
* Bernard Fox as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV. The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that &quot;women and machinery don&#x27;t mix&quot; and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, unaware that Jack saved Rose from a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox portrayed Frederick Fleet in the 1958 film &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;.
* Michael Ensign as Benjamin Guggenheim, a mining magnate traveling in first class. He shows off his French mistress, Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett), to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the first-class passengers for dinner after rescuing Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a &quot;bohemian&quot;. Guggenheim is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.

* Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley, the ship&#x27;s bandmaster and violinist, who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot;, to the tune of Bethany, and dies in the sinking.
* Mark Lindsay Chapman as Chief Officer Henry Wilde, the ship&#x27;s chief officer, who lets Cal board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, leading to her rescue.
* Ewan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch, the officer in charge of the bridge when the &quot;Titanic&quot; struck an iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic and then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch&#x27;s nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle&#x27;s portrayal, seeing it as damaging to Murdoch&#x27;s heroic reputation. A few months later, Fox vice president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school&#x27;s William Murdoch Memorial Prize. Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the &quot;women and children first&quot; policy. According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an &quot;honorable man,&quot; not of a man &quot;gone bad&quot; or of a &quot;cowardly murderer.&quot; He added, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;d find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.&quot;
* Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. In the film, Lightoller informs Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water and, after the collision, suggests that the crew begin boarding women and children in the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to survive the disaster.
* Film producer Kevin De La Noy as Third Officer Herbert Pitman, who survived the sinking and manned Lifeboat 5
* Simon Crane as Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, the officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.
* Ioan Gruffudd as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, the only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.
* Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody, the only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch&#x27;s orders to put the ship to full speed ahead and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.
* James Lancaster as Father Thomas Byles, a second-class passenger and a Catholic priest from England. He is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship&#x27;s final moments.
* Lew Palter and Elsa Raven as Isidor and Ida Straus. Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, the couple were offered seats on a lifeboat together. Isidor refused to go before all women and children have been evacuated, and urged his wife Ida to go ahead. Ida is portrayed refusing to board the lifeboat, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed, embracing each other as water fills their stateroom; the real Isidor and Ida Straus were also seen in an embrace but were actually seated on chairs in the A Deck before being swept by waves as the ship made its final plunge.
* Martin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, a Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the &quot;women and children first&quot; policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat&#x27;s crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife&#x27;s secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the &quot;Titanic&quot; was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade&#x27;s inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon&#x27;s denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.
* Rosalind Ayres as Lady Duff-Gordon, a world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo&#x27;s wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat&#x27;s crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped. Jarvis and Ayres were husband and wife in real life.
* Rochelle Rose as Noël Leslie, Countess of Rothes. The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers.
* Scott G. Anderson as Frederick Fleet, the lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.
* Paul Brightwell as Quartermaster Robert Hichens, one of the six quartermasters and at the ship&#x27;s wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge of lifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.
* Martin East as Reginald Lee, the other lookout in the crow&#x27;s nest. He survives the sinking.
* Gregory Cooke as Jack Phillips, the senior wireless operator whom Captain Smith ordered to send the distress signal.
* Craig Kelly as Harold Bride, a junior wireless operator.
* Liam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin. The baker appears in the film helping Rose stand up after she falls, following her and Jack to the ship&#x27;s stern, and finally hanging onto the ship&#x27;s railing as it sinks, drinking brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin&#x27;s testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol. In a deleted scene, he&#x27;s shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle.
* Terry Forrestal as Chief Engineer Joseph G. Bell: Bell and his men worked throughout the sinking to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. The film portrays Bell and all of the engineers as having died in the bowels of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, however there is evidence to suggest that at least some of the engineers were released to come on deck when the flooding became severe. Greaser Frederick Scott testified to seeing eight engineers between approximately 1:50 and 1:55 a.m. standing up against the electric crane on the starboard Boat Deck; by then, all the lifeboats had gone.

===Cameos ===
Several crew members of the &quot;Akademik Mstislav Keldysh&quot; appear, including Anatoly Sagalevich, the creator and pilot of the &quot;Mir&quot; self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle. Van Ling portrayed Fang Lang; his backstory inspired Cameron to produce a documentary &quot;The Six&quot;, based on a group of Chinese survivors who survived the sinking. Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film&#x27;s sets for the &quot;Titanic&quot; Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.

==Pre-production==

===Writing and inspiration===

James Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for him &quot;Titanic&quot; was &quot;the Mount Everest of shipwrecks&quot;. He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had &quot;a mental restlessness&quot; to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. When an IMAX film, &quot;Titanica&quot;, was made from footage shot of the &quot;Titanic&quot; wreck, Cameron decided to seek Hollywood funding for his own expedition. It was &quot;not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,&quot; Cameron said. &quot;I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.&quot;

Cameron wrote a scriptment for a &quot;Titanic&quot; film, met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as &quot;&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; on the &quot;Titanic&quot;&quot;. Cameron said the executives were unconvinced of the commercial potential, and had instead hoped for action scenes similar to his previous films. They approved the project as they hoped for a long-term relationship with Cameron.

Cameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the &quot;Titanic&quot; wreck, and organized several dives over a period of two years. He also convinced Fox that shooting the real wreck for the film scenes, instead of simulating it with special effects, would provide value: &quot;We can either do [the shots] with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.&quot;

The crew shot at the wreck in the Atlantic Ocean 12 times in 1995. The work was risky, as the water pressure could kill the crew if there were a tiny flaw in the submersible structure. Additionally, adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting footage. During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with &quot;Titanic&quot;″s hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible&#x27;s propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of the captain&#x27;s quarters collapsed, exposing the interior, and the area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was damaged.

Descending to the site emphasized to the crew that the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster was not simply a story but a real event with real loss of life. Cameron said: &quot;Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.&quot; He felt a &quot;great mantle of responsibility&quot; to convey the emotional message of the story, as he was aware there might never be another filmmaker to visit the wreck.

Cameron felt the &quot;Titanic&quot; sinking was &quot;like a great novel that really happened&quot;, but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history. The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy. He believed that the romance of Jack and Rose would be the most engaging element: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss. He said: &quot;All my films are love stories, but in &quot;Titanic&quot; I finally got the balance right. It&#x27;s not a disaster film. It&#x27;s a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.&quot;

After filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay. He wanted to honor the people who died, and spent six months researching the &quot;Titanic&quot;″s crew and passengers. He created a detailed timeline of the events of the voyage and sinking and had it verified by historical experts. From the beginning of the shoot, the team had &quot;a very clear picture&quot; of what happened on the ship. Cameron said &quot;That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you&#x27;d gone back in a time machine and shot it.&quot; Cameron was influenced by the 1958 British film about &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage, and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking.

Cameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant. While Winslet and Stuart believed Rose dies at the end of the film, Cameron said &quot;the answer has to be something you supply personally; individually&quot;.

===Scale modeling===
Harland &amp; Wolff, &quot;Titanic&quot; builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship&#x27;s interiors, production designer Peter Lamont&#x27;s team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch. Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating. Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the &quot;Titanic&quot; sister ship . Above the model was a tower crane on of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.

The sets representing the interior rooms of the &quot;Titanic&quot; were reproduced exactly using photographs and plans from the &quot;Titanic&quot; builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plasterwork based on &quot;Titanic&quot; original designs. The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs. Cameron hired two &quot;Titanic&quot; historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail.

==Production==
Principal photography began on July 31, 1996 at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the &quot;Akademik Mstislav Keldysh&quot;. In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale &quot;Titanic&quot; had been constructed. The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship&#x27;s stern rose during the sinking. For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber. By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron built his &quot;Titanic&quot; on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship&#x27;s departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction. A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912. Despite this, several critics noted anachronisms in the film.
Cameron sketched Jack&#x27;s portrait of Rose; Winslet posed in a bathing suit. Cameron felt the scene had a backdrop of repression and freedom: &quot;You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It&#x27;s kind of exhilarating for that reason,&quot; he said. The sketching scene was DiCaprio and Winslet&#x27;s first scene together. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t by any kind of design, although I couldn&#x27;t have designed it better. There&#x27;s a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,&quot; Cameron stated. &quot;They had rehearsed together, but they hadn&#x27;t shot anything together. If I&#x27;d had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.&quot; Cameron said he and his crew &quot;were just trying to find things to shoot&quot; because the big set &quot;wasn&#x27;t ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.&quot; Cameron felt the final scene worked well.

The shoot was an arduous experience that &quot;cemented Cameron&#x27;s formidable reputation as &#x27;the scariest man in Hollywood&quot;. He became known as an &quot;uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist&quot; and a &quot;300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people&#x27;s faces on a 162ft crane&quot;. Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship would sink. &quot;There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn&#x27;t believe,&quot; she said. &quot;&#x27;God damn it!&#x27; he would yell at some poor crew member, &#x27;That&#x27;s exactly what I didn&#x27;t want!&#x27;&quot; Bill Paxton was familiar with Cameron&#x27;s work ethic from his earlier experience, and said: &quot;There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds.&quot; The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him &quot;Mij&quot; (Jim spelled backwards). In response to the criticism, Cameron said, &quot;Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.&quot; More than 800 crew members worked on the film.

On August 9, 1996, during the &quot;Akademik Mstislav Keldysh&quot; shoot in Canada, an unknown person, suspected to be a crew member, put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. It sent more than 50 people to the hospital. Paxton and Cameron ate the soup and went to the hospital but Paxton decided to leave, telling Cameron &quot;Jim, I&#x27;m not gonna hang out here, this is bedlam. I&#x27;m gonna ... wander back down to the set and just drink a case of beer.&quot; &quot;There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,&quot; said actor Lewis Abernathy. Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. &quot;One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he&#x27;d been sniffing glue since he was four.&quot; The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August 27, and the Halifax Regional Police Service announced a criminal investigation the next day. The investigation was closed in February 1999. The person behind the poisoning was never caught.

The filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160 (filming officially wrapped on March 23, 1997). Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned &quot;a lot of money&quot;. Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:

The costs of filming &quot;Titanic&quot; ballooned and eventually reached $200 million, a bit over $1 million per minute of screen time. Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, &quot;You want to cut my movie? You&#x27;re going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You&#x27;re going to have to kill me!&quot; The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment. The executives initially rejected Cameron&#x27;s offer to forfeit his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely. Worried about the mounting costs, Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co-finance the film. Fox first approached Universal Pictures as they had picked up the international distribution rights to Cameron&#x27;s &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994) when production costs began to mount; however Universal would turn Fox down. Instead, Fox and Paramount Pictures came together in May 1996 following the success both studios had collaborating on the distribution for Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Braveheart&quot; (1995), and ultimately agreed to co-finance the film together and split the distribution rights. In an effort to recoup their $135 million investment, Fox sold the domestic rights to the film to Paramount in return for Paramount providing Fox an additional $65 million for production, while retaining international rights; Fox however would still be responsible for any further budget overruns going forward, but also retain all profits from any merchandise sold based on the film as part of the deal with Paramount.

Cameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. &quot;...the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than &quot;T2&quot; and &quot;True Lies.&quot; Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. &quot;Titanic&quot; also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,&quot; he said. &quot;As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that&#x27;s writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn&#x27;t force me to do it; they were glad that I did.&quot; Amidst the film&#x27;s successful box office run, a Fox executive, William Mechanic, commented that &quot;Jim Cameron told us we could have an expensive bad movie or a more expensive potentially great movie. We made our judgment. And we made the best choice.&quot;

In July 2024, Cameron stated that it was actually co-producer Jon Landau who &quot;bore the brunt of the studio pressure&quot; when &quot;Titanic&quot; was being made. According to Cameron, Landau &quot;gave his all to provide the time and resources for me to make the film I saw in my head.&quot;

==Post-production==
===Effects===
Cameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. Many previous films about &quot;Titanic&quot; shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing. Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their miniature of the ship as if &quot;we&#x27;re making a commercial for the White Star Line&quot;. Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a model of the ship&#x27;s stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water. For scenes set in the ship&#x27;s engines, footage of the SS &quot;Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien&quot;″s engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen. In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors. The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.

An enclosed tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The exterior of &quot;Titanic&quot; had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett&#x27;s ROV traversing the wreck in the present. The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a tank, where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.

The climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous &quot;Titanic&quot; films for depicting the liner&#x27;s final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He &quot;wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was&quot;. When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt artists resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized &quot;by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls&quot;. A Linux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.

===Editing===
Cameron said there were aspects of the &quot;Titanic&quot; story that seemed important in pre- and post-production but became less important as the film evolved. He omitted the SS &quot;Californian&quot;, the ship that was close to the &quot;Titanic&quot; the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew&#x27;s SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. A scene involving the &quot;Californian&quot; was cut, according to Cameron, &quot;because it focuses you back onto that world. If &quot;Titanic&quot; is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.&quot; He said its omission was not &quot;a compromise to mainstream filmmaking&quot; but &quot;about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film&quot;.

During the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the ending. In the original version, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose reveals that she had the Heart of the Ocean diamond all along but never sold it, to live on her own without Cal&#x27;s money. She allows Brock to hold it but tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the scene, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience&#x27;s melancholy after the &quot;Titanic&quot; sinking. Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock&#x27;s epiphany and laugh was unnecessary, saying &quot;I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better... Our job was done by then... If you&#x27;re smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you&#x27;ll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need.&quot;

The version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon. The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and had Cal offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the Heart of the Ocean if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a window; this is why Lovejoy has a gash later in the film. Test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one&#x27;s life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.

===Heart of the Ocean===
For the Heart of the Ocean design, London-based jewelers Asprey &amp; Garrard used cubic zirconias set in white gold to create an Edwardian-style necklace to be used as a prop in the film. The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character. Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.

The third and final design was not used in the film. After the film&#x27;s success, Asprey &amp; Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, heart-shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds. This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to Sotheby&#x27;s auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California&#x27;s Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client for $1.4 million (equivalent to $ million in ), under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. Since then, this necklace has not been made available for public viewing.

==Soundtrack==

Cameron wrote &quot;Titanic&quot; while listening to the work of the Irish new-age musician Enya. After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film, Cameron instead chose James Horner. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on &quot;Aliens,&quot; but &quot;Titanic&quot; cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner&#x27;s death. For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as &quot;Sissel&quot;. Horner knew Sissel from her album &quot;Innerst i sjelen&quot;, and particularly liked how she sang &quot;Eg veit i himmerik ei borg&quot; (&quot;I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle&quot;). He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel.

Horner wrote the end theme, &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs in the film. Céline Dion agreed to record a demo at the persuasion of her husband René Angélil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for &quot;going commercial at the end of the movie&quot;. Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and &quot;saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion&quot;.

The soundtrack was the best-selling album of 1998 with sales of over 27 million.

==Release==
===Initial screening===
Distribution for &quot;Titanic&quot; was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handling the domestic distribution, and Fox handling the foreign release. Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997. The film was to be released on this date &quot;to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better&quot;. In April, Cameron said the film&#x27;s special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible. The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, but Harrison Ford, whose film &quot;Air Force One&quot; was to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrative &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; franchises, that he would never work with them again if they released &quot;Titanic&quot; so close to his own film. On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997. The film&#x27;s new release date would be shared by &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; and &quot;Mouse Hunt&quot;. &quot;This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.&quot; A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 &quot;generated positive reviews&quot; and &quot;[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]&quot;. This eventually led to more positive media coverage.

Cameron refused to hold the film&#x27;s world premiere in Los Angeles. Paramount disagreed with Cameron&#x27;s decision, but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival, where reaction was described as &quot;tepid&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where &quot;the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media&quot;.

==Box office==
Including revenue from the 2012, 2017 and 2023 reissues, &quot;Titanic&quot; earned $674.3 million in North America and $1.583 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.257 billion. It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, beating &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993). The film remained so for twelve years, until &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010. It would hold the record for being Paramount&#x27;s highest-grossing film domestically until it was dethroned by &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; (2022) twenty-five years later. On March 1, 1998, it became the first film to earn more than $1 billion worldwide and on the weekend April 13–15, 2012—a century after the original vessel&#x27;s foundering, &quot;Titanic&quot; became the second film to cross the $2 billion threshold during its 3D re-release. Box Office Mojo estimates that &quot;Titanic&quot; is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation. The site also estimates that the film sold over 128 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.

&quot;Titanic&quot; was the first foreign-language film to succeed in India, which claims to have the largest movie-going audience in the world. A &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; report attributes this to the film&#x27;s similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films.

===Initial theatrical run===
&quot;Titanic&quot; received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of &quot;Mouse Hunt&quot;, &quot;Scream 2&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. It would go on to surpass &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;″s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing &quot;Scream 2&quot;. By New Year&#x27;s Day, &quot;Titanic&quot; had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300 million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, which took 67 days to do so. &quot;Titanic&quot; would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. Additionally, the film reached the $400 million mark within 66 days, which was the fastest at the time, a record that would be matched by &quot;Spider-Man&quot; in 2002. Both films would remain so until they were surpassed in 2004 by &quot;Shrek 2&quot;.

&quot;Titanic&quot;″s highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut. On March 14, it surpassed &quot;Star Wars&quot; as the highest-grossing film ever in North America. It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film. By April 1998, the film&#x27;s number one spot would be overtaken by &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, dropping into second place. The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188, equivalent to $ million in . Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080 and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.

===Commercial analysis===
Before &quot;Titanic&quot;″s release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time. When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, &quot;it was with massive forebodings&quot;, since the &quot;people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making&quot;. Cameron also thought he was &quot;headed for disaster&quot; at one point during filming. &quot;We labored the last six months on &quot;Titanic&quot; in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,&quot; he stated. As the film neared release, &quot;particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance&quot;. A film critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Cameron&#x27;s overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project&quot; and that the film was &quot;a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances&quot;.

When the film became a success, with an unprecedented box-office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers&#x27; emotions. The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened, and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends, and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays. 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen &quot;Titanic&quot; twice by its fifth week. Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused &quot;Leo-Mania&quot; were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record, other reports have attributed the film&#x27;s success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4 billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4 billion after ancillary sources.

&quot;Titanic&quot;″s impact on men has also been especially credited. It is considered one of the films that make men cry, with MSNBC&#x27;s Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack&#x27;s sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack. The film&#x27;s ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film &quot;Zombieland&quot;, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: &quot;I haven&#x27;t cried like that since &quot;Titanic&quot;.&quot;

Scott Meslow of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; stated while &quot;Titanic&quot; initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film &quot;for 15-year-old girls&quot; by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing &quot;Titanic&quot; as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film&#x27;s accomplishment: &quot;that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys.&quot; Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like &quot;Iron Man&quot;, it is common for boys and men to deny liking &quot;Titanic&quot;. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. &quot;It&#x27;s this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) &quot;Titanic&quot; an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,&quot; he stated. &quot;&quot;Titanic&quot; has flaws, but for all its legacy, it&#x27;s better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It&#x27;s a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a great movie for everyone else too.&quot;

Quotes in the film aided its popularity. &quot;Titanic&quot; catchphrase &quot;I&#x27;m the king of the world!&quot; became one of the film industry&#x27;s more popular quotations. According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. &quot;People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh&quot;, he said.

Cameron explained the film&#x27;s success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. &quot;When people have an experience that&#x27;s very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,&quot; he said. &quot;They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That&#x27;s how &quot;Titanic&quot; worked.&quot; Media Awareness Network stated, &quot;The normal
repeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for &quot;Titanic&quot; was over 20%.&quot; The box office receipts &quot;were even more impressive&quot; when factoring in &quot;the film&#x27;s 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie&#x27;s four showings&quot;. In response to this, &quot;[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am&quot;.

&quot;Titanic&quot; held the record for box office gross for 12 years. Cameron&#x27;s follow-up film, &quot;Avatar&quot;, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross, and did so in 2010. Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge &quot;Titanic&quot; were given. For one, &quot;Two-thirds of &quot;Titanic&quot; haul was earned overseas, and &quot;Avatar&quot; [tracked] similarly... &quot;Avatar&quot; opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them&quot; and the markets &quot;such as Russia, where &quot;Titanic&quot; saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today&quot; with &quot;more screens and moviegoers&quot; than ever before. Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while &quot;Avatar&quot; may beat &quot;Titanic&quot; revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass &quot;Titanic&quot; in attendance. &quot;Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.&quot; In December 2009, Cameron had stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s realistic to try to topple &quot;Titanic&quot; off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. &quot;Titanic&quot; just struck some kind of chord.&quot; In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once &quot;Avatar&quot; performance was easier to predict, saying &quot;It&#x27;s gonna happen. It&#x27;s just a matter of time,&quot;.

Author Alexandra Keller, when analyzing &quot;Titanic&quot;″s success, stated that scholars could agree that the film&#x27;s popularity &quot;appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s – awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.&quot;

==Critical reception==
===Initial===
&quot;Titanic&quot; garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film&#x27;s cultural, historical, and political impacts. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 255 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.&quot; Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.

With regard to the film&#x27;s overall design, Roger Ebert stated: &quot;It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.&quot; He credited the &quot;technical difficulties&quot; with being &quot;so daunting that it&#x27;s a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion&quot; and &quot;found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga&quot;. He named it his ninth-best film of 1997. On the television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, the film received &quot;two thumbs up&quot; and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship&#x27;s sinking; Ebert described the film as &quot;a glorious Hollywood epic&quot; and &quot;well worth the wait,&quot; and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio &quot;captivating&quot;.

James Berardinelli stated: &quot;Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, &quot;Titanic&quot; is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don&#x27;t just watch &quot;Titanic&quot;, you experience it.&quot; It was named his second best film of 1997. Joseph McBride of &quot;Boxoffice Magazine&quot; concluded: &quot;To describe &quot;Titanic&quot; as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron&#x27;s recreation of the 1912 sinking of the &#x27;unsinkable&#x27; liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.&quot;

The romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of &quot;Urban Cinefile&quot; said: &quot;You will walk out of &quot;Titanic&quot; not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the film as &quot;a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that &quot;Cameron&#x27;s magnificent &quot;Titanic&quot; is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;.&quot; Adrian Turner of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded it four stars out of five, stating &quot;Cameron&#x27;s script wouldn&#x27;t have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours. &quot;Titanic&quot; is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesome albatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.&quot;

&quot;Titanic&quot; suffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements. Kenneth Turan&#x27;s review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, &quot;What really brings on the tears is Cameron&#x27;s insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.&quot; He later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total. Barbara Shulgasser of &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; gave &quot;Titanic&quot; one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, &quot;The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.&quot;

===Retrospective===
According to Dalin Rowell of &quot;/Film&quot;, &quot;With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, &quot;Titanic&quot; is no stranger to modern-day criticism.&quot; In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it &quot;the most dreadful piece of work I&#x27;ve ever seen in my entire life&quot;. Similarly, French New Wave director and former &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as &quot;garbage&quot; in a 1998 interview with Frédéric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet&#x27;s performance, who he said was &quot;unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.&quot; In 2003, the film topped a poll of &quot;Best Film Endings&quot;, but it also topped a poll by &quot;Film 2003&quot; as &quot;the worst movie of all time&quot;.

In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the &quot;Titanic&quot;, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, &quot;Cameron&#x27;s film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered.&quot; The British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers&#x27; tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. &quot;What really irks me...,&quot; he said, &quot;are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.&quot; Willcock stated, &quot;I obviously don&#x27;t have anything against those who dislike &quot;Titanic&quot;, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.&quot;

In 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan&#x27;s review in particular, by writing &quot;&quot;Titanic&quot; is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.&quot; Cameron emphasized that people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were &quot;celebrating their own essential humanity&quot; by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally &quot;incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric&quot; and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. &quot;Turan mistakes archetype for cliché,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#x27;t share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.&quot;

In 2000, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that &quot;the critical knives were out long before James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; was complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong.&quot; He added that &quot;the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy&quot; and that &quot;when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; eventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: &quot;It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot; at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet&#x27;s favourite film. Ever.&quot;

In 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The same year, Cameron reviewed the accuracy of the film for the National Geographic program &quot;Titanic: 20 Years Later with James Cameron&quot;.

The film&#x27;s climax has sparked many debates over the years on whether both Jack and Rose should have been able to fit on the floating door and survive, becoming among the most talked about aspects of the film. While at the time of the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary Cameron stated that it was &quot;kind of silly, really, that we’re having this discussion 20 years later,&quot; in 2023 he conducted a study for the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary that aired as part of an updated National Geographic retrospective, which suggested it was possible but unlikely and depended on numerous variables., after a previous test had been conducted in 2012 by &quot;MythBusters&quot;. 

It was listed among the 100 best films in an &quot;Empire&quot; poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry. In 2021, Dalin Rowell of &quot;/Film&quot; ranked it the third-best film of Cameron&#x27;s career, stating that it is &quot;easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds&quot;, and considering it &quot;a legitimately remarkable achievement — one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way, &quot;Titanic&quot; demonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.&quot;

In 2024, &quot;Looper&quot; ranked it number 44 on its list of the &quot;50 Best PG-13 Movies of All Time,&quot; writing 

==Accolades==

At the Golden Globes, &quot;Titanic&quot; won Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. Winslet and Stuart were also nominated. At the 70th Academy Awards, &quot;Titanic&quot; garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s &quot;All About Eve&quot; and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the &quot;Titanic&quot; to win that award, after 1933&#x27;s &quot;Cavalcade&quot;), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song. Winslet, Stuart and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;, Kim Basinger in &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and &quot;Men in Black&quot;. &quot;Titanic&quot; was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after &quot;Ben-Hur (1959).&quot; &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; matched the record in 2004. In 2017, &quot;La La Land&quot; would tie the record for having the most Academy Award nominations.

&quot;Titanic&quot; won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone. It was also the best-selling album of 1998 in the US. &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.

&quot;Titanic&quot; also won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year. It eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world. The book about the making of the film was at the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ bestseller list for several weeks, &quot;the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status&quot;.

&quot;Titanic&quot; has appeared on the American Film Institute&#x27;s award-winning 100 Years... series six times.

==Home media==
&quot;Titanic&quot; was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998. There are two separate cassettes on this release, as the film is divided into two parts. More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film. Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million, becoming the best selling live-action video, beating &quot;Independence Day&quot;. In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling &quot;The Lion King&quot; for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million. By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units. In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country&#x27;s fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed by &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day. The film would also remain as the fastest-selling DVD in the United Kingdom until &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; took it in 2008. Within the first week of release, &quot;Titanic&quot; quickly beat &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, selling a total of 1.8 million home video copies.

NBC acquired the US television broadcast rights for $30 million, which was considered a bargain.

A DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies. At the time, less than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. &quot;When we released the original &quot;Titanic&quot; DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,&quot; said Meagan Burrows, Paramount&#x27;s president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film&#x27;s DVD performance even more impressive.

&quot;Titanic&quot; was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-disc &quot;Special Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, a 6.1 DTS-ES Discrete surround sound mix and various special features. In PAL regions, two-disc and four-disc variants were released, marketed as the &quot;Special Edition&quot; and &quot;Deluxe Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; respectively. They were released in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title &quot;Deluxe Limited Edition&quot;, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron&#x27;s documentary &quot;Ghosts of the Abyss&quot;, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of &quot;Ghosts of the Abyss&quot;, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set. In 2007, for the film&#x27;s tenth anniversary, a &quot;10th Anniversary Edition&quot; was released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.

The film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on September 10, 2012. The 3D presentation of the film is split over two discs and is also THX-certified. Special features on another disc included many of those featured on the 2005 &quot;Special Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; DVD along with two new documentaries titled &quot;Reflections on Titanic&quot; and &quot;Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron.&quot; The latter aired on National Geographic on April 9, 2012, and was executively produced by Cameron.

A 4K release of the film was released on December 5, 2023, on both digital and Ultra HD Blu-ray.

After previously being on the Amazon Prime Video streaming service in the U.S. in April 2023, the film became available on Netflix in July 2023 shortly after the Titan submersible implosion. The film became available on Paramount+ in October 2023 and on Prime Video for a period starting in April 2024. The film was announced as coming to Hulu in February 2025. It was available on the free ad-supported streaming service Pluto TV in June 2023.

== Re-release ==

===3D conversion===
A 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The &quot;Titanic&quot; 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration. The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D. Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process. The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose&#x27;s view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.
The 3D version of &quot;Titanic&quot; premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance, and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days before the centenary of &quot;Titanic&quot; embarking on her maiden voyage.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue stars out of 4, explaining he found it &quot;pretty damn dazzling&quot;. He said, &quot;The 3D intensifies &quot;Titanic&quot;. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.&quot; Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, &quot;For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don&#x27;t look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot;, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: &quot;I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.&quot; In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the &quot;careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.&quot; Ann Hornaday for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found herself asking &quot;whether the film&#x27;s twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron&#x27;s 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren&#x27;t.&quot; She added that the &quot;3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.&quot;

The film grossed an estimated $4.7 million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3 million over the weekend, finishing in third place behind &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; and &quot;American Reunion&quot;. Outside North America it earned $35.2 million, finishing second, and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9 million. China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6 million on its opening day, going on to earn a record-breaking $67 million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.

The reissue earned $343.4 million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8 million from Canada and the United States. With a worldwide box office of nearly $350 million, the 3D re-release of &quot;Titanic&quot; remains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;Avatar&quot;.

The 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film&#x27;s environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting, and scent-based special effects.

===20th anniversary===
For the 20th anniversary of the film, &quot;Titanic&quot; was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.

===25th anniversary===
&quot;Titanic&quot; was re-released in theaters by Paramount domestically and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (through the 20th Century Studios and Buena Vista International labels) internationally on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D 4K HDR render, with high frame rate, as part of the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary. For this version, the international prints update 20th Century&#x27;s logo with the studio&#x27;s current name, as a result of Disney&#x27;s 2019 acquisition of the studio.

==&quot;Titanic Live&quot;==
&quot;Titanic Live&quot; was a live performance of Horner&#x27;s original score by a 130-piece orchestra, choir and Celtic musicians, accompanying a showing of the film. In April 2015, &quot;Titanic Live&quot; premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where the 2012 3D re-release had premiered.

==Other media==
* In 1998, an official tie-in computer game was released, titled &quot;James Cameron&#x27;s Titanic Explorer&quot;. The educational game covered the history of the vessel&#x27;s construction, maiden voyage and sinking, as well as the discovery and exploration of the wreck. The game included deleted footage from the film and extensive 360-degree video footage of the film&#x27;s sets.

<text>Center-pivot irrigation (sometimes called central pivot irrigation), also called water-wheel and circle irrigation, is a method of crop irrigation in which equipment rotates around a pivot and crops are watered with sprinklers. A circular area centered on the pivot is irrigated, often creating a circular pattern in crops when viewed from above (sometimes referred to as &quot;crop circles&quot;, not to be confused with those formed by circular flattening of a section of a crop in a field). Most center pivots were initially water-powered, however today most are propelled by electric motors. 

Center-pivot irrigation systems are beneficial due to their ability to efficiently use water and optimize a farm&#x27;s yield. The systems are highly effective on large land fields. 

==History==
On March 23, 1914 James A. Norton of Odebolt, Iowa, filed the patent for the center pivot irrigation system. On August 17, 1915, it was granted as patent #1150144. The patent drawings shows multiple pairs of wheels supporting a pipe that is moved in a circle around a center pivot point. The description is: Watering arrangements making use of movable installations on wheels or the like movable around a pivot centre.

Center-pivot irrigation was invented in 1940 by the farmer Frank Zybach, who lived in Strasburg, Colorado. It is recognized as an effective method to improve water distribution to fields.

In 1952, Zybach went into business with A. E. Trowbridge, a friend, Ethan James Olson, from Columbus, Nebraska. Trowbridge put up $25,000 () and got 49% of the patent rights. Zybach moved back from Colorado to Columbus, opened a shop, hired a few men, moved the height of the pipe up to , and went into business. In the first two years of operation, they sold only 19 systems. The early designs were finicky and few farmers understood the systems. Zybach kept improving his designs and focused on making his machines better, rather than attempting to sell systems with problems.

Zybach saw success with modified designs, which improved the systems operational efficiency. In 1954, he licensed his patent to Robert Daugherty and his company, Valley Manufacturing. Daugherty&#x27;s engineers spent the next decade refining Zybach&#x27;s innovation, making it sturdier, taller, and more reliable, and converting it from a hydraulic power system to electric drive. Daugherty&#x27;s company went on to grow into Valmont Industries, with Valley Irrigation being its subsidiary.

==Overview== 
Center pivot irrigation is a form of overhead sprinkler irrigation consisting of several segments of pipe (usually galvanized steel or aluminum) with sprinklers positioned along their length, joined together and supported by trusses, and mounted on wheeled towers. The machine moves in a circular pattern and is fed with water from the pivot point at the center of the circle.

For a center pivot to be used, the terrain needs to be reasonably flat; but one major advantage of center pivots over alternative systems that use gravity flow is the ability to function in undulating country. This advantage has resulted in increased irrigated acreage and water use in some areas. The system is used in parts of the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and in desert areas such as the Sahara and the Middle East.

Center pivots are typically less than in length (circle radius) with the most common size being the standard machine, which covers about of land.
Originally, most center pivots were water-powered. These were replaced by hydraulic systems and electric motor-driven systems, usually driven by a motor mounted at each tower.

The outside set of wheels sets the pace for the rotation. The inner sets of wheels are mounted at hubs between two segments and use angle sensors (microswitches) to detect when the bend at the joint exceeds a certain threshold. When the angle is too large, the wheels rotate to keep the segments aligned. Typical periods for a full rotation include three days; while other sources have the outer edge of the structure moving at per minute, which would equate to 14 to 21 hours for one full rotation of a system.

To achieve uniform application, center pivots require a variable emitter flow rate across the radius of the machine. Since the outer-most spans (or towers) travel farther in a given time period than the innermost spans, nozzle sizes are smallest at the inner spans and increase with distance from the pivot point. Aerial views show fields of circles created by tracings of quarter-mile or half-mile (400 or 800 m) radial irrigation pipes, which consume up to several thousands of gallons per minute.&quot;
Most center pivot systems now have drops hanging from a U-shaped pipe called a &quot;gooseneck&quot; attached at the top of the pipe with sprinkler heads that are positioned a few feet (at most) above the crop, thus limiting evaporative losses and wind drift. There are many different nozzle configurations available including static plate, moving plate and part circle. Pressure regulators are typically installed upstream of each nozzle to ensure each is operating at the correct design pressure.

Drops can also be used with drag hoses or bubblers that deposit the water directly on the ground between crops. This type of system is known as LEPA (Low Energy Precision Application) and is often associated with the construction of small dams along the furrow length (termed furrow diking/dyking). Crops may be planted either in straight rows or in circles to conform to the travel of the irrigation system.

==Linear or lateral move irrigation machines==
Irrigation equipment can also be configured to move in a straight line, where it is termed a &quot;lateral move&quot;, &quot;linear move&quot;, &quot;wheel move&quot; or &quot;side-roll&quot; irrigation system. In these systems the water is supplied by an irrigation channel running the length of the field. The channel is positioned either at one side or in a line through the center. The motor and pump equipment are mounted on a cart by the supply channel. The cart travels with the machine.

Farmers might choose lateral-move irrigation to keep existing rectangular fields. This can help them convert from furrow irrigation. Lateral-move irrigation is far less common, relies on more complex guidance systems, and requires additional management compared to center pivot irrigation. Lateral-move irrigation is common in Australia. There, systems are usually between 500 and 1,000 meters long.

==Benefits==
Center-pivot irrigation uses less labor than many other surface irrigation methods, such as furrow irrigation. It also has lower labor costs than ground-irrigation techniques that require digging of channels. Also, center-pivot irrigation can reduce the amount of soil tillage. Therefore, it helps reduce water runoff and soil erosion that can occur with ground irrigation. Less tillage also encourages more organic materials and crop residue to decompose back into the soil. It also reduces soil compaction.

In the United States early settlers of the semiarid High Plains were plagued by crop failures due to cycles of drought, culminating in the disastrous Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Only after World War II when center pivot irrigation became available did the land mass of the High Plains aquifer system transform into one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world.

==Negative effects==

Groundwater levels decrease when the rate of extraction by irrigation exceeds the rate of recharge. By 2013 it was shown that counterintuitively, as the water consumption efficiency of center-pivot irrigation improved over the years, farmers planted more intensively, irrigated more land, and grew thirstier crops. This is an example of Jevons paradox.

In parts of the United States, sixty years of the profitable business of intensive farming using huge center-pivot irrigators has emptied parts of the Ogallala Aquifer (also known as the High Plains Aquifer). One of the world&#x27;s largest aquifers, it covers an area of approximately in portions of the eight states of South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas, beneath the Great Plains in the United States. The total water extraction from center-pivot irrigation in the area is estimated to be about 5.42 million acre-feet of water per year. 

In 1950, irrigated cropland covered . With the use of center-pivot irrigation, nearly of land were irrigated in Kansas alone. At some places, during maximum extraction, the water table dropped more than per year. In extreme cases, wells had to be greatly deepened to reach the steadily falling water table. In some places in the Texas Panhandle, the water table has been drained (dewatered). &quot;Vast stretches of Texas farmland lying over the aquifer no longer support irrigation. In west-central Kansas, up to a fifth of the irrigated farmland along a swath of the aquifer has already gone dry.&quot; It would take hundreds to thousands of years of rainfall to replace the groundwater in the dried up aquifer.

==Role in culture==
In the 21st century, recognition of the significance of the High Plains Aquifer has led to increased coverage from regional and international journalists. A May 2013 &quot;New York Times&quot; article &quot;Wells dry, fertile plains turn to dust&quot; recounts the relentless decline of parts of the High Plains Aquifer System.

Writer Emily Woodson characterized the increased use of the center pivot irrigation system as part of a profound attitude shift towards modernism (expensive tractors, center-pivot irrigation, dangerous new pesticides) and away from traditional farming that took place in the mid-1970s and 1980s in the United States. A new generation chose high-risk, high-reward crops such as irrigated corn or peanuts, which require large quantities of groundwater, fertilizer and chemicals. The new family farm corporations turned many pastures into new cropland and were more interested in rising land prices than water conservation.

<doc id="52376" wikidata="Q740424" url="?curid=52376" title="Axiom of extensionality">
<text>The axiom of extensionality, also called the axiom of extent, is an axiom used in many forms of axiomatic set theory, such as Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. The axiom defines what a set is. Informally, the axiom means that the two sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are equal if and only if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; have the same members.

== In ZF set theory ==
In the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads:

:formula_1

or in words:
:If the sets formula_2 and formula_3 have the same members, then they are the same set.

In , all members of sets are themselves sets, but not in set theory with urelements. The axiom&#x27;s usefulness can be seen from the fact that, if one accepts that formula_4, where formula_5 is a set and &quot;formula_6&quot; is a formula that formula_2 occurs free in but formula_5 doesn&#x27;t, then the axiom assures that there is a unique set formula_5 whose members are precisely whatever objects (urelements or sets, as the case may be) satisfy the formula &quot;formula_6.&quot;

The converse of the axiom, formula_11, follows from the substitution property of equality. Despite this, the axiom is sometimes given directly as a biconditional, i.e., as formula_12.

== In NF set theory ==
Quine&#x27;s New Foundations (NF) set theory, in Quine&#x27;s original presentations of it, treats the symbol formula_13 for equality or identity as shorthand either for &quot;if a set contains the left side of the equals sign as a member, then it also contains the right side of the equals sign as a member&quot; (as defined in 1937), or for &quot;an object is an element of the set on the left side of the equals sign if, and only if, it is also an element of the set on the right side of the equals sign&quot; (as defined in 1951). That is, formula_14 is treated as shorthand either for formula_15, as in the original 1937 paper, or for formula_16, as in Quine&#x27;s &quot;Mathematical Logic&quot; (1951). The second version of the definition is exactly equivalent to the antecedent of the ZF axiom of extensionality, and the first version of the definition is still very similar to it. By contrast, however, the ZF set theory takes the symbol formula_13 for identity or equality as a primitive symbol of the formal language, and defines the axiom of extensionality in terms of it. (In this paragraph, the statements of both versions of the definition were paraphrases, and quotation marks were only used to set the statements apart.)

In Quine&#x27;s &quot;New Foundations for Mathematical Logic&quot; (1937), the original paper of NF, the name &quot;principle of extensionality&quot; is given to the postulate P1, formula_18, which, for readability, may be restated as formula_19. The definition D8, which defines the symbol formula_13 for identity or equality, defines formula_21 as shorthand for formula_22. In his &quot;Mathematical Logic&quot; (1951), having already developed quasi-quotation, Quine defines formula_23 as shorthand for formula_24 (definition D10), and does not define an axiom or principle &quot;of extensionality&quot; at all.

Thomas Forster, however, ignores these fine distinctions, and considers NF to accept the axiom of extensionality in its ZF form.

== In ZU set theory ==
In the Scott–Potter (ZU) set theory, the &quot;extensionality principle&quot; formula_25 is given as a theorem rather than an axiom, which is proved from the definition of a &quot;collection&quot;.

== In set theory with ur-elements ==

An ur-element is a member of a set that is not itself a set.
In the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, there are no ur-elements, but they are included in some alternative axiomatisations of set theory.
Ur-elements can be treated as a different logical type from sets; in this case, formula_26 makes no sense if formula_5 is an ur-element, so the axiom of extensionality simply applies only to sets.

Alternatively, in untyped logic, we can require formula_26 to be false whenever formula_5 is an ur-element.
In this case, the usual axiom of extensionality would then imply that every ur-element is equal to the empty set.
To avoid this consequence, we can modify the axiom of extensionality to apply only to nonempty sets, so that it reads:

:formula_30

That is:
:Given any set &quot;A&quot; and any set &quot;B&quot;, &quot;if &quot;A&quot; is a nonempty set&quot; (that is, if there exists a member &quot;X&quot; of &quot;A&quot;), &quot;then&quot; if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; have precisely the same members, then they are equal.

Yet another alternative in untyped logic is to define formula_5 itself to be the only element of formula_5
whenever formula_5 is an ur-element. While this approach can serve to preserve the axiom of extensionality, the axiom of regularity will need an adjustment instead.

<text>Thermite () is a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder and metal oxide. When ignited by heat or chemical reaction, thermite undergoes an exothermic reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction. Most varieties are not explosive, but can create brief bursts of heat and high temperature in a small area. Its form of action is similar to that of other fuel-oxidizer mixtures, such as black powder.

Thermites have diverse compositions. Fuels include aluminum, magnesium, titanium, zinc, silicon, and boron. aluminum is common because of its high boiling point and low cost. Oxidizers include bismuth(III) oxide, boron(III) oxide, silicon(IV) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, iron(III) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, copper(II) oxide, and lead(II,IV) oxide. In a thermochemical survey comprising twenty-five metals and thirty-two metal oxides, 288 out of 800 binary combinations were characterized by adiabatic temperatures greater than 2000 K. Combinations like these, which possess the thermodynamic potential to produce very high temperatures, are either already known to be reactive or are plausible thermitic systems.

The first thermite reaction was discovered in 1893 by the German chemist Hans Goldschmidt, who obtained a patent for his process. Today, thermite is used mainly for thermite welding, particularly for welding together railway tracks. Thermites have also been used in metal refining, disabling munitions, and in incendiary weapons. Some thermite-like mixtures are used as pyrotechnic initiators in fireworks.

== Chemical reactions ==

In the following example, elemental aluminum reduces the oxide of another metal, in this common example iron oxide, because aluminum forms stronger and more stable bonds with oxygen than iron:

: Fe2O3 + 2 Al → 2 Fe + Al2O3

The products are aluminum oxide, elemental iron, and a large amount of heat. The reactants are commonly powdered and mixed with a binder to keep the material solid and prevent separation.

Other metal oxides can be used, such as chromium oxide, to generate the given metal in its elemental form. For example, a copper thermite reaction using copper oxide and elemental aluminum can be used for creating electric joints in a process called cadwelding, that produces elemental copper (it may react violently):

: 3 CuO + 2 Al → 3 Cu + Al2O3

Thermites with nanosized particles are described by a variety of terms, such as metastable intermolecular composites, super-thermite, nano-thermite, and nanocomposite energetic materials.

== History ==

The thermite () reaction was discovered in 1893 and patented in 1895 by German chemist Hans Goldschmidt. Consequently, the reaction is sometimes called the &quot;Goldschmidt reaction&quot; or &quot;Goldschmidt process&quot;. Goldschmidt was originally interested in producing very pure metals by avoiding the use of carbon in smelting, but he soon discovered the value of thermite in welding.

The first commercial application of thermite was the welding of tram tracks in Essen in 1899.

== Types ==

Red iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, commonly known as rust) is the most common iron oxide used in thermite. Black iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4, magnetite) also works. Other oxides are occasionally used, such as MnO2 in manganese thermite, Cr2O3 in chromium thermite, SiO2 (quartz) in silicon thermite, or copper(II) oxide in copper thermite, but only for specialized purposes. All of these examples use aluminum as the reactive metal. Fluoropolymers can be used in special formulations, Teflon with magnesium or aluminum being a relatively common example. Magnesium/Teflon/Viton is another pyrolant of this type.

Combinations of dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) and reducing agents such as magnesium, aluminum and boron follow the same chemical reaction as with traditional thermite mixtures, producing metal oxides and carbon. Despite the very low temperature of a dry ice thermite mixture, such a system is capable of being ignited with a flame. When the ingredients are finely divided, confined in a pipe and armed like a traditional explosive, this cryo-thermite is detonatable and a portion of the carbon liberated in the reaction emerges in the form of diamond.

In principle, any reactive metal could be used instead of aluminum. This is rarely done, because the properties of aluminum are nearly ideal for this reaction:

* It forms a passivation layer making it safer to handle than many other reactive metals.
* Its relatively low melting point (660 °C) means that it is easy to melt the metal, so that the reaction can occur mainly in the liquid phase, thus it proceeds fairly quickly.
* Its high boiling point (2519 °C) enables the reaction to reach very high temperatures, since several processes tend to limit the maximum temperature to just below the boiling point. Such a high boiling point is common among transition metals (e.g., iron and copper boil at 2887 and 2582 °C, respectively), but is especially unusual among the highly reactive metals (cf. magnesium and sodium, which boil at 1090 and 883 °C, respectively).
* Further, the low density of the aluminum oxide formed as a result of the reaction tends to leave it floating on the resultant pure metal. This is particularly important for reducing contamination in a weld.

Although the reactants are stable at room temperature, they burn with an extremely intense exothermic reaction when they are heated to ignition temperature. The products emerge as liquids due to the high temperatures reached (up to 2500 °C (4532°F) with iron(III) oxide)—although the actual temperature reached depends on how quickly heat can escape to the surrounding environment. Thermite contains its own supply of oxygen and does not require any external source of air. Consequently, it cannot be smothered, and may ignite in any environment given sufficient initial heat. It burns well while wet, and cannot be easily extinguished with water—though enough water to remove sufficient heat may stop the reaction. Small amounts of water boil before reaching the reaction. Even so, thermite is used for welding under water.

The thermites are characterized by almost complete absence of gas production during burning, high reaction temperature, and production of molten slag. The fuel should have high heat of combustion and produce oxides with low melting point and high boiling point. The oxidizer should contain at least 25% oxygen, have high density, low heat of formation, and produce metal with low melting and high boiling points (so the energy released is not consumed in evaporation of reaction products). Organic binders can be added to the composition to improve its mechanical properties, but they tend to produce endothermic decomposition products, causing some loss of reaction heat and production of gases.

The temperature achieved during the reaction determines the outcome. In an ideal case, the reaction produces a well-separated melt of metal and slag. For this, the temperature must be high enough to melt both reaction products, the resulting metal and the fuel oxide. Too low a temperature produces a mixture of sintered metal and slag; too high a temperature (above the boiling point of any reactant or product) leads to rapid production of gas, dispersing the burning reaction mixture, sometimes with effects similar to a low-yield explosion. In compositions intended for production of metal by aluminothermic reaction, these effects can be counteracted. Too low a reaction temperature (e.g., when producing silicon from sand) can be boosted with addition of a suitable oxidizer (e.g., sulfur in aluminum-sulfur-sand compositions); too high a temperature can be reduced by using a suitable coolant or slag flux. The flux often used in amateur compositions is calcium fluoride, as it reacts only minimally, has relatively low melting point, low melt viscosity at high temperatures (therefore increasing fluidity of the slag) and forms a eutectic with alumina. Too much flux, however, dilutes the reactants to the point of not being able to sustain combustion. The type of metal oxide also has dramatic influence to the amount of energy produced; the higher the oxide, the higher the amount of energy produced. A good example is the difference between manganese(IV) oxide and manganese(II) oxide, where the former produces too high temperature and the latter is barely able to sustain combustion; to achieve good results, a mixture with proper ratio of both oxides can be used.

The reaction rate can be also tuned with particle sizes; coarser particles burn slower than finer particles. The effect is more pronounced with the particles requiring heating to higher temperature to start reacting. This effect is pushed to the extreme with nano-thermites.

The temperature achieved in the reaction in adiabatic conditions, when no heat is lost to the environment, can be estimated using Hess’s law – by calculating the energy produced by the reaction itself (subtracting the enthalpy of the reactants from the enthalpy of the products) and subtracting the energy consumed by heating the products (from their specific heat, when the materials only change their temperature, and their enthalpy of fusion and eventually enthalpy of vaporization, when the materials melt or boil). In real conditions, the reaction loses heat to the environment, the achieved temperature is therefore somewhat lower. The heat transfer rate is finite, so the faster the reaction is, the closer to adiabatic condition it runs and the higher is the achieved temperature.

=== Iron thermite ===
The most common composition is iron thermite. The oxidizer used is usually either iron(III) oxide or iron(II,III) oxide. The former produces more heat. The latter is easier to ignite, likely due to the crystal structure of the oxide. Addition of copper or manganese oxides can significantly improve the ease of ignition.
The density of prepared thermite is often as low as 0.7 g/cm3. This, in turn, results in relatively poor energy density (about 3 kJ/cm3), rapid burn times, and spray of molten iron due to the expansion of trapped air. Thermite can be pressed to densities as high as 4.9 g/cm3 (almost 16 kJ/cm3) with slow burning speeds (about 1 cm/s). Pressed thermite has higher melting power, i.e. it can melt a steel cup where a low-density thermite would fail. Iron thermite with or without additives can be pressed into cutting devices that have heat-resistant casing and a nozzle.
Oxygen-balanced iron thermite 2Al + Fe2O3 has theoretical maximum density of 4.175 g/cm3 an adiabatic burn temperature of 3135 K or 2862 °C or 5183 °F (with phase transitions included, limited by iron, which boils at 3135 K), the aluminum oxide is (briefly) molten and the produced iron is mostly liquid with part of it being in gaseous form - 78.4 g of iron vapor per kg of thermite are produced. The energy content is 945.4 cal/g (3 956 J/g). The energy density is 16,516 J/cm3.

The original mixture, as invented, used iron oxide in the form of mill scale. The composition was very difficult to ignite.

=== Copper thermite ===
Copper thermite can be prepared using either copper(I) oxide (Cu2O, red) or copper(II) oxide (CuO, black). The burn rate tends to be very fast and the melting point of copper is relatively low, so the reaction produces a significant amount of molten copper in a very short time. Copper(II) thermite reactions can be so fast that it can be considered a type of flash powder. An explosion can occur, which sends a spray of copper drops to considerable distances.
Oxygen-balanced mixture has theoretical maximum density of 5.109 g/cm3, adiabatic flame temperature 2843 K (phase transitions included) with the aluminum oxide being molten and copper in both liquid and gaseous form; 343 g of copper vapor per kg of this thermite are produced. The energy content is 974 cal/g.

Copper(I) thermite has industrial uses in e.g., welding of thick copper conductors (cadwelding). This kind of welding is being evaluated also for cable splicing on the US Navy fleet, for use in high-current systems, e.g., electric propulsion.
Oxygen-balanced mixture has theoretical maximum density of 5.280 g/cm3, adiabatic flame temperature 2843 K (phase transitions included) with the aluminum oxide being molten and copper in both liquid and gaseous form; 77.6 g of copper vapor per kg of this thermite are produced. The energy content is 575.5 cal/g.

=== Thermates ===

Thermate composition is a thermite enriched with a salt-based oxidizer (usually nitrates, e.g., barium nitrate, or peroxides). In contrast with thermites, thermates burn with evolution of flame and gases. The presence of the oxidizer makes the mixture easier to ignite and improves penetration of target by the burning composition, as the evolved gas is projecting the molten slag and providing mechanical agitation. This mechanism makes thermate more suitable than thermite for incendiary purposes and for emergency destruction of sensitive equipment (e.g., cryptographic devices), as thermite&#x27;s effect is more localized.

== Ignition ==

Metals, under the right conditions, burn in a process similar to the combustion of wood or gasoline. In fact, rust is the result of oxidation of steel or iron at very slow rates. A thermite reaction results when the correct mixtures of metallic fuels combine and ignite. Ignition itself requires extremely high temperatures.

Ignition of a thermite reaction normally requires a sparkler or easily obtainable magnesium ribbon, but may require persistent efforts, as ignition can be unreliable and unpredictable. These temperatures cannot be reached with conventional black powder fuses, nitrocellulose rods, detonators, pyrotechnic initiators, or other common igniting substances. Even when the thermite is hot enough to glow bright red, it does not ignite, as it has a very high ignition temperature. Starting the reaction is possible using a propane torch if done correctly.

Often, strips of magnesium metal are used as fuses. Because metals burn without releasing cooling gases, they can potentially burn at extremely high temperatures. Reactive metals such as magnesium can easily reach temperatures sufficiently high for thermite ignition. Magnesium ignition remains popular among amateur thermite users, mainly because it can be easily obtained, but a piece of the burning strip can fall off into the mixture, resulting in premature ignition.

The reaction between potassium permanganate and glycerol or ethylene glycol is used as an alternative to the magnesium method. When these two substances mix, a spontaneous reaction begins, slowly increasing the temperature of the mixture until it produces flames. The heat released by the oxidation of glycerine is sufficient to initiate a thermite reaction.

Apart from magnesium ignition, some amateurs also choose to use sparklers to ignite the thermite mixture. These reach the necessary temperatures and provide enough time before the burning point reaches the sample. This can be a dangerous method, as the iron sparks, like the magnesium strips, burn at thousands of degrees and can ignite the thermite, though the sparkler itself is not in contact with it. This is especially dangerous with finely powdered thermite.

Match heads burn hot enough to ignite thermite. Use of match heads enveloped with aluminum foil and a sufficiently long viscofuse/electric match leading to the match heads is possible.

Similarly, finely powdered thermite can be ignited by a flint spark lighter, as the sparks are burning metal (in this case, the highly reactive rare-earth metals lanthanum and cerium). Therefore, it is unsafe to strike a lighter close to thermite.

== Civilian uses ==

Thermite reactions have many uses. It is not an explosive; instead, it operates by exposing a very small area to extremely high temperatures. Intense heat focused on a small spot can be used to cut through metal or weld metal components together both by melting metal from the components, and by injecting molten metal from the thermite reaction itself. 

Thermite may be used for repair by the welding in-place of thick steel sections such as locomotive axle-frames where the repair can take place without removing the part from its installed location.

Thermite can be used for quickly cutting or welding steel such as rail tracks, without requiring complex or heavy equipment. However, defects such as slag inclusions and voids (holes) are often present in such welded junctions, so great care is needed to operate the process successfully. The numerical analysis of thermite welding of rails has been approached similar to casting cooling analysis. Both this finite element analysis and experimental analysis of thermite rail welds has shown that weld gap is the most influential parameter affecting defect formation. Increasing weld gap has been shown to reduce shrinkage cavity formation and cold lap welding defects, and increasing preheat and thermite temperature further reduces these defects. However, reducing these defects promotes a second form of defect: microporosity. Care must also be taken to ensure that the rails remain straight, without resulting in dipped joints, which can cause wear on high speed and heavy axle load lines. Studies to make the hardness of thermite welds to repair tracks have made improvements to the hardness to compare more to the original tracks while keeping its portable nature.

As the reaction of thermite is oxidation-reduction and environmentally friendly, it has started to be adapted into use for sealing oil wells instead of using concrete. Though thermite is usually in a powder-state, a diluted mixture can reduce damage to the surroundings during the process, though too much alumina can risk hurting the integrity of the seal. A higher concentration of mixture was needed to melt the plastic of a model tube, making it a favorable mixture. Other experiments have been done to simulate the heat flux of the well sealing to predict the temperature on the surface of the seal over time.

A thermite reaction, when used to purify the ores of some metals, is called the , or aluminothermic reaction. An adaptation of the reaction, used to obtain pure uranium, was developed as part of the Manhattan Project at Ames Laboratory under the direction of Frank Spedding. It is sometimes called the Ames process.

Copper thermite is used for welding together thick copper wires for the purpose of electrical connections. It is used extensively by the electrical utilities and telecommunications industries (exothermic welded connections).

== Military uses ==
Thermite hand grenades and charges are typically used by armed forces in both an anti-materiel role and in the partial destruction of equipment, the latter being common when time is not available for safer or more thorough methods. For example, thermite can be used for the emergency destruction of cryptographic equipment when there is a danger that it might be captured by enemy troops. Because standard iron-thermite is difficult to ignite, burns with practically no flame and has a small radius of action, standard thermite is rarely used on its own as an incendiary composition. In general, an increase in the volume of gaseous reaction products of a thermite blend increases the heat transfer rate (and therefore damage) of that particular thermite blend. It is usually used with other ingredients that increase its incendiary effects. Thermate-TH3 is a mixture of thermite and pyrotechnic additives that have been found superior to standard thermite for incendiary purposes. Its composition by weight is generally about 68.7% thermite, 29.0% barium nitrate, 2.0% sulfur, and 0.3% of a binder (such as PBAN). The addition of barium nitrate to thermite increases its thermal effect, produces a larger flame, and significantly reduces the ignition temperature. Although the primary purpose of Thermate-TH3 by the armed forces is as an incendiary anti-materiel weapon, it also has uses in welding together metal components.

A classic military use for thermite is disabling artillery pieces, and it has been used for this purpose since World War II, such as at Pointe du Hoc, Normandy. Because it permanently disables artillery pieces without the use of explosive charges, thermite can be used when silence is necessary to an operation. This can be accomplished by inserting one or more armed thermite grenades into the breech, then quickly closing it; this welds the breech shut and makes loading the weapon impossible.

During World War II, both German and Allied incendiary bombs used thermite mixtures. Incendiary bombs usually consisted of dozens of thin, thermite-filled canisters (bomblets) ignited by a magnesium fuse. Incendiary bombs created massive damage in numerous cities due to the fires started by the thermite. Cities that primarily consisted of wooden buildings were especially susceptible. These incendiary bombs were used primarily during nighttime air raids. Bombsights could not be used at night, creating the need for munitions that could destroy targets without requiring precision placement.

So called Dragon drones equipped with thermite munitions were used by the Ukrainian army during the Russian invasion of Ukraine against Russian positions.

== Hazards ==

Thermite usage is hazardous due to the extremely high temperatures produced and the extreme difficulty in smothering a reaction once initiated. Small streams of molten iron released in the reaction can travel considerable distances and may melt through metal containers, igniting their contents. Additionally, flammable metals with relatively low boiling points such as zinc (with a boiling point of 907 °C, which is about 1,370 °C below the temperature at which thermite burns) could potentially spray superheated boiling metal violently into the air if near a thermite reaction.

If, for some reason, thermite is contaminated with organics, hydrated oxides and other compounds able to produce gases upon heating or reaction with thermite components, the reaction products may be sprayed. Moreover, if the thermite mixture contains enough empty spaces with air and burns fast enough, the super-heated air also may cause the mixture to spray. For this reason it is preferable to use relatively crude powders, so the reaction rate is moderate and hot gases could escape the reaction zone.

Preheating of thermite before ignition can easily be done accidentally, for example by pouring a new pile of thermite over a hot, recently ignited pile of thermite slag. When ignited, preheated thermite can burn almost instantaneously, releasing light and heat energy at a much higher rate than normal and causing burns and eye damage at what would normally be a reasonably safe distance.

The thermite reaction can take place accidentally in industrial locations where workers use abrasive grinding and cutting wheels with ferrous metals. Using aluminum in this situation produces a mixture of oxides that can explode violently.

Mixing water with thermite or pouring water onto burning thermite can cause a steam explosion, spraying hot fragments in all directions.

Thermite&#x27;s main ingredients were also utilized for their individual qualities, specifically reflectivity and heat insulation, in a paint coating or dope for the German zeppelin &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, possibly contributing to its fiery destruction. This was a theory put forward by the former NASA scientist Addison Bain, and later tested in small scale by the scientific reality-TV show &quot;MythBusters&quot; with semi-inconclusive results (it was proven not to be the fault of the thermite reaction alone, but instead conjectured to be a combination of that and the burning of hydrogen gas that filled the body of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;). The &quot;MythBusters&quot; program also tested the veracity of a video found on the Internet, whereby a quantity of thermite in a metal bucket was ignited while sitting on top of several blocks of ice, causing a sudden explosion. They were able to confirm the results, finding huge chunks of ice as far as 50 m from the point of explosion. Co-host Jamie Hyneman conjectured that this was due to the thermite mixture aerosolizing, perhaps in a cloud of steam, causing it to burn even faster. Hyneman also voiced skepticism about another theory explaining the phenomenon: that the reaction somehow separated the hydrogen and oxygen in the ice and then ignited them. This explanation claims that the explosion is due to the reaction of high temperature molten aluminum with water. aluminum reacts violently with water or steam at high temperatures, releasing hydrogen and oxidizing in the process. The speed of that reaction and the ignition of the resulting hydrogen can easily account for the explosion verified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aluminum Times Vol 11 n 3 Jul/Aug 2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This process is akin to the explosive reaction caused by dropping metallic potassium into water.

<doc id="52382" wikidata="Q42761" url="?curid=52382" title="Watergate scandal">
<text>The Watergate scandal was a major political scandal in the United States involving the administration of President Richard Nixon which began in 1972 and ultimately led to Nixon&#x27;s resignation in 1974. It revolved around members of a group associated with Nixon&#x27;s 1972 re-election campaign breaking into and planting listening devices in the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Office Building in Washington, D.C., on June 17, 1972, and Nixon&#x27;s later attempts to hide his administration&#x27;s involvement.

Following the arrest of the burglars, both the press and the Department of Justice connected the money found on those involved to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP), the fundraising arm of Nixon&#x27;s campaign. Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, journalists from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, pursued leads provided by a source they called &quot;Deep Throat&quot; (later identified as Mark Felt, associate director of the FBI) and uncovered a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage directed by White House officials and illegally funded by donor contributions. Nixon dismissed the accusations as political smears, and he won the election in a landslide in November. Further investigation and revelations from the burglars&#x27; trial led the Senate to establish a special Watergate Committee and the House of Representatives to grant its Judiciary Committee expanded authority in February 1973. The burglars received lengthy prison sentences that they were told would be reduced if they co-operated, which began a flood of testimony from witnesses. In April, Nixon appeared on television to deny wrongdoing on his part and to announce the resignation of his aides. After it was revealed that Nixon had installed a voice-activated taping system in the Oval Office, his administration refused to grant investigators access to the tapes, leading to a constitutional crisis. The televised Senate Watergate hearings by this point had garnered nationwide attention and public interest.

Attorney General Elliot Richardson appointed Archibald Cox as a special prosecutor for Watergate in May. Cox obtained a subpoena for the tapes, but Nixon continued to resist. In the &quot;Saturday Night Massacre&quot; in October, Nixon ordered Richardson to fire Cox, after which Richardson resigned, as did his deputy William Ruckelshaus; Solicitor General Robert Bork carried out the order. The incident bolstered a growing public belief that Nixon had something to hide, but he continued to defend his innocence and said he was &quot;not a crook&quot;. In April 1974, Cox&#x27;s replacement Leon Jaworski issued a subpoena for the tapes again, but Nixon only released edited transcripts of them. In July, the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to release the tapes, and the House Judiciary Committee recommended that he be impeached for obstructing justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. In one of the tapes, later known as &quot;the smoking gun&quot;, he ordered aides to tell the FBI to halt its investigation. On the verge of being impeached, Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, becoming the only U.S. president to do so. In all, 48 people were found guilty of Watergate-related crimes, but Nixon was pardoned by his vice president and successor Gerald Ford on September 8.

Public response to the Watergate disclosures had electoral ramifications: the Republican Party lost four seats in the Senate and 48 seats in the House at the 1974 mid-term elections, and Ford&#x27;s pardon of Nixon is widely agreed to have contributed to his election defeat in 1976. A word combined with the suffix &quot;-gate&quot; has become widely used to name scandals, even outside the U.S., and especially in politics.

== Wiretapping of the Democratic Party&#x27;s headquarters ==


On January 27, 1972, G. Gordon Liddy, Finance Counsel for the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP) and former aide to John Ehrlichman, presented a campaign intelligence plan to CRP&#x27;s acting chairman Jeb Stuart Magruder, Attorney General John Mitchell, and Presidential Counsel John Dean. The plot involved extensive illegal activities against the Democratic Party. According to Dean, this marked &quot;the opening scene of the worst political scandal of the twentieth century and the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency&quot;.

Mitchell viewed the plan as unrealistic. Two months later, Mitchell approved a reduced version of the plan, which included burglarizing the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate Complex in Washington, D.C. to photograph campaign documents and install listening devices in telephones. Liddy has since insisted that he was duped by both Dean and at least two of his subordinates. This included former CIA officers E. Howard Hunt and James McCord, the latter of whom was serving as then-CRP Security Coordinator after John Mitchell resigned as attorney general to become the CRP chairman.

In May, McCord assigned former FBI agent Alfred C. Baldwin III to carry out the wiretapping and monitor the telephone conversations afterward.

On May 11, McCord arranged for Baldwin, whom investigative reporter Jim Hougan described as &quot;somehow special and perhaps well known to McCord&quot;, to stay at the Howard Johnson&#x27;s motel across the street from the Watergate complex. Room 419 was booked in the name of McCord&#x27;s company. At the behest of Liddy and Hunt, McCord and his team of burglars prepared for their first Watergate break-in, which began on May 28.

Two phones inside the DNC headquarters offices were said to have been wiretapped. One was Robert Spencer Oliver&#x27;s phone. At the time, Oliver was working as the executive director of the Association of State Democratic Chairmen. The other phone belonged to DNC chairman Larry O&#x27;Brien. The FBI found no evidence that O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s phone was bugged; however, it was determined that an effective listening device was installed in Oliver&#x27;s phone. While successful with installing the listening devices, the committee agents soon determined that they needed repairs. They plotted a second &quot;burglary&quot; to take care of the situation.

Sometime after midnight on Saturday, June 17, 1972, Watergate Complex security guard Frank Wills noticed tape covering the latches on some of the complex&#x27;s doors leading from the underground parking garage to several offices, which allowed the doors to close but stay unlocked. He removed the tape, believing it was not in itself suspicious. When he returned a short time later and discovered that someone had re-taped the locks, he called the police.

Police dispatched an unmarked police car with three plainclothes officers, Sgt. Paul W. Leeper, Officer John B. Barrett, and Officer Carl M. Shoffler, who were working the overnight shift; they were often referred to as the &quot;bum squad&quot; because they often dressed undercover as hippies and were on the lookout for drug deals and other street crimes. Alfred Baldwin, on &quot;spotter&quot; duty at the Howard Johnson&#x27;s hotel across the street, was distracted watching the film &quot;Attack of the Puppet People&quot; on TV and did not observe the arrival of the police car in front of the Watergate building, nor did he see the plainclothes officers investigating the DNC&#x27;s sixth floor suite of 29 offices. By the time Baldwin finally noticed unusual activity on the sixth floor and radioed the burglars, it was already too late.

The police apprehended five men, later identified as Virgilio Gonzalez, Bernard Barker, James McCord, Eugenio Martínez, and Frank Sturgis. They were criminally charged with attempted burglary and attempted interception of telephone and other communications. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported the day after the burglary that, &quot;police found lock-picks and door jimmies, almost $2,300 in cash, most of it in $100 bills with the serial numbers in sequence... a shortwave receiver that could pick up police calls, 40 rolls of unexposed film, two 35-millimeter cameras and three pen-sized tear gas guns&quot;. The Post would later report that the actual amount of cash was $5,300.

The following morning, Sunday, June 18, G. Gordon Liddy called Jeb Magruder in Los Angeles and informed him that &quot;the four men arrested with McCord were Cuban freedom fighters, whom Howard Hunt recruited&quot;. Initially, Nixon&#x27;s organization and the White House quickly went to work to cover up the crime and any evidence that might have damaged the president and his reelection.

On September 15, 1972, a grand jury indicted the five office burglars, as well as Hunt and Liddy, for conspiracy, burglary, and violation of federal wiretapping laws. The burglars were tried by a jury, with Judge John Sirica officiating, and pled guilty or were convicted on January 30, 1973.

=== Initial cover-up ===
Within hours of the burglars&#x27; arrests, the FBI discovered E. Howard Hunt&#x27;s name in Barker and Martínez&#x27;s address books. Nixon administration officials were concerned because Hunt and Liddy were also involved in a separate secret activity known as the &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;, which was established to stop security &quot;leaks&quot; and investigate other sensitive security matters. Dean later testified that top Nixon aide John Ehrlichman ordered him to &quot;&quot; the contents of Howard Hunt&#x27;s White House safe. Ehrlichman subsequently denied this. In the end, Dean and L. Patrick Gray, the FBI&#x27;s acting director, (in separate operations) destroyed the evidence from Hunt&#x27;s safe.

Nixon&#x27;s own reaction to the break-in, at least initially, was one of skepticism. Watergate prosecutor James Neal was sure that Nixon had not known in advance of the break-in. As evidence, he cited a conversation taped on June 23 between the President and his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, in which Nixon asked, &quot;Who was the asshole that did that?&quot; However, Nixon subsequently ordered Haldeman to have the CIA block the FBI&#x27;s investigation into the source of the funding for the burglary.

A few days later, Nixon&#x27;s press secretary, Ron Ziegler, described the event as &quot;a third-rate burglary attempt&quot;. On August 29, at a news conference, Nixon stated that Dean had conducted a thorough investigation of the incident, when Dean had actually not conducted any investigations at all. Nixon furthermore said, &quot;I can say categorically that ... no one in the White House staff, no one in this Administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident.&quot; On September 15, Nixon congratulated Dean, saying, &quot;The way you&#x27;ve handled it, it seems to me, has been very skillful, because you—putting your fingers in the dikes every time that leaks have sprung here and sprung there.&quot;

=== Kidnapping of Martha Mitchell ===
Martha Mitchell was the wife of Nixon&#x27;s Attorney General, John N. Mitchell, who had recently resigned his role so that he could become campaign manager for Nixon&#x27;s Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP). John Mitchell was aware that Martha knew McCord, one of the Watergate burglars who had been arrested, and that upon finding out, she was likely to speak to the media. In his opinion, her knowing McCord was likely to link the Watergate burglary to Nixon. John Mitchell instructed guards in her security detail not to let her contact the media.

In June 1972, during a phone call with United Press International reporter Helen Thomas, Martha Mitchell informed Thomas that she was leaving her husband until he resigned from the CRP. The phone call ended abruptly. A few days later, Marcia Kramer, a veteran crime reporter of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, tracked Mitchell to the Westchester Country Club in Rye, New York, and described Mitchell as &quot;a beaten woman&quot; with visible bruises. Mitchell reported that, during the week following the Watergate burglary, she had been held captive in a hotel in California, and that security guard Steve King ended her call to Thomas by pulling the phone cord from the wall. Mitchell made several attempts to escape via the balcony, but was physically accosted, injured, and forcefully sedated by a psychiatrist. Following conviction for his role in the Watergate burglary, in February 1975, McCord admitted that Mitchell had been &quot;basically kidnapped&quot;, and corroborated her reports of the event.

=== Money trail ===
On June 19, 1972, the press reported that one of the Watergate burglars was a Republican Party security aide. Former attorney general John Mitchell, who was then the head of the CRP, denied any involvement with the Watergate break-in. He also disavowed any knowledge whatsoever of the five burglars. On August 1, a $25,000 (approximately $ in dollars) cashier&#x27;s check was found to have been deposited in the US and Mexican bank accounts of one of the Watergate burglars, Bernard Barker. Made out to the finance committee of the Committee to Reelect the President, the check was a 1972 campaign donation by Kenneth H. Dahlberg. This money (and several other checks which had been lawfully donated to the CRP) had been directly used to finance the burglary and wiretapping expenses, including hardware and supplies.

Barker&#x27;s multiple national and international businesses all had separate bank accounts, which he was found to have attempted to use to disguise the true origin of the money being paid to the burglars. The donor&#x27;s checks demonstrated the burglars&#x27; direct link to the finance committee of the CRP.

Donations totaling $86,000 ($ today) were made by individuals who believed they were making private donations by certified and cashier&#x27;s checks for the president&#x27;s re-election. Investigators&#x27; examination of the bank records of a Miami company run by Watergate burglar Barker revealed an account controlled by him personally had deposited a check and then transferred it through the Federal Reserve Check Clearing System.

The investigation by the FBI, which cleared Barker&#x27;s bank of fiduciary malfeasance, led to the direct implication of members of the CRP, to whom the checks had been delivered. Those individuals were the committee bookkeeper and its treasurer, Hugh Sloan.

As a private organization, the committee followed the normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individuals to accept and endorse checks on behalf of the committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker&#x27;s bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the finance committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed to do that. When confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that committee deputy director Jeb Magruder and finance director Maurice Stans had directed him to give the money to G. Gordon Liddy.

Liddy, in turn, gave the money to Barker and attempted to hide its origin. Barker tried to disguise the funds by depositing them into accounts in banks outside of the United States. Unbeknownst to Barker, Liddy, and Sloan, the complete record of all such transactions was held for roughly six months. Barker&#x27;s use of foreign banks in April and May 1972 to deposit checks and withdraw the funds via cashier&#x27;s checks and money orders, resulted in the banks keeping the entire transaction records until October and November 1972.

All five Watergate burglars were directly or indirectly tied to the 1972 CRP, thus causing Judge Sirica to suspect a conspiracy involving higher-echelon government officials.

On September 29, 1972, the press reported that John Mitchell, while serving as attorney general, controlled a secret Republican fund used to finance intelligence-gathering against the Democrats. On October 10, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the FBI had determined that the Watergate break-in was part of a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage on behalf of the Nixon re-election committee. Despite these revelations, Nixon&#x27;s campaign was never seriously jeopardized; on November 7, the President was re-elected in one of the biggest landslides in American political history.

=== Role of the media ===
The connection between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political and legal repercussions. Relying heavily upon anonymous sources, &quot;Post&quot; reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts to cover it up, led deeply into the upper reaches of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House. Woodward and Bernstein interviewed Judy Hoback Miller, the bookkeeper for Nixon&#x27;s re-election campaign, who revealed to them information about the mishandling of funds and records being destroyed.

Chief among the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; anonymous sources was an individual whom Woodward and Bernstein had nicknamed Deep Throat; 33 years later, in 2005, the informant was identified as Mark Felt, deputy director of the FBI during that period of the 1970s, something Woodward later confirmed. Felt met secretly with Woodward several times, telling him of Howard Hunt&#x27;s involvement with the Watergate break-in, and that the White House staff regarded the stakes in Watergate as extremely high. Felt warned Woodward that the FBI wanted to know where he and other reporters were getting their information, as they were uncovering a wider web of crimes than the FBI first disclosed. All the secret meetings between Woodward and Felt took place at an underground parking garage in Rosslyn over a period from June 1972 to January 1973. Prior to resigning from the FBI on June 22, 1973, Felt also anonymously planted leaks about Watergate with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot; and other publications.

During this early period, most of the media failed to understand the full implications of the scandal, and concentrated reporting on other topics related to the 1972 presidential election. Most outlets ignored or downplayed Woodward and Bernstein&#x27;s scoops; the crosstown &quot;Washington Star-News&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; even ran stories incorrectly discrediting the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; articles. After the &quot;Post&quot; revealed that H.R. Haldeman had made payments from the secret fund, newspapers like the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; failed to publish the information, but did publish the White House&#x27;s denial of the story the following day. The White House also sought to isolate the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; coverage by tirelessly attacking that newspaper while declining to criticize other damaging stories about the scandal from the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

After it was learned that one of the convicted burglars had written to Judge Sirica alleging a high-level cover-up, the media shifted its focus. &quot;Time&quot; magazine described Nixon as undergoing &quot;daily hell and very little trust&quot;. The distrust between the press and the Nixon administration was mutual and greater than usual due to lingering dissatisfaction with events from the Vietnam War. At the same time, public distrust of the media was polled at more than 40%.

Nixon and top administration officials discussed using government agencies to &quot;get&quot; (or retaliate against) those they perceived as hostile media organizations. Such actions had been taken before. At the request of Nixon&#x27;s White House in 1969, the FBI tapped the phones of five reporters. In 1971, the White House requested an audit of the tax return of the editor of &quot;Newsday&quot;, after he wrote a series of articles about the financial dealings of Charles &quot;Bebe&quot; Rebozo, a friend of Nixon.

The administration and its supporters accused the media of making &quot;wild accusations&quot;, putting too much emphasis on the story and of having a liberal bias against the administration. Nixon said in a May 1974 interview with supporter Baruch Korff that if he had followed the liberal policies that he thought the media preferred, &quot;Watergate would have been a blip.&quot; The media noted that most of the reporting turned out to be accurate; the competitive nature of the media guaranteed widespread coverage of the far-reaching political scandal.

=== Scandal escalates ===
Rather than ending with the conviction and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, the investigation into the break-in and the Nixon Administration&#x27;s involvement grew broader. &quot;Nixon&#x27;s conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed that not only did he know he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but he had to do so in a way that was least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974.&quot; On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar James McCord, who alleged that perjury had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. In an attempt to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.

Urged by Nixon, on March 28, aide John Ehrlichman told Attorney General Richard Kleindienst that nobody in the White House had had prior knowledge of the burglary. On April 13, Magruder told U.S. attorneys that he had perjured himself during the burglars&#x27; trial, and implicated John Dean and John Mitchell.

John Dean believed that he, Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and Haldeman could go to the prosecutors, tell the truth, and save the presidency. Dean wanted to protect the president and have his four closest men take the fall for telling the truth. During the critical meeting between Dean and Nixon on April 15, 1973, Dean was totally unaware of the president&#x27;s depth of knowledge and involvement in the Watergate cover-up. It was during this meeting that Dean felt that he was being recorded. He wondered if this was due to the way Nixon was speaking, as if he were trying to prod attendees&#x27; recollections of earlier conversations about fundraising. Dean mentioned this observation while testifying to the Senate Committee on Watergate, exposing the thread of what were taped conversations that would unravel the fabric of the conspiracy.

Two days later, Dean told Nixon that he had been cooperating with the U.S. attorneys. On that same day, U.S. attorneys told Nixon that Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean, and other White House officials were implicated in the cover-up.

On April 30, Nixon asked for the resignation of Haldeman and Ehrlichman, two of his most influential aides. They were both later indicted, convicted, and ultimately sentenced to prison. He asked for the resignation of Attorney General Kleindienst, to ensure no one could claim that his innocent friendship with Haldeman and Ehrlichman could be construed as a conflict. He fired White House Counsel John Dean, who went on to testify before the Senate Watergate Committee and said that he believed and suspected the conversations in the Oval Office were being taped. This information became the bombshell that helped force Richard Nixon to resign rather than be impeached.

Writing from prison for &quot;New West&quot; and &quot;New York&quot; magazines in 1977, Ehrlichman claimed Nixon had offered him a large sum of money, which he declined.

The President announced the resignations in an address to the American people:

On the same day, April 30, Nixon appointed a new attorney general, Elliot Richardson, and gave him authority to designate a special counsel for the Watergate investigation who would be independent of the regular Justice Department hierarchy. In May 1973, Richardson named Archibald Cox to the position.

=== Senate Watergate hearings and revelation of the Watergate tapes ===


On February 7, 1973, the United States Senate voted 77-to-0 to approve 93 and establish a select committee to investigate Watergate, with Sam Ervin named chairman the next day. The hearings held by the Senate committee, in which Dean and other former administration officials testified, were broadcast from May 17 to August 7. The three major networks of the time agreed to take turns covering the hearings live, each network thus maintaining coverage of the hearings every third day, starting with ABC on May 17 and ending with NBC on August 7. An estimated 85% of Americans with television sets tuned into at least one portion of the hearings.

On Friday, July 13, during a preliminary interview, deputy minority counsel Donald Sanders asked White House assistant Alexander Butterfield if there was any type of recording system in the White House. Butterfield said he was reluctant to answer, but finally admitted there was a new system in the White House that automatically recorded everything in the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room and others, as well as Nixon&#x27;s private office in the Old Executive Office Building.

On Monday, July 16, in front of a live, televised audience, chief minority counsel Fred Thompson asked Butterfield whether he was &quot;aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president&quot;. Butterfield&#x27;s revelation of the taping system transformed the Watergate investigation. Cox immediately subpoenaed the tapes, as did the Senate, but Nixon refused to release them, citing his executive privilege as president, and ordered Cox to drop his subpoena. Cox refused.

=== Saturday Night Massacre ===
On October 20, 1973, after Cox, the special prosecutor, refused to drop the subpoena, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire him. Richardson resigned in protest rather than carry out the order. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox, but Ruckelshaus also resigned rather than fire him. Nixon&#x27;s search for someone in the Justice Department willing to fire Cox ended with Solicitor General Robert Bork. Though Bork said he believed Nixon&#x27;s order was valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being &quot;perceived as a man who did the President&#x27;s bidding to save my job&quot;. Bork carried out the presidential order and dismissed the special prosecutor.

These actions met considerable public criticism. Responding to the allegations of possible wrongdoing, in front of 400 Associated Press managing editors at Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort, on November 17, 1973, Nixon emphatically stated, &quot;Well, I am not a crook.&quot; He needed to allow Bork to appoint a new special prosecutor; Bork, with Nixon&#x27;s approval, chose Leon Jaworski to continue the investigation.

=== Legal action against Nixon administration members ===
On March 1, 1974, a grand jury in Washington, D.C., indicted several former aides of Nixon, who became known as the &quot;Watergate Seven&quot;—H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, John N. Mitchell, Charles Colson, Gordon C. Strachan, Robert Mardian, and Kenneth Parkinson—for conspiring to hinder the Watergate investigation. The grand jury secretly named Nixon as an unindicted co-conspirator. The special prosecutor dissuaded them from an indictment of Nixon, arguing that a president can be indicted only after he leaves office. John Dean, Jeb Stuart Magruder, and other figures had already pleaded guilty. On April 5, 1974, Dwight Chapin, the former Nixon appointments secretary, was convicted of lying to the grand jury. Two days later, the same grand jury indicted Ed Reinecke, the Republican Lieutenant Governor of California, on three charges of perjury before the Senate committee.

=== Release of the transcripts ===
The Nixon administration struggled to decide what materials to release. All parties involved agreed that all pertinent information should be released. Whether to release unedited profanity and vulgarity divided his advisers. His legal team favored releasing the tapes unedited, while Press Secretary Ron Ziegler preferred using an edited version where &quot;expletive deleted&quot; would replace the raw material. After several weeks of debate, they decided to release an edited version. Nixon announced the release of the transcripts in a speech to the nation on April 29, 1974. Nixon noted that any audio pertinent to national security information could be redacted from the released tapes.

Initially, Nixon gained a positive reaction for his speech. As people read the transcripts over the next couple of weeks, however, former supporters among the public, media and political community called for Nixon&#x27;s resignation or impeachment. Vice President Gerald Ford said, &quot;While it may be easy to delete characterization from the printed page, we cannot delete characterization from people&#x27;s minds with a wave of the hand.&quot; The Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott said the transcripts revealed a &quot;deplorable, disgusting, shabby, and immoral&quot; performance on the part of the President and his former aides. The House Republican Leader John Jacob Rhodes agreed with Scott, and Rhodes recommended that if Nixon&#x27;s position continued to deteriorate, he &quot;ought to consider resigning as a possible option&quot;.

The editors of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;, a newspaper that had supported Nixon, wrote, &quot;He is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal.&quot; The &quot;Providence Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean.&quot; This newspaper continued that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the Western U.S. felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.

=== Supreme Court ===
The issue of access to the tapes went to the United States Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot;, the Court ruled unanimously (8–0) that claims of executive privilege over the tapes were void. (Then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist—who had recently been appointed to the Court by Nixon and most recently served in the Nixon Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel—recused himself from the case.) The Court ordered the President to release the tapes to the special prosecutor. On July 30, 1974, Nixon complied with the order and released the subpoenaed tapes to the public.

=== Release of the tapes ===
The tapes revealed several crucial conversations that took place between the president and his counsel, John Dean, on March 21, 1973. In this conversation, Dean summarized many aspects of the Watergate case, and focused on the subsequent cover-up, describing it as a &quot;cancer on the presidency&quot;. The burglary team was being paid hush money for their silence and Dean stated: &quot;That&#x27;s the most troublesome post-thing, because Bob [Haldeman] is involved in that; John [Ehrlichman] is involved in that; I am involved in that; Mitchell is involved in that. And that&#x27;s an obstruction of justice.&quot; Dean continued, saying that Howard Hunt was blackmailing the White House demanding money immediately. Nixon replied that the money should be paid: &quot;...  just looking at the immediate problem, don&#x27;t you have to have—handle Hunt&#x27;s financial situation damn soon? ... you&#x27;ve got to keep the cap on the bottle that much, in order to have any options&quot;.

At the time of the initial congressional proceedings, it was not known if Nixon had known and approved of the payments to the Watergate defendants earlier than this conversation. Nixon&#x27;s conversation with Haldeman on August 1, is one of several that establishes he did. Nixon said: &quot;Well ... they have to be paid. That&#x27;s all there is to that. They have to be paid.&quot; During the congressional debate on impeachment, some believed that impeachment required a criminally indictable offense. Nixon&#x27;s agreement to make the blackmail payments was regarded as an affirmative act to obstruct justice.

On December 7, investigators found that an 18½-minute portion of one recorded tape had been erased. Rose Mary Woods, Nixon&#x27;s longtime personal secretary, said she had accidentally erased the tape by pushing the wrong pedal on her tape player when answering the phone. The press ran photos of the set-up, showing that it was unlikely for Woods to answer the phone while keeping her foot on the pedal. Later forensic analysis in 2003 determined that the tape had been erased in several segments—at least five, and perhaps as many as nine.

== Final investigations and resignation ==

Nixon&#x27;s position was becoming increasingly precarious. On February 6, 1974, the House of Representatives approved giving the Judiciary Committee authority to investigate impeachment of the President. On July 27, 1974, the House Judiciary Committee voted 27-to-11 to recommend the first article of impeachment against the president: obstruction of justice. The Committee recommended the second article, abuse of power, on July 29, 1974. The next day, on July 30, 1974, the Committee recommended the third article: contempt of Congress. On August 20, 1974, the House authorized the printing of the Committee report H. Rep. 93–1305, which included the text of the resolution impeaching Nixon and set forth articles of impeachment against him.

=== &quot;Smoking Gun&quot; tape ===
On August 5, 1974, the White House released a previously unknown audio tape from June 23, 1972. Recorded only a few days after the break-in, it documented the initial stages of the cover-up: it revealed Nixon and Haldeman had a meeting in the Oval Office during which they discussed how to stop the FBI from continuing its investigation of the break-in, as they recognized that there was a high risk that their position in the scandal might be revealed.

Haldeman introduced the topic as follows:

...the Democratic break-in thing, we&#x27;re back to the—in the, the problem area because the FBI is not under control, because Gray doesn&#x27;t exactly know how to control them, and they have ... their investigation is now leading into some productive areas ... and it goes in some directions we don&#x27;t want it to go.

After explaining how the money from CRP was traced to the burglars, Haldeman explained to Nixon the cover-up plan: &quot;the way to handle this now is for us to have Walters [CIA] call Pat Gray [FBI] and just say, &#x27;Stay the hell out of this ... this is ah, business here we don&#x27;t want you to go any further on it.&#x27;&quot;

Nixon approved the plan, and after he was given more information about the involvement of his campaign in the break-in, he told Haldeman: &quot;All right, fine, I understand it all. We won&#x27;t second-guess Mitchell and the rest.&quot; Returning to the use of the CIA to obstruct the FBI, he instructed Haldeman: &quot;You call them in. Good. Good deal. Play it tough. That&#x27;s the way they play it and that&#x27;s the way we are going to play it.&quot;

Nixon denied that this constituted an obstruction of justice, as his instructions ultimately resulted in the CIA truthfully reporting to the FBI that there were no national security issues. Nixon urged the FBI to press forward with the investigation when they expressed concern about interference.

Before the release of this tape, Nixon had denied any involvement in the scandal. He claimed that there were no political motivations in his instructions to the CIA, and claimed he had no knowledge before March 21, 1973, of involvement by senior campaign officials such as John Mitchell. The contents of this tape persuaded Nixon&#x27;s own lawyers, Fred Buzhardt and James St. Clair, that &quot;the President had lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers—for more than two years&quot;. The tape, which Barber Conable referred to as a &quot;smoking gun&quot;, proved that Nixon had been involved in the cover-up from the beginning.

In the week before Nixon&#x27;s resignation, Ehrlichman and Haldeman tried unsuccessfully to get Nixon to grant them pardons—which he had promised them before their April 1973 resignations.

=== Resignation ===


The release of the smoking gun tape destroyed Nixon politically. The ten congressmen who had voted against all three articles of impeachment in the House Judiciary Committee announced they would support the impeachment article accusing Nixon of obstructing justice when the articles came up before the full House. Additionally, John Jacob Rhodes, the House leader of Nixon&#x27;s party, announced that he would vote to impeach, stating that &quot;coverup of criminal activity and misuse of federal agencies can neither be condoned nor tolerated&quot;.

On the night of August 7, 1974, Senators Barry Goldwater and Hugh Scott and Congressman Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office. Scott and Rhodes were the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, respectively; Goldwater was brought along as an elder statesman. The three lawmakers told Nixon that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain impeachment when the articles came up for vote in the full House. By one estimate, out of 435 representatives, no more than 75 were willing to vote against impeaching Nixon for obstructing justice. Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were enough votes in the Senate to convict him, and that no more than 15 Senators were willing to vote for acquittal—not even half of the 34 votes he needed to stay in office.

Faced with the inevitability of his impeachment and removal from office and with public opinion having turned decisively against him, Nixon decided to resign. In a from the Oval Office on the evening of August 8, 1974, the president said, in part:

The morning that his resignation took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said farewell to the White House staff in the East Room. A helicopter carried them from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Nixon later wrote that he thought, &quot;As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, I found myself thinking not of the past, but of the future. What could I do now?&quot; At Andrews, he and his family boarded an Air Force plane to El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in California, and then were transported to his home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente.

== President Ford&#x27;s pardon of Nixon ==


With Nixon&#x27;s resignation, Congress dropped its impeachment proceedings. Criminal prosecution was still a possibility at the federal level. Nixon was succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford as president, who on September 8, 1974, issued a full and unconditional pardon of Nixon, immunizing him from prosecution for any crimes he had &quot;committed or may have committed or taken part in&quot; as president. In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interest of the country. He said that the Nixon family&#x27;s situation &quot;is an American tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must.&quot;

Nixon continued to proclaim his innocence until his death in 1994. In his official response to the pardon, he said that he &quot;was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy&quot;.

Some commentators have argued that pardoning Nixon contributed to President Ford&#x27;s loss of the presidential election of 1976. Allegations of a secret deal made with Ford, promising a pardon in return for Nixon&#x27;s resignation, led Ford to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on October 17, 1974.

In his autobiography &quot;A Time to Heal&quot;, Ford wrote about a meeting he had with Nixon&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Alexander Haig. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon&#x27;s staff thought were Nixon&#x27;s only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process, to try to settle for a censure vote in Congress, or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon&#x27;s staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him.

== Aftermath ==

=== Final legal actions and effect on the law profession ===
Charles Colson pled guilty to charges concerning the Daniel Ellsberg case; in exchange, the indictment against him for covering up the activities of the Committee to Re-elect the President was dropped, as it was against Strachan. The remaining five members of the Watergate Seven indicted in March went on trial in October 1974. On January 1, 1975, all but Parkinson were found guilty. In 1976, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a new trial for Mardian; subsequently, all charges against him were dropped.

Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Mitchell exhausted their appeals in 1977. Ehrlichman entered prison in 1976, followed by the other two in 1977. Since Nixon and many senior officials involved in Watergate were lawyers, the scandal severely tarnished the public image of the legal profession.

The Watergate scandal resulted in 69 individuals being charged and 48 being found guilty, including:

# John N. Mitchell, Attorney General of the United States who resigned to become Director of Committee to Re-elect the President, convicted of perjury about his involvement in the Watergate break-in. Served 19 months of a one- to four-year sentence.
# Jeb Stuart Magruder, Deputy Director of Committee to Re-elect the President, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to the burglary, and was sentenced to 10 months to four years in prison, of which he served seven months before being paroled.
# Frederick C. LaRue, Advisor to John Mitchell, convicted of obstruction of justice. He served four and a half months.
# H. R. Haldeman, White House Chief of Staff, convicted of conspiracy to the burglary, obstruction of justice, and perjury. Served 18 months in prison.
# John Ehrlichman, White House Domestic Affairs Advisor, convicted of conspiracy to the burglary, obstruction of justice, and perjury. Served 18 months in prison.
# Egil Krogh, United States Under Secretary of Transportation, sentenced to six months for his part in the Daniel Ellsberg case.
# John W. Dean III, White House Counsel, convicted of obstruction of justice, later reduced to felony offenses and sentenced to time already served, which totaled four months.
# Dwight L. Chapin, Secretary to the President of the United States, convicted of perjury.
# Maurice Stans, United States Secretary of Commerce who resigned to become Finance Chairman of Committee to Re-elect the President, convicted of multiple counts of illegal campaigning, fined $5,000 (in 1975 – $ today).
# Herbert W. Kalmbach, personal attorney to Nixon, convicted of illegal campaigning. Served 191 days in prison and fined $10,000 (in 1974 – $ today).
# Charles W. Colson, Director of the Office of Public Liaison, convicted of obstruction of justice. Served seven months in Federal Maxwell Prison.
# Herbert L. Porter, aide to the Committee to Re-elect the President. Convicted of perjury.
# G. Gordon Liddy, Special Investigations Group, convicted of masterminding the burglary, original sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Served years in federal prison.
# E. Howard Hunt, security consultant, convicted of masterminding and overseeing the burglary, original sentence of up to 35 years in prison. Served 33 months in prison.
# James W. McCord Jr., convicted of six charges of burglary, conspiracy and wiretapping. Served two months in prison.
# Virgilio Gonzalez, convicted of burglary, original sentence of up to 40 years in prison. Served 13 months in prison.
# Bernard Barker, convicted of burglary, original sentence of up to 40 years in prison. Served 18 months in prison.
# Eugenio Martínez, convicted of burglary, original sentence of up to 40 years in prison. Served 15 months in prison.
# Frank Sturgis, convicted of burglary, original sentence of up to 40 years in prison. Served 10 months in prison.

To defuse public demand for direct federal regulation of lawyers (as opposed to leaving it in the hands of state bar associations or courts), the American Bar Association (ABA) launched two major reforms. First, the ABA decided that its existing Model Code of Professional Responsibility (promulgated 1969) was a failure. In 1983, the ABA replaced the Model Code with the Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The Model Rules have been adopted in part or in whole by all 50 states. The Model Rules&#x27;s preamble contains an emphatic reminder that the legal profession can remain self-governing only if lawyers behave properly. Second, the ABA promulgated a requirement that law students at ABA-approved law schools take a course in professional responsibility (which means they must study the Model Rules). The requirement remains in effect.

On June 24 and 25, 1975, Nixon gave secret testimony to a grand jury. According to news reports at the time, Nixon answered questions about the -minute tape gap, altering White House tape transcripts turned over to the House Judiciary Committee, using the Internal Revenue Service to harass political enemies, and a $100,000 contribution from billionaire Howard Hughes. Aided by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the historian Stanley Kutler, who has written several books about Nixon and Watergate and had successfully sued for the 1996 public release of the Nixon White House tapes, sued for the release of the transcripts of the Nixon grand jury testimony.

On July 29, 2011, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth granted Kutler&#x27;s request, saying historical interests trumped privacy, especially considering that Nixon and other key figures were deceased, and most of the surviving figures had testified under oath, have been written about, or were interviewed. The transcripts were not immediately released pending the government&#x27;s decision on whether to appeal. They were released in their entirety on November 10, 2011, although the names of people still alive were redacted.

Texas A&amp;M University–Central Texas professor Luke Nichter wrote to the chief judge of the federal court in Washington to release hundreds of pages of sealed records of the Watergate Seven. In June 2012 the U.S. Department of Justice wrote to the court that it would not object to their release with some exceptions. On November 2, 2012, Watergate trial records for G. Gordon Liddy and James McCord were ordered unsealed by Federal Judge Royce Lamberth.

=== Political and cultural reverberations ===
According to Thomas J. Johnson, a professor of journalism at University of Texas at Austin, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger predicted during Nixon&#x27;s final days that history would remember Nixon as a great president and that Watergate would be relegated to a &quot;minor footnote&quot;.

When Congress investigated the scope of the president&#x27;s legal powers, it belatedly found that consecutive presidential administrations had declared the United States to be in a continuous open-ended state of emergency since 1950. Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act in 1976 to regulate such declarations. The Watergate scandal left such an impression on the national and international consciousness that many scandals since then have been labeled with the &quot;-gate suffix&quot;.

Disgust with the revelations about Watergate, the Republican Party, and Nixon strongly affected results of the November 1974 Senate and House elections, which took place three months after Nixon&#x27;s resignation. The Democrats gained five seats in the Senate and forty-nine in the House (the newcomers were nicknamed &quot;Watergate Babies&quot;). Congress passed legislation that changed campaign financing, to amend the Freedom of Information Act, as well as to require financial disclosures by key government officials (via the Ethics in Government Act). Other types of disclosures, such as releasing recent income tax forms, became expected, though not legally required. Presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt had recorded many of their conversations but the practice purportedly ended after Watergate.

Ford&#x27;s pardon of Nixon played a major role in his defeat in the 1976 presidential election against Jimmy Carter.

In 1977, Nixon arranged an interview with British journalist David Frost in the hope of improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968, he believed that Frost would be an easy interviewer and was taken aback by Frost&#x27;s incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished. The 2008 movie &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; is a media depiction of this.

In the aftermath of Watergate, &quot;follow the money&quot; became part of the American lexicon and is widely believed to have been uttered by Mark Felt to Woodward and Bernstein. The phrase was never used in the 1974 book &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; and did not become associated with it until the movie of the same name was released in 1976. The 2017 movie &quot;Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House&quot; is about Felt&#x27;s role in the Watergate scandal and his identity as Deep Throat.

The parking garage where Woodward and Felt met in Rosslyn still stands. Its significance was noted by Arlington County with a historical marker in 2011. In 2017 it was announced that the garage would be demolished as part of construction of an apartment building on the site; the developers announced that the site&#x27;s significance would be memorialized within the new complex.

== Purpose of the break-in ==
Despite the enormous impact of the Watergate scandal, the purpose of the break-in of the DNC offices has never been conclusively established. Records from the &quot;United States v. Liddy&quot; trial, made public in 2013, showed that four of the five burglars testified that they were told the campaign operation hoped to find evidence that linked Cuban funding to Democratic campaigns. The longtime hypothesis suggests that the target of the break-in was the offices of Larry O&#x27;Brien, the DNC chairman. However, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s name was not on Alfred C. Baldwin III&#x27;s list of targets that was released in 2013. Among those listed were senior DNC official R. Spencer Oliver, Oliver&#x27;s secretary Ida &quot;Maxine&quot; Wells, co-worker Robert Allen and secretary Barbara Kennedy.

Based on these revelations, Texas A&amp;M history professor Luke Nichter, who had successfully petitioned for the release of the information, argued that Woodward and Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord&#x27;s word, that the purpose of the break-in was to bug O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s phone to gather political and financial intelligence on the Democrats. Instead, Nichter sided with late journalist J. Anthony Lukas of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who had concluded that the committee was seeking to find evidence linking the Democrats to prostitution, as it was alleged that Oliver&#x27;s office had been used to arrange such meetings. However, Nichter acknowledged that Woodward and Bernstein&#x27;s theory of O&#x27;Brien as the target could not be debunked unless the information was released about what Baldwin heard in his bugging of conversations.

In 1968, O&#x27;Brien was appointed by Vice President Hubert Humphrey to serve as the national director of Humphrey&#x27;s presidential campaign and, separately, by Howard Hughes to serve as Hughes&#x27; public-policy lobbyist in Washington. O&#x27;Brien was elected national chairman of the DNC in 1968 and 1970. In late 1971, the president&#x27;s brother, Donald Nixon, was collecting intelligence for his brother at the time and asked John H. Meier, an adviser to Howard Hughes, about O&#x27;Brien. In 1956, Donald Nixon had borrowed $205,000 from Howard Hughes and had never repaid the loan. The loan&#x27;s existence surfaced during the 1960 presidential election campaign, embarrassing Richard Nixon and becoming a political liability. According to author Donald M. Bartlett, Richard Nixon would do whatever was necessary to prevent another family embarrassment. From 1968 to 1970, Hughes withdrew nearly half a million dollars from the Texas National Bank of Commerce for contributions to both Democrats and Republicans, including presidential candidates Humphrey and Nixon. Hughes wanted Donald Nixon and Meier involved but Nixon opposed this.

Meier told Donald Nixon that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon&#x27;s illicit dealings with Hughes that had never been released, and that it resided with Larry O&#x27;Brien. According to Fred Emery, O&#x27;Brien had been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress, and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes&#x27; illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign was too much of a danger for Nixon to ignore.

James F. Neal, who prosecuted the Watergate 7, did not believe Nixon had ordered the break-in because of Nixon&#x27;s surprised reaction when he was told about it.

== Reactions ==

=== Australia ===
Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam referred to the American presidency&#x27;s &quot;parlous position&quot; without the direct wording of the Watergate scandal during Question Time in May 1973. The following day responding to a question upon &quot;the vital importance of future United States–Australia relations&quot;, Whitlam parried that the usage of the word &#x27;Watergate&#x27; was not his. United States–Australia relations have been considered to have figured as influential when, in November 1975, Australia experienced its own constitutional crisis which led to the dismissal of the Whitlam Government by Sir John Kerr, the Australian Governor-General. Max Suich has suggested that the US was involved in ending the Whitlam government.

=== China ===
Chinese then-Premier Zhou Enlai said in October 1973 that the scandal did not affect the relations between China and the United States. According to the then–Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj of Thailand in July 1975, Chairman Mao Zedong called the Watergate scandal &quot;the result of &#x27;too much freedom of political expression in the U.S. Mao called it &quot;an indication of American isolationism, which he saw as &#x27;disastrous&#x27; for Europe&quot;. He further said, &quot;Do Americans really want to go isolationist? ... In the two world wars, the Americans came [in] very late, but all the same, they did come in. They haven&#x27;t been isolationist in practice.&quot;

=== Japan ===
In August 1973, then–Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka said that the scandal had &quot;no cancelling influence on U.S. leadership in the world&quot;. Tanaka further said, &quot;The pivotal role of the United States has not changed, so this internal affair will not be permitted to have an effect.&quot; In March 1975, Tanaka&#x27;s successor, Takeo Miki, said at a convention of the Liberal Democratic Party, &quot;At the time of the Watergate issue in America, I was deeply moved by the scene in the House Judiciary Committee, where each member of the committee expressed his own or her own heart based upon the spirit of the American Constitution. It was this attitude, I think, that rescued American democracy.&quot;

=== Singapore ===
Then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said in August 1973 that the scandal may have led the United States to lessen its interests and commitments in world affairs, to weaken its ability to enforce the Paris Peace Accords on Vietnam, and to not react to violations of the Accords. Lee said further that the United States &quot;makes the future of this peace in Indonesia an extremely bleak one with grave consequence for the contiguous states.&quot; Lee then blamed the scandal for economic inflation in Singapore because the Singapore dollar was pegged to the United States dollar at the time because Singapore had &quot;unwisely&quot; believed that the U.S. dollar was stronger than the British pound sterling.

=== Soviet Union ===
In June 1973, when chairman Leonid Brezhnev arrived in the United States to have a one-week meeting with Nixon, Brezhnev told the press, &quot;I do not intend to refer to that matter—[the Watergate]. It would be completely indecent for me to refer to it ... My attitude toward Mr. Nixon is of very great respect.&quot; When one reporter suggested that Nixon and his position with Brezhnev were &quot;weakened&quot; by the scandal, Brezhnev replied, &quot;It does not enter my mind to think whether Mr. Nixon has lost or gained any influence because of the affair.&quot; Then he said further that he had respected Nixon because of Nixon&#x27;s &quot;realistic and constructive approach to Soviet Union–United States relations ... passing from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations between nations&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===
Talks between Nixon and Prime Minister Edward Heath may have been bugged. Heath did not publicly display his anger, with aides saying that he was unconcerned about having been bugged at the White House. According to officials, Heath commonly had notes taken of his public discussions with Nixon so a recording would not have bothered him. However, officials said that if Heath&#x27;s private talks with Nixon were bugged, then he would have been outraged.

=== Iran ===
Iranian then-Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi told the press in 1973, &quot;I want to say quite emphatically ... that everything that would weaken or jeopardize the President&#x27;s power to make decisions in split seconds would represent grave danger for the whole world.&quot;

=== Kenya ===
An unnamed Kenyan senior official of Foreign Affairs Ministry accused Nixon of lacking interest in Africa and its politics and then said, &quot;American President is so enmeshed in domestic problems created by Watergate that foreign policy seems suddenly to have taken a .&quot;

=== Cuba ===
Cuban then-leader Fidel Castro said in his December 1974 interview that, of the crimes committed by Cuban exiles, like killings, attacks on Cuban ports, and spying, the Watergate burglaries and wiretappings were &quot;probably the least of [them]&quot;.

=== United States ===
After the fall of Saigon ended the Vietnam War, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in May 1975 that, if the scandal had not caused Nixon to resign, and Congress had not overridden Nixon&#x27;s veto of the War Powers Resolution, North Vietnam would not have captured South Vietnam. Kissinger told the National Press Club in January 1977 that Nixon&#x27;s presidential powers weakened during his tenure, thus (as rephrased by the media) &quot;prevent[ing] the United States from exploiting the [scandal]&quot;.

The publisher of &quot;The Sacramento Union&quot;, John P. McGoff, said in January 1975 that the media overemphasized the scandal, though he called it &quot;an important issue&quot;, overshadowing more serious topics, like a declining economy and an energy crisis.

<text>In axiomatic set theory and the branches of logic, mathematics, and computer science that use it, the axiom of pairing is one of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. It was introduced by as a special case of his axiom of elementary sets.

== Formal statement ==
In the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads:
:formula_1

In words:
:Given any object &quot;A&quot; and any object &quot;B&quot;, there is a set &quot;C&quot; such that, given any object &quot;D&quot;, &quot;D&quot; is a member of &quot;C&quot; if and only if &quot;D&quot; is equal to &quot;A&quot; or &quot;D&quot; is equal to &quot;B&quot;.

== Consequences ==
As noted, what the axiom is saying is that, given two objects &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, we can find a set &quot;C&quot; whose members are exactly &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.

We can use the axiom of extensionality to show that this set &quot;C&quot; is unique. We call the set &quot;C&quot; the &quot;pair&quot; of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, and denote it {&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;}. Thus the essence of the axiom is:
:Any two objects have a pair.

The set {&quot;A&quot;,&quot;A&quot;} is abbreviated {&quot;A&quot;}, called the &quot;singleton&quot; containing &quot;A&quot;. Note that a singleton is a special case of a pair. Being able to construct a singleton is necessary, for example, to show the non-existence of the infinitely descending chains formula_2 from the Axiom of regularity.

The axiom of pairing also allows for the definition of ordered pairs. For any objects formula_3 and formula_4, the ordered pair is defined by the following:

:formula_5

Note that this definition satisfies the condition

:formula_6

Ordered &quot;n&quot;-tuples can be defined recursively as follows:

:formula_7

== Alternatives ==
=== Non-independence ===
The axiom of pairing is generally considered uncontroversial, and it or an equivalent appears in just about any axiomatization of set theory. Nevertheless, in the standard formulation of the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the axiom of pairing follows from the axiom schema of replacement applied to any given set with two or more elements, and thus it is sometimes omitted. The existence of such a set with two elements, such as { {}, { {} } }, can be deduced either from the axiom of empty set and the axiom of power set or from the axiom of infinity.

In the absence of some of the stronger ZFC axioms, the axiom of pairing can still, without loss, be introduced in weaker forms.

=== Weaker ===
In the presence of standard forms of the axiom schema of separation we can replace the axiom of pairing by its weaker version:
:formula_8.

This weak axiom of pairing implies that any given objects formula_9 and formula_10 are members of some set formula_11. Using the axiom schema of separation we can construct the set whose members are exactly formula_9 and formula_10.

Another axiom which implies the axiom of pairing in the presence of the axiom of empty set is the axiom of adjunction
:formula_14.
It differs from the standard one by use of formula_15 instead of formula_16. Using {} for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;x&quot; for B, we get {&quot;x&quot;} for C. Then use {&quot;x&quot;} for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;y&quot; for &quot;B&quot;, getting {&quot;x,y&quot;} for C. One may continue in this fashion to build up any finite set. And this could be used to generate all hereditarily finite sets without using the axiom of union.

=== Stronger ===
Together with the axiom of empty set and the axiom of union, the axiom of 
pairing can be generalised to the following schema:
:formula_17
that is:
:Given any finite number of objects &quot;A&quot;1 through &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;, there is a set &quot;C&quot; whose members are precisely &quot;A&quot;1 through &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
This set &quot;C&quot; is again unique by the axiom of extensionality, and is denoted {&quot;A&quot;1...,&quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;}.

Of course, we can&#x27;t refer to a &quot;finite&quot; number of objects rigorously without already having in our hands a (finite) set to which the objects in question belong. Thus, this is not a single statement but instead a schema, with a separate statement for each natural number &quot;n&quot;.
*The case &quot;n&quot; = 1 is the axiom of pairing with &quot;A&quot; = &quot;A&quot;1 and &quot;B&quot; = &quot;A&quot;1.
*The case &quot;n&quot; = 2 is the axiom of pairing with &quot;A&quot; = &quot;A&quot;1 and &quot;B&quot; = &quot;A&quot;2.
*The cases &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2 can be proved using the axiom of pairing and the axiom of union multiple times.
For example, to prove the case &quot;n&quot; = 3, use the axiom of pairing three times, to produce the pair {&quot;A&quot;1,&quot;A&quot;2}, the singleton {&quot;A&quot;3}, and then the pair .
The axiom of union then produces the desired result, {&quot;A&quot;1,&quot;A&quot;2,&quot;A&quot;3}. We can extend this schema to include &quot;n&quot;=0 if we interpret that case as the axiom of empty set.

Thus, one may use this as an axiom schema in the place of the axioms of empty set and pairing. Normally, however, one uses the axioms of empty set and pairing separately, and then proves this as a theorem schema. Note that adopting this as an axiom schema will not replace the axiom of union, which is still needed for other situations.

<text>In many popular versions of axiomatic set theory, the axiom schema of specification, also known as the axiom schema of separation (&quot;Aussonderungsaxiom&quot;), subset axiom, axiom of class construction, or axiom schema of restricted comprehension is an axiom schema. Essentially, it says that any definable subclass of a set is a set.

Some mathematicians call it the axiom schema of comprehension, although others use that term for &quot;unrestricted&quot; comprehension, discussed below.

Because restricting comprehension avoided Russell&#x27;s paradox, several mathematicians including Zermelo, Fraenkel, and Gödel considered it the most important axiom of set theory.

== Statement ==
One instance of the schema is included for each formula φ in the language of set theory with free variables among &quot;x&quot;, &quot;w&quot;1, ..., &quot;w&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;A&quot;. So &quot;B&quot; does not occur free in φ. In the formal language of set theory, the axiom schema is:
:formula_1

or in words:
: Given any set &quot;A&quot;, there is a set &quot;B&quot; (a subset of &quot;A&quot;) such that, given any set &quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot; is a member of &quot;B&quot; if and only if &quot;x&quot; is a member of &quot;A&quot; and φ holds for &quot;x&quot;. 
Note that there is one axiom for every such predicate φ; thus, this is an axiom schema.

To understand this axiom schema, note that the set &quot;B&quot; must be a subset of &quot;A&quot;. Thus, what the axiom schema is really saying is that, given a set &quot;A&quot; and a predicate formula_2, we can find a subset &quot;B&quot; of &quot;A&quot; whose members are precisely the members of &quot;A&quot; that satisfy formula_2. By the axiom of extensionality this set is unique. We usually denote this set using set-builder notation as formula_4. Thus the essence of the axiom is:
: Every subclass of a set that is defined by a predicate is itself a set.

The preceding form of separation was introduced in 1930 by Thoralf Skolem as a refinement of a previous, non-first-order form by Zermelo. The axiom schema of specification is characteristic of systems of axiomatic set theory related to the usual set theory ZFC, but does not usually appear in radically different systems of alternative set theory. For example, New Foundations and positive set theory use different restrictions of the axiom of comprehension of naive set theory. The Alternative Set Theory of Vopenka makes a specific point of allowing proper subclasses of sets, called semisets. Even in systems related to ZFC, this scheme is sometimes restricted to formulas with bounded quantifiers, as in Kripke–Platek set theory with urelements.
== Relation to the axiom schema of replacement ==
The axiom schema of specification is implied by the axiom schema of replacement together with the axiom of empty set.

The &quot;axiom schema of replacement&quot; says that, if a function formula_5 is definable by a formula formula_6, then for any set formula_7, there exists a set formula_8:

:formula_9.

To derive the axiom schema of specification, let formula_10 be a formula and formula_11 a set, and define the function formula_5 such that formula_13 if formula_10 is true and formula_15 if formula_10 is false, where formula_17 such that formula_18 is true. Then the set formula_19 guaranteed by the axiom schema of replacement is precisely the set formula_19 required in the axiom schema of specification. If formula_21 does not exist, then formula_22 in the axiom schema of specification is the empty set, whose existence (i.e., the axiom of empty set) is then needed.

For this reason, the axiom schema of specification is left out of some axiomatizations of ZF (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory), although some authors, despite the redundancy, include both. Regardless, the axiom schema of specification is notable because it was in Zermelo&#x27;s original 1908 list of axioms, before Fraenkel invented the axiom of replacement in 1922. Additionally, if one takes ZFC set theory (i.e., ZF with the axiom of choice), removes the axiom of replacement and the axiom of collection, but keeps the axiom schema of specification, one gets the weaker system of axioms called ZC (i.e., Zermelo&#x27;s axioms, plus the axiom of choice).

== Unrestricted comprehension ==
The axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension reads:

formula_23

that is:
This set is again unique, and is usually denoted as {{math|{{{var|x}} : {{var|φ}}({{var|x}}, {{mvar|w}}{{sub|1}}, ..., {{var|w}}{{sub|{{mvar|b}}}})}.}}

In an unsorted material set theory, the axiom or rule of full or unrestricted comprehension says that for any property &quot;P&quot;, there exists a set {&quot;x&quot; | &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)} of all objects satisfying &quot;P.&quot;

This axiom schema was tacitly used in the early days of naive set theory, before a strict axiomatization was adopted. However, it was later discovered to lead directly to Russell&#x27;s paradox, by taking {{math|{{var|φ}}({{var|x}})}} to be {{math|¬({{var|x}} ∈ {{var|x}})}} (i.e., the property that set {{mvar|x}} is not a member of itself). Therefore, no useful axiomatization of set theory can use unrestricted comprehension. Passing from classical logic to intuitionistic logic does not help, as the proof of Russell&#x27;s paradox is intuitionistically valid.

Accepting only the axiom schema of specification was the beginning of axiomatic set theory. Most of the other Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms (but not the axiom of extensionality, the axiom of regularity, or the axiom of choice) then became necessary to make up for some of what was lost by changing the axiom schema of comprehension to the axiom schema of specification – each of these axioms states that a certain set exists, and defines that set by giving a predicate for its members to satisfy, i.e. it is a special case of the axiom schema of comprehension.

It is also possible to prevent the schema from being inconsistent by restricting which formulae it can be applied to, such as only stratified formulae in New Foundations (see below) or only positive formulae (formulae with only conjunction, disjunction, quantification and atomic formulae) in positive set theory. Positive formulae, however, typically are unable to express certain things that most theories can; for instance, there is no complement or relative complement in positive set theory.

== In NBG class theory ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2024}}
In von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, a distinction is made between sets and classes. A class {{mvar|C}} is a set if and only if it belongs to some class {{mvar|E}}. In this theory, there is a theorem schema that reads
formula_24

that is,
{{block indent|There is a class {{mvar|D}} such that any class {{mvar|C}} is a member of {{mvar|D}} if and only if {{mvar|C}} is a set that satisfies {{mvar|P}}.}}

provided that the quantifiers in the predicate {{mvar|P}} are restricted to sets.

This theorem schema is itself a restricted form of comprehension, which avoids Russell&#x27;s paradox because of the requirement that {{mvar|C}} be a set. Then specification for sets themselves can be written as a single axiom
formula_25

that is,
{{block indent|Given any class {{mvar|D}} and any set {{mvar|A}}, there is a set {{mvar|B}} whose members are precisely those classes that are members of both {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|D}}.}}

or even more simply
{{block indent|The intersection of a class {{mvar|D}} and a set {{mvar|A}} is itself a set {{mvar|B}}.}}

In this axiom, the predicate {{mvar|P}} is replaced by the class {{mvar|D}}, which can be quantified over. Another simpler axiom which achieves the same effect is
formula_26

that is,
{{block indent|A subclass of a set is a set.}}

== In higher-order settings ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2024}}
In a typed language where we can quantify over predicates, the axiom schema of specification becomes a simple axiom. This is much the same trick as was used in the NBG axioms of the previous section, where the predicate was replaced by a class that was then quantified over.

In second-order logic and higher-order logic with higher-order semantics, the axiom of specification is a logical validity and does not need to be explicitly included in a theory.

== In Quine&#x27;s New Foundations ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2024}}
In the New Foundations approach to set theory pioneered by W. V. O. Quine, the axiom of comprehension for a given predicate takes the unrestricted form, but the predicates that may be used in the schema are themselves restricted. The predicate ({{mvar|C}} is not in {{mvar|C}}) is forbidden, because the same symbol {{mvar|C}} appears on both sides of the membership symbol (and so at different &quot;relative types&quot;); thus, Russell&#x27;s paradox is avoided. However, by taking {{math|{{var|P}}({{var|C}})}} to be {{math|1=({{var|C}} = {{var|C}})}}, which is allowed, we can form a set of all sets. For details, see stratification.

<text>In set theory, the axiom schema of replacement is a schema of axioms in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) that asserts that the image of any set under any definable mapping is also a set. It is necessary for the construction of certain infinite sets in ZF.

The axiom schema is motivated by the idea that whether a class is a set depends only on the cardinality of the class, not on the rank of its elements. Thus, if one class is &quot;small enough&quot; to be a set, and there is a surjection from that class to a second class, the axiom states that the second class is also a set. However, because ZFC only speaks of sets, not proper classes, the schema is stated only for definable surjections, which are identified with their defining formulas.

== Statement ==

Suppose formula_1 is a definable binary relation (which may be a proper class) such that for every set formula_2 there is a unique set formula_3 such that formula_4 holds. There is a corresponding definable function formula_5, where formula_6 if and only if formula_4. Consider the (possibly proper) class formula_8 defined such that for every set formula_3, formula_10 if and only if there is an formula_11 with formula_6. formula_8 is called the image of formula_14 under formula_5, and denoted formula_16 or (using set-builder notation) formula_17.

The axiom schema of replacement states that if formula_18 is a definable class function, as above, and formula_14 is any set, then the image formula_20 is also a set. This can be seen as a principle of smallness: the axiom states that if formula_14 is small enough to be a set, then formula_20 is also small enough to be a set. It is implied by the stronger axiom of limitation of size.

Because it is impossible to quantify over definable functions in first-order logic, one instance of the schema is included for each formula formula_23 in the language of set theory with free variables among formula_24; but formula_8 is not free in formula_23. In the formal language of set theory, the axiom schema is:
:formula_27

For the meaning of formula_28, see uniqueness quantification.

For clarity, in the case of no variables formula_29, this simplifies to:
:formula_30

So whenever formula_23 specifies a unique formula_2-to-formula_3 correspondence, akin to a function formula_18 on formula_14, then all formula_3 reached this way can be collected into a set formula_8, akin to formula_20.

== Applications ==
The axiom schema of replacement is not necessary for the proofs of most theorems of ordinary mathematics. Indeed, Zermelo set theory (Z) already can interpret second-order arithmetic and much of type theory in finite types, which in turn are sufficient to formalize the bulk of mathematics. Although the axiom schema of replacement is a standard axiom in set theory today, it is often omitted from systems of type theory and foundation systems in topos theory.

At any rate, the axiom schema drastically increases the strength of ZF, both in terms of the theorems it can prove - for example the sets shown to exist - and also in terms of its proof-theoretic consistency strength, compared to Z. Some important examples follow:

* Using the modern definition due to von Neumann, proving the existence of any limit ordinal greater than ω requires the replacement axiom. The ordinal number ω·2 = ω + ω is the first such ordinal. The axiom of infinity asserts the existence of an infinite set ω = {0, 1, 2, ...}. One may hope to define ω·2 as the union of the sequence {ω, ω + 1, ω + 2...}. However, arbitrary such classes of ordinals need not be sets - for example, the class of all ordinals is not a set. Replacement now allows one to replace each finite number &quot;n&quot; in ω with the corresponding ω + &quot;n&quot;, and thus guarantees that this class is a set. As a clarification, note that one can easily construct a well-ordered set that is isomorphic to ω·2 without resorting to replacement – simply take the disjoint union of two copies of ω, with the second copy greater than the first – but that this is not an ordinal since it is not totally ordered by inclusion.
* Larger ordinals rely on replacement less directly. For example, ω1, the first uncountable ordinal, can be constructed as follows – the set of countable well orders exists as a subset of formula_39 by separation and powerset (a relation on &quot;A&quot; is a subset of formula_40, and so an element of the power set formula_41. A set of relations is thus a subset of formula_41). Replace each well-ordered set with its ordinal. This is the set of countable ordinals ω1, which can itself be shown to be uncountable. The construction uses replacement twice; once to ensure an ordinal assignment for each well ordered set and again to replace well ordered sets by their ordinals. This is a special case of the result of Hartogs number, and the general case can be proved similarly.
* In light of the above, the existence of an assignment of an ordinal to every well-ordered set requires replacement as well. Similarly the von Neumann cardinal assignment which assigns a cardinal number to each set requires replacement, as well as axiom of choice.
* For sets of tuples recursively defined as formula_43 and for large formula_14, the set formula_45 has too high of a rank for its existence to be provable from set theory with just the axiom of power set, choice and without replacement.
* Similarly, Harvey Friedman showed that at least some instances of replacement are required to show that Borel games are determined. The proven result is Donald A. Martin&#x27;s Borel determinacy theorem. A later, more careful analysis by Martin of the result showed that it only requires replacement for functions with domain an arbitrary countable ordinal.
* ZF with replacement proves the consistency of Z, as the set Vω·2 is a model of Z whose existence can be proved in ZF. The cardinal number formula_46 is the first one which can be shown to exist in ZF but not in Z. For clarification, note that Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem shows that each of these theories contains a sentence, &quot;expressing&quot; the theory&#x27;s own consistency, that is unprovable in that theory, if that theory is consistent - this result is often loosely expressed as the claim that neither of these theories can prove its own consistency, if it is consistent.

== Relation to other axiom schemas ==
=== Simplifications ===
Some simplifications may be made to the axiom schema of replacement to obtain different equivalent versions. Azriel Lévy showed that a version of replacement with parameters removed, i.e. the following schema, is equivalent to the original form. In particular the equivalence holds in the presence of the axioms of extensionality, pairing, union and powerset.

: formula_47

=== Collection ===

The axiom schema of collection is closely related to and frequently confused with the axiom schema of replacement. 
Over the remainder of the ZF axioms, it is equivalent to the axiom schema of replacement. The axiom of collection is stronger than replacement in the absence of the power set axiom or its constructive counterpart of ZF and is used in the framework of IZF, which lacks the law of excluded middle, instead of Replacement which is weaker.

While replacement can be read to say that the image of a function is a set, collection speaks about images of relations and then merely says that some superclass of the relation&#x27;s image is a set. 
In other words, the resulting set formula_8 has no minimality requirement, i.e. this variant also lacks the uniqueness requirement on formula_23. 
That is, the relation defined by formula_23 is not required to be a function—some formula_11 may correspond to many formula_3&#x27;s in formula_8. In this case, the image set formula_8 whose existence is asserted must contain at least one such formula_3 for each formula_2 in the original set, with no guarantee that it will contain only one.

Suppose that the free variables of formula_23 are among formula_58; but neither formula_14 nor formula_8 is free in formula_23. Then the axiom schema is:
:formula_62

The axiom schema is sometimes stated without prior restrictions (apart from formula_8 not occurring free in formula_23) on the predicate, formula_23:
:formula_66

In this case, there may be elements formula_2 in formula_14 that are not associated to any other sets by formula_23. However, the axiom schema as stated requires that, if an element formula_2 of formula_14 is associated with at least one set formula_3, then the image set formula_8 will contain at least one such formula_3. The resulting axiom schema is also called the axiom schema of boundedness.

=== Separation ===
The axiom schema of separation, the other axiom schema in ZFC, is implied by the axiom schema of replacement and the axiom of empty set. Recall that the axiom schema of separation includes
:formula_75
for each formula formula_76 in the language of set theory in which formula_8 is not free, i.e. formula_76 that does not mention formula_8. 

The proof is as follows: Either formula_14 contains some element formula_81 validating formula_82, or it does not. In the latter case, taking the empty set for formula_8 fulfills the relevant instance of the axiom schema of separation and one is done. Otherwise, choose such a fixed formula_81 in formula_14 that validates formula_82. Now define formula_87 for use with replacement. Using function notation for this predicate formula_23, it acts as the identity formula_89 wherever formula_90 is true and as the constant function formula_91 wherever formula_90 is false. By case analysis, the possible values formula_3 are unique for any formula_2, meaning formula_95 indeed constitutes a class function. In turn, the image formula_96 of formula_14 under formula_95, i.e. the class formula_99, is granted to be a set by the axiom of replacement. This formula_8 precisely validates the axiom of separation.

This result shows that it is possible to axiomatize ZFC with a single infinite axiom schema. Because at least one such infinite schema is required (ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable), this shows that the axiom schema of replacement can stand as the only infinite axiom schema in ZFC if desired. Because the axiom schema of separation is not independent, it is sometimes omitted from contemporary statements of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms.

Separation is still important, however, for use in fragments of ZFC, because of historical considerations, and for comparison with alternative axiomatizations of set theory. A formulation of set theory that does not include the axiom of replacement will likely include some form of the axiom of separation, to ensure that its models contain a sufficiently rich collection of sets. In the study of models of set theory, it is sometimes useful to consider models of ZFC without replacement, such as the models formula_101 in von Neumann&#x27;s hierarchy.

The proof given above assumes the law of excluded middle for the proposition that formula_14 is inhabited by a set validating formula_76, and for any formula_90 when stipulating that the relation formula_23 is functional. The axiom of separation is explicitly included in constructive set theory, or a bounded variant thereof.

===Reflection===
Lévy&#x27;s reflection principle for ZFC is equivalent to the axiom of replacement, assuming the axiom of infinity. Lévy&#x27;s principle is as follows:

: For any formula_106 and any first-order formula formula_107, there exists an formula_108 such that formula_109.

This is a schema that consists of countably many statements, one for each formula formula_23. Here, formula_111 means formula_23 with all quantifiers bounded to formula_113, i.e. formula_23 but with every instance of formula_115 and formula_116 replaced with formula_117 and formula_118 respectively.

== History ==
The axiom schema of replacement was not part of Ernst Zermelo&#x27;s 1908 axiomatisation of set theory (Z). Some informal approximation to it existed in Cantor&#x27;s unpublished works, and it appeared again informally in Mirimanoff (1917).
Its publication by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922 is what makes modern set theory Zermelo-&quot;Fraenkel&quot; set theory (ZFC). The axiom was independently discovered and announced by Thoralf Skolem later in the same year (and published in 1923). Zermelo himself incorporated Fraenkel&#x27;s axiom in his revised system he published in 1930, which also included as a new axiom von Neumann&#x27;s axiom of foundation. Although it is Skolem&#x27;s first order version of the axiom list that we use today, he usually gets no credit since each individual axiom was developed earlier by either Zermelo or Fraenkel. The phrase “Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory” was first used in print by von Neumann in 1928.

Zermelo and Fraenkel had corresponded heavily in 1921; the axiom of replacement was a major topic of this exchange. Fraenkel initiated correspondence with Zermelo sometime in March 1921. However, his letters before the one dated 6 May 1921 are lost. Zermelo first admitted to a gap in his system in a reply to Fraenkel dated 9 May 1921. On 10 July 1921, Fraenkel completed and submitted for publication a paper (published in 1922) that described his axiom as allowing arbitrary replacements: &quot;If &quot;M&quot; is a set and each element of &quot;M&quot; is replaced by [a set or an urelement] then &quot;M&quot; turns into a set again&quot; (parenthetical completion and translation by Ebbinghaus). Fraenkel&#x27;s 1922 publication thanked Zermelo for helpful arguments. Prior to this publication, Fraenkel publicly announced his new axiom at a meeting of the German Mathematical Society held in Jena on 22 September 1921. Zermelo was present at this meeting; in the discussion following Fraenkel&#x27;s talk he accepted the axiom of replacement in general terms, but expressed reservations regarding its extent.

Thoralf Skolem made public his discovery of the gap in Zermelo&#x27;s system (the same gap that Fraenkel had found) in a talk he gave on 6 July 1922 at the 5th Congress of Scandinavian Mathematicians, which was held in Helsinki; the proceedings of this congress were published in 1923. Skolem presented a resolution in terms of first-order definable replacements: &quot;Let &quot;U&quot; be a definite proposition that holds for certain pairs (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) in the domain &quot;B&quot;; assume further, that for every &quot;a&quot; there exists at most one &quot;b&quot; such that &quot;U&quot; is true. Then, as &quot;a&quot; ranges over the elements of a set &quot;Ma&quot;, &quot;b&quot; ranges over all elements of a set &quot;Mb&quot;.&quot; In the same year, Fraenkel wrote a review of Skolem&#x27;s paper, in which Fraenkel simply stated that Skolem&#x27;s considerations correspond to his own.

Zermelo himself never accepted Skolem&#x27;s formulation of the axiom schema of replacement. At one point he called Skolem&#x27;s approach “set theory of the impoverished”. Zermelo envisaged a system that would allow for large cardinals. He also objected strongly to the philosophical implications of countable models of set theory, which followed from Skolem&#x27;s first-order axiomatization. According to the biography of Zermelo by Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus, Zermelo&#x27;s disapproval of Skolem&#x27;s approach marked the end of Zermelo&#x27;s influence on the developments of set theory and logic.
