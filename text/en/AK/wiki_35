<text>San Jose, ( ; ) is the largest city in Northern California by both population and area. With a 2022 population of 971,233, it is the most populous city in both the Bay Area and the San Jose–San Francisco–Oakland Combined Statistical Area—which in 2022 had a population of 7.5 million and 9.0 million respectively—the third-most populous city in California after Los Angeles and San Diego, and the 13th-most populous in the United States. Located in the center of the Santa Clara Valley on the southern shore of San Francisco Bay, San Jose covers an area of . San Jose is the county seat of Santa Clara County and the main component of the San Jose–Sunnyvale–Santa Clara Metropolitan Statistical Area, with an estimated population of around 1.95 million residents in 2023.

San Jose is notable for its innovation, cultural diversity, affluence, and sunny and mild Mediterranean climate. Its connection to the booming high tech industry phenomenon known as Silicon Valley prompted Mayor Tom McEnery to adopt the city motto of &quot;Capital of Silicon Valley&quot; in 1988 to promote the city. Major global tech companies including Cisco Systems, eBay, Adobe Inc., PayPal, Broadcom, and Zoom maintain their headquarters in San Jose. One of the wealthiest major cities in the world, San Jose has the third-highest GDP per capita (after Zurich and Oslo) and the fifth-most expensive housing market. It is home to one of the world&#x27;s largest overseas Vietnamese populations, a Hispanic community that makes up over 40% of the city&#x27;s residents, and historic ethnic enclaves such as Japantown and Little Portugal.

Before the arrival of the Spanish, the area around San Jose was long inhabited by the Tamien nation of the Ohlone peoples of California. San Jose was founded on November 29, 1777, as the &quot;Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe&quot;, the first city founded in the Californias. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 after the Mexican War of Independence.

Following the American Conquest of California during the Mexican–American War, the territory was ceded to the United States in 1848. After California achieved statehood two years later, San Jose was designated as the state&#x27;s first capital. Following World War II, San Jose experienced an economic boom, with a rapid population growth and aggressive annexation of nearby cities and communities carried out in the 1950s and 1960s. The rapid growth of the high-technology and electronics
industries further accelerated the transition from an agricultural center to an urbanized metropolitan area. Results of the 1990 U.S. census indicated that San Jose had officially surpassed San Francisco as the most populous city in Northern California. By the 1990s, San Jose had become the global center for the high tech and internet industries and was California&#x27;s fastest-growing economy for 2015–2016. Between April 2020 and July 2022, San Jose lost 42,000 people, 4.1% of its population, dropping to 12th, and then 13th largest city position in largest city ranking.

== Name ==
San Jose is named after , the city&#x27;s predecessor, which was eventually located in the area of what is now the Plaza de César Chávez. In the 19th century, print publications used the spelling &quot;San José&quot; for both the city and its eponymous township. On December 11, 1943, the United States Board on Geographic Names ruled that the city&#x27;s name should be spelled &quot;San Jose&quot; based on local usage and the formal incorporated name.

In the 1960s and 1970s, some residents and officials advocated for returning to the original spelling of &quot;San José&quot;, with the acute accent on the &quot;e&quot;, to acknowledge the city&#x27;s Mexican origin and Mexican-American population. On June 2, 1969, the city adopted a flag designed by historian Clyde Arbuckle that prominently featured the inscription &quot;SAN JOSÉ, CALIFORNIA&quot;. On June 16, 1970, San Jose State College officially adopted &quot;San José&quot; as the city&#x27;s name, including in the college&#x27;s own name. On August 20, 1974, the San Jose City Council approved a proposal by Catherine Linquist to rename the city &quot;San José&quot; but reversed itself a week later under pressure from residents concerned with the cost of changing typewriters, documents, and signs. On April 3, 1979, the city council once again adopted &quot;San José&quot; as the spelling of the city name on the city seal, official stationery, office titles and department names. As late as 2010, the 1965 city charter stated the name of the municipal corporation as &quot;City of San Jose&quot;, without the accent mark, but later editions have added the accent mark.

By convention, the spelling &quot;San José&quot; is only used when the name is spelled in mixed upper- and lowercase letters, but not when the name is spelled only in uppercase letters, as on the city logo. The accent reflects the Spanish version of the name, and the dropping of accents in all-capital writing was once typical in Spanish. While San José is commonly spelled both with and without the acute accent over the &quot;e&quot;, the city&#x27;s official guidelines indicate that it should be spelled with the accent most of the time and sets forth narrow exceptions, such as when the spelling is in URLs, when the name appears in all-capital letters, when the name is used on social media sites where the diacritical mark does not render properly, and where San Jose is part of the proper name of another organization or business, such as San Jose Chamber of Commerce, that has chosen not to use the accent-marked name.

== History ==
=== Precolonial period ===
San Jose, along with most of the Santa Clara Valley, has been home to the Tamien group (also spelled as Tamyen, Thamien) of the Ohlone people since around 4,000 BC. The Tamien spoke Tamyen language of the Ohlone language family.

During the era of Spanish colonization and the subsequent building of Spanish missions in California, the Tamien people&#x27;s lives changed dramatically. From 1777 onward, most of the Tamien people were forcibly enslaved at Mission Santa Clara de Asís or Mission San José where they were baptized and educated to be Catholic &quot;neophytes&quot;, also known as Mission Indians. This continued until the mission was secularized by the Mexican Government in 1833. A large majority of the Tamien died either from disease in the missions, or as a result of the state sponsored genocide. Some surviving families remained intact, migrating to Santa Cruz after their ancestral lands were granted to Spanish and Mexican Immigrants.

=== Spanish period ===

California was claimed as part of the Spanish Empire in 1542, when explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo charted the Californian coast. During this time Alta California and the Baja California peninsula were administered together as Province of the Californias (). For nearly 200 years, the Californias remained a distant frontier region largely controlled by the numerous Native Nations and largely ignored by the government of the Viceroyalty of New Spain in Mexico City. Shifting power dynamics in North America—including the British/American victory and acquisition of North America, east of the Mississippi following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, as well as the start of Russian colonization of northwestern North America— prompted Spanish/Mexican authorities to sponsor the Portolá Expedition to survey Northern California in 1769.

In 1776, the Californias were included as part of the Captaincy General of the &quot;Provincias Internas&quot;, a large administrative division created by José de Gálvez, Spanish Minister of the Indies, in order to provide greater autonomy for the Spanish Empire&#x27;s borderlands. That year, King Carlos III of Spain approved an expedition by Juan Bautista de Anza to survey the San Francisco Bay Area, in order to choose the sites for two future settlements and their accompanying mission. De Anza initially chose the site for a military settlement in San Francisco, for the Royal Presidio of San Francisco, and Mission San Francisco de Asís. On his way back to Mexico from San Francisco, de Anza chose the sites in Santa Clara Valley for a civilian settlement, San Jose, on the eastern bank of the Guadalupe River, and a mission on its western bank, Mission Santa Clara de Asís.

San Jose was officially founded as California&#x27;s first civilian settlement on November 29, 1777, as the &quot;Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe&quot; by José Joaquín Moraga, under orders of Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa, Viceroy of New Spain. San Jose served as a strategic settlement along El Camino Real, connecting the military fortifications at the Monterey Presidio and the San Francisco Presidio, as well as the California mission network. In 1791, due to the severe flooding which characterized the pueblo, San Jose&#x27;s settlement was moved approximately a mile south, centered on the Pueblo Plaza (modern-day Plaza de César Chávez).

In 1800, due to the growing population in the northern part of the Californias, Diego de Borica, Governor of the Californias, officially split the province into two parts: Alta California (&quot;Upper California&quot;), which eventually became several western U.S. states, and Baja California (&quot;Lower California&quot;), which eventually became two Mexican states.

=== Mexican period ===
San Jose became part of the First Mexican Empire in 1821, after Mexico&#x27;s War of Independence was won against the Spanish Crown, and in 1824, part of the First Mexican Republic. With its newfound independence, and the triumph of the republican movement, Mexico set out to diminish the Catholic Church&#x27;s power within Alta California by secularizing the California missions in 1833.

In 1824, in order to promote settlement and economic activity within sparsely populated California, the Mexican government began an initiative, for Mexican and foreign citizens alike, to settle unoccupied lands in California. Between 1833 and 1845, thirty-eight rancho land grants were issued in the Santa Clara Valley, 15 of which were located within modern-day San Jose&#x27;s borders. Numerous prominent historical figures were among those granted rancho lands in the Santa Valley, including James A. Forbes, founder of Los Gatos, California (granted Rancho Potrero de Santa Clara), Antonio Suñol, Alcalde of San Jose (granted Rancho Los Coches), and José María Alviso, Alcalde of San Jose (granted Rancho Milpitas).

In 1835, San Jose&#x27;s population of approximately 700 people included 40 foreigners, primarily Americans and Englishmen. By 1845, the population of the pueblo had increased to 900, primarily due to American immigration. Foreign settlement in San Jose and California was rapidly changing Californian society, bringing expanding economic opportunities and foreign culture.

By 1846, native Californios had long expressed their concern for the overrunning of California society by its growing and wealthy Anglo-American community. During the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt, Captain Thomas Fallon led nineteen volunteers from Santa Cruz to the pueblo of San Jose, which his forces easily captured. The raising of the flag of the California Republic ended Mexican rule in Alta California on July 14, 1846.

=== American period ===

By the end of 1847, the Conquest of California by the United States was complete, as the Mexican–American War came to an end. In 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo formally ceded California to the United States, as part of the Mexican Cession. On December 15, 1849, San Jose became the capital of the unorganized territory of California. With California&#x27;s Admission to the Union on September 9, 1850, San Jose became the state&#x27;s first capital.

On March 27, 1850, San Jose was incorporated. It was incorporated on the same day as San Diego and Benicia; together, these three cities followed Sacramento as California&#x27;s earliest incorporated cities. Josiah Belden, who had settled in California in 1842 after traversing the California Trail as part of the Bartleson Party and later acquired a fortune, was the city&#x27;s first mayor. San Jose was briefly California&#x27;s first state capital, and legislators met in the city from 1849 to 1851. (Monterey was the capital during the period of Spanish California and Mexican California). The first capitol no longer exists; the Plaza de César Chávez now lies on the site, which has two historical markers indicating where California&#x27;s state legislature first met.

In the period 1900 through 1910, San Jose served as a center for pioneering invention, innovation, and impact in both lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air flight. These activities were led principally by John Montgomery and his peers. The City of San Jose has established Montgomery Park, a Monument at San Felipe and Yerba Buena Roads, and John J. Montgomery Elementary School in his honor. During this period, San Jose also became a center of innovation for the mechanization and industrialization of agricultural and food processing equipment.

Though not affected as severely as San Francisco, San Jose also suffered significant damage from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Over 100 people died at the Agnews Asylum (later Agnews State Hospital) after its walls and roof collapsed, and San Jose High School&#x27;s three-story stone-and-brick building was also destroyed. The period during World War II was tumultuous; Japanese Americans primarily from Japantown were sent to internment camps, including the future mayor Norman Mineta. Following the Los Angeles zoot suit riots, anti-Mexican violence took place during the summer of 1943. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported San Jose&#x27;s population as 98% white.

As World War II started, the city&#x27;s economy shifted from agriculture (the Del Monte cannery was the largest employer and closed in 1999) to industrial manufacturing with the contracting of the Food Machinery Corporation (later known as FMC Corporation) by the United States War Department to build 1,000 Landing Vehicle Tracked. After World War II, FMC (later United Defense, and currently BAE Systems) continued as a defense contractor, with the San Jose facilities designing and manufacturing military platforms such as the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and various subsystems of the M1 Abrams battle tank.

IBM established its first West Coast operations in San Jose in 1943 with a downtown punch card plant, and opened an IBM Research lab in 1952. Reynold B. Johnson and his team developed direct access storage for computers, inventing the RAMAC 305 and the hard disk drive; the technological side of San Jose&#x27;s economy grew.

During the 1950s and 1960s, City Manager A. P. &quot;Dutch&quot; Hamann led the city in a major growth campaign. The city annexed adjacent areas, such as Alviso and Cambrian Park, providing large areas for suburbs. An anti-growth reaction to the effects of rapid development emerged in the 1970s, championed by mayors Norman Mineta and Janet Gray Hayes. Despite establishing an urban growth boundary, development fees, and the incorporations of Campbell and Cupertino, development was not slowed, but rather directed into already-incorporated areas.

San Jose&#x27;s position in Silicon Valley triggered further economic and population growth. Results from the 1990 U.S. Census indicated that San Jose surpassed San Francisco as the most populous city in the Bay Area for the first time. This growth led to the highest housing-cost increase in the nation, 936% between 1976 and 2001. Efforts to increase density continued into the 1990s when an update of the 1974 urban plan kept the urban growth boundaries intact and voters rejected a ballot measure to ease development restrictions in the foothills. As of 2006, sixty percent of the housing built in San Jose since 1980 and over three-quarters of the housing built since 2000 have been multifamily structures, reflecting a political propensity toward Smart Growth planning principles.

== Geography ==

San Jose is located within the Santa Clara Valley, in the southern part of the Bay Area in Northern California. The northernmost portion of San Jose touches San Francisco Bay at Alviso, though most of the city lies away from the bayshore. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , making the fourth-largest city in California by land area (after Los Angeles, San Diego, California City, and Erie).

San Jose lies between the San Andreas Fault, the source of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and the Calaveras Fault. San Jose is shaken by moderate earthquakes on average one or two times a year. These quakes originate just east of the city on the creeping section of the Calaveras Fault, which is a major source of earthquake activity in Northern California. On April 14, 1984, at 1:15 pm local time, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck the Calaveras Fault near San Jose&#x27;s Mount Hamilton. The most serious earthquake, in 1906, damaged many buildings in San Jose as described earlier. Earlier significant quakes rocked the city in 1839, 1851, 1858, 1864, 1865, 1868, and 1891. The Daly City Earthquake of 1957 caused some damage. The Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 also did some damage to parts of the city.

=== Cityscape ===
San Jose&#x27;s expansion was made by the design of &quot;Dutch&quot; Hamann, the City Manager from 1950 to 1969. During his administration, with his staff referred to as &quot;Dutch&#x27;s Panzer Division&quot;, the city annexed property 1,389 times, growing the city from , absorbing the communities named above, changing their status to &quot;neighborhoods.&quot;

Sales taxes were a chief source of revenue. Hamann would determine where major shopping areas would be, and then annex narrow bands of land along major roadways leading to those locations, pushing &quot;tentacles&quot; or &quot;finger areas&quot; across the Santa Clara Valley and, in turn, walling off the expansion of adjacent communities.

During his reign, it was said the City Council would vote according to Hamann&#x27;s nod. In 1963, the State of California imposed Local Agency Formation Commissions statewide, but largely to try to maintain order with San Jose&#x27;s aggressive growth. Eventually the political forces against growth grew as local neighborhoods bonded together to elect their own candidates, ending Hamann&#x27;s influence and leading to his resignation. While the job was not complete, the trend was set. The city had defined its sphere of influence in all directions, sometimes chaotically leaving unincorporated pockets to be swallowed up by the behemoth, sometimes even at the objection of the residents.

Major thoroughfares in the city include Monterey Road, the Stevens Creek Boulevard/San Carlos Street corridor, Santa Clara Street/Alum Rock Avenue corridor, Almaden Expressway, Capitol Expressway, 1st Street (San Jose), and Lawrence Expy.

=== Topography ===

The Guadalupe River runs from the Santa Cruz Mountains flowing north through San Jose, ending in the San Francisco Bay at Alviso. Along the southern part of the river is the neighborhood of Almaden Valley, originally named for the mercury mines which produced mercury needed for gold extraction from quartz during the California gold rush as well as mercury fulminate blasting caps and detonators for the U.S. military from 1870 to 1945. East of the Guadalupe River, Coyote Creek also flows to south San Francisco Bay and originates on Mount Sizer near Henry W. Coe State Park and the surrounding hills in the Diablo Range, northeast of Morgan Hill, California.

The lowest point in San Jose is below sea level at the San Francisco Bay in Alviso; the highest is . Because of the proximity to Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton, San Jose has taken several steps to reduce light pollution, including replacing all street lamps and outdoor lighting in private developments with low pressure sodium lamps. To recognize the city&#x27;s efforts, the asteroid 6216 San Jose was named after the city.

There are four distinct valleys in the city of San Jose: Almaden Valley, situated on the southwest fringe of the city; Evergreen Valley to the southeast, which is hilly all throughout its interior; Santa Clara Valley, which includes the flat, main urban expanse of the South Bay; and the rural Coyote Valley, to the city&#x27;s extreme southern fringe.

The extensive droughts in California, coupled with the drainage of the reservoir at Anderson Lake for seismic repairs, have strained the city&#x27;s water security. San Jose has suffered from lack of precipitation and water scarcity to the extent that some residents may run out of household water by the summer of 2022.

=== Climate ===
San Jose, like most of the Bay Area, has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;), with warm to hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. San Jose has an average of 298 days of sunshine and an annual mean temperature of . It lies inland, surrounded on three sides by mountains, and does not front the Pacific Ocean like San Francisco. As a result, the city is somewhat more sheltered from rain, barely avoiding a cold semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;) climate.

Like most of the Bay Area, San Jose is made up of dozens of microclimates. Because of a more prominent rain shadow from the Santa Cruz Mountains, Downtown San Jose experiences the lightest rainfall in the city, while South San Jose, only distant, experiences more rainfall, and somewhat more extreme temperatures.

The monthly daily average temperature ranges from around in December and January to around in July and August. The highest temperature ever recorded in San Jose was on September 6, 2022; the lowest was on January 6, 1894. On average, there are 2.7 mornings annually where the temperature drops to, or below, the freezing mark; and sixteen afternoons where the high reaches or exceeds . Diurnal temperature variation is far wider than along the coast or in San Francisco but still a shadow of what is seen in the Central Valley.

&quot;Rain year&quot; precipitation has ranged from between July 1876 and June 1877 to between July 1889 and June 1890, although at the current site since 1893 the range is from in &quot;rain year&quot; 2020–21 to in &quot;rain year&quot; 1982–83. 2020-2021 was the lowest precipitation year ever, in 127 years of precipitation records in San Jose. The most precipitation in one month was in January 1911. The maximum 24-hour rainfall was on January 30, 1968. On August 16, 2020, one of the most widespread and strong thunderstorm events in recent Bay Area history occurred as an unstable humid air mass moved up from the south and triggered multiple dry thunderstorms which caused many fires to be ignited by 300+ lightning strikes in the surrounding hills. The CZU lightning complex fires took almost 5 months to fully be controlled. Over 86,000 acres were burned and nearly 1500 buildings were destroyed.

The snow level drops as low as above sea level, or lower, occasionally coating nearby Mount Hamilton and, less frequently, the Santa Cruz Mountains, with snow that normally lasts a few days. Snow will snarl traffic traveling on State Route 17 towards Santa Cruz. Snow rarely falls in San Jose; the most recent snow to remain on the ground was on February 5, 1976, when many residents around the city saw as much as on car and roof tops. The official observation station measured only of snow.

===Neighborhoods and districts===
The city is generally divided into the following areas: Central San Jose (centered on Downtown San Jose), West San Jose, North San Jose, East San Jose, and South San Jose. Many of San Jose&#x27;s districts and neighborhoods were previously unincorporated communities or separate municipalities that were later annexed by the city.

Besides those mentioned above, some well-known communities within San Jose include Japantown, Rose Garden, Midtown San Jose, Willow Glen, Naglee Park, Burbank, Winchester, Alviso, East Foothills, Alum Rock, Communications Hill, Little Portugal, Blossom Valley, Cambrian, Almaden Valley, Little Saigon, Silver Creek Valley, Evergreen Valley, Mayfair, Edenvale, Santa Teresa, Seven Trees, Coyote Valley, and Berryessa.
A distinct ethnic enclave in San Jose is the Washington-Guadalupe neighborhood, immediately south of the SoFA District; this neighborhood is home to a community of Hispanics, centered on Willow Street.
=== Parks ===
 

San Jose possesses about of parkland in its city limits, including a part of the expansive Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The city&#x27;s oldest park is Alum Rock Park, established in 1872.

==== Trails ====
San Jose&#x27;s trail network of of recreational and active transportation trails throughout the city. The major trails in the network include:
* Coyote Creek Trail
* Guadalupe River Trail
* Los Gatos Creek Trail
* Los Alamitos Creek Trail
* Penitencia Creek Trail
* Silver Creek Valley Trail

This large urban trail network, recognized by Prevention Magazine as the nation&#x27;s largest, is linked to trails in surrounding jurisdictions and many rural trails in surrounding open space and foothills. Several trail systems within the network are designated as part of the National Recreation Trail, as well as regional trails such as the San Francisco Bay Trail and Bay Area Ridge Trail.

==== Wildlife ====
Early written documents record the local presence of migrating salmon in the Rio Guadalupe dating as far back as the 18th century. Both steelhead (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) and King salmon are extant in the Guadalupe River, making San Jose the southernmost major U. S. city with known salmon spawning runs, the other cities being Anchorage; Seattle; Portland and Sacramento. Runs of up to 1,000 Chinook or King Salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;) swam up the Guadalupe River each fall in the 1990s, but have all but vanished in the current decade apparently blocked from access to breeding grounds by impassable culverts, weirs and wide, exposed and flat concrete paved channels installed by the Santa Clara Valley Water District. In 2011 a small number of Chinook salmon were filmed spawning under the Julian Street bridge.

Conservationist Roger Castillo, who discovered the remains of a mammoth on the banks of the Guadalupe River in 2005, found that a herd of tule elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;) had recolonized the hills of south San Jose east of Highway 101 in early 2019.

At the southern edge of San José, Coyote Valley is a corridor for wildlife migration between the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Diablo Range.

== Demographics ==
In 2022, the US Census Bureau released its new population estimates. With a total population of 971,233, San Jose showed a 4.1% decline in population since the 2020 census. Some reasons for this decline are people leaving the area for more affordable cities and more remote working opportunities.

The seller, Connecticut-based Five Mile Capital Partners, paid $40 million for the site in 2010.

===Wealth===
San Jose is situated in the most affluent county in California and one of the most affluent counties in the United States.

With a median home price of $1,085,000 and the highest percentage of million-dollar (or more) homes in the United States, San Jose has the most expensive housing market in the United States and the fifth most expensive housing market in the world.

The cost of living in San Jose and the surrounding areas is among the highest in California and the nation, according to 2004 data. Housing costs are the primary reason for the high cost of living, although the costs in all areas tracked by the ACCRA Cost of Living Index are above the national average. Households in the city limits have the highest disposable income of any city in the U.S. with over 500,000 residents.

=== Silicon Valley ===

The large concentration of high-technology engineering, computer, and microprocessor companies around San Jose has led the area to be known as Silicon Valley. Area schools such as the University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Santa Cruz, San Jose State University, San Francisco State University, California State University, East Bay, Santa Clara University, and Stanford University pump thousands of engineering and computer science graduates into the local economy every year.

San Jose residents produce more U.S. patents than any other city. On October 15, 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office opened a satellite office in San Jose to serve Silicon Valley and the Western United States. By April 2018, Google was in the process of planning the &quot;biggest tech campus in Silicon Valley&quot; in San Jose. However, in April 2023, it was reported that Google paused on Google West San Jose Campus constructions due to slowing economic conditions and a decreased requirement for physical office space by tech companies, although the tech ecosystem has also recently become more geographically dispersed.

High economic growth during the tech bubble of the late 1990s led to elevated employment, housing prices, and traffic congestion. As the economy slowed in the early 2000s, employment and traffic congestion was somewhat diminished. In the mid-2000s, traffic along major highways again began to worsen as the economy improved. San Jose had 405,000 jobs within its city limits in 2006, and an unemployment rate of 4.6%. San Jose has the highest median income of any U.S. city with over 280,000 people.

On March 14, 2013, San Jose implemented a public wireless connection in its downtown area. Wireless access points have been placed on outdoor light posts throughout the city.

=== Media ===

San Jose is served by Greater Bay Area media. Print media outlets in San Jose include &quot;The Mercury News&quot;, the weekly &quot;Metro Silicon Valley&quot;, &quot;El Observador&quot; and the &quot;Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Journal&quot;. The Bay Area&#x27;s NBC O&amp;O, KNTV 11, is licensed to San Jose. In total, broadcasters in the Bay Area include 34 television stations, 25 AM radio stations, and 55 FM radio stations.

In April 1909, Charles David Herrold, an electronics instructor in San Jose, constructed a radio station to broadcast the human voice. The station, &quot;San Jose Calling&quot; (call letters FN, later FQW), was the world&#x27;s first radio station with scheduled programming targeted at a general audience. The station became the first to broadcast music in 1910. Herrold&#x27;s wife Sybil became the first female &quot;disk jockey&quot; in 1912. The station changed hands a number of times before becoming today&#x27;s KCBS in San Francisco.

=== Top employers ===
As of June 30, 2024, the top employers in the city were:

== Culture ==

=== Architecture ===
Because the downtown area is in the flight path to nearby San Jose Mineta International Airport (also evidenced in the above panoramic), there is a height limit for buildings in the downtown area, which is underneath the final approach corridor to the airport. The height limit is dictated by local ordinances, driven by the distance from the runway and a slope defined by Federal Aviation Administration regulations. Core downtown buildings are limited to approximately but can get taller farther from the airport.

There has been broad criticism over the past few decades of the city&#x27;s architecture. Citizens have complained that San Jose is lacking in aesthetically pleasing architectural styles. Blame for this lack of architectural &quot;beauty&quot; can be assigned to the re-development of the downtown area from the 1950s onward, in which whole blocks of historic commercial and residential structures were demolished. Exceptions to this include the Downtown Historic District, the Hotel De Anza, and the Hotel Sainte Claire, both of which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places for their architectural and historical significance.

Municipal building projects have experimented more with architectural styles than have most private enterprises. The Children&#x27;s Discovery Museum, Tech Museum of Innovation, and the San Jose Repertory Theater building have experimented with bold colors and unusual exteriors. The new City Hall, designed by Richard Meier &amp; Partners, opened in 2005 and is a notable addition to the growing collection of municipal building projects.

San Jose has many examples of houses with fine architecture. Late 19th century and early 20th century styles exist in neighborhoods such as Hanchett Park, Naglee Park, Rose Garden, and Willow Glen (including Palm Haven).

Styles include Mediterranean Revival architecture, Spanish Colonial architecture, Neoclassical architecture, Craftsman, Mission Revival, Prairie style, and Queen Anne style Victorian.

Notable architects include Frank Delos Wolfe, Theodore Lenzen, Charles McKenzie, and Julia Morgan.

=== Visual arts ===
Public art is an evolving attraction in the city. The city was one of the first to adopt a public art ordinance at 2% of capital improvement building project budgets, and as a result of this commitment, a considerable number of public art projects exist in the downtown area, and a growing collection in neighborhoods including libraries, parks, and fire stations. In particular, the Mineta Airport expansion incorporated art and technology into its development.

Early public art included a statue of Quetzalcoatl (the plumed serpent) downtown, controversial in its planning because some called it pagan, and controversial in its implementation because many felt that the final statue by Robert Graham did not look like a winged serpent, and was more noted for its expense than its aesthetics. Locals joked that the statue resembles a pile of feces.

A statue of Thomas Fallon also met strong resistance from those who called him largely responsible for the decimation of early native populations. Chicano/Latino activists protested because he had captured San Jose by military force in the Mexican–American War (1846). They also protested the perceived &quot;repression&quot; of historic documents detailing Fallon&#x27;s orders expelling many of the city&#x27;s Californio (early Spanish/Mexican/Mestizo) residents. In October 1991 protests at Columbus Day and Dia de la Raza celebrations stalled than plan, and the statue was stored in a warehouse in Oakland for more than a decade. The statue returned in 2002 to a less conspicuous location: Pellier Park, a small triangular patch at the merge of West Julian and West St. James streets.

In 2001, the city-sponsored SharkByte, an exhibit of decorated sharks based on the mascot of the hockey team, the San Jose Sharks, and modeled after Chicago&#x27;s display of decorated cows. Large models of sharks decorated in clever, colorful, or creative ways by local artists were displayed for months at dozens of locations around the city. After the exhibition, the sharks were auctioned off for charity.

In 2006, Adobe Systems commissioned an art installation titled &quot;San Jose Semaphore&quot; by Ben Rubin, at the top of its headquarters building. Semaphore is composed of four LED discs which &quot;rotate&quot; to transmit a message. The content remained a mystery until it was deciphered in August 2007. The visual art installation is supplemented with an audio track, transmitted from the building on a low-power AM station. The audio track provides clues to decode the message being transmitted.

San Jose retains a number of murals in the Chicano history tradition of Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco of murals as public textbooks.

Although intended to be permanent monuments to the city&#x27;s heritage as a mission town founded in 1777, a number of murals have been painted over, notably &quot;Mural de la Raza&quot;, on the side of a Story Rd shoe store, and &quot;Mexicatlan&quot; at the corner of Sunset and Alum Rock. In addition, two of three murals by Mexican artist Gustavo Bernal Navarro have disappeared. The third mural, &quot;La Medicina y la Comunidad&quot; at the Gardner clinic on East Virginia Street, depicts both modern and traditional healers.

Surviving Chicano history murals include &quot;Nuestra Senora de Guadelupe&quot; at Our Lady of Guadalupe church and the 1970s or 1980s &quot;Virgen de Guadelupe Huelga Bird&quot; at Cal Foods east of downtown. The Guadalajara restaurant has the 1986 &quot;Guadalajara Market No. 2&quot; by Edward Earl Tarver III and a 2013 work by Jesus Rodriguez and Empire 7, &quot;La Gran Culture Resonance&quot;.

An unknown artist painted the &quot;Huelga Bird and Aztec City&quot; mural in the 1970s or 1980s on the Clyde L. Fisher Middle School. In 1995 Antonio Nava Torres painted &quot;The Aztec Calendar Handball Court&quot; at Biebrach Park, and the unknown artist of &quot;Chaco&#x27;s Pachuco&quot; painted it on the former Chaco&#x27;s Restaurant in the 1990s. The &quot;Jerry Hernandez&quot; mural by Frank Torres at Pop&#x27;s Mini Mart on King Road dates to 2009, and another recent mural by Carlos Rodriguez on the Sidhu Market at Locust and West Virginia depicts a stern-looking warrior.

=== Performing arts ===
The city is home to many performing arts companies, including Opera San Jose, Symphony Silicon Valley, Ballet San Jose Silicon Valley, sjDANCEco, The San Jose Symphonic Choir, Children&#x27;s Musical Theater San Jose, the San Jose Youth Symphony, the San Jose Repertory Theatre, City Lights Theatre Company, The Tabard Theatre Company, San Jose Stage Company, and the now-defunct American Musical Theatre of San Jose which was replaced by Broadway San Jose in partnership with Team San Jose. San Jose is also home to the San Jose Museum of Art, one of the nation&#x27;s premiere Modern Art museums.

The SAP Center at San Jose is one of the most active venues for events in the world. According to Billboard Magazine and Pollstar, the arena sold the most tickets to non-sporting events of any venue in the United States, and third in the world after the Manchester Evening News Arena in Manchester, England, and the Bell Centre in Montreal, Canada, for the period from January 1September 30, 2004.

The annual Cinequest Film Festival in downtown has grown to over 60,000 attendees per year, becoming an important festival for independent films. The San Francisco Asian American Film Festival is an annual event, which is hosted in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Downtown San Jose. Approximately 30 to 40 films are screened in San Jose each year at the Camera 12 Downtown Cinemas. The San Jose Jazz Festival is another of many events hosted throughout the year.

The Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies houses the largest collection of Ludwig van Beethoven in the world, outside of Europe, and is the only institution of its kind in North America.

=== Sports ===

San Jose is home to the San Jose Sharks of the NHL, the San Jose Barracuda of the AHL, and the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer. The Sharks and the Barracuda play in the SAP Center at San Jose. The Earthquakes built an 18,000 seat new stadium that opened in March 2015. San Jose was a founding member of both the California League and Pacific Coast League in minor league baseball. San Jose currently fields the San Jose Giants, a Low-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants.

San Jose has been host to several U.S. Olympic team trials over the years. In 2004, the San Jose Sports Authority held the trials for judo, taekwondo, trampolining and rhythmic gymnastics at the San Jose State Event Center. SAP Center hosted the Gymnastic trials in 2012 and 2016 (women&#x27;s only). and the U.S. Figure Skating Championships (used in Olympic years to select the Olympians) in 1996, 2012, and 2018. It was due to host the 2021 Championship, but that was moved to Las Vegas and it will instead host 2023. In 2008, around 90 percent of the members of the United States Olympic team were processed at San Jose State University prior to traveling to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2009 Junior Olympics for trampoline were also held here.

In August 2004, the San Jose Seahawk Rugby Football Club hosted the USA All-Star Rugby Sevens Championships at Watson Bowl, east of Downtown.
San Jose State hosted the 2011 American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) national tournament. The NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament is also frequently held in San Jose.

From 2005 to 2007, the San Jose Grand Prix, an annual street circuit race in the Champ Car World Series, was held in the downtown area. Other races included the Trans-Am Series, the Toyota Atlantic Championship, the United States Touring Car Championship, the Historic Stock Car Racing Series, and the Formula D Drift racing competition.

In the 2010s, San Jose &quot;aggressively wooed&quot; the Oakland Athletics to relocate to San Jose from nearby Oakland, but the San Francisco Giants exercised a veto against this proposal. In 2013, the city of San Jose sued Major League Baseball for not allowing the Athletics to relocate to San Jose. On October 5, 2015, the United States Supreme Court rejected San Jose&#x27;s bid on the Athletics, who in 2023 announced they would relocate to Las Vegas.

== Law and government ==


=== Local ===
San Jose is a charter city under California law, giving it the power to enact local ordinances that may conflict with state law, within the limits provided by the charter. The city has a council-manager government with a city manager nominated by the mayor and elected by the city council.

The San Jose City Council is made up of ten council members elected by district, and a mayor elected by the entire city. During city council meetings, the mayor presides, and all eleven members can vote on any issue. The mayor has no veto powers. Council members and the mayor are elected to four-year terms; the even-numbered district council members beginning in 1994; the mayor and the odd-numbered district council members beginning in 1996. Each council member represents approximately 100,000 constituents.

Council members and the mayor are limited to two successive terms in office, although a council member that has reached the term limit can be elected mayor, and vice versa. The council elects a vice-mayor from the members of the council at the second meeting of the year following a council election. This council member acts as mayor during the temporary absence of the mayor, but does not succeed to the mayor&#x27;s office upon a vacancy.

The city manager is the chief administrative officer of the city, and must present an annual budget for approval by the city council. When the office is vacant, the mayor proposes a candidate for City Manager, subject to council approval. The council appoints the manager for an indefinite term, and may at any time remove the manager, or the electorate may remove the manager through a recall election. Other city officers directly appointed by the council include the City Attorney, City Auditor, City Clerk, and Independent Police Auditor. Like all cities and counties in the state, San Jose has representation in the state legislature.

Like all California cities except San Francisco, both the levels and the boundaries of what the city government controls are determined by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). The goal of a LAFCO is to try to avoid uncontrolled urban sprawl. The Santa Clara County LAFCO has set boundaries of San Jose&#x27;s &quot;Sphere of Influence&quot; (indicated by the blue line in the map near the top of the page) as a superset of the actual city limits (the yellow area in the map), plus parts of the surrounding unincorporated county land, where San Jose can, for example, prevent development of fringe areas to concentrate city growth closer to the city&#x27;s core. The LAFCO also defines a subset of the Sphere as an &#x27;Urban Service Area&#x27; (indicated by the red line in the map), effectively limiting development to areas where urban infrastructure (sewers, electrical service, etc.) already exists.

San Jose is the county seat of Santa Clara County. Accordingly, many county government facilities are located in the city, including the office of the County Executive, the Board of Supervisors, the District Attorney&#x27;s Office, eight courthouses of the Superior Court, the Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and the County Clerk.

San Jose is protected by the San Jose Police Department and San Jose Fire Department. Drinking water is supplied by the San José Municipal Water System (Muni Water) along with the privately owned San Jose Water Company and Great Oaks Water Company. The San José–Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility provides advanced wastewater treatment and reclaimed water.

=== State and federal ===

In the California State Senate, San Jose is split between the 10th, 15th, and 17th districts, represented by , , and respectively.

In the California State Assembly, San Jose is split between the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, and 28th districts, represented by , , , , and , respectively.

Federally, San Jose is split between California&#x27;s 17th, 18th, and 19th congressional districts, represented by , , and , respectively.

Several state and federal agencies maintain offices in San Jose. The city is the location of the Sixth District of the California Courts of Appeal. It is also home to one of three courthouses of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the other two being in Oakland and San Francisco.

=== Crime ===

Like most large cities, crime levels had fallen significantly after rising in the 1980s. From 2002 to 2006, Morgan Quitno Press named San Jose the safest city in the United States with a population over 500,000 people. Crime in San Jose had been lower than in other large American cities until 2013, when crime rates in San Jose climbed above California and U.S. averages.

In 2020, violent crime per 100,000 people has been the lowest the city has seen in 2017 while the homicide rate has been the highest since 2016; property crime per 100,000 people has been the lowest the city has seen in over ten years.

;2021 mass shooting

On May 26, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) rail yard in San Jose. Ten people were killed, including the gunman, 57-year-old VTA employee Samuel James Cassidy, who shot and killed himself. The shooting led to a day-long suspension of light rail services in the area. It is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the San Francisco Bay Area.

In June 2021, roughly a month following the shooting, San Jose became the first city in the United States to require gun owners to carry liability insurance after a unanimous vote by the city council.

== Education ==

=== Higher education ===

San Jose is home to several colleges and universities. The largest is San José State University, which was founded by the California legislature in 1862 as the California State Normal School, and is the founding campus of the California State University (CSU) system. Located in downtown San Jose since 1870, the university enrolls approximately 35,000 students in over 250 different bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degree programs.

The school enjoys a good academic reputation, especially in the fields of engineering, business, computer science, art and design, and journalism. San Jose State is one of only three Bay Area schools that fields a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Division I college football team; Stanford University and U.C. Berkeley are the other two.

California University of Management and Technology (CALMAT) offers many degree programs, including MBA, Computer Science, Information Technology. Most classes are offered both online and in the downtown campus. Many of the students are working professionals in the Silicon Valley.

The University of Silicon Valley is located in the Golden Triangle of North San Jose.

Lincoln Law School of San Jose and University of Silicon Valley Law School offer law degrees, catering to working professionals.

National University maintains a campus in San Jose.

The San Jose campus of Golden Gate University offers business bachelor and MBA degrees.

In the San Jose metropolitan area, Stanford University is in Stanford, California, Santa Clara University is in Santa Clara, California, and U.C. Santa Cruz is in Santa Cruz, California. Within the San Francisco Bay Area, other universities include U.C. Berkeley, U.C. San Francisco, U.C. Hastings College of Law, University of San Francisco, and California State University, East Bay.

The San Jose area&#x27;s community colleges, San Jose City College, West Valley College, Mission College and Evergreen Valley College, offer associate degrees, general education units to transfer to CSU and UC schools, and adult and continuing education programs. The West campus of Palmer College of Chiropractic is also located in San Jose.

WestMed College is headquartered in San Jose and offers paramedic training, emergency medical technician training, and licensed vocational nursing programs.

The University of California operates Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton.

Western Seminary has one of its four campuses in San Jose, which opened on the campus of Calvary Church of Los Gatos in 1985. The campus relocated in 2010 to Santa Clara. Western is an evangelical, Christian graduate school that provides theological training for students who hope to serve in a variety of ministry roles including pastors, marriage and family therapists, educators, missionaries and lay leadership. The San Jose campus offers four master&#x27;s degrees, and a variety of other graduate-level programs.

National Hispanic University offered associate and bachelor&#x27;s degrees and teaching credentials to its students, focusing on Hispanic students, until its closing in 2015.

=== Primary and secondary education ===
Until the opening of Lincoln High School in 1943, San Jose students only attended San Jose High School. San Jose has 127 elementary, 47 middle, and 44 public high schools.

Public education in the city is provided by four high school districts, fourteen elementary districts, and three unified school districts (which provide both elementary and high schools).
* Unified school districts include: San Jose USD (SJUSD), Morgan Hill USD, and Santa Clara USD 
* Secondary school districts include: Campbell UHSD, East Side UHSD, Fremont UHSD, and Los Gatos-Saratoga JUSD
* Elementary school districts include: Alum Rock UESD, Berryessa UESD, Cambrian ESD, Campbell UESD, Cupertino UESD, Evergreen ESD, Franklin-McKinley ESD, Los Gatos UESD, Luther Burbank ESD, Moreland SD, Mount Pleasant ESD, Oak Grove ESD, Orchard ESD, and Union ESD.

SJUSD declared bankruptcy in 1983; at that time, it was the largest US school district to declare bankruptcy. Observers identified the reasons as a drop of 5,000 students in the preceding years, the difficulties imposed on school finances by &quot;Serrano v. Priest&quot; in 1968, the reduction of tax monies because of 1978 California Proposition 13, and the local teachers&#x27; union contract requiring a raise in pay.

Private schools in San Jose are primarily run by religious groups. The Catholic Diocese of San Jose has the second-largest student population in Santa Clara County, behind only SJUSD; the diocese and its parishes operate several schools in the city, including five high schools. Other private religious schools are Baptist, non-denominational Protestant, and Wisconsin Synod Lutheran. Secular private schools include Cambrian Academy and Harker School.

=== Libraries ===
The San José Public Library system is unique in that the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library combines the collections of the city&#x27;s system with the San Jose State University main library. In 2003, construction of the library, which now holds more than 1.6 million items, was the largest single library construction project west of the Mississippi, with eight floors that result in more than of space with a capacity for 2 million volumes.

The city has 23 neighborhood branches including the &quot;Biblioteca Latinoamericana&quot; (&#x27;Latin American Library&#x27;) which specializes in Spanish language works. The East San Jose Carnegie Branch Library, a Carnegie library opened in 1908, is the last Carnegie library in Santa Clara County still operating as a public library and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As the result of a bond measure passed in November 2000, a number of brand new or completely reconstructed branches have been completed and opened. The yet-to-be-named brand new Southeast Branch is also planned, bringing the bond library project to its completion.

The San Jose system (along with the university system) were jointly named as &quot;Library of the Year&quot; by &quot;Library Journal&quot; in 2004.

== Transportation ==
Like other American cities built mostly after World War II, San Jose is highly automobile-dependent, with 76 percent of residents driving alone to work and 12 percent carpooling in 2017. The city set an ambitious goal to shift motorized trips to walking, bicycling, and public transit in 2009 with the adoption of its Envision San Jose 2040 General Plan. In 2018, the city extended these goals to 2050 with its San Jose Climate Smart plan.

=== Public transit ===

Rail service to and from San Jose is provided by Amtrak (the Sacramento–San-Jose Capitol Corridor and the Seattle–Los-Angeles Coast Starlight), Caltrain (commuter rail service between San Francisco and Gilroy), ACE (commuter rail service to Pleasanton and Stockton), and the local VTA light rail system connecting downtown to Mountain View, Milpitas, Campbell, and Almaden Valley, operated by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). Historic streetcars from History Park operate on the light rail lines in downtown during holidays.

Long-term plans call for BART to be expanded to Santa Clara from the Berryessa/North San José station. Originally, the extension was to be built all at once, but due to the recession, sales tax revenue has dramatically decreased. Because of this, the extension will be built in two phases. Phase 1 extended service to San Jose with the completion of the Milpitas and Berryessa BART stations on June 13, 2020. In addition, San Jose will be a major stop on the future California High-Speed Rail route between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Diridon Station (formerly Cahill Depot, 65 Cahill Street) is the meeting point of all regional commuter rail service in the area. It was built in 1935 by the Southern Pacific Railroad, and was refurbished in 1994.

VTA also operates many bus routes in San Jose and the surrounding communities, as well as offering paratransit services to local residents. Additionally, the Highway 17 Express bus line connects central San Jose with Santa Cruz. Intercity bus providers include Greyhound, BoltBus, Megabus, California Shuttle Bus, TUFESA, Intercalifornias, Hoang, and USAsia. FlixBus also services the city with a stop at 129 W San Carlos.

=== Air ===
San Jose is served by Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport northwest of downtown, and by Reid-Hillview Airport of Santa Clara County, general aviation airport located in the eastern part of San Jose. San Jose residents also use San Francisco International Airport, a major international hub located to the northwest, and Oakland International Airport, another major international airport located to the north. The airport is also near the intersections of three major freeways, US 101, I-880, and SR 87.

=== Highways ===
The San Jose area is served by a freeway system that includes three Interstate freeways and one U.S. Route. It is, however, the largest city in the country not served by a primary (one- or two-digit route number) Interstate; most of the Interstate Highway Network was planned by the early 1950s well before San Jose&#x27;s rapid growth decades later.

US 101 runs south to the California Central Coast and Los Angeles, and then runs north up near the eastern shore of the San Francisco Peninsula to San Francisco. I-280 also heads to San Francisco, but goes along just to the west of the cities of the San Francisco Peninsula. I-880 heads north to Oakland, running parallel to the southeastern shore of San Francisco Bay. I-680 parallels I-880 to Fremont, but then cuts northeast to the eastern cities of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Several state highways also serve San Jose: SR 17, SR 85, SR 87 and SR 237. Additionally, San Jose is served by a system of county-wide expressways, which includes the Almaden Expressway, Capitol Expressway, San Tomas Expressway, and Lawrence Expressway.

Several regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to manage congestion on San Jose freeways. This includes expanding State Route 87 to add more lanes near the downtown San Jose area.

The interchange for I-280 connecting with I-680 and U.S. 101 was named the Joe Colla Interchange.

Major highways:

* I-280
* I-680
* I-880
* US 101
* SR 17
* SR 82
* SR 85
* SR 87
* SR 130
* SR 237
=== Bicycling ===
Central San Jose has seen a gradual expansion of bike lanes over the past decade, which now comprise a network of car-traffic-separated and buffered bike lanes. San Jose Bike Party is a volunteer-run monthly social cycling event that attracts up to 1,000 participants during summer months to &quot;build community through bicycling&quot;. Fewer than one percent of city residents ride bicycles to work as their primary mode of transportation, a statistic unchanged in the past ten years. Typically, between three and five residents are struck and killed by car drivers while bicycling on San Jose streets each year.

== Sister cities ==
San Jose has one of the oldest Sister City programs in the nation. In 1957, when the city established a relationship with Okayama, Japan, it was only the third Sister City relationship in the nation, which had begun the prior year. The Office of Economic Development coordinates the San Jose Sister City Program which is part of Sister Cities International. , there are eight sister cities:

* Okayama, Japan (established on May 26, 1957)
* San José, Costa Rica (1961)
* Veracruz, Mexico (1975)
* Tainan, Taiwan (1977)
* Dublin, Ireland (1986)

<text>APNIC (the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre) is the regional Internet address registry (RIR) for the Asia–Pacific region. It is one of the world&#x27;s five RIRs and is part of the Number Resource Organization (NRO).

APNIC provides numbers resource allocation and registration services that support the global operation of the internet. It is a nonprofit, membership-based organization whose members include Internet service providers, telecommunication providers, data centers, universities, banks, national Internet registries, and similar organizations that have their own networks.

== Functions ==
APNIC&#x27;s main functions are:

* Allocating IPv4 and IPv6 address space, and autonomous system numbers
* Maintaining the public APNIC Whois Database for the Asia Pacific region,
* Reverse DNS delegations
* Training in technical skills
* Representing the interests of the Asia Pacific Internet community on the global stage

APNIC manages Internet number resources according to policies developed through an open process of consultation and consensus called the Policy Development Process (PDP).

== APNIC PDP ==
APNIC&#x27;s policies are developed by the membership and the broader Internet community. The forums for policy development are the face-to-face Open Policy Meetings, which are held twice each year, and the public mailing list discussions of the Special Internet Groups.

APNIC&#x27;s open PDP also invites stakeholders interested in Internet number resources from around the world (but mostly the Asia Pacific) to participate. These include representatives from governments, regulators, educators, media, the technical community, civil society, and other not-for-profit organizations.

APNIC&#x27;s PDP is:

* Open
** Anyone can propose policies.
** Everyone can discuss policy proposals.
* Transparent
** APNIC publicly documents all policy discussions and decisions.
* Bottom-up
** The community drives policy development.

== Structure ==
Elections are held at each APNIC Annual General Meeting (AGM), which is conducted during the APNIC Member Meeting (AMM) in February. Voting takes place both on-site at these meetings and prior to the meeting via online voting.

=== APNIC Executive Council ===
Each APNIC Executive Council (EC) member serves as an individual, not as a representative of any other party or Member. Therefore, they must act at all times in the best interests of APNIC. The APNIC EC meets face-to-face at four regularly scheduled meetings per year.

=== APNIC Secretariat ===
The APNIC Secretariat operates to serve its Members and the Asia Pacific Internet community stakeholders.

Its activities are designed to help the APNIC community achieve APNIC&#x27;s objectives. The Secretariat (APNIC&#x27;s staff) carries out the day-to-day work. The Secretariat is structured in five divisions: Services, Technical, Business, Communications, and Learning &amp; Development. These divisions encompass all APNIC activities, including that of acting as a central source of information for Members.

== Core services ==
=== Internet number resource delegation ===
APNIC delegates IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) and (ASNs) according to policies developed by the APNIC community. All IP and AS number delegation is subject to certain criteria, based on demonstrated need.

=== APNIC Whois Database ===
The APNIC Whois Database details of IP addresses and AS numbers originally allocated by APNIC. It shows the organizations that hold the resources, where the allocations were made, and contact details for the networks. Users can search the whois for information pertaining to these resources, for network troubleshooting, or helping to track network abuse. The organizations that hold those resources are responsible for updating their information in the database. Internet number resources must be properly and accurately registered to fulfil the goals of addressing policy as outlined by the Public Technical Identifiers (PTI), who are responsible for the operation of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions.

This accurate registration of resource usage is a critical role APNIC plays in the operation of the Internet.

The database can be searched by using the web interface on the APNIC site, or by directing your whois client to whois.apnic.net (for example, whois -h whois.apnic.net 203.37.255.97).

=== RDAP ===
APNIC provides an alternative to the whois called the Registration Data Access protocol (RDAP), which was designed to address issues in the whois service, the most important of which are: standardization of queries and responses; internalization considerations to cater for languages other than English in data objects; and redirection capabilities to allow seamless referrals to other registrations.

=== Network abuse ===
For network abuse such as spam or (hacking), people mistakenly interpret references to apnic.net when doing a whois search to indicate that APNIC is the source of the abuse. Instead, these references to APNIC simply mean that the address space in question was delegated by APNIC to an organization within the Asia Pacific region. APNIC has no authority to prevent these kinds of network abuse.

APNIC also has no technical ability to &#x27;suspend&#x27; an Internet service, no mandate to withdraw address registrations, no investigative powers, nor any authority to take action as an enforcement agency. APNIC is in the same position as any other IP address or DNS registry worldwide.

=== Reverse DNS delegation ===
APNIC manages reverse DNS delegations for both IPv4 and IPv6. APNIC only delegates the authority of reverse zones to the DNS name servers provided through domain objects.

=== Resource Certification ===
APNIC provides a Resource Certification service, which is a robust security framework used to verify the association between specific IP address blocks of ASNs and the holders of those Internet number resources. APNIC introduced Resource Certification to improve inter-domain security in the region and enhance the value of the data in the APNIC Whois Database with verification of the resource holder&#x27;s right-of-use.

Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is the validation structure for Resource Certification that enables public network users to verify the authenticity of data that has been digitally signed by the data originator.

== Other services ==
=== APNIC training ===
APNIC conducts a number of training courses in a wide variety of locations around the region. These courses are designed to educate participants to proficiently configure, manage and administer their Internet services and infrastructure and to embrace current best practices.

=== Technical conferences ===
APNIC holds two conferences a year in various locations around the Asia Pacific region. The first one is held with the Asia Pacific Regional Internet Conference on Operational Technologies (APRICOT) and the second one is a stand-alone conference. Both events have a series of workshop sessions on topics such as routing, IPv6, and network security, and plenary and conference tracks on operational topics of current interest.

=== Conference schedule ===
=== Research ===
APNIC Labs provide research, measurement, and technical reports on the use of Internet number resources within the Internet, for example, IPv6 deployment.

== APNIC Foundation ==
The APNIC Foundation is a charity established to raise funds independently from APNIC Member contributions to support and expand Internet development efforts in the Asia Pacific.

== Partners ==
APNIC works closely with many other Internet organizations, including:

=== The APNIC membership ===
Major Internet Service Providers (ISPs), National Internet Registries (NIRs) and Network Information Centres (NICs).

=== Other Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) ===
ARIN (North America), LACNIC (Latin America and the Caribbean), RIPE NCC (Europe), and AFRINIC (Africa).

=== The Number Resource Organization ===
With the other RIRs, APNIC is a member of the Number Resource Organization (NRO), which exists to protect the unallocated number resource pool, to promote and protect the bottom-up policy development process, and to be the focal point for input into the RIR system.

=== Other leading Internet organizations ===
These include the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet Engineering and Planning Group (IEPG), the Internet Society (ISOC), and others.

The previous registry for Australia, known as AUNIC, is now disbanded, and its responsibilities undertaken by APNIC.

== History ==
APNIC was established in 1992, by the Asia Pacific Coordinating Committee for Intercontinental Research Networks (APCCIRN) and the Asia Pacific Engineering and Planning Group (APEPG). These two groups were later amalgamated and renamed the Asia Pacific Networking Group (APNG). It was established as a pilot project to administer address space as defined by RFC-1366, as well as encompassing a wider brief: &quot;To facilitate communication, business, and culture using Internet technologies&quot;.

In 1993, APNG discovered they were unable to provide a formal umbrella or legal structure for APNIC, and so the pilot project was concluded, but APNIC continued to exist independently under the authority of IANA as an &#x27;interim project&#x27;. At this stage, APNIC still lacked legal rights, a membership, and a fee structure.

In February 1995, the inaugural APNIC meeting was held in Bangkok, marking the beginning of the formalisation of APNIC. This was a two-day meeting, run by volunteers, and was free to attend. Voluntary donations were sought according to the size of the organization, ranging from US$1,500 for &#x27;small&#x27;, through to US$10,000 for &#x27;large&#x27;. Three member types were defined by APNIC-001: ISP (local IR), Enterprise, and National.

1996 saw a proper fee structure introduced, the establishment of a membership, and the holding of the first APRICOT meeting.

By the time 1997 rolled around, it was becoming increasingly clear that APNIC&#x27;s local environment in Japan was restricting its growth – for example, the staff was limited to 4–5 members. Therefore, the consulting firm KPMG was contracted to find an ideal location in the Asia Pacific region for APNIC&#x27;s new headquarters.

For reasons such as the stable infrastructure, the low cost of living and operation, and tax advantages for membership organizations, Brisbane, Australia was chosen as the new location, and relocation was completed between April and August 1998, while maintaining continuous operation throughout.

By 1999, the relocation was complete, the Asian economic crisis ended, and so began a period of consolidation for APNIC – a period of sustained growth, policy development, and the creation of documentation and internal systems.

Since then, APNIC has continued to grow from its humble beginnings to a membership of more than 7,700 in 56 economies throughout the region and a secretariat of around 88 staff members located in the head office in Brisbane, Australia.

<text>Hegemony (, , ) is the political, economic, and military predominance of one state over other states, either regional or global.

In Ancient Greece (ca. 8th BC – AD 6th c.), hegemony denoted the politico-military dominance of the &quot;hegemon&quot; city-state over other city-states. In the 19th century, &quot;hegemony&quot; denoted the &quot;social or cultural predominance or ascendancy; predominance by one group within a society or milieu&quot; and &quot;a group or regime which exerts undue influence within a society&quot;.

In theories of imperialism, the hegemonic order dictates the internal politics and the societal character of the subordinate states that constitute the hegemonic sphere of influence, either by an internal, sponsored government or by an external, installed government. The term &quot;hegemonism&quot; denoted the geopolitical and the cultural predominance of one country over other countries, e.g. the hegemony of the Great Powers established with European colonialism in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In International Relations theories, hegemony is distinguished from empire as ruling only external but not internal affairs of other states.

==Etymology==

From the post-classical Latin word (1513 or earlier) from the Greek word , related to the word , , .

==Historical examples==
=== 30th–27th centuries BC ===
The political pattern of Sumer was hegemony shifting from city to city and called King of Kish. According to the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot;, Kish established the hegemony yet before the Flood. One of the earliest literary legacies of humankind, the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, is a case of anti-hegemonic resistance. Gilgamesh fights and overthrows the hegemon of his world.

=== 8th–3rd centuries BC ===
In the Greek world of 5th century BC, the city-state of Sparta was the &quot;hegemon&quot; of the Peloponnesian League (6th to 4th centuries BC) and King Philip II of Macedon was the hegemon of the League of Corinth in 337 BC (a kingship he willed to his son, Alexander the Great). Likewise, the role of Athens within the short-lived Delian League (478–404 BC) was that of a &quot;hegemon&quot;. The super-regional Persian Achaemenid Empire of 550 BC–330 BC dominated these sub-regional hegemonies prior to its collapse. Ancient historians such as Herodotus ( – ). Xenophon ( – 354 BC) and Ephorus ( – 330 BC) pioneered the use of the term &quot;hēgemonía&quot; in the modern sense of &quot;hegemony&quot;.

In Ancient East Asia, Chinese hegemony existed during the Spring and Autumn period (c. 770–480 BC), when the weakened rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty led to the relative autonomy of the Five Hegemons (&quot;Ba&quot; in Chinese []). The term is translated as &quot;lord protector&quot;, or &quot;lord of the covenants&quot;, or &quot;chief of the feudal lords&quot; and is described as intermediate between king of independent state and &quot;Emperor of All under Heaven&quot;. The hegemons were appointed by feudal lord conferences and were nominally obliged to support the King of Zhou, whose status parallel to that of the Roman Pope in the medieval Europe.

In 364 BC, Qin emerged victorious from war and its Duke Xian (424–362 BC) was named hegemon by the King of Zhou. Qin rulers did not preserve the official title of hegemon but in fact kept the hegemony over their world: &quot;For more than one hundred years [before 221 BC] Qin commanded eight lands and brought the lord of equal rank to its court.&quot; One of the six other great powers, Wei, was annexed as early as 324 BC. From the reign of Duke Xian on, &quot;Qin gradually swallowed up the six [other] states until, after hundred years or so, the First Emperor was able to bring all kings under his power.&quot;

The century preceding the Qin&#x27;s wars of unification in 221 BC was dominated by confrontation between the hegemonic &quot;horizontal&quot; alliance led by Qin and the anti-hegemonic alliance called &quot;perpendicular&quot; or &quot;vertical&quot;. &quot;The political world appears as a chaos of ever-changing coalitions, but in which each new combination could ultimately be defined by its relation to Qin.&quot;

The first anti-hegemonic or &quot;perpendicular&quot; alliance was formed in 322 BC. Qin was supported by one state, Wei, which it had annexed two years previously. The remaining five great warring states of China joined in the anti-hegemonic coalition and attacked Qin in 318 BC. &quot;Qin, supported by one annexed state, overwhelmed the world coalition.&quot; The same scenario repeated itself several times.) until Qin decisively moved from hegemony to conquests and annexations in 221 BC.

=== 2nd century BC – 15th century AD ===

Rome established its hegemony over the entire Mediterranean after its victory over the Seleucid Empire in 189 BC. Officially, Rome&#x27;s client states were outside the whole Roman imperium, and preserved their entire sovereignty and international rights and privileges.

With few exceptions, the Roman treaties with client states (&quot;foedera&quot;) were formulized on equal terms without any expression of clientship and the Romans almost never used the word &quot;client.&quot; The term &quot;client king&quot; is an invention of the post-Renaissance scholarship. Those who are conventionally called by modern historians of Rome &quot;client kings&quot; were referred to as &quot;allies and friends&quot; of the Roman people. &quot;Alliance&quot; and &quot;friendship,&quot; not any kind of subordination, bound them to Rome.

No regular or formal tribute was extracted from client states. The land of a client state could not officially be a basis for taxation. The overall fact is that, despite extensive conquests, the Romans did not settle down nor extracted revenues in any subdued territories between 200 and 148 BC. The first good evidence for regular taxation of another kingdom comes from Judea as late as 64 BC.

The Roman hegemony of the late Republic left to the Mediterranean kings internal autonomy and obliged them not to enter alliances hostile to Rome and not to wage offensive wars without consent of the Senate. Annexations usually followed when client kings broke this order (Macedonia in 148 BC and Pontus in 64 BC). In the course of these and other annexations, Rome gradually evolved from hegemony into empire. The last major client state of the Mediterranean – the Ptolemaic Kingdom – was annexed by Augustus in the very beginning of his reign in 30 BC.

Augustus initiated an unprecedented era of peace, shortly after his reign called &quot;Pax Romana&quot;. This peace however was imperial rather than hegemonic. Classic and modern scholars who call &quot;Pax Romana&quot; &quot;hegemonic peace,&quot; use the term &quot;hegemony&quot; in its broader sense which includes both hegemony and empire.

From the 7th century to the 12th century, the Umayyad Caliphate and later Abbasid Caliphate dominated the vast territories they governed, with other states like the Byzantine Empire paying tribute.

In 7th century India, Harsha, ruler of a large empire in northern India from AD 606 to 647, brought most of the north under his hegemony. He preferred not to rule as a central government, but left &quot;conquered kings on their thrones and contenting himself with tribute and homage.&quot;

From the late 9th to the early 11th century, the empire developed by Charlemagne achieved hegemony in Europe, with dominance over France, most of Northern and Central Italy, Burgundy and Germany.

From the 11th to the late 15th centuries the Italian maritime republics, in particular Venice and Genoa held hegemony in the Mediterranean, dominating trade between Europe and the Orient for centuries, and having naval supremacy. However, with the arrival of the Age of Discovery and the Early modern period, they began to gradually lose their hegemony to other European powers.

=== 16th–19th centuries ===

In &quot;The Rise of the Qi Ye Ji Tuan and the Emergence of Chinese Hegemony&quot; Jayantha Jayman writes, &quot;If we consider the Western dominated global system from as early as the 15th century, there have been several hegemonic powers and contenders that have attempted to create the world order in their own images.&quot; He lists several contenders for historical hegemony:
* Portugal 1494 to 1580 (From the end of the Italian Wars to Spanish-Portuguese Union). Based on Portugal&#x27;s dominance in navigation.
*Spain 1516 to 1659 (From the accession of Charles I of Spain to the Treaty of the Pyrenees). Based on the Spanish dominance of the European battlefields and the global exploration and colonization of the New World.
* The Netherlands 1580 to 1688 (From the 1579 Treaty of Utrecht, which marks the foundation of the Dutch Republic, to the Glorious Revolution, William of Orange&#x27;s arrival in England). Based on Dutch control of credit and money.
* France 1643 to 1763 (From the accession of Louis XIV to the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War).
* Britain 1688 to 1792 (From the Glorious Revolution to the start of the French Revolutionary Wars). Based on British textiles and command of the high seas.
* French Revolution and Napoleonic France (1789 to 1815).
* Britain 1815 to 1914 (From the Congress of Vienna to the start of the Great War). Based on British industrial supremacy and railroads.

Phillip IV tried to restore the Habsburg dominance but, by the middle of the 17th century &quot;Spain&#x27;s pretensions to hegemony (in Europe) had definitely and irremediably failed.&quot;
In late 16th- and 17th-century Holland, the Dutch Republic&#x27;s mercantilist dominion was an early instance of commercial hegemony, made feasible by the development of wind power for the efficient production and delivery of goods and services. This, in turn, made possible the Amsterdam stock market and concomitant dominance of world trade.

In France, King Louis XIV (1638–1715) and (Emperor) Napoleon I (1799–1815) attempted true French hegemony via economic, cultural and military domination of most of Continental Europe. However, Jeremy Black writes that, because of Britain, France &quot;was unable to enjoy the benefits&quot; of this hegemony.

After the defeat and exile of Napoleon, hegemony largely passed to the British Empire, which became the largest empire in history, with Queen Victoria (1837–1901) ruling over one-quarter of the world&#x27;s land and population at its zenith. Like the Dutch, the British Empire was primarily seaborne; many British possessions were located around the rim of the Indian Ocean, as well as numerous islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Britain also controlled the Indian subcontinent and large portions of Africa.

In Europe, Germany, rather than Britain, may have been the strongest power after 1871, but Samuel Newland writes:Bismarck defined the road ahead as … no expansion, no push for hegemony in Europe. Germany was to be the strongest power in Europe but without being a hegemon. … His basic axioms were first, no conflict among major powers in Central Europe; and second, German security without German hegemony.&quot;

These fluctuations form the basis for cyclical theories by George Modelski and Joshua S. Goldstein, both of whom allege that naval power is vital for hegemony.

=== 20th century ===

The early 20th century, like the late 19th century, was characterized by multiple Great Powers but no global hegemon. World War I strengthened the United States and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Both of these states&#x27; governments pursued policies to expand their regional spheres of influence, the US in Latin America and Japan in East Asia. France, the UK, Italy, the Soviet Union and later Nazi Germany (1933–1945) all either maintained imperialist policies based on spheres of influence or attempted to conquer territory but none achieved the status of a global hegemonic power.

After the Second World War, the United Nations was established and the five strongest global powers (China, France, the UK, the US, and the USSR) were given permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, the organization&#x27;s most powerful decision-making body.

Following the war, the US and the USSR were the two strongest global powers and this created a bi-polar power dynamic in international affairs, commonly referred to as the Cold War. American hegemony during this time has been described as &quot;Empire by invitation&quot;. The hegemonic conflict was ideological, between communism and capitalism, as well as geopolitical, between the Warsaw Pact countries (1955–1991) and NATO/SEATO/CENTO countries (1949–present/1954–1977/1955–1979). During the Cold War both hegemons competed against each other directly (during the arms race) and indirectly (via proxy wars). The result was that many countries, no matter how remote, were drawn into the conflict when it was suspected that their government&#x27;s policies might destabilize the balance of power. Reinhard Hildebrandt calls this a period of &quot;dual-hegemony&quot;, where &quot;two dominant states have been stabilizing their European spheres of influence &quot;against and alongside each other&quot;.&quot; 
Proxy wars became battle grounds between forces supported either directly or indirectly by the hegemonic powers and included the Korean War, the Laotian Civil War, the Arab–Israeli conflict, the Vietnam War, the Afghan War, the Angolan Civil War, and the Central American Civil Wars.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States was the world&#x27;s sole hegemonic power.

=== 21st century ===

Various perspectives on whether the US was or continues to be a hegemon have been presented since the end of the Cold War. Most notably, American political scientists John Mearsheimer and Joseph Nye have argued that the US is not a genuine global hegemon because it has neither the financial nor the military resources to impose a proper, formal, global hegemony. This theory is heavily contested in academic discussions of international relations, with Anna Beyer being a notable critic of Nye and Mearsheimer. According to Mearsheimer, global hegemony is unlikely due to the difficulties in projecting power over large bodies of water. A Historian analyzed the claim:

The French Socialist politician Hubert Védrine in 1999 described the US as a hegemonic hyperpower, because of its unilateral military actions worldwide.

Pentagon strategist Edward Luttwak, in &quot;The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire&quot;, outlined three stages, with hegemonic being the first, followed by imperial. In his view the transformation proved to be fatal and eventually led to the fall of the Roman Empire. His book gives implicit advice to Washington to continue the present hegemonic strategy and refrain from establishing an empire.

In 2006, author Zhu Zhiqun claimed that China is already on the way to becoming the world hegemon and that the focus should be on how a peaceful transfer of power can be achieved between the US and China, but has faced opposition to this claim. According to the recent study published in 2019, the authors argued that a &quot;third‐way hegemony&quot; or Dutch‐style hegemony apart from a peaceful or violent hegemonic rise may be the most feasible option to describe China in its global hegemony in the future.

== Political science ==


In the historical writing of the 19th century, the denotation of &quot;hegemony&quot; extended to describe the predominance of one country upon other countries; and, by extension, &quot;hegemonism&quot; denoted the Great Power politics (c. 1880s – 1914) for establishing hegemony (indirect imperial rule), that then leads to a definition of imperialism (direct foreign rule).

In the early 20th century, the Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci used the idea of hegemony to talk about politics &quot;within&quot; a given society. He developed the theory of cultural hegemony, an analysis of economic class (including social class) and how the ruling class uses consent as well as force to maintain its power. Hence, the philosophic and sociologic theory of cultural hegemony analysed the social norms that established the social structures to impose their &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; (world view)—justifying the social, political, and economic &quot;status quo&quot;—as natural, inevitable, and beneficial to every social class, rather than as artificial social constructs beneficial solely to the ruling class.

From the Gramsci analysis derived the political science denotation of hegemony as &quot;leadership&quot;; thus, the historical example of Prussia as the militarily and culturally predominant province of the German Empire (1871–1918); and the personal and intellectual predominance of Napoleon Bonaparte upon the French Consulate (1799–1804). Contemporarily, in &quot;Hegemony and Socialist Strategy&quot; (1985), Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe defined hegemony as a political relationship of power wherein a sub-ordinate society (collectivity) perform social tasks that are culturally unnatural and not beneficial to them, but that are in exclusive benefit to the imperial interests of the hegemon, the superior, ordinate power; hegemony is a military, political, and economic relationship that occurs as an articulation within political discourse. Beyer analysed the contemporary hegemony of the United States at the example of the Global War on Terrorism and presented the mechanisms and processes of American exercise of power in &#x27;hegemonic governance&#x27;.

== International relations ==
In the field of International Relations, hegemony generally refers to the ability of an actor to shape the international system. Usually this actor is a state, such as Britain in the 19th century or the United States in the 20th century. A hegemon may shape the international system through coercive and non-coercive means. According to Nuno Monteiro, hegemony is distinct from unipolarity. The latter refers to a preponderance of power within an anarchic system, whereas the former refers to a hierarchical system where the most powerful state has the ability to &quot;control the external behavior of all other states.&quot;

The English school of international relations takes a broader view of history. The research of Adam Watson was world-historical in scope. For him, hegemony was the most common order in history (historical &quot;optimum&quot;) because many provinces of &quot;frank&quot; empires were under hegemonic rather than imperial rule. Watson summarized his life-long research: There was a spectrum of political systems ranging between multiple independent states and universal empire. The further a political system evolved towards one of the extremes, the greater was the gravitational pull towards the hegemonic center of the spectrum.

Hegemony may take different forms. Benevolent hegemons provide public goods to the countries within their sphere of influence. Coercive hegemons exert their economic or military power to discipline unruly or free-riding countries in their sphere of influence. Exploitative hegemonies extract resources from other countries. 
A prominent theory in International Relations focusing on the role of hegemonies is hegemonic stability theory. Its premise is that a hegemonic power is necessary to develop and uphold a stable international political and economic order. The theory was developed in the 1970s by Robert Gilpin and Stephen D. Krasner, among others. It has been criticized on both conceptual and empirical grounds. For example, Robert Keohane has argued that the theory is not a proper theory because it amounts to a series of allegedly redundant claims that apparently could not be used predictively.

A number of International Relations scholars have examined the decline of hegemons and their orders. For some, such decline tends to be disruptive because the stability that the hegemon provided gives way to a power vacuum. Others have maintained that cooperation may persist in the face of hegemonic decline because of institutions or enhanced contributions from non-hegemonic powers.

There has been a long debate in the field about whether American hegemony is in decline. As early as in the 1970s, Robert Gilpin suggested that the global order maintained by the United States would eventually decline as benefits from the public goods provided by Washington would diffuse to other states. In the 1980s, some scholars singled out Japan&#x27;s economic growth and technological sophistication as a threat to U.S. primacy. More recently, analysts have focused on the economic and military rise of China and its challenge to U.S. hegemony.

Scholars differ as to whether bipolarity or unipolarity is likely to produce the most stable and peaceful outcomes. Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer are among those who argue that bipolarity tends to generate relatively more stability, whereas John Ikenberry and William Wohlforth are among those arguing for the stabilizing impact of unipolarity. Some scholars, such as Karl Deutsch and J. David Singer argued that multipolarity was the most stable structure.

Scholars disagree about the sources and stability of U.S. unipolarity. Realist international relations scholars argue that unipolarity is rooted in the superiority of U.S. material power since the end of the Cold War. Liberal international relations scholar John Ikenberry attributes U.S. hegemony in part to what he says are commitments and self-restraint that the United States established through the creation of international institutions (such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization). Constructivist scholar Martha Finnemore argues that legitimation and institutionalization are key components of unipolarity.

== Sociology ==
Academics have argued that in the praxis of hegemony, imperial dominance is established by means of cultural imperialism, whereby the leader state (hegemon) dictates the internal politics and the societal character of the subordinate states that constitute the hegemonic sphere of influence, either by an internal, sponsored government or by an external, installed government. The imposition of the hegemon&#x27;s way of life—an imperial &quot;lingua franca&quot; and bureaucracies (social, economic, educational, governing)—transforms the concrete imperialism of direct military domination into the abstract power of the &quot;status quo&quot;, indirect imperial domination. J. Brutt-Griffler, a critic of this view, has described it as &quot;deeply condescending&quot; and &quot;treats people ... as blank slates on which global capitalism&#x27;s moving finger writes its message, leaving behind another cultural automaton as it moves on.&quot;

Culturally, hegemony also is established by means of language, specifically the imposed &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the hegemon (leader state), which then is the official source of information for the people of the society of the sub-ordinate state. Writing on language and power, Andrea Mayr says, &quot;As a practice of power, hegemony operates largely through language.&quot; In contemporary society, an example of the use of language in this way is in the way Western countries set up educational systems in African countries mediated by Western languages.

Suggested examples of cultural imperialism include the latter-stage Spanish, French colonial empires and British Empires, the 19th- and 20th-century Reichs of unified Germany (1871–1945), and by the end of the 20th century, the United States.

== Media studies ==
Adopted from the work of Gramsci and Stuart Hall, hegemony with respect to media studies refers to individuals or concepts that become most dominant in a culture. Building on Gramsci&#x27;s ideas, Hall stated that the media is a critical institution for furthering or inhibiting hegemony.

<text>In number theory, Euler&#x27;s totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer that are relatively prime to . It is written using the Greek letter phi as formula_1 or formula_2, and may also be called Euler&#x27;s phi function. In other words, it is the number of integers in the range for which the greatest common divisor is equal to 1. The integers of this form are sometimes referred to as totatives of .

For example, the totatives of are the six numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8. They are all relatively prime to 9, but the other three numbers in this range, 3, 6, and 9 are not, since and . Therefore, . As another example, since for the only integer in the range from 1 to is 1 itself, and .

Euler&#x27;s totient function is a multiplicative function, meaning that if two numbers and are relatively prime, then .
This function gives the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo (the group of units of the ring formula_3). It is also used for defining the RSA encryption system.

== History, terminology, and notation ==

Leonhard Euler introduced the function in 1763. However, he did not at that time choose any specific symbol to denote it. In a 1784 publication, Euler studied the function further, choosing the Greek letter to denote it: he wrote for &quot;the multitude of numbers less than , and which have no common divisor with it&quot;. This definition varies from the current definition for the totient function at but is otherwise the same. The now-standard notation comes from Gauss&#x27;s 1801 treatise &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;, although Gauss did not use parentheses around the argument and wrote . Thus, it is often called Euler&#x27;s phi function or simply the phi function.

In 1879, J. J. Sylvester coined the term totient for this function, so it is also referred to as Euler&#x27;s totient function, the Euler totient, or Euler&#x27;s totient. Jordan&#x27;s totient is a generalization of Euler&#x27;s.

The cototient of is defined as . It counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to that have at least one prime factor in common with .

== Computing Euler&#x27;s totient function ==

There are several formulae for computing .

===Euler&#x27;s product formula===

It states
:formula_4
where the product is over the distinct prime numbers dividing . (For notation, see Arithmetical function.)

An equivalent formulation is
formula_5 where formula_6 is the prime factorization of formula_7 (that is, formula_8 are distinct prime numbers).

The proof of these formulae depends on two important facts.

==== Phi is a multiplicative function ====

This means that if , then . &quot;Proof outline:&quot; Let , , be the sets of positive integers which are coprime to and less than , , , respectively, so that , etc. Then there is a bijection between and by the Chinese remainder theorem.

==== Value of phi for a prime power argument ====

If is prime and , then

:formula_9

&quot;Proof&quot;: Since is a prime number, the only possible values of are , and the only way to have is if is a multiple of , that is, , and there are such multiples not greater than . Therefore, the other numbers are all relatively prime to .

====Proof of Euler&#x27;s product formula====

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that if there is a unique expression formula_10 where are prime numbers and each . (The case corresponds to the empty product.) Repeatedly using the multiplicative property of and the formula for gives

:formula_11

This gives both versions of Euler&#x27;s product formula.

An alternative proof that does not require the multiplicative property instead uses the inclusion-exclusion principle applied to the set formula_12, excluding the sets of integers divisible by the prime divisors.

====Example====

:formula_13

In words: the distinct prime factors of 20 are 2 and 5; half of the twenty integers from 1 to 20 are divisible by 2, leaving ten; a fifth of those are divisible by 5, leaving eight numbers coprime to 20; these are: 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19.

The alternative formula uses only integers:formula_14

===Fourier transform===

The totient is the discrete Fourier transform of the gcd, evaluated at 1. Let

:formula_15

where for . Then

:formula_16

The real part of this formula is

:formula_17

For example, using formula_18 and formula_19:formula_20Unlike the Euler product and the divisor sum formula, this one does not require knowing the factors of . However, it does involve the calculation of the greatest common divisor of and every positive integer less than , which suffices to provide the factorization anyway.

===Divisor sum===

The property established by Gauss, that

:formula_21

where the sum is over all positive divisors of , can be proven in several ways. (See Arithmetical function for notational conventions.)

One proof is to note that is also equal to the number of possible generators of the cyclic group ; specifically, if with , then is a generator for every coprime to . Since every element of generates a cyclic subgroup, and each subgroup is generated by precisely elements of , the formula follows. Equivalently, the formula can be derived by the same argument applied to the multiplicative group of the th roots of unity and the primitive th roots of unity.

The formula can also be derived from elementary arithmetic. For example, let and consider the positive fractions up to 1 with denominator 20:
:formula_22

Put them into lowest terms:
:formula_23

These twenty fractions are all the positive ≤ 1 whose denominators are the divisors . The fractions with 20 as denominator are those with numerators relatively prime to 20, namely , , , , , , , ; by definition this is fractions. Similarly, there are fractions with denominator 10, and fractions with denominator 5, etc. Thus the set of twenty fractions is split into subsets of size for each dividing 20. A similar argument applies for any &quot;n.&quot;

Möbius inversion applied to the divisor sum formula gives
:formula_24

where is the Möbius function, the multiplicative function defined by formula_25 and formula_26 for each prime and . This formula may also be derived from the product formula by multiplying out formula_27 to get formula_28

An example:formula_29

==Some values==

The first 100 values are shown in the table and graph below:
:

In the graph at right the top line is an upper bound valid for all other than one, and attained if and only if is a prime number. A simple lower bound is formula_30, which is rather loose: in fact, the lower limit of the graph is proportional to .
==Euler&#x27;s theorem==

This states that if and are relatively prime then

:formula_31

The special case where is prime is known as Fermat&#x27;s little theorem.

This follows from Lagrange&#x27;s theorem and the fact that is the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo.

The RSA cryptosystem is based on this theorem: it implies that the inverse of the function , where is the (public) encryption exponent, is the function , where , the (private) decryption exponent, is the multiplicative inverse of modulo . The difficulty of computing without knowing the factorization of is thus the difficulty of computing : this is known as the RSA problem which can be solved by factoring . The owner of the private key knows the factorization, since an RSA private key is constructed by choosing as the product of two (randomly chosen) large primes and . Only is publicly disclosed, and given the difficulty to factor large numbers we have the guarantee that no one else knows the factorization.

==Other formulae==
===Menon&#x27;s identity===
In 1965 P. Kesava Menon proved
:formula_32
where is the number of divisors of .

===Divisibility by any fixed positive integer===

The following property, which is part of the « folklore » (i.e., apparently unpublished as a specific result: see the introduction of this article in which it is stated as having « long been known ») has important consequences. For instance it rules out uniform distribution of the values of formula_1 in the arithmetic progressions modulo formula_34 for any integer formula_35. 

* For every fixed positive integer formula_34, the relation formula_37 holds for almost all formula_7, meaning for all but formula_39 values of formula_40 as formula_41.

This is an elementary consequence of the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes congruent to 1 modulo formula_34 diverges, which itself is a corollary of the proof of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions.

==Generating functions==

The Dirichlet series for may be written in terms of the Riemann zeta function as:
:formula_43
where the left-hand side converges for formula_44.

The Lambert series generating function is

:formula_45

which converges for .

Both of these are proved by elementary series manipulations and the formulae for .

==Growth rate==

In the words of Hardy &amp; Wright, the order of is &quot;always &#x27;nearly &#x27;.&quot;

First

:formula_46

but as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity, for all 

:formula_47

These two formulae can be proved by using little more than the formulae for and the divisor sum function .

In fact, during the proof of the second formula, the inequality

:formula_48

true for , is proved.

We also have

:formula_49

Here is Euler&#x27;s constant, , so and .

Proving this does not quite require the prime number theorem. Since goes to infinity, this formula shows that

:formula_50

In fact, more is true.

:formula_51

and

:formula_52

The second inequality was shown by Jean-Louis Nicolas. Ribenboim says &quot;The method of proof is interesting, in that the inequality is shown first under the assumption that the Riemann hypothesis is true, secondly under the contrary assumption.&quot;

For the average order, we have

:formula_53
due to Arnold Walfisz, its proof exploiting estimates on exponential sums due to I. M. Vinogradov and N. M. Korobov. 
By a combination of van der Corput&#x27;s and Vinogradov&#x27;s methods, H.-Q. Liu (On Euler&#x27;s function.Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A 146 (2016), no. 4, 769–775) 
improved the error term to 
:formula_54
(this is currently the best known estimate of this type). The &quot;Big &quot; stands for a quantity that is bounded by a constant times the function of inside the parentheses (which is small compared to ).

This result can be used to prove that the probability of two randomly chosen numbers being relatively prime is .

==Ratio of consecutive values==

In 1950 Somayajulu proved

:formula_55

In 1954 Schinzel and Sierpiński strengthened this, proving that the set

:formula_56

is dense in the positive real numbers. They also proved that the set

:formula_57

is dense in the interval (0,1).

==Totient numbers==
A totient number is a value of Euler&#x27;s totient function: that is, an for which there is at least one for which . The &quot;valency&quot; or &quot;multiplicity&quot; of a totient number is the number of solutions to this equation. A &quot;nontotient&quot; is a natural number which is not a totient number. Every odd integer exceeding 1 is trivially a nontotient. There are also infinitely many even nontotients, and indeed every positive integer has a multiple which is an even nontotient.

The number of totient numbers up to a given limit is

:formula_58

for a constant .

If counted accordingly to multiplicity, the number of totient numbers up to a given limit is

:formula_59

where the error term is of order at most for any positive .

It is known that the multiplicity of exceeds infinitely often for any .

===Ford&#x27;s theorem===

 proved that for every integer there is a totient number of multiplicity : that is, for which the equation has exactly solutions; this result had previously been conjectured by Wacław Sierpiński, and it had been obtained as a consequence of Schinzel&#x27;s hypothesis H. Indeed, each multiplicity that occurs, does so infinitely often.

However, no number is known with multiplicity . Carmichael&#x27;s totient function conjecture is the statement that there is no such .

===Perfect totient numbers===
A perfect totient number is an integer that is equal to the sum of its iterated totients. That is, we apply the totient function to a number &quot;n&quot;, apply it again to the resulting totient, and so on, until the number 1 is reached, and add together the resulting sequence of numbers; if the sum equals &quot;n&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; is a perfect totient number.

==Applications==

===Cyclotomy===

In the last section of the &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; Gauss proves that a regular -gon can be constructed with straightedge and compass if is a power of 2. If is a power of an odd prime number the formula for the totient says its totient can be a power of two only if is a first power and is a power of 2. The primes that are one more than a power of 2 are called Fermat primes, and only five are known: 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537. Fermat and Gauss knew of these. Nobody has been able to prove whether there are any more.

Thus, a regular -gon has a straightedge-and-compass construction if &quot;n&quot; is a product of distinct Fermat primes and any power of 2. The first few such are
:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 30, 32, 34, 40... .

===Prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions===

===The RSA cryptosystem===

Setting up an RSA system involves choosing large prime numbers and , computing and , and finding two numbers and such that . The numbers and (the &quot;encryption key&quot;) are released to the public, and (the &quot;decryption key&quot;) is kept private.

A message, represented by an integer , where , is encrypted by computing .

It is decrypted by computing . Euler&#x27;s Theorem can be used to show that if , then .

The security of an RSA system would be compromised if the number could be efficiently factored or if could be efficiently computed without factoring .

==Unsolved problems==

===Lehmer&#x27;s conjecture===

If is prime, then . In 1932 D. H. Lehmer asked if there are any composite numbers such that divides . None are known.

In 1933 he proved that if any such exists, it must be odd, square-free, and divisible by at least seven primes (i.e. ). In 1980 Cohen and Hagis proved that and that . Further, Hagis showed that if 3 divides then and .

===Carmichael&#x27;s conjecture===

This states that there is no number with the property that for all other numbers , , . See Ford&#x27;s theorem above.

As stated in the main article, if there is a single counterexample to this conjecture, there must be infinitely many counterexamples, and the smallest one has at least ten billion digits in base 10.

===Riemann hypothesis===

The Riemann hypothesis is true if and only if the inequality
:formula_60
is true for all where is Euler&#x27;s constant and is the product of the first primes.

<text>In number theory, Fermat&#x27;s little theorem states that if is a prime number, then for any integer , the number is an integer multiple of . In the notation of modular arithmetic, this is expressed as
formula_1

For example, if and , then , and is an integer multiple of .

If is not divisible by , that is, if is coprime to , then Fermat&#x27;s little theorem is equivalent to the statement that is an integer multiple of , or in symbols:
formula_2

For example, if and , then , and is a multiple of .

Fermat&#x27;s little theorem is the basis for the Fermat primality test and is one of the fundamental results of elementary number theory. The theorem is named after Pierre de Fermat, who stated it in 1640. It is called the &quot;little theorem&quot; to distinguish it from Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

== History ==

Pierre de Fermat first stated the theorem in a letter dated October 18, 1640, to his friend and confidant Frénicle de Bessy. His formulation is equivalent to the following:

If is a prime and is any integer not divisible by , then is divisible by .
Fermat&#x27;s original statement was 
This may be translated, with explanations and formulas added in brackets for easier understanding, as:

Every prime number [] divides necessarily one of the powers minus one of any [geometric] progression [] [that is, there exists such that divides ], and the exponent of this power [] divides the given prime minus one [divides ]. After one has found the first power [] that satisfies the question, all those whose exponents are multiples of the exponent of the first one satisfy similarly the question [that is, all multiples of the first have the same property].
Fermat did not consider the case where is a multiple of nor prove his assertion, only stating:

(And this proposition is generally true for all series [&quot;sic&quot;] and for all prime numbers; I would send you a demonstration of it, if I did not fear going on for too long.)

Euler provided the first published proof in 1736, in a paper titled &quot;Theorematum Quorundam ad Numeros Primos Spectantium Demonstratio&quot; (in English: &quot;Demonstration of Certain Theorems Concerning Prime Numbers&quot;) in the &quot;Proceedings&quot; of the St. Petersburg Academy, but Leibniz had given virtually the same proof in an unpublished manuscript from sometime before 1683.

The term &quot;Fermat&#x27;s little theorem&quot; was probably first used in print in 1913 in &quot;Zahlentheorie&quot; by Kurt Hensel:

(There is a fundamental theorem holding in every finite group, usually called Fermat&#x27;s little theorem because Fermat was the first to have proved a very special part of it.)

An early use in English occurs in A.A. Albert&#x27;s &quot;Modern Higher Algebra&quot; (1937), which refers to &quot;the so-called &#x27;little&#x27; Fermat theorem&quot; on page 206.

=== Further history ===

Some mathematicians independently made the related hypothesis (sometimes incorrectly called the Chinese hypothesis) that if and only if is prime. Indeed, the &quot;if&quot; part is true, and it is a special case of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. However, the &quot;only if&quot; part is false: For example, , but 341 = 11 × 31 is a pseudoprime to base 2. See below.

== Proofs ==

Several proofs of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem are known. It is frequently proved as a corollary of Euler&#x27;s theorem.

== Generalizations ==
Euler&#x27;s theorem is a generalization of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem: For any modulus and any integer coprime to , one has

formula_3

where denotes Euler&#x27;s totient function (which counts the integers from 1 to that are coprime to ). Fermat&#x27;s little theorem is indeed a special case, because if is a prime number, then .

A corollary of Euler&#x27;s theorem is: For every positive integer , if the integer is coprime with , then
formula_4
for any integers and .
This follows from Euler&#x27;s theorem, since, if formula_5, then for some integer , and one has
formula_6

If is prime, this is also a corollary of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. This is widely used in modular arithmetic, because this allows reducing modular exponentiation with large exponents to exponents smaller than .

Euler&#x27;s theorem is used with not prime in public-key cryptography, specifically in the RSA cryptosystem, typically in the following way: if
formula_7
retrieving from the values of , and is easy if one knows . In fact, the extended Euclidean algorithm allows computing the modular inverse of modulo , that is, the integer such that
formula_8
It follows that
formula_9

On the other hand, if is the product of two distinct prime numbers, then . In this case, finding from and is as difficult as computing (this has not been proven, but no algorithm is known for computing without knowing ). Knowing only , the computation of has essentially the same difficulty as the factorization of , since , and conversely, the factors and are the (integer) solutions of the equation .

The basic idea of RSA cryptosystem is thus: If a message is encrypted as , using public values of and , then, with the current knowledge, it cannot be decrypted without finding the (secret) factors and of .

Fermat&#x27;s little theorem is also related to the Carmichael function and Carmichael&#x27;s theorem, as well as to Lagrange&#x27;s theorem in group theory.

== Converse ==
The converse of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem fails for Carmichael numbers. However, a slightly weaker variant of the converse is Lehmer&#x27;s theorem:

If there exists an integer such that
formula_10
and for all primes dividing one has
formula_11
then is prime.

This theorem forms the basis for the Lucas primality test, an important primality test, and Pratt&#x27;s primality certificate.
== Pseudoprimes ==

If and are coprime numbers such that is divisible by , then need not be prime. If it is not, then is called a &quot;(Fermat) pseudoprime&quot; to base . The first pseudoprime to base 2 was found in 1820 by Pierre Frédéric Sarrus: 341 = 11 × 31.

A number that is a Fermat pseudoprime to base for every number coprime to is called a Carmichael number. Alternately, any number satisfying the equality
formula_12
is either a prime or a Carmichael number.

== Miller–Rabin primality test ==
The Miller–Rabin primality test uses the following extension of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem: 
If is an odd prime and with and odd &gt; 0, then for every coprime to , either or there exists such that and .

This result may be deduced from Fermat&#x27;s little theorem by the fact that, if is an odd prime, then the integers modulo form a finite field, in which 1 modulo has exactly two square roots, 1 and −1 modulo .

Note that holds trivially for , because the congruence relation is compatible with exponentiation. And holds trivially for since is odd, for the same reason. That is why one usually chooses a random in the interval .

The Miller–Rabin test uses this property in the following way: given an odd integer for which primality has to be tested, write with and odd &gt; 0, and choose a random such that ; then compute ; if is not 1 nor −1, then square it repeatedly modulo until you get −1 or have squared times. If and −1 has not been obtained by squaring, then is a &quot;composite&quot; and is a witness for the compositeness of . Otherwise, is a &quot;strong probable prime to base a&quot;; that is, it may be prime or not. If is composite, the probability that the test declares it a strong probable prime anyway is at most , in which case is a &quot;strong pseudoprime&quot;, and is a &quot;strong liar&quot;. Therefore after non-conclusive random tests, the probability that is composite is at most 4−&quot;k&quot;, and may thus be made as low as desired by increasing .

In summary, the test either proves that a number is composite or asserts that it is prime with a probability of error that may be chosen as low as desired. The test is very simple to implement and computationally more efficient than all known deterministic tests. Therefore, it is generally used before starting a proof of primality.

<doc id="53455" wikidata="Q1097021" url="?curid=53455" title="Minkowski's theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Minkowski&#x27;s theorem is the statement that every convex set in formula_1 which is symmetric with respect to the origin and which has volume greater than formula_2 contains a non-zero integer point (meaning a point in formula_3 that is not the origin). The theorem was proved by Hermann Minkowski in 1889 and became the foundation of the branch of number theory called the geometry of numbers. It can be extended from the integers to any lattice formula_4 and to any symmetric convex set with volume greater than formula_5, where formula_6 denotes the covolume of the lattice (the absolute value of the determinant of any of its bases).

==Formulation==
Suppose that is a lattice of determinant in the -dimensional real vector space formula_1 and is a convex subset of formula_1 that is symmetric with respect to the origin, meaning that if is in then is also in . Minkowski&#x27;s theorem states that if the volume of is strictly greater than , then must contain at least one lattice point other than the origin. (Since the set is symmetric, it would then contain at least three lattice points: the origin 0 and a pair of points , where .)

==Example==
The simplest example of a lattice is the integer lattice formula_9 of all points with integer coefficients; its determinant is 1. For , the theorem claims that a convex figure in the Euclidean plane symmetric about the origin and with area greater than 4 encloses at least one lattice point in addition to the origin. The area bound is sharp: if is the interior of the square with vertices then is symmetric and convex, and has area 4, but the only lattice point it contains is the origin. This example, showing that the bound of the theorem is sharp, generalizes to hypercubes in every dimension .

==Proof==
The following argument proves Minkowski&#x27;s theorem for the specific case of formula_10

Proof of the formula_11 case: Consider the map
:formula_12
Intuitively, this map cuts the plane into 2 by 2 squares, then stacks the squares on top of each other. Clearly has area less than or equal to 4, because this set lies within a 2 by 2 square. Assume for a contradiction that could be injective, which means the pieces of cut out by the squares stack up in a non-overlapping way. Because is locally area-preserving, this non-overlapping property would make it area-preserving for all of , so the area of would be the same as that of , which is greater than 4. That is not the case, so the assumption must be false: is not injective, meaning that there exist at least two distinct points in that are mapped by to the same point: .

Because of the way was defined, the only way that can equal is for 
to equal for some integers and , not both zero.
That is, the coordinates of the two points differ by two even integers. 
Since is symmetric about the origin, is also a point in . Since is convex, the line segment between and lies entirely in , and in particular the midpoint of that segment lies in . In other words,
:formula_13
is a point in . This point is an integer point, and is not the origin since and are not both zero.
Therefore, contains a nonzero integer point.

Remarks: 
* The argument above proves the theorem that any set of volume formula_14 contains two distinct points that differ by a lattice vector. This is a special case of Blichfeldt&#x27;s theorem.
* The argument above highlights that the term formula_15 is the covolume of the lattice formula_16.
* To obtain a proof for general lattices, it suffices to prove Minkowski&#x27;s theorem only for formula_17; this is because every full-rank lattice can be written as formula_18 for some linear transformation formula_19, and the properties of being convex and symmetric about the origin are preserved by linear transformations, while the covolume of formula_18 is formula_21 and volume of a body scales by exactly formula_22 under an application of formula_23.

==Applications==

===Bounding the shortest vector===
Minkowski&#x27;s theorem gives an upper bound for the length of the shortest nonzero vector. This result has applications in lattice cryptography and number theory.

Theorem (Minkowski&#x27;s bound on the shortest vector): Let formula_24 be a lattice. Then there is a formula_25 with formula_26. In particular, by the standard comparison between formula_27 and formula_28 norms, formula_29.

Remarks:

* The constant in the formula_30 bound can be improved, for instance by taking the open ball of radius formula_31 as formula_32 in the above argument. The optimal constant is known as the Hermite constant.
* The bound given by the theorem can be very loose, as can be seen by considering the lattice generated by formula_33. But it cannot be further improved in the sense that there exists a global constant formula_34 such that there exists an formula_35-dimensional lattice formula_4 satisfying formula_37for all formula_38. Furthermore, such lattice can be self-dual. 
* Even though Minkowski&#x27;s theorem guarantees a short lattice vector within a certain magnitude bound, finding this vector is in general a hard computational problem. Finding the vector within a factor guaranteed by Minkowski&#x27;s bound is referred to as Minkowski&#x27;s Vector Problem (MVP), and it is known that approximation SVP reduces to it using transference properties of the dual lattice. The computational problem is also sometimes referred to as HermiteSVP.
* The LLL-basis reduction algorithm can be seen as a weak but efficiently algorithmic version of Minkowski&#x27;s bound on the shortest vector. This is because a formula_39-LLL reduced basis formula_40 for formula_41 has the property that formula_42; see these lecture notes of Micciancio for more on this. As explained in, proofs of bounds on the Hermite constant contain some of the key ideas in the LLL-reduction algorithm.

===Applications to number theory===
====Primes that are sums of two squares====
The difficult implication in Fermat&#x27;s theorem on sums of two squares can be proven using Minkowski&#x27;s bound on the shortest vector.

Theorem: Every prime with formula_43 can be written as a sum of two squares.

 = 1~(\text{mod}~p)&lt;/math&gt; (Euler&#x27;s Criterion) there is a square root of formula_44 in formula_45; choose one and call one representative in formula_46 for it formula_47. Consider the lattice formula_24 defined by the vectors formula_49, and let formula_50 denote the associated matrix. The determinant of this lattice is formula_51, whence Minkowski&#x27;s bound tells us that there is a nonzero formula_52 with formula_53. We have formula_54 and we define the integers formula_55. Minkowski&#x27;s bound tells us that formula_56, and simple modular arithmetic shows that formula_57, and thus we conclude that formula_58. Q.E.D.}}

Additionally, the lattice perspective gives a computationally efficient approach to Fermat&#x27;s theorem on sums of squares:
 First, recall that finding any nonzero vector with norm less than formula_59 in formula_24, the lattice of the proof, gives a decomposition of formula_51 as a sum of two squares. Such vectors can be found efficiently, for instance using LLL-algorithm. In particular, if formula_62 is a formula_63-LLL reduced basis, then, by the property that formula_64, formula_65. Thus, by running the LLL-lattice basis reduction algorithm with formula_66, we obtain a decomposition of formula_51 as a sum of squares. Note that because every vector in formula_24 has norm squared a multiple of formula_51, the vector returned by the LLL-algorithm in this case is in fact a shortest vector.
====Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem====
Minkowski&#x27;s theorem is also useful to prove Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem, which states that every natural number can be written as the sum of the squares of four natural numbers.

====Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on simultaneous rational approximation====

Minkowski&#x27;s theorem can be used to prove Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on simultaneous rational approximation.

====Algebraic number theory====
Another application of Minkowski&#x27;s theorem is the result that every class in the ideal class group of a number field contains an integral ideal of norm not exceeding a certain bound, depending on , called Minkowski&#x27;s bound: the finiteness of the class number of an algebraic number field follows immediately.

==Complexity theory==

The complexity of finding the point guaranteed by Minkowski&#x27;s theorem, or the closely related Blichfeldt&#x27;s theorem, have been studied from the perspective of TFNP search problems. In particular, it is known that a computational analogue of Blichfeldt&#x27;s theorem, a corollary of the proof of Minkowski&#x27;s theorem, is PPP-complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2018/778 2018&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that the computational analogue of Minkowski&#x27;s theorem is in the class PPP, and it was conjectured to be PPP complete.

<text>Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa; , from Quechua &#x27; or&#x27;) is a flowering plant in the amaranth family. It is a herbaceous annual plant grown as a crop primarily for its edible seeds; the seeds are high in protein, dietary fiber, B vitamins and dietary minerals especially potassium and magnesium in amounts greater than in many grains. Quinoa is not a grass but rather a pseudocereal botanically related to spinach and amaranth (&quot;Amaranthus&quot; spp.), and originated in the Andean region of northwestern South America. It was first used to feed livestock 5,2007,000 years ago, and for human consumption 3,0004,000 years ago in the Lake Titicaca basin of Peru and Bolivia.

The plant thrives at high elevations and produces seeds that are rich in protein. Almost all production in the Andean region is done by small farms and associations. Its cultivation has spread to more than 70 countries, including Kenya, India, the United States, and European countries. As a result of increased consumption in North America, Europe, and Australasia, quinoa crop prices tripled between 2006 and 2014, entering a boom and bust cycle.

The quinoa monoculture that arose from increased production, combined with climate change effects in the native Andean region, created challenges for production and yield, and led to environmental degradation.

== Description ==
&quot;Chenopodium quinoa&quot; is a dicotyledonous annual plant, usually about high. It has broad, generally powdery, hairy, lobed leaves, normally arranged alternately. The woody central stem is branched or unbranched depending on the variety and may be green, red or purple. The flowering panicles arise from the top of the plant or from leaf axils along the stem. Each panicle has a central axis from which a secondary axis emerges either with flowers (amaranthiform) or bearing a tertiary axis carrying the flowers (glomeruliform). These are small, incomplete, sessile flowers of the same colour as the sepals, and both pistillate and perfect forms occur. Pistillate flowers are generally located at the proximal end of the glomeruli and the perfect ones at the distal end of it. A perfect flower has five sepals, five anthers and a superior ovary, from which two to three stigmatic branches emerge.

The green hypogynous flowers have a simple perianth and are generally self-fertilizing, though cross-pollination occurs. In the natural environment, betalains serve to attract animals to generate a greater rate of pollination and ensure, or improve, seed dissemination. The fruits (seeds) are about in diameter and of various colors — from white to red or black, depending on the cultivar.

In regards to the &quot;newly&quot; developed salinity resistance of &quot;C.quinoa&quot;, some studies have concluded that accumulation of organic osmolytes plays a dual role for the species. They provide osmotic adjustment, in addition to protection against oxidative stress of the photosynthetic structures in developing leaves. Studies also suggested that reduction in stomatal density in reaction to salinity levels represents an essential instrument of defence to optimize water use efficiency under the given conditions to which it may be exposed.

== Taxonomy ==
The species &quot;Chenopodium quinoa&quot; was first described by Carl Ludwig Willdenow (1765–1812), a German botanist who studied plants from South America, brought back by explorers Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland.

Quinoa is an allotetraploid plant, containing two full sets of chromosomes from two different species which hybridised with each other at one time. According to a 1979 study, its presumed ancestor is either &quot;Chenopodium berlandieri&quot;, from North America, or the Andean species &quot;Ch. hircinum&quot;, although more recent studies, in 2011, even suggest Old World relatives. On the other hand, morphological features relate &quot;Ch.quinoa&quot; of the Andes and &quot;Ch. nuttalliae&quot; of Mexico. Some studies have suggested that both species may have been derived from the same wild type. A weedy quinoa, &quot;Ch.quinoa&quot; var. &quot;melanospermum&quot;, is known from South America, but no equivalent closely related to &quot;Ch.nutalliae&quot; has been reported from Mexico so far.

Studies regarding the genetic diversity of quinoa suggest that it may have passed through at least three bottleneck genetic events, with a possible fourth expected:
*The first occurred when the species was created, as its two diploid ancestors underwent a hybridization followed by chromosome doubling, this new species was genetically isolated from its parent species, and thus lost a great deal of genetic diversity. These ancestors are still not known, but are &quot;not&quot; the higher altitude crop species &quot;Chenopodium pallidicaule&quot; (cañahua), a diploid.
*A second bottleneck may have occurred when quinoa was domesticated from its unknown but possible wild tetraploid form. It might have been domesticated twice: once in the high Andes and a second time in the Chilean and Argentinean lowlands.
*A third bottleneck can be considered &quot;political&quot;, and has lasted more than 400 years, from the Spanish conquest of the new continent until the present time. During this phase quinoa has been replaced with maize, marginalized from production processes possibly due to its important medicinal, social and religious roles for the indigenous populations of South America, but also because it is very difficult to process (dehusk) compared with maize.
*In the 21st century, a fourth bottleneck event may occur, as traditional farmers migrate from rural zones to urban centers, which exposes quinoa to the risk of further genetic erosion. Better breeding may also result in loss of genetic diversity, as breeders would be expected to reduce unwanted alleles to produce uniform cultivars, but cross-breeding between local landraces has and will likely produce high-diversity cultivars.

=== Etymology ===
The genus name &quot;Chenopodium&quot; is composed of two words coming from the Greek χήν,-νός, &quot;goose&quot; and πόδῖον, &quot;podion&quot; &quot;little foot&quot;, or &quot;goose foot&quot;, because of the resemblance of the leaves with the trace of a goose&#x27;s foot.

The specific epithet &quot;quinoa&quot; is a borrowing from the Spanish &quot;quinua&quot; or &quot;quinoa&quot;, itself derived from Quechua &quot;kinuwa&quot;.

The Incas nicknamed quinoa &quot;chisiya mama&quot;, which in Quechua means &quot;mother of all grains&quot;.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Chenopodium quinoa&quot; is believed to have been domesticated in the Peruvian Andes from wild or weed populations of the same species. There are non-cultivated quinoa plants (&quot;Chenopodium quinoa&quot; var. &quot;melanospermum&quot;) that grow in the area it is cultivated; these may either be related to wild predecessors, or they could be descendants of cultivated plants.


==Cultivation==
Over the last 5,000years the biogeography of &quot;Ch. quinoa&quot; has changed greatly, mainly by human influence, convenience and preference. It has changed not only in the area of distribution, but also in regards to the climate this plant was originally adapted to, in contrast to the climates on which it is able to successfully grow in now. In a process started by a number of pre-Inca South American indigenous cultures, people in Chile have been adapting quinoa to salinity and other forms of stress over the last 3,000years. Quinoa is also cultivated, since an early date, near the coast of northern Chile, where it was grown by the Chinchorro culture. &quot;Ch. quinoa&quot; was brought to the lowlands of south-central Chile at an early date from the Andean highlands. Varieties in the lowlands of south-central Chile derive directly from ancestral cultivars which then evolved in parallel to those of the highlands. It has been suggested that the introduction of &quot;Ch. quinoa&quot; occurred before highland varieties with floury perisperm emerged. There are wide discrepancies in the suggested dates of introduction, one study suggests c. 1000 BC as the introduction date while another suggests 600–1100 AD. In colonial times the plant is known to have been cultivated as far south as the Chiloé Archipelago and the shores of Nahuel Huapi Lake. The cuisine of Chiloé included bread made of Quinoa until at least the mid-19th century.

In Chile it had almost disappeared by the early 1940s; as of 2015 the crop is mostly grown in three areas by only some 300 smallholder farmers. Each of these areas is different: indigenous small-scale growers near the border with Bolivia who grow many types of Bolivian forms, a few farmers in the central region who exclusively grow a white-seeded variety and generally market their crops through a well-known cooperative, and in the south by women in home gardens in Mapuche reserves.

When Amaranthaceae became abundant in Lake Pacucha, Peru, the lake was fresh, and the lack of Amaranthaceae taxa strongly indicates droughts which turned the lake into a saltmarsh. Based on the pollen associated with soil manipulation, this is an area of the Andes where domestication of &quot;C.quinoa&quot; became popular, although it was not the only one. It was domesticated in various geographical zones. With this, morphological adaptations began to happen until having five ecotypes today. Quinoa&#x27;s genetic diversity illustrates that it was and is a vital crop.Andean agronomists and nutrition scientists began researching quinoa in the early twentieth century, and it became the subject of much interest among researchers involved in neglected and underutilized crop studies in the 1970s. 

In 2004, the international community became increasingly interested in quinoa and it entered a boom and bust economic cycle that would last for over ten years. Between 2004 and 2011, quinoa became a more interesting commodity and global excitement for it increased. At this point, Bolivia and Peru were the only major producers of quinoa. In 2013, there was an extreme increase in imports of quinoa by the United States, Canada and various European countries. In 2016, growth began to slow. Imports were still increasing but at a slower rate and quinoa prices declined as other countries began producing it. By 2015, over 75 countries were producing quinoa, as opposed to only eight countries in the 1980s.

Particularly for the high variety of Chilean landraces, in addition to how the plant has adapted to different latitudes, this crop is now potentially cultivable almost anywhere in the world.

===Climate requirements===
The plant&#x27;s growth is highly variable due to the number of different subspecies, varieties and landraces (domesticated plants or animals adapted to the environment in which they originated). However, it is generally undemanding and altitude-hardy; it is grown from coastal regions to over in the Andes near the equator, with most of the cultivars being grown between and . Depending on the variety, optimal growing conditions are in cool climates with temperatures that vary between during the night to near during the day. Some cultivars can withstand lower temperatures without damage. Light frosts normally do not affect the plants at any stage of development, except during flowering. Midsummer frosts during flowering, a frequent occurrence in the Andes, lead to sterilization of the pollen. Rainfall requirements are highly variable between the different cultivars, ranging from during the growing season. Growth is optimal with well-distributed rainfall during early growth and no rain during seed maturation and harvesting.

==== United States ====
Quinoa has been cultivated in the United States, primarily in the high elevation San Luis Valley of Colorado where it was introduced in 1983. In this high-altitude desert valley, maximum summer temperatures rarely exceed and night temperatures are about . In the 2010s, experimental production was attempted in the Palouse region of Eastern Washington, and farmers in Western Washington began producing the crop. The Washington State University Skagit River Valley research facility near Mount Vernon grew thousands of its own experimental varieties. The Puget Sound region&#x27;s climate is similar to that of coastal Chile where the crop has been grown for centuries. Due to the short growing season, North American cultivation requires short-maturity varieties, typically of Bolivian origin. Quinoa is planted in Idaho where a variety developed and bred specifically for the high-altitude Snake River Plain is the largest planted variety in North America.

==== Europe ====
Several countries within Europe have successfully grown quinoa on a commercial scale. Southern England, Holland and Denmark all have significant production. 

=== Sowing ===
Quinoa requires a significant amount of precipitation in order to germinate, therefore the traditional sowing date in Peru was between September and November. To increase the chance that more crops survive it would be advantageous to split up the sowing date among the plants. Traditionally quinoa was sowed by broadcast, in rows or grooves, or by broadcast and then making rows. Soil preparation should occur before sowing, and weeding should come soon after sowing the seeds. 

Rotation is used in its Andean native range. Rotation is common with potato, cereals and legumes including &quot;Lupinus mutabilis&quot;. Traditionally, quinoa rotation happens in plots called aynoqas. These are made up of different sized plots in different zones, and each family unit would own plots in different areas. The aynoqas allowed for better crop yield, agricultural and ecological sustainability, and food security within communities.

===Soil===
Quinoa plants do best in sandy, well-drained soils with a low nutrient content, moderate salinity, and a soil pH of 6 to8.5. The seedbed must be well prepared and drained to avoid waterlogging.

Quinoa has gained attention for its adaptability to contrasting environments such as saline soils, nutrient-poor soils and drought stressed marginal agroecosystems. 

===Genetics===
The genome of quinoa was sequenced in 2017. Through traditional selective breeding and, potentially, genetic engineering, the plant is being modified to have higher crop yield, improved tolerance to heat and biotic stress, and greater sweetness through saponin inhibition.

===Harvesting===
Traditionally, quinoa grain is harvested by hand, and only rarely by machine, because the extreme variability of the maturity period of most quinoa cultivars complicates mechanization. Harvest needs to be precisely timed to avoid high seed losses from shattering, and different panicles on the same plant mature at different times. The crop yield in the Andean region (often around 3 t/ha up to 5 t/ha) is comparable to wheat yields. In the United States, varieties have been selected for uniformity of maturity and are mechanically harvested using conventional small grain combines.

=== Processing ===
The plants are allowed to stand until the stalks and seeds have dried out and the grain has reached a moisture content below 10%.
Handling involves threshing the seedheads from the chaff and winnowing the seed to remove the husk. Before storage, the seeds need to be dried in order to avoid germination. This was traditionally done manually, which is labour-intensive. 

==Production==
In 2023, world production of quinoa was 112,251 tonnes, led by Peru with 62% of the total and Bolivia with 37% (table).

===Price===
Since the early 21st century when quinoa became more commonly consumed in North America, Europe, and Australasia where it was not typically grown, the crop value increased. Between 2006 and 2013, quinoa crop prices tripled. In 2011, the average price was US$3,115 per tonne with some varieties selling as high as $8,000 per tonne. This compares with wheat prices of about US$340 per tonne, making wheat about 10% of the value of quinoa. The resulting effect on traditional production regions in Peru and Bolivia also influenced new commercial quinoa production elsewhere in the world, such as the United States. By 2013, quinoa was being cultivated in some 70 countries. As a result of expanding production outside the Andean highlands native for quinoa, the price plummeted starting in early 2015 and remained low for years. From 2018 to 2019, quinoa production in Peru declined by 22%. Some refer to this as the &quot;quinoa bust&quot; because of the devastation the price fall caused for farmers and industry.

===Effects of rising demand on growers===
Rising quinoa prices over the period of 2006 to 2017 may have reduced the affordability of quinoa to traditional consumers. However, a 2016 study using Peru&#x27;s Encuesta Nacional de Hogares found that rising quinoa prices during 2004–2013 led to net economic benefits for producers, and other commentary indicated similar conclusions, including for women specifically. It has also been suggested that as quinoa producers rise above subsistence-level income, they switch their own consumption to Western processed foods which are often less healthy than a traditional, quinoa-based diet, whether because quinoa is held to be worth too much to keep for oneself and one&#x27;s family, or because processed foods have higher status despite their poorer nutritional value. Efforts are being made in some areas to distribute quinoa more widely and ensure that farming and poorer populations have access to it and have an understanding of its nutritional importance, including use in free school breakfasts and government provisions distributed to pregnant and nursing women in need.

In terms of wider social consequences, research on traditional producers in Bolivia has emphasised a complex picture. The degree to which individual producers benefit from the global quinoa boom depends on its mode of production, for example through producer associations and co-operatives such as the Asociación Nacional de Productores de Quinua (founded in the 1970s), contracting through vertically integrated private firms, or wage labor. State regulation and enforcement may promote a shift to cash-cropping among some farmers and a shift toward subsistence production among others, while enabling many urban refugees to return to working the land, outcomes with complex and varied social effects.

The growth of quinoa consumption outside of its indigenous region has raised concerns over food security of the indigenous original consumers, unsustainably intensive farming of the crop, expansion of farming into otherwise marginal agricultural lands with concurrent loss of the natural environment, threatening both the sustainability of producer agriculture and the biodiversity of quinoa. Studies have found that smallholder traditional farming of quinoa, specifically in the Andean region of Peru has significantly less of an environmental impact in carbon produced, than the modern industrial quinoa production.

World demand for quinoa is sometimes presented in the media particularly as being caused by rising veganism, but one academic has commented that despite the drawbacks of quinoa, meat production in most cases is still less sustainable than quinoa.

===Monoculture and climate change impacts ===

Because of the increasing demand for quinoa, some fields in the Andean region of Bolivia have become quinoa monocultures. Particularly in the Uyuni salt flats, soil degradation has occurred due to mechanized production and decreased vegetation cover after clearing for quinoa fields. This degradation has led to poorer quinoa yields and lower environmental health in the region.

Signs of desertification of the landscape is amplified by the effects of climate change on quinoa fields and the salt flats. Drier and hotter weather negatively affects quinoa production, while also increasing pest populations attacking quinoa and reducing the nutrient quality of the soil.

Quinoa became a grain of growing interest partially due to its ability to withstand many different climate conditions. Its native Andean region is prone to dry and wet spells, and to cold and hot temperatures. Research shows that quinoa prefers warmer temperatures and alternating irrigation. The randomness of weather conditions due to climate change has hindered development of quinoa crops.

The quinoa boom and bust cycle led to a periodic increased demand for quinoa which originally resulted in increased production in its native area. However, when other countries recognized the economic benefit of producing quinoa, its cultivation in Europe and the United States increased. Some studies indicate that it may be more productive to grow quinoa in the United States, particularly in Washington State, and in China rather than in its native regions.

== Chemistry ==
In their natural state, the seeds have a coating that contains bitter-tasting saponins, making them unpalatable. Most of the grain sold commercially has been processed to remove this coating. This bitterness has beneficial effects during cultivation, as it deters birds and, therefore, the plant requires minimal protection. The genetic control of bitterness involves quantitative inheritance. Although lowering the saponin content through selective breeding to produce sweeter, more palatable varieties is complicated by ≈10% cross-pollination, it is a major goal of quinoa breeding programs, which may include genetic engineering.

The toxicity category rating of the saponins in quinoa treats them as mild eye and respiratory irritants and as a low gastrointestinal irritant. In South America, these saponins have many uses, including as a detergent for clothing and washing, and as a folk medicine antiseptic for skin injuries.

Additionally, the leaves and stems of all species of the genus &quot;Chenopodium&quot; and related genera of the family Amaranthaceae, including quinoa, contain high levels of oxalic acid.

== Uses ==
The increasing demand for quinoa is partially due to the attention it received as a food that may help alleviate food insecurity in some world regions. Quinoa is high in protein, which makes it a possible alternative to meat for vegetarians and vegans, and for people who are lactose intolerant. It also has high concentrations of dietary minerals. Quinoa does not contain gluten. Some of these qualities may have improved the market to economically privileged people in North America, possibly increasing the price of quinoa.

Quinoa is an important food for the Indigenous people of the Andean Altiplano, especially the Aymara and Quechua communities. Historically, it was consumed as a subsistence food, which was devalued by the Spanish when they colonized the region. The Spanish noticed that quinoa was consumed everyday and as a part of special ceremonies, so they decided it could grant power to people and threatened their conquest. Because of this they targeted it for extinction and significantly reduced the range where quinoa was grown.

For the Indigenous communities, growing quinoa represented food security and well-being, and it was involved in almost every meal of the day.

=== Nutrition ===

Raw, uncooked quinoa is 13% water, 64% carbohydrates, 14% protein, and 6% fat. Nutritional evaluations indicate that a serving of raw quinoa seeds has a food energy of and is a rich source (20% or higher of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, dietary fiber, several B vitamins, including 46%DV for folate, and for several dietary minerals such as magnesium (55%DV), manganese (95%DV), phosphorus (65%DV), and zinc (33%DV).

After boiling, which is the typical preparation for eating the seeds, many nutritional evaluations change. Although a serving of cooked quinoa increases to 72% water, most nutritional evaluations are reduced, such as, 21% carbohydrates, 4% protein, and 2% fat, and the food energy of cooked quinoa is reduced to . Although similarly reduced, cooked quinoa remains a rich source of the dietary minerals manganese (30%DV) and phosphorus (22%DV). However, cooked quinoa is reduced to being just a moderate source (10–19%DV) of dietary fiber and folate (11%), as well as of the dietary minerals iron (11%), magnesium (18%), and zinc (11%).

Quinoa is gluten-free. Because quinoa has a high concentration of protein and is a good source of many micronutrients, has versatility in preparation, and a potential for increased yields in controlled environments, it has been selected as an experimental crop in NASA&#x27;s Controlled Ecological Life Support System for long-duration human occupied space flights.

== In culture ==

===United Nations recognition===

The United Nations General Assembly declared 2013 as the &quot;&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Resolution 66/221. International Year of Quinoa, 2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of the ancestral practices of the Andean people, who have preserved it as a food for present and future generations, through knowledge and practices of living in harmony with nature. The objective was to draw the world&#x27;s attention to the role that quinoa could play in providing food security, nutrition and poverty eradication in support of achieving Millennium Development Goals. Some academic commentary emphasized that quinoa production could have ecological and social drawbacks in its native regions, and that these problems needed to be tackled.

===Kosher certification===
Quinoa is used in the Jewish community as a substitute for the leavened grains that are forbidden during the Passover holiday. Several kosher certification organizations refuse to certify it as being kosher for Passover, citing reasons including its resemblance to prohibited grains or fear of cross-contamination of the product from nearby fields of prohibited grain or during packaging. However, in December 2013 the Orthodox Union, the world&#x27;s largest kosher certification agency, announced it would begin certifying quinoa as kosher for Passover.

<text>In linguistics, a count noun (also countable noun) is a noun that can be modified by a quantity and that occurs in both singular and plural forms, and that can co-occur with quantificational determiners like &quot;every&quot;, &quot;each&quot;, &quot;several&quot;, etc. A mass noun has none of these properties: It cannot be modified by a number, cannot occur in plural, and cannot co-occur with quantificational determiners.

==Examples==
Below are examples of all the properties of count nouns holding for the count noun &quot;chair&quot;, but not for the mass noun &quot;furniture&quot;. 
* Occurrence in plural.
: There is a chair in the room. (correct)
: There are chairs in the room. (correct)
: There is chair in the room. (incorrect)
: There is a furniture in the room. (incorrect)
: There are furnitures in the room. (incorrect)
: There is furniture in the room. (correct)

* Co-occurrence with count determiners
: Every chair is man-made. (correct)
: There are several chairs in the room. (correct)
: Every furniture is man-made. (incorrect)
: There are several furnitures in the room. (incorrect)

Some determiners can be used with both mass and count nouns, including &quot;some&quot;, &quot;a lot (of)&quot;, &quot;no&quot;. Others cannot: &quot;few&quot; and &quot;many&quot; are used with count items, &quot;little&quot; and &quot;much&quot; with mass nouns. On the other hand, &quot;fewer&quot; is reserved for count and &quot;less&quot; for mass (see Fewer vs. less), but &quot;more&quot; is the proper comparative for both &quot;many&quot; and &quot;much&quot;.

==Grammatical distinction==
The concept of a &quot;mass noun&quot; is a grammatical concept and is not based on the innate nature of the object to which that noun refers. For example, &quot;seven chairs&quot; and &quot;some furniture&quot; could refer to exactly the same objects, with &quot;seven chairs&quot; referring to them as a collection of individual objects but with &quot;some furniture&quot; referring to them as a single undifferentiated unit. However, some abstract phenomena like &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;hope&quot; have properties which make it difficult to refer to them with a count noun. 

Classifiers are sometimes used as count nouns preceding mass nouns, in order to redirect the speaker&#x27;s focus away from the mass nature. For example, &quot;There&#x27;s some &quot;furniture&quot; in the room&quot; can be restated, with a change of focus, to &quot;There are some &quot;pieces&quot; of &quot;furniture&quot; in the room&quot;; and &quot;let&#x27;s have some &quot;fun&quot;&quot; can be refocused as &quot;Let&#x27;s have a &quot;bit&quot; of &quot;fun&quot;&quot;.

In English, some nouns are used most frequently as mass nouns, with or without a classifier (as in &quot;Waiter, I&#x27;ll have some &quot;coffee&quot;&quot; or &quot;Waiter, I&#x27;ll have a &quot;cup&quot; of &quot;coffee&quot;&quot;), but also, less frequently, as count nouns (as in &quot;Waiter, we&#x27;ll have three &quot;coffees&quot;.&quot;)

==Theory==
Following the work of logicians like Godehard Link and linguists like Manfred Krifka, we know that the mass/count distinction can be given a precise mathematical definition in terms of notions like cumulativity and quantization. Discussed by Barry Schein in 1993, a new logical framework, called plural logic, has also been used for characterizing the semantics of count nouns and mass nouns.

==Linguistic differences==
Some languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, treat all nouns as mass nouns, and need to make use of a noun classifier (see &quot;Chinese classifier&quot;) to add numerals and other quantifiers. The following examples are of nouns which, while seemingly innately countable, are still treated as mass nouns:

* 那个人吃完了/那個人吃完了 (nà gè rén chī wán le) – &quot;That unit (of) person has eaten&quot;, &quot;That person has eaten&quot;
* 那三个人吃完了/那三個人吃完了 (nà sān gè rén chī wán le) – &quot;Those three unit (of) person have eaten&quot;, &quot;Those three people have eaten&quot;
* 她有七本书/她有七本書 (tā yǒu qī běn shū) – &quot;She has seven volume (of) book&quot;, &quot;She has seven books.&quot;

A classifier, therefore, implies that the object(s) referred to are countable in the sense that the speaker intends them to be enumerated, rather than considered as a unit (regardless of quantity). Notice that the classifier changes as the unit being counted changes.

Words such as &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;rice&quot; are not so obviously countable entities, but they can be counted with an appropriate unit of measure in both English and Mandarin (e.g., &quot;&quot;glasses&quot; of milk&quot; or &quot;&quot;spoonfuls&quot; of rice&quot;).

The use of a classifier is similar to, but not identical with, the use of units of measurement to count &quot;groups&quot; of objects in English. For example, in &quot;three shelves of books&quot;, where &quot;shelves&quot; is used as a unit of measurement.

On the other hand, some languages, like Turkish, treat all the nouns (even things which are not obviously countable) as countable nouns.

* – &quot;The rice (lit. &quot;rices&quot;) hasn&#x27;t been cooked well yet&quot;
* – &quot;The milk (lit. &quot;milks&quot;) has been spilled all over the floor (lit. &quot;floors&quot;)&quot;
* – &quot;The rivers&#x27; water (lit. &quot;waters&quot;) flows very nicely&quot;
* – &quot;They are distributing books for the people without money&quot;

Even then, it is possible to use units of measures with numbers in Turkish, even with the very obviously countable nouns. The Turkish nouns can not take a plural suffix after the numbers and the units of measure.

* – &quot;five glasses of milk&quot;
* – &quot;two spoonfuls of rice&quot;
* – &quot;three units of person&quot;
* – &quot;Four square meters of floor&quot;
* – &quot;seven shelves of book&quot;

<doc id="53459" wikidata="Q120411" url="?curid=53459" title="Inayat Khan">
<text>Inayat Khan Rehmat Khan (; 5 July 1882 – 5 February 1927) was an Indian professor of musicology, singer, exponent of the saraswati vina, poet, philosopher, and pioneer of the transmission of Sufism to the West. At the urging of his students, and on the basis of his ancestral Sufi tradition and four-fold training and authorization at the hands of Sayyid Abu Hashim Madani (d. 1907) of Hyderabad, he established an order of Sufism (the Sufi Order) in London in 1914. By the time of his death in 1927, centers had been established throughout Europe and North America, and multiple volumes of his teachings had been published.

==Early life==
Inayat Khan was born in Baroda to a noble Mughal family. His paternal ancestors, comprising yüzkhans (Central Asian lords) and bakshys (shamans), were Turkmen from the Chagatai Khanate who settled in Sialkot, Punjab during the reign of Amir Timur. Inayat Khan&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Sangit Ratna Maulabakhsh Sholay Khan, was a Hindustani classical musician and educator known as “the Beethoven of India.” His maternal grandmother, Qasim Bibi, was from the royal house of Tipu Sultan of Mysore.

==Sufism==
Inayat Khan&#x27;s Sufi sources included both the traditions of his paternal ancestors (remembered as the Mahashaikhan) and the tutelage he received from Sayyid Abu Hashim Madani. From the latter he inherited four transmissions, constituting succession in the Chishti, Suhrawardi, Qadiri, and Naqshbandi orders of Sufism. Of these, the Chishti lineage, traced through the Delhi-based legacy of Shah Kalim Allah Jahanabadi, was primary.

==Travels==
Inayat Khan toured the United States with his brother Maheboob Khan and cousin Mohammed Ali Khan between the years 1910 and 1912. Further travels took him to England, France, and Russia. During the First World War, living in London, he oversaw the founding of an order of Sufism under his guidance. Following the war he traveled widely, and numerous Sufi centers sprang up in his wake in Europe and the U.S. He ultimately settled in Suresnes, France, at the house and khanqah (Sufi lodge) known as Fazal Manzil.

==Teaching==
Inayat Khan&#x27;s teaching emphasized the oneness of God (tawhid) and the underlying harmony of the revelations communicated by the prophets of all the world&#x27;s great religions. His discourses treated such varied subjects as religion, art, music, ethics, philosophy, psychology, and health and healing. The primary concern of Inayat Khan&#x27;s teaching was the mystical pursuit of God-realization. To this end he established an Inner School comprising four stages of contemplative study based on the traditional Sufi disciplines of &quot;mujahada&quot;, &quot;muraqaba&quot;, &quot;mushahada&quot;, and &quot;mu‘ayyana&quot;, which he rendered in English as concentration, contemplation, meditation, and realization.

===Foundational principles===
Ten principles, known as the Ten Sufi Thoughts, enunciate the universal spiritual values that are foundational to Inayat Khan&#x27;s mystical philosophy.

# There is One God, the Eternal, the Only Being; none exists save God.
# There is One Master, the Guiding Spirit of all Souls, Who constantly leads followers towards the light.
# There is One Holy Book, the sacred manuscript of nature, the only scripture which can enlighten the reader.
# There is One Religion, the unswerving progress in the right direction towards the ideal, which fulfills the life&#x27;s purpose of every soul.
# There is One Law, the law of reciprocity, which can be observed by a selfless conscience together with a sense of awakened justice.
# There is One Brotherhood and Sisterhood, the human brotherhood and sisterhood, which unites the children of earth indiscriminately in the Parenthood of God.
# There is One Moral, the love which springs forth from self-denial, and blooms in deeds of beneficence.
# There is One Object of Praise, the beauty which uplifts the heart of its worshippers through all aspects from the seen to the unseen.
# There is One Truth, the true knowledge of our being, within and without, which is the essence of all wisdom.
# There is One Path, the annihilation of the false ego in the real, which raises the mortal to immortality, and in which resides all perfection.

==Family and personal life==
In New York, he met the woman who would become his wife, Ora Ray Ameena Begum née Baker. They had four children: Vilayat Inayat Khan, Hidayat Inayat Khan, Noor Inayat Khan, and Khair-un-Nisa Inayat Khan.

==Death and legacy==

In 1926 Inayat Khan returned to India; he died of pneumonia in Delhi on 5 February 1927. He is buried in the Inayat Khan dargah in Nizamuddin, Delhi. The dargah is open to the public and hosts qawwali sessions.

<doc id="53460" wikidata="Q21131" url="?curid=53460" title="Statcoulomb">
<text>The statcoulomb (statC), franklin (Fr), or electrostatic unit of charge (esu) is the unit of measurement for electrical charge used in the centimetre–gram–second electrostatic units variant (CGS-ESU) and Gaussian systems of units. In terms of the Gaussian base units, it is
That is, it is defined so that the proportionality constant in Coulomb&#x27;s law using CGS-ESU quantities is a dimensionless quantity equal to 1.

== Definition and relation to CGS base units ==
Coulomb&#x27;s law in the CGS-Gaussian system takes the form
formula_1
where &quot;F&quot; is the force, &quot;q&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are the two electric charges, and &quot;r&quot; is the distance between the charges. This serves to define charge as a quantity in the Gaussian system.

The statcoulomb is defined such that if two electric charges of 1 statC each and have a separation of , the force of mutual electrical repulsion is 1 dyne. Substituting &quot;F&quot; = 1 dyn, &quot;q&quot; = &quot;q&quot; = 1 statC, and &quot;r&quot; = 1 cm, we get:
From this it is also evident that the quantity dimension of electric charge as defined in the CGS-ESU and Gaussian systems is .

== Conversion between systems ==
Conversion of a quantity to the corresponding quantity of the International System of Quantities (ISQ) that underlies the International System of Units (SI) by using the defining equations of each system.

The SI uses the coulomb (C) as its unit of electric charge. The conversion factor between corresponding quantities with the units coulomb and statcoulomb depends on which quantity is to be converted. The most common cases are:
* For electric charge:
* For electric flux ():
* For electric flux density ():

The symbol &quot;≘&quot; (&#x27;corresponds to&#x27;) is used instead of &quot;=&quot; because the two sides cannot be equated.

<text>Cinnabar (; ), or cinnabarite (), also known as &quot;mercurblende&quot; is the bright scarlet to brick-red form of mercury(II) sulfide (HgS). It is the most common source ore for refining elemental mercury and is the historic source for the brilliant red or scarlet pigment termed vermilion and associated red mercury pigments.

Cinnabar generally occurs as a vein-filling mineral associated with volcanic activity and alkaline hot springs. The mineral resembles quartz in symmetry and it exhibits birefringence. Cinnabar has a mean refractive index near 3.2, a hardness between 2.0 and 2.5, and a specific gravity of approximately 8.1. The color and properties derive from a structure that is a hexagonal crystalline lattice belonging to the trigonal crystal system, crystals that sometimes exhibit twinning.

Cinnabar has been used for its color since antiquity in the Near East, including as a rouge-type cosmetic, in the New World since the Olmec culture, and in China since as early as the Yangshao culture, where it was used in coloring stoneware. In Roman times, cinnabar was highly valued as paint for walls, especially interiors, since it darkened when used outdoors due to exposure to sunlight.

Associated modern precautions for the use and handling of cinnabar arise from the toxicity of the mercury component, which was recognized as early as ancient Rome.

== Etymology ==
The name comes from Greek (), a Greek word most likely applied by Theophrastus to several distinct substances. In Latin, it was sometimes known as &quot;minium&quot;, meaning also &quot;red cinnamon&quot;, though both of these terms now refer specifically to lead tetroxide.

== Properties and structure ==

=== Properties ===
Cinnabar is generally found in a massive, granular, or earthy form and is bright scarlet to brick-red in color, though it occasionally occurs in crystals with a nonmetallic adamantine luster. It resembles quartz in its symmetry. It exhibits birefringence, and it has the second-highest refractive index of any mineral. Its mean refractive index is 3.08 (sodium light wavelengths), versus the indices for diamond and the non-mineral gallium(III) arsenide (GaAs), which are 2.42 and 3.93, respectively. The hardness of cinnabar is 2.0–2.5 on the Mohs scale, and its specific gravity 8.1.

=== Structure ===

Structurally, cinnabar belongs to the trigonal crystal system. It occurs as thick tabular or slender prismatic crystals or as granular to massive incrustations. Crystal twinning occurs as simple contact twins.

Mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, adopts the cinnabar structure described, and one additional structure, i.e. it is dimorphous. Cinnabar is the more stable form, and is a structure akin to that of HgO: each Hg center has two short Hg−S bonds (each 2.36 Å), and four longer contacts (with 3.10, 3.10, 3.30 and 3.30 Å separations). In addition, HgS is found in a black, non-cinnabar polymorph (metacinnabar) that has the zincblende structure.

== Occurrence ==

Cinnabar generally occurs as a vein-filling mineral associated with volcanic activity and alkaline hot springs. Cinnabar is deposited by epithermal ascending aqueous solutions (those near the surface and not too hot) far removed from their igneous source. It is associated with native mercury, stibnite, realgar, pyrite, marcasite, opal, quartz, chalcedony, dolomite, calcite, and barite.

Cinnabar is found in essentially all mineral extraction localities that yield mercury, notably Almadén (Spain). This mine was exploited from Roman times until 1991, being for centuries the most important cinnabar deposit in the world. Good cinnabar crystals have also been found there. Cinnabar deposits appear in Giza (Egypt); Puerto Princesa (Philippines); Red Devil, Alaska; Murfreesboro, Arkansas; New Almaden Mine in San Jose, California; New Idria, California, the Hastings Mine and St. John&#x27;s Mine both in Vallejo, California; Terlingua, Texas (United States); Idrija (Slovenia); near Obermoschel in the Palatinate; the La Ripa and Levigliani mines at the foot of the Apuan Alps and in Mount Amiata (Tuscany, Italy); Avala (Serbia); Huancavelica (Peru); the province of Guizhou in China and Western ghats in India where fine crystals have been obtained. It has been found in Dominica near its sulfur springs at the southern end of the island along the west coast.
Cinnabar is still being deposited, such as from the hot waters of Sulphur Bank Mine in California and Steamboat Springs, Nevada (United States).

== Mining and extraction of mercury ==

As the most common source of mercury in nature, cinnabar has been mined for thousands of years, even as far back as the Neolithic Age. During the Roman Empire it was mined both as a pigment, and for its mercury content.

To produce liquid mercury (quicksilver), crushed cinnabar ore is roasted in rotary furnaces. Pure mercury separates from sulfur in this process and easily evaporates. A condensing column is used to collect the liquid metal, which is most often shipped in iron flasks.

== Toxicity ==

Associated modern precautions for use and handling of cinnabar arise from the toxicity of the mercury component, which was recognized as early as in ancient Rome. Because of its mercury content, cinnabar can be toxic to human beings. Overexposure to mercury, mercury poisoning (mercurialism), was seen as an occupational disease to the ancient Romans. Though people in ancient South America often used cinnabar for art, or processed it into refined mercury (as a means to gild silver and gold to objects), the toxic properties of mercury were well known. It was dangerous to those who mined and processed cinnabar; it caused shaking, loss of sense, and death. Data suggests that mercury was retorted from cinnabar and the workers were exposed to the toxic mercury fumes. &quot;Mining in the Spanish cinnabar mines of Almadén, southwest of Madrid, was regarded as being akin to a death sentence due to the shortened life expectancy of the miners, who were slaves or convicts.&quot;

== Decorative use ==
Cinnabar has been used for its color since antiquity in the Near East, including as a rouge-type cosmetic, in the New World since the Olmec culture, and in China for writing on oracle bones as early as the Zhou dynasty. Late in the Song dynasty it was used in coloring lacquerware.

Cinnabar&#x27;s use as a color in the New World, since the Olmec culture, is exemplified by its use in royal burial chambers during the peak of Maya civilization, most dramatically in the 7th-century tomb of the Red Queen in Palenque, where the remains of a noble woman and objects belonging to her in her sarcophagus were completely covered with bright red powder made from cinnabar.
The most popularly known use of cinnabar is in Chinese carved lacquerware, a technique that apparently originated in the Song dynasty. The danger of mercury poisoning may be reduced in ancient lacquerware by entraining the powdered pigment in lacquer, but could still pose an environmental hazard if the pieces were accidentally destroyed. In the modern jewellery industry, the toxic pigment is replaced by a resin-based polymer that approximates the appearance of pigmented lacquer.

Two female mummies dated AD 1399 to 1475 found in Cerro Esmeralda in Chile in 1976 had clothes colored with cinnabar.

== Other forms ==
* Hepatic cinnabar, or paragite, is an impure brownish variety from the mines of Idrija in the Carniola region of Slovenia, in which the cinnabar is mixed with bituminous and earthy matter.
* Hypercinnabar crystallizes at high temperature in the hexagonal crystal system.
* Metacinnabar is a black-colored form of mercury(II) sulfide, which crystallizes in the cubic crystal system.
* Synthetic cinnabar is produced by treatment of mercury(II) salts with hydrogen sulfide to precipitate black, synthetic metacinnabar, which is then heated in water. This conversion is promoted by the presence of sodium sulfide.

<text>Louis Gathmann (August 11, 1843 – June 3, 1917) was a German American engineer and an inventor who is best remembered as the inventor of the Gathmann gun, a large howitzer.

==Early life==
Gathmann was born in 1843 in Hanover. His father was a school teacher, and instilled in his son a lifelong love of astronomy.

==Career==
He moved to the United States in 1864, and eventually moved to Chicago where he lived until the end of the 19th century, when he moved to Washington, D.C. He started his career designing equipment for mills and farms, and held numerous patents. By the 1880s, Gathmann&#x27;s patents were in such demand that he had to form a company to help track and produce his designs. This company, known as the Garden City Mill Furnishing Company, made milling machines which were sold all over the globe.

By the 1880s, Gathmann had made enough money to have his family moved to the United States from Prussia. He also had four mansions built, two in Chicago, one in Washington D.C., and one in Baltimore, Maryland. Gathmann was very interested in astronomy and had three observatories built in the Chicago area during the 1880s, one of which was a domed observatory tower which he had installed on the side of his mansion on Lincoln Avenue. 

In the 1890s, Louis had invented a &quot;Sectional Telescope Lens&quot; (US Patent 531,994, and 591,466). The design called for using individual pre-ground disks of glass mounted in a black matrix. The entire assembly would then be ground as if it were a traditional single-piece telescope lens blank. This would allow for a faster and cheaper method of producing large diameter telescope lenses for institutional observatories. He had been in negotiations with Alfred Huntington Isham to produce a 100-ft diameter telescope for the Proctor Memorial Fund, with the plan calling for an international observatory on Mt. San Miguel and renaming the mountain as Mt. Gathmann. 

Louis was also involved in 19th century weather modification projects, and in 1891 received a patent (US Patent 462,795) for a rain-making in which liquid carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere by explosion (either from an artillery shell or by being carried aloft by a balloon). He also wrote a book on the subject, &quot;Rain Produced At Will&quot;. The book included a chapter by the scientist Simon Newcomb, and another by Edwin J. Houston who would later go on to co-found General Electric. After World War II, when General Electric was experimenting with Rainmaking (now called Weather modification) Stanford Law Review stated: &quot;In fact, if one Gathmann were alive today, and his patent had not long since expired, he might have an action for patent infringement.&quot;

From the 1890s on, Louis Gathmann focused on ordnance development. The largest gun designed by Gathmann was the 18-inch Gathmann Gun, which was a coastal defense gun manufactured by Bethlehem Steel under Emil Gathmann (head of Bethlehem Steel&#x27;s Ordnance Section, and one of Gathmann&#x27;s sons). The gun was tested at Sandy Hook, but the projectile performed far worse than traditional armor-piercing rounds. Louis was also involved with early aircraft development and had attempted to develop a helicopter, but his successes came in developing fuses for high-explosive ordnance. Newspapers reported in the spring of 1915 that Gathmann invented the German 42-cm Big Bertha howitzer, and that these plans were subsequently stolen from the U.S. Patent Office. But these rumors were false, as no such blueprints were ever filed.

During World War I, Louis conceived a multi-hull naval armor design which incorporated buffer zones, shocks and deflectors.

==Personal life==

Gathmann was married. He had three sons and two daughters, Otto, Emil, Paul, Mrs. Foley and Emma.

Gathmann died on June 3, 1917, at the home of his daughter in Washington, D.C. He was buried in Glenwood Cemetery.

<doc id="53469" wikidata="Q28165" url="?curid=53469" title="Cinnamon">
<text>Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several tree species from the genus &quot;Cinnamomum&quot;. Cinnamon is used mainly as an aromatic condiment and flavouring additive in a wide variety of cuisines, sweet and savoury dishes, breakfast cereals, snack foods, bagels, teas, hot chocolate and traditional foods. The aroma and flavour of cinnamon derive from its essential oil and principal component, cinnamaldehyde, as well as numerous other constituents including eugenol.

Cinnamon is the name for several species of trees and the commercial spice products that some of them produce. All are members of the genus &quot;Cinnamomum&quot; in the family Lauraceae. Only a few &quot;Cinnamomum&quot; species are grown commercially for spice. &quot;Cinnamomum verum&quot; (alternatively &quot;C. zeylanicum&quot;), known as &quot;Ceylon cinnamon&quot; after its origins in Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon), is considered to be &quot;true cinnamon&quot;, but most cinnamon in international commerce is derived from four other species, usually and more correctly referred to as &quot;cassia&quot;: &quot;C. burmanni&quot; (Indonesian cinnamon or Padang cassia), &quot;C. cassia&quot; (Chinese cinnamon or Chinese cassia), &quot;C. loureiroi&quot; (Saigon cinnamon or Vietnamese cassia), and the less common &quot;C. citriodorum&quot; (Malabar cinnamon). 

In 2021, world production of cinnamon was 226,753 tonnes, led by China with 43% of the total.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;cinnamon&quot;, attested in English since the 15th century, deriving from the Ancient Greek (, later κίνναμον : ), via Latin and medieval French intermediate forms. The Greek was borrowed from a Phoenician word, which was similar to the related Hebrew word ().

The name &quot;cassia&quot;, first recorded in late Old English from Latin, ultimately derives from the Hebrew word , a form of the verb , &quot;to strip off bark&quot;.

Early Modern English also used the names &quot;canel&quot; and &quot;canella&quot;, similar to the current names of cinnamon in several other European languages, which are derived from the Latin word , a diminutive of , &quot;tube&quot;, from the way the bark curls up as it dries.

== History ==

Cinnamon has been known from remote antiquity. It was imported to Egypt as early as 2000 BC, but those who reported that it had come from China had confused it with &quot;Cinnamomum cassia&quot;, a related species. Cinnamon was so highly prized among ancient nations that it was regarded as a gift fit for monarchs and even for a deity; an inscription records the gift of cinnamon and cassia to the temple of Apollo at Miletus. Its source was kept a trade secret in the Mediterranean world for centuries by those in the spice trade, in order to protect their monopoly as suppliers.

&quot;Cinnamomum verum&quot;, which translates from Latin as &quot;true cinnamon&quot;, is native to India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar. &quot;Cinnamomum cassia&quot; (cassia) is native to China. Related species, all harvested and sold in the modern era as cinnamon, are native to Vietnam (&quot;Saigon cinnamon&quot;), Indonesia and other southeast Asian countries with warm climates.

In Ancient Egypt, cinnamon was used to embalm mummies. From the Ptolemaic Kingdom onward, Ancient Egyptian recipes for kyphi, an aromatic used for burning, included cinnamon and cassia. The gifts of Hellenistic rulers to temples sometimes included cassia and cinnamon.

The first Greek reference to is found in a poem by Sappho in the 7th century BC. According to Herodotus, both cinnamon and cassia grew in Arabia, together with incense, myrrh and , and were guarded by winged serpents. Herodotus, Aristotle and other authors named Arabia as the source of cinnamon; they recounted that giant &quot;cinnamon birds&quot; collected the cinnamon sticks from an unknown land where the cinnamon trees grew and used them to construct their nests.

Pliny the Elder wrote that cinnamon was brought around the Arabian Peninsula on &quot;rafts without rudders or sails or oars&quot;, taking advantage of the winter trade winds. He also mentioned cassia as a flavouring agent for wine, and that the tales of cinnamon being collected from the nests of cinnamon birds was a traders&#x27; fiction made up to charge more. However, the story remained current in Byzantium as late as 1310.

According to Pliny the Elder, a Roman pound () of cassia, cinnamon (), cost up to 1,500 , the wage of fifty months&#x27; labour. Diocletian&#x27;s Edict on Maximum Prices from 301 AD gives a price of 125 for a pound of cassia, while an agricultural labourer earned 25 per day. Cinnamon was too expensive to be commonly used on funeral pyres in Rome, but the Emperor Nero is said to have burned a year&#x27;s worth of the city&#x27;s supply at the funeral for his wife Poppaea Sabina in AD 65.

===Middle Ages===
Through the Middle Ages, the source of cinnamon remained a mystery to the Western world. From reading Latin writers who quoted Herodotus, Europeans had learned that cinnamon came up the Red Sea to the trading ports of Egypt, but where it came from was less than clear. When the Sieur de Joinville accompanied his king, Louis IX of France to Egypt on the Seventh Crusade in 1248, he reported—and believed—what he had been told: that cinnamon was fished up in nets at the source of the Nile out at the edge of the world (i.e., Ethiopia). Marco Polo avoided precision on the topic.

The first mention that the spice grew in the area of India was in Maimonides&#x27;s Mishneh Torah, about 1180. The first mention that the spice grew specifically in Sri Lanka was in Zakariya al-Qazwini&#x27;s (&quot;Monument of Places and History of God&#x27;s Bondsmen&quot;) about 1270. This was followed shortly thereafter by John of Montecorvino in a letter of about 1292.

Indonesian rafts transported cinnamon directly from the Moluccas to East Africa (see also Rhapta), where local traders then carried it north to Alexandria in Egypt. Venetian traders from Italy held a monopoly on the spice trade in Europe, distributing cinnamon from Alexandria. The disruption of this trade by the rise of other Mediterranean powers, such as the Mamluk sultans and the Ottoman Empire, was one of many factors that led Europeans to search more widely for other routes to Asia.

===Early modern period===
During the 1500s, Ferdinand Magellan was searching for spices on behalf of Spain; in the Philippines, he found , which was closely related to &quot;C. zeylanicum&quot;, the cinnamon found in Sri Lanka. This cinnamon eventually competed with Sri Lankan cinnamon, which was controlled by the Portuguese.

In 1638, Dutch traders established a trading post in Sri Lanka, took control of the manufactories by 1640, and expelled the remaining Portuguese by 1658. &quot;The shores of the island are full of it,&quot; a Dutch captain reported, &quot;and it is the best in all the Orient. When one is downwind of the island, one can still smell cinnamon eight leagues out to sea.&quot; The Dutch East India Company continued to overhaul the methods of harvesting in the wild and eventually began to cultivate its own trees.

In 1767, Lord Brown of the British East India Company established the Anjarakkandy Cinnamon Estate near Anjarakkandy in the Kannur district of Kerala, India. It later became Asia&#x27;s largest cinnamon estate. The British took control of Ceylon from the Dutch in 1796.

== Cultivation ==

Cinnamon is an evergreen tree characterized by oval-shaped leaves, thick bark and a berry fruit. When harvesting the spice, the bark and leaves are the primary parts of the plant used. However, in Japan, the more pungent roots are harvested in order to produce &quot;nikki&quot; (ニッキ) which is a product distinct from cinammon (シナモン &quot;shinamon&quot;). Cinnamon is cultivated by growing the tree for two years, then coppicing it, i.e., cutting the stems at ground level. The following year, about a dozen new shoots form from the roots, replacing those that were cut. A number of pests such as &quot;Colletotrichum gloeosporioides&quot;, &quot;Diplodia&quot; species and &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; (stripe canker) can affect the growing plants.

The stems must be processed immediately after harvesting while the inner bark is still wet. The cut stems are processed by scraping off the outer bark, then beating the branch evenly with a hammer to loosen the inner bark, which is then pried off in long rolls. Only of the inner bark is used; the outer, woody portion is discarded, leaving metre-long cinnamon strips that curl into rolls (&quot;quills&quot;) on drying. The processed bark dries completely in four to six hours, provided it is in a well-ventilated and relatively warm environment. Once dry, the bark is cut into lengths for sale.

A less than ideal drying environment encourages the proliferation of pests in the bark, which may then require treatment by fumigation with sulphur dioxide. In 2011, the European Union approved the use of sulphur dioxide at a concentration of up to for the treatment of &quot;C. verum&quot; bark harvested in Sri Lanka.

=== Species ===
A number of species are often sold as cinnamon:
* &quot;Cinnamomum cassia&quot; (cassia or Chinese cinnamon, the most common commercial type in the USA)
* &quot;C. burmanni&quot; (Korintje, Padang cassia, or Indonesian cinnamon)
* &quot;C. loureiroi&quot; (Saigon cinnamon, Vietnamese cassia, or Vietnamese cinnamon)
* &quot;C. verum&quot; (Sri Lanka cinnamon, Ceylon cinnamon or Cinnamomum zeylanicum)
* &quot;C. citriodorum&quot; (Malabar cinnamon)

Cassia induces a strong, spicy flavour and is often used in baking, especially associated with cinnamon rolls, as it handles baking conditions well. Among cassia, Chinese cinnamon is generally medium to light reddish-brown in colour, hard and woody in texture, and thicker ( thick), as all of the layers of bark are used. Ceylon cinnamon, using only the thin inner bark, has a lighter brown colour and a finer, less dense, and more crumbly texture. It is subtle and more aromatic in flavour than cassia and it loses much of its flavour during cooking.

The barks of the species are easily distinguished when whole, both in macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Ceylon cinnamon sticks (quills) have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or spice grinder, whereas cassia sticks are much harder. Indonesian cinnamon is often sold in neat quills made up of one thick layer, capable of damaging a spice or coffee grinder. Saigon cinnamon (&quot;C. loureiroi&quot;) and Chinese cinnamon (&quot;C. cassia&quot;) are always sold as broken pieces of thick bark, as the bark is not supple enough to be rolled into quills.

The powdered bark is harder to distinguish, but if it is treated with tincture of iodine (a test for starch), little effect is visible with pure Ceylon cinnamon; however, when Chinese cinnamon is present, a deep-blue tint is produced.

===Grading===

The Sri Lankan grading system divides the cinnamon quills into four groups:
* Alba, less than in diameter
* Continental, less than in diameter
* Mexican, less than in diameter
* Hamburg, less than in diameter

These groups are further divided into specific grades. For example, Mexican is divided into M00000 special, M000000 and M0000, depending on quill diameter and number of quills per kilogram. Any pieces of bark less than long are categorized as quillings. Featherings are the inner bark of twigs and twisted shoots. Chips are trimmings of quills, outer and inner bark that cannot be separated, or the bark of small twigs.

==Production==

In 2021, four countries accounted for 98% of the world&#x27;s cinnamon production, a total of 226,753 tonnes: China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka.

===Counterfeit===
True cinnamon from &quot;C. verum&quot; bark can be mixed with cassia (&quot;C. cassia&quot;) as counterfeit and falsely marketed as authentic cinnamon. In one analysis, authentic Ceylon cinnamon bark contained 12-143 mg/kg of coumarin a phenolic typically low in content in true cinnamon but market samples contained coumarin with levels as high as 3462 mg/kg, indicating probable contamination with cassia in the counterfeit cinnamon. ConsumerLab.com found the same problem in a 2020 analysis; &quot;a supplement that contained the highest amount of coumarin was labeled as Ceylon cinnamon&quot;.

== Food uses ==

Cinnamon bark is used as a spice. It is principally employed in cookery as a condiment and flavouring material. It is used in the preparation of chocolate, especially in Mexico. Cinnamon is often used in savoury dishes of chicken and lamb. In the United States and Europe, cinnamon and sugar are often used to flavour cereals, bread-based dishes such as toast, and fruits, especially apples; a cinnamon and sugar mixture (cinnamon sugar) is sold separately for such purposes. It is also used in Portuguese and Turkish cuisine for both sweet and savoury dishes. Cinnamon can also be used in pickling, and in Christmas drinks such as eggnog. Cinnamon powder has long been an important spice in enhancing the flavour of Persian cuisine, used in a variety of thick soups, drinks and sweets.

Cinnamon is a common ingredient in Jewish cuisine across various communities. In Sephardic cooking, it is incorporated into vegetable stews and desserts such as &quot;tishpishti&quot; and &quot;travados&quot;, both of which are soaked in honey. In Ashkenazi cuisine, cinnamon features in dishes like honey cakes, and &quot;kugels&quot;. It is also one of &quot;four sibling spices&quot; (&quot;rempah empat beradik&quot;) essential in Malay cuisine along with clove, star anise and cardamom.

==Nutrient composition==

Ground cinnamon is 11% water, 81% carbohydrates (including 53% dietary fiber), 4% protein and 1% fat.

==Characteristics==

===Texture===
Ceylon cinnamon may be crushed into small pieces by hand while Indonesian cinnamon requires a powerful blender.

===Flavour, aroma and taste===
The flavour of cinnamon is due to the aromatic essential oils that makes up 0.5 to 1% of its composition. 

Cinnamon bark can be macerated, then extracted in 80% ethanol, to a tincture.

Cinnamon essential oil can be prepared by roughly pounding the bark, macerating it in sea water, and then quickly distilling the whole. It is of a golden-yellow colour, with the characteristic odour of cinnamon and a very hot aromatic taste. 

&quot;Cinnamon oil nanoemulsion&quot; can be made with polysorbate 80, cinnamon essential oil, and water, by ultrasonic emulsification.

&quot;Cinnamon oil macroemulsion&quot; can be made with a dispersing emulsifying homogenizer.&lt;ref name=&quot;homogenizers/ultra-turrax-t-25&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The pungent taste and scent come from cinnamaldehyde, about 90% of the essential oil from cinnamon bark. Cinnamaldehyde decomposes, in high humidity and high temperatures, to styrene, and, by reaction with oxygen as it ages, it darkens in colour and forms resinous compounds.

Cinnamon constituents include some 80 aromatic compounds, including eugenol, found in the oil from leaves or bark of cinnamon trees.

====Alcohol flavorant====
Cinnamon is used as a flavoring in cinnamon liqueur, such as cinnamon-flavored whiskey in the United States, and , a cinnamon brandy in Greece.

==Health-related research==
Cinnamon has a long history of use in traditional medicine as a digestive aid. However, contemporary studies are unable to find evidence of any significant medicinal or therapeutic effect.

Reviews of clinical trials reported lowering of fasting plasma glucose and inconsistent effects on hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c, an indicator of chronically elevated plasma glucose). Four of the reviews reported a decrease in fasting plasma glucose, only two reported lower HbA1c, and one reported no change to either measure. The Cochrane review noted that trial durations were limited to 4 to 16 weeks, and that no trials reported on changes to quality of life, morbidity or mortality rate. The Cochrane authors&#x27; conclusion was: &quot;There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.&quot; Citing the Cochrane review, the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health stated: &quot;Studies done in people don&#x27;t support using cinnamon for any health condition.&quot; However, the results of the studies are difficult to interpret because it is often unclear what type of cinnamon and what part of the plant were used.

A meta-analysis of cinnamon supplementation trials with lipid measurements reported lower total cholesterol and triglycerides, but no significant changes in LDL-cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol. Another reported no change to body weight or insulin resistance.

==Toxicity==

A systematic review of adverse events as a result of cinnamon use reported gastrointestinal disorders and allergic reactions as the most frequently reported side effects.

In 2008, the European Food Safety Authority considered the toxicity of coumarin, a component of cinnamon, and confirmed a maximum recommended tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.1 mg of coumarin per kg of body weight. Coumarin is known to cause liver and kidney damage in high concentrations and metabolic effect in humans with CYP2A6 polymorphism. Based on this assessment, the European Union set a guideline for maximum coumarin content in foodstuffs of 50 mg per kg of dough in seasonal foods, and 15 mg per kg in everyday baked foods. The maximum recommended TDI of 0.1 mg of coumarin per kg of body weight equates to 5 mg of coumarin (or 5.6 g C. verum with 0.9 mg coumarin per gram) for a body weight of 50 kg. C as shown in the table below:

Due to the variable amount of coumarin in &quot;C. cassia&quot;, usually well over 1.0 mg of coumarin per g of cinnamon and sometimes up to 12 times that, &quot;C. cassia&quot; has a low safe-intake-level upper limit to adhere to the above TDI. In contrast, &quot;C. verum&quot; has only trace amounts of coumarin.

In March 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration recommended a voluntary recall on 6 brands of cinnamon due to contamination with lead, after an investigation stemming from 500 reports of child lead poisoning across the US. The FDA determined that cinnamon was adulterated with lead chromate.

<doc id="53472" wikidata="Q182593" url="?curid=53472" title="Illusion">
<text>An illusion is a distortion of the senses, which can reveal how the mind normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation. Although illusions distort the human perception of reality, they are generally shared by most people.

Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions (optical illusions) are the best-known and understood. The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses. For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice as coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words.

Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception. These assumptions are made using organizational principles (e.g., Gestalt theory), an individual&#x27;s capacity for depth perception and motion perception, and perceptual constancy. Other illusions occur due to biological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside the body within one&#x27;s physical environment.

The term &quot;illusion&quot; refers to a specific form of sensory distortion. Unlike a hallucination, which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus, an illusion describes a misinterpretation of a true sensation. For example, hearing voices regardless of the environment would be a hallucination, whereas hearing voices in the sound of running water (or another auditory source) would be an illusion. So, it should not be wrong to consider that illusions are just &quot;misinterpretations&quot; on how our brain perceives something that exists (unlike a hallucination where a stimulus is absent).

==Visual==


A visual illusion or optical illusion is characterized by visually perceived images that are deceptive or misleading. Therefore, the information gathered by the visual sense is processed to create a percept that does not tally with information from other senses or physical measurements.

The visual system, which includes the eyes (namely the retinas) and the central nervous system (namely the brain&#x27;s visual cortex), constructs reality through both perceptual and cognitive neural pathways. Visual illusions are (at least in part) thought to be caused by excessive competing stimuli. Each stimulus follows a dedicated neural path in the early stages of visual processing, and intense/repetitive activity or interaction with active adjoining channels (perceptual neural circuits, usually at the same level) causes a physiological imbalance that alters perception. During low-level visual processing, the retinal circuit arranges the information in the photoreceptors, by creating initial visual percepts from the patterns of light which fall on the retina. The Hermann grid illusion and Mach bands are two illusions that are widely considered to be caused by a biological phenomenon named lateral inhibition, where the receptor signal in the retina&#x27;s receptive fields from light and dark areas compete with one another.

The assembly of visual elements into a collective percept, that distinguishes objects from backgrounds, takes part during intermediate-level visual processing. Many common visual illusions are a consequence of the percept constructed during this processing stage, as the elements first captured during low-level processing might easily be interpreted to form an image that differs from objective reality. An example is when two objects of the same size are placed on a certain background which conditions us to believe that one object might be larger than the other, and when the background is removed or replaced our perception immediately changes to the correct scenario (effectively concluding that both objects have equal dimensions).

High-level visual processing consolidates information gathered from various sources to apply cognitive influences that create a conscious visual experience. Thus, allowing us to recognize the complex identity of different elements, and the disparate relations between them through cognitive processes. Visual illusions are also often a product of this processing stage, and it is during this stage that we might ultimately become conscious of any optical illusion. There are two crucial properties of our visual system related mostly to high-level visual processing, referred to as selectivity and invariance (which we have consistently attempted to replicate in image recognition computer algorithms). Selectivity refers to the identification of particular features that are relevant to recognize a specific element or object, while abstracting from other features that are not fundamental to performing the same recognition (e.g. when we see the shape of a house, certain contours that are essential for us to recognize it while other contours or image properties are not, such as color). On the other hand, invariance refers to the ability to be indifferent to small variations of a given feature, effectively identifying all those variations as simply being different versions of the same feature (e.g. we can recognize a given handwritten letter of the alphabet, written by different people with distinct styles of calligraphy).

The whole process that constructs our visual experience is extremely complex (with multiple qualities that are unmatched by any computer or digital system). It is organized by many sequential and parallel sub-processes, each of which is essential in building our conscious image of the world. Our whole visual system seeks to simplify and categorize the unstructured low-level visual information, through both selectivity and invariance. Thus, while trying to organize an image by &quot;filling in the gaps&quot; through assumptions, we become vulnerable to misinterpretation.

==Auditory==

An auditory illusion is an illusion of hearing, the auditory equivalent of a visual illusion: the listener hears either sounds which are not present in the stimulus, or &quot;impossible&quot; sounds. In short, audio illusions highlight areas where the human ear and brain, as organic, makeshift tools, differ from perfect audio receptors (for better or for worse). One example of an auditory illusion is a Shepard tone.

==Tactile==

Examples of tactile illusions include phantom limb, the thermal grill illusion, the cutaneous rabbit illusion and a curious illusion that occurs when the crossed index and middle fingers are run along the bridge of the nose with one finger on each side, resulting in the perception of two separate noses. The brain areas activated during illusory tactile perception are similar to those activated during actual tactile stimulation. Tactile illusions can also be elicited through haptic technology. These &quot;illusory&quot; tactile objects can be used to create &quot;virtual objects&quot;.

==Temporal==

A temporal illusion is a distortion in the perception of time, which occurs when the time interval between two or more events is very narrow (typically less than a second). In such cases, a person may momentarily perceive time as slowing down, stopping, speeding up, or running backward.

==Intersensory==
Illusions can occur with the other senses including those involved in food perception. Both sound and touch have been shown to modulate the perceived staleness and crispness of food products. It was also discovered that even if some portion of the taste receptor on the tongue became damaged that illusory taste could be produced by tactile stimulation. Evidence of olfactory (smell) illusions occurred when positive or negative verbal labels were given prior to olfactory stimulation. The McGurk effect shows that what we hear is influenced by what we see as we hear the person speaking; the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound.

==Disorders==
Some illusions occur as a result of an illness or a disorder. While these types of illusions are not shared with everyone, they are typical of each condition. For example, people with migraines often report fortification illusions.

==Neuroscience==
Perception is linked to specific brain activity and so can be elicited by brain stimulation. The (illusory) percepts that can be evoked range from simple phosphenes (detections of lights in the visual field) to high-level percepts. In a single-case study on a patient undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy treatment, electrical stimulation at the left temporo-parietal junction evoked the percept of a nearby (illusory) person who &quot;closely &#x27;shadowed&#x27; changes in the patient&#x27;s body position and posture&quot;.

<doc id="53474" wikidata="Q737323" url="?curid=53474" title="Tenrikyo">
<text>is a Japanese new religion which is neither strictly monotheistic nor pantheistic, originating from the teachings of a 19th-century woman named Nakayama Miki, known to her followers as &quot;Oyasama&quot;. Followers of Tenrikyo believe that God of Origin, God in Truth, known by several names including &quot;Tsukihi,&quot; &quot;Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto&quot; and &quot;Oyagamisama&quot; revealed divine intent through Miki Nakayama as the Shrine of God and to a lesser extent the roles of the Honseki Izo Iburi and other leaders. Tenrikyo&#x27;s worldly aim is to teach and promote the Joyous Life, which is cultivated through acts of charity and mindfulness called .

The primary operations of Tenrikyo today are located at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters, which supports 16,833 locally managed churches in Japan, the construction and maintenance of the and various community-focused organisations. It has 1.75 million followers in Japan and is estimated to have over 2 million worldwide.

==Beliefs==
The ultimate spiritual aim of Tenrikyo is the construction of the Kanrodai, a divinely ordained pillar in an &quot;axis mundi&quot; called the Jiba, and the correct performance of the Kagura ritual around the Kanrodai, which will bring about the salvation of all human beings. The idea of the Jiba as the origin of earthly creation is called , or the principle of origin. A pilgrimage to the Jiba is interpreted as a return to one&#x27;s origin, and is thus also known as . As such, the greeting ( &#x27;welcome home&#x27;) can be seen at many hotels and guesthouses in Tenri City.

Other key teachings include:
* (堪能) – a constructive attitude towards troubles, illness and difficulties
* (十全の守護) – ten principles involved in the creation, which exist in and are considered to be applied continuously throughout the universe

===Joyous Life===
The Joyous Life in Tenrikyo is defined as charity and abstention from greed, selfishness, hatred, anger, covetousness, miserliness, grudge bearing, and arrogance. Negative tendencies are not known as sins in Tenrikyo, but rather as &quot;dust&quot; that can be swept away from the mind through (ひのきしん or 日の寄進) and prayer. , voluntary effort, is performed not out of a desire to appear selfless, but out of gratitude for and .

===Ontology===
The most basic teaching of Tenrikyo is (貸物借物 or 貸し物借り物), meaning &quot;a thing lent, a thing borrowed&quot;. The thing that is lent and borrowed is the human body. Tenrikyo followers think of their minds as things that are under their own control, but their bodies are not completely under their control.

===God===
The sacred name of the single God and creator of the entire universe in Tenrikyo is . Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto created humankind so that humans may live joyously and to partake in that joy. The body is a thing borrowed, but the mind alone is one&#x27;s own, thus it is commonly accepted that Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto is not omnipotent.

Other gods are considered instruments, such as the Divine Providences, and were also created by Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto.

Tenrikyo&#x27;s doctrine names four properties of Tenri-O-no-Mikoto: as the God who became openly revealed in the world, as the creator who created the world and humankind, as the sustainer and protector who gives existence and life to all creation, and as the savior whose intention in becoming revealed is to save all humankind.

Through her scriptures (the , , and ), Nakayama conveyed the concept of the divine to her followers in steps:

*Firstly as . was a familiar term for her followers since they commonly referred to the spirits of the ethnic religion of Shinto, which were worshipped and venerated in Japan. To differentiate this divinity from the Shinto spirits, Oyasama clarified its characteristics with phrases such as and .
*Secondly as . The moon and sun could be understood as visual manifestations of the divine. Just as those bodies impartially give the world light and warmth at all times of the day, the workings of the divine are also impartial and constant.
*Finally as . The relationship between the divine and human beings is the mutual feeling of love between a parent and his or her children. The divine does not want to command and punish human beings, but rather to guide and nurture them so that they may live joyfully and cheerfully together. (親) is both paternal and maternal, not simply one or the other.

These steps have been described as an &quot;unfolding in the revelation of God&#x27;s nature in keeping with the developing capacity of human understanding, from an all-powerful God, to a nourishing God, and finally to an intimate God.&quot;

Followers use the phrase (親神様) to refer to God, and the divine name &quot;Tenri-O-no-Mikoto&quot; when praising or worshipping God through prayer or ritual.

===Causality===
====Comparison to karmic belief====

The concept of in Tenrikyo is a unique understanding of karmic belief. Although causality resembles karmic beliefs found in religious traditions originating in ancient India, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, Tenrikyo&#x27;s doctrine does not claim to inherit the concept from these traditions and differs from their explanations of karma in a few significant ways.

Broadly speaking, karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect). In other words, a person&#x27;s good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering. Causality and karma are interchangeable in this sense; throughout life a person may experience good and bad causality. In Tenrikyo, the concept is encapsulated in the farming metaphor, &quot;every seed sown will sprout.&quot; Karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth, such that one&#x27;s past deeds in the current life and in all previous lives are reflected in the present moment, and one&#x27;s present deeds are reflected in the future of the current life and in all future lives. This understanding of rebirth is upheld in causality as well.

Tenrikyo&#x27;s ontology, however, differs from older karmic religious traditions such as Buddhism. In Tenrikyo, the human person is believed to consist of mind, body, and soul. The mind, which is given the freedom to sense, feel, and act by God the Parent, ceases to function at death. On the other hand, the soul, through the process of , takes on a new body lent from God the Parent and is reborn into this world. Though the reborn person has no memory of the previous life, the person&#x27;s thoughts and deeds leave their mark on the soul and are carried over into the new life as the person&#x27;s causality. As can be seen, Tenrikyo&#x27;s ontology, which rests on the existence on a single creator deity (God the Parent), differs from Buddhist ontology, which does not contain a creator deity. Also Tenrikyo&#x27;s concept of salvation, which is to live the Joyous Life in this existence and therefore does not promise a liberated afterlife outside of this existence, differs from Buddhist concepts of saṃsāra and nirvana.

====&quot;Original causality&quot;====
At the focal point of Tenrikyo&#x27;s ontological understanding is the positing of , which is that God the Parent created human beings to see them live the Joyous Life (the salvific state) and to share in that joy. Tenrikyo teaches that the Joyous Life will eventually encompass all humanity, and that gradual progress towards the Joyous Life is even now being made with the guidance of divine providence. Thus the concept of original causality has a teleological element, being the gradual unfolding of that which was ordained at the beginning of time.

====&quot;Individual causality&quot;====
Belief in individual causality is related to the principle of original causality. Individual causality is divine providence acting to realize the original causality of the human race, which through the use of suffering guides individuals to realize their causality and leads them to a change of heart and active cooperation towards the establishment of the Joyous Life, the world that was ordained at the beginning of time.

Tenrikyo&#x27;s doctrine explains that an individual&#x27;s suffering should not be perceived as punishment or retributive justice from divine providence for past misdeeds, but rather as a sign of encouragement from divine providence for the individual to reflect on the past and to undergo a change of heart. The recognition of the divine providence at work should lead to an attitude of , a Japanese word that indicates a state of satisfaction. is a way of settling the mind – it is not to merely resign oneself to one&#x27;s situation, but rather to actively &quot;recognize God&#x27;s parental love in all events and be braced by their occurrence into an ever firmer determination to live joyously each day.&quot; In other words, Tenrikyo emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive inner disposition, as opposed to a disposition easily swayed by external circumstance.

====&quot;Three causalities&quot;====
In addition, &quot;The Doctrine of Tenrikyo&quot; names that are believed to predetermine the founding of Tenrikyo&#x27;s teachings. More precisely, these causalities are the fulfillment of the promise that God made to the models and instruments of creation, which was that &quot;when the years equal to the number of their first born had elapsed, they would be returned to the Residence of Origin, the place of original conception, and would be adored by their posterity.&quot; The &quot;Causality of the Soul of Oyasama&quot; denotes that Miki Nakayama had the soul of the original mother at creation (Izanami-no-Mikoto), who conceived, gave birth to, and nurtured humankind. The &quot;Causality of the Residence&quot; means that the Nakayama Residence, where Tenrikyo Church Headquarters stands, is the place that humankind was conceived. The &quot;Causality of the Promised Time&quot; indicates that October 26, 1838 – the day when God became openly revealed through Miki Nakayama – marked the time when the years equal to the number of first-born humans (900,099,999) had elapsed since the moment humankind was conceived.

==Texts==
===Scriptures===
The of Tenrikyo are the , , and .

The is the most important Tenrikyo scripture. A 17-volume collection of 1,711 poems, the was composed by the foundress of Tenrikyo, Miki Nakayama, from 1869 to 1882.

The is the text of the , a religious ritual that has a central place in Tenrikyo. During the Service, the text to the is sung together with dance movements and musical accompaniment, all of which was composed and taught by Nakayama.

The is a written record of oral revelations given by Izo Iburi. The full scripture is published in seven volumes (plus an index in three volumes) and contains around 20,000 &quot;divine directions&quot; delivered between January 4, 1887 and June 9, 1907.

According to Shozen Nakayama, the second (the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo), the &quot;reveal[s] the most important principles of the faith,&quot; the Mikagura-uta &quot;come[s] alive through singing or as the accompaniment&quot; to the Service, and the Osashizu &quot;gives concrete precepts by which the followers should reflect on their own conduct.&quot;

===Supplemental texts to the scriptures===
The constitute three officially sanctioned texts which, along with the scriptures, are used to instruct students and adherents of Tenrikyo. They are required texts for students enrolling in Tenrikyo&#x27;s seminary programs, such as the three-month .

&quot;The Doctrine of Tenrikyo&quot; is Tenrikyo&#x27;s official doctrine, which explains the basic teachings of Tenrikyo. &quot;The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo&quot; is Tenrikyo&#x27;s official hagiography of Miki Nakayama. The &quot;Anecdotes of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo&quot; is an official authorized anthology of anecdotes about Nakayama that were passed down orally by her first followers and later written down and verified.

== Organization ==

Tenrikyo is subdivided into many different groups with common goals but differing functions. These range from the , to disaster relief corps, medical staff and hospitals, universities, museums, libraries, and various schools.

Tenri Judo is renowned as a successful competition style of Judo that has produced many champions, while there are also other sporting and arts interest groups within Tenrikyo.

==History==

In Tenrikyo tradition, Nakayama Miki was chosen as the Shrine of God in 1838, after her son and husband began suffering from serious ailments. The family called a Buddhist monk to exorcise the spirit causing the ailments. When the monk temporarily left and asked Nakayama to take over, she was possessed by the One god (Tenri-O-no-Mikoto), who demanded that Nakayama be given to God as a shrine. Nakayama&#x27;s husband gave in to this request three days later.

Nakayama&#x27;s statements and revelations as Shrine of God were supplemented by Izo Iburi, one of her earliest followers, who developed a position of revelatory leadership as her deputy, answering questions from followers and giving &quot;timely talks&quot;. His position, which is no longer held in Tenrikyo, was called . The revelatory transmissions of the were written down and collected in large, multi-volume works called . Following Izo&#x27;s death, a woman called partially carried on this role for a while, although it appears that she did not have the actual title of . Since then, Tenrikyo itself has never had a , although some Tenrikyo splinter groups believe that the revelatory leadership passed from Iburi to their particular founder or foundress.

Nakayama&#x27;s eldest son obtained a license to practice branch of Shinto, but did so against his mother&#x27;s wishes. Tenrikyo was designated as one of the thirteen groups included in Sect Shinto between 1908 and 1945, due to the implementation of Heian policy under State Shinto. During this time, Tenrikyo became the first new religion to do social work in Japan, opening an orphanage, a public nursery and a school for the blind.

Although Tenrikyo is now completely separate from Shinto and Buddhism organizationally, it still shares many of the traditions of Japanese religious practice. For instance, many of the objects used in Tenrikyo religious services, such as and , were traditionally used in Japanese ritual, and the method of offering is also traditional.

==Religious services==

Tenrikyo utilises traditional musical instruments in its , such as (wooden clappers), (cymbals), (small gong), (large drum), (shoulder drum), (bamboo flute), , , and . These are used to play music from the , a body of music, dances and songs created by Nakayama. Most of the world&#x27;s foremost authorities on music (the ancient classical Shinto music of the imperial court of Japan) are also Tenrikyo followers, and music is actively promoted by Tenrikyo, although, strictly speaking, the and are separate musical forms.

The , , , , and were traditionally the men&#x27;s instruments but are now acceptable for women to play. The , , and were traditionally women&#x27;s instruments and, although not very popular, are now acceptable for men to play as well.

===Daily services===
The ( or ) or daily service consists of the performance of the seated service and, optionally, the practice of a chapter or two of the 12 chapters of ( or ) or . The daily service is performed twice a day; once in the morning and then in the evening. The service times are adjusted according to the time of sunrise and sunset but may vary from church to church. Service times at the Jiba in Tenri City go by this time schedule and adjust in the changing of seasons.

Instruments used in the daily service are the , , , , and (a counter, to count the 21 times the first section is repeated). The is always played by the head minister of the church or mission station. If the head minister is not present, anyone may take their place.

The daily service does not need to be performed at a church. It can be done at any time and anywhere, so long as the practitioner faces the direction of the Jiba, or &quot;home of the parent&quot;.

The purpose of the daily service, as taught by Nakayama, is to sweep away the Eight Mental Dusts of the mind.
 ( or ) () is a spontaneous action that is an expression of gratitude and joy for being allowed to &quot;borrow&quot; his or her body from God the Parent. Such an action ideally is done as an act of religious devotion out of a wish to help or bring joy to others, without any thought of compensation. can range from helping someone to just a simple smile to brighten another person&#x27;s day. Examples of common activities that are encouraged include cleaning public bathrooms and parks among other such acts of community service. Doing the work that others want to do least are considered sincere in the eyes of God.

 is a method of &quot;sweeping&quot; the &quot;mental dusts&quot; that accumulate in a person&#x27;s mind. The &quot;mental dusts&quot; are referring to the Eight Mental Dusts. The official translations of these dusts are: , , , , , , , and .

The Tenrikyo Young Men&#x27;s Association and Tenrikyo Women&#x27;s Association are Tenrikyo-based groups that perform group activities as public service. To participate in such groups may be considered .

===Monthly services===

 (月次祭) or the monthly service is a performance of the entire , the sacred songs of the service, which is the service for world salvation. Generally, mission headquarters and grand churches (churches with 100 or more others under them) have monthly services performed on the third Sunday of every month; other churches perform on any other Sunday of the month. The monthly service at the Jiba is performed on the 26th of every month, the day of the month in which Tenrikyo was first conceived – October 26, 1838.

Instruments used in the monthly service are all of those aforementioned. Performers also include dancers – three men and three women – and a singer. Performers wear traditional kimono, which may or may not be required depending on the church.

===Divine Grant of ===
The Divine Grant of is a healing prayer in which one may attain through attending the nine lectures. When one receives the Divine Grant of , one is considered a (). The is to be administered to those who are suffering from illness to request God&#x27;s blessings for a recovery. However, recovery requires the sincere effort from both the recipient and the administrator of the to clean their minds of &quot;mental dust.&quot; Only with pure minds then can the blessings be received by the recipient through the administering the . It is taught that when God accepts the sincerity of the person administering the and the sincerity of the person to whom it is being administered, a wondrous salvation will be bestowed. This is accomplished through having the recipient be aware of the mental dusts and the teachings of Tenrikyo to remedy their dusty minds.

<text>Dave Berg (June 12, 1920 in Brooklyn – May 17, 2002 in Marina del Rey, California) was an American cartoonist, most noted for his five decades of work in &quot;Mad&quot; of which &quot;The Lighter Side of...&quot; was the most famous.

==Early life==

Berg showed early artistic talents, attending Pratt Institute when he was 12 years old, and later studying at Cooper Union. He served a period of time in the Army Air Forces. In 1940, he joined Will Eisner&#x27;s studio, where he wrote and drew for the Quality Comics line. Berg&#x27;s work also appeared in Dell Comics and Fawcett Publications, typically on humorous back-up features. Beginning in the mid-1940s, he worked for several years with Stan Lee on comic books at Timely Comics (now known as Marvel Comics), ranging from &quot;Combat Kelly&quot; and &quot;The Ringo Kid&quot; to &quot;Tessie the Typist&quot;. He also freelanced for a half-dozen other companies, including EC Comics. Berg retains notoriety as a contributing “good girl artist” during the 50s and 60s for such publications as editor Abe Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Humorama,&quot; rendering attractive women using pinup stylings generally in the form of one-panel humorous gags. Berg&#x27;s body of contributions during this period rank him alongside recognized contemporaries such as Bill Ward and Bill Wenzel. Beginning in 1983, he worked for a Jewish children&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Moshiach Times&quot;.

==&quot;Mad&quot;==
Berg began at &quot;Mad&quot; in 1957, early in Al Feldstein&#x27;s term as editor. Berg had distinct facial features and was heavyset, so inducing Feldstein to write, &quot;Physically, Dave looks like he kept his nose to the grindstone a little too long, and the rest of his body in the steam room not long enough.&quot; For four years, he provided satirical looks at areas such as boating, babysitting, and baseball. In 1961, he started the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Lighter Side&quot; feature, his most famous creation. Berg would take an omnibus topic (such as &quot;Noise,&quot; &quot;Spectators&quot; or &quot;Dog Owners&quot;) and deliver approximately 15 short multi-panel cartoons on the subject. Beginning in #218 (October 1980), he abandoned the thematic approach, and thereafter covered multiple topics in each article. Berg often included caricatures of his own family—headed by his cranky hypochondriac alter ego, Roger Kaputnik—as well as of the &quot;Mad&quot; editorial staff. Occasionally he drew fellow artists, including Don Martin in #110 (April 1967) and Al Jaffee in #119 (June 1968).

His artistic style made Berg one of the more realistic &quot;Mad&quot; artists, although his characters managed to sport garish early-1970s wardrobes well into the 1990s. The art chores for a 1993 article, &quot;The First Day of School 30 Years Ago and Today&quot;, were split between Berg and Rick Tulka, since Berg&#x27;s old-fashioned appeal made him an ideal choice to depict the gentle nostalgia of 1963. The artist&#x27;s lightweight gags and sometimes moralistic tone were roughly satirized by the &quot;National Lampoon&quot;&#x27;s 1971 &quot;Mad&quot; parody, which included a hard-hatted conservative and a longhaired hippie finding their only common ground by choking and beating Berg. However, &quot;The Lighter Side&quot; had a long run as the magazine&#x27;s most popular feature. &quot;Mad&quot; editor Nick Meglin often sketched layouts of &quot;Lighter Side&quot; panels. Sixteen original collections by Berg were published as paperbacks between 1964 and 1987.

Berg held an honorary doctorate in theology. He produced regular religious-themed work for &quot;Moshiach Times&quot; and the B&#x27;nai Brith newsletter. His interaction with &quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s atheist publisher Bill Gaines was suitably irreverent: Berg would tell Gaines, &quot;God bless you,&quot; and Gaines would reply, &quot;Go to Hell.&quot;

Fellow &quot;Mad&quot; contributor Al Jaffee described Berg&#x27;s unique personality in 2009: &quot;Dave had a messianic complex of some sort. He was battling ... he had good and evil inside of him, clashing all the time. It was sad, in a sense, because he wanted to be taken very seriously, and you know, the staffers at &quot;Mad&quot; just didn&#x27;t take anything seriously. Most of all, ourselves ... It came out in a lot of the things he did. He had a very moralistic personality ... He wrote a book called &quot;My Friend God&quot;. And of course, if you write a book like that, you just know that the &quot;Mad&quot; staff is going to make fun of you. We would ask him questions like, &quot;Dave, when did you and God become such good friends? Did you go to college together, or what?&quot;

In this faith connection, Berg was additionally hired to contribute content to The Magazine For Jewish Children, The Moshiach Times, by Rabbi Dr. Dovid Sholom Pape. According to Pape: &quot;He was a wonderful writer and humorist, and he had a great Jewish heart. I asked him to prepare a series of cartoons that would, in a humorous way, illustrate basic ideas in Torah. To do this, he invented a fat character called Schlemiel who would always misunderstand things, and then there would be a couple of boys who would correct him.&quot; In 2002, Berg told an interviewer, &quot;There was a psychiatrist who filed my &quot;Lighter Sides&quot; in categories. When a patient would tell him their troubles, he would pull out one of my sequences and say, &#x27;See, it happens to everyone.&#x27;&quot;

His characters occasionally made their way into other artists&#x27; works, such as Kaputnik finding himself a patient in a Mort Drucker spoof of &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, tagged &quot;with apologies to Dave Berg&quot;.

Berg contributed to &quot;Mad&quot; for 46 years until his death, appearing in 368 issues. His final hand-drawn strip appeared in Mad issue #423. His last set of &quot;Lighter Side&quot; strips, which had been written but not penciled, were illustrated after Berg&#x27;s death by 18 of &quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s other artists as a final tribute; this affectionate send-off included the magazine&#x27;s final new contributions from Jack Davis and George Woodbridge. This tribute appeared in Mad issue #427.

Between 2008 and 2017, Berg&#x27;s old &quot;Lighter Side&quot; gags were given rewritten word balloons with inappropriately &quot;un-Berg-like&quot; humor by longtime &quot;Mad&quot; writer Dick DeBartolo and other staffers, while the art was unchanged. The twelve installments of this irregular feature were called &quot;The Darker Side of the Lighter Side.&quot;

Berg&#x27;s other work included the comic strips &quot;Citizen Senior&quot; (1989–93), &quot;Roger Kaputnik&quot; (1992) and &quot;Astronuts&quot; (1994).

==Death==
After a long battle with cancer, he died in his home in Marina del Rey, California, shortly after midnight on May 17, 2002. Berg was survived by his wife of 52 years, Vivian, and their two children, Mitch and Nancy.

<doc id="53478" wikidata="Q1746129" url="?curid=53478" title="Vulcan, Alberta">
<text>Vulcan is a town in southern Alberta, Canada that is surrounded by Vulcan County. It is on Highway 23, midway between the cities of Calgary and Lethbridge. The population of the town was 1,769 in 2021. Now known as the &quot;Official Star Trek Capital of Canada&quot;, Vulcan has a tourism building made to look like a landed space station, a statue of the original series &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and other &quot;Star Trek&quot; themed attractions.

== History ==

Vulcan was named by a surveyor for the Canadian Pacific Railway after the Roman God of Fire – Vulcan. Originally, all the streets of Vulcan were named after gods and goddesses of the classical world such as Juno, Mars, and Jupiter.

The community was incorporated as a village on December 23, 1912, and then as a town on June 15, 1921. In July 1927, a major tornado destroyed many homes and the new curling rink in the town. That tornado was made famous when a photograph of it approaching Vulcan was used for the &quot;tornado&quot; article in &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

The first newspaper to serve the area was &quot;The Vulcan Review&quot;, which began in 1912 and was published for one year. &quot;The Vulcan Review&quot; was followed by the &quot;Vulcan Advocate&quot; in 1913, which is still being published today as member of Sun Media Community Newspapers part of Postmedia Network.Vulcan once had nine grain elevators, more than any other location west of Winnipeg, making it the largest grain shipping point at that time. Due to the changing economics of the agricultural industry, the original elevators were taken down one by one. Today, Vulcan has only one of the &quot;prairie skyscrapers&quot; left that once could be seen miles away. Although not original, this last wooden elevator was built in the 1980s.

A British Commonwealth Air Training Plan air force base, RCAF Station Vulcan, was located southwest of the town during the Second World War. Many of the old hangars still exist and the runways can still be seen. It is now operated as Vulcan/Kirkcaldy Aerodrome and some of the old runways are still in use. There is a second airport, Vulcan Airport.

In 2015 the town council voted to form Heritage Advisory Board Committee to manage the historical sites in Vulcan County.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Vulcan had a population of 1,769 living in 806 of its 876 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,917. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Vulcan recorded a population of 1,917 living in 829 of its 879 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 1,836. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

== Economy ==
The town&#x27;s economy is mainly tourism and agriculture-based. Wheat, canola and barley are the main crops grown in the Vulcan area.

Oil and gas is another industry that employs many residents of Vulcan.

=== Tourism ===

Since 1990, Vulcan has hosted the annual Vulcan Tinman Triathlon, which takes place at the beginning of June. This sprint-distance triathlon attracts nearly 1,000 participants. There are classes for adults of all ages and skill levels as well as for teams and children.

The town&#x27;s name has brought some attention that has helped it become a tourist attraction. In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television and feature film series it is the name of the homeworld of Mr. Spock and his fellow Vulcans. Capitalizing on this coincidence, the town has built a &quot;Star Trek&quot;–themed tourist station (the Vulcan Tourism &amp; Trek Station), which provides tourist information, displays an extensive donated collection of &quot;Star Trek&quot; memorabilia. The Trek Station also offers unique photo opportunities and interactions with iconic Star Trek characters in their ever-evolving Cosplay Costume Collection. Nearby, a replica of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; from &quot;Star Trek V&quot; has been mounted on a pedestal which includes writing from &quot;Star Trek&quot; alien languages such as Klingon. In 2010 Leonard Nimoy visited the town and was honoured at the town centre with a bust and handprint. A transporter, Doctors Mural and other Star Trek attractions can be experienced throughout the town. The Vulcan Tourism &amp; Trek Station has hosted an annual Star Trek Convention (held the last weekend in July) &quot;VulCON&quot; since 1993 where celebrity guests are &quot;beamed&quot; in to spend the weekend with attendees. It is a unique convention in that celebrity guests &amp; Trekkies get to know each other during the Meet &amp; Greet, Q&amp;As and a banquet and dance. This convention attracts hundreds of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans from around the world.

The town also hosts another annual event called &quot;Spock Days&quot;. This is a family-friendly weekend with a parade, children&#x27;s spaces, a ball tournament, fireworks and more.

<text>2060 Chiron is a ringed small Solar System body in the outer Solar System, orbiting the Sun between Saturn and Uranus. Discovered in 1977 by Charles Kowal, it was the first-identified member of a new class of objects now known as centaurs—bodies orbiting between the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt. Chiron is named after the centaur Chiron in Greek mythology.

Although it was initially called an asteroid and classified only as a minor planet with the designation &quot;2060 Chiron&quot;, in 1989 it was found to exhibit behavior typical of a comet. Today it is classified as both a minor planet and a comet, and is accordingly also known by the cometary designation 95P/Chiron. More recently, a series of occultation events through the 2010s and early 2020s revealed that Chiron hosts rings, making it one of four minor planets and the only known comet to host a ring system.

== History ==

=== Discovery ===

Chiron was discovered on 1 November 1977 by Charles Kowal from images taken on 18 October at Palomar Observatory. It was given the temporary designation of . It was found near aphelion and at the time of discovery it was the most distant known minor planet. Chiron was even claimed as the tenth planet by the press. Chiron was later found on several precovery images, going back to 1895, which allowed its orbit to be accurately determined. It had been at perihelion in 1945 but was not discovered then because there were few searches being made at that time, and these were not sensitive to slow-moving objects. The Lowell Observatory&#x27;s survey for distant planets would not have gone down faint enough in the 1930s and did not cover the right region of the sky in the 1940s. The April 1895 precovery image was one month after the March 1895 perihelion.

=== Naming ===

This minor planet was named after Chiron, a half-human, half-horse centaur from Greek mythology. Son of the Titan Cronus and the nymph Philyra, Chiron was the wisest and most just of all centaurs, serving as an instructor of the Greek heroes. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 April 1978 (). It was suggested that the names of other centaurs be reserved for objects of the same type.

Chiron, along with most major and minor planetary bodies, is not generally given a symbol in astronomy. A symbol was devised for it by Al H. Morrison and is mostly used among astrologers: it resembles a key as well as an OK monogram for Object Kowal.

== Orbit ==

Chiron&#x27;s orbit was found to be highly eccentric (0.37), with perihelion just inside the orbit of Saturn and aphelion just outside the perihelion of Uranus (it does not reach the average distance of Uranus, however). According to the program Solex, Chiron&#x27;s closest approach to Saturn in modern times was around May 720, when it came within million km () of the planet. During this passage Saturn&#x27;s gravity caused Chiron&#x27;s semi-major axis to decrease from AU to 13.7 AU. Chiron&#x27;s orbit does not intersect Uranus&#x27; orbit.

Chiron attracted considerable interest because it was the first object discovered in such an orbit, well outside the asteroid belt. Chiron is classified as a centaur, the first of a class of objects orbiting between the outer planets. Chiron is a Saturn–Uranus object because its perihelion lies in Saturn&#x27;s zone of control and its aphelion lies in that of Uranus. Centaurs are not in stable orbits and will be removed by gravitational perturbation by the giant planets over a period of millions of years, moving to different orbits or leaving the Solar System altogether. Chiron likely comes from the Kuiper belt and will probably become a short-period comet in about a million years. Chiron came to perihelion (closest point to the Sun) in 1996 and aphelion in May 2021.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Spectral type ===

The visible and near-infrared spectrum of Chiron is neutral, and is similar to that of C-type asteroids and the nucleus of Halley&#x27;s Comet. The near-infrared spectrum of Chiron shows absence of water ice.

=== Rotation period ===

Four rotational light curves of &quot;Chiron&quot; were taken from photometric observations between 1989 and 1997. Lightcurve analysis gave a concurring, well-defined rotational period of 5.918 hours with a small brightness variation of 0.05 to 0.09 magnitude, which indicates that the body has a rather spheroidal shape ().

=== Diameter ===

The assumed size of an object depends on its absolute magnitude (H) and the albedo (the amount of light it reflects). In 1984 Lebofsky estimated Chiron to be about 180 km in diameter. Estimates in the 1990s were closer to 150 km in diameter. Occultation data from 1993 suggests a diameter of about 180 km. Combined data from the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2007 and the Herschel Space Observatory in 2011 suggests that Chiron is in diameter. Therefore, Chiron may be as large as 10199 Chariklo. The diameter of Chiron is difficult to estimate in part because the true absolute magnitude of its nucleus is uncertain due to its highly variable cometary activity.

=== Cometary behavior ===

In February 1988, at 12 AU from the Sun, Chiron brightened by 75 percent. This is behavior typical of comets but not asteroids. Further observations in April 1989 showed that Chiron had developed a cometary coma, A tail was detected in 1993. Chiron differs from other comets in that water is not a major component of its coma, because it is too far from the Sun for water to sublimate. In 1995 carbon monoxide was detected in Chiron in very small amounts, and the derived CO production rate was calculated to be sufficient to account for the observed coma. Cyanide was also detected in the spectrum of Chiron in 1991. At the time of its discovery, Chiron was close to aphelion, whereas the observations showing a coma were done closer to perihelion, perhaps explaining why no cometary behavior had been seen earlier. The fact that Chiron is still active probably means it has not been in its current orbit very long.

Chiron is officially designated as both a comet—95P/Chiron—and a minor planet, an indication of the sometimes fuzzy dividing line between the two classes of object. The term proto-comet has also been used. Being about 220 km in diameter, it is unusually large for a comet nucleus. Chiron was the first member of a new family of Chiron-type comets (CTC) with (TJupiter &gt; 3; a &gt; aJupiter). Other CTCs include: 39P/Oterma, 165P/LINEAR, 166P/NEAT, and 167P/CINEOS. There are also non-centaur asteroids that are simultaneously classified as comets, such as 4015 Wilson–Harrington, 7968 Elst–Pizarro, and 118401 LINEAR.

Since the discovery of Chiron, other centaurs have been discovered, and nearly all are currently classified as minor planets, but are being observed for possible cometary behavior. 60558 Echeclus has displayed a cometary coma and now also has the cometary designation 174P/Echeclus. After passing perihelion in early 2008, 52872 Okyrhoe significantly brightened.

== Rings ==

Chiron has rings, similar to the better-established rings of 10199 Chariklo. Based on unexpected occultation events observed in stellar-occultation data obtained on 7 November 1993, 9 March 1994, and 29 November 2011, which were initially interpreted as resulting from jets associated with Chiron&#x27;s comet-like activity, Chiron&#x27;s rings were proposed to be in radius and sharply defined. The rings&#x27; changing appearance at different viewing angles can largely explain the long-term variation in Chiron&#x27;s brightness and hence estimates of Chiron&#x27;s albedo and size. Moreover, it can, by assuming that the water ice is in Chiron&#x27;s rings, explain the changing intensity of the infrared water-ice absorption bands in Chiron&#x27;s spectrum, including their disappearance in 2001 (when the rings were edge-on). Also, the geometric albedo of Chiron&#x27;s rings as determined by spectroscopy is consistent with that used to explain Chiron&#x27;s long-term brightness variations.

Further evidence of the rings was provided by two independent observations of occultations on 28 November 2018 and 15 December 2022, which suggests that their structure is constantly evolving. In the 2018 event Chiron&#x27;s rings were observed to have less material than in 2011, but seemed to be developing a partial third ring; by the 2022 event there was more material than either of the previous observations, and the third ring had become fully developed. J.L. Ortiz speculated that the extra material in the 2022 event could be from an outburst observed in 2021, which left more material in orbit and thus bolstered the generation of the third ring–this is also expected to be cyclical, maintaining the rings.

The preferred pole of Chiron&#x27;s rings is, in ecliptic coordinates, &quot;λ&quot; = , &quot;β&quot; = . The rings&#x27; width, separation, and optical depths were observed to be nearly identical to those of Chariklo&#x27;s rings until the 2018 observation, indicating that the same type of structure had been responsible for both. Moreover, both their rings are within their respective Roche limits, though Chiron&#x27;s newly developed third ring may be outside of it depending on its density.

== Exploration ==
The &quot;Chiron Orbiter Mission&quot; was a mission proposed for NASA&#x27;s New Frontiers program or Flagship program. It was published in May 2010 and proposed an orbiter mission to Chiron. Its launch date could have varied from as early as 2023 to as late as 2025, depending on budget and propulsion type.

There was another mission proposed, part of the Discovery Program known as &quot;Centaurus&quot;; if approved, it would have launched between 2026 and 2029 and made a flyby of 2060 Chiron and one other Centaur sometime in the 2030s.

<doc id="53480" wikidata="Q389410" url="?curid=53480" title="Red dog (card game)">
<text>Red dog, also known as Yablon and Scottish Foghorn, is a game of chance played with cards, in which two cards are dealt and a player bets on whether the rank of a third card would fall between them. While found in some land casinos, its popularity has declined, although it is featured at many online casinos.

A standard 52-card deck is used. The game may be played with anywhere from one to eight decks, with an increasing number of decks decreasing the house&#x27;s edge—the house&#x27;s advantage begins at 3.155% with one deck but falls to 2.751% when eight decks are used. This is in contrast with some other casino card games, such as blackjack, where a higher number of decks used will increase the house edge.

A close variant is Acey Deucey.

== Red Dog ==

The game only uses three cards at a time, which are ranked as in poker, with aces high. Suit is irrelevant. A wager is placed, and two cards are placed face up on the table, with three possible outcomes:

*If the cards are consecutive in number (for example, a four and a five, or a jack and a queen), the hand is a push and the player&#x27;s wager is returned.
*If the two cards are of equal value, a third card is dealt. If the third card is of the same value, then the payout for the player is 11:1, otherwise, the hand is a push.
*If neither of the above is the case (for example, a three and an eight), then a spread is announced which determines the payoff (a 4-card spread, in this example), and a third card will be dealt. Before dealing the third card, the player has the option to double his bet. If the third card&#x27;s value falls between the first two, the player will receive a payoff according to the spread; otherwise, the bet is lost.

===Spread===
The spread table is as follows:

The house edge table is as follows.

The spread probabilities table is as follows.

== Acey Deucey ==
Acey Deucey, also known as In-Between, Sheets, Between the Sheets or Maverick, is a simple betting card game. Two cards are dealt to a player, who then bets on whether the rank of a third card will fall between those of the first two.

===Rules===
Before the action, each player must add their ante into the pot. Two cards are then dealt face-up to one player. That player then bets from nothing to the amount that is in the pot at the time whether or not the third card will numerically fall in between the first two. If the third card falls in between the two other cards, the bettor takes the amount they bet out of the pot; if the third card falls outside of the two other cards, the bettor must add what they bet to the pot; and if the third card matches the numerical value of one of the other two cards, the bettor must add to the pot double what they bet. If two cards of the same value come up, e.g. 2,2 the bettor picks if the next card will be higher or lower and bets. If the next card is the same as the last two, i.e. a 2, the bettor must triple their bet.

===Regionally specific rules===
The rules and specifics of the game often vary from region to region. For example in Liaoning province, northeast China the minimum number of players is 4 and each player is required to ante before the first card is turned. Two cards are then dealt face-up to one player. That player then bets from nothing to the amount that is in the pot at the time (during the first time around the table players are only allowed to bet up to half of the pot) whether or not the third card will numerically fall in between the first two. Other regions, such as in the United States, play the game by combining two decks of cards. This adds another dynamic to the game due to the extra number of similar type cards. Beyond that, most of the other rules followed by United States players are similar to those which are observed in the Liaoning province.

Just about all regions play if the third card falls in between the two other cards, the bettor takes the amount they bet out of the pot; if the third card falls outside of the two other cards, the bettor must add what they bet to the pot; and if the third card matches the numerical value of one of the other two cards, this is referred to as a &quot;Post&quot; and the bettor must add to the pot double their own initial bet. If two cards of the same value come up, e.g. 2,2 the bettor picks if the next card will be higher or lower and bets. If the next card is the same as the last two, i.e. a 2, this is considered a &quot;Post&quot; and the player is required to pay triple the bet for the hand.

===Aces===
In addition to this, there is a special rule for Aces. If the first card turned is an Ace the player may choose its value as either the high Ace or the low one. Low Ace is always lower than any other card, including the deuce. If an Ace comes up as the second card turned it is always considered the high Ace. If a player &quot;Posts&quot; on an Ace they are required to pay four times their bet for that hand. Aces also cause an automatic loss if it is the third card turned when the first two cards are a match, e.g. 6,6. The best spread in the game is considered to be a low Ace on the left and a high Ace on the right. This is also one of the worst hands to get as you run the risk of the third card being an Ace and having to pay four times your bet for the hand.

===Variations===
A variation is to split the cards if two end cards are the same value. This requires the bettor to ante in for two hands and the dealer would draw one more card under each of the end cards. After this, the same rules apply.

Some new rules that increase payouts and betting:
* Blind Pot - Bet the pot before your 2 outside cards are placed. In the case of a win, you win the pot. If you are outside of your cards you lose half the pot. If you post you have to pay the full amount of the pot.
* &quot;AutoPot&quot; - Any A-2 played as your outside cards automatically make the player bet the full amount of the pot.
* Post Bet - You can bet that your inside card will match one of your outside cards. In the case of this you win the full pot and in addition each player pays an equal percentage to match the pot. Therefore, the player that post would win 2x the pot. If the player bets the post and misses, they owe half the amount of the pot to the pot.
* Satan 6s - Any player that gets 6-6-6 as their cards must pay 6x the amount of the pot to the pot.

===In popular culture===

The game show &quot;Card Sharks&quot; is based on Acey Deucey and closely resembles the rules. In the show, two players answer high-low survey questions, and guess whether the next card is higher or lower (with duplicates counting as wrong).

Acey-deucey is often mentioned in the book series &quot;The Corps&quot; by W.E.B. Griffin, but that game is a table game, popular with the United States naval forces, and is not this game.

In 1978 a type-in program BASIC video game version was distributed via the book BASIC Computer Games.

An unsold 1985 game show pilot hosted by Jim McKrell, entitled &quot;Split Decision,&quot; had contestants playing the game Acey Deucey while answering general knowledge questions. Each player picked a card to share and had their own base card, and tried to fit a card in or bust the other player.

Red Dog is a playable casino minigame in the 1998 Game Boy game James Bond 007.

<doc id="53481" wikidata="Q3590573" url="?curid=53481" title="Game of chance">
<text>A game of chance is in contrast with a game of skill. It is a game whose outcome is strongly influenced by some randomizing device. Common devices used include dice, spinning tops, playing cards, roulette wheels, numbered balls, or in the case of digital games random number generators. A game of chance may be played as gambling if players wager money or anything of monetary value.

Alternatively, a game of skill is one in which the outcome is determined mainly by mental or physical skill, rather than chance.
While a game of chance may have some skill element to it, chance generally plays a greater role in determining its outcome. A game of skill may also may have elements of chance, but skill plays a greater role in determining its outcome.

Gambling is known in nearly all human societies, even though many have passed laws restricting it. Early people used the knucklebones of sheep as dice. Some people develop a psychological addiction to gambling and will risk food and shelter to continue.

== Skill ==
Some games that involve an element of luck may also require a certain level of skill. This is particularly evident when players need to make decisions based on prior knowledge or incomplete information, as seen in games like blackjack. In contrast, games such as roulette and &quot;punto banco&quot; (baccarat) rely more on chance, with players having the choice to determine their bet amount and selection, leaving the outcome largely to luck. Consequently, these games are categorized as games of chance, although a minimal skill component is still involved. 

The distinction between &#x27;chance&#x27; and &#x27;skill&#x27; is relevant because in some countries, chance games are illegal or at least regulated, but skill games are not. Since there is no standardized definition, poker, for example, has been ruled a game of chance in Germany and, by at least one New York state Federal judge, a game of skill.

== Addiction ==
People who engage in games of chance and gambling can develop a strong dependence on them. This is called psychopathology (addiction) of &quot;pathological gambling&quot;. According to psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler, there are six characteristics of pathological gamblers:
# They must play regularly: the issue here is to know when the subject performs &quot;too much&quot;.
# The game takes precedence over all other interests.
# There is optimism in the player that is not initiated by repeated experiences of failure.
# The player never stops until they win.
# Despite the precautions that they originally promised, they end up taking too many risks.
# There is in them a subjective experience of &quot;thrill&quot; (a shivering sensation, excitement, tension, both painful and pleasant) during the phases of play.

== State revenues ==
Governments that authorize games of chance generate significant gambling revenues. 

According to the UK Gambling Commission, the government received a total gross gambling revenue of £144 billion ($19 billion) in 2018. That was up 45% from a year earlier. 

The Gambling Commission is an executive non-departmental body of the UK government. It is responsible for regulating gambling in the UK. It also oversees gambling legislation. 

The state government of Nevada, USA, received gambling revenues totaling $262 billion in 2017. Casino contributions totaled $8522 million, 77% of the total, according to iGaming Business.

== Types ==
There are dozens of different types of games of chance. The most popular online casino games are video poker, roulette, craps, blackjack and sports betting. Baccarat is also popular. 

*Casinos - they exist online as well as in physical buildings that people go into (in real life). 
*Arcades - which may be intended exclusively for persons over the age of 18 or families. 
*Bingo - which can be held in a bingo hall or online. 
*Betting - which can be conducted online, in betting shops (sweepstakes) or at the event. 
*Slot machines - such as fruit machines or fixed odds betting terminals.

<doc id="53483" wikidata="Q2141342" url="?curid=53483" title="Languages constructed by Tolkien">
<text>The English philologist and author J. R. R. Tolkien created several constructed languages, mostly related to his fictional world of Middle-earth. Inventing languages, something that he called &quot;glossopoeia&quot; (paralleling his idea of &quot;mythopoeia&quot; or myth-making), was a lifelong occupation for Tolkien, starting in his teens.

Tolkien&#x27;s glossopoeia has two temporal dimensions: the internal (fictional) timeline of events in Middle-earth described in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and other writings, and the external timeline of Tolkien&#x27;s own life during which he often revised and refined his languages and their fictional history. Tolkien scholars have published a substantial volume of Tolkien&#x27;s linguistic material in the &quot;History of Middle-earth&quot; books, and the &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; and &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; journals. Scholars such as Carl F. Hostetter, David Salo and Elizabeth Solopova have published grammars and studies of the languages. 

He created a large family of Elvish languages, the best-known and most developed being Quenya and Sindarin. In addition, he sketched in the Mannish languages of Adûnaic and Rohirric; the Dwarvish language of Khuzdul; the Entish language; and the Black Speech, in the fiction a constructed language enforced on the Orcs by the Dark Lord Sauron. Tolkien supplemented his languages with several scripts.

== Context ==

=== Tolkien&#x27;s hobby: glossopoeia ===

Tolkien was a professional philologist of ancient Germanic languages, specialising in Old English. Glossopoeia, the construction of languages, was Tolkien&#x27;s hobby for most of his life. At a little over 13, he helped construct a sound substitution cypher known as &quot;Nevbosh&quot;, &#x27;new nonsense&#x27;, which grew to include some elements of actual invented language. Tolkien stated that this was not his first effort in invented languages. Shortly thereafter, he developed a true invented language called Naffarin. One of his early projects was the reconstruction of an unrecorded early Germanic language which might have been spoken by the people of &quot;Beowulf&quot; in the Germanic Heroic Age.

In 1931, Tolkien gave a lecture about his passion for constructed languages, titled &quot;A Secret Vice&quot;. Here he contrasts his project of artistic languages constructed for aesthetic pleasure with the pragmatism of international auxiliary languages. The lecture also discusses Tolkien&#x27;s views on phonaesthetics, citing Greek, Finnish, and Welsh as examples of &quot;languages which have a very characteristic and in their different ways beautiful word-form&quot;. Part of the lecture was published in &quot;The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays&quot;; in the part that was not, Tolkien gave the example of &quot;Fonwegian&quot;, a language with &quot;no connection whatever with any other known language&quot;. 

Being a skilled calligrapher, Tolkien invented scripts for his languages. The scripts included Sarati, Cirth, and Tengwar.

=== Tolkien&#x27;s theory of invented languages ===

Tolkien was of the opinion that the invention of an artistic language in order to be convincing and pleasing must include not only the language&#x27;s historical development, but also the history of its speakers, and especially the mythology associated with both the language and the speakers. It was this idea that an &quot;Elvish language&quot; must be associated with a complex history and mythology of the Elves that was at the core of the development of Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium.

Tolkien wrote in one of his letters:

The Tolkien scholar and folklorist Dimitra Fimi questions this claim. In particular, his September 1914 &quot;The Voyage of Earendel the Evening Star&quot;, based on the Old English poem Crist 1, shows that he was starting to think about a mythology before he started to sketch his first invented Middle-earth language, Qenya, in March 1915. Further, the steps that led to his first attempt at the mythology, the 1917 draft of &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, involving the character of Earendel in its first story, did not involve his invented languages. Tolkien was, rather, in Fimi&#x27;s view, emphasizing that language and myth &quot;began to flow together when I was an undergraduate [at Oxford, 1911–1915]&quot; (as Tolkien wrote in 1954), and stayed that way for the rest of his life.

=== &quot;Lhammas&quot; ===

In 1937, Tolkien wrote the &quot;Lhammas&quot;, a linguistic treatise addressing the relationships of the languages spoken in Middle-earth during the First Age, principally the Elvish languages. The text purports to be a translation of an Elvish work, written by one Pengolodh, whose historical works are presented as being the main source of the narratives in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; concerning the First Age.

The &quot;Lhammas&quot; exists in three versions, the shortest one being called the &quot;Lammasathen&quot;. The main linguistic thesis in this text is that the languages of Middle-earth are all descended from the language of the Valar (the &quot;gods&quot;), Valarin, and divided into three branches:

* Oromëan, named after Oromë, who taught the first Elves to speak. All languages of Elves and most languages of Men are Oromëan.
* Aulëan, named after Aulë, maker of the Dwarves, is the origin of the Khuzdul language. It has had some influences on the tongues of Men.
* Melkian, named after the rebellious Melkor or Morgoth, is the origin in the First Age of the many tongues used by the Orcs and other evil beings.

== Middle-earth languages ==

=== Elvish languages ===

==== Internal and external histories ====

Internally, in the fiction, the Elvish language family is a group of languages related by descent from a common ancestor, called the proto-language.

Externally, in Tolkien&#x27;s life, he constructed the family from around 1910, working on it up to his death in 1973. He constructed the grammar and vocabulary of at least fifteen languages and dialects in roughly three periods:

# Early, 1910 – : most of the proto-language Primitive Quendian, Common Eldarin, Quenya, and Goldogrin
# Mid: : Goldogrin changed into Noldorin, joined by Telerin, Ilkorin, Doriathrin and Avarin
# Late: Ilkorin and Doriathrin disappeared; Noldorin matured into Sindarin.

Tolkien worked out much of the etymological background of his Elvish languages during the 1930s, resulting in &quot;The Etymologies&quot;.

==== Quenya ====

Tolkien based Quenya pronunciation more on Latin than on Finnish, though it has elements derived from both languages. Thus, Quenya lacks the vowel harmony and consonant gradation present in Finnish, and accent is not always on the first syllable of a word. Typical Finnish elements like the front vowels &quot;ö&quot;, &quot;ä&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are lacking in Quenya, but phonological similarities include the absence of aspirated unvoiced stops or the development of the syllables &quot;ti&quot; &gt; &quot;si&quot; in both languages. The combination of a Latin basis with Finnish phonological rules resulted in a product that resembles Italian in many respects, which was Tolkien&#x27;s favourite modern Romance language.

Quenya grammar is agglutinative and mostly suffixing, i.e. different word particles are joined by appending them. It has basic word classes of verbs, nouns and pronouns/determiners, adjectives and prepositions. Nouns are inflected for case and number. Verbs are inflected for tense and aspect, and for agreement with subject and object. In early Quenya, adjectives agree with the noun they modify in case and number; in later Quenya, this agreement disappears. The basic word order is subject–verb–object.

==== Sindarin ====

Tolkien wrote that he gave Sindarin &quot;a linguistic character very like (though not identical with) British-Welsh ... because it seems to fit the rather &#x27;Celtic&#x27; type of legends and stories told of its speakers&quot;.

Unlike Quenya, Sindarin is mainly a fusional language with some analytic tendencies. It can be distinguished from Quenya by the rarity of vowel endings, and the use of voiced plosives &quot;b d g&quot;, rare in Quenya found only after nasals and liquids. Early Sindarin formed plurals by the addition of &quot;-ī&quot;, which vanished but affected the preceding vowels (as in Welsh and Old English): S. , pl. , S. , pl. &quot;Yrch&quot;. Sindarin forms plurals in multiple ways.

=== Mannish languages ===

==== Adûnaic ====

Tolkien devised Adûnaic (or Númenórean), the language spoken in Númenor, shortly after World War II, and thus at about the time he completed &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but before he wrote the linguistic background of the Appendices. Adûnaic is intended as the language from which Westron (also called &quot;Adûni&quot;) is derived. This added a depth of historical development to the Mannish languages. Adûnaic was intended to have a &quot;faintly Semitic flavour&quot;. Its development began with &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; (written in 1945). It is there that the most extensive sample of the language is found, revealed to one of the (modern-day) protagonists, Lowdham, of that story in a visionary dream of Atlantis. Its grammar is sketched in the unfinished &quot;Lowdham&#x27;s Report on the Adunaic Language&quot;.
Tolkien remained undecided whether the language of the Men of Númenor should be derived from the original Mannish language (as in Adûnaic), or if it should be derived from &quot;the Elvish Noldorin&quot; (i.e. Quenya) instead. In &quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot;, it is implied that the Númenóreans spoke Quenya, and that Sauron, hating all things Elvish, taught the Númenóreans the old Mannish tongue they themselves had forgotten.

==== Rohirric ====

Tolkien called the language of Rohan &quot;Rohanese&quot;. He only gave a few actual Rohirric words:

*&quot;Kûd-dûkan&quot;, an old word meaning &quot;hole-dweller&quot;, which evolved to &quot;kuduk&quot;, the name the Hobbits had for themselves
*&quot;Lô-&quot; / &quot;loh-&quot; corresponding to Old English &quot;éoh&quot;, &quot;war-horse&quot;, and the derived names &quot;Lôgrad&quot; for &quot;Horse-Mark&quot;, and &quot;Lohtûr&quot; for &quot;Éothéod&quot;, &quot;horse-people&quot;. This word is an exact homonym of the Hungarian word for &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;ló&quot;. The Rohirric word for &quot;horse&quot; has been identified as a cognate for Tolkien&#x27;s Elvish words for &quot;horse&quot;: &quot;rocco&quot; (Quenya) and &quot;roch&quot; (Sindarin). All names beginning with &quot;Éo-&quot; supposedly represent Rohirric names beginning with &quot;Lô-&quot; or &quot;Loh-&quot;, but the Rohirric forms of names such as &quot;Éomer&quot; and &quot;Éowyn&quot; are not given.

Only one proper name is given, &quot;Tûrac&quot;, an old word for King, the Rohirric for Théoden. That in turn is the Old English word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;leader of a people&quot;, &quot;king&quot; or &quot;prince&quot;. As with other descriptive names in his legendarium, Tolkien uses this name to create the impression that the text is &quot;&#x27;historical&#x27;, &#x27;real&#x27; or &#x27;archaic&#x27;&quot;.

=== Dwarvish ===

Some samples of Khuzdul, the language of the Dwarves, are given in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The explanation here is a little different from the &quot;Mannish&quot; languages: as &quot;Khuzdul&quot; was supposedly kept secret by the Dwarves and never used in the presence of outsiders (not even Dwarvish given names), it was not &quot;translated&quot; by any real-life historical language, and such limited examples as there are in the text are given in the &quot;original&quot;. 
Khuzdul was designed to resemble a Semitic language, with a system of triconsonantal roots and other parallels especially to Hebrew, just as some resemblances between the Dwarves and the Jews are intentional.

=== Entish ===

The language of the Ents is briefly described in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. As the Ents were first taught to speak by Elves, Entish appears related to the Elvish languages. However, the Ents continued to develop their language. It is described as long and sonorous, a tonal language somewhat like a woodwind instrument. Only the Ents spoke Entish as no others could master it. Even the Elves, master linguists, could not learn Entish, nor did they attempt to record it because of its complex sound structure:

To illustrate these properties, Tolkien provides the word &quot;a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lindor-burúme&quot;, meaning &quot;hill&quot;. He described it as a &quot;probably very inaccurate&quot; sampling of the language.

=== Black Speech ===

Tolkien devised little of the Black Speech beyond the Rhyme of the Rings. He intentionally made it sound harsh but with a proper grammar. He stated that it was an agglutinative language; it has been likened to the extinct Hurrian language of northern Mesopotamia. 

In the fiction, the Black Speech was created by the Dark Lord Sauron to be the official language of all the lands and peoples under his control: it was thus both in reality and in the fiction a constructed language. The Orcs are said never to have accepted it willingly; the language mutated into many mutually unintelligible Orkish dialects, so that Orcs communicated with each other mainly in a debased Westron.

== Analysis ==

=== Origins ===

Tolkien developed a particular love for the Finnish language. He described the finding of a Finnish grammar book as &quot;like discovering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before&quot;. Finnish morphology, particularly its rich system of inflection, in part gave rise to Quenya. 
Another of Tolkien&#x27;s favourites was Welsh, and features of Welsh phonology found their way into Sindarin.

=== Linguistic mapping ===

When writing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–55), a sequel to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937), Tolkien came up with the literary device of using real languages to &quot;translate&quot; fictional languages. He pretended to have translated the original language Westron (named &quot;Adûni&quot; in Westron) or Common Speech (&quot;Sôval Phârë&quot;, in Westron) into English. This device of rendering an &quot;imaginary&quot; language with a &quot;real&quot; one was carried further by rendering:

* Rohirric, the language of Rohan (related to Westron) by the Mercian dialect of Old English
* names in the tongue of Dale by Old Norse forms
* names of the Kingdom of Rhovanion by Gothic forms, thus mapping the genetic relation of his fictional languages on to the existing historical relations of the Germanic languages.

Furthermore, to parallel the Celtic substratum in England, he used Old Welsh names to render the Dunlendish names of Buckland Hobbits (e.g., &quot;Meriadoc&quot; for &quot;Kalimac&quot;). The whole device of linguistic mapping was essentially a fix for the problems Tolkien had created for himself by using real Norse names for the Dwarves in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, rather than inventing new names in Khuzdul. This seemed a clever solution, as it allowed him to explain the book&#x27;s use of Modern English as representing Westron. 
Because of this, Tolkien did not need to work out the details of Westron grammar or vocabulary in any detail. He does give some examples of Westron words in Appendix F to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, where he summarizes Westron&#x27;s origin and role as &quot;lingua franca&quot; in Middle-earth:

Rohirric is represented in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by Old English because Tolkien chose to make the relationship between Rohirric and the Common Speech similar to that of Old English and Modern English.

Tolkien stated in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; that the name Orthanc had &quot;by design or chance&quot; two meanings. In Sindarin it meant &quot;Mount Fang&quot;, while in the language of Rohan he said it meant &quot;Cunning Mind&quot;. The author Robert Foster notes that &quot;orþanc&quot; genuinely does mean &quot;cunning&quot; in Old English, so that the homonym Tolkien had in mind was between Sindarin and Old English, that is, translated or represented Rohirric. Foster comments that since it would be unlikely for a homonym also to exist between these two languages and actual Rohirric, and for the Old English and the Rohirric to be synonyms as well, Tolkien had made an error.

== Study ==

The first published monograph dedicated to the Elvish languages was &quot;An Introduction to Elvish&quot; (1978) edited by Jim Allan (published by Bran&#x27;s Head Books). It is composed of articles written before the publication of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. Ruth Noel wrote a book on Middle-earth&#x27;s languages in 1980.

With the publication of much linguistic material during the 1990s, especially in the &quot;History of Middle-earth&quot; series, and the &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot; and &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; material published during the early 2000s from among the 3000 pages of linguistic material held by the team of editors including Carl F. Hostetter, Tolkien&#x27;s constructed languages have become much more accessible.

David Salo&#x27;s 2007 &quot;A Gateway to Sindarin&quot; presents Sindarin&#x27;s grammar concisely. Elizabeth Solopova&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Languages, Myth and History&quot; gives an overview of the linguistic traits of the various languages invented by Tolkien and the history of their creation.

A few fanzines were dedicated to the subject, like &quot;Tyalië Tyelelliéva&quot; published by Lisa Star, and &quot;Quettar&quot;, the Bulletin of the Linguistic Fellowship of The Tolkien Society, published by Julian C. Bradfield. &quot;Tengwestië&quot; is an online publication of the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship.
Internet mailing lists and forums that have been dedicated to Tolkien&#x27;s constructed languages include Tolklang, Elfling and Lambengolmor. Since 2005, there has been an International Conference on J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s Invented Languages.

<text>The narwhal (Monodon monoceros) is a species of toothed whale native to the Arctic. It is the only member of the genus Monodon and one of two living representatives of the family Monodontidae. The narwhal is a stocky cetacean with a relatively blunt snout, a large melon, and a shallow ridge in place of a dorsal fin. Males of this species have a large () long tusk, which is a protruding left canine thought to function as a weapon, a tool for feeding, in attracting mates or sensing water salinity. Specially adapted slow-twitch muscles, along with the jointed neck vertebrae and shallow dorsal ridge allow for easy movement through the Arctic environment, where the narwhal spends extended periods at great depths. The narwhal&#x27;s geographic range overlaps with that of the similarly built and closely related beluga whale, and the animals are known to interbreed.

Narwhals inhabits the Arctic waters of Canada, Greenland and Russia. Every year, they migrate to ice-free summering grounds, usually in shallow waters, and often return to the same sites in subsequent years. Their diet mainly consists of polar and Arctic cod, Greenland halibut, cuttlefish, shrimp, and armhook squid. Diving to depths of up to , the narwhal is among the deepest-diving cetaceans. The animals typically travel in groups of three to eight, with aggregations of up to 1,000 occurring in the summer months. Narwhals mate among the offshore pack ice from March to May, and the young are born between July and August of the following year. When communicating amongst themselves, narwhals use a variety of clicks, whistles and knocks.

There are an estimated 170,000 living narwhals, and the species is listed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The population is threatened by the effects of climate change, such as reduction in ice cover and human activities such as pollution and hunting. Narwhals have been hunted for thousands of years by Inuit in northern Canada and Greenland for meat and ivory, and regulated subsistence hunting continues to this day.

== Taxonomy ==

The narwhal was scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The word &quot;narwhal&quot; comes from the Old Norse , meaning &#x27;corpse-whale&#x27;, which possibly refers to the animal&#x27;s grey, mottled skin and its habit of remaining motionless when at the water&#x27;s surface, a behaviour known as &quot;logging&quot; that usually happens in the summer. The scientific name, &quot;Monodon monoceros&quot;, is derived from Ancient Greek, meaning &#x27;single-tooth single-horn&#x27;.

The narwhal is most closely related to the beluga whale (&quot;Delphinapterus leucas&quot;). Together, these two species comprise the only extant members of the family Monodontidae, sometimes referred to as the &quot;white whales&quot;. Monodontids are distinguished by their pronounced melons (acoustic sensory organs), short snouts and the absence of a true dorsal fin.

Although the narwhal and beluga are classified as separate genera, there is some evidence of interbreeding between the two. Most prominent are the remains of a whale, described by marine zoologists as unlike any known species, which were found in West Greenland around 1990. It had features midway between a narwhal and a beluga, indicating that the remains belonged to a hybrid between the two species (a &#x27;narluga&#x27;); this was confirmed by a 2019 DNA analysis. Whether the hybrid itself could breed remains unknown.

=== Evolution ===

Results of a genetic study reveal that porpoises and monodontids are closely related, forming a separate clade which diverged from other dolphins about 11 million years ago (mya). A 2018 molecular analysis of monodontid fossils indicates that they separated from Phocoenidae (porpoises) around 10.82 to 20.12 mya, and they are considered to be sister taxa. A later phylogenetic study conducted in 2020 suggested that the narwhal split from the beluga whale around 4.98 mya, based on data from mitochondrial DNA.

The fossil species &quot;Casatia thermophila&quot; of early Pliocene central Italy was described as a possible narwhal ancestor when it was discovered in 2019. &quot;Bohaskaia&quot;, &quot;Denebola&quot; and &quot;Haborodelphis&quot; are other extinct genera known from the Pliocene of the United States. Fossil evidence shows that prehistoric monodontids lived in tropical waters. They may have migrated to Arctic and subarctic waters in response to changes in the marine food chain.

The following phylogenetic tree is based on a 2019 study of the family Monodontidae.

== Description ==
The narwhal has a robust body with a short, blunt snout, small upcurved flippers, and convex to concave tail flukes. Adults measure in length and weigh . Male narwhals attain sexual maturity at 12 to 20 years of age, reaching a length of . Females reach sexual maturity at a younger age, between 8 and 9 years old, when they are about long. On average, males are about longer and more than 75% heavier than females.

The colouration of the narwhal consists of a mottled pattern, with blackish-brown markings over a white background. At birth, the skin is light grey, and when sexually mature, white patches grow on the navel and genital slit; such whitening occurs throughout life, resulting in aged narwhals being almost purely white. Unlike most whales, the narwhal has a shallow dorsal ridge, rather than a dorsal fin, possibly an evolutionary adaptation to make swimming under ice easier or to facilitate rolling. The neck vertebrae are also jointed, instead of being fused as in most whales, which allows for a greater range of neck flexibility. These characteristics are shared by the beluga whale. Furthermore, male and female narwhals have differently shaped tail flukes; the former are bent inward, while the latter are swept back on the front margins. This is thought to be an adaptation for reducing drag caused by the tusk.

The skeletal muscles of narwhals are highly adapted for prolonged periods of deep-sea foraging. During such activities, oxygen is reserved in the muscles, which are typically slow-twitch, enabling greater endurance and manouverability. Narwhals also have a comparatively high amount of myoglobin in their body, which helps to facilitate deeper dives. It has a dense layer of blubber, around thick. This fat accounts for a third of the body mass and helps insulate from cold ocean temperatures.

=== Tusk and dentition ===
The most conspicuous trait of male narwhals is a long, spiralled tusk, which is a canine tooth that projects from the left side of the upper jaw. Both sexes have a pair of tusks embedded in the upper jaw, which in males erupt from the lip somewhere between two and three years of age. The tusk grows throughout the animal&#x27;s life, reaching lengths of . It is hollow and weighs up to . Some males may grow two tusks, occurring when the right canine also protrudes through the lip. Females rarely grow tusks: when they do, the tusks are typically smaller than those of males, with less noticeable spirals.

Current scientific consensus indicates that narwhal tusks are secondary sexual characteristics which indicate social status. Further functions of the narwhal tusk are debated: while some biologists suggest that narwhals use their tusks in fights, others argue that they may be of use in feeding. The tusk is also a highly innervated sensory organ with millions of nerve endings, allowing the narwhal to sense temperature variability in its surroundings. These nerves may also be able to detect changes in particle concentration and water pressure. According to Dr. Martin Nweeia, male narwhals may rid themselves of encrustations on their tusks by rubbing them together, as opposed to posturing displays of aggressive male-to-male rivalry. Drone footage from August 2016 in Tremblay Sound, Nunavut, revealed that narwhals used their tusks to tap and small Arctic cod, making them easier to catch for feeding. Females, who usually do not have tusks, live longer than males, hence the tusk cannot be essential to the animal&#x27;s survival. It is generally accepted that the primary function of the narwhal tusk is associated with sexual selection.

Alongside its tusk, the narwhal has a single pair of small vestigial teeth that reside in open tooth sockets in the upper jaw. These teeth, which differ in form and composition, encircle the exposed tooth sockets laterally, posteriorly, and ventrally. Vestigial teeth in male narwhals are commonly shed in the palate. The varied morphology and anatomy of small teeth indicate a path of evolutionary obsolescence.

== Distribution ==

The narwhal is found in the Atlantic and Russian areas of the Arctic Ocean. Individuals are commonly recorded in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, such as in the northern part of Hudson Bay, in Hudson Strait, in Baffin Bay, off the east coast of Greenland and in a strip running east from the northern end of Greenland to eastern Russia (170° east). Land in this strip includes Svalbard, Franz Joseph Land and Severnaya Zemlya. The northernmost sightings of narwhals occurred north of Franz Joseph Land, at about 85° north. There are an estimated 12,500 narwhals in the northern Hudson Bay, whereas around 140,000 reside in Baffin Bay.

=== Migration ===
Narwhals exhibit seasonal migration, with a high fidelity of return to preferred ice-free summering grounds, usually in shallow waters. In summer months, they move closer to the coast, often in pods of 10–100 individuals. In the winter, they move to deeper waters offshore, under thick pack ice, surfacing in narrow fissures or in wider fractures known as leads. As spring comes, these leads open up into channels and the narwhals return to the coastal bays. Narwhals in Baffin Bay typically travel to northern Canada and Greenland between June and September. After this period, they travel about south to the Davis Strait, and stay there until April. During winter, narwhals from Canada and West Greenland regularly visit the pack ice of the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay along the continental slope which contains less than 5% open water and hosts a high density of Greenland halibut.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Narwhals normally congregate in groups of three to eight individuals. Groups may be &quot;nurseries&quot; with only females and young, or can contain only juveniles or adult males (&quot;bulls&quot;); mixed groups can occur at any time of year. In the summer, several groups come together, forming larger aggregations which can contain 500 to over 1,000 individuals. Male narwhals have been observed rubbing each other&#x27;s tusks, a behaviour known as &quot;tusking&quot;.

When in their wintering waters, narwhals make some of the deepest dives recorded for cetaceans, diving to at least over 15 times per day, with many dives reaching . The greatest dive depth recorded is . Dives last up to 25 minutes, and vary in depth depending on the season and local variation between environments. For example, in the Baffin Bay wintering grounds, narwhals tend to dive deep within the steep coasts, typically south of Baffin Bay. This suggests differences in habitat structure, prey availability, or genetic adaptations between subpopulations. In the northern wintering grounds, narwhals do not dive as deep as the southern population, in spite of greater water depths in these areas. This is mainly attributed to prey being concentrated nearer to the surface, which causes narwhals to alter their foraging strategies.

=== Diet ===
Narwhals have a restricted and specialised diet. Due to the lack of well-developed dentition, narwhals are believed to feed by swimming close to prey and sucking them into the mouth. A study of the stomach contents of 73 narwhals found Arctic cod (&quot;Boreogadus saida&quot;) to be the most commonly consumed prey, followed by Greenland halibut (&quot;Reinhardtius hippoglossoides&quot;). Large quantities of Boreo-Atlantic armhook squid (&quot;Gonatus fabricii&quot;) were also discovered. Male specimens had a higher likelihood of showing two additional prey species within their stomach contents: polar cod (&quot;Arctogadus glacialis&quot;) and redfish (&quot;Sebastes marinus&quot;), both of which are found at depths of more than . The study also concluded that the size of prey did not differ between genders or age groups. Other items found within narwhal stomach contents include wolffish, capelin, skate eggs and sometimes rocks.

Narwhal diet varies between seasons. In winter, narwhals feed on demersal prey, mostly flatfish, under dense pack ice. During the summer, they eat mostly Arctic cod and Greenland halibut, with other fish such as polar cod making up the remainder of their diet. Narwhals consume more food in the winter months than they do in summer.

=== Breeding ===

Most female narwhals reproduce by the time they are six to eight years old. Courtship and mating behaviour for the species has been recorded from March to May, when they live among offshore pack ice, and is thought to involve a dominant male mating with several partners. The average gestation period lasts 15 months, and births appear to be most frequent between July and August. Female narwhals have a birth interval of around 2–3 years. As with most marine mammals, only a single calf is born, averaging in length with white or light grey pigmentation. Summer population surveys along different coastal inlets of Baffin Island found that calf numbers varied from 0.05% of 35,000 in Admiralty Inlet, to 5% of 10,000 total in Eclipse Sound. These findings suggest that higher calf counts may reflect calving and nursery habitats in favourable inlets.

Newborn calves begin their lives with a thin layer of blubber. The blubber thickens as they nurse their mother&#x27;s milk, which is rich in fat; calves are dependent on milk for about 20 months. This long lactation period gives calves time to learn the skills they will need to survive as they mature. Narwhals are among the few animals that undergo menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding. Females in this phase may continue to protect calves in the pod. A 2024 study concluded that five species of toothed whale evolved menopause to acquire higher overall longevity, although their reproductive periods did not change. To explain this, scientists hypothesised that calves of these species require the assistance of (post-)menopausal females for an enhanced chance at survival, as they are extremely difficult for a single female to successfully rear.

=== Communication ===

Like most toothed whales, narwhals use sound to navigate and hunt for food. They primarily vocalise through clicks, whistles and knocks, created by air movement between chambers near the blowhole. The frequency of these sounds ranges from 0.3 to 125 hertz, while those used for echolocation typically fall between 19 and 48 hertz. Sounds are reflected off the sloping front of the skull and focused by the animal&#x27;s melon: a mass of fat which can be controlled through surrounding musculature. Echolocation clicks are used for detecting prey and locating barriers at short distances. Whistles and throbs are most commonly used to communicate with other pod members. Calls recorded from the same pod are more similar than calls from different pods, suggesting the possibility of group- or individual-specific calls. Narwhals sometimes adjust the duration and pitch of their pulsed calls to maximise sound propagation in varying acoustic environments. Other sounds produced by narwhals include trumpeting and &quot;squeaking-door sounds&quot;. The narwhal vocal repertoire is similar to that of the beluga whale. However, the frequency ranges, durations, and repetition rates of narwhal clicks differ from those of belugas.

=== Longevity and mortality factors ===

Age determination techniques using the number of periosteum layers in the lower jaw reveal that narwhals live an average of 50 years, though techniques using amino acid dating from the lens of the eyes suggest that female narwhals can reach 115±10 years and male narwhals can live to 84±9 years.

Death by suffocation often occurs when narwhals fail to migrate before the Arctic freezes over in late autumn. This is known as &quot;sea-ice entrapment&quot;. Narwhals drown if open water is no longer accessible and ice is too thick for them to break through. Breathing holes in ice may be up to apart, which limits the use of foraging grounds. These holes must be at least wide to allow an adult whale to breathe. Narwhals also die of starvation from entrapment events.

In 19141915, around 1,000 narwhal carcasses were discovered after entrapment events, most occurring in areas such as Disko Bay in West Greenland. Several cases of sea entrapment were recorded in 2008–2010, during the Arctic winter, including in some places where such events had never been recorded before. This suggests later departure dates from summering grounds. Wind and currents move sea ice from adjacent locations to Greenland, leading to fluctuations in concentration. Due to their tendency of returning to the same areas, changes in weather and ice conditions are not always associated with narwhal movement toward open water. It is currently unclear to what extent sea ice changes pose a danger to narwhals.

Narwhals are preyed upon by polar bears and orcas. In some instances, the former have been recorded waiting at breathing holes for young narwhals, while the latter were observed surrounding and killing entire narwhal pods. To escape predators such as orcas, narwhals may use prolonged submersion to hide under ice floes rather than relying on speed.

Researchers found bacteria of the &quot;Brucella&quot; genus in the bloodstreams of numerous narwhals throughout the course of a 19-year study. They were also recorded with whale lice species such as &quot;Cyamus monodontis&quot; and &quot;Cyamus nodosus&quot;. Other pathogens that affect narwhals include &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, morbillivirus, and papillomavirus. In 2018, a female narwhal was recorded with an alphaherpesvirus in her system.

== Conservation ==
The narwhal is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List. As of 2017, the global population is estimated to be 123,000 mature individuals out of a total of 170,000. There were about 12,000 narwhals in Northern Hudson Bay in 2011, and around 49,000 near Somerset Island in 2013. There are approximately 35,000 in Admiralty Inlet, 10,000 in Eclipse Sound, 17,000 in Eastern Baffin Bay, and 12,000 in Jones Sound. Population numbers in Smith Sound, Inglefield Bredning and Melville Bay are 16,000, 8,000 and 3,000, respectively. There are roughly 800 narwhals in the waters off Svalbard.

In the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, the United States banned imports of products made from narwhal parts. They are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). These committees restrict international trading of live animals and their body parts, as well as implementing sustainable action plans. The species is classified as special concern under the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), which aims to classify the risk levels of species in the country.

In 2025 the United Kingdom protected narwhals under the Ivory Act, which forbids trade in teeth and tusks except for &quot;artistic and cultural artifacts.&quot;

=== Threats ===

Narwhals are hunted for their skin, meat, teeth, tusks and carved vertebrae, which are commercially traded. About 1,000 narwhals are killed per year: 600 in Canada and 400 in Greenland. Canadian catches were steady at this level in the 1970s, dropped to 300–400 per year in the late 1980s and 1990s and have risen again since 1999. Greenland caught more, 700–900 per year, in the 1980s and 1990s.

In Canada and Greenland, Narwhal tusks are sold both carved and uncarved. Per hunted narwhal, an average of one to two vertebrae and teeth are sold. In Greenland, the skin () is sold commercially to fish factories, and in Canada to other communities. Based on an analysis of 2007 narwhal hunts in Hudson Bay, a 2013 paper estimated that gross revenue per narwhal was (US$). Hunts receive subsidies, but they continue mainly to support tradition, rather than for profit. Economic analysis noted that whale watching may be an alternate source of revenue.

As narwhals grow, bioaccumulation of heavy metals takes place within their bodies. It is thought that pollution in the ocean is the primary cause of bioaccumulation in marine mammals; this may lead to health problems for the narwhal population. When bioaccumulating, numerous metals appear in the blubber, liver, kidney and musculature. A study found that the blubber was nearly devoid of these metals, whereas the liver and kidneys had a dense concentration of them. Relative to the liver, the kidney has a greater concentration of zinc and cadmium, while lead, copper and mercury were not nearly as abundant. Individuals of different weight and sex showed differences in the concentration of metals in their organs.

Narwhals are one of the Arctic marine mammals most vulnerable to climate change due to sea ice decline, especially in their northern wintering grounds such as the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait regions. Satellite data collected from these areas shows the amount of sea ice has been markedly reduced from what it was previously. It is thought that narwhals&#x27; foraging ranges reflect patterns they acquired early in life, which improves their capacity to obtain the food supplies they need for the winter. This strategy focuses on strong site fidelity rather than individual-level responses to local prey distribution, resulting in focal foraging areas during the winter. As such, despite changing conditions, narwhals will continue to return to the same areas during migration.

Reduction in sea ice has possibly led to an increased exposure to predation. In 2002, hunters in Siorapaluk experienced an increase in the number of caught narwhals, but this increase did not seem to be linked to enhanced endeavour, implying that climate change may be making the narwhal more vulnerable to hunting. Scientists recommend assessing population numbers, assigning sustainable quotas, and ensuring local acceptance of sustainable development. Seismic surveys associated with oil exploration disrupt the narwhal&#x27;s normal migration patterns. These disturbed migrations may also be associated with increased sea ice entrapment.

== Relationship with humans ==

Narwhals have coexisted alongside circumpolar peoples for millennia. Their long, distinctive tusks were often held with fascination throughout human history. These tusks were prized for their supposed healing powers, and were worn on staffs and thrones. Depictions of narwhals in paintings such as &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; have found a prevalent place in human arts.

=== Inuit ===

Narwhals have been hunted by Inuit to the same extent as other sea mammals, such as seals and whales. Almost all parts of the narwhalthe meat, skin, blubber and organsare consumed. , the raw skin and attached blubber, is considered a delicacy. As a custom, one or two vertebrae per animal are used for tools and art. The skin is an important source of vitamin C, which is otherwise difficult to obtain in the Arctic Circle. In some places in Greenland, such as Qaanaaq, traditional hunting methods are used and whales are harpooned from handmade kayaks. In other parts of Greenland and Northern Canada, high-speed boats and hunting rifles are used.

In Inuit legend, the narwhal&#x27;s tusk was created when a woman with harpoon rope tied around her waist was dragged into the ocean after the harpoon had stuck into a large narwhal. She was then transformed into a narwhal; her hair, which she was wearing in a twisted knot, became the spiralling narwhal tusk.

=== Tusk trade ===

In Europe, narwhal tusks were highly sought-after for centuries. This stems from a medieval belief that narwhal tusks were the horns of the legendary unicorn. Considered to have magical properties, narwhal tusks were used to counter poisoning, and all sorts of diseases such as measles and rubella. The rise of modern science towards the end of the 17th century led to a decreased belief in magic and alchemy. After the unicorn notion was scientifically refuted, narwhal tusks were rarely employed for magical purposes.

According to some theories, Vikings and Greenland Norse began trade of narwhal tusks, which, via European channels, would later reach markets in the Middle East and East Asia. The idea that Norsemen hunted narwhals was once held, but was never confirmed and is now considered improbable. Narwhal tusks were given as state gifts to kings and queens throughout medieval Europe, with the price of narwhal tusks said to have been a couple of hundred times greater than their weight in gold during the 18th and 19th centuries. Ivan the Terrible had a jewellery-covered narwhal tusk on his deathbed, while Elizabeth I received a narwhal tusk allegedly valued at £10,000 pounds sterling from the privateer Martin Frobisher. Both items were staples in cabinets of curiosities.

<doc id="53486" wikidata="Q130549" url="?curid=53486" title="Tracey Ullman">
<text>Tracey Ullman (born Trace Ullman; 30 December 1959) is a British-American actress, comedian, singer, dancer, screenwriter, producer, and director. Critics have lauded her ability to shift seamlessly in and out of character and accents, with many dubbing her the &quot;female Peter Sellers&quot;. Her earliest mainstream appearances were on British television sketch comedy shows &quot;A Kick Up the Eighties&quot; (with Rik Mayall and Miriam Margolyes) and &quot;Three of a Kind&quot; (with Lenny Henry and David Copperfield). For the latter she was BAFTA nominated in 1984. After a brief singing career (which garnered three top-ten singles), she appeared as Candice Valentine in &quot;Girls on Top&quot; with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders.

Ullman emigrated from the United Kingdom to the United States. She would go on to star in her own network television comedy series, &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; from 1987 until 1990, which also featured the first appearances of the long-running animated media franchise &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. She later produced programmes for HBO, including &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot; (1996–99) garnering numerous awards. Her sketch comedy series &quot;Tracey Ullman&#x27;s State of the Union&quot; ran from 2008 to 2010 on Showtime. She has appeared in several feature films, including in &quot;Plenty&quot; (1985), which earned Ullman a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress.

In 2016, she returned to British television with the BBC sketch comedy show &quot;Tracey Ullman&#x27;s Show&quot;, her first project for the broadcaster in over 30 years. This led to the creation of the topical comedy series &quot;Tracey Breaks the News&quot; in 2017.

In 2017, Ullman was reportedly Britain&#x27;s richest comedian and the second-richest British actress, with an estimated wealth of £80 million. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including twelve American Comedy Awards, seven Primetime Emmy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, four Satellite Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

==Early life==

Tracey Ullman was born in Slough, Buckinghamshire (now Berkshire), the younger of two daughters, to Doreen (née Cleaver; 1929–2015), who was of British and Roma extraction, and Anthony John Ullman (1917–1966), a Roman Catholic Pole. Anthony served in the Polish Army and took part in the Battle of Dunkirk during World War II. After emigrating and marrying in England, he worked as a solicitor, a furniture salesman, and a travel agent. He also brokered marriages and translated among the émigré Polish community.

When she was six, Ullman&#x27;s father, who had been recovering from a heart operation, died of a heart attack in front of her. She was subsequently uprooted to Hackbridge, southwest London. Her mother could barely make ends meet without their father&#x27;s income. In an effort to cheer her family up, Ullman, along with her sister Patti, created and performed nightly shows on their mother&#x27;s bedroom windowsill. After their mother remarried, the family began moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools, where she wrote and performed in school plays.

She eventually caught the attention of a headmaster, who recommended that she attend a performing arts school. She won a full scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy at the age of twelve. At sixteen, she attended a dance audition under the impression that she was applying for summer season in Scarborough. The audition resulted in a contract with a German ballet company for a revival of &quot;Gigi&quot; in Berlin. Upon returning to England, she joined the Second Generation dance troupe, performing in London, Blackpool, and Liverpool. She branched out into musical theatre and was cast in numerous West End musicals including &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;Elvis The Musical&quot;, and &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;.

==Television career==
===Early years===
Ullman began her television career in 1980 playing Lynda Bellingham&#x27;s daughter in the British series &quot;Mackenzie&quot;. &quot;I really thought I was great when I did a quite serious soap opera for the BBC. I played a nice girl from St. John&#x27;s Wood. &#x27;Mummy, I think I&#x27;m pregnant. I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s done it.&#x27; Then I would fall down a hill or something. &#x27;EEEEE! Oh, no, lost another baby.&#x27; It seemed all I ever did was have miscarriages—or make yogurt.&quot;

Ullman appeared in Les Blair&#x27;s avant-garde &quot;Four in a Million&quot;, an improvised play about club acts, at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre. She won the London Critics Circle Theatre Award as Most Promising New Actress for her performance.

In 1981, she was cast in the BBC Scotland sketch comedy programme &quot;A Kick Up the Eighties&quot;, which in turn led to her being offered the sketch show &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;, co-starring comedians Lenny Henry and David Copperfield. Ullman said &quot;My first reaction was you must be joking, as women are treated so shoddily in comedy. Big busty barmaids and all those sort of clichés just bore me rigid.&quot; Eventually a deal was struck with the proviso being that she would have script approval and choose her own costumes. &quot;Three of a Kind&quot; premiered in July 1981, running for three series until 1983. Throughout the series, Ullman would also sing, performing comical spoofs of well-known artists of the time such as Toyah, Bananarama, Jennifer Warnes, and Dollar. &quot;Three of a Kind&quot; led to her beginning her own brief but successful singing career in 1983, and also winning her first BAFTA (for &quot;Best Light Entertainment Performance&quot;) in 1984. By this time, she had become a household name with the British media referring to her as &quot;Our Trace&quot;.

In 1985, she signed on to star in the ITV sitcom &quot;Girls on Top&quot;. She was cast as the promiscuous golddigger Candice Valentine. The show, co-starring Dawn French, Ruby Wax, and Jennifer Saunders continued for a second series without Ullman who bowed out after the first series. Saunders also wrote the scripts.

===&quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;===

In 1985, Ullman was persuaded by her husband, British independent television producer Allan McKeown, to join him in Los Angeles, where he was already partially based. She set her sights on a film and stage career, believing that there was little in the way of television for her. Her British agent put together a videotape compilation of her work and began circulating it around Hollywood. The tape landed in the hands of Craig Kellem, vice president for comedy at Universal Television. A deal was immediately struck with CBS. &quot;I Love New York&quot;, a show about a &quot;slightly wacky&quot; British woman working in New York, was written by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer Anne Beatts. Unhappy with the direction the network wanted to take the show, Ullman&#x27;s agent decided to contact producer James L. Brooks. Brooks felt that a sketch show would best suit her. &quot;Why would you do something with Tracey playing a single character on TV when her talent requires variety? You can&#x27;t categorize Tracey, so it&#x27;s silly to come up with a show that attempted to.&quot; &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; debuted on 5 April 1987, along with &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. The show also produced &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as a series of animated shorts, or &quot;bumpers&quot;, which would air before and after commercial breaks. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; shorts would eventually be spun-off into their own half-hour series in 1989. &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; was awarded ten Primetime Emmy Awards, with Ullman winning three, one in the category of Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 1990. The show was the first Fox network primetime show to win an Emmy award. The show concluded after a four-season run in 1990.

===HBO===
In 1991, Ullman&#x27;s husband placed a successful bid on a television franchise in the South of England. The television programming lineup agreed upon included a Tracey Ullman special. Unlike the Fox show, this programme would be shot entirely on location. &quot;Tracey Ullman: A Class Act&quot;, a send-up of the British class system, premiered on 9 January 1993 on ITV. This led to HBO in America becoming interested in having a special made for their network, with the caveat that Ullman take on a more American subject. She chose New York City. &quot;Tracey Ullman Takes on New York&quot; debuted on 9 October 1993. The programme went on to win two Emmy Awards, a CableAce Award, an American Comedy Award, and a Writers Guild of America Award. The success led to the creation of the HBO sketch comedy series &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot; in 1996.

Ullman returned to HBO in 2003 with the television special &quot;Tracey Ullman in the Trailer Tales&quot;, which she also directed. She returned to HBO again in 2005 with her one-woman stage show &quot;Tracey Ullman: Live and Exposed&quot;.

===Purple Skirt and Oxygen===
In 2001, Ullman took a break from her multi-character-based work and created a fashion-based talk show for Oxygen Network, &quot;Tracey Ullman&#x27;s Visible Panty Lines&quot;. The series was spun-off from her e-commerce clothing store Purple Skirt. Interviewees included Arianna Huffington and Charlize Theron. The show ran for two seasons, concluding in 2002.

===Showtime===
Upon her naturalisation in the United States, it was announced in April 2007 that she would be making the switch from HBO to Showtime after working fourteen years with the former. &quot;Tracey Ullman&#x27;s State of the Union&quot;, a new sketch comedy series, debuted on 30 March 2008. It ran for three seasons, concluding in 2010.

===Return to British television===
After an absence of over 30 years, Ullman returned to the BBC with the sketch comedy programme &quot;Tracey Ullman&#x27;s Show&quot; in 2016. It aired in the United States on HBO. In 2017, the show earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Make-Up and Hair Design, and its first Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category of Outstanding Variety Sketch Series. In 2018, it garnered two additional Primetime Emmy Award nominations in the categories of Outstanding Variety Sketch Series and Outstanding Costumes for a Variety, Nonfiction, or Reality Programming. The show eventually led to the creation of the topical comedy programme &quot;Tracey Breaks the News&quot; in 2017.

===Other notable work===
In 1995, she became the first modern-day cartoon voice of Little Lulu. In 1999, she had a recurring role as an unconventional psychotherapist on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. Her performance garnered her a Primetime Emmy Award, her seventh, and an American Comedy Award which was her eleventh. In 2005, she co-starred with Carol Burnett in the television adaptation of &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;. She played Princess Winnifred, a role originally made famous by Burnett on Broadway. This time Burnett took on the role of the overbearing Queen Aggravain.

In March 2014, Ullman was introduced as Genevieve Scherbatsky, the mother of character Robin Scherbatsky in &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. On 15 February 2017, it was announced that she would star in the Starz-BBC co-produced limited series adaptation of &quot;Howards End&quot;, playing Aunt Juley Mund.

On 14 May 2019, it was announced that Ullman would be portraying Betty Friedan in the FX limited series &quot;Mrs. America&quot;. The nine-episode series premiered 15 April 2020 on Hulu to favourable reviews. Her performance garnered her an Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie Primetime Emmy nomination.

Ullman played councilwoman Irma Kostroski in the eleventh and twelfth seasons of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

==Music career==

A chance encounter with the wife of the head of Stiff Records led to Ullman getting a recording contract in 1983. Label owner Dave Robinson was taken with some of the musical parodies she had been doing on television in &quot;Three of a Kind&quot; and signed her. Ullman recounted, &quot;One day, I was at my hairdresser, and Dave Robinson&#x27;s wife Rosemary leant over and said, &#x27;Do you want to make a record?&#x27;... I went, &#x27;Yeah I want to make a record.&#x27; I would have tried anything.&quot;

Within 18 months, Ullman had scored five Top 30 hits on the UK Singles Chart. Her first two singles (&quot;Breakaway&quot; and &quot;They Don&#x27;t Know&quot;) were certified Silver by the BPI, as was her debut album. Ullman&#x27;s songs were over-the-top evocations of 1960s and 1970s pop music with a 1980s edge, &quot;somewhere between Minnie Mouse and the Supremes&quot; as &quot;Melody Maker&quot; put it.

Her 1983 debut album &quot;You Broke My Heart in 17 Places&quot; was a Top 20 hit in the UK, and featured three UK Top 10 hit singles. Her first hit single, &quot;Breakaway&quot;, reached #4 in the UK. This was followed by the international hit version of Kirsty MacColl&#x27;s &quot;They Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, which reached #2 in the UK, and #8 in the United States. The video for &quot;They Don&#x27;t Know&quot; featured a cameo appearance from Paul McCartney (at the time, Ullman was filming a minor role in McCartney&#x27;s film &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street).&quot; A third single from the album, a recording of Doris Day&#x27;s &quot;Move Over Darling&quot;, reached #8 in the UK.

Ullman released her second (and final) album &quot;You Caught Me Out&quot; in 1984. This included her version of Madness&#x27;s &quot;My Girl&quot;, which she changed to &quot;My Guy&quot;, which reached #23. Its accompanying video featured a cameo from the British Labour Party politician Neil Kinnock, at the time the Leader of the Opposition. Her final Top 30 hit, &quot;Sunglasses&quot; (1984), peaked at #18 in the UK and featured comedian Adrian Edmondson in its music video. During this time she also appeared as a guest VJ on MTV in the United States.

==Film career==
Along with her television work, Ullman has featured in many films throughout her career. Her first theatrical film was a small role in Paul McCartney&#x27;s film &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot; (1984). This was followed by a supporting role in the drama &quot;Plenty&quot; (1985) starring Meryl Streep. She made her big screen leading role debut in &quot;I Love You to Death&quot; (1990) acting alongside Kevin Kline, River Phoenix, and Joan Plowright. She appeared in lead and supporting roles in films such as &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; (1993), Nancy Savoca&#x27;s &quot;Household Saints&quot; (1993), &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994), &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; (2000), &quot;Panic&quot; (2000) and &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; (2004). She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her work in &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; in 2001. She played Jack&#x27;s mother in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (2014) and appeared in the musical film &quot;The Prom&quot; (2020).

Her voice work in film includes &quot;Tim Burton&#x27;s Corpse Bride&quot; and the animated films &quot;The Tale of Despereaux&quot; and &quot;Onward&quot;.

==Theatre==
Ullman has an extensive stage career spanning back to the 1970s. In 1980, she appeared in Victoria Wood&#x27;s &quot;Talent&quot; at the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool. In 1982, she played Kate Hardcastle in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;. In 1983, she took part in the workshop for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, playing the part of Pearl, and performed in Snoo Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Grass Widow&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre with Alan Rickman.

In 1990, she starred opposite actor Morgan Freeman as Kate in Shakespeare in the Park&#x27;s production of &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; set in the Wild West for Joe Papp. In 1991, she performed on Broadway in Jay Presson Allen&#x27;s one-woman show &quot;The Big Love&quot;, based on the book of the same name. Both &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;The Big Love&quot; garnered her Theatre World Awards.

In 2011, she returned to the British stage in the Stephen Poliakoff drama &quot;My City&quot;. Her performance earned her an &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Awards nomination for Best Actress. In 2012, she joined the cast of Eric Idle&#x27;s &quot;What About Dick?&quot;, described as a 1940s-style stand-up improv musical comedy radio play, taking on three roles. The show played for four nights in April in Los Angeles at the Orpheum Theater. She had performed the piece previously in a test run for Idle back in 2007. Cast members included Idle, Eddie Izzard, Billy Connolly, Russell Brand, Tim Curry, Jane Leeves, Jim Piddock, and Sophie Winkleman. On 6 October 2014, it was formally announced that she would star in a limited engagement of &quot;The Band Wagon&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ullman married producer Allan McKeown in 1983. The couple have two children: Mabel, born in 1986, and John, born in 1991. On 24 December 2013, McKeown died at home from prostate cancer. 

Ullman&#x27;s mother died in a fire at her flat on 23 March 2015. An inquest ruled the death to be accidental. She was 85 years old.

In September 2018, Ullman said that her daughter was pregnant and that she was about to become a grandmother.

Ullman acquired American citizenship in December 2006. She holds dual citizenship in the United Kingdom and the United States.

<text>Standard of living is the level of income, comforts and services available to an individual, community or society. A contributing factor to an individual&#x27;s quality of life, standard of living is generally concerned with objective metrics outside an individual&#x27;s personal control, such as economic, societal, political, and environmental matters. Individuals or groups use the standard of living to evaluate where to live in the world, or when assessing the success of society.

In international law, an &quot;adequate standard of living&quot; was first described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and further described in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. To evaluate the impact of policy for sustainable development, different disciplines have defined Decent Living Standards in order to evaluate or compare relative living experience.

During much of its use in economics, improvements to standard of living were thought to be directly connected to economic growth, as well as increase amount of energy consumption and other materials. However, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report found that literature demonstrates that improvements in sustainable development practices as well as changes in technological efficiency and energy production and use, allow for a Decent Living Standard for all people without fossil fuels and ~15.3 GJ per capita by the end of the 21st century. This allows for climate change mitigation by demand reduction as well as other sustainable development practices.

== Factors considered by scholars ==
Standard of living might be evaluated using a number of characteristics including as the quality and availability of employment, real income, disposable income, class disparity, poverty rate, quality and housing affordability, hours of work required to purchase necessities, gross domestic product, inflation rate, amount of leisure time, access to and quality of healthcare, quality and availability of education, literacy rates, life expectancy, occurrence of diseases, cost of goods and services, infrastructure, access to, quality and affordability of public transportation, national economic growth, economic and political stability, freedom, environmental quality, climate and safety. For the purposes of economics, politics and policy, it is usually compared across time or between groups defined by social, economic or geographical parameters.

== Right to an adequate standard of living ==
== Decent living standard ==

The standard of living varies between individuals depending on different aspects of life. The standard of living consists of the individuals having the basics such as food, shelter, social safety and interaction, which all contribute to their wellbeing and what is considered to be a decent living standard.

Commentators use a number of different measures and approaches to establish the decent living standard (DLS). The decent living standard revolves around the idea and principle that a majority of the population demand the basics that will allow them to have shelter, food and water; however it is not always able to be maintained for a long period of time.

== Measurement ==
Standard of living is generally measured by standards such as inflation-adjusted income per person and poverty rate. Other measures such as access and quality of health care, income growth inequality, and educational standards are also used. Examples are access to certain goods (such as the number of refrigerators per 1000 people), or measurement of health such as life expectancy. It is the ease by which people living in a time or place are able to satisfy their needs and/or wants.

There is also the biological standard of living, which pertains to how well the human biological organism fares in its socio-economic environment. It is often measured by the height of a population.

The idea of a &#x27;standard&#x27; may be contrasted with the quality of life, which takes into account not only the material standard of living but also other more intangible aspects that make up human life, such as leisure, safety, cultural resources, social life, physical health, environmental quality issues.

<doc id="53491" wikidata="Q1196930" url="?curid=53491" title="Source Mage">
<text>Source Mage is a source-based Linux distribution descended from Sorcerer. Components of this operating system are downloaded as source code and compiled locally on the user&#x27;s computer. 

==Notable features==
Source Mage is a source-based Linux distribution. Instead of delivering binaries to users, the source code is compiled locally on the users computer. This practice enables greater control over the software than other distributions that precompile software for users do, such as Ubuntu. Individual dependencies can be selected or deselected, saving valuable hard drive space and freeing RAM and CPU cycles. For instance, OpenSSH can be compiled without support for X11 sharing. One can choose to set cflags, cxxflags, and ldflags specific to their situation. Using a source-based distribution is one way to unlock the full performance of a computer, as many binary distros compile their software for a wide audience, not a particular group, such as users of a specific processor. When a Source Mage spell is &quot;cast&quot;, the latest stable release is downloaded from the developer&#x27;s site rather than Source Mage&#x27;s. This allows for the most up-to-date system, unlike Gentoo, another popular source-based distribution, which maintains its own customized cache of packages. SMGL changes as little as possible in packages (only to fit to bare standards such as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard), so it is more immune from the kind of errors resulting from distribution developers tampering, while in turn lacking the potentially necessary patches that projects like Gentoo and Debian apply.

==History==

In 2001, Kyle Sallee released a Linux distribution named Sorcerer GNU/Linux. Due to several issues, in 2002, Chuck S. Mead forked Sorcerer into Lunar Linux. Soon afterwards, Kyle Sallee took Sorcerer GNU/Linux offline. The remaining Sorcerer GNU/Linux development team brought it back online and continued development. A month later, Kyle Sallee brought his version of Sorcerer back online with a new license that prevented forking, dropping GNU/Linux from the name. Consequently, at the request of Sallee, the Sorcerer GNU/Linux team renamed their project Source Mage.

==Compiling==
Source Mage&#x27;s tagline is &quot;Linux so advanced, it may as well be magic&quot; (a reference to Clarke&#x27;s third law), and its commands have a &quot;sorcerous theme&quot;. The instructions to each package is called a &quot;spell&quot;, and its package management program is called &quot;sorcery&quot;. To install a package the user must &quot;cast&quot; that spell. Casting a spell consists of downloading the source code (if it is not already downloaded), checking for dependencies, casting them if necessary, compiling the program, and installing it. A set of available spells is called a &quot;grimoire&quot;. To uninstall a package the user must &quot;dispel&quot; the spell.

==Social contract==
Source Mage has established a distribution commitment. &quot;Source Mage Social Contract&quot; establishes its basic rules, which are similar though not identical to Debian&#x27;s. The first part of the contract ensures the freedom of Source Mage: 
Source Mage does not restrict the user&#x27;s choice of software to only free software: 

==Installation==
Installing Source Mage involves first creating a minimal installation with a kernel (so it can run), the GCC C compiler, a network connection, and a few other basic tools to support downloading and compiling source code. This enables the system to download, compile, and install all the other components, and the compilation results can be tailored for that specific system.

==Portability==
All Source Mage-maintained code is designed to presume a minimal system, and the base system doesn&#x27;t explicitly require a C++ compiler (Only GCC 4.x+ does, but can be replaced).

Besides POSIX-compliant tools, core components require only bash, sed and either gawk or mawk, instead of more heavyweight languages like Perl or Python. This makes Source Mage suitable for a small installation.

<doc id="53492" wikidata="Q55844" url="?curid=53492" title="Stanisław Wojciechowski">
<text>Stanisław Wojciechowski (; 15 March 1869 – 9 April 1953) was a Polish politician and scholar who served as President of Poland between 1922 and 1926, during the Second Polish Republic.

He was elected president in 1922, following the assassination of his predecessor Gabriel Narutowicz. During his presidency, Wojciechowski and his erstwhile friend Józef Piłsudski disagreed on the political direction of the nation. In 1926, Piłsudski staged a military coup, which resulted in Wojciechowski resigning from office.

== Early life ==
Stanisław Wojciechowski was born on 15 March 1869 in Kalisz into a Polish noble family with strong ties to the intelligentsia. He was one of seven children of Second Lieutenant Feliks Wojciechowski (1825-1881), a caretaker of a prison in Kalisz who participated during the January Uprising, and his wife Florentyna Vorhoff. He was raised in a spirit of patriotism and devotion to his homeland. In 1888, he graduated in the Men&#x27;s Classical Junior High School in Kalisz and began his studies at the Imperial University of Warsaw where he studied at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics until 1891. He belonged to the circle of the most active conspirators, participant of the secret student groups for self-improvement. Wojciechowski was active during his studies, first in the conspiratorial organization Association of the Polish Youth &quot;Zet&quot;, and later in the burgeoning socialist movement. By 1892, he had abandoned his studies and chose the life of an exile after his second arrest and detention by the czarist police, first going to Zürich and then Paris. There he learned the trade of typesetter with which he supported himself.

In 1892, Wojciechowski co-founded the Polish Socialist Party and many nationalist and socialists met in Paris. He travelled several more times illegally to Congress Poland and the Russian Empire and smuggled printing machine components and publications into the country. Together with Piłsudski, he formed the backbone of the socialist movement in Russian Poland. In 1899, he married Maria Wojciechowska, a daughter of a wealthy landowner of szlachta descent.

== Political movements and early career ==
After 1905, he left the Polish Socialist Party over disagreements on the political future of Poland and its relations to the international class struggle. During World War I, Stanisław Wojciechowski believed that Germany posed the biggest threat to Poland and thus decided to stay in Russia rather than side with his erstwhile friend Piłsudski. After the Russian evacuation of Congress Poland of 1915, he moved to Moscow where he remained active in Polish political circles. After the fall of the Tsarist regime was elected president of the Council of Polish Parties&#x27; Union, and heavily engaged on behalf of the Polish Army in Russia in 1918. He was forced to leave Moscow under threat of arrest once the Bolshevik regime seized power. On 15 January 1919, the Chief of State nominated him, Minister of Internal Affairs, in both the Cabinet of Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Leopold Skulski, whom Wojciechowski replaced during his numerous absences from the country. During this time, Wojciechowski also participated in the drafting of the Polish constitution.

==1922 presidential elections==
===First election===

In the legislative elections, Wojciechowski served as the candidate for the Senate though he failed to win a seat. After the legislative elections, a balance appeared between the left and right forces. This situation also preponderated in the National Assembly, which was to select a new president of Poland and produce a new presidential election. Piłsudski did not want to put up his candidacy, and Wincenty Witos was perceived as a person communicating with the right and not paying attention to the interests of rural villages. Therefore, the Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot; put forward and appointed Wojciechowski as the new candidate for the presidency not involved in current political games. He accepted this decision, but when the Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot; informed that Gabriel Narutowicz planned to withdraw from the presidential race. Witos persuaded Narutowicz not to do that.

Wojciechowski was defeated in the fourth ballot to Count Maurycy Zamoyski who received 228 votes and Wojciechowski only reached 152 votes. At the time of the elections, the main candidates were Zamoyski and Wojciechowski. Narutowicz&#x27;s good result was a surprise. Once the long voting was over, Zamoyski and Narutowicz advanced to the fifth ballot. Narutowicz finally won the election with the support of &quot;Piast&quot; (Wojciechowski was eliminated on the fourth round). Narutowicz prevailed thanks to the votes of the left, of the representatives for national minorities vote (these representatives were determined to defeat the National Democracy movement), and of the centrist Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot;. This last group, initially inclined toward Zamoyski, unexpectedly switched its backing to Narutowicz instead. Eventually, Narutowicz won 289 votes, whereas Zamoyski won only 227 votes, and so Narutowicz was elected the first president of the Second Polish Republic.

===Second election===
Following the assassination of President Narutowicz by Eligiusz Niewiadomski on 16 December 1922, Marshal of the Sejm Maciej Rataj, who served briefly as acting head of state after the assassination, set the date of a new presidential election on 20 December 1922. The right-wing put forward the candidacy of Professor Kazimierz Morawski. Wojciechowski was nominated again as a compromise candidate. Władysław Sikorski was also suggested as a compromise. Originally, Wincenty Witos recommended that his own party, PSL, vote for Morawski. The left-wing of PSL opposed this however, and decided to vote for Wojciechowski, in connection with the events that led to the murder of Narutowicz. As a result of the internal party discussion, it was decided to support Wojciechowski&#x27;s candidacy. In the first round, Wojciechowski secured 298 votes, with Morawski only gaining 221 votes, Wojciechowski won the election and became the second president of Poland. After the election, representatives of the National Assembly appeared in Wojciechowski&#x27;s residence to notify him about his election as president. He considered that the will of the Sejm and the Senate should be followed. Alfons Erdman appeared at Wojciechowski&#x27;s office and demanded he abstain from accepting his choice. It was nevertheless too late, Wojciechowski decided that delay in this matter was improper. On 20 December 1922, Wojciechowski took the presidential oath and became president.

==Presidency==

During his presidency, Wojciechowski attempted to be an enthusiastic politician, who was involved in the performance of the government. He actively supported the non-parliamentary ministry of Władysław Sikorski and Władysław Grabski. The height of the president&#x27;s political influence corresponded with Grabski&#x27;s cabinet period of activity. Wojciechowski participated in the Political Committee of the Council of Ministers and had an impact on the content of ordinances on the currency reform, created under special powers of attorney granted to the cabinet by the Sejm. Wojciechowski attempted to shape the Polish constitutional system by introducing a constructive vote of no confidence. The mission of forming a new government was entrusted to the leader of the largest group participating in the overthrow of the previous cabinet, and when Wojciechowski failed to select a cabinet, he advocated leaving the old cabinet or establishing a non-parliamentary cabinet. Wojciechowski used this method after the fall of the second cabinet of Wincenty Witos when he committed the purpose of setting a new ministry to Stanisław Thugutt. Another indication of Wojciechowski&#x27;s constitutional system was the adoption, opposite to the provisions of the constitution that the Sejm was assembling enduringly, and not in the session system. Wojciechowski never closed the session of the Sejm, which was dictated by the constitution.

Wojciechowski tried to maintain good relations with Józef Piłsudski, who was in perpetual dispute with the succeeding cabinets and some parliamentary groups. The reason for the conflict was the organization of military authorities. Piłsudski always saw Wojciechowski as a person who would take his side. When in June 1923, Stanisław Szeptycki addressed to the Sejm a bill on the highest military authorities, announcing the liquidation of the powerful military council, who Piłsudski served as the chairman, flared up a sharp dispute between him and the Marshal. Wojciechowski tried to settle this dispute. Accordingly, Piłsudski sent a letter to the president in which he addressed him with the words &quot;You have acted as a hangover in the matter of honour, which does not respect the rights of honour and forgets that honour belongs to people personally, not officially.&quot; Wojciechowski tried to negotiate between the opposing parties, including took into account the Maciej Rataj&#x27;s commentaries, who objected to committing the position of Minister of Military Affairs to Sikorski. Piłsudski did not want to compromise and treated Wojciechowski, as what Rataj regarded, defiantly and as a servant.


On 5 September 1924, Wojciechowski visited the Polish city of Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine). At the end of Kopernika and Legionów Street, an explosive charge was thrown towards the car where the president was travelling. Fortuitously, the bomb did not explode.. It was believed that the assassin was Stanisław Steiger, an employee of a commercial company and a student of Jewish law, who was immediately arrested and kept in prison throughout the subsequent trial, and was threatened by the death penalty. The first trial against Steiger took place on 15 and 16 September 1924 ere the District Court in Lviv. The prosecutor was Alfred Laniewski, and the defender was lawyer Michał Grek. The Regional Court referred the case to ordinary proceedings with the participation of sworn judges. In the proceedings, Steiger was defended by lawyer Natan Loewenstein. The trial during which Loewenstein gave his defence speech did not take place until 16 December 1925. Steiger spent all this time in custody, but by this time, new circumstances regarding the assassination attempt were revealed. Thanks to the lawyer&#x27;s speech, which Loewenstein published in Lviv a year later, the accused was cleared of the charges and acquitted. The suspect of the assassination ended up being Teofil Olszewski, from the Ukrainian Military Organization, who subsequently fled Poland by illegally crossing the German border near Bytom and was arrested by the Germans on 3 October 1924. Olszewski was convicted of crossing the border illegally for two weeks in prison, suspended for one year, and then granted political refugee status in Germany and permission to settle in Marienburg (Malbork), close to the Polish border.

On 7 May 1925, Wojciechowski travelled from Warsaw to Kraków with the entire ceremonial held by the president. After receiving a report at the station from the commander of the honour company, Wojciechowski asked him if the soldiers were singing religious songs. After receiving a proof answer, Wojciechowski instructed the soldiers to sing some of them. They sang for about twenty minutes until the train left. Such behaviour of the president caused an understandable sensation in the country.

===Fall from power===
In November 1925, the government of Prime Minister Władysław Grabski was replaced by the government of Aleksander Skrzyński, which had received support from the National Democrats and the Polish Socialist Party. General Lucjan Żeligowski became the new government&#x27;s minister of military affairs. However, after the PPS withdrew its support, this government also fell and was replaced by that of Prime Minister Wincenty Witos, formed by Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot; and Christian Union of National Unity (Chjeno-Piast). However, the new government had even less popular support than the previous ones, and pronouncements from Józef Piłsudski, who viewed the constant power shifts in the Sejm as chaotic and damaging, set the stage for a coup d&#x27;état. Apart from domestic turmoil, Polish politics had been shaken by a trade war with Germany, begun in June 1925, and by the signing of the Treaty of Locarno on 1 December. Under the terms of the treaty, the World War I western European Allied powers plus Germany guaranteed the inviolability of the German border with Belgium and France as determined by the Treaty of Versailles. On 10 May 1926, a coalition government of Christian Democrats and Agrarians was formed, and that same day Józef Piłsudski, in an interview with &quot;Kurier Poranny&quot; (the Morning Courier) newspaper, said that he was &quot;ready to fight the evil&quot; of sejmocracy and promised a &quot;sanation&quot; (restoration to health) of political life. The newspaper edition was confiscated by the authorities.

The night of 11 to 12 May, a state of alert was declared in the Warsaw military garrison, and some units marched to Rembertów, where they pledged their support to Piłsudski. On 12 May, they marched on Warsaw and captured bridges over the Wisła River. Meanwhile, Wincenty Witos&#x27; government declared a state of emergency. At about 17:00 hours, Marshal Piłsudski met Wojciechowski on the Poniatowski Bridge. Major Marian Porwit who commanded one of the troops loyal to the government), reported to the president, then reported to Piłsudski and witnessed the discussion between the two dignitaries. Piłsudski demanded the resignation of Witos&#x27; cabinet, while the President demanded Piłsudski&#x27;s capitulation. After the failure of negotiations and the president&#x27;s departure, Major Porwit refused Piłsudski to let him cross the bridge. On 14 May, at about 13:00 hours, Witos&#x27; cabinet decided to move from Belweder to Wilanów. Wojciechowski allowed this decision an hour later. 
After transferring to Wilanów, Wojciechowski and Witos negotiated with the commanders of troops loyal to the cabinet. The military decided they should move to Poznań and maintain the armed struggle from beyond. Eventually, to prevent the Warsaw fighting from turning into a country-wide civil war, both Wojciechowski and Witos decided to resign and issued an order to their troops to cease fratricidal fighting. A new government was formed under Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel, with Piłsudski as the new Minister of Military Affairs. On 31 May 1926, the National Assembly nominated Piłsudski to be president, but he declined. Eventually Ignacy Mościcki became the new president; Piłsudski, however, wielded much greater &quot; de facto&quot; power than his military ministry nominally gave him.

===Scientific career===

Following the resignation, Wojciechowski worked as a lecturer at the Warsaw School of Economics and the College of Agriculture in Warsaw. Wojciechowski served as the Director of the Cooperative Scientific Institute and later sat on the Scientific Council of the Institute. He published hermetic publications on cooperative activity, which he engaged in before he became an active politician. He wrote books such as the Organization of Agricultural Products Sales and the History of Polish Cooperatives until 1914. In 1937, he was the co-founder of the opposition Labor Party.

===Second World War===

On 10 November 1939, the Gestapo arrested Wojciehowski&#x27;s son, Edmund, as part of German AB-Aktion in Poland, and threatened with execution, as were other representatives of the Polish intelligentsia. Edmund was later released on 4 April 1940 because of Jerzy Antoni Potocki. He was later arrested again on 12 July 1940 because he was one of the 70 Warsaw lawyers who refused to remove Jewish associates from the Warsaw Bar Council. The Germans offered his release in exchange for Wojciechowski signing a declaration stating that the Polish government-in-exile was constitutionally illegal. Wojciechowski refused to sign the declaration and Edmund was transferred on 15 August 1940 to the Auschwitz as one of the 1666 people of the first transport from Warsaw, where he soon died of typhus on 23 February 1941. The family received a telegram sent from the concentration camp informing Wojciechowski about his son&#x27;s passing, and soon an urn of ashes containing the remains of Edmund was sent back to his parents. During the Warsaw Uprising, the ill Wojciechowski along with his wife Maria were rounded up by the Nazis and sent to Durchgangslager 121, a transit camp in Pruszków. Thanks to the efforts of the Polish sanitary staff, the German medical commission managed to release the former President from the camp.

===Death===

After the war, Wojciechowski retired to private life and died in Gołąbki (now Ursus) in 1953, at the age of 84. He was buried at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.

==Legacy==
Wojciechowski experienced a political life similar to that of many Central European politicians during the early 20th century. A radical in his youth, his ideology matured and grew more conservative with age. He was at the forefront of over a quarter-century of Polish political development and is considered one of the founders of the modern independent Polish state. Historians unanimously indicate that Wojciechowski remains a figure greatly underrated and believe that it should be remembered that his presidency fell on a particularly turbulent period in Polish history. He managed to make history as an outstanding politician and statesman and is remembered as a relentless defender of democratic values and a prominent patriot.

<text>Sir Christopher Frank Carandini Lee (27 May 1922 – 7 June 2015) was an English actor and singer. In a career spanning more than sixty years, Lee became known as an actor with a deep and commanding voice who often portrayed villains in horror and franchise films. Lee was knighted for services to drama and charity in 2009, received the BAFTA Fellowship in 2011 and received the BFI Fellowship in 2013.

Lee gained fame for portraying Count Dracula in seven Hammer Horror films. His other film roles include Francisco Scaramanga in the James Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), Count Dooku in three &quot;Star Wars&quot; films (1999–2005) and Saruman in both &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy (2001–2003) and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film trilogy (2012–2014). He frequently appeared opposite his friend Peter Cushing in horror films, and late in his career had roles in five Tim Burton films, including &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1999), &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; (2005), &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2005), &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010) and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (2012). Lee&#x27;s other notable roles include &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; (1957), &quot;Dracula&quot; (1958), &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1958), &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973), &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; (1990), &quot;Jinnah&quot; (1998), &quot;Glorious 39&quot; (2009) and &quot;Hugo&quot; (2011).

Before his acting career, Lee served in the Royal Air Force as an intelligence officer, attached to the No. 260 Squadron RAF during World War II as a liaison officer for the Special Operations Executive. He was discharged from the RAF in 1946 with the rank of flight lieutenant. Lee also sang, recorded opera and musical pieces between 1986 and 1998 and worked with several heavy metal bands; he appeared on the albums &quot;&quot; (2010) and &quot;&quot; (2013).
== Early life ==
Lee was born on 27 May 1922 in Belgravia, London, the son of Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Trollope Lee (1879–1941) of the 60th King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, and his wife, Countess Estelle Marie (née Carandini di Sarzano; 1889–1981). Lee&#x27;s father fought in the Boer War and First World War, and his mother was an Edwardian beauty who was painted by Sir John Lavery, Oswald Birley, and Olive Snell, and sculpted by Clare Sheridan. Lee&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Jerome Carandini, the Marquis of Sarzano, was an Italian political refugee; his wife, Lee&#x27;s great-grandmother, was English-born opera singer Marie Carandini (&quot;née&quot; Burgess). He had an elder sister, Xandra Carandini Lee (1917–2002).

Lee&#x27;s parents separated when he was four and divorced two years later. During this time, his mother took his sister and him to Wengen in Switzerland. After enrolling in Miss Fisher&#x27;s Academy in Territet, he played his first role, as Rumpelstiltskin. They then returned to London, where Lee attended Wagner&#x27;s private school in Queen&#x27;s Gate, and his mother married Harcourt George St-Croix Rose, a banker and uncle of Ian Fleming. Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, thus became Lee&#x27;s step-cousin. The family moved to Fulham, living next door to the actor Eric Maturin. One night, he was introduced to Prince Yusupov and Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, the assassins of Grigori Rasputin, who Lee was to play many years later.

When Lee was nine, he was sent to Summer Fields School, a preparatory school in Oxford, some of whose pupils later attended Eton. He continued acting in school plays, though &quot;the laurels deservedly went to Patrick Macnee.&quot; Lee applied for a scholarship to Eton, where his interview was in the presence of the ghost story author M.R. James. His poor maths skills meant that he was placed eleventh, and thus missed out on being a King&#x27;s Scholar by one place. His step-father was not prepared to pay the higher fees that being an Oppidan Scholar meant, so instead he attended Wellington College, where he won scholarships in the classics, studying Ancient Greek and Latin. Aside from a &quot;tiny part&quot; in a school play, he did not act while at Wellington. He was a &quot;passable&quot; racquets player and fencer and a competent cricketer but did not do well at the other sports played: hockey, football, rugby and boxing. He disliked the parades and weapons training and would always &quot;play dead&quot; as soon as possible during mock battles. Lee was frequently beaten at school, including once at Wellington for &quot;being beaten too often,&quot; though he accepted them as &quot;logical and therefore acceptable&quot; punishments for knowingly breaking the rules. At age 17, and with one year left at Wellington, the summer term of 1939 was his last. His step-father had gone bankrupt, owing £25,000 ().

His mother separated from Rose, and Lee had to get a job, his sister already working as a secretary for the Church of England Pensions Board. With most employers on or preparing to go on summer holidays, there were no immediate opportunities for Lee, who was sent to the French Riviera, where his sister was on holiday with friends. On his way there he stopped briefly in Paris, where he stayed with the journalist Webb Miller, a friend of Rose, and witnessed Eugen Weidmann&#x27;s execution by guillotine – the last public execution performed in France. Arriving in Menton, he stayed with the Russian Mazirov family, living among exiled princely families. It was arranged that he should remain in Menton after his sister had returned home, but with Europe on the brink of war, he returned to London instead. He worked as an office clerk for United States Lines, taking care of the mail and running errands.

== Military service ==
Lee served with the British Armed Forces during the Second World War. Much of what is known about Lee&#x27;s involvement during the war is based on Lee&#x27;s own account, specifically as described in his 2003 autobiography. However, some historians and academics have subsequently questioned aspects of Lee&#x27;s narrative.

=== Chronology of service as described by Lee ===
When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Lee had enrolled in a military academy and volunteered to fight for the Finnish Army against the Soviet Union during the Winter War. He and other British volunteers were kept away from the actual fighting, but they were issued with winter gear and were posted on guard duty a safe distance from the border. After two weeks in Finland, they returned home. In a later interview, Lee said he knew how to shoot but not how to ski and that he probably would not be alive if he had been allowed to go to the front line. Lee returned to work at United States Lines and found his work more satisfying, feeling that he was contributing. In early 1940, he joined Beecham&#x27;s, at first as an office clerk, then as a switchboard operator. When Beecham&#x27;s moved out of London, he joined the Home Guard. In the winter, his father fell ill with bilateral pneumonia and died on 12 March 1941. Realising that he had no inclination to follow his father into the Army, Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service, and volunteered for the Royal Air Force.

Lee reported to RAF Uxbridge for training and was then posted to the Initial Training Wing at Paignton. After he had passed his exams in Liverpool, the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan meant that he travelled on the &quot;Reina del Pacifico&quot; to South Africa, then to his posting at Hillside, at Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia. Training with de Havilland Tiger Moths, Lee was having his penultimate training session before his first solo flight, when he suffered from headaches and blurred vision. The medical officer hesitantly diagnosed a failure of his optic nerve, and he was told he would never be allowed to fly again. Lee was devastated, and the death of a fellow trainee from his former school, Summer Fields, only made him more despondent. His appeals were fruitless, and he was left with nothing to do. He was moved around to different flying stations before being posted to Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s capital, Salisbury, in December 1941. He then visited the Mazowe Dam, Marandellas, the Wankie Game Reserve and the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. Thinking he should &quot;do something constructive for my keep&quot;, he applied to join RAF Intelligence. His superiors praised his initiative, and he was seconded into the British South Africa Police and was posted as a warder at Salisbury Prison. He was then promoted to leading aircraftman. Leaving South Africa, he sailed from Durban to Suez on the &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;.

After &quot;killing time&quot; at RAF Kasfareet near the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal Zone in 1942, he resumed intelligence work in the city of Ismaïlia. He was then attached to No. 205 Group RAF before being commissioned at the end of January 1943, and attached to No. 260 Squadron RAF as an intelligence officer. As the North African Campaign progressed, the squadron &quot;leapfrogged&quot; between Egyptian airstrips, from RAF El Daba to Maaten Bagush and on to Mersa Matruh; they lent air support to the ground forces and bombed strategic targets. Lee, &quot;broadly speaking, was expected to know everything.&quot; The Allied advance continued into Libya, through Tobruk and Benghazi to the Marble Arch and then through El Agheila, Khoms and Tripoli, with the squadron averaging five missions a day. As the advance continued into Tunisia, with the Axis forces digging themselves in at the Mareth Line, Lee was almost killed when the squadron&#x27;s airfield was bombed. After breaking through the Mareth Line, the squadron made their final base in Kairouan; following the Axis surrender in North Africa in May 1943, the squadron moved to Zuwarah in Libya in preparation for the Allied invasion of Sicily. They then moved to Malta, and, after its capture by the British Eighth Army, the Sicilian town of Pachino, before making a permanent base in Agnone Bagni. At the end of July 1943, Lee received his second promotion of the year, this time to flying officer. After the Sicilian campaign was over, Lee came down with malaria for the sixth time in under a year, and was flown to a hospital in Carthage for treatment. When he returned, the squadron was restless, frustrated with a lack of news about the Eastern Front and the Soviet Union in general, and with no mail from home or alcohol. Unrest spread and threatened to turn into mutiny. Lee, by now an expert on Russia, talked them into resuming their duties, which much impressed his commanding officer.
After the Allied invasion of Italy, the squadron was based in Foggia and Termoli during the winter of 1943, where Lee was then seconded to the Army during an officers&#x27; swap scheme. During most of the Battle of Monte Cassino he was attached to the Gurkhas of the 8th Indian Infantry Division. While spending some time on leave in Naples, Lee climbed Mount Vesuvius, which erupted three days later. During the final assault on Monte Cassino, the squadron was based in San Angelo, and Lee was nearly killed when one of the planes crashed on takeoff, and he tripped over one of its live bombs. After the battle, the squadron moved to airfields just outside Rome, and Lee visited the city, where he met his mother&#x27;s cousin, Nicolò Carandini, who had fought in the Italian resistance movement. In November 1944, Lee was promoted to flight lieutenant and left the squadron in Iesi to take up a posting at Air Force HQ. Lee took part in forward planning and liaison, in preparation for a potential assault into the rumoured German Alpine Fortress. After the war ended, Lee was invited to go hunting near Vienna and was then billeted in Pörtschach am Wörthersee. For the final few months of his service, Lee, who spoke fluent French, Italian and German, among other languages, was seconded to the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects. Here, he was tasked with helping to track down Nazi war criminals. Of his time with the organisation, Lee said: &quot;We were given dossiers of what they&#x27;d done and told to find them, interrogate them as much as we could and hand them over to the appropriate authority&quot;. He completed his service with the RAF in 1946 with the rank of flight lieutenant.

Lee said that during the war he was attached to special forces, but declined to give details. Lee&#x27;s stepfather served as a captain in the Intelligence Corps, but it is unlikely he had any influence over Lee&#x27;s military career. Lee saw his stepfather for the last time on a bus in London in 1940, after he was divorced from Lee&#x27;s mother, and Lee did not speak to him.

=== Posthumous allegations of embellishment ===
Since his death, some have accused Lee of exaggerating and being intentionally misleading about his wartime service. Historian Gavin Mortimer stated that Lee &quot;hammed up&quot; details of his service, and that Lee &quot;never exactly lied about his creditable wartime record, but he encouraged its embellishment&quot;. Leanne Simpson of Bangor University stated that &quot;Actor Christopher Lee famously encouraged the embellishment of his two-year military service during World War II. Many believed he served in a number of elite British military units, including the SAS, but in truth he had only been attached as a RAF liaison officer. Though Lee never hid this fact, he failed to clarify his role and allowed false assumptions to be circulated&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1947–1957: Career beginnings ===
Returning to London in 1946, Lee was offered his old job back at Beecham&#x27;s with a significant raise, but he turned them down as &quot;I couldn&#x27;t think myself back into the office frame of mind.&quot; The Armed Forces were sending veterans with an education in the Classics to teach at universities, but Lee felt his Latin was too rusty and didn&#x27;t care for the strict curfews. During lunch with his mother&#x27;s cousin Nicolò Carandini, now the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Lee was detailing his war wounds when Carandini said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you become an actor, Christopher?&quot; Lee liked the idea, and after assuaging his mother&#x27;s protests by pointing to the successful Carandini performers in Australia (which included his great-grandmother Marie Carandini, who had been an opera singer), he met Nicolò&#x27;s friend Filippo Del Giudice, a lawyer-turned-film producer and head of Two Cities Films, part of the Rank Organisation. Lee recalled that Giudice &quot;looked me up and down&quot; and &quot;concluded that I was just what the industry had been looking for.&quot; He was sent to see Josef Somlo for a contract:

Somlo sent him to see Rank&#x27;s David Henley and Olive Dodds, who signed him on a seven-year contract. Like other students at Rank&#x27;s &quot;Charm School,&quot; Lee had difficulty finding work. He finally made his film début in 1948, in Terence Young&#x27;s Gothic romance &quot;Corridor of Mirrors&quot;. He played Charles; the director got around his height by placing him at a table in a nightclub alongside Lois Maxwell, Mavis Villiers, Hugh Latimer and John Penrose. Lee had a single line, &quot;a satirical shaft meant to qualify the lead&#x27;s bravura.&quot;

In this early period, he made an uncredited appearance in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948), as a spear carrier (his later co-star and close friend Peter Cushing played Osric). A few years later, he appeared in &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N.&quot; (1951) as a Spanish captain. He was cast when the director asked him if he could speak Spanish and fence, which he was able to do. Lee appeared uncredited in the American epic &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951), which was shot in Rome, playing a chariot driver and was injured when he was thrown from it at one point during the shoot.

He recalled that his breakthrough came in 1952, when Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. began making films at the British National Studios. He said in 2006, &quot;I was cast in various roles in 16 of them and even appeared with Buster Keaton and it proved an excellent training ground.&quot; The same year, he appeared in John Huston&#x27;s Oscar-nominated &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. Throughout the next decade, he made nearly 30 films, including &quot;The Cockleshell Heroes&quot;, playing mostly stock action characters.

=== 1957–1976: Work with Hammer ===
Lee&#x27;s first film for Hammer was &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; (1957), in which he played Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, with Peter Cushing as Baron Victor Frankenstein. It was the first film to co-star Lee and Cushing, who ultimately appeared together in over twenty films and became close friends. When he arrived at a casting session for the film, &quot;they asked me if I wanted the part, I said yes and that was that.&quot; A little later, Lee co-starred with Boris Karloff in the film &quot;Corridors of Blood&quot; (1958). Lee had previously appeared with Karloff in 1955 in the &quot;At Night, All Cats are Grey&quot; episode of the British television series &quot;Colonel March of Scotland Yard&quot;. Karloff and Lee were London neighbours for a time in the mid-1960s.

Lee&#x27;s own appearance as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster led to his first appearance as the Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula in the film &quot;Dracula&quot; (1958, known as &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; in the US). The film saw Lee&#x27;s &quot;triumphant debut&quot; fix the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture, according to writer Kevin Jackson. &quot;Dracula&quot; has been ranked among the best British films. Lee introduced a dark, brooding sexuality to the character, with Tim Stanley stating, &quot;Lee&#x27;s sensuality was subversive in that it hinted that women might quite like having their neck chewed on by a stud.&quot; The film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; ranked Lee&#x27;s portrayal as Dracula the 7th Greatest Horror Movie Character of All Time. CNN listed the performance third in their top 10 British villains, noting his &quot;chilling, sonorous tone.&quot; Lee accepted a similar role in an Italian-French horror picture called &quot;Uncle Was a Vampire&quot; (1959). The same year he starred as Kharis in the Hammer Horror film &quot;The Mummy&quot;.

Lee returned to the role of Dracula in Hammer&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1965). Lee&#x27;s role has no lines, he merely hisses his way through the film. Stories vary as to the reason for this: Lee states he refused to speak the poor dialogue he was given, but screenwriter Jimmy Sangster claims that the script did not contain any lines for the character. This film set the standard for most of the Dracula sequels in the sense that half the film&#x27;s running time was spent on telling the story of Dracula&#x27;s resurrection and the character&#x27;s appearances were brief. Lee went on record to state that he was virtually &quot;blackmailed&quot; by Hammer into starring in the subsequent films; unable or unwilling to pay him his going rate, they would resort to reminding him of how many people he would put out of work if he did not take part:

His roles in the films &quot;Dracula Has Risen from the Grave&quot; (1968), &quot;Taste the Blood of Dracula&quot; (1969), and &quot;Scars of Dracula&quot; (1970) all gave the Count very little to do. Lee said in an interview in 2005, &quot;all they do is write a story and try and fit the character in somewhere, which is very clear when you see the films. They gave me nothing to do! I pleaded with Hammer to let me use some of the lines that Bram Stoker had written. Occasionally, I sneaked one in.&quot; He starred in two further Dracula films for Hammer in the early 1970s, both of which attempted to bring the character into the modern-day era. These were not commercially successful: &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Satanic Rites of Dracula&quot; (1973). The latter film was tentatively titled &quot;Dracula Is Dead... and Well and Living in London&quot;, a parody of the stage and film musical revue &quot;Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris&quot;, but Lee was not amused. Speaking at a press conference in 1973 to announce the film, Lee said, &quot;I&#x27;m doing it under protest. I think it is fatuous. I can think of twenty adjectives – fatuous, pointless, absurd. It&#x27;s not a comedy, but it&#x27;s got a comic title. I don&#x27;t see the point.&quot; &quot;The Satanic Rites of Dracula&quot; was the last Dracula film in which Lee played the Dracula role, as he felt he had played the part too many times and that the films had deteriorated in quality.

In all, Lee played Dracula ten times: seven films for Hammer Productions, once for Jesús Franco&#x27;s &quot;Count Dracula&quot; (1970), uncredited in Jerry Lewis&#x27;s &quot;One More Time&quot; (1970) and Édouard Molinaro&#x27;s &quot;Dracula and Son&quot; (1976) (he also played an unnamed but Dracula-like vampire in &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; [1969]). Lee portrayed Rasputin in &quot;Rasputin, the Mad Monk&quot; (1966) and Sir Henry Baskerville (to Cushing&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes) in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1959). Lee later played Holmes himself in 1962&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace&quot;, and returned to Holmes films with Billy Wilder&#x27;s British-made &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1970), in which he plays Sherlock&#x27;s smarter brother, Mycroft. Lee considers this film to be the reason he stopped being typecast: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been typecast since. Sure, I&#x27;ve played plenty of heavies, but as Anthony Hopkins says, &quot;I don&#x27;t play villains, I play people.&quot;&quot; Lee played a leading role in the German film &quot;The Puzzle of the Red Orchid&quot; (1962), speaking German, which he had learned during his education in Switzerland. He auditioned for a part in the film &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962), but was turned down because he did not &quot;look like a military man.&quot; Some film books incorrectly credit him with a role in the film, something he had to correct for the rest of his life.

Lee&#x27;s friend the author Dennis Wheatley was responsible for bringing the occult to him. The company made two films from Wheatley&#x27;s novels, both starring Lee. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Lee&#x27;s performance in the first, &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot; (1967), as &quot;suave dignity&quot;. However, the second film, &quot;To the Devil a Daughter&quot; (1976), was troubled by production difficulties and was disowned by its author. Although financially successful, it was Hammer&#x27;s last horror film. Critic Leonard Maltin described it as &quot;well-made but lacking punch&quot;.
Like Cushing, Lee also appeared in horror films for other companies from 1957 to 1977. These included the Dr. Fu Manchu series of films made between 1965 and 1969 (beginning with &quot;The Face of Fu Manchu&quot;) in which he starred as the villain in yellowface make-up; &quot;I, Monster&quot; (1971), an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1886 novella &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, with the main characters&#x27; names changed to Dr. Charles Marlowe and Mr. Edward Blake; &quot;The Creeping Flesh&quot; (1972); and his personal favourite, which he considered his best film, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (1973), in which he played Lord Summerisle. Lee wanted to break free of his image as Dracula and take on more interesting acting roles. He met with screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, and they agreed to work together. Film director Robin Hardy and British Lion head Peter Snell became involved in the project. Shaffer had a series of conversations with Hardy, and the two decided that it would be fun to make a horror film centring on &quot;old religion,&quot; in sharp contrast to the popular Hammer films of the day. Shaffer read the David Pinner novel &quot;Ritual&quot;, in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the ritual murder of a young girl in a rural village, and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project. Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner £15,000 () for the rights to the novel, and Schaffer set to work on the screenplay. However, he soon decided that a direct adaptation would not work well, and began to craft a new story, using only the novel&#x27;s basic outline. Lee was so keen to get the film made, and the budget was so small, that he gave his services for free. He later called the film the best he had ever made.

Lee appeared as the on-screen narrator in Jess Franco&#x27;s &quot;Eugenie&quot; (1970) as a favour to producer Harry Alan Towers, unaware that it was softcore pornography, as the sex scenes were shot separately.

In addition to making films in the United Kingdom, Lee made films in mainland Europe: he appeared in two German films, &quot;Count Dracula&quot; (1970), where he again played the vampire count, and &quot;The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism&quot; (1967). Other films in Europe he made include &quot;Castle of the Living Dead&quot; (1964) and &quot;Horror Express&quot; (1972). Lee was a producer of the horror film &quot;Nothing But the Night&quot; (1972), in which he starred. It was the first and last film he produced, as he did not enjoy the process.

Lee appeared as the Comte de Rochefort in Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973). He injured his left knee during filming, something he still felt many years later. After the mid-1970s, Lee eschewed horror roles almost entirely. Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond spy novels and Lee&#x27;s step-cousin, had offered him the role of the titular antagonist in the first Eon-produced Bond film &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962). Lee enthusiastically accepted, but by the time Fleming told the producers, they had already chosen Joseph Wiseman for the role. Lee finally got to play a James Bond villain in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), in which he was cast as the assassin Francisco Scaramanga. Lee said of his performance, &quot;In Fleming&#x27;s novel he&#x27;s just a West Indian thug, but in the film he&#x27;s charming, elegant, amusing, lethal... I played him like the dark side of Bond.&quot;

Because of his filming schedule in Bangkok, film director Ken Russell was unable to sign Lee to play the Specialist in &quot;Tommy&quot; (1975). That role was eventually given to Jack Nicholson. In an AMC documentary on &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), John Carpenter states that he offered the role of Samuel Loomis to Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, before Donald Pleasence took the role. Years later, Lee told Carpenter that the biggest regret of his career was not taking the role of Dr. Loomis.

=== 1977–1999: Move to Hollywood ===

In 1977, Lee left the UK for the US, concerned at being typecast in horror films, as had happened to his close friends Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. His first American appearance was in the disaster film &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; (1977). In 1978, Lee surprised many people with his willingness to go along with a joke, appearing as guest host on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Steven Spielberg, who was in the audience for that show, cast him in &quot;1941&quot; (1979). Meanwhile, Lee co-starred with Bette Davis in the Disney film &quot;Return from Witch Mountain&quot; (1978). He turned down the role of Dr. Barry Rumack (finally played by Leslie Nielsen) in the disaster spoof &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), a decision he later called &quot;a big mistake.&quot; 

Lee played the mad scientist Dr. Catheter in &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; (1990). In a nod to his role as Dracula in Hammer Films, as the Bat Gremlin transforms, Dr. Catheter experiences deja-vu – the audience hears Dracula music. Lee made his last appearances as Sherlock Holmes in the television films &quot;Incident at Victoria Falls&quot; (1991) and &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady&quot; (1992).

Lee and Peter Cushing appeared together in more than a dozen feature films together for Hammer Films, Amicus Productions, and other companies, as well as in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1948) and &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (1952), albeit in separate scenes. They featured, too, in separate instalments of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films: Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin in the original film, and Lee decades later as Count Dooku. The last project which united them in person was a documentary, &quot;Flesh and Blood: The Hammer Heritage of Horror&quot; (1994), which they jointly narrated, two months before Cushing&#x27;s death.

Lee considered his best performance to be in this period, when he played Pakistan&#x27;s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the biopic &quot;Jinnah&quot; (1998).

=== 2000–2009: Resurgence in franchise films ===
Lee had many television roles. These included the role Flay in the BBC television miniseries &quot;Gormenghast&quot; (2000) based on Mervyn Peake&#x27;s novels. He also appeared as Lucas de Beaumanoir, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, in the BBC/A&amp;E co-production of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1997).

Lee portrayed Saruman in Peter Jackson&#x27;s fantasy action epic &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. In the commentary, he stated that for decades he had dreamt of playing Gandalf. He conceded that he was now too old, and that his physical limitations prevented him from being considered; Ian McKellen, who was in his early-60s, was cast in the role alongside Lee, in his mid-70s. The role of Saruman, unlike that of Gandalf, required no horse riding and far less fighting. Lee had met J. R. R. Tolkien once, which made him the only person involved in Peter Jackson&#x27;s films to have done so. He made a habit of reading the novels at least once a year. In addition, he performed for The Tolkien Ensemble&#x27;s album &quot;At Dawn in Rivendell&quot; in 2003. Lee&#x27;s appearance in the final film in the trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, was cut from the theatrical release, but the scene was reinstated in the extended edition. &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; marked the beginning of a major career revival that continued with the role of the villainous Count Dooku in the George Lucas directed &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005). Lee acted opposite Hayden Christensen, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman and did most of the swordplay himself, though a stunt double was required for the long shots with more vigorous footwork.

In 2005, Lee played Dr. Wonka, father of Willy Wonka, in Tim Burton&#x27;s film adaptation of the Roald Dahl children&#x27;s classic &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.&quot; He also voiced Pastor Galswells in the animated film &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;. In 2007, Lee collaborated with Burton again on &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, playing the spirit of Sweeney Todd&#x27;s victims, called the Gentleman Ghost, alongside Anthony Head, with both singing &quot;The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,&quot; its reprises and the Epilogue. These songs were recorded, but eventually cut since Burton felt that the songs were too theatrical for the film. Lee&#x27;s appearance was completely cut from the film, but Head still had an uncredited one-line cameo. Also in 2007 he played the First High Councillor in &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;. In late November 2009, Lee narrated the Science Fiction Festival in Trieste, Italy. Also in 2009, Lee starred in Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s British period drama &quot;Glorious 39&quot;, Academy Award-nominated director Danis Tanović&#x27;s war film &quot;Triage&quot;, and Duncan Ward&#x27;s comedy &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot;.

During this time Lee provided voices for numerous films and video games. He spoke fluent English, Italian, French, Spanish, and German, and was moderately proficient in Swedish, Russian, and Greek. He was the original voice of Thor in the German dubs of the Danish 1986 animated film &quot;Valhalla&quot;, and of King Haggard in both the English and German dubs of the 1982 animated adaptation of &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;. He provided all the voices for the English dub of &quot;Monsieur Hulot&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1953). He voiced Death in the animated versions of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Soul Music&quot; and &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;, and reprised the role in the Sky1 live action adaptation &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, taking over from the late Ian Richardson. He provided the voice for the role of Ansem the Wise/DiZ in video games including &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;.
Lee reprised his role as Saruman in the video game &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth&quot;. He narrated and sang for the Danish musical group The Tolkien Ensemble&#x27;s 2003 studio album &quot;At Dawn in Rivendell&quot;, taking the role of Treebeard, King Théoden and others in the readings or singing of their respective poems or songs. In 2007, he voiced the transcript of &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien for the audiobook version of the novel. In 2005, Lee provided the voice of Pastor Galswells in &quot;The Corpse Bride&quot;, co-directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson. He served as the narrator on &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; poem, also written by Tim Burton as well. Lee reprised his role as Count Dooku in the animated film &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; (2008).

Some thirty years after playing Francisco Scaramanga in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, Lee provided the voice of Scaramanga in the video game &quot;&quot;. In 2013, Lee voiced The Earl of Earl&#x27;s Court in the BBC Radio 4 radio play &quot;Neverwhere&quot; by Neil Gaiman. Lee recorded special dialogue, in addition to serving as the Narrator, for the &quot;Lego The Hobbit&quot; video game released in April 2014; at 91 years and 316 days old he appears in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the oldest video game narrator.

=== 2010–2015: Later roles ===
In 2004, Lee lamented that Hollywood scripts were mainly spin-offs, as people were afraid of taking financial risks, commenting that he was mostly being offered spin-offs of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; or &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In 2010, he marked his fourth collaboration with Tim Burton by voicing the Jabberwock in Burton&#x27;s adaptation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s classic book &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, alongside Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway. Lee respected Depp as &quot;a fellow survivor&quot;, describing him as &quot;inventive and [having] enormous versatility&quot;. In 2010, Lee received the Steiger Award (Germany) and, in February 2011, Lee was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship.

In 2011, he appeared in a Hammer film, &quot;The Resident&quot;, for the first time in 35 years. The film was directed by Antti Jokinen, and Lee gave a &quot;superbly sinister&quot; performance alongside Hilary Swank and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. While filming scenes for the film in New Mexico in early 2009, Lee injured his back when he tripped over power cables on set. Lee appears as the unnamed &quot;Old Gentleman&quot; who acts as Lachlan&#x27;s mentor in a flashback. Also in 2011, Lee appeared in the critically acclaimed &quot;Hugo&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese.

Lee reprised the role of Saruman for the prequel film &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. He said he would have liked to have shown Saruman&#x27;s corruption by Sauron, but was too old to travel to New Zealand, so the production was adjusted to allow him to participate from London. In 2012, Lee marked his fifth and final collaboration with Tim Burton, by appearing in Burton&#x27;s film adaptation of the gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, in the small role of a New England fishing captain.
In an interview in August 2013, Lee said that he was &quot;saddened&quot; to hear his friend Johnny Depp was considering retiring from acting, observing that he himself had no intention of doing that:
Lee narrated the feature-length documentary &quot;Necessary Evil: Super-Villains of DC Comics&quot;, which was released on 25 October 2013. In 2014, he appeared in an episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;Timeshift&quot; called &quot;How to Be Sherlock Holmes: The Many Faces of a Master Detective&quot;. Lee and others who had played Sherlock Holmes discussed the character and the various interpretations of him. He appeared in a web exclusive, reading an excerpt from the Sherlock Holmes short story &quot;The Final Problem&quot;.

A month before his death, Lee had signed to star with an ensemble cast in the Danish film &quot;The 11th&quot;. One of his final performances was the independent &quot;Angels in Notting Hill&quot; directed by Michael Pakleppa, a fantasy film about an angel trapped in London who falls in love with a human being. Lee played The Boss / Mr. President and the film premiered in the Regent Street Cinema, London on 29 October 2016.

== Music career ==
With his operatic bass voice, Lee sang on &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; soundtrack, performing Paul Giovanni&#x27;s composition, &quot;The Tinker of Rye.&quot; He sang the closing credits song of the 1994 horror film &quot;Funny Man&quot;. In 1977, he appeared on Peter Knight and Bob Johnson&#x27;s (from Steeleye Span) concept album &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Lee&#x27;s first contact with heavy metal music came by singing a duet with Fabio Lione, lead vocalist of the Italian symphonic power metal band Rhapsody of Fire on the single &quot;The Magic of the Wizard&#x27;s Dream&quot; from their 2004 album &quot;Symphony of Enchanted Lands II – The Dark Secret&quot;, although he only performs backing vocals on the album version. Later he appeared as a narrator and backing vocalist on the band&#x27;s four albums &quot;Symphony of Enchanted Lands II – The Dark Secret&quot;, &quot;Triumph or Agony&quot;, &quot;The Frozen Tears of Angels&quot;, and &quot;From Chaos to Eternity&quot;, as well as on the EP &quot;The Cold Embrace of Fear – A Dark Romantic Symphony&quot;, portraying the Wizard King. He worked with Manowar while they were recording a new version of their first album, &quot;Battle Hymns&quot;. The original voice was Orson Welles&#x27;s (long dead at the time of the re-recording).

With the song &quot;Jingle Hell,&quot; Lee entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Singles Sales chart at No. 22, thus becoming the second oldest living performer to ever enter the music charts, at 91 years and 6 months. After media attention, the song rose to No. 18. as Lee became the oldest person to have a top 20 hit.

Lee released a third EP of covers in May 2014, called &quot;Metal Knight,&quot; to celebrate his 92nd birthday; in addition to a cover of &quot;My Way,&quot; it contains &quot;The Toreador March,&quot; inspired by the opera &quot;Carmen&quot;, and the songs &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot; and &quot;I, Don Quixote&quot; from the Don Quixote musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;. Lee was inspired to record the latter songs because, &quot;as far as I am concerned, Don Quixote is the most metal fictional character that I know.&quot; His fourth EP and third annual Christmas release came in December 2014, as he put out &quot;Darkest Carols, Faithful Sing,&quot; a playful take on &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.&quot; He explained: &quot;It&#x27;s light-hearted, joyful and fun... At my age, the most important thing for me is to keep active by doing things that I truly enjoy. I do not know how long I am going to be around, so every day is a celebration, and I want to share it with my fans.&quot;

Lee is featured in the symphonic metal album &quot;&quot; in 2010, after having worked with several metal bands since 2005. The heavy metal follow-up &quot;&quot; was released in 2013 on Lee&#x27;s 91st birthday. He was honoured with the &quot;Spirit of Hammer&quot; award at the 2010 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards ceremony. On the self-titled debut album by Hollywood Vampires, a supergroup consisting of Johnny Depp, Alice Cooper and Joe Perry, Lee is featured as a narrator in the track &quot;The Last Vampire.&quot; Recorded shortly before his death, this marks Lee&#x27;s final appearance on a musical record. In 2019, Rhapsody of Fire included a posthumous narration on their new album, &quot;The Eighth Mountain&quot;, in which Lee narrated the concept story of the band&#x27;s &quot;Nephilim Empire Saga&quot;.

== Personal life ==

=== Family and relationships ===
The Carandinis, Lee&#x27;s maternal ancestors, were given the right to bear the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. In the late 1950s, Lee was engaged to Countess Henriette Ewa Agnes von Rosen, whom he had met at a nightclub in Stockholm. Her father, Count Fritz von Rosen, proved demanding, getting them to delay the wedding for a year, asking his London-based friends to interview Lee, hiring private detectives to investigate him, and asking Lee to provide him with references, which Lee obtained from Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Boulting, and Joe Jackson. Lee found the meeting of her extended family to be like something from a surrealist Luis Buñuel film, and thought they were &quot;killing me with cream.&quot; Finally, Lee had to have the permission of the King of Sweden to marry. Lee had met him some years before while filming &quot;Tales of Hans Anderson&quot;, where he received his blessing. However, shortly before the wedding, Lee ended the engagement. He was concerned that his financial insecurity in his chosen profession meant that she &quot;deserved better&quot; than being &quot;pitched into the dishevelled world of an actor.&quot; She understood, and they called the wedding off.

Lee was introduced to Danish painter and former model Birgit &quot;Gitte&quot; Krøncke (1935–2024) by a Danish friend in 1960. They were engaged soon after, and married on 17 March 1961. They had a daughter, Christina Erika Carandini Lee (b. 1963). Lee was the uncle of the British actress Harriet Walter. Both Lee and his daughter Christina provided spoken vocals on Rhapsody of Fire&#x27;s album &quot;From Chaos to Eternity&quot;. Lee relocated to Los Angeles in the 1970s after becoming disillusioned with film roles he was being offered in Britain at the time and stated that in Hollywood &quot;I was no longer a &quot;horror star.&quot; I was an actor.&quot; He subsequently moved back to England and lived with his family in Cadogan Square in west London until his death. 

=== Physical characteristics and beliefs ===
Lee was known for his imposing height of . On BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Test Match Special&quot; &quot;View from the Boundary&quot; interview with Brian Johnston on 20 June 1987, Lee described himself as being tall. Lee and his wife Birgit were listed among the fifty best-dressed over 50s by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in March 2013.

Lee was an Anglo-Catholic Christian. After the Second World War, he was an altar server at St Stephen&#x27;s Church in South Kensington, London, during T. S. Eliot&#x27;s period as a parishioner there. Politically, Lee supported the Conservative Party. Regarding Islam, he stated that Islamic terrorism &quot;is not the true Islam.&quot;

Lee had an interest in the occult, to which he was introduced by Dennis Wheatley. It was once erroneously reported Lee had a library of occult literature that amounted to 20,000 books. However, during a talk at University College Dublin Lee confirmed he did not have such a collection and said &quot;Somebody wrote that I had 20,000 books. I don&#x27;t—I&#x27;d have to live in a bath!&quot; He furthermore cautioned the audience against involving themselves in occult practices, claiming &quot;I have met people who claim to be Satanists, who claim to be involved with black magic, who claimed that they not only knew a lot about it. But as I said, I certainly have not been involved and I warn all of you: never, never, never. You will not only lose your mind: you lose your soul.&quot;

== Death ==
Lee died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 7 June 2015 at the age of 93. The cause of death was heart failure. His wife delayed the public announcement until 11 June, informing his family of the death before releasing the news to the press.

Following Lee&#x27;s death, fans, friends, actors, directors and others involved in the film industry publicly gave their personal tributes. Then-Prime Minister David Cameron praised Lee as a &quot;titan of the golden age of cinema.&quot; He was honoured by the academy at the 88th Academy Awards on 28 February 2016 in the annual in Memoriam section.

== Honours and legacy ==
Lee was the subject of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1974, where he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. In 1994, for his influence on the horror genre, he received the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 1997, he was appointed a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John. On 16 June 2001, as part of that year&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Lee was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire &quot;for services to Drama.&quot; He was made a Knight Bachelor &quot;For services to Drama and to Charity&quot; on 13 June as part of the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours in 2009. The French government made him a Commander of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2011.

Lee was named 2005&#x27;s &quot;most marketable star in the world&quot; in a &quot;USA Today&quot; newspaper poll, after three of the films he appeared in grossed US$640 million. In 2010, he was identified as the IMDb member with the greatest closeness centrality, implying he was the best-connected person in the business.

In 2008, Lee in his role as Count Dracula featured on a commemorative UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail to mark 50 years since the release of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1958) by Hammer Films. In 2010, Lee received the Spirit of Hammer award at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards, for his contribution to the metal genre. In 2011, Lee was awarded a BAFTA Fellowship; he received a BFI Fellowship in 2013.

In 2011, accompanied by his wife Birgit, and on the 164th anniversary of the birth of Bram Stoker, Lee was honoured with a tribute by University College Dublin, and described his honorary life membership of the UCD Law Society as &quot;in some ways as special as the Oscars.&quot; He was awarded the Bram Stoker Gold Medal by the Trinity College Philosophical Society, of which Stoker had been president, and a copy of &quot;Collected Ghost Stories of MR James&quot; by Trinity College&#x27;s School of English.

<doc id="53495" wikidata="Q512196" url="?curid=53495" title="Lord Protector">
<text>Lord Protector (plural: &quot;Lords Protector&quot;) is a title that has been used in British constitutional law for the head of state. It was also a particular title for the British heads of state in respect to the established church. It was sometimes used to refer to holders of other temporary posts; for example, a regent acting for the absent monarch.

==Feudal royal regent==
The title of &quot;The Lord Protector&quot; was originally used by royal princes or other nobles exercising a role as protector and defender of the realm, while also sitting (typically as chairman) on a regency council, governing for a monarch who was unable to do so (on account of minority, absence from the realm on Crusade, madness, etc.).

Notable cases in England:
* John, Duke of Bedford, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, were (5 December 1422 – 6 November 1429) jointly Lords Protector for Henry VI (1421–1471);
* Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, was three times (3 April 1454 – February 1455; 19 November 1455 – 25 February 1456; and 31 October – 30 December 1460) Lord Protector for Henry VI;
* Richard, Duke of Gloucester, was &quot;Lord Protector of the Realm&quot; (10 May 1483 – 26 June 1483) during the nominal reign of Edward V (one of the Princes in the Tower) before being offered the throne as Richard III;
* Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, was Lord Protector (4 February 1547 – 11 October 1549) during the early years of the reign of the young Edward VI;
and in Scotland:
* John Stewart, Duke of Albany, was &quot;Governor and Protector of the Realm&quot; (12 July 1515 – 16 November 1524) for James V of Scotland (1512–1542);
* James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault, was &quot;Governor and Protector of the Kingdom&quot; (3 January 1543 – 12 April 1554) for Mary, Queen of Scots.

==Cromwellian Commonwealth==

The Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland was the title of the head of state and head of government during the Commonwealth (often called the Interregnum), following the first period when a Council of State held executive power. The title was held by Oliver Cromwell (December 1653 – September 1658) and subsequently his son and designated successor Richard Cromwell (September 1658 – May 1659) during what is now known as The Protectorate.

The 1653 Instrument of Government (republican constitution) stated:

The replacement constitution of 1657, the Humble Petition and Advice, gave &quot;His Highness the Lord Protector&quot; the power to nominate his successor. Cromwell chose his eldest surviving son, the politically inexperienced Richard. That was a nonrepresentative and de facto dynastic mode of succession, with royal connotations in both styles awarded (even a double invocation 16 December 1653 – 3 September 1658 &quot;By the Grace of God and Republic Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland&quot;) and many other monarchic prerogatives, such as that of awarding knighthoods.

Richard Cromwell, who succeeded after his father&#x27;s death in September 1658, held the position for only eight months before he resigned in May 1659. He was followed by the second period of Commonwealth rule until the Restoration of the exiled heir to the Stuart throne, Charles II, in May 1660.

===Lords Protector (1653–1659)===
==Post-Cromwell==
Since the Restoration the title has not been used in either of the above manners. George, Prince of Wales, appointed to the regency in 1811, was referred to as &quot;His Royal Highness the Prince Regent&quot;. George exercised the powers of the monarchy, just as Lords Protector had, but the title&#x27;s republican associations had rendered it distasteful.

== Protector of the church ==
&#x27;Lord Protector&#x27; has also been used as a rendering of the Latin &quot;Advocatus&quot; in the sense of a temporal Lord (such as a monarch) who acted as the protector of the mainly secular interests of a part of the church; compare the French title of &quot;vidame&quot;.

==In fiction==

In the novel &quot;The Last Man&quot; by Mary Shelley, Britain becomes a republic with its elected head of state styled as Lord Protector. The title is held by Lord Raymond, and Ryland. In 1987 television series &quot;The New Statesman&quot; finale episode &quot;The Irresistible Rise of Alan B&#x27;Stard&quot;, after B&#x27;Stard&#x27;s New Patriotic Party wins a landslide majority in a special general election called over British membership of the European Economic Community but with himself not having contested a seat, he briefly considered adopting the title of Lord Protector before being permitted to serve as an extra-parliamentary Prime Minister.
In the 2008 film adaptation of C. S. Lewis&#x27; &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, the antagonist Miraz begins as Lord Protector of Narnia before being proclaimed King (a change from the novel). In the 2020 film &quot;Wolfwalkers&quot;, the Lord Protector serves as its primary antagonist.

<text>In visual perception, an optical illusion (also called a visual illusion) is an illusion caused by the visual system and characterized by a visual percept that arguably appears to differ from reality. Illusions come in a wide variety; their categorization is difficult because the underlying cause is often not clear but a classification proposed by Richard Gregory is useful as an orientation. According to that, there are three main classes: physical, physiological, and cognitive illusions, and in each class there are four kinds: Ambiguities, distortions, paradoxes, and fictions. A classical example for a physical distortion would be the apparent bending of a stick half immersed in water; an example for a physiological paradox is the motion aftereffect (where, despite movement, position remains unchanged). An example for a physiological fiction is an afterimage. Three typical cognitive distortions are the Ponzo, Poggendorff, and Müller-Lyer illusion. Physical illusions are caused by the physical environment, e.g. by the optical properties of water. Physiological illusions arise in the eye or the visual pathway, e.g. from the effects of excessive stimulation of a specific receptor type. Cognitive visual illusions are the result of unconscious inferences and are perhaps those most widely known.

Pathological visual illusions arise from pathological changes in the physiological visual perception mechanisms causing the aforementioned types of illusions; they are discussed e.g. under visual hallucinations.

Optical illusions, as well as multi-sensory illusions involving visual perception, can also be used in the monitoring and rehabilitation of some psychological disorders, including phantom limb syndrome and schizophrenia.

== Physical visual illusions ==
A familiar phenomenon and example for a physical visual illusion is when mountains appear to be much nearer in clear weather with low humidity (Foehn) than they are. This is because haze is a cue for depth perception, signalling the distance of far-away objects (Aerial perspective).

The classical example of a physical illusion is when a stick that is half immersed in water appears bent. This phenomenon was discussed by Ptolemy () and was often a prototypical example for an illusion.

== Physiological visual illusions ==
Physiological illusions, such as the afterimages following bright lights, or adapting stimuli of excessively longer alternating patterns (contingent perceptual aftereffect), are presumed to be the effects on the eyes or brain of excessive stimulation or interaction with contextual or competing stimuli of a specific type—brightness, color, position, tile, size, movement, etc. The theory is that a stimulus follows its individual dedicated neural path in the early stages of visual processing and that intense or repetitive activity in that or interaction with active adjoining channels causes a physiological that alters perception.

The Hermann grid illusion and Mach bands are two illusions that are often explained using a biological approach. Lateral inhibition, where in receptive fields of the retina receptor signals from light and dark areas compete with one another, has been used to explain why we see bands of increased brightness at the edge of a color difference when viewing Mach bands. Once a receptor is active, it inhibits adjacent receptors. This inhibition creates contrast, highlighting edges. In the Hermann grid illusion, the gray spots that appear at the intersections at peripheral locations are often explained to occur because of lateral inhibition by the surround in larger receptive fields. However, lateral inhibition as an explanation of the Hermann grid illusion has been disproved.
More recent empirical approaches to optical illusions have had some success in explaining optical phenomena with which theories based on lateral inhibition have struggled.

== Cognitive illusions ==

Cognitive illusions are assumed to arise by interaction with assumptions about the world, leading to &quot;unconscious inferences&quot;, an idea first suggested in the 19th century by the German physicist and physician Hermann Helmholtz. Cognitive illusions are commonly divided into ambiguous illusions, distorting illusions, paradox illusions, or fiction illusions.
* &quot;Ambiguous illusions&quot; are pictures or objects that elicit a perceptual &quot;switch&quot; between the alternative interpretations. The Necker cube is a well-known example; other instances are the Rubin vase and the &quot;squircle&quot;, based on Kokichi Sugihara&#x27;s ambiguous cylinder illusion.
* &quot;Distorting&quot; or &quot;geometrical-optical illusions&quot; are characterized by distortions of size, length, position or curvature. A striking example is the Café wall illusion. Other examples are the famous Müller-Lyer illusion and Ponzo illusion.
* &quot;Paradox illusions&quot; (or &quot;impossible object illusions&quot;) are generated by objects that are paradoxical or impossible, such as the Penrose triangle or impossible staircase seen, for example, in M. C. Escher&#x27;s &quot;Ascending and Descending&quot; and &quot;Waterfall&quot;. The triangle is an illusion dependent on a cognitive misunderstanding that adjacent edges must join.
* &quot;Fictions&quot; are when a figure is perceived even though it is not in the stimulus, like with the Kanizsa triangle, using illusory contours.

== Explanation of cognitive illusions ==

=== Perceptual organization ===


To make sense of the world it is necessary to organize incoming sensations into information which is meaningful. Gestalt psychologists believe one way this is done is by perceiving individual sensory stimuli as a meaningful whole. Gestalt organization can be used to explain many illusions including the rabbit–duck illusion where the image as a whole switches back and forth from being a duck then being a rabbit and why in the figure–ground illusion the figure and ground are reversible.
In addition, gestalt theory can be used to explain the illusory contours in the Kanizsa&#x27;s triangle. A floating white triangle, which does not exist, is seen. The brain has a need to see familiar simple objects and has a tendency to create a &quot;whole&quot; image from individual elements. &quot;Gestalt&quot; means &quot;form&quot; or &quot;shape&quot; in German. However, another explanation of the Kanizsa&#x27;s triangle is based in evolutionary psychology and the fact that in order to survive it was important to see form and edges. The use of perceptual organization to create meaning out of stimuli is the principle behind other well-known illusions including impossible objects. The brain makes sense of shapes and symbols putting them together like a jigsaw puzzle, formulating that which is not there to that which is believable.

The gestalt principles of perception govern the way different objects are grouped. Good form is where the perceptual system tries to fill in the blanks in order to see simple objects rather than complex objects. Continuity is where the perceptual system tries to disambiguate which segments fit together into continuous lines. Proximity is where objects that are close together are associated. Similarity is where objects that are similar are seen as associated. Some of these elements have been successfully incorporated into quantitative models involving optimal estimation or Bayesian inference.

The double-anchoring theory, a popular but recent theory of lightness illusions, states that any region belongs to one or more frameworks, created by gestalt grouping principles, and within each frame is independently anchored to both the highest luminance and the surround luminance. A spot&#x27;s lightness is determined by the average of the values computed in each framework.

=== Depth and motion perception ===
Illusions can be based on an individual&#x27;s ability to see in three dimensions even though the image hitting the retina is only two dimensional. The Ponzo illusion is an example of an illusion which uses monocular cues of depth perception to fool the eye. But even with two-dimensional images, the brain exaggerates vertical distances when compared with horizontal distances, as in the vertical–horizontal illusion where the two lines are exactly the same length.

In the Ponzo illusion the converging parallel lines tell the brain that the image higher in the visual field is farther away, therefore, the brain perceives the image to be larger, although the two images hitting the retina are the same size. The optical illusion seen in a diorama/false perspective also exploits assumptions based on monocular cues of depth perception. The M.C. Escher painting &quot;Waterfall&quot; exploits rules of depth and proximity and our understanding of the physical world to create an illusion. Like depth perception, motion perception is responsible for a number of sensory illusions. Film animation is based on the illusion that the brain perceives a series of slightly varied images produced in rapid succession as a moving picture. Likewise, when we are moving, as we would be while riding in a vehicle, stable surrounding objects may appear to move. We may also perceive a large object, like an airplane, to move more slowly than smaller objects, like a car, although the larger object is actually moving faster. The phi phenomenon is yet another example of how the brain perceives motion, which is most often created by blinking lights in close succession.

The ambiguity of direction of motion due to lack of visual references for depth is shown in the spinning dancer illusion. The spinning dancer appears to be moving clockwise or counterclockwise depending on spontaneous activity in the brain where perception is subjective. Recent studies show on the fMRI that there are spontaneous fluctuations in cortical activity while watching this illusion, particularly the parietal lobe because it is involved in perceiving movement.

=== Color and brightness constancies ===

Perceptual constancies are sources of illusions. Color constancy and brightness constancy are responsible for the fact that a familiar object will appear the same color regardless of the amount of light or color of light reflecting from it. An illusion of color difference or luminosity difference can be created when the luminosity or color of the area surrounding an unfamiliar object is changed. The luminosity of the object will appear brighter against a black field (that reflects less light) than against a white field, even though the object itself did not change in luminosity. Similarly, the eye will compensate for color contrast depending on the color cast of the surrounding area.

In addition to the gestalt principles of perception, water-color illusions contribute to the formation of optical illusions. Water-color illusions consist of object-hole effects and coloration. Object-hole effects occur when boundaries are prominent where there is a figure and background with a hole that is 3D volumetric in appearance. Coloration consists of an assimilation of color radiating from a thin-colored edge lining a darker chromatic contour. The water-color illusion describes how the human mind perceives the wholeness of an object such as top-down processing. Thus, contextual factors play into perceiving the brightness of an object.

=== Object ===

Just as it perceives color and brightness constancies, the brain has the ability to understand familiar objects as having a consistent shape or size. For example, a door is perceived as a rectangle regardless of how the image may change on the retina as the door is opened and closed. Unfamiliar objects, however, do not always follow the rules of shape constancy and may change when the perspective is changed. The Shepard tables illusion is an example of an illusion based on distortions in shape constancy.

=== Future perception ===

Researcher Mark Changizi of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has a more imaginative take on optical illusions, saying that they are due to a neural lag which most humans experience while awake. When light hits the retina, about one-tenth of a second goes by before the brain translates the signal into a visual perception of the world. Scientists have known of the lag, yet they have debated how humans compensate, with some proposing that our motor system somehow modifies our movements to offset the delay.

Changizi asserts that the human visual system has evolved to compensate for neural delays by generating images of what will occur one-tenth of a second into the future. This foresight enables humans to react to events in the present, enabling humans to perform reflexive acts like catching a fly ball and to maneuver smoothly through a crowd. In an interview with ABC Changizi said, &quot;Illusions occur when our brains attempt to perceive the future, and those perceptions don&#x27;t match reality.&quot; For example, an illusion called the Hering illusion looks like bicycle spokes around a central point, with vertical lines on either side of this central, so-called vanishing point.
The illusion tricks us into thinking we are looking at a perspective picture, and thus according to Changizi, switches on our future-seeing abilities. Since we are not actually moving and the figure is static, we misperceive the straight lines as curved ones.
Changizi said:
Evolution has seen to it that geometric drawings like this elicit in us premonitions of the near future. The converging lines toward a vanishing point (the spokes) are cues that trick our brains into thinking we are moving forward—as we would in the real world, where the door frame (a pair of vertical lines) seems to bow out as we move through it—and we try to perceive what that world will look like in the next instant.

== Pathological visual illusions (distortions) ==
A pathological visual illusion is a distortion of a real external stimulus and is often diffuse and persistent. Pathological visual illusions usually occur throughout the visual field, suggesting global excitability or sensitivity alterations. Alternatively visual hallucination is the perception of an external visual stimulus where none exists. Visual hallucinations are often from focal dysfunction and are usually transient.

Types of visual illusions include oscillopsia, halos around objects, illusory palinopsia (visual trailing, light streaking, prolonged indistinct afterimages), akinetopsia, visual snow, micropsia, macropsia, teleopsia, pelopsia, metamorphopsia, dyschromatopsia, intense glare, blue field entoptic phenomenon, and purkinje trees.

These symptoms may indicate an underlying disease state and necessitate seeing a medical practitioner. Etiologies associated with pathological visual illusions include multiple types of ocular disease, migraines, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, head trauma, and prescription drugs. If a medical work-up does not reveal a cause of the pathological visual illusions, the idiopathic visual disturbances could be analogous to the altered excitability state seen in visual aura with no migraine headache. If the visual illusions are diffuse and persistent, they often affect the patient&#x27;s quality of life. These symptoms are often refractory to treatment and may be caused by any of the aforementioned etiologies, but are often idiopathic. There is no standard treatment for these visual disturbances.

== Connections to psychological disorders ==

=== The rubber hand illusion (RHI) ===

The rubber hand illusion (RHI), a multi-sensory illusion involving both visual perception and touch, has been used to study how phantom limb syndrome affects amputees over time. Amputees with the syndrome actually responded to RHI more strongly than controls, an effect that was often consistent for both the sides of the intact and the amputated arm. However, in some studies, amputees actually had stronger responses to RHI on their intact arm, and more recent amputees responded to the illusion better than amputees who had been missing an arm for years or more. Researchers believe this is a sign that the body schema, or an individual&#x27;s sense of their own body and its parts, progressively adapts to the post-amputation state. Essentially, the amputees were learning to no longer respond to sensations near what had once been their arm. As a result, many have suggested the use of RHI as a tool for monitoring an amputee&#x27;s progress in reducing their phantom limb sensations and adjusting to the new state of their body.

Other research used RHI in the rehabilitation of amputees with prosthetic limbs. After prolonged exposure to RHI, the amputees gradually stopped feeling a dissociation between the prosthetic (which resembled the rubber hand) and the rest of their body. This was thought to be because they adjusted to responding to and moving a limb that did not feel as connected to the rest of their body or senses.

RHI may also be used to diagnose certain disorders related to impaired proprioception or impaired sense of touch in non-amputees.

=== Illusions and schizophrenia ===

Schizophrenia, a mental disorder often marked by hallucinations, also decreases a person&#x27;s ability to perceive high-order optical illusions. This is because schizophrenia impairs one&#x27;s capacity to perform top-down processing and a higher-level integration of visual information beyond the primary visual cortex, V1. Understanding how this specifically occurs in the brain may help in understanding how visual distortions, beyond imaginary hallucinations, affect schizophrenic patients. Additionally, evaluating the differences between how schizophrenic patients and unaffected individuals see illusions may enable researchers to better identify where specific illusions are processed in the visual streams.

One study on schizophrenic patients found that they were extremely unlikely to be fooled by a three dimensional optical illusion, the hollow face illusion, unlike non-affected volunteers. Based on fMRI data, researchers concluded that this resulted from a disconnection between their systems for bottom-up processing of visual cues and top-down interpretations of those cues in the parietal cortex. In another study on the motion-induced blindness (MIB) illusion (pictured right), schizophrenic patients continued to perceive stationary visual targets even when observing distracting motion stimuli, unlike non schizophrenic controls, who experienced motion induced blindness. The schizophrenic test subjects demonstrated impaired cognitive organization, meaning they were less able to coordinate their processing of motion cues and stationary image cues.

== In art ==

Artists who have worked with optical illusions include M. C. Escher, Bridget Riley, Salvador Dalí, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Patrick Bokanowski, Marcel Duchamp, Jasper Johns, Oscar Reutersvärd, Victor Vasarely and Charles Allan Gilbert. Contemporary artists who have experimented with illusions include Jonty Hurwitz, Sandro del Prete, Octavio Ocampo, Dick Termes, Shigeo Fukuda, Patrick Hughes, István Orosz, Rob Gonsalves, Gianni A. Sarcone, Ben Heine and Akiyoshi Kitaoka. Optical illusion is also used in film by the technique of forced perspective.

Op art is a style of art that uses optical illusions to create an impression of movement, or hidden images and patterns. &quot;Trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;
uses realistic imagery to create the optical illusion that depicted objects exist in three dimensions.

Tourists attractions employing large-scale illusory art allowing visitors to photograph themselves in fantastic scenes have opened in several Asian countries, such as the Trickeye Museum and Hong Kong 3D Museum.

== Cognitive processes hypothesis ==

The hypothesis claims that visual illusions occur because the neural circuitry in our visual system evolves, by neural learning, to a system that makes very efficient interpretations of usual 3D scenes based in the emergence of simplified models in our brain that speed up the interpretation process but give rise to optical illusions in unusual situations. In this sense, the cognitive processes hypothesis can be considered a framework for an understanding of optical illusions as the signature of the empirical statistical way vision has evolved to solve the inverse problem.

Research indicates that 3D vision capabilities emerge and are learned jointly with the planning of movements. That is, as depth cues are better perceived, individuals can develop more efficient patterns of movement and interaction within the 3D environment around them. After a long process of learning, an internal representation of the world emerges that is well-adjusted to the perceived data coming from closer objects. The representation of distant objects near the horizon is less &quot;adequate&quot;. In fact, it is not only the Moon that seems larger when we perceive it near the horizon. In a photo of a distant scene, all distant objects are perceived as smaller than when we observe them directly using our vision.

<text>A monospaced font, also called a fixed-pitch, fixed-width, or non-proportional font, is a font whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space. This contrasts with variable-width fonts, where the letters and spacings have different widths.
Monospaced fonts are customary on typewriters and for typesetting computer code.

Monospaced fonts were widely used in early computers and computer terminals, which had limited graphical capabilities. Hardware implementation was simplified by using a text mode where the screen layout was addressed as a regular grid of tiles, each of which could be set to display a character by indexing into the hardware&#x27;s character map. Some systems allowed colored text to be displayed by varying the foreground and background color for each tile. Other effects included reverse video and blinking text. Nevertheless, these early systems were typically limited to a single console font.

Even though computers can now display a wide variety of fonts, the majority of IDEs and software text editors employ a monospaced font as the default typeface. This increases the readability of source code, which is often heavily reliant on distinctions involving individual symbols, and makes differences between letters more unambiguous in situations like password entry boxes where typing mistakes are unacceptable. Monospaced fonts are also used in terminal emulation and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents. In technical manuals and resources for programming languages, a monospaced font is often used to distinguish code from natural-language text. Monospaced fonts are also used by disassembler output, causing the information to align in vertical columns.

Optical character recognition has better accuracy with monospaced fonts. Examples are OCR-A and OCR-B.

The term &quot;modern&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;monospace&quot; generic font family. The term &quot;modern&quot; can be used for a fixed-pitch generic font family name, which is used in OpenDocument format (ISO/IEC 26300:2006) and Rich Text Format.

Examples of monospaced fonts include Courier, Lucida Console, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, Inconsolata, PragmataPro and Source Code Pro.

== Use in art ==
Multiple art forms have developed within computers&#x27; and typewriters&#x27; monospaced typographic settings in which the &quot;n&quot;th character of every line align vertically with each other. (Such a group of characters is sometimes called a column.) A proportional and monospaced font&#x27;s reproduction of an element of ANSI art, line drawing, is illustrated below.
The failure of a proportional font to reproduce the desired boxes above motivates monospaced fonts&#x27; use in the creation and viewing of ASCII and ANSI art. Some poetry composed monospaced on typewriters or computers also depends on the vertical alignment of character columns. E. E. Cummings&#x27; poetry is often set in monospaced type for this reason. Some classic video games (e.g. Rogue and NetHack) and those imitating their style (e.g. Dwarf Fortress) use a monospaced grid of characters to render their state for the player. &quot;Quiz Show&quot; (1976) is believed to be the first video game to use 8×8 monospaced &quot;arcade font&quot;, which got widely adopted by computer games of the time.

== Tabular figures ==

Many fonts that generally are not monospaced have numerals that are known as tabular figures. As tabular spacing makes all numbers with the same number of digits the same width, it is used for typesetting documents such as price lists, stock listings and sums in mathematics textbooks, all of which require columns of numbers to line up on top of each other for easier comparison. Tabular spacing is also a common feature of simple printing devices such as cash registers and date-stamps. Fonts intended for professional use in documents such as business reports may also make the bold numbers take up the same width as the numbers in regular style; the consistency between styles is called &quot;duplexing&quot;.

The alternative to tabular spacing is proportional spacing, which places the numbers closely together, reducing empty space in a document, and is thought to allow the numbers to blend into the text more effectively. With modern fonts using the TrueType or OpenType formats, it is possible to include both proportional and tabular figures in the same font file, and choose between them using font options settings in applications such as word processors or web browsers.

==Other uses==
In biochemistry, monospaced fonts are preferred for displaying nucleic acid and protein sequences, as they ensure that the representation of every nucleotide or amino acid occupies the same amount of space. Alignment of the letters makes it easier to compare different sequences visually.

Both screenplays and stage play scripts frequently use monospaced fonts, to make it easier to judge the time a script will last for from the number of pages. The industry standard is 12 point Courier. A tradition holds that, on this format, one page of script will take one minute of screen or stage time.

Monospaced fonts are frequently used in tablature music for guitar and bass guitar. Each line in a tabulature represents a guitar string, which requires that chords played across multiple strings be tabbed in vertical sequence, a feat accomplished only with the predictability of fixed width.

<doc id="53503" wikidata="Q313074" url="?curid=53503" title="Charles Rolls">
<text>Charles Stewart Rolls (27 August 1877 – 12 July 1910) was a British motoring and aviation pioneer. With Henry Royce, he co-founded the Rolls-Royce car manufacturing firm. He was the first Briton to be killed in an aeronautical accident with a powered aircraft, when the tail of his Wright Flyer broke off during a flying display in Bournemouth. He was aged 32.

==Early life==

Rolls was born in Berkeley Square, London, third son of the 1st Baron Llangattock of the Rolls family and Lady Llangattock. Despite his London birth, he retained a strong family connection with his ancestral home of The Hendre, near Monmouth, Wales. After attending Mortimer Vicarage Preparatory School in Berkshire, he was educated at Eton College where his developing interest in engines earned him the nickname &quot;dirty Rolls&quot;.

In 1894, he attended a private crammer in Cambridge which helped him gain entry to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1895, where he studied mechanical and applied science. In 1896, at the age of 18, he travelled to Paris to buy his first car, a Peugeot Phaeton, and joined the Automobile Club of France. His Peugeot is believed to have been the first car based in Cambridge, and one of the first three cars owned in Wales. An early motoring enthusiast, he joined the Self-Propelled Traffic Association, which campaigned against the restrictions imposed on motor vehicles by the Locomotive Acts, and became a founder member of the Automobile Club of Great Britain, with which the Association merged in 1897.

Rolls was a keen cyclist and spent time at Cambridge bicycle racing. In 1896, he won a Half Blue and the following year became captain of the Cambridge University Bicycle Club.

Rolls graduated from Cambridge in 1898 and began working on the steam yacht &quot;Santa Maria&quot; followed by a position at the London and North Western Railway in Crewe. However, his talents lay more in salesmanship and motoring pioneering than practical engineering; in January 1903, with the help of £6,600 provided by his father, he started one of Britain&#x27;s first car dealerships, C. S. Rolls &amp; Co. based in Lillie Hall, Fulham, to import and sell French Peugeot and Belgian Minerva vehicles.

==Partnership with Royce==
Rolls was introduced to Henry Royce by a friend at the Royal Automobile Club, Henry Edmunds, who was also a director of Royce Ltd. Edmunds showed him Royce&#x27;s car and arranged the historic meeting between Rolls and Royce at the Midland Hotel, Manchester, on 4 May 1904. In spite of his preference for three or four cylinder cars, Rolls was impressed with the two-cylinder Royce 10 and in a subsequent agreement of 23 December 1904 agreed to take all the cars Royce could make. These would be of two, three, four and six cylinders and would be badged as Rolls-Royces.
The first Rolls-Royce car, the Rolls-Royce 10 hp, was unveiled at the Paris Salon in December 1904, although in the early advertising it was the name of Rolls that was emphasised over that of Royce. In 1906 Rolls and Royce formalised their partnership by creating Rolls-Royce Limited, with Rolls appointed Technical Managing Director on a salary of £750 per annum plus 4% of the profits in excess of £10,000. Rolls provided the financial backing and business acumen to complement Royce&#x27;s technical expertise. In 1907 Rolls-Royce Limited bought out C. S. Rolls &amp; Co.

Rolls put much effort into publicising the quietness and smoothness of the Rolls-Royce, and at the end of 1906 travelled to the US to promote the new cars. The company was winning awards for the quality and reliability of its cars by 1907. But by 1909 Rolls&#x27; interest in the business was waning, and at the end of the year he resigned as Technical managing director and became a non-executive director.

==Pioneer aviator==

Rolls was a pioneer aviator and initially, balloonist, making over 170 balloon ascents. In 1903 he won the Gordon Bennett Gold Medal for the longest single flight time.

By 1907 Rolls&#x27; interest turned increasingly to flying and he tried to persuade Royce to design an aero engine. He became the second Briton to go up in an aeroplane. Piloted by Wilbur Wright their flight on 8 October 1908 from Camp d&#x27;Auvours, eleven kilometres east of Le Mans, lasted four minutes and twenty seconds. He bought one of six Wright Flyer aircraft built by Short Brothers under licence from the Wright Brothers and from early October 1909 made more than 200 flights. Founder in 1901 with Frank Hedges Butler of the ballooning club that became the Royal Aero Club in March 1910 he was the second person they licensed to fly an aeroplane. 

Rolls became the first man to make a non-stop double crossing of the English Channel by plane, taking 95 minutes on 2 June 1910. For this feat, which included the first eastbound aerial crossing of the English Channel, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club. There is a statue in Monmouth to commemorate the flight and another, by Kathleen Scott, in Dover.
==Death==

On 12 July 1910, at the age of 32, Rolls was killed in an air crash at Hengistbury Airfield, Southbourne, Bournemouth when the tail of his Wright Flyer broke off during a flying display. He was the first Briton to be killed in an aeronautical accident with a powered aircraft, and the eleventh person internationally. His was also the first powered aviation fatality in the United Kingdom.

His grave lies at the churchyard of St Cadoc&#x27;s Church, Llangattock-Vibon-Avel, where many of the Rolls family lie buried in various family tombs. His grave is just below Llangattock Manor and bears the inscription:

&quot;Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.&quot;

A statue in his memory, in which he is seen holding a biplane model, was erected in Agincourt Square, Monmouth. A further memorial to him was unveiled in 1981 in the bottom playing field of St Peter&#x27;s Catholic School, Bournemouth, which was developed on the site of Hengistbury Airfield. There is a stained-glass window in All Saints&#x27; Church, Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey, dedicated jointly to Rolls and to fellow pioneer aviator Cecil Grace.

A memorial to Charles Rolls was dedicated 12 July 2022, at Hengistbury Head, Southbourne, Dorset, between the car park and the Hiker cafe.

This was the same day, date and time as it was in 1910 at the time of his crash at Southbourne, Hampshire [as it was at the time] when the tail came off of his Wright Flyer during a flying display on the airfield at what is now St Peters School.

<text>Augustus Edwin John (4 January 1878 – 31 October 1961) was a Welsh painter, draughtsman, and etcher. For a time he was considered the most important artist at work in Britain: Virginia Woolf remarked that by 1908 the era of John Singer Sargent and Charles Wellington Furse &quot;... was over. The age of Augustus John was dawning.&quot; He was the younger brother of the painter Gwen John.

==Early life==
Born in Tenby, at 11, 12 or 13 The Esplanade, now known as The Belgrave Hotel, Pembrokeshire, John was the younger son and third of four children. His father was Edwin William John, a Welsh solicitor; his mother, Augusta Smith (1848–1884), from a long line of Sussex master plumbers, died when he was six, but not before inculcating a love of drawing in both Augustus and his older sister Gwen. At the age of seventeen he briefly attended the Tenby School of Art, then left Wales for London, studying at the Slade School of Art, University College London. He became the star pupil of drawing teacher Henry Tonks and even before his graduation he was considered the most talented draughtsman of his generation. His sister, Gwen was with him at the Slade and became an important artist in her own right. In the 1890s, John lodged in studios at Tite Street, Chelsea.

In 1897, John hit submerged rocks diving into the sea at Tenby, suffering a serious head injury; the lengthy convalescence that followed seems to have stimulated his adventurous spirit and accelerated his artistic growth. In 1898, he won the Slade Prize with &quot;Moses and the Brazen Serpent.&quot; John afterward studied independently in Paris where he seems to have been influenced by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.
 The need to support Ida Nettleship (1877–1907), whom he married in 1901, led him to accept a post teaching art at the University of Liverpool.

==North Wales==
Over a period of two years from around 1910 Augustus John and his friends James Dickson Innes painted in the Arenig valley, and one of Innes&#x27;s favourite subjects was the mountain Arenig Fawr. In 2011 this period was made the subject of a BBC documentary titled &quot;The Mountain That Had to Be Painted&quot;.

==Alderney Manor==
Alderney Manor, Dorset, was sited on the Poole to Ringwood road between Knighton Bottom and Howe Corner from the early 19th century. John established an artists&#x27; colony there in 1911. Faye Hammill relates how he lived there with &quot;his five legitimate children, his mistress Dorelia McNeill, and his two children by her; and they remained there until 1927, in the company of numerous long-term guests&quot;. One frequent visitor was fellow artist Henry Lamb. Aspects of John&#x27;s life during this period were used as background by Margaret Kennedy in her novel &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; (1924). A housing estate now occupies the site.

==Provence==
In February 1910, John visited and fell in love with the town of Martigues, in Provence, located halfway between Arles and Marseilles, and first seen from a train en route to Italy. John wrote that Provence &quot;had been for years the goal of my dreams&quot; and Martigues was the town for which he felt the greatest affection. &quot;With a feeling that I was going to find what I was seeking, an anchorage at last, I returned from Marseilles, and, changing at Pas des Lanciers, took the little railway which leads to Martigues. On arriving my premonition proved correct: there was no need to seek further.&quot; The connection with Provence continued until 1928, by which time John felt the town had lost its simple charm, and he sold his home there.

John was, throughout his life, particularly interested in the Romani people (whom he referred to as &quot;Gypsies&quot;), and sought them out on his frequent travels around the United Kingdom and Europe, learning to speak various versions of their language. For a time, shortly after his marriage, he and his family, which included his wife Ida, mistress Dorothy (Dorelia) McNeill, and John&#x27;s children by both women, travelled in a caravan, in gypsy fashion. Later on he became the President of the Gypsy Lore Society, a position he held from 1937 until his death in 1961.

By 1913, John was successful enough to commission a new home and studio at Mallord Street, Chelsea, from architect Robert van &#x27;t Hoff.

==War==
In December 1917 John was attached to the Canadian forces as a war artist and made a number of memorable portraits of Canadian infantrymen. The result was to have been a huge mural for Lord Beaverbrook and the sketches and cartoon for this suggest that it might have become his greatest large-scale work. However, like so many of his monumental conceptions, it was never completed. As a war artist, John was allowed to keep his beard; according to Wyndham Lewis, John was &quot;the only officer in the British Army, except the King, who wore a beard.&quot; After two months in France he was sent home in disgrace after taking part in a brawl. Lord Beaverbrook, whose intervention saved John from a court-martial, sent him back to France where he produced studies for a proposed Canadian War Memorial picture, although the only major work to result from the experience was &quot;Fraternity&quot;. In 2011, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge finally unveiled this mural at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa. This unfinished painting, &quot;The Canadians Opposite Lens&quot;, is 12 feet high by 40 feet long.
==Portraits==
Although known early in the century for his drawings and etchings, the bulk of John&#x27;s later work consisted of portraits. Those of his two wives and his children were regarded as among his best. He was known for the psychological insight of his portraits, many of which were considered &quot;cruel&quot; for the truth of the depiction. Lord Leverhulme was so upset with his portrait that he cut out the head (since only that part of the image could easily be hidden in his vault) but when the remainder of the picture was returned by error to John there was an international outcry over the desecration.

By the 1920s John was Britain&#x27;s leading portrait painter. John painted many distinguished contemporaries, including T. E. Lawrence, Thomas Hardy, W. B. Yeats, Aleister Crowley, Lady Gregory, Tallulah Bankhead, George Bernard Shaw, the cellist Guilhermina Suggia, the Marchesa Casati and Elizabeth Bibesco. Perhaps his most famous portrait is of his fellow-countryman, Dylan Thomas, whom he introduced to Caitlin Macnamara, his sometime lover who later became Thomas&#x27;s wife. Portraits of Dylan Thomas by John are held at National Museum Cardiff and the National Portrait Gallery. A commissioned copy of the portrait of T. E. Lawrence was made by Alix Jennings at the request of Jesus College to be its memorial to Lawrence.

It was said that after the war his powers diminished as his bravura technique became sketchier. One critic has claimed that &quot;the painterly brilliance of his early work degenerated into flashiness and bombast, and the second half of his long career added little to his achievement.&quot; However, from time to time his inspiration returned, as it did on a trip to Jamaica in 1937. The works done in Jamaica between March and May 1937 evidence a resurgence of his powers, and amounted to &quot;the St. Martin&#x27;s summer of his creative genius&quot;. In 1944, Sir Bernard Montgomery commissioned a portrait of himself, but rejected the completed work &quot;because it was not like me&quot;; it was subsequently purchased by the Hunterian Art Gallery in Glasgow.

Of his method for painting portraits John explained:
==Family==

On 24 January 1901, John married Ida Nettleship (1877–1907), daughter of the artist John Trivett Nettleship, and a fellow student at the Slade. The couple had five sons: David John (1902–1974)., Caspar John (1903–1984), Robin John (1904–1988), Edwin John (1905–1978), and Henry John (1907–1935). Despite the fact that Nettleship was John&#x27;s wife, housekeeper, and the mother of five of his children, there is not a single mention of her in &quot;Chiaroscuro&quot;, his 1952 memoir. From 1905 until her death in 1907, Ida lived in Paris with John&#x27;s mistress Dorothy &quot;Dorelia&quot; McNeill; a Bohemian style icon, she lived with John for the rest of their lives, having four children together, though they never married. One of his sons (by his wife Ida) was the prominent British Admiral and First Sea Lord Sir Caspar John. His daughter with Dorelia, Vivien John (1915–1994), was a notable painter.

By Ian Fleming&#x27;s widowed mother, Evelyn Ste Croix Fleming, Rose, he had a daughter, Amaryllis Fleming (1925–1999), who became a noted cellist. Another of his sons, by Mavis de Vere Cole, wife of the prankster Horace de Vere Cole, is the television director Tristan de Vere Cole. His son Romilly (1906–1986) was in the RAF, briefly a civil servant, then a poet, author and an amateur physicist. Poppet (1912–1997), John&#x27;s daughter by Dorothy, married the Dutch painter Willem Jilts Pol (1905–1988). Willem Pol&#x27;s daughter Talitha (1940–1971) by an earlier marriage (i.e. step-granddaughter of both Augustus and Dorothy), a fashion icon of 1960s London, married John Paul Getty Jr. His daughter Gwyneth Johnstone (1915–2010), by musician Nora Brownsword, was an artist. Augustus John&#x27;s promiscuity gave rise to rumours that he had fathered as many as 100 children.

In a 1977 interview, Caitlin Thomas was asked about her family&#x27;s friendship with Augustus John and the rumors surrounding his promiscuity. When asked if John &quot;pounced on&quot; her, she replied, &quot;Oh yes, constantly, and on his daughters.&quot;

==Later life==

In later life, John wrote two volumes of autobiography, &quot;Chiaroscuro&quot; (1952) and &quot;Finishing Touches&quot; (1964). In old age, although John had ceased to be a moving force in British art, he was still greatly revered, as was demonstrated by the huge show of his work mounted by the Royal Academy in 1954. He continued to work up until his death in Fordingbridge, Hampshire in 1961, his last work being a studio mural in three parts, the left hand of which showed a Falstaffian figure of a French peasant in a yellow waistcoat playing a hurdy-gurdy while coming down a village street. It was Augustus John&#x27;s final wave goodbye.

He joined the Peace Pledge Union as a pacifist in the 1950s, and was a founder member of the Committee of 100. On 17 September 1961, just over a month before his death, he joined the Committee of 100&#x27;s&#x27;s anti-nuclear weapons demonstration in Trafalgar Square, London. At the time, his son, Admiral Sir Caspar John was First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff. He died at Fordingbridge, aged 83.

He is said to have been the model for the bohemian painter depicted in Joyce Cary&#x27;s novel &quot;The Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, which was later made into a 1958 film of the same name with Alec Guinness in the lead role.

Michael Holroyd published a biography of John in 1975 and it is a mark of the public&#x27;s continued interest in the painter that Holroyd published a new version of the biography in 1996. A major exhibition, &#x27;Gwen John and Augustus John,&#x27; was held at Tate Britain over the winter of 2004/5. According to the gallery&#x27;s publicity, this exhibition revealed &#x27;that although Augustus described himself and his sister as &quot;the same thing, really,&quot; their art developed in different directions. Augustus&#x27; work seems wildly exuberant against Gwen&#x27;s more introverted approach, but both artists indicate a similar flight from the modern world into a realm of fantasy. The exhibition went on to the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff later in 2005. In 2018 Poole Museum in Dorset hosted the exhibition &#x27;Augustus John: Drawn from Life,&#x27; which then went on to Salisbury Museum in 2019.

==Honours and reputation==
Early in his career John became a leading figure in the New English Art Club, where he frequently exhibited in the years up to the First World War. With his vivid manner of portraiture and his ability to catch unerringly some striking and usually unfamiliar aspect of his subject, he superseded Sargent as England&#x27;s fashionable portrait painter. In 1921, he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy and elected a full R.A. in 1928. He was named to the Order of Merit by George VI in 1942. He was a trustee of the Tate Gallery from 1933 to 1941, and President of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters from 1948 to 1953. He was awarded the Freedom of the Town of Tenby on 30 October 1959. On his death in 1961, an obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed, &#x27;He was regarded as the grand old man of British painting, and as one of the greatest in British history.&#x27; 

John&#x27;s granddaughter Rebecca John, the leading authority on her grandfather, said in 2024, while praising his earlier work, that &quot;most [paintings since the 1930s] should have been burned. My grandfather went down the drain from the 1930s onwards, drank too much, lost his judgment, and took every opportunity to earn money from portraits of society ladies and the wives of notable men&quot;.

=== Collections ===

His work is held in the permanent collections of many museums worldwide, including the Museum of New Zealand, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the British Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

<doc id="53505" wikidata="Q181774" url="?curid=53505" title="Ray Milland">
<text>Ray Milland (born Alfred Reginald Jones; 3 January 1907 – 10 March 1986) was a Welsh-American actor and film director. He is often remembered for his portrayal of an alcoholic writer in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945), which won him Best Actor at Cannes, a Golden Globe Award, and ultimately an Academy Award—the first such accolades for any Welsh actor.

Before becoming an actor, Milland served in the Household Cavalry of the British Army, becoming a proficient marksman, horseman and aeroplane pilot. He left the army to pursue a career in acting and appeared as an extra in several British productions before getting his first major role in &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot; (1929). This led to a nine-month contract with MGM, and he moved to the United States, where he worked as a stock actor. After his MGM contract ended, Milland was picked up by Paramount, which used him in a range of lesser speaking parts, usually as an English character. He was lent to Universal for the Deanna Durbin musical &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot; (1936), and its success led to Milland&#x27;s playing the lead role in &quot;The Jungle Princess&quot; (also 1936) alongside new starlet Dorothy Lamour. The film was quite successful and raised both to stardom. Milland remained with Paramount for almost 20 years.

Milland appeared in many other notable films, including &quot;Easy Living&quot; (1937), &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1939), Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Major and the Minor&quot; (1942), opposite a corrupt John Wayne in &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot; (1942), &quot;The Uninvited&quot; (1944), Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Ministry of Fear&quot; (1944), &quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Thief&quot; (1952)—for which he was nominated for his second Golden Globe. Two standout films later in his career include Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954) and &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970). After leaving Paramount, he began directing and moved into television acting. Once Paramount Pictures&#x27; highest-paid actor, Milland co-starred alongside many of the most popular actresses of the time, including Gene Tierney, Jean Arthur, Grace Kelly, Lana Turner, Marlene Dietrich, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, Ginger Rogers, Jane Wyman, Loretta Young, and Veronica Lake.

==Early life==
Milland was born Alfred Reginald Jones on 3 January 1907 in Neath, Wales, the son of Elizabeth Annie (née Truscott) and steel mill superintendent Alfred Jones. He was schooled independently before attending King&#x27;s College School public school in Cardiff. He also worked at his uncle&#x27;s horse-breeding farm before leaving home at the age of 21. Of his parents, he wrote in his 1974 autobiography:

===Household Cavalry===
Prior to becoming an actor, Milland served in the Royal Horse Guards of the Household Cavalry, in 1925. An expert shot, he became a member of his squadron’s rifle team, winning many prestigious competitions, including the Bisley Match in England. He won the British Army Championship in both pistol and rifle marksmanship.

While stationed in London, Milland met dancer Margot St. Leger, and through her was introduced to American actress Estelle Brody. Brody queried Milland&#x27;s commitment to an army career, which led him into buying himself out of the forces in 1928 with the hope of becoming an actor. (According to one account, he was able to support himself with a £17,000 inheritance from his aunt. Another said he was forced to drop out when his father refused to continue subsidising him.)

==Acting career==
===Early appearances===
His first appearance on film was as an uncredited extra on the E.A. Dupont film &quot;Piccadilly&quot; (1929). After some unproductive extra work, which never reached the screen, he signed with a talent agent named Frank Zeitlin on the recommendation of fellow actor Jack Raine.

His prowess as a marksman earned him work as an extra at the British International Pictures studio in Arthur Robison&#x27;s production of &quot;The Informer&quot; (1929), the first screen version of the Liam O&#x27;Flaherty novel. While he was working on &quot;The Informer&quot;, he was asked to test for a production being shot on a neighbouring stage. Milland made a favourable impression on director Castleton Knight, and was hired for his first acting role as Jim Edwards in &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot; (also 1929). In his autobiography, Milland recalls that on this film set, it was suggested that he adopt a stage name; he chose Milland from the &quot;mill lands&quot; area of his Welsh hometown of Neath.

His work on &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot; resulted in him being granted a six-month contract over the course of which Milland starred in two more Knight-directed films, &quot;The Lady from the Sea&quot; and &quot;The Plaything&quot; (both 1929). Believing that his acting was poor, and that he had won his film roles through his looks alone, Milland decided to gain some stage experience to improve his ability. After hearing that club owner Bobby Page was financing a touring company, Milland approached him in hopes of work. He was given the role of second lead in a production of Sam Shipman and Max Marcin&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in Room 13&quot;. Despite being released from the play after five weeks, Milland felt that he had gained valuable acting experience.

===Move to the US, 1930–1932===
In between plays, Milland was approached by MGM vice-president Robert Rubin, who had seen the film &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot;. MGM offered Milland a nine-month contract at $175 a week, based in Hollywood. He accepted, leaving the United Kingdom in August 1930. MGM used Milland as a &#x27;stock&#x27; player, selecting him for small speaking parts in mainstream productions.

Milland&#x27;s first experience in making a Hollywood film resulted in a humiliating scene on the set of &quot;Son of India&quot; (1931), when the film&#x27;s director Jacques Feyder berated Milland&#x27;s acting in front of the entire crew. Despite this setback, the studio executives talked Milland into staying in Hollywood, and in 1930, he appeared in his first US film &quot;Passion Flower&quot;. Over the next two years, Milland appeared in minor parts for MGM and a few films for which he was lent to Warner Bros; he was often uncredited. His largest role during this period was as Charles Laughton&#x27;s nephew in &quot;Payment Deferred&quot; (1932).

While in this first period working in the United States, Milland met Muriel Frances Weber, whom he always called &quot;Mal&quot;, a student at the University of Southern California. Within eight months of first meeting, the two were married. The ceremony took place on 30 September 1932 at the Riverside Mission Inn. The couple had a son, Daniel, and adopted a daughter, Victoria.

Shortly after making &quot;Payment Deferred&quot;, Milland found himself out of work when MGM failed to renew his contract. He spent five months in the US attempting to find further acting work, but after little success and a strained relationship with his father-in-law he decided to head back to Britain, hoping that two years spent in Hollywood would lead to roles in British films. Milland cashed in his contracted first-class return ticket to Britain and found an alternative, cheaper way back home. Muriel remained in the States to finish her studies, and Milland found temporary accommodation in Earl&#x27;s Court in London.

===Return to Britain===
Milland found life in Britain difficult, receiving little regular work, although he finally found parts in two British films, &quot;This Is the Life&quot; and &quot;Orders Is Orders&quot; (both 1933). Neither was a breakthrough role.

===Back in the US and &quot;Bolero&quot;===
Then, in 1933, Roosevelt&#x27;s reforms to the U.S. banking sector led to a temporary weakness in the dollar, allowing Milland to afford a return to the United States. He returned to California, and found a small flat on Sunset Boulevard, promising Muriel that he would buy a home once he was financially stable.

With little prospect of finding acting work, Milland took on menial jobs, including working for a bookie. He decided to find regular employment and through connections made during his time in the UK, he was offered the job of assistant manager of a Shell gas station on Sunset and Clark.

On his return from his successful Shell interview, he passed by the gates of Paramount Pictures, where he was approached by casting director Joe Egli. Paramount was filming the George Raft picture &quot;Bolero&quot; (released in February 1934), but an injury to another British actor had left the studio looking for an urgent replacement. Egli offered Milland a two-week contract, at ten times the salary the assistant job would pay. Milland took the acting role.

After completing &quot;Bolero&quot;, Milland was offered a five-week guarantee by Benjamin Glazer to work on an upcoming screwball comedy starring Bing Crosby and Carole Lombard entitled &quot;We&#x27;re Not Dressing&quot; (also 1934). During filming, he appeared in a scene with George Burns and Gracie Allen, which Milland recalls as falling into an &quot;ad-libbed shambles&quot; that he felt was better than the original script. The film&#x27;s director Norman Taurog was so impressed, he rang the chief production executive and suggested that Milland be placed on a long-term contract. After a short meeting, Milland was offered a seven-year deal with Paramount starting at $175 a week. The contract gave Milland a secure income, and Muriel and he moved into an apartment on Fountain Avenue.

Milland later said &quot;It all happened by luck and I was just there at the right place at the right time.&quot;

===Paramount and &quot;The Jungle Princess&quot;===

During his first contract with Paramount, Milland was used as part of the speaking cast, but never as a top-of-the-bill actor. He had a supporting role, for instance, in the original &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1935) with George Raft.

Milland was lent to Universal for &quot;Next Time We Love&quot; (1936), with Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart. Back at Paramount he was in &quot;The Return of Sophie Lang &quot; (1936) and &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1937&quot; (1936).

He was contacted by Joe Pasternak, who was looking for an &#x27;English&#x27; actor for the lead in his new picture, &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot; (1936). Although Pasternak worked for Universal Studios, Paramount had agreed to lend Milland out for the film.

On returning to Paramount after &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot; was wrapped, Milland was used as a test actor to find a new starlet for &quot;The Jungle Princess&quot; (1936). When the studio chose Dorothy Lamour for the lead, Milland wrote in his autobiography that Lamour was confused to find that he was not to be her male lead and she requested Milland to be her co-star. Paramount was not keen, but when &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot; was pre-released to rave reviews, they gave Milland the role. By the end of 1936, Milland was being considered for leading roles, and Paramount rewrote his contract, resulting in the tripling of his salary.

==Movie star==
===As leading man 1937–1939===
After taking a break in Europe, Milland was cast as Captain Hugh &quot;Bulldog&quot; Drummond in &quot;Bulldog Drummond Escapes&quot; (1937).

Milland was then in &quot;Wings over Honolulu&quot; (1937) with Wendy Barrie, and then in &quot;Easy Living&quot; (1937), a classic comedy with Jean Arthur directed by Mitchell Leisen.

Milland did &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; (1937) with Frances Farmer and was then loaned to RKO for &quot;Wise Girl&quot; (1937) with Miriam Hopkins.

Back at Paramount, Milland was reunited with Lamour in &quot;Her Jungle Love&quot; (1938) and &quot;Tropic Holiday&quot; (1938). He then did a military drama for William Wellman, &quot;Men with Wings&quot; (1938), co-starring Fred MacMurray.

Milland did a comedy, &quot;Say It in French&quot; (1938), and then &quot;Hotel Imperial&quot; (1939) with Marlene Dietrich, during the production of which Milland suffered a near-fatal accident on the set. One scene called for him to lead a cavalry charge through a small village. An accomplished horseman, Milland insisted upon doing this scene himself. As he was making a scripted jump on the horse, his saddle came loose, sending him flying straight into a pile of broken masonry. Milland awoke in hospital, where he remained for a week with a badly damaged left hand, a three-inch gash to his head, and a concussion.

After recovering, he appeared as John Geste in &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1939), alongside Gary Cooper and Robert Preston and directed by Wellman. The film was a huge hit. 20th Century Fox then borrowed him for &quot;Everything Happens at Night&quot; (1939) opposite Sonja Henie.

According to Milland, a second injury to his left hand occurred in 1939. As well as horse-riding, Milland enjoyed piloting aircraft and in his early career would lease single-seater planes. As a contracted starring actor, Paramount had insisted he give up this hobby. Instead, Milland took up woodworking and outfitted a machine shop at the back of his newly built house. While operating a circular saw, he slipped, catching one of his hands on the saw. The injury resulted in Milland losing a part of his thumb and severely damaging his tendons.

Milland believed that the injury left him with only 50% usage of his hand, but within weeks of the incident, he flew to Britain to star in &quot;French Without Tears&quot;. By the time he returned to America, war was declared in Europe. The year finished with the news that Muriel was pregnant with their son Daniel.

===World War II===
In 1940, Milland appeared in a selection of romantic comedies and dramas alongside some of the leading ladies of the time. These included &quot;Irene&quot; opposite Anna Neagle, &quot;The Doctor Takes a Wife&quot; opposite Loretta Young at Columbia, &quot;Arise, My Love&quot; opposite Claudette Colbert, and &quot;Untamed&quot; opposite Patricia Morison. He was a last minute replacement for Joel McCrea on &quot;Arise&quot; which meant he had to drop out of another film, &quot;Virginia&quot;.

When the United States entered World War II, Milland tried to enlist in the U.S. Army Air Forces, but was rejected because of his impaired left hand. He worked as a civilian flight instructor for the Army, and toured with a United Service Organisation South Pacific troupe in 1944.

As the Second World War continued, Milland found himself now appearing in more action pictures. He starred as a wannabe pilot in &quot;I Wanted Wings&quot; (1941) with Brian Donlevy, Veronica Lake, and William Holden. This was followed by &quot;Skylark&quot; (1942) with Claudette Colbert, and two films with Paulette Goddard: &quot;The Lady Has Plans&quot; (1942) and Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot; (1942) alongside John Wayne, in which he was top billed above Wayne.

Milland starred in &quot;Are Husbands Necessary?&quot; (1942) and subsequently Billy Wilder&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;The Major and the Minor&quot; (1942) opposite Ginger Rogers.

Milland appeared in the all-star musical &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; (1943), in which he appeared as himself, singing &quot;If Men Played Cards as Women Do,&quot; alongside Fred MacMurray, Franchot Tone, and Lynne Overman. He also made an appearance in the collaborative drama, &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943).

He and Goddard then made &quot;The Crystal Ball&quot; (1943); thereafter, he was Ginger Rogers&#x27; leading man in &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; (1944).

In 1944, Milland starred in the supernatural horror film, &quot;The Uninvited&quot;, which was notable for its serious treatment of ghosts and haunting main theme, and for making a star of Gail Russell. He then starred in Fritz Lang&#x27;s film noir production of Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;Ministry of Fear&quot; (also 1944).

He also toured war theatres with USO Shows. At one performance a soldier heckled him, asking why he was not in the army. Milland replied, &quot;With a war on? Are you crazy?&quot;

===&quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;, 1945===
The pinnacle of Milland&#x27;s career and acknowledgment of his serious dramatic abilities came when he starred in &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945). Milland recalled how after returning from an emcee engagement in Peru, he found a book delivered to his home, with a note from Paramount&#x27;s head of production Buddy DeSylva that read, &quot;Read it. Study it. You&#x27;re going to play it.&quot; Milland found the book unsettling and felt its subject matter, that of an alcoholic writer, to be challenging and alien to him. He was also concerned that it would require &#x27;serious acting&#x27;, something that he believed he had not undertaken up to that point in his career. The film was to be produced by Charles Brackett and directed by Billy Wilder; the pair were also collaborating to write the screenplay. Milland had already worked with both men, having starred in the comedy &quot;The Major and the Minor&quot; (1942), and he was excited by their involvement.

Milland&#x27;s main concern with taking on the role of Don Birnam in &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; was that he might overact and look amateurish. After a shambolic attempt to act parts of the script while actually drunk, Milland quickly realized that he needed to understand alcoholism. After the cast and crew had arrived on location in New York, Milland was allowed to spend a night in a psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital, where the patients were suffering from alcoholism and delirium tremens. He found the experience extremely disturbing and left at three in the morning. Milland lost eight pounds for the role and spoke with the book&#x27;s author, Charles R. Jackson, to gain insight into the illness. After the external shots in New York were complete, in which hidden cameras were used to capture Milland walking the streets, the crew returned to Hollywood. Milland found the set work far more challenging, knowing that the close-ups would give his acting no place to hide. Between the strain of acting and the morbidity of the subject, Milland&#x27;s home life deteriorated and he left for a period of two weeks. When the shoot was over, Muriel and he left for a vacation in Canada. He later said that his role in &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; &quot;was the only part [he was] really proud of.&quot;

Returning to filming, Milland was assigned to a Mitchell Leisen-directed historical drama called &quot;Kitty&quot; (1945), opposite Paulette Goddard. He was meant to follow it with &quot;Olympia&quot;.

Instead, he did a romantic comedy, &quot;The Well-Groomed Bride&quot; opposite Olivia de Havilland. Many of the crew members on &quot;The Well-Groomed Bride&quot; had also worked on &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;, and Milland recalled an encounter with a sound mixer, who told him that he had seen a rough cut of &quot;Weekend&quot; and thought Milland was not only sure to be nominated for an Academy Award, but that he would probably win. Milland had not considered himself worthy of an award, but over the next few months, he thought of little else, and was desperate to be nominated. After the first preview, reaction was mixed, but Brackett stated that they had produced &quot;something really worthwhile&quot;. Milland found the initial feedback to his role congratulatory but hushed, leading him to feel that the film would bomb as a piece of cinema and would be seen as a social document. When the film was released in New York, the favourable reviews took both Milland and the studio by surprise. Milland was lauded, and he not only won that year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Actor, but also the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor–Drama, the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor, the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor. He was the first Welsh actor to win an Oscar, and when he collected the award from Ingrid Bergman, he gave one of the shortest acceptance speeches of any Oscar winner. His performance was so convincing, Milland was beleaguered for years by rumours that he actually was an alcoholic. He steadfastly asserted that he was not.

Milland&#x27;s success in &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; resulted in his contract being rewritten, and he became Paramount&#x27;s highest-salaried actor. When the film was premiered across Europe, Milland was sent to attend each opening. When he appeared in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales, he was given the keys to the city.

===1945–1950===
Milland continued working as a leading man after his Oscar win, and stayed contracted to Paramount until the early 1950s. He was teamed with Teresa Wright in &quot;The Imperfect Lady&quot; (1946), directed by Lewis Allen. He replaced Alan Ladd in a Western with Barbara Stanwyck, &quot;California&quot; (1947), directed by John Farrow, which was a big hit.

Milland was reunited with Wright in &quot;The Trouble with Women&quot; (1947) and then starred opposite Marlene Dietrich in &quot;Golden Earrings&quot; (1947). He was one of many Paramount stars who made a cameo in &quot;Variety Girl&quot; (1947) then went to England to make &quot;So Evil My Love&quot; (1948), produced by Hal Wallis for director Lewis Allen.

Milland made a second film for Farrow, &quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1948), which has become one of his most highly regarded films. He then did his third film with Allen, &quot;Sealed Verdict&quot; (1948), and a third with Farrow, &quot;Alias Nick Beal&quot; (1949), which Milland later said was his favourite film.

In July 1948, Paramount suspended him for refusing a part in &quot;The Mark of Lucretia&quot; (which became &quot;The Bride of Vengeance&quot;). Milland commented, &quot;it is a part that is out of my normal natural range as an actor.&quot;

Milland then went to Fox for the comedy, &quot;It Happens Every Spring&quot; (1949), and then made a fourth film with Farrow, &quot;Copper Canyon&quot; (1950). After this, Milland increasingly freelanced.

===Other studios===

At Columbia, Milland starred opposite Rosalind Russell in &quot;A Woman of Distinction&quot; (1950). Then, at MGM, he was directed by George Cukor in &quot;A Life of Her Own&quot; (1950) alongside Lana Turner, replacing Wendell Corey, who had quit the film just three days into filming.

Milland was directed by Jacques Tourneur in RKO&#x27;s &quot;Circle of Danger&quot; (1951); set in the United Kingdom, it was the only time he filmed in his home country of Wales. At MGM he was in &quot;Night Into Morning&quot; (1951) and then a comedy, &quot;Rhubarb&quot; (1951).

Milland gave a strong performance in &quot;Close to My Heart&quot; (1951) at Warner Bros, in which he and Gene Tierney starred as a couple trying to adopt a child. His next film, &quot;Bugles in the Afternoon&quot; (1952), also at Warners, was a Western. He played in &quot;Something to Live For&quot; (1952), another study of alcoholism at Paramount, with Joan Fontaine.

Milland had a contract to make one film a year with Paramount (who released Pine-Thomas films). He was wanted by producer Harold Popkin to make &quot;The Thief&quot; but Paramount insisted he make &quot;Jamaica Run&quot; under their contract instead. The impasse was resolved by the intervention of Milland&#x27;s agents at MCA and filming for &quot;Jamaica Run&quot; was pushed back. For &quot;The Thief&quot; (1952), his role was without dialogue, and he was nominated for a second Golden Globe. He later remarked that he was proud of the film.

After &quot;Jamaica Run&quot; (1953), Milland went to Columbia for &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; (1953) with Jane Wyman.

He then starred opposite Grace Kelly and Robert Cummings in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954), originally shot in three dimensions. Although never admitted by either, rumours were rife at the time that Kelly and Milland were engaged in an affair, fuelled by notorious gossip columnist Hedda Hopper.

He starred with Phyllis Avery and Lloyd Corrigan in the CBS sitcom, &quot;Meet Mr. McNutley,&quot; from 1953 to 1955. He appeared in the role of an English and Drama professor at the fictitious Lynnhaven College. The sitcom was renamed &quot;The Ray Milland Show&quot; in its second season. Milland directed some episodes, and he soon had ambitions to direct features.

At Fox, Milland starred in &quot;The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing&quot; (1955). then starred in a TV adaptation of &quot;Markheim&quot; (1956) directed by Fred Zinnemann.

==Director==

After leaving Paramount, Milland concentrated on directing. In his first directorial effort, a Western entitled &quot;A Man Alone&quot; (1955), Milland cast himself in the leading role. His co-stars included Mary Murphy and Ward Bond. The story depicts the aftermath of a stagecoach robbery. He did the film for a lesser fee in exchange for a chance to direct and a percentage of the profits

He then starred in and directed &quot;Lisbon&quot; (1956), alongside Maureen O&#x27;Hara and Claude Rains. Like &quot;A Man Alone,&quot; it was distributed by Republic Pictures and filmed in Trucolor.

He directed episodes of &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot; and &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot; and starred in the features &quot;Three Brave Men&quot; (1956), &quot;The River&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1957), a Western directed by Allan Dwan for Benedict Bogeaus, and &quot;High Flight&quot; (1957), an air force melodrama for Warwick Pictures in England.

He appeared in episodes of &quot;Suspicion&quot; and &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, directing episodes of both. His third feature as director was &quot;The Safecracker&quot; (1958), which was shot in England.

==Later career==
===Retirement and &quot;Markham&quot;===
Milland then retired for six months before deciding to go back to work, commenting, &quot;my wife told me I&#x27;d better get a job of some kind because I was making her a nervous wreck ... hanging around the house.&quot;

From 1958 to 1960, Milland starred in the CBS detective series, &quot;Markham&quot;, originally called &quot;Crisis&quot;.

During the making of the show Milland remarked, &quot;it&#x27;s becoming more and more of an effort to go on acting. I know it&#x27;s a wonderful way to make a living but any job you don&#x27;t like becomes difficult and I just don&#x27;t like acting. I never have. I do it because I can&#x27;t make a living any other way. Standing in front of a crew playing love scenes embarasses me. I&#x27;m as self conscious as hell and I want to get it over with. You get up too early and you finish too late and you feel like a lackey.&quot;

The show failed to capture the expected significant audience, even though it followed the western &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.
He retired again, this time to the French Riviera in 1960. However, he soon became bored and started acting again.

===AIP===
Milland appeared in two Roger Corman AIP pictures. The first was &quot;The Premature Burial&quot; (1962) – the third of Corman&#x27;s &#x27;Poe Cycle&#x27;. He then portrayed Dr. Xavier in the well-received &quot;&quot; (1963).

Also for AIP, he starred in the self-directed, apocalyptic science-fiction drama, &quot;Panic in Year Zero!&quot; (1962).

He continued to guest star on shows like &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour,&quot; and he appeared in &quot;Quick, Let&#x27;s Get Married &quot;(1964).

===Broadway===
Milland decided to return to the stage and in 1964 appeared as Higgins in a touring version of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, with mezzo soprano Marilyn Savage as Eliza Doolittle. He enjoyed the experience and in 1966 took the lead role as Simon Crawford QC in the Broadway play, &quot;Hostile Witness&quot;, directed by Reginald Denham.

The play ran in New York from February until July of that year, after which Milland took the play on the road. In 1968, he reprised the role in a film of the same title, which he also directed. It was the last feature film he directed.

===Character actor===
He returned as a character actor in the late 1960s and the 1970s, appearing in such films as &quot;Daughter of the Mind&quot; (1969), a television film that reunited him with Gene Tierney.

In the late 1960s, Milland hosted rebroadcasts of certain episodes of the syndicated Western anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days,&quot; under the title &quot;Trails West&quot;; the series&#x27; original host had been Ronald Reagan. He also guest-starred on &quot;Bracken&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; as well as in TV movies like &quot;Company of Killers&quot; (1970), &quot;River of Gold&quot; (1971) and &quot;Black Noon&quot; (1971).

Milland had his biggest box office success in many years when he played Oliver Barrett III in &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970). In 1978 Milland reprised his role as Oliver Barrett III in &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot;, also written by Erich Segal.

He was then in &quot;Embassy&quot; (1972), a British spy thriller.

In 1970, he said he worked only two to three months a year acting and spent the rest of the year relaxing, although he admitted that he had suffered some financial troubles since the sale of his yacht in 1964.

===Horror and action movies; focus on television===
In 1972, Milland starred in two horror films. One was &quot;Frogs&quot;, co-starring Sam Elliott and Joan Van Ark, in which Milland played a wealthy, cantankerous plantation owner who dumps waste materials in a swamp, causing an enormous disruption of nature. The second, &quot;The Thing with Two Heads&quot;, a blaxploitation film directed by Lee Frost, is considered a cult classic; Milland plays a brain surgeon with a terminal illness who transplants his head onto the healthy body of an American prisoner. The following year he was in &quot;The House in Nightmare Park&quot; (1973), a comedy chiller, and had the lead in the TV movie, &quot;Terror in the Wax Museum&quot; (1973).

He also turned in an appearance as a hand surgeon in the &quot;Night Gallery&quot; episode, &quot;The Hand of Borgus Weems&quot;. He guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;Columbo&quot;, as a grieving widower in &quot;Death Lends a Hand&quot; (1971) and as a suspect in &quot;The Greenhouse Jungle&quot; (1972).

Milland was in such action films as: &quot;The Big Game&quot; (1974), &quot;The Student Connection&quot; (1974), and &quot;Gold&quot; opposite Roger Moore (1974). Then he did another TV horror film, &quot;The Dead Don&#x27;t Die&quot; (1975). He appeared in &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot; (1975) for Disney and guest starred on shows like &quot;Cool Million&quot; and &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;.

Around this time, Milland said that he planned on moving to Europe and that he accepted &quot;the parts I figure I can get some enjoyment out of.&quot;

In 1975, Milland was the subject of an episode of the British biographical TV series, &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

Milland had a significant success with the TV miniseries, &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (1976), receiving an Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

He also had roles in &quot;The Swiss Conspiracy&quot; (1976), &quot;Aces High&quot; (1976), &quot;Look What&#x27;s Happened to Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1976), &quot;Mayday at 40,000 Feet!&quot; (1976), &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; (1976), &quot;Seventh Avenue&quot; (1976), &quot;Oil&quot; (1977), &quot;Testimony of Two Men&quot; (1977), &quot;The Uncanny&quot; (1977), &quot;Slavers&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Pyjama Girl Case&quot; (1978), an Italian giallo set in Australia.

He starred in &quot;Cruise Into Terror&quot; (1978), &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Blackout&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Darker Side of Terror&quot; (1979).

He guest-starred as Sire Uri in &quot;Saga of a Star World&quot; (1978&quot;)&quot;, the pilot episode of the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; television series. He reprised his role as Ryan O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s father in &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; (1978) and appeared in some action films, including &quot;Spree&quot; (1979) and &quot;Game for Vultures&quot; (1979).

Milland guest-starred on several Aaron Spelling-produced shows such as &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;. In the latter, he appeared twice as Jennifer Hart&#x27;s father.

He was top billed in &quot;The Attic&quot; (1980), but usually had supporting roles in TV movies like &quot;The Dream Merchants&quot; (1980), &quot;Our Family Business&quot; (1981), &quot;The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana&quot; (1982), &quot;&quot; (1983), &quot;Cave In!&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Masks of Death&quot; (1984), a Sherlock Holmes adventure starring Peter Cushing and John Mills.

His last appearances were in &quot;The Sea Serpent&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Gold Key&quot; (1985). The latter was a mystery made specifically for video.

== Personal life ==
Milland was married to Muriel Frances Weber from 30 September 1932 until his death on 10 March 1986. They had one biological son and one adopted daughter. Their son, Daniel, appeared in several minor acting roles in the 1960s and died of an apparent suicide in March 1981, at the age of 41.

Milland became a naturalised American citizen in the 1940s. He supported the Republican Party and publicly backed Thomas E. Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election
as well as Richard Nixon in the 1968 presidential election.

==Death==
Milland died of lung cancer at the Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, California, on 10 March 1986. He was 79 years old. In line with his instructions, no funeral was held.

<doc id="53506" wikidata="Q202749" url="?curid=53506" title="Edmond Rostand">
<text>Edmond Eugène Alexis Rostand (, , ; 1 April 1868 – 2 December 1918) was a French poet and dramatist. He is associated with neo-romanticism and is known best for his 1897 play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. Rostand&#x27;s romantic plays contrasted with the naturalistic theatre popular during the late nineteenth century. Another of Rostand&#x27;s works, &quot;Les Romanesques&quot; (1894), was adapted to the 1960 musical comedy &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;.

==Early life==
Rostand was born in Marseille, France, into a wealthy and cultured Provençal family. His father was an economist, a poet who translated and edited the works of Catullus, and a member of the Marseille Academy and the Institut de France. Rostand studied literature, history, and philosophy at the Collège Stanislas in Paris, France.

==Career==
When Rostand was twenty years old, his first play, a one-act comedy, &quot;Le Gant rouge&quot;, was performed at the Cluny Theatre, 24 August 1888, but it was almost unnoticed.

He and his fiancée Rosemonde Gérard became friends with Emmanuel Chabrier in 1889, and the composer quickly set three of his poems (and two of hers) to music; the following year the two collaborated on &quot;À la musique&quot; for the house-warming of a mutual friend. In 1890, Rostand published a volume of poems called &quot;Les Musardises&quot;. The same year he offered a one-act Pierrot play in verse to the director of the Théâtre François. This gave him the opportunity to write for the state theatre a three-act play, also in verse, as are all Rostand&#x27;s plays. He considered himself a poet, whether writing plays or poetry.

The resulting play, &quot;Les Romanesques&quot;, was produced at the Théâtre François on 21 May 1894. It was a great success and was the start of his career as a dramatist. This play would be adapted in 1960 by Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt into the long-running American musical &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;.

Rostand&#x27;s next play was written for Sarah Bernhardt. &quot;La Princesse Lointaine&quot; was based on the story of the 12th-century troubadour Jaufre Rudel and his love for Hodierna of Jerusalem (who is the archetypal princesse lointaine character). This idealistic play opened on 5 April 1895, at the Théâtre de la Renaissance. The part of Melisandre (based on Hodierna&#x27;s daughter Melisende of Tripoli) was created by Sarah Bernhardt but the play was not particularly successful. When Bernhardt performed it in London later the same year, it received a bad review from George Bernard Shaw but this was not surprising considering Shaw&#x27;s bias for realism. &quot;Rambaldo di Vaqueiras: I Monferrato&quot;, 1922 1922 verse drama by Nino Berrini is based on &quot;La Princesse Lointaine&quot;.

Bernhardt, undeterred, asked Rostand to write another play for her. She created the role of Photine in &quot;La Samaritaine&quot; (Theatre de la Renaissance, 14 April 1897), a Biblical drama in three scenes adapted from the gospel story of the woman of Samaria. This play was more successful and became part of Sarah Bernhardt&#x27;s repertoire. Rostand felt satisfied that he had proven to the public that he was something more than a writer of comedies.

 The production of his heroic comedy &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (28 December 1897, Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin), with Benoît-Constant Coquelin in the title role, was a triumph. The first production lasted for more than 300 consecutive nights. No such enthusiasm for a drama in verse had been known since the time of Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Hernani&quot;. The play was quickly translated into English, German, Russian and other European languages. Cyrano de Bergerac had been a boyhood hero of Rostand, who loved his idealism and courage. He had also thoroughly researched French 17th-century history.

The play &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; was written for Sarah Bernhardt to perform during the Exposition Universelle in Paris. A patriotic subject was required, and Rostand chose a subject from Napoleonic history, suggested probably by Henri Welschinger&#x27;s &quot;Roi de Rome, 1811–32&quot; (1897), which contained much new information about the unhappy life of the Duke of Reichstadt, son of Napoleon I, and Marie Louise, surveilled by agents of Metternich at the Schönbrunn Palace. &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;, a verse drama in six acts, was produced (15 March 1900) by Sarah Bernhardt at her own theatre, she herself performing the trouser role of the Duke of Reichstadt.

In 1901, Rostand became the youngest writer ever to be elected to the Académie française. He relocated to Cambo-les-bains, in the Basque Pyrenees, in 1903 for health reasons. Here he built himself a villa, Arnaga (now a Rostand museum) and worked on his next play, one for Constant Coquelin this time, &quot;Chantecler&quot;. Produced in February 1910, it was awaited with an interest, enhanced by considerable delay in the production, which affected the enthusiasm of its reception. Nor did the Parisian audience enjoy the caricature of salon life in the third act. Since Constant Coquelin had died during rehearsals, Lucien Guitry was in the title role and Mme. Simone played the part of the pheasant. Chantecler is a cockerel and the characters are birds and animals. &quot;Chantecler&quot; is the great play of Rostand&#x27;s maturity, expressing Rostand&#x27;s own deepest feelings as a poet and idealist.

The Romancers one act play is one of Edmond Rostand&#x27;s most famous plays. This play is found to be read for study in the courses of many universities of the world.

When he died prematurely at fifty years old, Rostand was still writing plays. &quot;La Dernière Nuit de Don Juan&quot; was performed posthumously in 1922. There were two unfinished and unpublished plays – &quot;Yorick&quot; and &quot;Les Petites Manies&quot;.

==Personal life==

Rostand was married to the poet and playwright Rosemonde-Étiennette Gérard who, in 1890, published &quot;Les Pipeaux&quot;: a volume of verse commended by the Academy. The couple had two sons, Jean and Maurice.

During the 1900s, Rostand came to live in the Villa Arnaga in Cambo-les-Bains in the French Basque Country, seeking a cure for his pleurisy. The house is now a heritage site and a museum of Rostand&#x27;s life and Basque architecture and crafts. Rostand died in 1918, a victim of the flu pandemic, and is buried in the Cimetière de Marseille.

<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, group objects are certain generalizations of groups that are built on more complicated structures than sets. A typical example of a group object is a topological group, a group whose underlying set is a topological space such that the group operations are continuous.

==Definition==

Formally, we start with a category &quot;C&quot; with finite products (i.e. &quot;C&quot; has a terminal object 1 and any two objects of &quot;C&quot; have a product). A group object in &quot;C&quot; is an object &quot;G&quot; of &quot;C&quot; together with morphisms
*&quot;m&quot; : &quot;G&quot; × &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot; (thought of as the &quot;group multiplication&quot;)
*&quot;e&quot; : 1 → &quot;G&quot; (thought of as the &quot;inclusion of the identity element&quot;)
*&quot;inv&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot; (thought of as the &quot;inversion operation&quot;)
such that the following properties (modeled on the group axioms – more precisely, on the definition of a group used in universal algebra) are satisfied
* &quot;m&quot; is associative, i.e. &quot;m&quot; (&quot;m&quot; × id&quot;G&quot;) = &quot;m&quot; (id&quot;G&quot; × &quot;m&quot;) as morphisms &quot;G&quot; × &quot;G&quot; × &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot;, and where e.g. &quot;m&quot; × id&quot;G&quot; : &quot;G&quot; × &quot;G&quot; × &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot; × &quot;G&quot;; here we identify &quot;G&quot; × (&quot;G&quot; × &quot;G&quot;) in a canonical manner with (&quot;G&quot; × &quot;G&quot;) × &quot;G&quot;. 
* &quot;e&quot; is a two-sided unit of &quot;m&quot;, i.e. &quot;m&quot; (id&quot;G&quot; × &quot;e&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;1, where &quot;p&quot;1 : &quot;G&quot; × 1 → &quot;G&quot; is the canonical projection, and &quot;m&quot; (&quot;e&quot; × id&quot;G&quot;) = &quot;p&quot;2, where &quot;p&quot;2 : 1 × &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot; is the canonical projection
* &quot;inv&quot; is a two-sided inverse for &quot;m&quot;, i.e. if &quot;d&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot; × &quot;G&quot; is the diagonal map, and &quot;e&quot;&quot;G&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot; is the composition of the unique morphism &quot;G&quot; → 1 (also called the counit) with &quot;e&quot;, then &quot;m&quot; (id&quot;G&quot; × &quot;inv&quot;) &quot;d&quot; = &quot;e&quot;&quot;G&quot; and &quot;m&quot; (&quot;inv&quot; × id&quot;G&quot;) &quot;d&quot; = &quot;e&quot;&quot;G&quot;.

Note that this is stated in terms of maps – product and inverse must be maps in the category – and without any reference to underlying &quot;elements&quot; of the group object – categories in general do not have elements of their objects.

Another way to state the above is to say &quot;G&quot; is a group object in a category &quot;C&quot; if for every object &quot;X&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, there is a group structure on the morphisms Hom(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;G&quot;) from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;G&quot; such that the association of &quot;X&quot; to Hom(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;G&quot;) is a (contravariant) functor from &quot;C&quot; to the category of groups.

== Examples ==
* Each set &quot;G&quot; for which a group structure (&quot;G&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, −1) can be defined can be considered a group object in the category of sets. The map &quot;m&quot; is the group operation, the map &quot;e&quot; (whose domain is a singleton) picks out the identity element &quot;u&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, and the map &quot;inv&quot; assigns to every group element its inverse. &quot;e&quot;&quot;G&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot; is the map that sends every element of &quot;G&quot; to the identity element.
* A topological group is a group object in the category of topological spaces with continuous functions.
* A Lie group is a group object in the category of smooth manifolds with smooth maps.
* A Lie supergroup is a group object in the category of supermanifolds.
* An algebraic group is a group object in the category of algebraic varieties. In modern algebraic geometry, one considers the more general group schemes, group objects in the category of schemes.
* A localic group is a group object in the category of locales.
* The group objects in the category of groups (or monoids) are the abelian groups. The reason for this is that, if &quot;inv&quot; is assumed to be a homomorphism, then &quot;G&quot; must be abelian. More precisely: if &quot;A&quot; is an abelian group and we denote by &quot;m&quot; the group multiplication of &quot;A&quot;, by &quot;e&quot; the inclusion of the identity element, and by &quot;inv&quot; the inversion operation on &quot;A&quot;, then (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;inv&quot;) is a group object in the category of groups (or monoids). Conversely, if (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;inv&quot;) is a group object in one of those categories, then &quot;m&quot; necessarily coincides with the given operation on &quot;A&quot;, &quot;e&quot; is the inclusion of the given identity element on &quot;A&quot;, &quot;inv&quot; is the inversion operation and &quot;A&quot; with the given operation is an abelian group. See also Eckmann–Hilton argument.
* The strict 2-group is the group object in the category of small categories.
* Given a category &quot;C&quot; with finite coproducts, a cogroup object is an object &quot;G&quot; of &quot;C&quot; together with a &quot;comultiplication&quot; &quot;m&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot; formula_1 &quot;G,&quot; a &quot;coidentity&quot; &quot;e&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → 0, and a &quot;coinversion&quot; &quot;inv&quot;: &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot; that satisfy the dual versions of the axioms for group objects. Here 0 is the initial object of &quot;C&quot;. Cogroup objects occur naturally in algebraic topology.
