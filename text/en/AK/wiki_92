<text>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (; ; born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest cricketers of all time, and is the holder of several world records, including being the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket, receiving the most player of the match awards in international cricket, and being the only batsman to score 100 international centuries. Tendulkar was a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha by presidential nomination from 2012 to 2018. 

Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for over 24 years. In 2002, halfway through his career, &quot;Wisden&quot; ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. The same year, Tendulkar was a part of the team that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India. He had previously been named &quot;Player of the Tournament&quot; at the 2003 World Cup.

Tendulkar has received several awards from the government of India: the Arjuna Award (1994), the Khel Ratna Award (1997), the Padma Shri (1998), and the Padma Vibhushan (2008). After Tendulkar played his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian award. He was the first sportsperson to receive the award and, , is the youngest recipient. In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; included Tendulkar in its annual list of the most influential people in the world. Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 International Cricket Council (ICC) Awards.

Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012, he retired from all forms of cricket in November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match. Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs. In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, and he was one of only two specialist batsmen of the post–World War II era, along with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team. In 2019, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

== Early life and background ==
Tendulkar was born at the Nirmal Nursing Home in the Dadar neighbourhood of Bombay, Maharashtra on 24 April 1973 into a Maharastrian family. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a Marathi-language novelist and poet while his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry. Tendulkar&#x27;s father named him after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three older siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were his father&#x27;s children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child. His brother Ajit played in Bombay&#x27;s Kanga Cricket League.

Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and he often picked fights with new children in his school.

As a child, Tendulkar was interested in both tennis and cricket. He particularly idolised American player John McEnroe, and emulated his hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years. At this time, Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands and carried a tennis racquet with him as a sign of his love for tennis.

To help curb his bullying tendencies, his elder brother Ajit introduced Tendulkar to cricket in 1984. Ajit introduced him to cricket coach Ramakant Achrekar at Shivaji Park in Dadar. At their first meeting, Tendulkar did not play well. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Tendulkar, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar&#x27;s academy.

Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar&#x27;s talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir School, a school in Dadar that had produced many notable cricketers. He made his debut as a cricketer for Sharadashram in late 1984. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society&#x27;s New English School in Bandra (East). He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings. Tendulkar would practice for hours; if he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar completed the session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar considers the 13 coins he won among his most prized possessions. While he was training at Shivaji Park, he moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near the park.

Besides school cricket, Tendulkar also played club cricket. In 1984, at age 11, he debuted in the Kanga Cricket League while playing for the John Bright Cricket Club. Beginning in 1988, he played for the Cricket Club of India.

In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but the trainer, Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, was unimpressed and suggested that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead. On 20 January 1987, he was a substitute for Imran Khan&#x27;s side in an exhibition match at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay. A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave Tendulkar a pair of his own lightweight pads and told him to not get disheartened for not receiving the Bombay Cricket Association&#x27;s Best Junior Cricketer Award. Of this experience, Tendulkar later said, &quot;It was the greatest source of encouragement for me&quot;. Tendulkar served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay.

In 1988, while playing for Sharadashram, Tendulkar and Vinod Kambli batted in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier&#x27;s High School. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in that match and scored over 1,000 runs in the tournament. This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two junior cricketers in Hyderabad, India.

== Early career ==
On 14 November 1987, at age 14, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for the 1987–88 season, but he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder. A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede Stadium and scored 100 (not out) in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket. He was selected to play for the team by Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar, who watched him play Kapil Dev in Wankhede Stadium&#x27;s cricket practice nets, where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. Tendulkar followed this by scoring a century each in his Deodhar and Duleep Trophy debuts, which are also India&#x27;s domestic cricket tournaments.

Tendulkar finished the 1988–89 Ranji Trophy season as Bombay&#x27;s highest run-scorer. He scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77 and was the eighth-highest run-scorer overall. In both 1988 and 1989, he was picked for a young Indian team to tour England under the Star Cricket Club banner. In the 1990–91 Ranji Trophy final, which Bombay narrowly lost to Haryana, Tendulkar&#x27;s 96 from 75 balls was key to giving Bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.

At the start of the 1989–90 season, while playing for Rest of India, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten century in an Irani Trophy match against Delhi.

In the final of 1995 Ranji Trophy, Tendulkar, captaining Bombay, scored 140 and 139 versus Punjab.

In the 1995–96 Irani Cup, he captained Mumbai against Rest of India. His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998. He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies). Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.

In total, Tendulkar was part of five Ranji Trophy finals, in which Mumbai won 4.

===County cricket===
In 1992, at the age of 19, Tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent Yorkshire, which, prior to Tendulkar joining the team, never selected players, even UK-based, from outside Yorkshire. Selected for Yorkshire as a replacement for the injured Australian fast bowler Craig McDermott, Tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the team and scored 1,070 runs at an average of 46.52.

== Career ==
=== Early tours ===
Raj Singh Dungarpur is credited for the selection of Tendulkar for the Indian tour of Pakistan in late 1989, after one first class season. The Indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting Tendulkar for the tour of the West Indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the West Indies so early in his career.

Tendulkar was the youngest player to debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days, and also the youngest player to debut for India in ODI at the age of 16 years and 238 days. Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. He scored 15 runs, being bowled by Waqar Younis, who also made his debut in that match. He was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the Pakistani pace attack. In the fourth and final Test match in Sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by Younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he his nose gushed blood. In a 20-over exhibition game in Peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, Tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs bowled by leg-spinner Abdul Qadir. This was later called &quot;one of the best innings I have seen&quot; by the then Indian captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth. In all, Tendulkar scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the Test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only One Day International (ODI) he played.

The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in Tests. He was dismissed without scoring in one of the two ODI games he played, and scored 36 in the other. On a 1990 tour to England, on 14 August, he became the second-youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out in the second Test at Old Trafford in Manchester. &quot;Wisden&quot; described his innings as &quot;a disciplined display of immense maturity&quot; and also wrote, &quot;He looked the embodiment of India&#x27;s famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen&quot;.

Tendulkar&#x27;s reputation grew during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup. During the tour, he scored an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in Australia. He then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack from Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid, and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that &quot;This little prick&#x27;s going to get more runs than you, AB.&quot;

=== Rise through the ranks ===

==== 1994–96: ODI matches ====
Tendulkar opened the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo. He competed in 78 ODIs before scoring his first century.
Tendulkar&#x27;s rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries. He was the only Indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, Clive Lloyd, awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.

After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat. Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over. India went on to win that match. It enabled India to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI.

==== 1998: Australian competition ====
Tendulkar scored 143 (131) runs in Sharjah against the Australian team in the 1998 Coca-Cola cup, including 5 sixes in an innings against Shane Warne, Damien Fleming and Michael Kasprowicz. The innings is known as the &quot;Desert Storm&quot; because it was interrupted by a sand storm. In 2020, a poll from the ICC declared it Tendulkar&#x27;s best ODI innings.

In early 1998, while playing in an Australian tour of India, Tendulkar scored three consecutive centuries. The focus of the tour was the clash between Tendulkar and spinner Shane Warne, both at the peak of their careers. In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan. In their tour opener, Australia faced Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match. Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 204 runs as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days. He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs. The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah—the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia. These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings. Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.

Tendulkar&#x27;s contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India&#x27;s entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.

==== 1999: Asian Test Championship, Test matches, and the World Cup ====
The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Around 100,000 attended the first four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record. In the first match, between India and Pakistan at Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was dismissed from the match after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. The crowd reacted by throwing objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200 people. Tendulkar scored his 19th Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka. India did not progress to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate in the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship due to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.

In a Test match against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Tendulkar scored 136 runs; India lost the match by 12 runs.

Tendulkar&#x27;s father, Ramesh Tendulkar, died during the 1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against Zimbabwe. He returned to the World Cup, scoring a century (140 not out of 101 balls) in his very next match against Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated the century to his father.

=== Captaincy of national team ===

Tendulkar&#x27;s two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. Tendulkar became captain in 1996, but by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Discussing Tendulkar&#x27;s first term as captain, Azharuddin was credited with saying, &quot;He won&#x27;t win! It&#x27;s not in the small one&#x27;s destiny!&quot; ()

Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, led India on a tour of Australia, where the visitors were beaten 3–0 by the newly crowned world champions. Tendulkar won the player of the series award, as well as player of the match in one of the games. After another Test series defeat, this time by a 0–2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned, and Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.

==== South Africa match fixing ====
In 2000, members of the South African national team attempted to fix matches during their visit to India. After the incident, Tendulkar and three other senior cricketers worked to ensure that players &quot;whose performance and conduct was dubious were never picked for the Indian squad again&quot;.

==== Role in 2007 captaincy change ====
During the Indian team&#x27;s 2007 tour of England, the desire of Rahul Dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. Then Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sharad Pawar offered the captaincy to Tendulkar, who instead recommended Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for suggesting Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.

=== Continued rise ===
==== 2001–02: Mike Denness incident, Kolkata Test, and breaking Bradman&#x27;s record ====
During India&#x27;s 2001 tour of South Africa, in the second Test match, referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing, and fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team. Denness suspended Tendulkar from one match for alleged ball tampering. Television cameras captured images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball. The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism, and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee. The charges against Tendulkar triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.

On the final day of the Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001, Tendulkar took three wickets, including the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. His three wickets haul helped India win the match. In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.

In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test. In the second Test at Port of Spain, Sachin Tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th Test century in his 93rd Test match, to equal Donald Bradman&#x27;s record of 29 Test hundreds. He was gifted a Ferrari 360 Modena by Fiat through Michael Schumacher for achieving this feat.

Then, in an unprecedented sequence, he scored just 0, 0, 8, and 0 in the next four innings. He returned to form in the last Test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. However, India lost the series. In this period, in the third Test match against England in August 2002, Tendulkar scored his 30th Test century to surpass Bradman&#x27;s haul, in his 99th Test match.

==== 2003: Cricket World Cup ====
Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, helping India reach the final. While Australia won, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament award.

He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving New Zealand and Australia. As a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, Matthew Hayden, in the tri-series final.

==== 2003–04: Tour of Australia ====
The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003–04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, scoring 241 not out from 436 balls with 33 fours at a strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spent 613 minutes at the crease during the innings. He followed this up with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test. Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests. It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.00 and just one fifty.

Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests. Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise. Many former cricketers commented that Dravid&#x27;s declaration was in bad taste. After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.

A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004. He played a part in India&#x27;s victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2–1.

=== Performance dip ===

==== 2005–06: Dry spell ====
On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007. Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan. He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006, and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory. On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.

Tendulkar&#x27;s comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century. Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.

==== 2007 Cricket World Cup ====

During the preparation for the 2007 World Cup, Tendulkar&#x27;s attitude was criticised by Indian coach Greg Chappell. Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while Tendulkar felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career. Chappell also believed that Tendulkar&#x27;s repeated failures were hurting the team&#x27;s chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media. Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.

At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against Bangladesh, 57 not out against Bermuda and 0 against Sri Lanka. As a result, former Australian captain Ian Chappell, brother of Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.

After the loss against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, Tendulkar suffered depression and thought to retire from cricket, but Viv Richards and Ajit Tendulkar stopped him. According to Tendulkar, 23 March 2007, the loss against Bangladesh is one of the worst days of his cricketing career.

=== Return to old form and consistency ===
==== 2007 ====
In 2007, in a Test series during India&#x27;s tour of Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the Man of the Series. He continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the Future Cup against South Africa. During the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in ODIs. He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.
On the second day of the Nottingham Test on 28 July 2007, Tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 Test runs. In the subsequent one-day series against England, Tendulkar was the leading run scorer from India with an average of 53.42. In the ODI Series against Australia in October 2007 Tendulkar was the leading Indian run scorer with 278 runs.

Tendulkar was dismissed five times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings. Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career. In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali, and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.

==== 2007–08: Tour of Australia ====

In 2008 India&#x27;s tour of Australia, at a Sydney Test match, Australian Andrew Symonds accused Indian Harbhajan Singh of using racist terminology by calling him a monkey. This matter was dubbed &quot;Monkeygate&quot; by the media. Singh was suspended by the match ICC referee after a hearing. Sachin Tendulkar was standing at the non-striker&#x27;s end at the moment when Symonds claimed the racist comments were made. In the hearing, Tendulkar said to the ICC match referee Mike Procter, that he could not say what exactly Singh said to Symonds, but in the next hearing, Tendulkar changed his stance and said that Symonds had not said &quot;monkey&quot; but &quot;&quot;Teri Maa Ki...&quot; (&#x27;Your mother&#x27;s...&#x27;). In his autobiography &quot;Playing It My Way&quot;, Tendulkar wrote, &quot;Teri Maa Ki...&quot;, It is an expression we often use in North India to vent our anger and to me it all part of the game&quot;. The matter became big in the following days and nearly led to the cancellation of this tour. The referee suspended Singh for 3 Tests but after appeal and Tendulkar&#x27;s statement in the hearing the suspension was overturned. Andrew Symonds later said in &quot;Monkeygate- Ten years on&quot;, a documentary that was based on this matter, &quot;When I began to play for Mumbai Indians, IPL franchise, once Harbhajan Singh came to me and apologised.&quot; Symonds said in the documentary, &quot;We go to a very wealthy man&#x27;s place for a barbecue, drinks, and dinner one night, and the whole team&#x27;s there, and he had guests there, and Harbhajan said &#x27;mate, can I speak to you for a minute out in the garden out the front?&#x27; He goes, &#x27;look, I&#x27;ve got to say sorry to you for what I did to you in Sydney. I apologise.&quot; The &quot;Herald Sun&quot; stated that Tendulkar is still not &quot;forgiven&quot; by some Aussie players for changing his account on Monkeygate, dubbing Tendulkar an Indian &quot;demigod&quot;.

In the Border–Gavaskar Trophy, 2007–08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with &quot;493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings. Tendulkar scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the MCG in Melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for Australia. In the controversial New Years&#x27; Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though India lost the Test. This was his third century at the SCG and his 38th Test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings. In the third Test at the WACA cricket ground in Perth, Tendulkar was instrumental in India&#x27;s first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. India went on to record a historic triumph at the WACA, ending Australia&#x27;s run of 16 consecutive wins. In the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126-run stand with VVS Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4. He secured the Man of the Match award.

In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving India, Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs. He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5 February 2008 at the Gabba in Brisbane. He started the series with scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32. His form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament, but Tendulkar came back strongly in India&#x27;s must-win game against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls. He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final, and 91 runs in the second final. Both the knocks were nominated to be the ODI Batting Performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo.

==== 2008: Return to Tests and breaking Brian Lara&#x27;s record ====
South Africa toured in March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series; he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the 2008 Asia Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.

Before the Indian cricket team&#x27;s tour of Sri Lanka in July 2008, Tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past Brian Lara&#x27;s record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three matches.

In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury. However, during the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first Test before making 88 in the first innings of the second Test, breaking the record for most Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000-run mark when he was on 61. He described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record. He made a fifty in the third Test and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2–0 and regained the Border–Gavaskar Trophy.

==== 2008: England Series ====
Tendulkar was again out of the first three ODIs of a seven-match ODI series at home against England due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI and 50 in the fifth, before the series was called off due to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5–0 to India.

England returned for a two-match Test series in December 2008, and the first Test, which was originally planned to be held in Mumbai, was shifted to Chennai following the terror attacks. Chasing 387 for victory in that match, Tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with Yuvraj Singh. This was his third century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and the first which resulted in a win. He dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks. The knock was nominated to be one of the Test Batting Performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo. Tendulkar scored poorly in the second Test at Mohali, which ended in a draw. India won the series 1–0.

==== 2009–10: Consolidation and ODI record ====
In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai. Tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.

India&#x27;s next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs. In the ODI series, Tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. India made 392, won the match and eventually won the series 3–1. Tendulkar made 160 in the first Test, his 42nd Test century, and India won. He made 49 and 64 in the second Test and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with India needing only two wickets to win. India won the series 1–0.

Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies, but was back for the Compaq Cup Tri Series between India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46 and 27 in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs. This was Tendulkar&#x27;s sixth century in a final of an ODI tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.

Tendulkar played only one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan as India lost. The next match against Australia was abandoned due to rain and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.

Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games. In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2–2, Australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs. Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would steer India to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler Clint McKay over short fine leg only to be caught by Nathan Hauritz, with India needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and Australia won the match by three runs. During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 ODI runs, and achieved his personal best against Australia, as well as the third-highest score in a defeat. The knock was voted as the Best ODI Batting Performance of 2009 by ESPNcricinfo.

In the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in 2009–10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches, with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous. India won the series 3–1. In the Test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first Test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third Tests, respectively, as India clinched innings victories in both the Tests, to win the series 2–0.

Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent Test series. He made 105 not out and 16 in the first Test, and 143 in the second. India won both the Tests.

In the two-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first Test. He then scored 106 in the first innings of the second Test, which was his 47th hundred in Test cricket. It was also his fourth hundred in successive Tests, and he was the fourth Indian to achieve this feat. In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world&#x27;s first batsman to score a double century in ODI cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by Pakistan&#x27;s Saeed Anwar and Zimbabwe&#x27;s Charles Coventry.

=== 2011–12: World Cup win and final years ===
From February to April, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka hosted the 2011 World Cup. Amassing 482 runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, Tendulkar was India&#x27;s leading run-scorer for the tournament; only Tillakaratne Dilshan of Sri Lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament, and was named in the ICC &quot;Team of the Tournament&quot;. India defeated Sri Lanka in the final. Shortly after the victory, Tendulkar commented that &quot;Winning the World Cup is the proudest moment of my life. ... I couldn&#x27;t control my tears of joy.&quot;

India were due to tour the West Indies in June, although Tendulkar chose not to participate. He returned to the squad in July for India&#x27;s tour of England. Throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether Tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (Test and ODIs combined). However, his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side. The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed. Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi. For his performances in 2011, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC.

Ian Chappell was not happy with Tendulkar&#x27;s performance after India&#x27;s tour of Australia. He says that Tendulkar&#x27;s quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia. Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Tendulkar should have retired from ODI&#x27;s after the World Cup. Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Tendulkar has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long. The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Tendulkar in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.

==== 100th international century ====
On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar accomplished a remarkable feat by scoring his 100th international century in a match against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup, held at Mirpur. This was a pioneering achievement, as he became the first cricketer to ever reach this landmark. This century was not just a momentous occasion for Tendulkar, but it was also his first ODl century against Bangladesh. Despite the widespread media attention and public fascination with this milestone, Tendulkar confessed that it was a challenging time for him, as the constant focus on his 100th hundred became a mentally onerous task. Despite Tendulkar&#x27;s illustrious century, India was unable to secure a triumph against Bangladesh, resulting in a defeat by a margin of 5 wickets.

==== Domestic return ====
After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home, in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.

However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012, some people have started to question his place in the Indian team. A report by &quot;The Hindustan Times&quot; said that Tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector Sandeep Patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs. This speculation, however, was later considered to be false.

Then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012–13 Ranji Trophy. He scored 108 in the quarter-final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Tendulkar was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium. Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead. In the semi-final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Tendulkar scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70), and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays. In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer. Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.

He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India&#x27;s 526. This was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling Sunil Gavaskar&#x27;s Indian record for most first-class hundreds.

==== Retirement ====
After a series of underwhelming performances during the 2012 series against England, Tendulkar announced his departure from One Day International cricket on 23 December 2012. However, he stated that he would continue to be available for representation in the Test format of the sport. Upon the announcement of his retirement from One Day International cricket, former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly expressed his surprise, noting that Tendulkar could have still participated in the upcoming series against Pakistan. Anil Kumble reflected on the difficulty of imagining an Indian ODI team without Tendulkar&#x27;s name, while Javagal Srinath acknowledged the transformative impact Tendulkar had on the game, starting from the time he debuted as an opener in New Zealand in 1994.

After playing a Twenty20 International in 2006 against South Africa, he said that he would not play the format again. He announced his retirement from the IPL after his team, Mumbai Indians, beat Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 26 May to win the Indian Premier League 2013. He retired from Twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 in September–October 2013 in India for Mumbai Indians.

On 10 October 2013 Tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-Test series against West Indies in November. At his request, the BCCI arranged that the two matches be played at Kolkata and Mumbai so that the farewell would happen at his home ground. He scored 74 runs in his last Test innings against West Indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in Test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain Virat Kohli. The Cricket Association of Bengal and the Mumbai Cricket Association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport. Various national and international figures from cricket, politics, Bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long &quot;Salaam Sachin Conclave&quot; organised by &quot;India Today&quot;.

=== Post-retirement ===
In July 2014, he captained the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord&#x27;s.
In December 2014, he was announced ambassador of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 event. It is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. He got the ambassador position of the ICC Cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).

==== Exhibition and charity matches ====
Tendulkar organised exhibition cricket matches in partnership with former Aussie cricketer Shane Warne. Cricket All-Stars held in US in baseball stadiums and had retired players, some of them was Sourav Ganguly, Shoaib Akhtar, Wasim Akram.

On 8 February 2020, he played in the Bushfire Cricket Bash, a charity match organised to raise fund for Australian bushfire victims.

He captained the India legends team to victory in the 2020–21 Road Safety World Series and was the leading run scorer for the Indian team in the tournament.

He acted as a coach for the Ponting XI during The Big Appeal. During the innings break, he batted an over against Ellyse Perry and Annabel Sutherland at Perry&#x27;s request.

== Indian Premier League ==
Tendulkar was made the Icon player and captain for his home side, the Mumbai Indians in the inaugural Indian Premier League Twenty20 competition in 2008. As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, Sanath Jayasuriya.

In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh&#x27;s record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony. Tendulkar has scored more than 500 runs in IPL in two different seasons as a captain.

Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of the second edition of the Champions League T20. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.

In the 2011 IPL, against Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored 100 not out off 66 balls. In 2013, Tendulkar retired from Indian Premier League and in 2014 he was appointed as the Mumbai Indian&#x27;s &quot;Team Icon&quot;. His last match for the team was the
final of the 2013 Champions League, where he scored 14 runs in an Indians victory. In his 78 matches in the IPL, Tendulkar scored a total of 2,334 runs; at the time of his retirement he was the fifth-highest run-scorer in the competition&#x27;s history. Mumbai Indians retired his number 10 jersey as a tribute to Tendulkar. He recently stepped down as the mentor of the franchise citing personal reasons.

== Playing style ==

Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand. He would also practice left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. ESPNcricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the &quot;most wholesome batsman of his time&quot;. His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia. He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot. In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that &quot;it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does&quot;.

Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that, &quot;Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar&#x27;s technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman&#x27;s wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar&quot;.

Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork. Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace. He has been affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then, Tendulkar&#x27;s batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career, and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that, &quot;Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke&quot;.

Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips&#x27; heads, especially in his later years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.
While Tendulkar was not a regular bowler, he could bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowled when two batsmen of the opposite team had been batting together for a long period, as he could often be a useful partnership breaker. With his bowling, he helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion. He took 201 international wickets in his career—46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs, where he is India&#x27;s twelfth-highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.

== Reception and legacy ==
Tendulkar is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential cricketers in the history of cricket. His consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including among Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries. One of the most popular sayings by his fans is, &quot;Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God&quot;. ESPNcricinfo mentions in his profile that, &quot;... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world&quot;.

During the Australian tour of India in 1998, Matthew Hayden said, &quot;I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests&quot;. However, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said, &quot;I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn&#x27;t&quot;. Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film &quot;Stumped&quot; in 2003, appearing as himself.

On 24 February 2010, the cricket website ESPNcricinfo could not handle the heavy traffic experienced after Tendulkar broke the record for the highest individual male score in a One Day International match against South Africa, also becoming the first player to score 200* in the history of ODIs as more than 5 million fans visited the website at a time.

There have been many instances when Tendulkar&#x27;s fans undertook extreme activities over his dismissal in a game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, for example, a young man hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar&#x27;s failure to reach his 100th century.

At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar&#x27;s fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to &quot;wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night&quot;. In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.

<doc id="57572" wikidata="Q13276" url="?curid=57572" title="Cake">
<text>Cake is a flour confection usually made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients and is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate and which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.

The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil, or margarine), a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts, or dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream, or syrups), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.

Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.

==History==
The term &quot;cake&quot; has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word &quot;kaka&quot;.

The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (&quot;plakous&quot;), which was derived from the word for &quot;flat&quot;, πλακόεις (&quot;plakoeis&quot;). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. They also had a cake called &quot;satura&quot;, which was a flat, heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became &quot;placenta&quot;, which was derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.

The Greeks invented beer as a leavener, frying fritters in olive oil, and cheesecakes using goat&#x27;s milk. In ancient Rome, the basic bread dough was sometimes enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, which produced a sweet and cake-like baked good. The Latin poet Ovid refers to his and his brother&#x27;s birthday party and cake in his first book of exile, &quot;Tristia&quot;.

Early 14th century cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a &quot;cake&quot; and &quot;bread&quot; were the round, flat shape of the cakes and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.

Sponge cakes, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during the Renaissance, possibly in Spain.

===Cake mixes===
During the Great Depression, there was a surplus of molasses and the need to provide easily made food to millions of economically depressed people in the United States. One company patented a cake-bread mix to deal with this economic situation and thereby established the first line of cake in a box. In doing so, cake, as it is known today, became a mass-produced good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty.

Later, during the post-war boom, other American companies (notably General Mills) developed this idea further, marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience, especially to housewives. When sales dropped heavily in the 1950s, marketers discovered that baking cakes, once a task at which housewives could exercise skill and creativity, had become dispiriting. This was a period in American ideological history when women, retired from the war-time labor force, were confined to the domestic sphere while still exposed to the blossoming consumerism in the US. This inspired psychologist Ernest Dichter to find a solution to the cake mix problem in the frosting. Since making the cake was so simple, housewives and other in-home cake makers could expend their creative energy on cake decorating inspired by, among other things, photographs in magazines of elaborately decorated cakes.

Ever since boxed cake mix has become a staple of supermarkets, it is often complemented with frosting in a can.

==Varieties==
Cakes are broadly divided into several categories, based primarily on ingredients and mixing techniques. There are about &quot;hundreds&quot; of different types of cakes, but there are two broad categories, that culinary divide them into: &quot;shortened,&quot; and &quot;unshorted cakes.&quot; Unshortened cakes contain no fat while &quot;shortened cakes&quot; do. These types may be combined in baking.

Although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise classification has always been elusive.

===Butter cake===
Butter cakes are made from creamed butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They rely on the combination of butter and sugar beaten for an extended time to incorporate air into the batter. A classic pound cake is made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Another type of butter cake that takes its name from the proportion of ingredients used is 1-2-3-4 cake: 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 3 cups flour, and 4 eggs. According to Beth Tartan, this cake was one of the most common among the American pioneers who settled North Carolina.

Baking powder is in many butter cakes, such as Victoria sponge. The ingredients are sometimes mixed without creaming the butter, using recipes for simple and quick cakes.

===Sponge cake===
Sponge cakes (or foam cakes) are made from whipped eggs, sugar, and flour. Traditional sponge cakes are leavened only with eggs. They rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally beaten eggs) to provide leavening, sometimes with a bit of baking powder or other chemical leaven added. Egg-leavened sponge cakes are thought to be the oldest cakes made without yeast.

Angel food cake is a white cake that uses only the whites of the eggs and is traditionally baked in a tube pan. The French Génoise is a sponge cake that includes clarified butter. Highly decorated sponge cakes with lavish toppings are sometimes called &quot;gateau&quot;, the French word for cake. Chiffon cakes are sponge cakes with vegetable oil, which adds moistness.

===Chocolate cake===
Chocolate cakes are butter cakes, sponge cakes, or other cakes flavored with melted chocolate or cocoa powder. German chocolate cake is a variety of chocolate cake.

===Coffee cake===

Coffee cake is generally thought of as a cake to serve with coffee or tea at breakfast or a coffee break. Some types use yeast as a leavening agent, while others use baking soda or baking powder. These cakes often have a crumb topping called streusel or a light glaze drizzle.

===Flourless cake===
Baked flourless cakes include clementine cakes, baked cheesecakes, and flourless chocolate cakes.

===Layer cakes===

Layer cakes are cakes made with layers of sponge or butter cake filled with cream, jam, or other filling to hold the layers together.

===One-egg cake===
One-egg cakes are made with one egg. They can be made with butter or vegetable shortening. One egg cake was an economical recipe when using two eggs for each cake was too costly.

==Comparison with bread ==
Although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise classification has always been elusive. For example, banana bread may be properly considered either a quick bread or a cake. Yeast cakes are the oldest and are very similar to yeast bread. Such cakes are often very traditional in form and include such pastries as babka and stollen.

==Special-purpose cakes==
Cakes may be classified according to the occasion for which they are intended. For example, wedding cakes, birthday cakes, cakes for first communion, Christmas cakes, Halloween cakes, and Passover plava (a type of sponge cake sometimes made with matzo meal) are all identified primarily according to the celebration they are intended to accompany. The cutting of a wedding cake constitutes a social ceremony in some cultures. The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of originated in the sharing of a cake.

Particular types of cake may be associated with particular festivals, such as stollen or chocolate log (at Christmas), babka and simnel cake (at Easter), or mooncake. There has been a long tradition of decorating an iced cake at Christmas time; other cakes associated with Christmas include chocolate log and mince pies.

A Lancashire Courting Cake is a fruit-filled cake baked by a fiancée for her betrothed. The cake has been described as &quot;somewhere between a firm sponge – with a greater proportion of flour to fat and eggs than a Victoria sponge cake – and a shortbread base and was proof of the bride-to-be&#x27;s baking skills&quot;. Traditionally it is a two-layer cake filled and topped with strawberries or raspberries and whipped cream.

==Shapes==

Cakes are frequently described according to their physical form. Cakes may be small and intended for individual consumption. Larger cakes may be made to be sliced and served as part of a meal or social function. Common shapes include:
* Bundt cakes
* Cake dress
* Cake balls
* Cake pops
* Conical, such as the Kransekake
* Cupcakes and madeleines, which are both sized for a single person
* Layer cakes, frequently baked in a springform pan and decorated
* Sheet cakes, simple, flat, rectangular cakes baked in sheet pans
* Swiss rolls

==Cake flour==

Special cake flour with a high starch-to-gluten ratio is made from fine-textured, soft, low-protein wheat. It is strongly bleached and compared to all-purpose flour, cake flour tends to result in cakes with a lighter, less dense texture. Therefore, it is frequently specified or preferred in cakes meant to be soft, light or bright white, such as angel food cake. However, if cake flour is called for, a substitute can be made by replacing a small percentage of all-purpose flour with cornstarch or removing two tablespoons from each cup of all-purpose flour. Some recipes explicitly specify or permit all-purpose flour, notably where a firmer or denser cake texture is desired.

==Cooking==

A cake can fail to bake properly, which is called &quot;falling&quot;. In a cake that &quot;falls&quot;, parts may sink or flatten, because it was baked at a temperature that is too low or too hot, when it has been underbaked and when placed in an oven that is too hot at the beginning of the baking process. The use of excessive amounts of sugar, flour, fat or leavening can also cause a cake to fall. A cake can also fall when subjected to cool air that enters an oven when the oven door is opened during the cooking process.

==Cake decorating==
A finished cake is often enhanced by covering it with icing, or frosting, and toppings such as sprinkles, which are also known as &quot;jimmies&quot; in certain parts of the United States and &quot;hundreds and thousands&quot; in the United Kingdom. The frosting is usually made from powdered (icing) sugar, sometimes a fat of some sort, milk or cream, and often flavorings such as a vanilla extract or cocoa powder. Some decorators use a rolled fondant icing. Commercial bakeries tend to use lard for the fat, and often whip the lard to introduce air bubbles. This makes the icing light and spreadable. Home bakers either use lard, butter, margarine, or some combination thereof. Sprinkles are small firm pieces of sugar and oils that are colored with food coloring. In the late 20th century, new cake decorating products became available to the public. These include several specialized sprinkles and even methods to print pictures and transfer the image onto a cake.

Special tools are needed for more complex cake decorating, such as piping bags and various piping tips, syringes and embossing mats. To use a piping bag or syringe, a piping tip is attached to the bag or syringe using a coupler. The bag or syringe is partially filled with icing which is sometimes colored. Using different piping tips and various techniques, a cake decorator can make many different designs. Basic decorating tips include open star, closed star, basketweave, round, drop flower, leaf, multi, petal, and specialty tips. An embossing mat is used to create embossed effects. A cake turntable that cakes are spun upon may be used in cake decoration.

Royal icing, marzipan (or a less sweet version, known as almond paste), fondant icing
(also known as sugar paste), and buttercream are used as covering icings and to create decorations. Floral sugarcraft or wired sugar flowers are an important part of cake decoration. Cakes for special occasions, such as wedding cakes, are traditionally rich fruit cakes or occasionally Madeira cakes, that are covered with marzipan and iced using royal icing or sugar-paste. They are finished with piped borders (made with royal icing) and adorned with a piped message, wired sugar flowers, hand-formed fondant flowers, marzipan fruit, piped flowers, or crystallized fruits or flowers such as grapes or violets.

==Food safety==

The shelf life of cakes packages for commercial sale depends on several factors. Cakes are intermediate moisture products prone to mold growth. Commercial cakes are frequently and commonly exposed to different mold varieties before they are packaged for sale, including &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; and various penicillins, and &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot;. Preservatives and oxygen absorbents are currently used to control and inhibit mold growth.

The CDC has recommended not to eat raw cake batter because it can contain pathogens like &quot;Salmonella&quot; and &quot;E. coli&quot;. Cake batter uses raw flour which can contain live bacteria and present a hazard if consumed.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name is unknown. According to the most frequently considered theory, it was derived from the personal name Olmút, meaning &quot;Olmút&#x27;s&quot; (castle, court). Another theory says that the name was derived from the Proto-Slavic words (&#x27;beer&#x27;) and (&#x27;to make noise&#x27;).

According to legend, there was a Roman fort founded by Roman legionnaires under the command of Julius Caesar. The fort was called or , and the name Olomouc was derived from it. Although archaeologists have found traces of a camp of Roman legionnaires, the legend of the presence of Julius Caesar originated in the Renaissance period and nothing confirms it.

==Geography==
Olomouc is located about northeast of Brno and southeast of Prague. It lies mostly in a flat fertile land of the Upper Morava Valley. The eastern spur of the municipal territory (the villages of Lošov, Radíkov and Svatý Kopeček) extends into the Nízký Jeseník range and includes the highest point of Olomouc, a hill at above sea level. The Litovelské Pomoraví Protected Landscape Area extends into the territory of Olomouc in the north.

The Morava River and the stream of Mlýnský potok, which is a branch of the Morava, flow through the city. The Bystřice flows into the Morava at the city centre. The Oskava briefly forms the northern municipal border, before it joins the Morava.

Chomoutovské Lake, located in the northern tip of the municipal territory, was created by flooding a gravel quarry and has an area of . Together with the immediate surroundings, it is protected as a nature monument. The lake is an important stop for migratory birds and is home to one of the largest colonies of black-headed gulls and Mediterranean gulls in the country.

===Climate===
Olomouc&#x27;s climate is classified as humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dcbo&quot;). Among them, the annual average temperature is , the hottest month in July is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which July is the wettest with , while February is the driest with only . The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on 11 February 1929 to on 3 and 8 August 2013.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
As early as the 7th century, a gord of the early Slavs developed in the present-day quarter of Povel. It was probably an administrative centre of a larger unit. Povel is considered one of the three most important Moravian localities of the early Middle Ages. In the early 9th century, the gord was conquered and completely disappeared.

A new centre, where the Great Moravian governor resided, developed at the gord at Předhradí, a quarter of the inner city (the eastern, smaller part of the medieval centre). This settlement survived the defeat of the Great Moravia (c. 907) and gradually became the capital of the province of Moravia.

Around 981–990, the Polish Duke Mieszko I took the Moravian Gate and Olomouc as an important place at the intersection of trade routes. Olomouc probably was mentioned in the Dagome iudex document () as &quot;Alemura&quot;. All of Moravia was part of Poland between 1003 and 1031 during the reign of Bolesław I the Brave and partly Mieszko II Lambert. The first certain mention of the city dates back to 1017. Moravia was under Bohemian rule since 1031 (according to some Czech historians, since 1019 or 1021).

The bishopric of Olomouc was founded in 1063. It was possibly re-founded because there are some unclear references to bishops of Moravia in the 10th century—if they were not only missionary bishops, but representatives of some remains of regular church organization, then it is very likely that these bishops had their seat in Olomouc. Centuries later in 1777, it was raised to the rank of an archbishopric. The bishopric was moved from the church of St. Peter (since destroyed) to the church of Saint Wenceslaus in 1141 (the date is still disputed, other suggestions are 1131, 1134) under bishop Jindřich Zdík. The bishop&#x27;s palace was built in the Romanesque architectural style. The bishopric acquired large tracts of land, especially in northern Moravia, and was one of the richest in the area.

Olomouc became one of the most important settlements in Moravia and a seat of the Přemyslid government and one of the &quot;appanage&quot; princes. In 1306 King Wenceslas III stopped here on his way to Poland. He was going to fight Władysław I the Elbow-high to claim his rights to the Polish crown and was assassinated. With his death, the whole Přemyslid dynasty died out.

The city was officially founded in the mid-13th century and became one of the most important trade and power centres in the region. In the Middle Ages, it was the biggest town in Moravia and competed with Brno for the position of capital. Olomouc finally lost after the Swedes took the city and held it for eight years (1642–1650).

In 1235, the Mongols launched an invasion of Europe. After the Battle of Legnica in Poland, the Mongols carried their raids into Moravia, but were defensively defeated at the fortified town of Olomouc. The Mongols subsequently invaded and defeated Hungary.

In 1454 the city expelled its Jewish population as part of a wave of anti-Semitism, also seen in Spain and Portugal. The second half of the 15th century is considered the start of Olomouc&#x27;s golden age. It hosted several royal meetings, and Matthias Corvinus was elected here as King of Bohemia (in fact anti-king) by the estates in 1469. In 1479 two kings of Bohemia (Vladislaus II and Matthias Corvinus) met here and concluded an agreement (Peace of Olomouc of 1479) for splitting the country.

===Modern===
Participating in the Protestant Reformation, Moravia became mostly Protestant. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, in 1640 Olomouc was occupied by the Swedes for eight years. They left the city in ruins, and as a result it lost its predominant place in Moravia, becoming second to Brno.

In 1740 the town was captured and briefly held by the Prussians. Olomouc was fortified by Maria Theresa during the wars with Frederick the Great, who besieged the city unsuccessfully for seven weeks in 1758. In 1848 Olomouc was the scene of the emperor Ferdinand&#x27;s abdication. Two years later, Austrian and German statesmen held a conference here called the Punctation of Olmütz. At the conference, they agreed to restore the German Confederation and Prussia accepted leadership by the Austrians.

In 1746 the first learned society in the lands under control of the Austrian Habsburgs, the &quot;Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis&quot;, was founded in Olomouc to spread Enlightenment ideas. Its monthly &quot;Monatliche Auszüge&quot; was the first scientific journal published in the Habsburg empire.

Largely because of its ecclesiastical links to Austria, Salzburg in particular, the city was influenced by German culture since the Middle Ages. Demographics before censuses can only be interpreted from other documents. The town&#x27;s ecclesiastical constitution, the meetings of the Diet and the locally printed hymnal, were recorded in Czech in the mid-16th and 17th centuries. The first treatise on music in Czech was published in Olomouc in the mid-16th century. The political and social changes that followed the Thirty Years&#x27; War increased the influence of courtly Habsburg and Austrian/German-language culture. The &quot;Germanification&quot; of the town likely resulted from the cosmopolitan nature of the city; as the cultural, administrative and religious centre of the region, it drew officials, musicians and traders from all over Europe.

Despite these influences, Czech dominated, particularly in ecclesiastical publications throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. When the Austrian-born composer and musician Philip J. Rittler accepted a post at the Wenceslas Cathedral in the latter 17th century, he felt it necessary to learn Czech. With the continued dominance of the Habsburgs and migration of ethnic Germans into the area, the use of Czech declined. By the 19th century, the number of ethnic Germans in the city were recorded as three times higher than the number of Czechs.

After the 1848 revolution, the government rescinded its Jewish expulsion order of 1454. Jews returned to the city and, in 1897, built a synagogue. The Jewish population reached 1,676 in 1900.
Olomouc retained its defensive city walls almost until the end of the 19th century. This suited the city council, because demolishing the walls would have allowed for expansion of the city and attracted more Czechs from neighbouring villages. The city council preferred Olomouc to be smaller and predominantly German. Greater expansion came after World War I and the establishment of Czechoslovakia. In 1919 Olomouc annexed two neighbouring towns and 11 surrounding villages, gaining new space for additional growth and development.

Serious tensions arose between ethnic Czechs and Germans during both world wars. During World War II, the city was under German occupation and most of the city&#x27;s ethnic German residents sided with the Nazis; the German-run city council renamed the main square (until then named after president T. G. Masaryk) after Adolf Hitler. World War II brought a rise in anti-semitism and attacks on the Jews that reflected what was happening in Germany. On Kristallnacht (10 November 1938), townspeople destroyed the synagogue. In March 1939, city police arrested 800 Jewish men, and had some deported to the Dachau concentration camp. During 1942–1943, ethnic Germans sent the remaining Jews to Theresienstadt and other German concentration camps in occupied Poland. Fewer than 300 of the city&#x27;s Jews survived the Holocaust. The Germans also established and operated a Gestapo prison in the city, and a forced labour camp in the Chválkovice district.

After Olomouc was liberated, Czech residents took back the original name of the city square. When the retreating German army passed through the city in the final weeks of the war, they shot at its 15th-century astronomical clock, leaving only a few pieces intact (these are held in the local museum). The city was restored to Czechoslovakia, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime with stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. In the 1950s, the clock was reconstructed under the influence of Soviet government; it features a procession of proletarians rather than saints. After the war, the government participated in the expulsion of ethnic Germans from the country, following the Allied leaders&#x27; Potsdam Agreement, which redefined the Central European borders, although many of these people&#x27;s families had lived for two centuries in the region. There were the statue of the first president T. G. Masaryk reconstructed as a symbol of come back of democracy on Masaryk street after &quot;velvet revolution&quot; in 1990. Its inner city is the third-largest urban monument reservation in the country, after Prague. 

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The Olomouc agglomeration was defined as a tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds. It is an area that includes the city and its surroundings, linked to the city by commuting and migration. It has about 401,000 inhabitants and also includes the cities of Přerov and Prostějov. 

==Transport==

Public transport in Olomouc is provided by trams and buses.

The first train arrived in Olomouc on 17 October 1841 from Vienna. In 1845, the first omnibuses connected the railway station and the centre of Olomouc. In 1899, omnibuses were replaced with trams.

The main railway station in Olomouc (Olomouc hlavní nádraží) is an important railway junction. The city is connected with Prague, Ostrava, Brno, Zlín and Břeclav. Passenger trains of all categories operated by České dráhy, RegioJet and LEO Express make stops there.

The D35 motorway goes along the southern and western municipal border. The D46 motorway splits from it and connects Olomouc with Prostějov.

==Culture==
The city is the home of the Moravian Theatre Olomouc (&quot;Moravské divadlo&quot;) and the Moravian Philharmonic (&quot;Moravská filharmonie Olomouc&quot;). In 2023 it was decided, they will be merged in one institution. Olomouc is also the centre of the ethnographic region of Haná. As a student city with 2nd oldest university in town, Olomouc offers many cultural events and festivals: Academia Film Olomouc, Festival of Animated Film (PAF), Divadelní Flora and many others. There are several theatre venues (including Divadlo na cucky, Divadlo Tramtarie or Divadlo K3). Cinema is represented by a single screen Kino Metropol (opened in 1933) and three multiplexes.

==Education==
Palacký University, the oldest in Moravia and second oldest in the Czech Republic, was founded in 1573 as part of an effort to reestablish Roman Catholicism in the country. At the time, roughly nine out of ten inhabitants of the Czech Crown lands were Protestants. Most of its faculties were suppressed in the 1850s by the Habsburg régime in retaliation for professor and student support for the 1848 revolution and the Czech National Revival. The university was fully restored in 1946; it was renamed Palacký University of Olomouc.

The university plays a very important role in the life of the city: with over 25,200 students (including those at Moravian College Olomouc), Olomouc has the highest density of university students in Central Europe. Many of the city&#x27;s services are student-oriented. They close during holidays and the university exam periods. During the summer holiday, the trams run solo (apart from rush-hours), while during the university sessions, the lines are served by two coupled trams.

The university buildings comprise about a third of the city&#x27;s heritage centre; notable ones include the University Art Centre and the so-called Armoury (now Central Library).

==Sport==

Olomouc is home to the professional football club SK Sigma Olomouc playing in the Czech First League. Its reserve team, SK Sigma Olomouc B, plays in the Czech National Football League. Sigma Olomouc plays its home matches at Andrův stadion with a capacity of 12,474 seats, which regularly hosts international matches as well. The second football club in the city is 1. HFK Olomouc.

The city&#x27;s ice hockey club is HC Olomouc, playing in the Czech Extraliga (top tier). It plays its home matches at Zimní stadion Olomouc. RC Olomouc is a rugby club, playing in the third-tier competition.

On the north west side and adjacent of the Andrův stadion was a facility called the Spartakiad Stadium, which was built after World War II. The stadium was used for various purposes and promoted the Spartakiad, most notably during the 1950s and 1960s. The site also held motorcycle speedway and hosted a final round of the Czechoslovak Individual Speedway Championship in 1964, 1968 and 1969.

==Sights==

Olomouc contains several large squares, the chief of which is adorned with the Holy Trinity Column, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The column is high and was built between 1716 and 1754.

The city has numerous historic religious buildings. The most prominent church is Saint Wenceslas Cathedral founded before 1107 in the compound of the Olomouc Castle. At the end of the 19th century, the cathedral was rebuilt in the neo-Gothic style. It kept many features of the original church, which had renovations and additions reflecting styles of different ages: Romanesque crypt, Gothic cloister, Baroque chapels. The highest of the three spires is , the second-highest in the country (after Cathedral of St. Bartholomew in Plzeň). The church is next to the Bishop Zdík&#x27;s Palace (also called the Přemyslid Palace), a Romanesque building built after 1141 by the bishop Jindřich Zdík. It remains one of the most precious monuments of Olomouc: Such an early bishop&#x27;s palace is unique in Central Europe. The Přemyslid Palace, used as the residence of Olomouc dukes from the governing Přemyslid dynasty, stood nearby.

Church of Saint Maurice, a fine Gothic building of the 15th century, has the 6th-largest church organ in Central Europe.

Church of Saint Michael is notable. The Neo-baroque Chapel of Saint John Sarkander stands on the site of a former town prison. At the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Catholic priest John Sarkander was imprisoned here. Accused of collaboration with the enemy, he was tortured but did not reveal anything because of the Seal of Confession and died. The torture rack and Sarkander&#x27;s gravestone are preserved here. He was canonized by Pope John Paul II during his visit in Olomouc in 1995.

John Paul II also visited &quot;Svatý Kopeček&quot; (&quot;The Holy Hillock&quot;), which has the magnificent Baroque Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary. It overlooks the city. The Pope promoted the church to Minor Basilica. Several monasteries are in Olomouc, including Hradisko Monastery, Convent of Dominican Sisters in Olomouc and others.

Other notable destinations are the Olomouc Orthodox Church, consecrated to Saint Gorazd, and the Mausoleum of Yugoslav Soldiers. This monument commemorates 1,188 Yugoslav soldiers who died during World War I in local hospitals after being wounded on battlefields.

The principal secular building is the city hall, completed in the 15th century. It is flanked on one side by a gothic chapel, now adapted and operated as the Olomouc Museum of Art. It has a tower high, adorned with an astronomical clock in an uncommon Socialist Realist style. The original 15th-century clock was destroyed at the end of World War II. It was reconstructed in 1947–1955 by Karel Svolinský, who used the government-approved style of the time, featuring proletarians rather than saints. This is also the reason why the clock&#x27;s calendar represents some of the most important days of the Communist regime.

Olomouc has unique set of six Baroque fountains. They survived in such number thanks to the city council&#x27;s caution. While most European cities were removing old fountains after building water-supply piping, Olomouc decided to keep them as reservoirs in case of fire. The fountains feature ancient Roman motifs; five portray the Roman gods Jupiter (image), Mercury (image), Triton (image), Neptune and Hercules (image). One features Julius Caesar, the legendary founder of the city (image). In the 21st century, an Arion fountain was added to the main square, inspired by the older project.

In front of the astronomical clock on the Horní (&quot;Upper&quot;) Square, which is the largest square in Olomouc, is a scale model of the entire old town in bronze.

<text>Brno ( , ; ) is a city in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. Located at the confluence of the Svitava and Svratka rivers, Brno has about 400,000 inhabitants, making it the second-largest city in the Czech Republic after the capital, Prague, and one of the 100 largest cities of the European Union. The Brno metropolitan area has approximately 730,000 inhabitants.

Brno is the former capital city of Moravia and the political and cultural hub of the South Moravian Region. It is the centre of the Czech judiciary, with the seats of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court, and the Supreme Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, and a number of state authorities, including the Ombudsman, and the Office for the Protection of Competition. Brno is also an important centre of higher education, with 33 faculties belonging to 13 institutes of higher education and about 62,000 students.

Brno Exhibition Centre is among the largest exhibition centres in Europe. The complex opened in 1928 and established the tradition of large exhibitions and trade fairs held in Brno. Brno hosts motorbike and other races on the Masaryk Circuit, a tradition established in 1930, of which the Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix is one of the most prestigious races. Another cultural tradition is an international fireworks competition, &quot;Ignis Brunensis&quot;, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors to each display.

The most visited sights of the city include the Špilberk Castle and fortress and the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul on Petrov hill, two medieval buildings that dominate the cityscape and are often depicted as its traditional symbols. The other large preserved castle near the city is Veveří Castle by Brno Reservoir. Another architectural monument of Brno is the functionalist Villa Tugendhat, which was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 2001. One of the natural sights nearby is the Moravian Karst. The city is a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network and was designated a &quot;City of Music&quot; in 2017.

==Names==
The etymology of the name &quot;Brno&quot; is disputed. It might be derived from the Old Czech &#x27; &#x27;muddy, swampy.&#x27; Alternative derivations are a Slavic verb &quot;brniti&quot; (to armour or to fortify) or a Celtic language spoken in the area before it was inhabited by Germanic peoples and later Slavic peoples. The latter theory would make it cognate with other Celtic words for hill, such as the Welsh word &#x27;.

Throughout its history, Brno&#x27;s locals also referred to the town in other languages, including &#x27; in German, ברין (&#x27;) in Yiddish, and &quot;&quot; in Latin. The city was also referred to as Brunn () in English, but that usage is not common today.

The asteroid 2889 Brno was named after the city, as was the Bren light machine gun (from &quot;Brno&quot; and &quot;Enfield&quot;), which was widely used in World War II.

==History==
The Brno basin has been inhabited since prehistoric times, as seen in a 2024 discovery of at least 3 three mammoths bones and prehistoric tools dating back 15,000 years. The town&#x27;s direct predecessor was a fortified settlement of the Great Moravian Empire known as &quot;Staré Zámky&quot;, which was inhabited from the Neolithic Age until the early 11th century.

In the early 11th century Brno was established as a castle of a non-ruling prince from the House of Přemyslid, and Brno became one of the centres of Moravia along with Olomouc and Znojmo. Brno was first mentioned in Cosmas&#x27; &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot; dated to the year 1091, when Bohemian king Vratislaus II besieged his brother Conrad at Brno castle.
In the mid 11th century, Moravia was divided into three separate territories; each had its own ruler, coming from the Přemyslids dynasty, but independent of the other two, and subordinate only to the Bohemian ruler in Prague. The seats of these rulers and thus the &quot;capitals&quot; of these territories were the castles and towns of Brno, Olomouc, and Znojmo. In the late 12th century, Moravia began to reunify, forming the Margraviate of Moravia. From then until the mid of the 17th century, it was not clear which town should be the capital of Moravia. Political power was divided between Brno and Olomouc, but Znojmo also played an important role. The Moravian Diet, the Moravian Land Tables, and the Moravian Land Court were all seated in both cities at once. However, Brno was the official seat of the Moravian Margraves (rulers of Moravia), and later its geographical position closer to Vienna also became important. Otherwise, until 1642 Olomouc had a larger population than Brno, and was the seat of the only Roman Catholic diocese in Moravia.

In 1243 the small settlements grouped together to form one fortified settlement, and Brno was granted city royal privileges by the King, and thus recognized as a royal city. As throughout Eastern Central Europe, the granting of city privileges was connected with immigration from German-speaking lands. In 1324 Queen Elisabeth Richeza of Poland founded the Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which now houses her grave. In the 14th century, Brno became one of the centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Moravian Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century, Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia; one of them, Jobst of Moravia, was elected the King of the Romans. Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the Hussites during the Hussite Wars. Both attempts to conquer the city failed.

===17th century===

In 1641, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Holy Roman Emperor and Margrave of Moravia Ferdinand III ordered the permanent relocation of the diet, court, and the land tables from Olomouc to Brno, as Olomouc&#x27;s Collegium Nordicum made it one of the primary targets of Swedish armies. In 1642 Olomouc surrendered to the Swedish Army, which occupied it for eight years. Meanwhile, Brno, as the only Moravian city which, under the leadership of Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, succeeded in defending itself from the Swedes under General Lennart Torstenson during the siege of Brno in 1645, served as the sole capital of the Margraviate of Moravia. After the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648, Brno retained its status as the sole capital. This was later confirmed by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in 1782, and again in 1849 by the Moravian constitution. Today, the Moravian Land Tables are stored in the Moravian Regional Archive, and are included among the national cultural sights of the Czech Republic.

During the 17th century Špilberk Castle was rebuilt as a huge baroque citadel. Brno was besieged by the Prussian Army in 1742 under the leadership of Frederick the Great, but the siege was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1777 the bishopric of Brno was established by the Catholic Church; Mathias Franz Graf von Chorinsky Freiherr von Ledske was the first Bishop.

===19th century===
In December 1805 the Battle of Austerlitz was fought near the city; the battle is also known as the &quot;Battle of the Three Emperors&quot;. Brno itself was not involved with the battle, but the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte spent several nights here at that time, and again in 1809.

In 1839 the first train arrived in Brno from Vienna via the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway. This was the beginning of rail transport in the current Czech Republic and Austria. In the years 1859–1864 the city fortifications were almost completely removed. In 1869 a horsecar service started to operate in Brno, the first tram service in what would later become the Czech Republic.

Gregor Mendel conducted his groundbreaking experiments in genetics while he was a monk at St. Thomas&#x27;s Abbey in Brno in the 1850s.

===20th century and Greater Brno===

Around 1900 Brno, which consisted in administrative terms only of the central city area until 1918, had a predominantly German-speaking population (63%), as opposed to the suburbs, which were predominantly Czech-speaking. Life in the city was therefore bilingual, and what was called in German &quot;Brünnerisch&quot; was a mixed idiom containing elements from both languages.

In 1919, after World War I, two neighbouring towns, Královo Pole and Husovice, and 21 other municipalities were annexed to Brno, creating Greater Brno (). This was done to dilute the German-speaking majority of close to 55,000 by the addition of the Czech communities of the city&#x27;s neighborhood. Included in the German-speaking group were almost all of the 12,000 Jewish inhabitants, including several of the city&#x27;s better known personalities, who made a substantial contribution to the city&#x27;s cultural life. Greater Brno was almost seven times larger, with a population of about 222,000 – before that Brno had about 130,000 inhabitants.

In 1921–1928, Brno was the capital of the administrative region of Land of Moravia (Czech: &quot;Země Moravská&quot;). In 1928–1948, Brno was the capital of the Land of Moravia-Silesia (Czech: &quot;Země Moravskoslezská&quot;).

In 1930, 200,000 inhabitants declared themselves to be of Czech, and some 52,000 of German nationality, in both cases including the respective Jewish citizens.
During the German occupation of the Czech lands between 1939 and 1945, all Czech universities were closed by the Nazis, including those in Brno. The Faculty of Law became the headquarters of the Gestapo, and the university hall of residence was used as a prison. About 35,000 Czechs and some American and British prisoners of war were imprisoned and tortured there; about 800 civilians were executed or died. Executions were public. The Nazis also operated a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp, which held mostly Polish prisoners, an internment camp for Romani people in the city, and a forced labour &quot;education&quot; camp in the present-day district of Dvorska.

Between 1941 and 1942, transports from Brno deported 10,081 Jews to Theresienstadt (Terezín) concentration camp. At least another 960 people, mostly of mixed race, followed in 1943 and 1944. After Terezín, many of them were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, Minsk Ghetto, Rejowiec and other ghettos and concentration camps. Although Terezín was not an extermination camp, 995 people transported from Brno died there. Only 1,033 people returned after the war.

Industrial facilities such as the Československá zbrojovka arms factory and the Zweigwerk aircraft engine factory (which became Zbrojovka&#x27;s subsidiary Zetor after the war) and the city centre were targeted by several Allied bombardment campaigns between 1944 and 1945. The air strikes and later artillery fire killed some 1,200 people and destroyed 1,278 buildings. After the city&#x27;s occupation by the Red Army on 26 April 1945 and the end of the war, ethnic German residents were expelled. In the Brno death march, beginning on 31 May 1945, about 27,000 German inhabitants of Brno were marched to the Austrian border. According to testimony collected by German sources, about 5,200 of them died during the march. Later estimates by Czech sources put the death toll at about 1,700, with most deaths due to an epidemic of shigellosis.

After the reestablishment of an independent Czechoslovak state after World War II, President Edvard Beneš delivered a speech in Brno demanding the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, 20,000 ethnic Germans from the city were expelled into Allied-occupied Austria. After the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic abolished Moravian autonomy and Brno thus ceased to be the capital of Moravia. Since then Moravia has been divided into administrative regions, with Brno the administrative centre of the South Moravian Region.

In 1960s and 1970s, large panel housing estates were built in border districts, such as Bohunice, Líšeň, Bystrc and Vinohrady. During the communist era, most of the workforce was employed in industry, mainly machinery.

After 1989, part of the workforce switched from industry to services, and Brno became the IT centre of the Czech Republic. Nevertheless, new industrial zones were built at the edge of the city, such as Černovická terasa in the east of the city.

==Geography==

Brno is located in the southeastern part of the Czech Republic, at the confluence of the Svitava and Svratka rivers, and there are also several brooks flowing through it, including the Veverka, Ponávka, and Říčka. The Svratka River flows through the city for about , and the Svitava River cuts a path through the city. Brno is situated at the crossroads of ancient trade routes which have joined northern and southern European civilizations for centuries, and is a part of the Danube basin region. The city is historically connected with Vienna, which lies to the south.

Brno is across, measured from east to west, and its total area is . Within the city limits are the Brno Reservoir, several ponds, and other standing bodies of water, such as the reservoirs in the Marian Valley and the Žebětín Pond. Brno is surrounded by wooded hills on three sides; about of the area of the city is forest, 28% of the total. Due to its location between the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands and the Southern Moravian lowlands (Dyje-Svratka Vale), Brno has a moderate climate. Compared to other cities in the country, Brno has a very high air quality, which is ensured by a good natural circulation of air; no severe storms or similar natural disasters have ever been recorded in the city.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Brno has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) for −3 °C original isoterm, but near of the (−2.5 °C average temperature in January, month most cold) or include by updated classification in humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) with cold winters and warm to hot summers. However, in the last 20 years the temperature has increased, and summer days with temperature above are quite common. The average temperature is , the average annual precipitation is about , the average number of precipitation days is 150, the average annual sunshine is 1,771 hours, and the prevailing wind direction is northwest. The weather box below shows average data between years 1961 and 1990. 
Its height above sea level varies from to . The highest peak in the municipal area is the Kopeček Hill (), and the highest point overall lies in Útěchov on the border with the municipality of Vranov.

===Cityscape===
==Administration==


Legally, Brno is a statutory city, consisting of 29 administrative divisions known as city districts. The highest body of self-government is the Brno City Assembly. The city is headed by the lord mayor, who has the right to use the mayor&#x27;s insignia and represents the city externally. As of 2021, the lord mayor is Markéta Vaňková of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). The executive body is the city council and local councils of the city districts; the city council has 11 members including the lord mayor and her four deputies. The assembly of the city elects the lord mayor and other members of the city council, establishes the local police, and is also entitled to grant citizenship of honour and the Awards of the City of Brno. The head of the Assembly of the City of Brno in personal matters is the Chief Executive, who according to certain special regulations carries out the function of employer of the other members of the city management. The Chief Executive is directly responsible to the Lord Mayor.

The city itself forms a separate district, the Brno-City District, surrounded by the Brno-Country District. Brno is divided into 29 administrative divisions (city districts) and consists of 48 cadastral areas. The &quot;Brno-City District&quot; and &quot;Brno-Country District&quot; are not to be confused with the &quot;city districts&quot; of Brno.

The city districts of Brno vary widely in their size by both population and area. The most populated city district of Brno is Brno-Centre, which has over 91,000 residents, and the least populated are Brno-Ořešín and Brno-Útěchov, with about 500 residents. By area, the largest district is Brno-Bystrc () and the smallest is Brno-Nový Lískovec ().

Brno is the home to the highest courts in the Czech judiciary. The Supreme Court is on Burešova Street, the Supreme Administrative Court is on Moravské náměstí (), the Constitutional Court is on Joštova Street, and the Supreme Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of the Czech Republic is on Jezuitská street.

==Demographics==

According to the 2021 census, Brno had 398,510 inhabitants. The largest ethnic groups reported (without options to choose between) were Czechs (51.6%), Moravians (18.7%), Slovaks (1.5%), Ukrainians (0.9%), Vietnamese (0.4%), and Poles (0.2%). 23.7% of inhabitants did not write any nationality. In the 2001 census, when the most common nationalities were list to choose between, 76.1% were Czechs and 18.7% Moravians (94.8% Czechs in the broader sense).

Brno experienced its largest increases in population during the 19th century at the time of the Industrial Revolution, and in 1919 due to a merger with surrounding municipalities.

==Economy==
Since 1990, many companies created or spun off as part of privatization from former national enterprises have disappeared. Before 1990, engineering companies were very important in Brno; since then, the city&#x27;s economy has largely reoriented itself towards light industry, logistics, and services. The city later gained importance in other fields of engineering, especially in software development. After 2000, foreign technology companies began establishing their branches in Brno, and many Czech companies with local or global reach were also founded here.

Companies operating in Brno include Gen Digital (one of the headquarters, brand AVG Technologies still used), Kyndryl (Client Innovation Centre), AT&amp;T, Honeywell (Global Design Center), Siemens, Red Hat (Czech headquarters), an office of Zebra Technologies, and formerly Silicon Graphics International (Czech headquarters).

In recent years, the quaternary sector of the economy, i.e., activities in science, research, and education, has also begun to develop in Brno. Examples include AdMaS (Advanced Materials, Structures, and Technologies) or CETOCOEN (Center for Research on Toxic Substances in the Environment). The city cultivates this sector via supporting organisations such as the South Moravian Innovation Centre and the VUT Technology Incubator.

==Transport==

Public transport in Brno consists of 12 tram lines, 14 trolleybus lines (the largest trolleybus network in the Czech Republic) and almost 40 day and 11 night bus lines. Trams (known locally as &quot;šaliny&quot;) first appeared on the streets in 1869; this was the first operation of horse-drawn trams in the modern-day Czech Republic. The local public transport system is interconnected with regional public transport in one integrated system (IDS JMK), and directly connects several nearby municipalities with the city. Its main operator is the Brno City Transport Company (DPmB), which also operates a mostly recreational ferry route at the Brno Dam Lake. A tourist minibus provides a brief tour of the city. In 2011, the city announced plans to build a metro system light rail system to alleviate overcrowding of trams and to reduce congestion on the surface.

Railway transport began operating in the city in 1839 on the Brno–Vienna line, the first operating railway line in the modern-day Czech Republic. Today, Brno is a transnational railway hub, with nine stations for passenger traffic. The current main railway station is the central hub of regional train services, used by about 50,000 passengers every day, with around 500 trains passing through. The station is operating at full capacity; the main station building is outdated and lacks sufficient operating capacity, but the construction of the new station has been postponed several times for various reasons. A referendum over whether to move the station was held on 7 and 8 October 2016, coinciding with regional elections.

Brno is also an international road transport crossroads. There are two motorways on the southern edge of the city: the D1 leading to Ostrava and Prague, and the D2 leading to Bratislava. Not far from the city limits is the D52 motorway leading to Vienna. Another planned motorway, the D43, will connect Brno to northwestern Moravia. The city is gradually building the large city ring road (road I/42). Several road tunnels have been built at Pisarky, Husovice, Hlinky, and Královo pole, and more are planned. Due to the congestion in private transport, the city is continuing to try to build more parking ramps, including underground, but these efforts have not always been successful.

Air transport is enabled by two functional airports. The public international airport, Brno-Tuřany Airport, saw a sharp increase in passenger traffic up to 2011, however the number of passengers declined in the following years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The airport also serves as one of the two bases for police helicopters in the Czech Republic. The other airport, Medlánky Airport, is a small domestic airport serving mainly recreational activities such as flying hot air balloons, gliders or aircraft RC models.

Cycling is widespread in Brno due to lowland nature of the landscape. Existing tracks for cycling and roller skating in 2011 totalled approximately , and are gradually being expanded. There is also one long bikeway leading to Vienna, approximately long. Several hiking trails of the Czech Tourist Club also pass through Brno.

==Culture==
The city spends about 30 million euro every year on culture. A vibrant university city with about 60,000 students, Brno is home to many museums, theatres and other cultural institutions, and also hosts a number of festivals and other cultural events.

Since the 1990s Brno has experienced a great cultural &quot;rebirth&quot;: façades of historical monuments are being repaired and various exhibitions, shows, etc., are being established or extended. In 2007 a summit of 15 presidents of EU Member States was held in Brno.

Despite its urban character, some of the city districts still preserve traditional Moravian folklore, including folk festivals with traditional Moravian costumes, Moravian wines, folk music and dances. Unlike smaller municipalities, in Brno annual traditional Moravian folk festivals are held in several city districts, including Židenice, Líšeň, and Ivanovice.

Hantec is a unique slang that originated in Brno.

===Festivals===
The biggest festival in Brno is the fireworks competition festival, Ignis Brunensis (Latin for &quot;Flame of Brno&quot;), held annually in June, part of the &quot;Brno – City in the Centre of Europe&quot; festival. Ignis Brunensis is the biggest show of its kind in Central Europe, usually attracting 100,000–200,000 visitors to each display.

The international film festival &quot;Cinema Mundi&quot; screens about 60 films competing for Oscar nomination in the category of Best Foreign Language Film.

&quot;Theatre World Brno&quot; is another international festival held annually in the city, in which Brno theatres and the city centre stage around 100 performances by national and foreign ensembles.

Other festivals held regularly in Brno include the International Music Festival Brno, the Spilberk International Music Festival, and the Summer Shakespeare Festival.

Every September, Brno hosts a wine festival, &quot;Slavnosti vína&quot;, to celebrate the harvest in the surrounding wine-producing region.

===Theatres===

Brno has a long theatre tradition. Brno has the oldest theatre building in Central Europe, the Reduta Theatre on Zelný trh. The first theatre plays in Brno probably took place in the 1660s in the &quot;City Tavern&quot;, today&#x27;s Reduta Theatre; however, the first theatre with boxes was built in this complex in 1733. The first documented professional Czech performance took place in 1767, again in the Reduta Theatre; the play was called &quot;Zamilovaný ponocný&quot; () and was performed by the Venice Theatre Company. The same year, Mozart performed in the theatre with his elder sister Anna Maria (Nannerl). In that year the Mozart family spent Christmas in Brno, and their visit is commemorated by a statue of Mozart as a child in front of the Reduta Theatre. The theatre&#x27;s &quot;Mozart Hall&quot; was also named after him.

The National Theatre of Brno is the leading producer of opera, drama, and ballet in the city of Brno. The first permanent seat of NdB was established in 1884, and today this institution owns the Mahen Theatre, built in 1882, Janáček Theatre, built in 1965, and the Reduta Theatre. The composer Leoš Janáček is also connected with the National Theatre of Brno. The Mahen Theatre was the first theatre building in Europe to be illuminated by Thomas Edison&#x27;s electric light bulbs; at that time it was a completely new invention and there were no power plants built in the city, so a small steam power plant was built nearby just to power the theatre, and Edison came to Brno in 1911 to see it.

The most commercially successful theatre in Brno is the Brno City Theatre, founded in 1945; its performances are usually sold out. They also stage about 150 performances abroad every year. The theatre&#x27;s repertoire consists primarily of musical and dramatic shows.

There are a variety of smaller theatres in Brno, including the Bolek Polivka Theatre, the Goose on a String Theatre (&quot;Divadlo Husa na provázku&quot;), HaDivadlo, Radost Puppet Theatre (&quot;loutkové divadlo Radost&quot;), and Polárka Theatre.

The Mahen Theatre was originally called the City Theatre, and until 1918 it performed exclusively in German and was not part of the National Theatre of Brno. Between 1971 and 1978, some plays were performed at the Brno Exhibition Centre due to reconstruction of the Mahen Theatre.

===Local legends===

There are several legends connected with the City of Brno. One of the best known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon. According to this legend, a terrible creature was terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people had never seen this animal before, so they called it a dragon. They lived in fear of the dragon until one citizen managed to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the &quot;dragon&quot; was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile and dragon motifs are common in Brno. A crocodile () is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl. One of the local baseball teams is named Draci Brno () and the local rugby club is named RC Dragon Brno. There is also a local American football team called the Brno Alligators. An Intercity train connecting Brno and Prague is called &quot;Brněnský drak&quot; ().

Next to the dragon at the Old Town Hall is the town&#x27;s second well-known emblem, a wagon wheel made from a tree found and cut down 50 miles from the city. According to the legend, a local man made a wager that he could fell the tree, make a wheel out of it, and roll the wheel to the City of Brno, all within a single day. Since the achievement was deemed to be impossible by normal human means, the man was believed to have called on the devil for assistance, and died in poverty as a result.

Another local legend relates to the siege of the city by Swedish forces in 1645. The locals and the Swedish army were in a stalemate, and the Swedish general declared that he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon. The bell ringer at Petrov Cathedral tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early, and keeping his word, the general and his army left. As a historic tribute to the event, the bell at Petrov Cathedral still rings for noon an hour earlier, at 11 o&#x27;clock. At this hour every day, the Brno astronomical clock also releases a glass ball as a souvenir.

===Museums, libraries and galleries===

The most significant museum in Brno is the Moravian Museum, the largest museum in Moravia and the second largest in the Czech Republic. The museum was founded in 1817 and its collections include over 6 million pieces. The biggest public library in Brno is the Moravian Library, the second largest library in the Czech Republic with around 4 million volumes. The biggest gallery in Brno is the Moravian Gallery, again the second largest institution of its kind in the Czech Republic and the biggest in Moravia. One section of the Moravian Museum, the Anthropos Pavilion, is related to the oldest history of mankind and prehistoric Europe.

Brno also has a Technical Museum, the largest in Moravia and one of the largest in Czech Republic. The permanent exhibitions chart the advance of science and technology, accompanied by various lifelike models and restored machines. The museum also hosts short-term exhibitions of many different points of interest.

In 2016 the Vašulka Kitchen Brno (VKB) was established in Brno for research, artistic experiment and informal education in the field of new media art. Housed in the Brno House of Arts, it consists of the archive of Steina and Woody Vasulka’ work and presents a permanent exhibition of their selected works.

==Education==

In 2019, 62,000 students were enrolled in Brno&#x27;s higher education institutions. The city is also home to a number of research and development institutions, including the Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC), and the International Clinical Research Center (ICRC).
With over 40,000 students, Masaryk University is the largest university in Brno and the second biggest in the Czech Republic. It consists of nine faculties, with more than 190 departments, institutes, and clinics.

The Brno University of Technology was established in 1899, and is now among the biggest technical universities in the Czech Republic with over 20,000 students. Viktor Kaplan, inventor of the Kaplan turbine, spent nearly 30 years at the German Technical University in Brno, which ceased to exist in 1945, its property transferred to Brno University of Technology.

Mendel University, named after the founder of genetics Gregor Mendel, who developed his revolutionary scientific theories in Brno, has roughly 10,000 students.

Janáček Academy of Music and Performing Arts, named after Leoš Janáček, was founded in 1947 and is one of two academies of music and drama in the Czech Republic. It holds the annual Leoš Janáček Competition.

==Sport==

The city has a long association with motor racing; among other events, the Masaryk Circuit has hosted the Moto GP championship since 1965. The annual Czech Republic motorcycle Grand Prix, the most famous motor race in the Czech Republic, has been held in the city since 1950. Since 1968, Brno has been a permanent fixture on the European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) series.

Track and road cycling have a long history in Brno. The first track races took place here in 1889, and the velodrome in Brno ranks among the oldest velodromes in the world. In 1969 Brno hosted the UCI Track Cycling World Championships and UCI Road World Championships for amateurs, in 1981 the UCI Track Cycling World Championships and in 2001 the UEC European Track Championships for the U23 category. There are two traditional cycling teams: TJ Favorit Brno and Dukla Brno.

The 2010 FIBA World Championship for Women was played in Brno&#x27;s Arena Vodova, with the Czech squad taking the silver medal.

There is a horse-race course at Brno-Dvorská and an aeroclub airport in Medlánky. Several sports clubs represent the city in the various Czech leagues, including FC Zbrojovka Brno (football), HC Kometa Brno (ice hockey), KP Brno (handball), BC Brno (basketball, men) and BK Brno (women), four baseball teams (Draci Brno, Hroši Brno, VSK Technika Brno, MZLU Express Brno), Brno Ravens Lacrosse Club (lacrosse), Brno Alligators (American football), two rugby teams (RC Dragon Brno, RC Bystrc) and others. Tennis players Barbora Krejčíková, Lucie Šafářová, Lukáš Rosol, and Jana Novotná are from Brno, as well as Michal Březina, one of the top Czech figure skaters.

Motorcycle speedway events were held at the Winter Stadium, off Na Rybníčku in Králové Pole. The venue hosted a final round of the Czechoslovak Individual Speedway Championship in 1949, 1950 and 1954.

==Sights==

Brno has hundreds of historical sights, including one designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and eight monuments listed among the national cultural heritage of the Czech Republic. Most of the main sights of Brno are situated in the historical centre. The city has the third largest historic preservation zone in the Czech Republic, the largest one being in the Czech capital Prague. However, there is a considerable difference in the number of historical preservation zones of both cities. While Brno has 484 legally protected sites, Prague has as many as 1,330.

Špilberk Castle, originally a royal castle founded in the 13th century, was from the 17th century a fortress and feared prison (e.g. Carbonari). Today it is one of the city&#x27;s principal monuments.

Another key landmark is the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, built during the 14th and 15th centuries in place of an 11th-century chapel. Its present form with two neo-Gothic towers was completed in 1909. The other large castle near the city is Veveří Castle.

The Abbey of Saint Thomas was the site of Gregor Mendel&#x27;s experiments establishing the new science of genetics. The Church of Saint Tomas houses the tomb of its founder, John Henry and his son Jobst of Moravia, Margraves of Moravia. The Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady houses the grave of its founder Queen Elisabeth Richeza. The Church of Saint James is one of the best preserved and most spectacular Gothic churches in Brno.
Brno Ossuary is the second largest ossuary in Europe, after the Catacombs of Paris. Another ossuary is the Capuchin crypt, with mummies of Capuchin monks and some of the notable people of their era, including architect Mořic Grimm and the mercenary leader Baron Trenk. The Labyrinth under Zelný trh, a system of underground corridors and cellars dating back to the Middle Ages, has been recently opened to the public. These cellars have been used mainly for storing food, maturing beer and wine, and as wartime shelters. Originally, they were not interconnected as they are now – this happened later during the reconstruction in 2009.

Brno is home to a functionalist Synagogue and the largest Jewish cemetery in Moravia. A Jewish population lived in Brno as early as the 13th century, and remnants of tombstones can be traced back to as early as 1349. The functionalist synagogue was built between 1934 and 1936. While the Brno Jewish community numbered 12,000 in 1938, only 1,000 survived Nazi persecution during Germany&#x27;s occupation in World War II. Today, the cemetery and synagogue are again maintained by a Brno Jewish community. The only Czech mosque, founded in 1998, is also located in Brno.

The era between the world wars saw a building boom to the city, leaving it with many modern and especially functionalist buildings, the most celebrated being Villa Tugendhat, designed by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in the 1920s for the wealthy family of Fritz Tugendhat, and finished in 1930. It was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2001. Another renowned architect who significantly shaped Brno was Arnošt Wiesner. Other functionalist buildings include the Avion Hotel and Morava Palace. The Brno Exhibition Centre is the city&#x27;s main attraction for international business visitors, visited by over one million visitors each year, and hosting over 40 professional trade fairs and business conferences.

Lužánky is the oldest public park in the Czech Republic, established in the late 18th century by the emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Denis Gardens were founded in the early 19th century and were the first public park in the present-day Czech Republic founded by public authorities. Špilberk Park is classified as a national cultural sight of the Czech Republic, as a unique piece of landscape architecture.

One of Brno&#x27;s more recent additions is the Brno astronomical clock.

The AZ Tower, opened in 2013 and tall, is the tallest building in the Czech Republic.

<text>Limassol, also known as Lemesos, is a city on the southern coast of Cyprus and capital of the Limassol district. Limassol is the second-largest urban area in Cyprus after Nicosia, with an urban population of 195,139 and a district population of 262,238. The Limassol municipality is the most populated in Cyprus, with a population of 108,105, followed by Strovolos in Nicosia.

Limassol was built between two ancient Greek cities, Amathus and Kourion. Its historical centre is located around the medieval Limassol Castle and the Old Port. Today the city spreads along the Mediterranean coast and has extended much farther than the castle and port, with its suburbs stretching along the coast to Amathus. To the west of the city is Akrotiri, one of the two British Overseas Territories of Akrotiri and Dhekelia on the island.

In 2014, Limassol was ranked by TripAdvisor as the 3rd up-and-coming destination in the world, in its Top 10 Traveler&#x27;s Choice Destinations on the Rise list.

== Etymology ==
The name “Limassol” originates from the ancient Greek word “Nemesos” (), which means “one found in the middle&quot;. This likely refers to the city’s location between the ancient towns of Amathus and Kourion. Over time, the name evolved into “Lemesos&quot;, which is known in English as “Limassol&quot;.

== History ==

=== Ancient ===

Limassol is situated between the ancient city-kingdoms of Amathus, founded around 1100 BC by Greek settlers, and Kourion, founded around the same time. Settlements in the modern area of Limassol were most likely founded after the decline and destruction of Amathus, around the 7th century AD. The area around Limassol shows evidence of human activity dating back to the Neolithic period (around 7000 BC). Sites like Chirokitia, although not directly in Limassol, indicate the presence of early farming communities. During the Bronze Age, the region saw the development of more complex societies, with evidence of trade and cultural exchanges with neighbouring regions. These early settlements and city-kingdoms laid the foundation for Limassol’s development, contributing to its rich historical and cultural heritage. Ancient writers and geographers mention nothing about the foundation of the town.

According to the Council of Chalcedon which took place in 451, the local bishop as well as the bishops of Amathus and Arsinoe were involved in the foundation of the city, which would be known by the names of Theodosiana and Neapolis. Bishop Leontios of Neapolis was an important church writer in the 7th century. The records of the 7th Synod (757) refer to it as the bishop&#x27;s see. The town was known as Lemesos by the 10th century.

===Medieval===

The history of Limassol is largely known by the events associated with the Third Crusade. The king of England, Richard the Lionheart, was travelling to the Holy Land in 1190. His fiancée, Berengaria, and his sister, Joan, were also travelling there, but on a different ship. Due to a storm, the women&#x27;s ship arrived in Limassol. Isaac Komnenos, the renegade Byzantine governor of Cyprus, invited the noblewomen ashore, with the intention of holding them for ransom, but they refused. So he refused them fresh water and they had to put out to sea again or yield to capture. When Richard arrived in Limassol and met Isaac Komnenos, he asked him to contribute to the crusade for the liberation of the Holy Land. At the beginning Isaac agreed but later on refused. Richard took him captive; the entire island was therefore taken over by the Anglo-Normans, bringing the long Byzantine dominion of Cyprus to an end. Richard celebrated his marriage with Berengaria who had received the crown as queen of England in Cyprus. Richard destroyed Amathus and the inhabitants were transferred to Limassol.

A year later, in 1191 Cyprus was sold for the sum of 100,000 bezants to the Templars, rich monks and soldiers whose aim was the protection of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

The knights enforced high taxes, in order to get back the money that had been given for the purchase of Cyprus. This led to the revolt of the Cypriots, who wished to get rid of the bond of the promise. Richard accepted their request and a new purchaser was found: Guy of Lusignan, a Roman Catholic from Poitou. Cyprus was therefore handed over to the French dynasty of the house of Lusignan, thus establishing the medieval Kingdom of Cyprus.

For a period of about three centuries (1192–1489), Limassol enjoyed remarkable prosperity. Cyprus was characterised by its great number of Latin bishops. This lasted until the occupation of Cyprus by the Ottomans in 1570. Latin battalions which established monasteries were settled down there. The settlement of merchants in Cyprus and particularly in Limassol in the 13th century led to the financial welfare of its inhabitants. Its harbour as a centre of transportation and commerce, contributed greatly to the financial and cultural development.

===Venetian rule===
Cyprus was sold in 1489 to Venice by the Cypriot Queen Catherine Cornaro. The Venetians were not interested in Cyprus. They only wanted to receive taxes and exploit the island’s sources. All the inhabitants were enslaved by the Venetians, and were obliged to give a third of their income, whether this was part of their products of the land. Travelers who visited Cyprus in the 16th century commented on the poor condition of the local population in the towns of the island.

In 1538 the Ottomans captured the city and the Limassol castle. The Venetian governor of Cyprus, after recapturing the castle, decided to demolish it in order to avoid its possible seizure. This destruction was completed in 1567-68. Two years later the Ottomans captured the city.

=== Ottoman rule ===
The Ottoman Empire invaded Cyprus in 1570–1577 and occupied it. Limassol was conquered in July 1570 without any resistance. After the Ottoman acquisition of Cyprus in 1576, the remains or parts of the remains of the Limassol castle were incorporated in the new Ottoman fort, completed in 1590, which was considerably strengthened. The underground chamber and the first floor were transformed into prison cells and remained in use until 1950.

Some neighbourhoods, primarily to the east of the city, were predominantly Greek, while those to the west were mainly Turkish, with a mixed area around the castle. Christians lived in small, low houses that required one to bend to enter, a deliberate design to prevent Turks from riding horses into the homes. During the period of Turkish rule, Cyprus experienced a general decline. The Turks did not contribute to any development, and Greeks and Turks lived in separate neighbourhoods. The intellectual standards of Cypriots declined due to the lack of interest from the conquerors, oppression, and high taxation, which hindered the intellectual development of children.

The church played an important role in the education of Greeks during the years 1754–1821. During those years, many new schools were established all over the island, most notable in Limassol being the Greek School (modern-day Laniteio Lyceum). Greek history, Turkish and French were taught at schools.

===British colony===

In 1878, the British had administrative control over Cyprus after the Cyprus convention. The first British governor of Limassol was Colonel Warren. He showed a particular interest in Limassol and even from the first days the condition of the town showed an improvement. The roads were cleaned, the animals were removed from the centre, roads were fixed, trees were planted and docks were constructed for the loading and unloading of those ships that were anchored off-shore. Lanterns for the lighting of the central areas were also installed in the 1880s. In 1912, electricity replaced the old lanterns.

From the first years of the British occupation, a post office, a telegraph office and a hospital began to operate. In 1880, the first printing press started working. It was in this printing press that the newspapers &quot;Alithia&quot; and &quot;Anagennisis&quot; were published in 1897. The newspaper &quot;Salpinx&quot; was published at the same time.

At the end of the 19th century, the first hotels began to operate. Among these were Europe and Amathus. These changes that the British brought about contributed to the development of an intellectual and artistic life. Schools, theatres, clubs, art galleries, music halls, sport societies, football clubs etc. were all set up and meant a great deal to the cultural life of Limassol.

=== Modern day ===
Due to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 the Turkish Cypriot inhabitants of Limassol were transferred to the north of Cyprus. Accordingly, many Greek Cypriots refugees who were uprooted from their homes in the north, fled, and settled down in the city. When Famagusta was occupied by Turkish troops, Limassol experienced rapid growth fuelled by the large population increase and the need for housing. Many luxury hotels, restaurants and entertainment venues were built, making Limassol the new commerce centre of Cyprus, the role which had been filled by Famagusta.

Today, Limassol is the second largest city in Cyprus and hosts the island’s main port. It is renowned for its extravagant annual events, attracting numerous visitors from both the island and around the globe.

=== Historically ===

Historically, Limassol had a mixed population of Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots, and Armenian Cypriots. Most Turkish Cypriots moved to the north in 1974-1975. Consequently, many Greek Cypriots from the north, who became refugees following the Turkish invasion, settled in the city. In the 1990s, several Cypriot Romani people (considered Turkish Cypriots according to the constitution) returned from the north to the Turkish quarter of Limassol. Armenians remained in Limassol, residing around the Sourp Kevork Armenian Apostolic Church and maintain the Nareg Armenian School ().

<text>Basra () is a port city in southern Iraq. It is the capital of the eponymous Basra Governorate, as well as the third largest city in Iraq overall, behind Baghdad and Mosul. Located near the Iran–Iraq border at the north-easternmost extent of the Arabian Peninsula, the city is situated along the banks of the Shatt al-Arab that empties into the Persian Gulf. It is consistently one of the hottest cities in Iraq, with summer temperatures regularly exceeding 50 °C (122 °F).

Built in 636 as a military camp, Basra played an important role as a regional hub of knowledge, trade and commerce during the Islamic Golden Age and is home to the first mosque built outside the Arabian Peninsula. It was a center of the slave trade in Mesopotamia, until the Zanj rebellion in 871. Historically, Basra is one of the ports from which fictional Sinbad the Sailor embarked on his journeys. It has experienced numerous ruling shifts. In 1258, the city was sacked by the Mongols. Basra came under Portuguese control in 1526 and was later occupied by the Safavids in 1697. It subsequently fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire as part of the Basra Vilayet. During World War I, British forces captured Basra in 1917. It was incorporated into Mandatory Iraq, under the framework Mandate for Mesopotamia after 1921, which later became the independent Kingdom of Iraq in 1932.

Since Iraq&#x27;s independence, the wars Iraq has fought have made Basra an active battlefield due to its strategic location. During the Iran–Iraq War, the city was heavily shelled and besieged by Iranian forces. As a result of the war, half of the city&#x27;s population fled. It suffered extensive damage again during the Gulf War due to coalition attacks. In 1991 and 1999, Basra was the site of two uprisings against Saddam Hussein. On April 6, 2003, the city was occupied by the United Kingdom and United States-led coalition, becoming the first city to be captured during the invasion of Iraq, enduring further devastation. During the war, it fell under the control of Shia factions such as Muqtada al-Sadr&#x27;s Mahdi Army, who were later removed in 2008. Additionally, Basra was targeted by bombings in 2011 and 2012, and was impacted by the Islamist insurgency and the war with Islamic State from 2013 to 2017.

With its strategic location and abundant oil reserves, Basra has become one of the major industrial cities in the region. As the country’s only coastal region, along with its adjoining governorate, Basra serves as a crucial transport hub. Additionally, the city boasts numerous tourist attractions along the river and within the historic old city. After the Iraq war ended, Basra experienced a period of prosperity and development, with numerous reconstruction projects funded by foreign investments. A large number of megaprojects are being developed around Basra, such as the Grand Faw Port, which have gained global attention. Today, the majority of its population consists of Arab Shia Muslims.

==Etymology==
The city has had many names throughout history, Basrah being the most common. In Arabic, the word &quot;baṣrah&quot; means &quot;the overwatcher&quot;, which may have been an allusion to the city&#x27;s origin as an Arab military base against the Sassanids. Others have argued that the name is derived from the Aramaic word &quot;basratha&quot;, meaning &quot;place of huts, settlement&quot;.

==History==

===Foundation by the Rashidun Caliphate (632–661)===

The city was founded at the beginning of the Islamic era in 636 and began as a garrison encampment for Arab tribesmen constituting the armies of the Rashidun Caliph Umar. A tell a few kilometers south of the present city still marks the original site which was a military site. While defeating the forces of the Sassanid Empire there, the Muslim commander Utbah ibn Ghazwan erected his camp on the site of an old Persian military settlement called &quot;Vaheštābād Ardašīr&quot;, which was destroyed by the Arabs. While the name Al-Basrah in Arabic can mean &quot;the overwatch&quot;, other sources claim that the name actually originates from the Persian word Bas-rāh or Bassorāh, meaning &quot;where many ways come together&quot;.

In 639, Umar established this encampment as a city with five districts, and appointed Abu Musa al-Ash&#x27;ari as its first governor. The city was built in a circular plan according to the Partho-Sasanian architecture. Abu Musa led the conquest of Khuzestan from 639 to 642, and was ordered by Umar to aid Uthman ibn Abi al-As, then fighting Iran from a new, more easterly &quot;miṣr&quot; at Tawwaj. In 650, the Rashidun Caliph Uthman reorganised the Persian frontier, installed ʿAbdullah ibn Amir as Basra&#x27;s governor, and put the military&#x27;s southern wing under Basra&#x27;s control. Ibn Amir led his forces to their final victory over Yazdegerd III, the Sassanid King of Kings. In 656, Uthman was murdered and Ali was appointed Caliph. Ali first installed Uthman ibn Hanif as Basra&#x27;s governor, who was followed by ʿAbdullah ibn ʿAbbas. These men held the city for Ali until the latter&#x27;s death in 661. 

Basra&#x27;s infrastructure was planned. Why Basra was chosen as a site for the new city remains unclear. The original site lay 15km from the Shatt al-Arab and thus lacked access to maritime trade and, more importantly, to fresh water. Additionally, neither historical texts nor archaeological finds indicate that there was much of an agricultural hinterland in the area before Basra was founded. 

Indeed, in an anecdote related by al-Baladhuri, al-Ahnaf ibn Qays pleaded to the caliph Umar that, whereas other Muslim settlers were established in well-watered areas with extensive farmland, the people of Basra had only &quot;reedy salt marsh which never dries up and where pasture never grows, bounded on the east by brackish water and on the west by waterless desert. We have no cultivation or stock farming to provide us with our livelihood or food, which comes to us as through the throat of an ostrich.&quot; Nevertheless, Basra overcame these natural disadvantages and rapidly grew into the second-largest city in Iraq, if not the entire Islamic world. Its role as a military encampment meant that the soldiers had to be fed, and since those soldiers were receiving government salaries, they had money to spend. Thus, both the government and private entrepreneurs invested heavily in developing a vast agricultural infrastructure in the Basra region. These investments were made with the expectation of a profitable return, indicating the value of the Basra food market. Although African Zanj slaves from the Indian Ocean slave trade were put to work on these construction projects, most of the labor was done by free men working for wages. Governors sometimes directly supervised these projects, but usually they simply assigned the land while most of the financing was done by private investors. The result of these investments was a massive irrigation system covering some 57,000 hectares between the Shatt al-Arab and the now-dry western channel of the Tigris. This system was first reported in 962, when just 8,000 hectares of it remained in use, for the cultivation of date palms, while the rest had become desert. This system consists of a regular pattern of two-meter-high ridges in straight lines, separated by old canal beds. The ridges are extremely saline, with salt deposits up to 20 centimeters thick, and are completely barren. The former canal beds are less salty and can support a small population of salt-resistant plants. 

Contemporary authors recorded how the Zanj slaves were put to work clearing the fields of salty topsoil and putting them into piles; the result was the ridges that remain today. This represents an enormous amount of work: H.S. Nelson calculated that 45 million tons of earth were moved in total, and with his extremely high estimate of one man moving two tons of soil per day, this would have taken a decade of strenuous work by 25,000 men. Ultimately, Basra&#x27;s irrigation canals were unsustainable, because they were built at too little of a slope for the water flow to carry salt deposits away. This required the clearing of salty topsoil by the Zanj slaves in order to keep the fields from becoming too saline to grow crops. After Basra was sacked in by Zanj rebels in the late 800s and then by the Qarmatians in the early 900s, there was no financial incentive to invest in restoring the irrigation system, and the infrastructure was almost completely abandoned. Finally, in the late 900s, the city of Basra was entirely relocated, with the old site being abandoned and a new one developing on the banks of the Shatt al-Arab, where it has remained ever since.

===Umayyad Caliphate: 661–750===
The Sufyanids held Basra until Yazid I&#x27;s death in 683. The Sufyanids&#x27; first governor was Umayyad ʿAbdullah, a renowned military leader, commanding fealty and financial demands from Karballah, but poor governor. In 664, Mu&#x27;awiya I replaced him with Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan, often called &quot;ibn Abihi&quot; (&quot;son of his own father&quot;), who became infamous for his draconian rules regarding public order. On Ziyad&#x27;s death in 673, his son ʿUbayd Allah ibn Ziyad became governor. In 680, Yazid I ordered ʿUbayd Allah to keep order in Kufa as a reaction to Husayn ibn Ali&#x27;s popularity as the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. &#x27;Ubayd Allah took over the control of Kufa. Husayn sent his cousin as an ambassador to the people of Kufa, but ʿUbaydullah executed Husayn cousin Muslim ibn Aqil amid fears of an uprising. ʿUbayd Allah amassed an army of thousands of soldiers and fought Husayn&#x27;s army of approximately 70 in a place called Karbala near Kufa. ʿUbayd Allah&#x27;s army was victorious; Husayn and his followers were killed and their heads were sent to Yazid as proof.

Ibn al-Harith spent his year in office trying to put down Nafi&#x27; ibn al-Azraq&#x27;s Kharijite uprising in Khuzestan. In 685, Ibn al-Zubayr, requiring a practical ruler, appointed Umar ibn Ubayd Allah ibn Ma&#x27;mar Finally, Ibn al-Zubayr appointed his own brother Mus&#x27;ab. In 686, the revolutionary al-Mukhtar led an insurrection at Kufa, and put an end to ʿUbaydullah ibn Ziyad near Mosul. In 687, Musʿab defeated al-Mukhtar with the help of Kufans who Mukhtar exiled.

Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reconquered Basra in 691, and Basra remained loyal to his governor al-Hajjaj during Ibn Ashʿath&#x27;s mutiny (699–702). However, Basra did support the rebellion of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab against Yazid II during the 720s.

===Abbasid Caliphate and its Golden Age: 750–1258===
In the late 740s, Basra fell to as-Saffah of the Abbasid Caliphate. During the time of the Abbasids, Basra became an intellectual center and home to the elite Basra School of Grammar, the rival and sister school of the Kufa School of Grammar. Several outstanding intellectuals of the age were Basrans; Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham, the Arab literary giant al-Jahiz, and the Sufi mystic Rabia Basri. The Zanj Rebellion by the agricultural slaves of the lowlands affected the area. In 871, the Zanj sacked Basra. In 923, the Qarmatians, an extremist Muslim sect, invaded and devastated Basra.

From 945 to 1055, the Iranian Buyid dynasty ruled Baghdad and most of Iraq. Abu al Qasim al-Baridis, who still controlled Basra and Wasit, were defeated and their lands taken by the Buyids in 947. Adud al-Dawla and his sons Diya&#x27; al-Dawla and Samsam al-Dawla were the Buyid rulers of Basra during the 970s, 980s and 990s. Sanad al-Dawla al-Habashi (–977), the brother of the Emir of Iraq Izz al-Dawla, was governor of Basra and built a library of 15,000 books.
The Oghuz Turk Tughril Beg was the leader of the Seljuks, who expelled the Shiite Buyid dynasty. He was the first Seljuk ruler to style himself Sultan and Protector of the Abbasid Caliphate.

The Great Friday Mosque was constructed in Basra. In 1122, Imad ad-Din Zengi received Basra as a fief. In 1126, Zengi suppressed a revolt and in 1129, Dabis looted the Basra state treasury.
A 1200 map &quot;on the eve of the Mongol invasions&quot; shows the Abbasid Caliphate as ruling lower Iraq and, presumably, Basra.

The Assassin Rashid-ad-Din-Sinan was born in Basra on or between 1131 and 1135.

===Mongol rule and thereafter: 1258–1500s===

In 1258, the Mongols under Hulegu Khan sacked Baghdad and ended Abbasid rule. By some accounts, Basra capitulated to the Mongols to avoid a massacre. The Mamluk Bahri dynasty map (1250–1382) shows Basra as being under their area of control, and the Mongol Dominions map (1300–1405) shows Basra as being under Mongol control. In 1290 fighting erupted at the Persian Gulf port of Basra among the Genoese, between the Guelph and the Ghibelline factions.

Ibn Battuta visited Basra in the 14th century, noting it &quot;was renowned throughout the whole world, spacious in area and elegant in its courts, remarkable for its numerous fruit-gardens and its choice fruits, since it is the meeting place of the two seas, the salt and the fresh.&quot; Ibn Battuta also noted that Basra consisted of three-quarters: the Hudayl quarter, the Banu Haram quarter, and the Iranian quarter (&quot;mahallat al-Ajam&quot;). Fred Donner adds: &quot;If the first two reveal that Basra was still predominantly an Arab town, the existence of an Iranian quarter clearly reveals the legacy of long centuries of intimate contact between Basra and the Iranian plateau.&quot;

The Arab Al-Mughamis tribe established control over Basra in the early fifteenth century, however, they quickly fell under influence of the Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu, successively. The Al-Mughamis&#x27; control of Basra had become nominal by 1436; &quot;de facto&quot; control of Basra from 1436 to 1508 was in the hands of the Moshasha. In the latter year, during the reign of King (&quot;Shah&quot;) Ismail I (1501–1524), the first Safavid ruler, Basra and the Moshasha became part of the Safavid Empire. This was the first time Basra had come under Safavid suzerainty. In 1524, following Ismail I&#x27;s death, the local ruling dynasty of Basra, the Al-Mughamis, resumed effective control over the city. Twelve years later, in 1536, during the Ottoman–Safavid War of 1532–1555, the Bedouin ruler of Basra, Rashid ibn Mughamis, acknowledged Suleiman the Magnificent as his suzerain who in turn confirmed him as governor of Basra. The Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire exercised a great deal of independence, and they even often raised their own troops. Though Basra had submitted to the Ottomans, the Ottoman hold over Basra was tenuous at the time. This changed a decade later; in 1546, following a tribal struggle involving the Moshasha and the local ruler of Zakiya (near Basra), the Ottomans sent a force to Basra. This resulted in tighter (but still, nominal) Ottoman control over Basra.
In 1523, the Portuguese under the command of António Tenreiro crossed from Aleppo to Basra. Nuno da Cunha took Basra in 1529. In 1550, the local Kingdom of Basra and tribal rulers trusted the Portuguese against the Ottomans, from then on the Portuguese threatened to invoke an invasion and conquest of Basra several times. From 1595 the Portuguese acted as military protectors of Basra, and in 1624 the Portuguese assisted the Ottoman Pasha of Basra in repelling a Persian invasion. The Portuguese were granted a share of the customs revenue and freedom from tolls. From about 1625 until 1668, Basra and the Delta marshlands were in the hands of local chieftains independent of the Ottoman administration at Baghdad.

===Ottoman and British rule===
Basra was, for a long time, a flourishing commercial and cultural center. It was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1668. It was fought over by Turks and Persians and was the scene of repeated attempts at resistance. From 1697 to 1701, Basra was once again under Safavid control.

The Zand dynasty under Karim Khan Zand briefly occupied Basra after a long siege in 1775–9. The Zands attempted at introducing Usuli form of Shiism on a basically Akhbari Shia Basrans. The shortness of the Zand rule rendered this untenable.

In 1911, the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot; reported &quot;about 4000 Jews and perhaps 6000 Christians&quot; living in Basra Vilayet, but no Turks other than Ottoman officials. In 1884 the Ottomans responded to local pressure from the Shi&#x27;as of the south by detaching the southern districts of the Baghdad vilayet and creating a new vilayet of Basra.

During World War I, British forces captured Basra from the Ottomans, occupying the city on 22 November 1914. British officials and engineers (including Sir George Buchanan) subsequently modernized Basra&#x27;s harbor, which due to the increased commercial activity in the area became one of the most important ports in the Persian Gulf, developing new mercantile links with India and East Asia.

The graves of around 5,000 men from WW1 both are at Basra War Cemetery and a further 40,000 with no known grave are commemorated at Basra Memorial. Both sites are suffering from neglect with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission having withdrawn from the country in 2007.

===Modern era: 1921–2003===

During World War II (1939–1945), Basra was an important port through which flowed much of the equipment and supplies sent to the Soviet Union by other Allies of World War II.
The population of Basra was 101,535 in 1947, and reached 219,167 in 1957. The University of Basrah was founded in 1964. By 1977, the population had risen to a peak population of some 1.5 million. The population declined during the Iran–Iraq War, being under 900,000 in the late 1980s, possibly reaching a low point of just over 400,000 during the worst of the war. The city was repeatedly shelled by Iran and was the site of many fierce battles, such as Operation Ramadan (1982) and the Siege of Basra (1987).

After the war, Saddam erected 99 memorial statues to Iraqi military officers killed during the war along the bank of the Shatt-al-Arab river, all pointing their fingers towards Iran. After the 1991 Gulf War a rebellion against Saddam erupted in Basra. The widespread revolt was against the Iraqi government who violently put down the rebellion, with much death and destruction inflicted on Basra.

As part of the Iraqi no-fly zones conflict, United States Air Force fighter jets carried out two airstrikes against Basra on 25 January 1999. The airstrikes resulted in missiles landing in the al-Jumhuriya neighborhood of Basra, killed 11 Iraqi civilians and wounding 59. General Anthony Zinni, then commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, acknowledged that it was possible that &quot;a missile may have been errant.&quot; While such casualty numbers pale in comparison to later events, the bombing occurred one day after Arab foreign ministers, meeting in Egypt, refused to condemn four days of air strikes against Iraq in December 1998. This was described by Iraqi information minister Human Abdel-Khaliq as giving U.S.-led forces &quot;an Arab green card&quot; to continue their involvement in the conflict.

A second revolt in 1999 led to mass executions by the Iraqi government in and around Basra. Subsequently, the Iraqi government deliberately neglected the city, and much commerce was diverted to Umm Qasr. These alleged abuses are to feature amongst the charges against the former regime to be considered by the Iraq Special Tribunal set up by the Iraq Interim Government following the 2003 invasion. Workers in Basra&#x27;s oil industry have been involved in extensive organization and labour conflict. They held a two-day strike in August 2003, and formed the nucleus of the independent General Union of Oil Employees (GUOE) in June 2004. The union held a one-day strike in July 2005, and publicly opposes plans for privatizing the industry.

===Post-Saddam period: 2003–present===
In March through to May 2003, the outskirts of Basra were the scene of some of the heaviest fighting in the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003. The British forces, led by the 7th Armoured Brigade, captured the city on 6 April 2003. This city was the first stop for the United States and the United Kingdom during the invasion of Iraq.

On 21 April 2004, a series of bomb blasts ripped through the city, killing 74 people. The Multi-National Division (South-East), under British command, was engaged in foreign internal defense missions in Basra Governorate and surrounding areas during this time. Political groups centered in Basra were reported to have close links with political parties already in power in the Iraqi government, despite opposition from Iraqi Sunnis and the Kurds. January 2005 elections saw several radical politicians gain office, supported by religious parties. American journalist Steven Vincent, who had been researching and reporting on corruption and militia activity in the city, was kidnapped and killed on 2 August 2005.

On 19 September 2005, two undercover British Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers were stopped by the Iraqi Police at a roadblock in Basra. The two soldiers were part of an SAS operation investigating allegations of insurgent infiltration into the Iraqi Police. When the police attempted to pull the soldiers out of their car, they opened fire on the officers, killing two. The SAS soldiers attempted to escape before being beaten and arrested by the police, who took them to the Al Jameat Police Station. British forces subsequently identified the location of the two soldiers and carried out a rescue mission, storming the police station and transporting them to a safe location. A civilian crowd gathered around the rescue force during the incident and attacked it; three British soldiers were injured and two members of the crowd were purportedly killed. The British Ministry of Defence initially denied carrying out the operation, which was criticised by Iraqi officials, before subsequently admitting it and claiming the two soldiers would have been executed if they were not rescued.

The British transferred control of Basra province to the Iraqi authorities in 2007, four-and-a-half years after the invasion. A BBC survey of local residents found that 86% thought the presence of British forces since 2003 had had an overall negative effect on the province. Major-General Abdul Jalil Khalaf was appointed Police Chief by the central government with the task of taking on the militias. He was outspoken against the targeting of women by the militias. Talking to the BBC, he said that his determination to tackle the militia had led to almost daily assassination attempts. This was taken as sign that he was serious in opposing the militias.
In March 2008, the Iraqi Army launched a major offensive, code-named Charge of the White Knights (&quot;Saulat al-Fursan&quot;), aimed at forcing the Mahdi Army out of Basra. The assault was planned by General Mohan Furaiji and approved by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. In April 2008, following the failure to disarm militant groups, both Major-General Abdul Jalil Khalaf and General Mohan Furaiji were removed from their positions in Basra.

Basra was scheduled to host the 22nd Arabian Gulf Cup tournament in Basra Sports City, a newly built multi-use sports complex. The tournament was shifted to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, after concerns over preparations and security. Iraq was also due to host the 2013 tournament, but that was moved to Bahrain. At least 10 demonstrators died as they protested against the lack of clean drinking water and electrical power in the city during the height of summer in 2018. Some protesters stormed the Iranian consulate in the city. In 2023, the city hosted the long scheduled 25th Arabian Gulf Cup where the Iraqi team won.

==Geography==

Basra is located in the Arabian Peninsula on the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, downstream of which is the Persian Gulf. The Shatt-Al-Arab and Basra waterways define the eastern and western borders of Basra, respectively. It is located near to the borders of Iran and Kuwait.

The city is penetrated by a complex network of canals and streams, vital for irrigation and other agricultural use. These canals were once used to transport goods and people throughout the city, but during the last two decades, pollution and a continuous drop in water levels have made river navigation impossible in the canals. Basra is roughly from the Persian Gulf. The city is located along the Shatt al-Arab waterway, from the Persian Gulf and from Baghdad, Iraq&#x27;s capital and largest city.

=== Climate ===
Basra has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), like the rest of the surrounding region, though it receives slightly more precipitation than inland locations due to its location near the coast. During the summer months, from June to August, Basra is consistently one of the hottest cities on the planet, with temperatures regularly exceeding in July and August. In winter Basra experiences mild and somewhat moist conditions with average high temperatures around . On some winter nights, minimum temperatures are below . High humidity – sometimes exceeding 90% – is common due to the proximity to the marshy Persian Gulf.

An all-time high temperature was recorded on 22 July 2016, when daytime readings soared to , which is the highest temperature that has ever been recorded in Iraq. This is one of the hottest temperatures ever measured on the planet. The following night, the night time low temperature was , which was one of the highest minimum temperatures on any given day, only outshone by Khasab, Oman and Death Valley, United States. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Basra was on 22 January 1964.

=== Effect of climate change ===
The city of Basra was once well known for its agriculture, but that has since altered due to rising temperatures, increased water salinity, and desertification.

==Demographics==
Basra Metropolitan Region comprises three towns—Basra city proper, Al-ʿAshar, and Al-Maʿqil—and several villages. In Basra the vast majority of the population are ethnic Arabs of the Adnanite or the Qahtanite tribes. The tribes located in Basra include Bani Malik, Al-shwelat, Suwa&#x27;id, Al-bo Mohammed, Al-Badr, Al-Ubadi, Ruba&#x27;ah Sayyid tribes (descendants of Muhammad) and other Marsh Arabs tribes.

There are also Feyli Kurds living in the eastern side of the city, they are mainly merchants. In addition to the Arabs, there is also a community of Afro-Iraqi peoples, known as Zanj. The Zanj are an African Muslim ethnic group living in Iraq and are a mix of African peoples taken from the coast of the area of modern-day Kenya as slaves in the 900s. They now number around 200,000 in Iraq.

===Religion===
Basra is a major Shia city, with the old Akhbari Shiism progressively being overwhelmed by the Usuli Shiism. It is known as the &quot;Cradle of Islamic Culture&quot;. The Sunni Muslim population is small and dropping in their percentage as more Iraqi Shias move into Basra for various job or welfare opportunities. The satellite town of Az Zubayr in the direction of Kuwait was a Sunni majority town, but the burgeoning population of Basra has spilled over into Zubair, turning it into an extension of Basra with a slight Shia majority as well.

Assyrians were recorded in the Ottoman census as early as 1911, and a small number of them live in Basra. However, a significant number of the modern community are refugees fleeing persecution from ISIS in the Nineveh Plains, Mosul, and northern Iraq. But ever since the victory of Iraq against the ISIS in 2017, many Christians have returned to their homeland in the Nineveh plains. In 2018 there are about a few thousand Christians in Basra. The Armenian Church in Basra, dates from 1736 but has been rebuilt three times. The portrait of the Virgin Mary in the church was brought from India in 1882.

One of the largest communities of pre-Islamic Mandaeans live in the city, whose headquarters was in the area formerly called Suk esh-Sheikh. Basra is home to second highest concentration of the Mandaean community, after Baghdad. As of recent estimates 350 Mandaean families are found in the city. Dair al-Yahya is one of the most important Mandaean temples, located in Basra. The temple is dedicated to John the Baptist, the chief prophet in Mandaeism, who also reverred by the Jews, Christians and Muslims.

The city was also home to one of the oldest Jewish communities. During the 1930s, the Jews constituted 9.8% of the total population. However, most of them fled after a series of persecution, which began in 1941 and lasted till 1951. Between 1968 and 2003, fewer than 300 Jews remained in the city. After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, most of them emigrated to abroad. The Tweig Synagogue in Basra, is currently abandoned.

==Cityscape==

The Old Mosque of Basra is the first mosque in Islam outside the Arabian peninsula. Sinbad Island is located in the centre of Shatt Al-Arab, near the Miinaalmakl, and extends above the Bridge Khaled and is a tourist landmark. The Muhhmad Baquir Al-Sadr Bridge, at the union of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, was completed in 2017. Sayab&#x27;s House Ruins is the site of the most famous home of the poet Badr Shakir al-Sayyab. There is also a statue of Sayab, one of the statues in Basra done by the artist and sculptor Nada&#x27; Kadhum, located on al-Basrah Corniche; it was unveiled in 1972.

Basra Sports City is the largest sport city in the Middle East, located on the Shatt al-Basra. Palm tree forests are largely located on the shores of Shatt-al Arab waterway, especially in the nearby village of Abu Al-Khasib. Corniche al-Basra is a street which runs on the shore of the Shatt al-Arab; it goes from the Lion of Babylon Square to the Four Palaces. Basra International Hotel (formally known as Basra Sheraton Hotel) is located on the Corniche street. The first five star hotel in the city, it is notable for its Shanasheel style exterior design. The hotel was heavily looted during the Iraq War, and it has been renovated recently.

Sayyed Ali al-Musawi Mosque, also known as the Mosque of the Children of Amer, is located in the city centre, on Al-Gazear Street, and it was built for Shia Imami&#x27;s leader Sayyed Ali al-Moussawi, whose followers lived in Iraq and neighbouring countries. The Fun City of Basra, which is now called Basra Land, is one of the oldest theme-park entertainment cities in the south of the country, and the largest involving a large number of games giants. It was damaged during the war, and has been rebuilt. Akhora Park is one of the city&#x27;s older parks. It is located on al-Basra Street.

There are four formal presidential palaces in Basra, built by Saddam Hussein. One of them has been converted into a museum. The Latin Church is located on 14 July Street. Indian Market (&quot;Amogaiz&quot;) is one of the main bazaars in the city. It is called the Indian Market, since it had Indian vendors working there at the beginning of the last century. Hanna-Sheikh Bazaar is an old market; it was established by the powerful and famous Hanna-Sheikh family.

==Economy==

Basra is known as &quot;Iraq&#x27;s economic and industrial capital&quot;. The strategic location made the city, had transformed the city an important hub of trade and commerce. Basra&#x27;s economy is largely dependent on the oil and heavy industry. In the early 1970s, Basra was chosen as a nodal point for Iraq&#x27;s development. A number of projects were launched during this period, such as oil refineries and chemical plants. In April 2017, the Iraqi Parliament recognized Basra as Iraq&#x27;s economic capital. 

Iraq has the world&#x27;s 4th largest oil reserves, estimated to be more . Some of Iraq&#x27;s largest oil fields are located in the province, and most of Iraq&#x27;s oil exports leave from Al Basrah Oil Terminal. The Basra Oil Company (formerly South Oil Company) has its headquarters in the city. Basra has emerged as an important commercial and industrial center for the country, as the city is home to a large number of manufacturing industries ranging from petrochemical to water treatment.

Substantial economic activity in Basra is centred around the petrochemical industry, which includes the Southern Fertilizer Company and The State Company for Petrochemical Industries (SCPI). The Southern Fertilizer Company produces ammonia solution, urea and nitrogen gas, while the SCPI focus on such products as ethylene, caustic/chlorine, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low-density polyethylene, and high-density polyethylene.

Basra is in a fertile agricultural region, with major products including rice, maize corn, barley, pearl millet, wheat, dates, and livestock. For a long time, Basra was known for the superior quality of its dates. Basra was known in the 1960s for its sugar market, a fact that figured heavily in the English contract law remoteness of damages case The Heron II [1969] 1 AC 350. Fishing was an important business before the oil boom. 

== Transport ==
Shipping, logistics and transport are also major industries in Basra. Basra is home to all of Iraq&#x27;s six ports; Umm Qasr is the main deep-water port with 22 platforms, some of which are dedicated to specific goods (such as sulphur, seeds, lubricant oil, etc.) The other five ports are smaller in scale and more narrowly specialized. The city also has an international airport, with service into Baghdad with Iraqi Airways—the national airline.

=== Seaport ===
Basra is Iraq&#x27;s main port, although it does not have deep water access, which is handled at the port of Umm Qasr. However, construction of the Grand Faw Port on the southeastern coast of Basra Governorate, which is considered a national project for Iraq, is expected to strengthen Iraq&#x27;s geopolitical position by giving the country the largest port in the Middle East and one of the largest in the world. Furthermore, Iraq is planning to establish a large naval base in the Faw peninsula.

==Sports==

The city is home to the largest sports stadium in Iraq, the Basra International Stadium, which hosts several matches of the Iraq national football team. The city is also home to sports team Al-Minaa, that uses Al-Minaa Olympic Stadium as its home venue. Its basketball division is among the elite Arab teams that compete at the Arab Club Basketball Championship.

<text>Casablanca is a 1942 American romantic drama film directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid. Filmed and set during World War II, it focuses on an American expatriate (Bogart) who must choose between his love for a woman (Bergman) and helping her husband (Henreid), a Czechoslovak resistance leader, escape from the Vichy-controlled city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Germans. The screenplay is based on &quot;Everybody Comes to Rick&#x27;s&quot;, an unproduced stage play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. The supporting cast features Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson.

Warner Bros. story editor Irene Diamond convinced producer Hal B. Wallis to purchase the film rights to the play in January 1942. Brothers Julius and Philip G. Epstein were initially assigned to write the script. However, despite studio resistance, they left to work on Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series early in 1942. Howard Koch was assigned to the screenplay until the Epsteins returned a month later. Principal photography began on May 25, 1942, ending on August 3; the film was shot entirely at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, with the exception of one sequence at Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles.

Although &quot;Casablanca&quot; was an A-list film with established stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production expected it to stand out among the many pictures produced by Hollywood yearly. &quot;Casablanca&quot; was rushed into release to take advantage of the publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid, if unspectacular, success in its initial run.

Exceeding expectations, &quot;Casablanca&quot; went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Curtiz was selected as Best Director and the Epsteins and Koch were honored for Best Adapted Screenplay. Its reputation has gradually grown, to the point that its lead characters, memorable lines, and pervasive theme song have all become iconic, and it consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films in history. In the inaugural class of 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected the film as one of the first for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;If there is ever a time when they decide that some movies should be spelled with an upper-case M, &quot;Casablanca&quot; should be voted first on the list of Movies.&quot;

== Plot ==

In December 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine owns a nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. &quot;Rick&#x27;s Café Américain&quot; attracts a varied clientele, including Vichy French and Nazi German officials, refugees desperate to reach the still-neutral United States, and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, he ran guns to Ethiopia in 1935 and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.

Petty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of letters of transit obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around German-occupied Europe and to neutral Portugal. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club and persuades Rick to hold them for him. Before he can meet his contact, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under Captain Louis Renault, the unabashedly corrupt prefect of police. Ugarte dies without revealing that Rick has the letters.

Then, the reason for Rick&#x27;s cynical nature—former lover Ilsa Lund—enters his establishment. Spotting Rick&#x27;s friend and house pianist, Sam, Ilsa asks him to play &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;. Rick storms over, furious that Sam disobeyed his order never to perform that song again, and is stunned to see Ilsa. She is accompanied by her husband, Victor Laszlo, a renowned fugitive Czechoslovak Resistance leader. A flashback reveals Ilsa left Rick without explanation when the couple were planning to flee as the German army neared Paris, embittering Rick. Laszlo and Ilsa need the letters to escape, while German Major Strasser arrives in Casablanca to prevent that.

When Laszlo makes inquiries, Signor Ferrari, an underworld figure and Rick&#x27;s friendly business rival, divulges his suspicion that Rick has the letters. Laszlo returns to Rick&#x27;s café that night and tries to buy them. Rick refuses to sell, telling Laszlo to ask his wife why. They are interrupted when Strasser leads a group of German officers in singing &quot;Die Wacht am Rhein&quot;. Laszlo orders the house band to play &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, and Rick allows it. Patriotism grips the crowd and everyone joins in, drowning out the Germans. Afterwards, Strasser has Renault close the club on a flimsy pretext.
Later, Ilsa confronts Rick in the deserted café; when he refuses to give her the letters, she threatens him with a gun but then confesses that she still loves him. She explains that when they met and fell in love in Paris in 1940, she believed her husband had been killed while attempting to escape from a concentration camp. When she learned that Laszlo was alive and hiding near Paris, she left Rick without explanation to nurse her sick husband. Rick&#x27;s bitterness dissolves. He agrees to help, letting Ilsa believe she and Rick will stay together while Laszlo leaves Casablanca. When Laszlo unexpectedly shows up, having narrowly escaped a police raid on a Resistance meeting, Rick has waiter Carl spirit Ilsa away. Laszlo, aware of Rick&#x27;s love for Ilsa, tries to persuade him to use the letters to take her to safety.

When the police arrest Laszlo on a trumped-up charge, Rick persuades Renault to release him by promising to set Laszlo up for a much more serious crime: possession of the letters. To allay Renault&#x27;s suspicions, Rick explains that he and Ilsa will use the letters to leave for America. When Renault tries to arrest Laszlo as arranged, however, Rick forces him at gunpoint to assist in their escape. At the last moment, Rick makes Ilsa board the plane to Lisbon with Laszlo, telling her that she would regret it if she stayed, &quot;Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.&quot; Strasser, tipped off by Renault, drives up alone. When Strasser attempts to stop the plane and then draws a gun on Rick, the latter shoots him dead. Policemen arrive. Renault orders them to &quot;round up the usual suspects.&quot; He suggests to Rick that they join the Free French in Brazzaville. As they walk away into the fog, Rick says, &quot;Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.&quot;

== Cast ==
The play&#x27;s cast consisted of 16 speaking parts and several extras; the film script enlarged it to 22 speaking parts and hundreds of extras. The cast is notably international: only three of the credited actors were born in the United States (Bogart, Dooley Wilson, and Joy Page). The top-billed actors are:
* Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine
* Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. Bergman&#x27;s official website calls Ilsa her &quot;most famous and enduring role&quot;. The Swedish actress&#x27;s Hollywood debut in &quot;Intermezzo&quot; had been well received, but her subsequent films were not major successes until &quot;Casablanca&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert called her &quot;luminous&quot;, and commented on her chemistry with Bogart: &quot;she paints his face with her eyes&quot;. Other actresses considered for the role of Ilsa included Ann Sheridan, Hedy Lamarr, Luise Rainer, and Michèle Morgan. Producer Hal Wallis obtained the services of Bergman, who was contracted to David O. Selznick, by lending Olivia de Havilland in exchange.
* Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo. Henreid, an Austrian actor who had emigrated in 1935, was reluctant to take the role (it &quot;set [him] as a stiff forever&quot;, according to Pauline Kael), until he was promised top billing along with Bogart and Bergman. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors; he considered Bogart &quot;a mediocre actor&quot;; Bergman called Henreid a &quot;prima donna&quot;.

The second-billed actors are:
* Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault
* Conrad Veidt as Major Heinrich Strasser. Veidt was a refugee German actor who had fled the Nazis with his Jewish wife, but frequently played Nazis in American films. He was the highest paid member of the cast despite his second billing. He died shortly after the film&#x27;s release.
* Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari
* Peter Lorre as Signor Ugarte

Also credited are:
* Curt Bois as the pickpocket. Bois had one of the longest careers in cinema, spanning over 80 years.
* Leonid Kinskey as Sascha, the Russian bartender infatuated with Yvonne. Kinskey told Aljean Harmetz, author of &quot;Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca&quot;, that he was cast because he was Bogart&#x27;s drinking buddy. He was not the first choice for the role; he replaced Leo Mostovoy, who was deemed not funny enough.
* Madeleine Lebeau as Yvonne, Rick&#x27;s soon-discarded girlfriend. Lebeau was a French refugee who had left Nazi-occupied Europe with her husband Marcel Dalio, who was a fellow &quot;Casablanca&quot; performer. She was the last surviving cast member until her death on May 1, 2016.
* Joy Page, the stepdaughter of studio head Jack L. Warner, as Annina Brandel, the young Bulgarian refugee
* John Qualen as Berger, Laszlo&#x27;s Resistance contact
* S. Z. Sakall (credited as S. K. Sakall) as Carl, the waiter
* Dooley Wilson as Sam. Wilson was one of the few American-born members of the cast. A drummer, he had to fake playing the piano. Even after shooting had been completed, producer Wallis considered dubbing over Wilson&#x27;s voice for the songs.

Notable uncredited actors are:
* Marcel Dalio as Emil the croupier. Dalio had been a star in French cinema, appearing in Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; and &quot;La Règle du Jeu&quot;.
* Helmut Dantine as Jan Brandel, the Bulgarian roulette player married to Annina Brandel
* Gregory Gaye as the German banker who is refused entry to the casino by Rick
* Torben Meyer as the Dutch banker who runs &quot;the second largest banking house in Amsterdam&quot;
* Corinna Mura as the guitar player who sings &quot;Tango Delle Rose&quot; (or &quot;Tango de la Rosa&quot;) and later accompanies the crowd on &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;
* Frank Puglia as a Moroccan rug merchant
* Richard Ryen as Colonel Heinze, Strasser&#x27;s aide
* Dan Seymour as Abdul the doorman
* Gerald Oliver Smith as the Englishman whose wallet is stolen
* Norma Varden as the Englishwoman whose husband has his wallet stolen

Much of the emotional impact of the film, for the audience in 1942, has been attributed to the large proportion of European exiles and refugees who were extras or played minor roles (in addition to leading actors Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre), such as Louis V. Arco, Trude Berliner, Ilka Grünig, Ludwig Stössel, Hans Heinrich von Twardowski, and Wolfgang Zilzer. A witness to the filming of the &quot;duel of the anthems&quot; sequence said he saw many of the actors crying and &quot;realized that they were all real refugees&quot;. Harmetz argues that they &quot;brought to a dozen small roles in &quot;Casablanca&quot; an understanding and a desperation that could never have come from Central Casting&quot;. Even though many were Jewish or refugees from the Nazis (or both), they were frequently cast as Nazis in various war films, because of their accents.

Jack Benny may have appeared in an unbilled cameo, as was claimed by a contemporary newspaper advertisement and in the &quot;Casablanca&quot; press book. When asked in his column &quot;Movie Answer Man&quot;, critic Roger Ebert first replied, &quot;It looks something like him. That&#x27;s all I can say.&quot; In a later column, he responded to a follow-up commenter, &quot;I think you&#x27;re right. The Jack Benny Fan Club can feel vindicated&quot;.

== Writing ==
The film was based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison&#x27;s unproduced play &quot;Everybody Comes to Rick&#x27;s&quot;. The Warner Bros. story analyst who read the play, Stephen Karnot, called it (approvingly) &quot;sophisticated hokum&quot; and story editor Irene Diamond, who had discovered the script on a trip to New York in 1941, convinced Hal Wallis to buy the rights in January 1942 for $20,000 (), the most anyone in Hollywood had ever paid for an unproduced play. The project was renamed &quot;Casablanca&quot;, apparently in imitation of the 1938 hit &quot;Algiers&quot;. &quot;Casablanca&quot; also shares many narrative and thematic similarities with &quot;Algiers&quot; &quot;(1938)&quot;, which itself is a remake of the acclaimed 1937 French film &quot;Pépé le Moko&quot;, directed and co-written by Julien Duvivier.

The original play was inspired by a trip to Europe made by Murray Burnett and his wife in 1938, during which they visited Vienna shortly after the Anschluss and were affected by the antisemitism they saw. In the south of France, they went to a nightclub that had a multinational clientele, among them many exiles and refugees, and the prototype of Sam. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Paul Fairclough wrote that Cinema Vox in Tangier &quot;was Africa&#x27;s biggest when it opened in 1935, with 2,000 seats and a retractable roof. As Tangier was in Spanish territory, the theatre&#x27;s wartime bar heaved with spies, refugees and underworld hoods, securing its place in cinematic history as the inspiration for Rick&#x27;s Café in &quot;Casablanca&quot;.&quot; The scene of the singing of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in the bar is attributed by the film scholar Julian Jackson as an adaptation of a similar scene from Jean Renoir&#x27;s film &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; five years prior.

The first writers assigned to the script were twins Julius and Philip Epstein who, against the wishes of Warner Bros., left at Frank Capra&#x27;s request early in 1942 to work on the &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series in Washington, D.C. While they were gone, the other credited writer, Howard Koch, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were reassigned to &quot;Casablanca&quot; and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, () and Koch earned $4,200 ().

In the play, the Ilsa character is an American named Lois Meredith; she does not meet Laszlo until after her relationship with Rick in Paris has ended. Rick is a lawyer. The play (set entirely in the café) ends with Rick sending Lois and Laszlo to the airport. To make Rick&#x27;s motivation more believable, Wallis, Curtiz, and the screenwriters decided to set the film before the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The possibility was discussed of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Casey Robinson wrote to Wallis before filming began, the ending of the film is

set up for a swell twist when Rick sends her away on the plane with Laszlo. For now, in doing so, he is not just solving a love triangle. He is forcing the girl to live up to the idealism of her nature, forcing her to carry on with the work that in these days is far more important than the love of two little people.

It was certainly impossible for Ilsa to leave Laszlo for Rick, as the Motion Picture Production Code forbade showing a woman leaving her husband for another man. The concern was not whether Ilsa would leave with Laszlo, but how this outcome would be engineered. According to Julius Epstein, he and Philip were driving when they simultaneously came up with the idea for Renault to order the roundup of &quot;the usual suspects&quot;, after which all the details needed for resolution of the story, including the farewell between Bergman and &quot;a suddenly noble Bogart&quot;, were rapidly worked out.

The uncredited Casey Robinson assisted with three weeks of rewrites, including contributing the series of meetings between Rick and Ilsa in the café. Koch highlighted the political and melodramatic elements, and Curtiz seems to have favored the romantic parts, insisting on retaining the Paris flashbacks.

In a telegram to film editor Owen Marks on August 7, 1942, Wallis suggested two possible final lines of dialogue for Rick: &quot;Louis, I might have known you&#x27;d mix your patriotism with a little larceny&quot; or &quot;Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship&quot;. Two weeks later, Wallis settled on the latter, which Bogart was recalled to dub a month after shooting had finished.

Bogart&#x27;s line &quot;Here&#x27;s looking at you, kid&quot;, said four times, was not in the draft screenplays, but has been attributed to a comment he made to Bergman as she played poker with her English coach and hairdresser between takes.

Despite the many writers, the film has what Ebert describes as a &quot;wonderfully unified and consistent&quot; script. Koch later claimed it was the tension between his own approach and Curtiz&#x27;s that had accounted for this. &quot;Surprisingly, these disparate approaches somehow meshed, and perhaps it was partly this tug of war between Curtiz and me that gave the film a certain balance.&quot; Julius Epstein later noted the screenplay contained &quot;more corn than in the states of Kansas and Iowa combined. But when corn works, there&#x27;s nothing better&quot;.

The film ran into some trouble with Joseph Breen of the Production Code Administration (the Hollywood self-censorship body), who opposed the suggestions that Captain Renault extorted sexual favors from visa applicants, and that Rick and Ilsa had slept together. Extensive changes were made, with several lines of dialogue removed or altered. All direct references to sex were deleted; Renault&#x27;s selling of visas for sex, and Rick and Ilsa&#x27;s previous sexual relationship were implied elliptically rather than referenced explicitly. Also, in the original script, when Sam plays &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, Rick exclaims, &quot;What the —— are you playing?&quot; This line was altered to &quot;Sam, I thought I told you never to play ...&quot; to conform to Breen&#x27;s objection to an implied swear word.

== Production ==
Although an initial filming date was selected for April 10, 1942, delays led to production starting on May 25. Filming was completed on August 3. It went $75,000 over budget for a total cost of $1,039,000 (), above average for the time. Unusually, the film was shot in sequence, mainly because only the first half of the script was ready when filming began.

The entire picture was shot in the studio except for the sequence showing Strasser&#x27;s arrival and close-ups of the Lockheed Electra (filmed at Van Nuys Airport) and a few short clips of stock footage views of Paris. The street used for the exterior shots had recently been built for another film, &quot;The Desert Song&quot;, and redressed for the Paris flashbacks.

The film critic Roger Ebert called Wallis the &quot;key creative force&quot; for his attention to the details of production (down to insisting on a real parrot in the Blue Parrot bar).

The difference between Bergman&#x27;s and Bogart&#x27;s height caused some problems. She was two inches (5 cm) taller than Bogart, and claimed Curtiz had Bogart stand on blocks or sit on cushions in their scenes together.

Later, there were plans for a further scene, showing Rick, Renault and a detachment of Free French soldiers on a ship, to incorporate the Allies&#x27; 1942 invasion of North Africa. It proved too difficult to get Claude Rains for the shoot, and the scene was finally abandoned after David O. Selznick judged &quot;it would be a terrible mistake to change the ending&quot;.

The background of the final scene, which shows a Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior airplane with personnel walking around it, was staged using little person extras and a proportionate cardboard plane. Fog was used to mask the model&#x27;s unconvincing appearance.

=== Direction ===
Wallis&#x27;s first choice for director was William Wyler, but he was unavailable, so Wallis turned to his close friend Michael Curtiz. Roger Ebert has commented that in &quot;Casablanca&quot; &quot;very few shots ...are memorable as shots&quot;, as Curtiz wanted images to express the story rather than to stand alone. He contributed relatively little to development of the plot. Casey Robinson said Curtiz &quot;knew nothing whatever about story ...he saw it in pictures, and you supplied the stories&quot;.

Critic Andrew Sarris called the film &quot;the most decisive exception to the auteur theory&quot;, of which Sarris was the most prominent proponent in the United States. Aljean Harmetz has responded, &quot;...nearly every Warner Bros. picture was an exception to the auteur theory&quot;. Other critics give more credit to Curtiz. Sidney Rosenzweig, in his study of the director&#x27;s work, sees the film as a typical example of Curtiz&#x27;s highlighting of moral dilemmas.

Some of the second unit montages, such as the opening sequence of the refugee trail and the invasion of France, were directed by Don Siegel.

=== Cinematography ===
The cinematographer was Arthur Edeson, a veteran who had previously shot &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Particular attention was paid to photographing Bergman. She was shot mainly from her preferred left side, often with a softening gauze filter and with catch lights to make her eyes sparkle; the whole effect was designed to make her face seem &quot;ineffably sad and tender and nostalgic&quot;. Bars of shadow across the characters and in the background variously imply imprisonment, the Cross of Lorraine—the symbol of the Free French Forces—and emotional turmoil. Dark film noir and expressionist lighting was used in several scenes, particularly towards the end of the picture. Rosenzweig argues these shadow and lighting effects are classic elements of the Curtiz style, along with the fluid camera work and the use of the environment as a framing device.

== Soundtrack ==
The music was written by Max Steiner, who wrote scores for &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. The song &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to write his own composition to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role (María in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;) and could not reshoot the scenes that incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it and &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, the French national anthem, transforming them as leitmotifs to reflect changing moods. Even though Steiner disliked &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, he admitted in a 1943 interview that it &quot;must have had something to attract so much attention&quot;. Dooley Wilson, who played Sam, was a drummer but not a pianist, so his piano playing was performed by Jean Plummer.

Particularly memorable is the &quot;duel of the anthems&quot; between Strasser and Laszlo at Rick&#x27;s café. In the soundtrack, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; is played by a full orchestra. Originally, the opposing piece for this iconic sequence was to be the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;, a Nazi anthem, but this was still under international copyright in non-Allied countries. Instead &quot;Die Wacht am Rhein&quot; was used. The &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot;, the national anthem of Germany, is used several times in minor mode as a leitmotif for the German threat, e.g. in the scene in Paris as it is announced that the German army will reach Paris the next day. It is featured in the final scene, giving way to &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; after Strasser is shot.

Other songs include:
* &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;, music by Isham Jones, lyrics by Gus Kahn
* &quot;Shine&quot;, music by Ford Dabney, lyrics by Cecil Mack and Lew Brown
* &quot;Avalon&quot;, music and lyrics by Al Jolson, Buddy DeSylva and Vincent Rose
* &quot;Perfidia&quot;, by Alberto Domínguez
* &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot;, by Ray Noble
* &quot;Knock on Wood&quot;, music by M. K. Jerome, lyrics by Jack Scholl, the only original song
* &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Harry&quot;, by Eubie Blake
* &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, by Jimmy Van Heusen
* &quot;Parlez-moi d&#x27;amour&quot;, by Jean Lenoir
* &quot;Love for Sale&quot;, by Cole Porter

Very few films in the early 1940s had portions of the soundtrack released on 78 rpm records, and &quot;Casablanca&quot; was no exception. In 1997, almost 55 years after the film&#x27;s premiere, Turner Entertainment in collaboration with Rhino Records issued the film&#x27;s first original soundtrack album for release on compact disc, including original songs and music, spoken dialogue, and alternate takes.

The piano featured in the Paris flashback sequences was sold in New York City on December 14, 2012, at Sotheby&#x27;s for more than $600,000 to an anonymous bidder. The piano Sam &quot;plays&quot; in Rick&#x27;s Café Américain, put up for auction with other film memorabilia by Turner Classic Movies at Bonhams in New York on November 24, 2014, sold for $3.4 million.

== Release ==
Although an initial release date was anticipated for early 1943, &quot;Casablanca&quot; premiered at the Hollywood Theater in New York City on November 26, 1942, to capitalize on Operation Torch (the Allied invasion of French North Africa) and the capture of Casablanca. It went into general release on January 23, 1943, to take advantage of the Casablanca Conference, a high-level meeting in the city between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Office of War Information prevented screening of the film to troops in North Africa, believing it would cause resentment among Vichy supporters in the region.

=== Irish and German cuts ===
On March 19, 1943, the film was banned in Ireland for infringing on the Emergency Powers Order preserving wartime neutrality, by portraying Vichy France and Nazi Germany in a &quot;sinister light&quot;. It was passed with cuts on June 15, 1945, shortly after the EPO was lifted. The cuts were made to dialogue between Rick and Ilsa referring to their love affair. A version with only one scene cut was passed on July 16, 1974; Irish national broadcaster RTÉ inquired about showing the film on TV, but found it still required a dialogue cut to Ilsa expressing her love for Rick.

Warner Brothers released a heavily edited version of &quot;Casablanca&quot; in West Germany in 1952. All scenes with Nazis were removed, along with most references to World War II. Important plot points were altered when the dialogue was dubbed into German. Victor Laszlo was no longer a Resistance fighter who escaped from a Nazi concentration camp. Instead, he became a Norwegian atomic physicist who was being pursued by Interpol after he &quot;broke out of jail&quot;. The West German version was 25 minutes shorter than the original cut. A German version of &quot;Casablanca&quot; with the original plot was not released until 1975.

== Reception ==
=== Initial response ===
&quot;Casablanca&quot; received &quot;consistently good reviews&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The Warners ... have a picture which makes the spine tingle and the heart take a leap.&quot; He applauded the combination of &quot;sentiment, humor and pathos with taut melodrama and bristling intrigue.&quot; Crowther noted its &quot;devious convolutions of the plot&quot; and praised the screenplay quality as &quot;of the best&quot; and the cast&#x27;s performances as &quot;all of the first order&quot;.

The trade paper &quot;Variety&quot; commended the film&#x27;s &quot;combination of fine performances, engrossing story and neat direction&quot; and the &quot;variety of moods, action, suspense, comedy and drama that makes &quot;Casablanca&quot; an A-1 entry at the b.o.&quot; The review observed that the &quot;[f]ilm is splendid anti-Axis propaganda, particularly inasmuch as the propaganda is strictly a by-product of the principal action and contributes to it instead of getting in the way&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; also applauded the performances of Bergman and Henreid and noted, &quot;Bogart, as might be expected, is more at ease as the bitter and cynical operator of a joint than as a lover, but handles both assignments with superb finesse.&quot;

Some reviews were less enthusiastic. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; rated &quot;Casablanca&quot; only &quot;pretty tolerable&quot; and said it was &quot;not quite up to &quot;Across the Pacific&quot;, Bogart&#x27;s last spyfest&quot;.

At the 1,500-seat Hollywood Theater, the film grossed $255,000 over ten weeks (equivalent to $ in ). In its initial American release, &quot;Casablanca&quot; was a substantial, but not spectacular, box-office success, earning $3.7 million (equivalent to $ in ). A 50th-anniversary release grossed in 1992. According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $3,398,000 domestically and $3,461,000 in foreign markets.

=== Popularity ===
In the decades since its release, the film has grown in reputation. Murray Burnett called it &quot;true yesterday, true today, true tomorrow&quot;. By 1955, the film had brought in $6.8 million, making it the third-most-successful of Warners&#x27; wartime movies, behind &quot;Shine On, Harvest Moon&quot; and &quot;This Is the Army&quot;. On April 21, 1957, the Brattle Theater of Cambridge, Massachusetts, showed the film as part of a season of old movies. It proved so popular that a tradition began in which &quot;Casablanca&quot; would be screened during the week of final exams at Harvard University. Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology who had attended one of these screenings, has said that the experience was &quot;the acting out of my own personal rite of passage&quot;. The tradition helped the film remain popular while other films that had been famous in the 1940s have faded from popular memory. By 1977, &quot;Casablanca&quot; had become the most frequently broadcast film on American television.

Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s portrayal of Ilsa Lund in &quot;Casablanca&quot; became one of her best-known roles. In later years she said, &quot;I feel about &quot;Casablanca&quot; that it has a life of its own. There is something mystical about it. It seems to have filled a need, a need that was there before the film, a need that the film filled.&quot;

On the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;Casablanca&quot;s great strength &quot;the purity of its Golden Age Hollywoodness [and] the enduring craftsmanship of its resonantly hokey dialogue&quot;. Bob Strauss wrote in the newspaper that the film achieved a &quot;near-perfect entertainment balance&quot; of comedy, romance, and suspense.

Roger Ebert wrote of &quot;Casablanca&quot; in 1992, &quot;There are greater movies. More profound movies. Movies of greater artistic vision or artistic originality or political significance. ... But [it is] one of the movies we treasure the most ... This is a movie that has transcended the ordinary categories.&quot; In his opinion, the film is popular because &quot;the people in it are all so good&quot; and it is &quot;a wonderful gem&quot;. Ebert said that he had never heard of a negative review of the film, even though individual elements can be criticized, citing unrealistic special effects and the stiff character of Laszlo as portrayed by Paul Henreid.

Critic and film historian Leonard Maltin considers &quot;Casablanca&quot; &quot;the best Hollywood movie of all time&quot;.

According to Rudy Behlmer, the character of Rick is &quot;not a hero ... not a bad guy&quot; because he does what is necessary to appease the authorities and &quot;sticks his neck out for nobody&quot;. Behlmer feels that the other characters are &quot;not cut and dried&quot; and come into their goodness over the course of the film. Renault begins as a collaborator with the Nazis who extorts sexual favors from refugees and has Ugarte killed. Even Ilsa, the least active of the main characters, is &quot;caught in the emotional struggle&quot; over which man she really loves. By the end, however, &quot;everybody is sacrificing&quot;. Behlmer also emphasized the variety in the picture. &quot;It&#x27;s a blend of drama, melodrama, comedy [and] intrigue.&quot;

Scott Tobias, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; on the film&#x27;s 80th anniversary, calls it &quot;the jewel of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age&quot;, and the best example of the system of film-making working: due not to an artistic genius but a combination of talented writing, set design, music, casting, supporting characters, and production.

A few reviewers have expressed reservations. To Pauline Kael, &quot;It&#x27;s far from a great film, but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism ...&quot; Umberto Eco wrote that &quot;by any strict critical standards ... &quot;Casablanca&quot; is a very mediocre film&quot;. He viewed the changes that the characters manifest as inconsistent rather than complex. &quot;It is a comic strip, a hotchpotch, low on psychological credibility, and with little continuity in its dramatic effects.&quot; However, he added that because of the presence of multiple archetypes that allow &quot;the power of Narrative in its natural state without Art intervening to discipline it&quot;, it is a film reaching &quot;Homeric depths&quot; as a &quot;phenomenon worthy of awe&quot;.

 The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;An undisputed masterpiece and perhaps Hollywood&#x27;s quintessential statement on love and romance, Casablanca has only improved with age, boasting career-defining performances from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.&quot;
On Metacritic, the film has a perfect score of 100 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. It is one of the few films in the site&#x27;s history to achieve a perfect aggregate score.

In the November/December 1982 issue of &quot;Film Comment&quot;, Chuck Ross wrote that he retyped the &quot;Casablanca&quot; screenplay, reverting the title to &quot;Everybody Comes to Rick&#x27;s&quot; and changing the name of Sam the piano player to Dooley (after Dooley Wilson, who played the character), and submitted it to 217 agencies. The majority of agencies returned the script unread (often because of policies regarding unsolicited screenplays) or did not respond. However, of those which did respond, only 33 specifically recognized it as &quot;Casablanca&quot;. Eight others observed that it was similar to &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and 41 agencies rejected the screenplay outright, offering comments such as &quot;Too much dialogue, not enough exposition, the story line was weak, and in general didn&#x27;t hold my interest.&quot; Three agencies offered to represent the screenplay, and one suggested turning it into a novel.

Ebert wrote: Seeing the film over and over again, year after year, I find it never grows overfamiliar. It plays like a familiar musical album: the more I know it, the more I like it. The black-and-white cinematography has not aged as color would. The dialogue is so spare and cynical it has not grown old-fashioned. Much of the emotional effect of &quot;Casablanca&quot; is achieved by indirection. As we leave the theater, we are absolutely convinced that the only thing keeping the world from going crazy is the concerns of three little people who do, after all, amount to more than a hill of beans.&quot;
=== Influence on later works ===
Many subsequent films have drawn on elements of &quot;Casablanca&quot;. &quot;Passage to Marseille&quot; (1944) reunited actors Bogart, Rains, Greenstreet, and Lorre and director Curtiz in 1944, and there are similarities between &quot;Casablanca&quot; and a later Bogart film, &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (also 1944). Parodies have included the Marx Brothers&#x27; &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; (1946), Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978), and &quot;Out Cold&quot; (2001). Indirectly, it provided the title for the 1995 neo-noir film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot; (1972) appropriated Rick Blaine as the fantasy mentor for Allen&#x27;s character.

The film was a plot device in the science-fiction television movie &quot;Overdrawn at the Memory Bank&quot; (1983), based on John Varley&#x27;s story. The story&#x27;s protagonist recreates settings from the film inside a virtual reality simulation, including a version of Rick who becomes an advisor and ally (both characters are played by lead actor Raul Julia).

It was referred to in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s dystopian &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985). Warner Bros. produced its own parody: &quot;Carrotblanca&quot;, a 1995 Bugs Bunny cartoon. The film critic Roger Ebert pointed out the plot of the film &quot;Barb Wire&quot; (1996) was identical to that of &quot;Casablanca&quot;. In &quot;Casablanca&quot;, a novella by Argentine writer Edgar Brau, the protagonist somehow wanders into Rick&#x27;s Café Américain and listens to a strange tale related by Sam. The 2016 musical film &quot;La La Land&quot; contains allusions to &quot;Casablanca&quot; in the imagery, dialogue, and plot. Robert Zemeckis, director of &quot;Allied&quot; (2016), which is also set in 1942 Casablanca, studied the film to capture the city&#x27;s elegance. The 2017 Moroccan drama film &quot;Razzia&quot;, directed by Nabil Ayouch, is mostly set in the city of Casablanca, and its characters frequently discuss the 1942 film.

=== Awards and honors ===
Because of its November 1942 release, the New York Film Critics decided to include the film in its 1942 award season for best picture. &quot;Casablanca&quot; lost to &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;. However, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences stated that since the film went into national release at the beginning of 1943, it would be included in that year&#x27;s nominations. &quot;Casablanca&quot; was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and won three.

As Bogart stepped out of his car at the awards ceremony, &quot;the crowd surged forward, almost engulfing him and his wife, Mayo Methot. It took 12 police officers to rescue the two, and a red-faced, startled, yet smiling Bogart heard a chorus of cries of &#x27;good luck&#x27; and &#x27;here&#x27;s looking at you, kid&#x27; as he was rushed into the theater&quot;.

When the award for Best Picture was announced, producer Hal B. Wallis got up to accept, but studio head Jack L. Warner rushed up to the stage &quot;with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction&quot;, Wallis later recalled.

I couldn&#x27;t believe it was happening. &quot;Casablanca&quot; had been my creation; Jack had absolutely nothing to do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious ... Almost forty years later, I still haven&#x27;t recovered from the shock.

This incident led Wallis to leave Warner Bros. in April.

In 1989, the film was one of the first 25 films selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2005, it was named one of the 100 greatest films of the last 80 years by &quot;Time&quot; magazine (the selected films were not ranked). &quot;Bright Lights Film Journal&quot; stated in 2007, &quot;It is one of those rare films from Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age which has managed to transcend its era to entertain generations of moviegoers ... &quot;Casablanca&quot; provides twenty-first-century Americans with an oasis of hope in a desert of arbitrary cruelty and senseless violence.&quot;

The film also ranked at number 28 on &quot;Empire&quot;″s list of the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, which said, &quot;Love, honour, thrills, wisecracks and a hit tune are among the attractions, which also include a perfect supporting cast of villains, sneaks, thieves, refugees and bar staff. But it&#x27;s Bogart and Bergman&#x27;s show, entering immortality as screen lovers reunited only to part. The irrefutible [&quot;sic&quot;] proof that great movies are accidents.&quot;

Screenwriting teacher Robert McKee maintains that the script is &quot;the greatest screenplay of all time&quot;. In 2006, the Writers Guild of America, West agreed, voting it the best ever in its list of the 101 greatest screenplays.

The film has been selected by the American Film Institute for many of their lists of important American films:

== Interpretation ==
&quot;Casablanca&quot; has been subjected to many readings; semioticians account for the film&#x27;s popularity by claiming that its inclusion of stereotypes paradoxically strengthens the film. Umberto Eco wrote:

Eco also singled out sacrifice as a theme: &quot;the myth of sacrifice runs through the whole film&quot;. It was this theme that resonated with a wartime audience who were reassured by the idea that painful sacrifice and going off to war could be romantic gestures done for the greater good.

Koch also considered the film a political allegory. Rick is compared to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who gambled &quot;on the odds of going to war until circumstance and his own submerged nobility force him to close his casino (partisan politics) and commit himself—first by financing the Side of Right and then by fighting for it&quot;. The connection is reinforced by the film&#x27;s title, which means &quot;white house&quot;.

Harvey Greenberg presents a Freudian reading in his &quot;The Movies on Your Mind&quot;, in which the transgressions that prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins to identify with the father figure of Laszlo and the cause that he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that the most important aspect of the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names that each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings that he has for each person.

== Home media ==
&quot;Casablanca&quot; was initially released on Betamax and VHS by Magnetic Video and later by CBS/Fox Video (as United Artists owned the distribution rights at the time). In 1989, the Criterion Collection released a Laserdisc release sourced from a nitrate print that includes supplements such as an audio commentary by Ronald Haver, a treatment for an unreleased sequel and wartime footage of the city of Casablanca. Criterion would issue a CLV version of this in 1991 with only the film and commentary. It was next released on laserdisc in 1991, and on VHS in 1992—both from MGM/UA Home Entertainment (distributing for Turner Entertainment Co.), which at the time was distributed by Warner Home Video. It was first released on DVD in 1998 by MGM, containing the trailer and a making-of featurette (Warner Home Video reissued the DVD in 2000). A subsequent two-disc special edition, containing an audio commentary by Roger Ebert, documentaries, &quot;Carrotblanca&quot; and a newly remastered visual and audio presentation, was released in 2003.

An HD DVD was released on November 14, 2006, containing the same special features as the 2003 DVD. Reviewers were impressed with the new high-definition transfer of the film.

A Blu-ray release with new special features came out on December 2, 2008; it is also available on DVD. The Blu-ray was initially only released as an expensive gift set with a booklet, a luggage tag and other assorted gift-type items. It was eventually released as a stand-alone Blu-ray in September 2009. On March 27, 2012, Warner released a new 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition Blu-ray/DVD combo set. It includes a brand-new 4K restoration and new bonus material. This 4K restoration was completed at Warner Bros. Digital Imaging from a nitrate print, because the original negative no longer exists.

The film was also released on Ultra HD Blu-ray in November 8, 2022.

== Remakes and unrealized sequels ==
Almost from the moment &quot;Casablanca&quot; became a hit, talk began of producing a sequel. One titled &quot;Brazzaville&quot; (in the final scene, Renault recommends fleeing to that Free French-held city) was planned, but never produced. A newspaper article at the time mentioned that Bogart and Greenstreet &quot;will continue their characterizations from the first film, and it&#x27;s likely that Geraldine Fitzgerald will have an important role&quot;. Since then, no studio has seriously considered filming a sequel or outright remake.

François Truffaut refused an invitation to remake the film in 1974, citing its cult status among American students as his reason. Attempts to recapture the magic of &quot;Casablanca&quot; in other settings, such as &quot;Caboblanco&quot; (1980), &quot;a South American-set retooling of &quot;Casablanca&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Havana&quot; (1990) have been poorly received.

Stories of a &quot;Casablanca&quot; remake or sequel nonetheless persist. In 2008, Madonna was reported to be pursuing a remake set in modern-day Iraq. In 2012, both &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported on efforts by Cass Warner, granddaughter of Harry Warner and friend of the late Howard Koch, to produce a sequel featuring the search by Rick Blaine and Ilsa Lund&#x27;s illegitimate son for the whereabouts of his biological father.

== Adaptations ==
On radio, there were several adaptations of the film. The two best-known are a thirty-minute adaptation on &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; on April 26, 1943, starring Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid, and an hour-long version on the &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; on January 24, 1944, featuring Alan Ladd as Rick, Hedy Lamarr as Ilsa, and John Loder as Laszlo. Two other thirty-minute adaptations were aired, one on &quot;Philip Morris Playhouse&quot; on September 3, 1943, and the other on &quot;Theater of Romance&quot; on December 19, 1944, in which Dooley Wilson reprised his role as Sam.

On television, there have been two short-lived series based upon &quot;Casablanca&quot;, both sharing the title. The first &quot;Casablanca&quot; aired on ABC as part of the wheel series &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot; in hour-long episodes from 1955 to 1956. It was a Cold War espionage program set contemporaneously with its production, and starred Charles McGraw as Rick and Marcel Dalio, who had played Emil the croupier in the movie, as the police chief. The second &quot;Casablanca&quot;, broadcast on NBC in April 1983, starred David Soul as Rick and was canceled after three weeks.

The novel &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, written by Michael Walsh and published in 1998, was authorized by Warner. The novel picks up where the film leaves off, and also tells of Rick&#x27;s mysterious past in America. The book met with little success. David Thomson provided an unofficial sequel in his 1985 novel &quot;Suspects&quot;.

Julius Epstein made two attempts to turn the film into a Broadway musical, in 1951 and 1967, but neither made it to the stage. The original play, &quot;Everybody Comes to Rick&#x27;s&quot;, was produced in Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1946, and again in London in April 1991, but met with no success. The film was adapted into a musical by the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female Japanese musical theater company, and ran from November 2009 through February 2010.

&quot;CasablancaBox&quot;, written by Sara Farrington and directed by Reid Farrington, premiered in New York in 2017 and was an imagined &quot;making of&quot; the film. It was nominated for two 2017 Drama Desk awards, Unique Theatrical Experience and Outstanding Projection Design. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a brave, almost foolhardy undertaking, presenting the backstage drama during the making of &quot;Casablanca&quot;&quot;.

== Colorization ==

&quot;Casablanca&quot; was part of the film colorization controversy of the 1980s, when a colorized version aired on the television network WTBS. In 1984, MGM/UA hired Color Systems Technology to colorize the film for $180,000. When Ted Turner of Turner Broadcasting System purchased MGM/UA&#x27;s film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American Film Technologies (AFT) in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000. Turner later reacted to criticism of the colorization, saying, &quot;[&quot;Casablanca&quot;] is one of a handful of films that really doesn&#x27;t have to be colorized. I did it because I wanted to. All I&#x27;m trying to do is protect my investment.&quot;

The Library of Congress deemed that the color change differed so much from the original film that it gave a new copyright to Turner Entertainment. When the colorized film debuted on WTBS, it was watched by three million viewers, not making the top-ten viewed cable shows for the week. Although Jack Matthews of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the finished product &quot;state of the art&quot;, it was mostly met with negative critical reception. It was briefly available on home video. Gary Edgerton, writing for the &quot;Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television&quot; criticized the colorization, stating that &quot;&quot;Casablanca&quot; in color ended up being much blander in appearance and, overall, much less visually interesting than its 1942 predecessor.&quot; Bogart&#x27;s son, Stephen, said, &quot;if you&#x27;re going to colorize &quot;Casablanca&quot;, why not put arms on the Venus de Milo?&quot;

== Inaccuracies and a misquote ==
Several unfounded rumors and misconceptions have grown up around the film, one being that Ronald Reagan was originally chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio early on in the film&#x27;s development. By that time the studio already knew that he was going into the Army and he was never seriously considered. George Raft claimed that he had turned down the lead role but studio records make it clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.

Another story is that the actors did not know until the last day of shooting how the film was to end. Koch later acknowledged:
When we began, we didn&#x27;t have a finished script ... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, &quot;Which man should I love more ...?&quot; I said to her, &quot;I don&#x27;t know ... play them both evenly.&quot; You see we didn&#x27;t have an ending, so we didn&#x27;t know what was going to happen!
While rewrites did occur during filming, Aljean Harmetz&#x27;s examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end; any confusion was, according to critic Roger Ebert, &quot;emotional&quot;, not &quot;factual&quot;.

The film has several logical flaws, one being the two &quot;letters of transit&quot; that enable their bearers to leave Vichy French territory. Ugarte says the letters had been signed by (depending on the listener) either Vichy General Weygand or Free French General de Gaulle. The French subtitles on the official DVD read Weygand; the English ones specify de Gaulle. Weygand had been the Vichy delegate-general for the North African colonies until November 1941, a month before the film is set. De Gaulle was the head of the Free French government in exile, so a letter signed by him would have provided no benefit. The letters were invented as a MacGuffin by Joan Alison for the original play and never questioned.

In the same vein, though Laszlo asserts that the Nazis cannot arrest him, saying, &quot;This is still unoccupied France; any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault&quot;, Ebert points out, &quot;It makes no sense that he could walk around freely. ... He would be arrested on sight.&quot; No uniformed German troops were stationed in Casablanca during World War II, and neither American nor French troops occupied Berlin in 1918, despite Renault&#x27;s retort to Strasser, who calls Rick a &quot;blundering American&quot;.

A line closely associated with &quot;Casablanca&quot;—&quot;Play it again, Sam&quot;—is not spoken in the film. When Ilsa first enters the Café Américain, she spots Sam and asks him, &quot;Play it once, Sam, for old times&#x27; sake.&quot; After he feigns ignorance, she responds, &quot;Play it, Sam. Play &#x27;As Time Goes By&#x27;.&quot; Later that night, alone with Sam, Rick says, &quot;You played it for her, you can play it for me&quot;, and &quot;If she can stand it, I can! Play it!&quot;

<text>Cigarette cards are trading cards issued by tobacco manufacturers to stiffen cigarette packaging and advertise cigarette brands.

Between 1875 and the 1940s, cigarette companies often included collectible cards with their packages of cigarettes. Cigarette card sets document popular culture from the turn of the century, often depicting the period&#x27;s actresses, costumes, and sports, as well as offering insights into mainstream humour and cultural norms.

==History==
Beginning in 1879, cards depicting actresses, baseball players, Native American chiefs, boxers, national flags, or wild animals were issued by the U.S.-based Allen &amp; Ginter tobacco company. These are considered to be some of the first cigarette cards. Other tobacco companies such as Goodwin &amp; Co. soon followed suit. They first emerged in the U.S., then the UK, then, eventually, in many other countries.
In the UK, W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills in 1887 were one of the first companies to include advertising cards with their cigarettes, but it was John Player &amp; Sons in 1893 that produced one of the first general interest sets &#x27;Castles and Abbeys&#x27;.


Thomas Ogden of Liverpool soon followed in 1894 and in 1895, Wills produced their first set &#x27;Ships and Sailors&#x27;. In 1896 Wills produced the first set in the United Kingdom with a sporting theme called &#x27;Cricketers&#x27;. In 1906, Ogden&#x27;s produced a set of association football cards depicting footballers in their club colours, in one of the first full-colour sets.

Each set of cards typically consisted of 25 or 50 related subjects, but series of over 100 cards per issue are known. Popular themes were &#x27;beauties&#x27; (famous actresses, film stars and models), sporters (in the U.S. mainly baseball, in the rest of the world mainly football and cricket), nature, military heroes and uniforms, heraldry, locomotives, and city views.

Imperial Tobacco Canada manufactured the first ice hockey cards ever for the inaugural NHL season. There were a total of 36 cards in the set, each one featured an illustration of a player. After World War I, only one more cigarette set was issued, during 1924–25.

Today, for example, sports and military historians study these cards for details on uniform design.

Some very early cigarette cards were printed on silk which was then attached to a paper backing. They were discontinued in order to save paper during World War II, and never fully reintroduced thereafter.

Doral, an R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company brand, started printing cigarette cards in the year 2000. These were the first cigarette cards from a major manufacturer since the 1940s, although the small company Carreras in the UK issued cigarette cards with Turf brand cigarettes for a short period in the 1950s and 1960s, Black Cat brand in 1976. Furthermore, card-like coupons with special offers have often been included in cigarette packets over the years.

The first set of &quot;Doral Celebrate America&quot; cards featured the 50 states in two releases, 2000 and 2001. Later themes include American festivals, cars, national parks, and 20th century events.

Natural American Spirit, another R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company brand, also includes cigarette cards on their packs, with information on such things as windpower, diversity, and their farmers.

Philip Morris USA started including &quot;Information For Smokers&quot; cigarette cards in certain packs. One provides information on quitting smoking and the other states that &quot;Light, &quot;Ultra Light&quot;, &quot;Mild&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, and &quot;Low Tar&quot; cigarettes are just as harmful as &quot;Full Flavor&quot; ones.

==Classification and cataloguing==
The system devised to codify 19th Century American tobacco issues has its origin in the &#x27;American Card Catalog&#x27; (ACC), written by Jefferson Burdick. Burdick listed the American Tobacco cards in one section, broken down by companies that issued the card series and by the types of cards. The 19th Century issues were prefixed with &#x27;N&#x27; (N1-N694) and the 20th with &#x27;T&#x27;. (T1-T235).

===The World Tobacco Index (WTI)===
The World Tobacco Index (WTI), published by the Cartophilic Society of Great Britain (CSGB), lists all known tobacco issues from around the world and is still being updated today on reports of new finds. Using a similar alphanumeric system, it assigns a code based on the name of manufacturer, rather than the century in which the cards were issued. For example, Burdick&#x27;s N2 &#x27;Celebrated American Indian Chiefs&#x27; by Allen &amp; Ginter is listed as A400-030 (a), with the larger N42 series listed as A400-030 (b).

== Sports cigarette cards ==
The following list focuses on the sports-only cards manufactured by tobacco companies:
;Notes:

===Association football===
Ogden&#x27;s Limited of Liverpool produced cigarette cards featuring football from 1894 which were included with their Guinea Gold brand until 1901. They were later included with their Tabs brand from 1901 to 1903.

In 1896 Marcus &amp; Company of Manchester produced the first football set called Footballers &amp; Club Colours. In 1902 W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills produced a set of football-related cards called the Football Series with 66 cards featuring advertising for their Wild Woodbine and Cinderella brands. William Clarke &amp; Sons of Liverpool later issued the same set but with a short biography for the player on each one.

In 1906, Ogden&#x27;s produced a set depicting footballers in their club colours, in one of the first full-colour sets.

Wills issued a 50-card set for the Indian market in 1907 with their Scissors brand, called Football Team Colours. Further sets were issued overseas by Wills in 1910 and 1914.

Wills produced further sets in 1935 and 1939.
===Cricket===

Wills produced a set called &#x27;Cricketers&#x27; in 1896 and released others sets in 1901, 1908, 1909, 1910 and 1928.

==Other cigarette cards==
Another notable and sought-after set of cards is the untitled series issued by Taddy and known by collectors as &quot;Clowns and Circus Artistes&quot;. While not the rarest cards in existence (there are a number of series in which only one known example remains), they are still very rare and command high prices whenever they come up for auction. The T206 Ty Cobb is another example of a notably rare cigarette card.

The Mecca cigarette trading card for George Sutton is also notable for it depicts him with hands. Sutton was known as &quot;the handless billiard player&quot; for mastering the game with such a handicap.

Apart from these examples, there are also cigarette cards that do not focus on people, but on cities or flags.
==Legacy==
The largest cigarette card collection on record is that of Edward Wharton-Tigar. His collection, bequeathed to the British Museum following his death in 1995, is recognised by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the largest collection of its kind. His autobiography, &quot;Burning Bright&quot;, details both his obsession with collecting cigarette cards, as well as his business life, which included becoming President of Selection Trust – at the time, one of the largest mining companies in the world – as well as his lifelong passion for cricket, which culminated in his presidency of Kent Cricket Club. When asked what others thought of his collecting he said: &quot;If to collect cigarette cards is a sign of eccentricity, how then will posterity judge one who amassed the biggest collection in the world? Frankly, I care not.&quot;

He was the president of the Cartophilic Society of Great Britain until his death in 1995.

===World record price===
The most valuable cigarette card in the world features Honus Wagner, one of the great names in U.S. baseball at the turn of the 20th century. The T206 Honus Wagner has repeatedly set records at auction, most recently in 2016 when it sold for $3,120,000. Wagner was a dedicated non-smoker and objected when America&#x27;s biggest tobacco corporation planned to picture him on a cigarette card without his permission. Threats of legal action prevented its release, but a few slipped out, and it was one of these that stunned the collecting world when it was auctioned.

<doc id="57596" wikidata="Q223085" url="?curid=57596" title="Football War">
<text>The Football War (), also known as the Soccer War or the 100 Hour War, was a brief military conflict fought between El Salvador and Honduras in 1969. Existing tensions between the two countries coincided with rioting during a 1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier. The war began on 14 July 1969 when the Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The Organization of American States (OAS) negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July, hence its nickname. Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August. 

The war, while brief, had major consequences for both countries and was a major factor in starting the Salvadoran Civil War a decade later.

==Background==
Although the nickname &quot;Football War&quot; implies that the conflict was due to a football match, the causes of the war went much deeper. The roots were issues over land reform in Honduras and immigration and demographic problems in El Salvador. Honduras has more than five times the area of neighboring El Salvador, but in 1969 the population of El Salvador (3.7 million) was 40 percent larger than that of Honduras (2.6 million). At the beginning of the 20th century, Salvadorans had begun migrating to Honduras in large numbers. By 1969, more than 300,000 Salvadorans were living in Honduras, making up more than 10% of Honduras&#x27;s population.

In Honduras, as in much of Central America, a large majority of the land was owned by large landowners or big corporations. The United Fruit Company owned 10% of the land, making it hard for the average landowner to compete. In 1966, United Fruit banded together with many other large companies to create the National Federation of Honduran Farmers and Ranchers (, FENAGH). This group put pressure on the President of Honduras, General Oswaldo López Arellano, to protect the property of wealthy landowners from &quot;campesinos&quot;, many of which were Salvadoran.

In 1962, Honduras successfully enacted a new land reform law. Fully enforced by 1967, this law gave the central government and municipalities much of the land occupied illegally by Salvadoran immigrants and redistributed it to native-born Hondurans. The land was taken from both immigrant farmers and squatters regardless of their claims to ownership or immigration status. This created problems for Salvadorans and Hondurans who were married. Thousands of Salvadoran laborers were expelled from Honduras, including both migrant workers and longer-term settlers. This general rise in tensions ultimately led to a military conflict.

==Buildup==

In June 1969, both countries met in a two-leg 1970 FIFA World Cup qualifier. The first game was held in Tegucigalpa, Honduras&#x27; capital, on 8 June 1969. The Salvadoran team was harassed by Honduran fans at their hotel the night before the match. Honduras won , causing Salvadoran fans to reportedly set fire to the stadium.

The second game was held in San Salvador, El Salvador&#x27;s capital, on 15 June 1969. Salvadoran fans, seeking vengeance, rioted outside the Honduran team&#x27;s hotel, leading to several deaths. At the match&#x27;s start, a dirty rag was flown instead of the Honduran flag. It was won by El Salvador. Anti-Salvadoran riots occurred across Honduras following the loss.

On 26 June 1969, the night before the play-off match in Mexico City, which El Salvador would win after extra time, El Salvador dissolved all diplomatic ties with Honduras, stating that around 12,000 Salvadorans had been forced to flee Honduras in the days following the second match. It further claimed that &quot;the Government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans&quot;.

=== Border skirmishes ===
On 3 July, Salvadoran anti-aircraft fired on a civilian Douglas DC-3 in Honduran airspace, causing the Honduran Air Force (&quot;,&quot; FAH) to scramble two North American T-28 Trojans and forces stationed near the border town of El Poy to briefly clash. The same day, a Piper PA-28 Cherokee, used by the Salvadoran Air Force (, FAS) as a reconnaissance plane, was intercepted, but managed to escape capture. 

At the request of the Honduran foreign minister, the OAS held an emergency meeting the following day, where it was decided that the organization would &quot;postpone any action of its own&quot; and have the neighboring nations of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala mediate the situation. Honduras and El Salvador were also both urged to &quot;avoid any action that might further endanger the situation&quot;. However, the OAS resolution did little to reduce tensions as skirmishes continued. 

On 5 July, El Salvador claimed that two Honduran platoons had crossed the border. On 12 July, Honduras claimed that four Salvadoran soldiers had been killed in an incursion, something which El Salvador dismissed as part of a &quot;continuing campaign of distortion of the truth&quot;. On 13 July, six Honduran civilians were injured during another skirmish at El Poy, in which both sides exchanged mortar fire.
==War==

The war began on 14 July 1969 at around 6 PM, when the FAS attacked Honduran airfields using P-51 Mustangs, as well as C-47 Skytrains and civilian aircraft hastily converted into bombers. They mainly targeted Toncontín International Airport, where the FAH kept half of its aircraft. The Salvadoran Army then launched a two-front invasion of Honduras; one contingent headed to secure the prosperous Sula Valley, while the other marched along the Pan-American Highway toward Tegucigalpa. Troops were supported by M3A1 Stuarts, as well as bulldozers and trucks using improvised vehicle armor. Initial progress was swift, with &quot;La Prensa Gráfica&quot; claiming they advanced in a single day. 

On 15 July, the FAH commenced bombings using their own fleet of World War II-era aircraft, mainly consisting of F4U Corsairs. Sortie targets included the Ilopango International Airport and oil facilities in Acajutla and . El Salvador lost 20% of its fuel reserves in the raids. However, despite the operation&#x27;s success, the FAH went on the defensive for the rest of the war following a second FAS attack on Toncontín.

On 16 July, in the only major battle of the war, Salvadoran troops led by Colonel Mario (“El Diablo”) Velázquez Jandres, reached and surrounded Nueva Ocotepeque, pressing defenses in what TIME described as a &quot;narrow defile&quot;. Following artillery barrages, Honduran forces retreated alongside civilians, leading to the town&#x27;s capture. Both fronts stalled later that day due to an ammunition shortage and increasing Honduran resistance.

One of the last engagements of the war took place on the afternoon of 17 July, a dogfight which involved 4 Corsairs and 2 Mustangs. Captain Guillermo Reynaldo Cortez, a Salvadoran, was killed; he was the highest-ranking casualty of the war. The Football War was the last conflict in which piston-engined fighters fought each other.

==Ceasefire==
Soon after the start of the war, the OAS held a special session, organizing a seven nation committee to oversee negotiations and calling for a cease-fire. While Honduran officials were reportedly willing, El Salvador resisted OAS pressure for several days, with one of the biggest sticking points, according to the CIA, being the time window given for troops to be withdrawn. 

A cease-fire was arranged on the night of 18 July, which required Salvadoran troops to withdraw within 96 hours and an end to &quot;inflammatory press, radio, and T.V. campaigns&quot;, among other things. It took effect at midnight.

=== Delayed withdrawal ===
Soon before the initial 96 hour deadline, the Salvadoran government sent a document to the OAS, stating, while it would continue to hold the cease-fire, it would not withdraw troops until a guarantee of safety for Salvadorans still living in Honduras was given, reparations were paid, and anti-Salvadoran rioters were punished. Honduras only fulfilled the first demand, but El Salvador relented after the OAS threatened sanctions, resulting in troops withdrawing on 2 August 1969.

==Consequences==
El Salvador suffered up to 700 casualties throughout the course of the war, including 107 deaths. Three aircraft were also destroyed in Honduran air raids. Official records state Honduras suffered 165 casualties, including 99 deaths, but such numbers have been disputed; Nueva Ocotepeque&#x27;s parish priest reportedly saw 400 dead , while internal CIA documents report up to 1,500. Most historians agree civilians accounted for the majority of the losses.

Some 300,000 Salvadorans had been displaced; many had been forcibly exiled or had fled from war-torn Honduras, only to enter an El Salvador in which the government was not welcoming. Most of these refugees were forced to provide for themselves with very little assistance. Over the next few years, more Salvadorans returned to their native land, where they encountered overpopulation and extreme poverty. The resulting social unrest was one of the causes of the Salvadoran Civil War, which followed approximately a decade later in which 70,000 to 80,000 died and a further 8,000 more disappeared.

Trade between Honduras and El Salvador, which had been heavily disrupted pre-war, was outright stopped following it. Honduras would go on to leave and thereby further weaken the already ailing Central American Common Market, a regional integration project that had been set up by the United States largely as a means of counteracting the effects of the Cuban Revolution.

==Aftermath==
Although it had initiated the war, El Salvador played in the World Cup; it was eliminated after losing its first three matches against the USSR, Mexico, and Belgium.

Eleven years after the conflict the two nations signed a peace treaty in Lima, Peru on 30 October 1980 and agreed to resolve the border dispute over the Gulf of Fonseca and five sections of land boundary through the International Court of Justice (ICJ). In 1992, the Court awarded most of the disputed territory to Honduras, and in 1998, Honduras and El Salvador signed a border demarcation treaty to implement the terms of the ICJ decree. The total disputed land area given to Honduras after the court&#x27;s ruling was around . In the Gulf of Fonseca the court found that Honduras held sovereignty over the island of El Tigre, and El Salvador over the islands of Meanguera and Meanguerita.

The dispute continued despite the ICJ ruling. At a meeting in March 2012 President Porfirio Lobo of Honduras, President Otto Pérez of Guatemala, and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua all agreed that the Gulf of Fonseca would be designated as a peace zone. El Salvador was not at the meeting. However, in December 2012, El Salvador agreed to a tripartite commission of government representatives from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua that was to take care of territorial disputes through peaceful means and come up with a solution by 1 March 2013. The commission did not meet after December, and in March 2013 stiff letters threatening military action were exchanged between Honduras and El Salvador.

<text>Types of communications in Algeria, including telephones, mass media and the Internet.

In October 2013, the Algeria Regulatory Authority for Post and Telecommunication awarded 3G licences to the three mobile operators in Algeria: Mobilis, Ooredoo Algeria and Djezzy. The mobile operator companies promised their clients better mobile internet service.

==Controversy==
In October 2013, the Algeria Regulatory Authority for Post and Telecommunication awarded 3G licences to the three mobile operators in Algeria: Mobilis, Ooredoo, and Djezzy. The mobile operator companies promised their clients better mobile internet service.

The authority imposed on mobile operators a 3G double numbering license. This double numbering system requires any citizen that wishes to use the 3G service, must hold two separate 2G and 3G mobile numbers. Having two numbers with two different mobile internet access is more expensive and inconvenient.

==&quot;Anonymous involvement&quot;==
&quot; In August 2012 a group in the Anonymous irc channel #OpAlgeria started an operation against the Algeria Regulatory Authority for Post and Telecommunication. This operation was started because the authority made a decision to require authorization of its users before allowing them to use any kind of encryption (for example; IpSec). They also will require authorization for any type of virtual private network (VPN) technology (for example; PPTP, L2TP, GRE tunneling, OpenVPN, and most other protocols that allow protection of information).&quot;

<text>As the tenth-largest country in the world, and the largest in Africa and in the Mediterranean region, Algeria has a vast transportation system that includes a large and diverse transportation infrastructure.

== Railways ==

There are a total of of railways: with of that being electrified and of that being double tracked.

SNTF operates the railways, whilst a new, separate organisation, Anesrif, has been created to manage infrastructure investment.

The High Plateau line is a major new project to build an east–west line across the country, parallel to the Rocade Nord.

=== Timeline ===
==== 2009 ====
* A 690-km line from Béchar to Oran is opened on 15 July.
* Planning starts on suburban electrification at 25 kV AC.

==== 2006 ====
* A new railway currently under construction from Tébessa to Aïn M&#x27;Lila. The Algiers bypass line between Djasr Kasentina and Oued Smar is also being upgraded.
* 18 May 2006 SNTF is to spend $US5 billion (about R30bn) in the next five years on improvements. It has awarded a 39-month-duration contract worth €248.3 million to a joint Algerian and Spanish consortium that will double the Annaba–Ramdane Djamal portion of the Algiers–Annaba line and upgrade the track for 1 operation.
* SNTF is to electrify of the route west of Annaba at 25 kV AC, including the branches from Ramdane Djamel to Skikda () and Beni Mansour to Béjaïa (), as well as the line from Khemis Miliana to Oran ().
* 18 May 2006 – By early 2009, it is hoped to open the first section of the new light rail line in Algeria&#x27;s capital city, linking Carl du Ruisseau to Bordj El Kiffan.
* Under construction: there are 3 projects to build tramway networks in 3 major cities: Alger, Oran and Constantine (, planned opening 2010).
* CAF is to supply 17 non-tilting diesel multiple-units based on the Renfe Series 598 tilting trains.

==Metro==

The Algiers Metro is a rapid transit system that first opened in 2011, making Algiers the first city in the Maghreb to possess this type of infrastructure. The system is mostly underground and extends over , serving 19 stations, and has an annual ridership of over 40 million passengers in 2018.

Several expansion projects are underway to ensure more extensive coverage of the capital city, with the network projected to reach a length of and serve 58 stations in the future.

==Tramways==
Algeria possesses one of the highest number of tram systems among developing countries, and by far the highest number in Africa, with 7 operating systems across different major cities. Currently the cities of Algiers, Oran, Constantine, Sétif, Sidi bel Abbes, Mostaganem and Ouargla have a tram line in operation. The government, wanting to diversify the country&#x27;s future in rail transport, has assigned the Entreprise Métro d&#x27;Alger to the projects.

* Algiers tramway (2011)
* Oran Tramway (2013) 18.7 kilometres (11.6 mi) of route and 32 stops.
* Constantine tramway (2013) of route and 21 stops. 
*Sidi Bel Abbès tramway (June 2017) 13.74 kilometres (8.54 mi) of route and 22 stops.
* Ouargala tramway (March 2018) of route and 16 stops.
* Sétif tramway (May 2018) 22.4 kilometres (13.9 mi) of route and 26 stops.
* Mostaganem Tramway (2022) kilometers of route and 24 stops.

== Highways ==


Due to extensive investment the motorway network in Algeria is expanding, along with other kinds of infrastructure. The country plans to link all of its major ports and cities with its highway network, as well as linking the country to all of its neighbors, with the aim of boosting economic activity and trade.

Currently Algeria has over of paved roads including of expressways (six-lane highways), as well as of unpaved roads for a total road system of about .

===Regional highways===
Algeria has two major roads in the Trans-African Highway network, including the Trans-Sahara Highway, which traverses the country from north to south, and eventually continues into Niger and Nigeria, linking Algiers to Lagos, Nigeria. The country has also constructed the East–west highway, which crosses the entirety of the country&#x27;s north along the east–west axis, and runs from its border with Tunisia to that with Morocco, connecting most major Algerian cities in the process.

===Motorways===
*East-West Highway. This is the most important road infrastructure in the country, it is a six-lane expressway that extends all the way from Aïn El Assel, on the border with Tunisia to Maghnia, on the border with Morocco, over the length of 1,216 km. The highway links several major cities of the country along its way, namely Constantine, Sétif, Algiers, Blida, Chlef, Sidi Bel Abbès and Tlemcen, with additional secondary expressways constructed to link to other major cities, such as Oran, Béjaïa, Tizi Ouzou, Jijel, Skikda, Mostaghanem and Batna. 
*Highway of the Hauts Plateaux is a planned highway of 1020 km that runs in parallel to the East–West Highway through the steppe-like region of the Hautes Plaines. The highway extends from the province of Tlemcen on the border with Morocco, through Saïda, Tiaret, Medea, M&#x27;sila, Batna, Oum El Bouaghi, Khenchela and finally ending at Tébessa on the border with Tunisia. Construction has begun on some sections of the highway.
*National Highway 4. Extends from Oran to Boufarik, total length: 384 km. It is a motorway extending from Oran to Zaghloul (Zahana), length: 35 km.
*National Highway 5. It is a motorway on its extent from Dar El Beïda to Ammal. Length: 82 km.
*National Highway 11. It is a motorway running from Alger to Cherchell. Length: 65 km.
*National Highway 12. It is a motorway running from Si Mustapha to Tizi Ouzou. Length: 57 km.

==Cable transport==
Due to its mountainous geography, Algeria has taken a particular interest in cable-based transportation, namely gondola lifts and aerial tramways, which serve as both an ecological and touristic means of transport. Currently there are eight such systems in operation across the country, in Algiers, Oran, Tlemcen, Tizi Ouzou, Chréa, Constantine, Annaba and Skikda.

Over the coming years, Algeria will launch a program of new projects for the modernization and maintenance of all the country&#x27;s cable cars. These works aim to reinforce the country&#x27;s public cable transport.

== Pipelines ==

As of 2013 Algeria had an extensive network of pipelines, with 7,036 kilometers of oil pipelines, 16,415 kilometers of natural gas pipelines, 3,447 kilometers of liquid petroleum gas pipelines, 2,600 kilometers of condensate pipelines and 144 kilometers of refined products pipelines.

The country has 3 export pipelines, two running to Spain (Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline and Medgaz), and one running to Italy (Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline), with an additional pipeline (GALSI) planned between Annaba and Sardinia. The pipeline networks will be extended to France and Germany.

== Ports and harbors ==

=== Mediterranean Sea ===
* Algiers, Annaba, Arzew, Béjaïa, Béni Saf, Dellys, Djendjen, Ghazaouet, Jijel, Mostaganem, Oran, Skikda, and Ténès

== Merchant marine ==

<text>The People&#x27;s National Army (PNA) () is the military of the Algerian republic. It is the direct successor of the National Liberation Army (ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front, which fought French colonial rule during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–1962). It ranks as the 26th most powerful military in the world according to Global Firepower Index, and ranks 22nd in defense spending globally. and covers an expansive military arsenal.

The People&#x27;s National Army include the Algerian Land Forces, the Algerian Air Force, the Navy, and the Algerian Air Defence Force. The antecedents of the army were the conventional military units formed in neighbouring Morocco and Tunisia during the war of independence from France.

==History==
=== Role in politics ===
The Algerian military élite has played a dominating role in Algerian politics ever since independence in 1962, when the army emerged as the only effective powerbroker in a shattered political landscape dominated by weak and competing political factions. At the end of the war of independence, a split developed between the National Liberation Army and the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (GPRA). The GPRA was set up in 1958 to represent the National Liberation Front abroad, mobilise the funds needed to organise the underground movement and support the refugees who had fled to Morocco and Tunisia. But it was the general staff of the ALN that was actually in charge of the revolution. When the war ended, it &quot;dismissed&quot; the GPRA and took over the running of the new state.

After independence in 1962, the Army, led by Houari Boumediène, backed Ahmed Ben Bella to become president. Recognizing the role that the military played in bringing him to power, Ben Bella appointed senior officers as ministers and other important positions within the new state, including naming Boumediène as the defence minister.

Just three years later, Boumediène deposed Ben Bella in a coup, which also saw the former take power and the National Assembly replaced by the Revolutionary Council to oversee the development of state structures. The Council was set up by 26 military officers, including Chadli Bendjedid and Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and it gradually entrenched the military establishment as the founders and the backbone of the Algerian regime. Despite the influence of the army that time was limited due to state and army leadership were joined under Boumediène&#x27;s highly authoritarian presidency, after his death in 1978, the role of the military in politics started to grow from the late 1970s. The Ministry of Defence took over administrative control of the government after Boumediène fell ill. After Boumediène&#x27;s death in 1978,
the military ensured the continuation of its influence in politics by choosing Colonel Chadli Benjedid to succeed as the President, as he increasingly relied on the a small number of military advisers for advice. Despite this, factionalization and rivalries within the military and political élites remains a major factor in Algerian politics.

After being structured as a politicized &quot;people&#x27;s army&quot; in the Boumédiène era, and retaining its allegiance to the FLN during the one-party state years of Algerian history, the military forces were formally depoliticized in 1988, as a multi-party system was introduced. This, however, did not end military influence over Algerian politics. It was extremely suspicious of Islamist parties, such as the Islamic Salvation Front &quot;(Front Islamique du Salut, FIS)&quot;, and opposed the FIS&#x27;s legal recognition in 1989. Since most of the officers were trained overseas in states practicing secular laws, such as France and the Soviet Union, they believe Islamism was a threat to state foundations and a threat to the military&#x27;s interests. This was reflected in decisions by army chiefs to ban the hijab and its reluctance to support Iraq during its invasion of Kuwait.

In 1991, fearing the installation of Sharia Law, which would result in Algeria becoming an Islamic state, the Algerian Army cancelled free elections that were likely to bring an Islamist party, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) (&quot;Front Islamique du Salut&quot;) to power. They also launched a coup d&#x27;etat in January 1991 and forced Bendjedid to resign the presidency. For many officers, the election of an Islamist Algerian government would be a disaster as they believed it would be catastrophic for the economy through capital flight and foreign petrol companies cancelling their agreements to extract oil and gas in Algeria. Politically, the military believed the election of the FIS could bring instability to the country, as there were indications that the FIS&#x27;s opponents are preparing to start armed conflicts against any future Islamist governments. Despite Benjedid assured the officers that he could keep the FIS in check with his constitutional and institutional powers, the military were still suspicious, as they doubted Benjedid&#x27;s ability to exercise such powers and feared he might compromise with the FIS to maintain his position, including sacking senior personnel.
The coup and the cancellation of elections triggered the Algerian Civil War in December 1991, a conflict which is believed to have claimed 100-350,000 lives during the 1990s. During the war, both the armed forces and Islamist insurgents have been severely criticized by outside observers for their conduct of the war on humanitarian and human rights grounds. The state and army Islamist resistance in the late 1990s, but local and sporadic fighting persists in 2009, along with occasional bomb attacks against government targets in major cities. The most active insurgent group is al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, formerly known as GSPC. Since major fighting subsided in about 1997, the army has been engaged in refitting itself for the tasks of a conventional army, after more than a decade of anti-guerrilla action.

Over Boutiflika&#x27;s 20-year-presidency, the military&#x27;s influence over politics decreased, as commanders who once held strong political power started to retire, and Boutiflika himself secured more mandate from the people, as his foreign policies rejuvenated Algeria&#x27;s international status and domestic policies were successful in achieving reconciliation between different sides of the civil war and achieving peace.

However, the military still has a role in Algerian politics. This was displayed during the Algerian protests that forced Bouteflika to resign from office in 2019, after losing support of the military, which Chief of Staff of the military, General Ahmed Gaid Salah, demanded that he be declared unfit for office and be removed immediately.

===Border disputes===
The major part of Algeria&#x27;s armed forces are directed towards the country&#x27;s western border with Morocco and Western Sahara. Algeria supported the guerrilla Western Sahara War (1975–1991) against Moroccan control of Western Sahara by the Polisario Front, a national liberation movement of Sahrawi Bedouin exiled in Algeria&#x27;s Tindouf Province. Algeria has had longstanding border disagreements with Morocco, due to the non-recognition of the colonial borders by the Moroccan regime. Although now basically resolved, these continue to linger as a factor in the consistently troubled but generally non-violent relations between the two neighboring states. The Algeria-Morocco border has been closed since 1994. Both countries&#x27; armed forces have engaged in costly equipment upgrades in recent years, clearly viewing each other as the principal threat to their sovereignty, and equally reluctant to let the other nation gain the upper hand militarily.

By contrast, Algeria&#x27;s post-independence border disagreements with Tunisia and Libya, which were at times a cause for poor relations, both appear to have been peacefully resolved (to its advantage). The Algerian army has also, especially in later years, been very active along the Algeria-Mali border, where various insurgent movements are based. Algeria has fought only two brief wars and battles after independence (the Sand War, a border conflict with Morocco in 1963 and the First battle of Amgala in 1976), but the country is also, like most Arab nations, formally at war with Israel since 1948.

In 1984, after promoting eight colonels to become the first generals in independent Algeria, Chadli Benjedid announced the establishment of an ANP general staff. Previously, the armed forces had relied on the secretary general of the Ministry of National Defence to coordinate staff activities. The previous secretary general of the ministry, Major General Moustafa Benloucif, was named the first chief of staff. Benloucif had risen quickly in the ANP and was also an alternate member of the FLN Political Bureau. However, he was dismissed in 1986 without explanation; in 1992 the regime announced that Benloucif would be tried for corruption and the embezzlement of US$11 million, which had been transferred to European accounts.

Bouteflika sought to reassert the power of the presidency over the largely autonomous armed forces. As Minister of Defence, he nominated new commanders for military regions in August 2004. He also issued a presidential decree creating the position of General Secretary within the Ministry of Defence. Nevertheless, current and retired officers—&quot;le pouvoir&quot;—remain important decision-makers. In order to encourage Algerian military reforms, the U.S. decided to allow Algeria to receive International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds.

Algeria has the largest defence budget in Africa. Historically, Algeria bought weapons and military equipment from the Soviet Union. United Press International reported in March 2013 that Algeria was undergoing a process of military modernization, which includes the introduction of new, more modern warships, aircraft, and tanks.

On 19 January 2013, Algerian troops killed 32 militant hostage-takers and freed more than 650 hostages held at the Tigantourine gas facility, situated near in Amenas in the Illizi Province. Nearly 48 hostages are confirmed to be dead. The kidnappers said the assault on the gas plant was launched in retaliation for French intervention against Islamist groups in neighboring Mali.

== Composition ==


The army is under the control of the president, who also is the minister of National Defence. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency estimated that military expenditures accounted for some 6% of GDP in 2019.

Before 1984, the armed forces had relied on the secretary general of the Ministry of National Defence to coordinate staff activities. That year, Chadli Bendjedid announced the establishment of an ANP general staff. The general staff had responsibility for operational planning for the integrated armed forces, budgeting, information and communications, logistics and administrative support, mobilization, and recruiting. It was not, however, part of the regular chain of command. In practice, the armed forces chief of staff dealt directly with the chiefs of the service branches and with the commanders of the six military regions. Along with the minister of defence (Nezzar in 1993), Helen Chapin Metz wrote in 1993 that the senior hierarchy of the armed forces included the Chief of Staff of the People&#x27;s National Army, Abdelmalek Guénaizia; the commander of the National Gendarmerie, Abbas Ghezaiel; the chief of the DRS, Mohamed Médiène; and the inspector general of the land forces, Tayeb Derradji.

In October 2013 &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; predicted the recreation of an inspectorate of the armed forces, possibly to be headed by General Ben Ali Ben Ali.

The armed forces comprise:
* Algerian Land Forces (270,000 in 2012), operating T-90S tanks, and other vehicles, as well as Iskander-E ballistic missiles, BMPT Terminator and BMPT-62. Their standard-issue rifle is a Chinese variant of the AK-47/AKM.
* Algerian National Navy (MRA) (est. 30,000 in 2012), operating MEKO A200 frigates, Kilo-class submarines, heavy C-28A stealth corvettes and other vessels.
* Algerian Air Force (AAF) (14,000 in 2012, this figure included AD numbers), operating Su-30MKAs, MiG-25, MiG-29 and other aircraft.
* Territorial Air Defence Forces (&quot;Defense aerienne du territoire&quot;) (8,000 in 2012) (3 brigades, 3 regiments with SA-2/3/6/20, 725 AA guns) 8 system S-300 (missile), 4 system S-400 (missile), 24 batteries tor M2, 108 Pantsir-S1/SM and 48 Buk M2. 40 SA-6 were reported in service in 2012.

The army was in the process of being reorganized into four divisions in 1993, and also has numerous independent brigades and battalions. There are seven military regions, the seventh being added in 2013. The 6th Military Region was created in 1975 to cover the south, and the 7th Military Region in 2013. Regular military forces are composed of conscripts; all Algerian men are required to do a year of military service.

Military intelligence, recognized to have played a major political role, was long called &quot;Sécurité militaire&quot; (Military Security, SM) but reorganized in the late 1980s and early 1990s into &quot;Département du Renseignement et de la Sécurité&quot; (Department of Intelligence and Security, DRS). The DRS and its counter-espionage branch, DCE, was a leading role in the fight against the Islamist insurgency of the 1990s through a number of its own special forces units, as well as by establishing joint task force commands which assumed control over specialized military and police units.

Since 2016 the DRS has been dissolved and the new Algerian intelligence service is the &quot;Direction des services de sécurités&quot; (DSS).

Military forces are supplemented by a 150,000-member National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie Nationale), a paramilitary body, which is used mainly as a police force in rural areas. The 200,000-member &quot;Sûreté nationale&quot; or metropolitan police force is under the Ministry of the Interior.

Algeria is one of four Saharan states which will create a Joint Military Staff Committee, to be based at Tamanrasset in southern Algeria. Algeria, Mauritania, Niger, and Mali will take part. Mortimer wrote that &#x27;..In March 2010, the Centre d&#x27;Etat-Major commun Opérationel Conjoint (CEMOC) was established&#x27;. A later report said the committee had a secretariat with four staff sections: operations, intelligence, logistics, and communications.

== Equipment ==

Algeria&#x27;s primary military suppliers have been the former Soviet Union, which sold various types of sophisticated equipment under military trade agreements, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Since independence in the 1960s, no foreign bases are known to have been allowed in Algeria, although in the 1970s and 1980s, large numbers of Soviet military advisers were stationed in the country. Since 2001, security cooperation with the United States has increased, and US forces have taken part in training missions in the country&#x27;s Saharan south.

Another weapons supplier of Algeria is France. France and Algeria have had a significant connection since the French Algeria colonial era, as France supplies weapons and armor to Algerian forces. As of October 2009, it was reported that Algeria canceled a weapons deal with France over the presence of Israeli parts.

Four or eight battalions of Russian S-300PMU2 long-range anti-aircraft missiles were ordered in 2006. In 2006, multibillion-dollar purchases of Russian military equipment were made in order to upgrade the country&#x27;s conventional arsenal. This included a deal by the Algerian Air Force to buy 28 Su-30MKA and 36 MiG-29SMT for up to $3.5 billion. However, those MiG-29s were returned to Russia in February 2008 because of poor airframe quality, after technical evaluations in Algeria. In May 2008 the two governments agreed on a new deal to replace those 36 MiG-29SMT by a new batch of 16 Su-30MKA which meet all requirements of Algerian Air Force.

Algeria also has a small domestic military industry of its own. The army produces AK-47 and AKM-47 assault rifles, licensed by Russia and China, as well as rocket-type RPGs in the Construction Company Mechanical Khenchela (ECMK).

Moreover, the ECMK also builds under license the UAE Caracal pistol. The logistics base station produces various types of AICV (Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle) for the transport of troops and light armored vehicles. The air force produces two types of light aircraft for the basic training and has produced its own reconnaissance drone since December 2010. The Russian company, Rosoboronexport, has expressed a request for financial assistance to several countries including Algeria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE to participate in the project for the production of the T-50 (PAK-FA) 5th generation fighter aircraft.

=== Military industry===

In 2019, the Algerian Military laid the foundation for kickstarting its military defense industry in order to design, build and manufacture “complex weapons” systems. Starting in 2021 began producing the &quot;BMPT-62&quot; nicknamed &quot;Mini-Terminator&quot;. the Algerian T-62 fleet underwent a unique homemade upgrade under the ordenance of Algeria&#x27;s Central Logistics Base (BCL), turning the vehicle from an MBT into a fire-support vehicle by replacing the old turret with a Berezhok combat turret containing a PKT, a 30 mm autocannon, four Kornet ATGMs and a teleoperated AGS-30 grenade launcher.

Algeria also has a military industrial company called the Military Industry of Central Direction, which produces military arms, vehicles, weapons, ships, jets, helicopters, tanks, and other equipment. It was founded in 1998.

The military industry of Algeria dates back to 1980, when Algeria needed to diversify and sought to have its own national equipment so as to be less reliant on weapons imported from the Soviet Union and France. The development of the military industry in Algeria in the 1980s played a crucial role when the Algerian Civil War occurred a decade later. The indigenously manufactured weapons helped the Algerian military in combating the Islamists around the country, contributing to the government&#x27;s victory in 2002.

Algeria exports its indigenously manufactured weapons to Tunisia, Mali, Niger, Libya, Mauritania and several other African as well as Arab states in the Middle East.

Since 2017 the &quot;Société Algérienne de Fabrication de Véhicules de Marque Mercedes Benz&quot; (SAFAV-MB) supplied the Algerian armed and security forces with several types of Mercedes-Benz vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz Unimog, Zetros, Sprinter, Actros, G-class...

Additionally, all of these vehicles are made in Algeria with the vehicles of the &quot;Société Nationale des Véhicules Industrielles&quot; (SNVI).

<text>El Alamein (, ) is a town in the northern Matrouh Governorate of Egypt. Located on the Mediterranean Sea, it lies west of Alexandria and northwest of Cairo. The town is located on the site of the ancient city Antiphrai which was built by the Romans.().

===Military cemeteries===

====Germany====
There are Italian and German military cemeteries on Tel el-Eisa Hill outside the town. The German cemetery is an ossuary, built in the style of a medieval fortress.

====Italy====
The Italian cemetery is a mausoleum containing 5,200 tombs. 

====Greek====
There is a Greek cemetery at El Alamein.

====Commonwealth of Nations====
There is a Commonwealth war cemetery, built and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, with graves of soldiers from various countries who fought on the Allied side. Buried here are 6,425 identified Commonwealth service personnel, 815 unidentified ones, and 102 of other nationalities. These include four Victoria Cross recipients:
*Private Percy Gratwick, Second Australian Imperial Force
*Private Arthur Stan Gurney, Second Australian Imperial Force
*Sergeant William Bill Kibby, Second Australian Imperial Force
*Private Adam Wakenshaw, Durham Light Infantry

Others buried here include:
*Squadron Leader George Barclay, Royal Air Force Battle of Britain fighter pilot
*Major Henry Rew, Royal Tank Regiment

This has monuments commemorating Greek, New Zealand, Australian, South African, Indian and Canadian forces. The cemetery entrance is through the Alamein Memorial and there is also a separate Alamein Cremation Memorial to 603 Commonwealth service personnel who died in Egypt and Libya and were cremated in line with their religion.

The names of 213 Canadian airmen appear on the Alamein Memorial in Egypt.

The cemetery was designed by Hubert Worthington.

===Beaches===
Many Egyptians, particularly the upper and middle class travel to El Alamein during summer to flee the summer heat in other cities and towns.

==Climate==
El Alamein has a hot desert climate, Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;, common with most of the Middle East and North Africa. However, like the rest of the northern coast of Egypt, its climate is slightly less hot, compared to the rest of Egypt, because of the prevailing Mediterranean Sea winds.

==World War II==

Two important World War II battles were fought in the area:

*At the First Battle of El Alamein (1–27 July 1942), the advance of Axis troops on Alexandria was blunted by the Allies, stopping the Italian and German forces that were trying to outflank the Allies&#x27; position.
*At the Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October – 4 November 1942), Allied forces broke the Axis line and forced them all the way back to Tunisia. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister at the time, said of this victory: &quot;Now this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.&quot; After the war, he wrote: &quot;Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein, we never had a defeat.&quot;

<text>Max Reinhardt (; born Maximilian Goldmann; 9 September 1873 – 30 October 1943) was an Austrian-born theatre and film director, intendant, and theatrical producer. With his radically innovative and avant-garde stage productions, Reinhardt is regarded as one of the most prominent stage directors of the early 20th century.

For example, Reinhardt&#x27;s 1917 stage premiere of Reinhard Sorge&#x27;s Kleist Prize-winning stage play &quot;Der Bettler&quot; almost single-handedly gave birth to Expressionism in the theatre and ultimately in motion pictures as well. In 1920, Reinhardt established the Salzburg Festival by directing an open air production of Hugo von Hofmannsthal&#x27;s acclaimed adaptation of the &quot;Everyman&quot; Medieval mystery play in the square before the Cathedral with the Alps as a background. This remains an annual custom at the Salzburg Festival to this day.

Toby Cole and Helen Krich Chinoy have dubbed Reinhardt, &quot;one of the most picturesque actor-directors of modern times&quot;, and write that his eventual arrival in the United States as a refugee from the imminent Nazi takeover of Austria followed a long and distinguished career, &quot;inspired by the example of social participation in the ancient Greek and Medieval theatres&quot;, of seeking, &quot;to bridge the separation between actors and audiences&quot;.

In 1935, Reinhardt directed his first and only motion picture in the United States through Warner Brothers, the Expressionist film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, starring Mickey Rooney, Olivia De Havilland, and James Cagney. The film was banned by the Ministry of Propaganda in an infamous example of censorship in Nazi Germany. This was due not only to Joseph Goebbels&#x27; belief that Expressionism was degenerate art, but even more so due to the Jewish ancestry of director Max Reinhardt, Classical music composer Felix Mendelssohn, and soundtrack arranger Erich Wolfgang Korngold; whose work was already banned by Goebbels as allegedly degenerate music.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbiddenmusic/reinhardt-circus&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt also founded the highly influential drama schools Hochschule für Schauspielkunst &quot;Ernst Busch&quot; in Berlin, Max Reinhardt Seminar, the Max Reinhardt Workshop (Sunset Boulevard), and the Max Reinhardt Junior Workshop. Even though Reinhardt did not live long enough to witness the end of Nazism in 1945, his formerly expropriated estate at Schloss Leopoldskron near Salzburg was restored to his widow and his legacy continues to be celebrated and honoured in the modern Germanosphere for his many radically innovative contributions to the performing arts.

==Early life==

Reinhardt was born Maximilian Goldmann in the spa town of Baden bei Wien, the son of Rachel Lea Rosi &quot;Rosa&quot; Goldmann and her husband Wilhelm Goldmann, a merchant from Stupava, Slovakia. Having finished school, he began an apprenticeship at a bank, but already took acting lessons.

==Career==
In 1890, he gave his debut on a private stage in Vienna with the stage name &quot;Max Reinhardt&quot; (possibly after the protagonist Reinhard Werner in Theodor Storm&#x27;s novella &quot;Immensee&quot;). In 1893 he performed at the re-opened Salzburg City Theatre. One year later, Reinhardt relocated to Germany, joining the Deutsches Theater ensemble under director Otto Brahm in Berlin.

Reinhardt was one of the contributors of the Swedish avant-garde theatre magazine &quot;Thalia&quot; between 1910 and 1913. In 1918 Reinhardt purchased Schloss Leopoldskron castle in Salzburg.

In October 1922 Reinhardt was in the audience when &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; was staged by the Vilna Troupe at the Roland Theater in Vienna. Reinhardt rushed backstage and congratulated the actors. At the time he was already recognized in Austria as distinguished theater director. A couple of months before his endorsement for &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, Reinhardt had again successfully staged &quot;Jedermann (Everyman)&quot; for the Salzburg Festival.

===Exile===

Reinhardt fled due to the Nazis&#x27; increasing anti-Semitic aggressions. The castle was seized following Germany&#x27;s Anschluss annexation of Austria in 1938. After the war, the castle was restored to Reinhardt&#x27;s heirs, and subsequently the home and grounds became famous as the filming site for the early scenes of the Von Trapp family gardens in the movie &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

===Reinhardt theatres===
In 1901, Reinhardt together with Friedrich Kayßler and several other theatre colleagues founded the &quot;Schall und Rauch&quot; (Sound and Smoke) Kabarett stage in Berlin. Re-opened as &quot;Kleines Theater&quot; (Little Theatre) it was the first of numerous stages where Reinhardt worked as a director until the beginning of Nazi rule in 1933. From 1903 to 1905, he managed the Neues Theater (present-day Theater am Schiffbauerdamm) and in 1906 acquired the Deutsches&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishvirtuallibrary/reinhardt-max&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Theater in Berlin. In 1911, he premiered with Karl Vollmöller&#x27;s &quot;The Miracle&quot; in Olympia, London, gaining an international reputation.

In 1910, Siegfried Jacobsohn wrote his book entitled &quot;Max Reinhardt&quot;. In 1914, he was persuaded to sign the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, defending the German invasion of Belgium. He was signatory 66; he later expressed regret at signing.

From 1915 to 1918, Reinhardt also worked as director of the Volksbühne theatre.

On 23 December 1917, Reinhardt presided over the world premiere of Reinhard Sorge&#x27;s Kleist Prize-winning stage play &quot;Der Bettler&quot;, which had long been, &quot;a &quot;succès de scandale&quot;, an innovation, changing the course of theatrical history with its revolutionary staging techniques&quot;.

According to Michael Paterson, &quot;The genius of the 20-year old Sorge already showed the possibilities of abstract staging, and Reinhardt in 1917, simply by following Sorge&#x27;s stage directions, was to become the first director to present a play in wholly Expressionist style.&quot;

According to Michael Paterson, &quot;The play opens with an ingenious inversion: the Poet and Friend converse in front of a closed curtain, behind which voices can be heard. It appears that we, the audience, are backstage and the voices are those of the imagined audience out front. It is a simple, but disorienting trick of stagecraft, whose imaginative spatial reversal is self-consciously theatrical. So the audience is alerted to the fact that they are about to see a play and not a &#x27;slice of life&#x27;.&quot;

According to Walter H. Sokel, &quot;The lighting apparatus behaves like the mind. It drowns in darkness what it wishes to forget and bathes in light what it wishes to recall. Thus the entire stage becomes a universe of [the] mind, and the individual scenes are not replicas of three-dimensional physical reality, but visualizes stages of thought.&quot;

Reinhardt&#x27;s production of the play, which he had meticulously planned ever since he had purchased the rights from Sorge in 1913, proved enormously popular and productions immediately began to be staged in other German cities, such as Cologne. After the 1918 Armistice, newspapers in the German language in the United States also published articles highly praising Reinhardt&#x27;s production of the play, which singlehandedly gave birth to Expressionism in the theatre.

After the November Revolution of 1918, Reinhardt re-opened the Großes Schauspielhaus (after World War II renamed into Friedrichstadtpalast) in 1919, following its expressionist conversion by Hans Poelzig. By 1930, he ran eleven stages in Berlin and, in addition, managed the Theater in der Josefstadt in Vienna from 1924 to 1933.

In 1920, Reinhardt established the Salzburg Festival with Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal, always directing the annual production of Hoffmansthal&#x27;s acclaimed adaptation of the Medieval Dutch morality play &quot;Everyman&quot;, in which the Christian God sends Death to summon an archetype of the Human Race to Judgment Day. In the United States, he successfully directed &quot;The Miracle&quot; in 1924, and a popular stage version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 1927.

From the 1910s to the early 1930s, one of Reinhardt&#x27;s most frequent collaborators was the Swedish-born American composer and conductor , whom he employed as the music department head of his theaters; during international trips, Nilson would also serve as an advance man for Reinhardt, traveling ahead to the next performance location to audition singers and actors. Reinhardt, moreover, often would utilize existing music by famous composers (for example, Mozart and Mendelssohn) for his productions, which Nilson would arrange to meet Reinhardt&#x27;s needs. Nilson also composed original music, such as the incidental music for Hofmannsthal&#x27;s &quot;Jedermann&quot;.

Reinhardt followed that success by directing a film version of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 1935 using a mostly different cast, that included James Cagney, Mickey Rooney, Joe E. Brown and Olivia de Havilland, amongst others. Rooney and de Havilland had also appeared in Reinhardt&#x27;s 1934 stage production, which was staged at the Hollywood Bowl.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/midsummer-hollywood-bowl&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis banned the film because of the Jewish ancestry of both Reinhardt and Felix Mendelssohn, whose music (arranged by Erich Wolfgang Korngold) was used throughout the film.

After the Anschluss of Austria to Nazi-governed Germany in 1938, he emigrated first to Britain, then to the United States. In 1940, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuenste-im-exil/reinhardt-max&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, he was married to his second wife, actress Helene Thimig, daughter of actor Hugo Thimig and sister of actors Hans and Hermann Thimig.

By employing powerful staging techniques, and integrating stage design, language, music and choreography, Reinhardt introduced new dimensions into German theatre. The Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna, which is arguably the most important German-language acting school, was installed implementing his ideas.

===Max Reinhardt and film===

Reinhardt took a greater interest in film than most of his contemporaries in the theater world. He made films as a director and from time to time also as a producer. His first staging was the film &quot;Sumurûn&quot; in 1910. After that, Reinhardt founded his own film company. He sold the film rights for the film adaptation of the play &quot;Das Mirakel&quot; (&quot;The Miracle&quot;) to Joseph Menchen, whose full-colour 1912 film of &quot;The Miracle&quot; gained world-wide success. Controversies around the staging of &quot;Das Mirakel&quot;, which was shown in the Vienna Rotunde in 1912, led to Reinhardt&#x27;s retreat from the project. The author of the play, Reinhardt&#x27;s friend and confidant Karl Gustav Vollmoeller, had French director Michel Carré finish the shooting. 

Reinhardt made two films, &quot;Die Insel der Seligen&quot; (&quot;Isle of the Blessed&quot;) and &quot;Eine venezianische Nacht&quot; (&quot;Venetian Nights&quot;), under a four-picture contract for the German film producer Paul Davidson. Released in 1913 and 1914, respectively, both films received negative reviews from the press and public. The other two films called for in the contract were never made.

Both films demanded much of cameraman Karl Freund because of Reinhardt&#x27;s special shooting needs, such as filming a lagoon in moonlight. &quot;Isle of the Blessed&quot; attracted attention due to its erotic nature. Its ancient mythical setting included sea gods, nymphs, and fauns, and the actors appeared naked. However, the film also fit in with the strict customs of the late German and Austrian empires. The actors had to live up to the demands of double roles. Wilhelm Diegelmann and Willy Prager played the bourgeois fathers as well as the sea gods, a bachelor and a faun, Leopoldine Konstantin the Circe. The shooting for &quot;Eine venezianische Nacht&quot; by Karl Gustav Vollmoeller took place in Venice. Maria Carmi played the bride, Alfred Abel the young stranger, and Ernst Matray Anselmus and Pipistrello. The shooting was disturbed by a fanatic who incited the attendant Venetians against the German-speaking staff.

In 1935, Reinhardt directed his first film in the US, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. He founded the drama schools Hochschule für Schauspielkunst &quot;Ernst Busch&quot; in Berlin, Max Reinhardt Seminar, the Max Reinhardt Workshop (Sunset Boulevard), and the Max Reinhardt Junior Workshop.

Joan Barry, and Nanette Fabray (&quot;Reinhardt School of the Theatre in Hollywood&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;mahlerfoundation/max-reinhardt&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt won the school, &quot;Ben Bard Drama&quot; (a playhouse on Wilshire Boulevard), from Ben Bard in a poker game. Reinhardt opened the Reinhardt School of the Theatre in Hollywood, on Sunset Boulevard. Several notable stars of the day received classical theater training, among them actress Nanette Fabray. Many alumni of these schools made their careers in film. Edward G. Kuster, for two years, was the personal assistant to Reinhardt, taught classes and directed plays. In 1938, Walden Philip Boyle, later, a founding faculty of the Department of Theater Arts at UCLA, worked with the &quot;Max Reinhardt Theatre Academy in Hollywood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;universityofcalifornia/philipwaldenboyle&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Students include Alan Ladd, Jack Carson, Robert Ryan, Gower Champion, Shirley Temple, Angie Dickinson, Frank Bonner, Anthony James, Greg Mullavey, Charlene Tilton, and Cliff Robertson In 1943, Reinhardt departed.&lt;ref name=&quot;toa.edu/history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It later was known as &quot;Geller Theatre Workshop&quot;, &quot;Hollywood School of Acting&quot;, and &quot;Theatre of Arts Hollywood Acting School&quot;.

In 2000, the school, &quot;Theatre of Arts&quot;, was associated with Campus Hollywood, which included, Musicians Institute, and Los Angeles College of Music. In 2009, James Warwick was appointed president.

Max Reinhardt Junior Workshop trained Mala Powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;walkoffame/mala-powers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mansfieldnewsjournal.newspapers/294003377/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen/Mala+Powers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Reinhardt died of a stroke in New York City in 1943 and is interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, Westchester County, New York. He was 70 years old. His papers and literary estate are housed at Binghamton University (SUNY), in the Max Reinhardt Archives and Library. His sons by first wife Else Heims (m. 1910–1935), Wolfgang and Gottfried Reinhardt, were well-regarded film producers. One of his grandsons (by adoption), Stephen Reinhardt, was a labor lawyer who served notably on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from his appointment by Jimmy Carter in 1980 until his death in 2018. Another grandson, Michael Reinhardt, is a successful fashion photographer. In 2015 his great-granddaughter Jelena Ulrike Reinhardt was appointed as researcher at the University of Perugia in German literature.

==Tribute==
On 18 November 2015, the Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin inaugurated a memorial at Friedrichstraße 107 dedicated to the theatre&#x27;s founders, Max Reinhardt, Hans Poelzig and Erik Charell.

<doc id="57607" wikidata="Q836661" url="?curid=57607" title="Pachinko">
<text>is a mechanical game originating in Japan that is used as an arcade game, and much more frequently for gambling. Pachinko fills a niche in Japanese gambling comparable to that of the slot machine in the West as a form of low-stakes, low-strategy gambling.

Pachinko parlors are widespread in Japan, and usually also feature a number of slot machines (called &quot;pachislo&quot; or pachislots) so these venues look and operate similarly to casinos. Modern pachinko machines have both mechanical and electrical components.

Gambling for cash is illegal in Japan, but the widespread popularity of low-stakes pachinko in Japanese society has enabled a specific legal loophole allowing it to exist. Pachinko balls won from games cannot be exchanged directly for money in the parlor, nor can they be removed from the premises or exchanged with other parlors. However, they can be legally traded to the parlor for so-called &quot;special prize&quot; tokens (特殊景品 &quot;tokushu keihin&quot;), which can in turn be &quot;sold&quot; for cash to a separate vendor off-premises. These vendors (ostensibly independent from, but often owned by, the parlor owner) then sell the tokens back to the parlor at the same price paid for them—plus a small commission, creating a cash profit—without technically violating the law.

By 1994, the pachinko market in Japan was valued at (nearly ). In 1999, sales and revenue from pachinko parlors contributed 5.6% of Japan&#x27;s GDP, and they employed over 330,000 people, 0.52% of all those employed in Japan. However, the sales amount of these pachinko parlors is calculated based on the total amount that customers rented pachinko balls from pachinko parlors. It is said that on average, about 85% of the money spent by customers in pachinko parlors is returned to the customers, so the sales of pachinko parlors are said to be about 15% of the statistical amount. As of 2015, Japan&#x27;s pachinko market generates more gambling revenue than that of Macau, Las Vegas, and Singapore combined. Pachinko gambling&#x27;s grey market nature and tremendous profit historically resulted in considerable infiltration by yakuza, who used it as a vehicle for money laundering and racketeering. 

Since the 1990s, however, this has been less of an issue due to police crackdowns. There were over 7 million pachinkos around the world in 2018 with more than half of them being in Japan. In recent years, the pachinko market (the total amount of pachinko balls rented by customers from pachinko parlors) and the number of pachinko parlors in Japan have continued to decline. The market size in 2022 was 14.6 trillion yen, less than half of the 35 trillion yen in 2005 when the market was at its peak, and the number of pachinko parlors in 2022 was 7665, less than half of the 18244 in 1997 when the number of parlors was the largest. 

Following a number of years of decline of parlours and machines, the number of pachinko machines in Japan dropped to around 2.5 million by the end of 2019.
== Description ==
A pachinko machine resembles a vertical pinball machine, but is different from Western pinball in several ways. It uses small (11 mm diameter) steel balls, which the owner (usually a &quot;pachinko parlor&quot;, featuring many individual games in rows) rents to the player, while pinball games use a larger, captive ball. 

The player loads one or more balls into the machine, then presses and releases a spring-loaded handle, which is attached to a padded hammer inside the machine, launching the ball(s) into a metal track. The track guides the ball over the top of the playing field; then when it loses momentum, it falls into the playing field. Some pachinko machines have a bumper to bounce the ball as it reaches the top, while others allow it to travel all the way around the field, to fall the second time it reaches the top. 

The playing field is populated by numerous brass pins, several small cups into which the player hopes the ball will fall (each catcher is barely the width of the ball), and a hole at the bottom into which the ball falls if it does not enter a catcher. The ball bounces from pin to pin, both slowing its descent and deflecting it laterally across the field. A ball that enters a catcher triggers a payout, in which a number of balls are dropped into a tray at the front of the machine.

Many games made since the 1960s feature &quot;tulip&quot; catchers, which have small flippers that open to expand the width of the catcher. They are controlled by the machine, and may open and close randomly or in a pattern; expert players try to launch a ball so it reaches the catcher when its flippers are open. 

The game&#x27;s object is to win as many balls as possible, which can be exchanged for prizes. Pachinko machines were originally strictly mechanical, but have since incorporated extensive electronics, becoming similar to video slot machines. Another type of machine often found in pachinko parlors, called a &quot;pachislot&quot;, does not involve steel balls, but are loaded with tokens or coins and trigger reels comparable to those of a traditional slot machine. Online casinos also offer &quot;pachislot&quot; games to tailor their product to the Japanese market.

== History ==
Pachinko machines were first built during the 1920s as a children&#x27;s toy called the , based on and named after the American &quot;Corinthian bagatelle&quot;. Another likely inspiration was the , &#x27;Japanese billiards&#x27;, invented in Western Europe during the 18th century. It emerged as an adult pastime in Nagoya around 1930, and spread from there.

All of Japan&#x27;s pachinko parlors were closed down during World War II but re-emerged in the late 1940s. Pachinko has remained popular since; the first commercial parlor was opened in Nagoya in 1948. As a country influenced by Japan during its occupation, Taiwan has many pachinko establishments. 

An estimated 80 percent of pachinko parlors in Japan are owned by ethnic Koreans. In 2001, British company BS Group bought a stake in Tokyo Plaza, which was running almost 20 parlors in all of Japan, and had also looked into opening parlors in the United Kingdom.

Until the 1980s, pachinko machines were mechanical devices, using bells to indicate different states of the machine. Electricity was used only to flash lights and to indicate problems, such as a machine emptied of its balls. Balls were launched using a flipper; their speed was controlled by pulling the flipper down to different levels. Manufacturers in this period included Nishijin and Sankyo; most of these machines available on online auction sites today date to the 1970s. After that time, pachinko machines incorporated more electronic features, thus requiring electricity for operation.

== Mechanisms ==

To play pachinko, players get a number of metal balls by inserting cash or cards directly into the machine they want to use. They then shoot the balls into the machine. Older pachinko machines use a spring-loaded lever for shooting balls individually; while later ones use a round knob, controlling the strength of a mechanically fired plunger that shoots the balls. The balls fall vertically through an array of pins, levers, cups, traps and obstacles until they enter a payoff target or reach the bottom of the playfield.

The player has a chance to get more balls if a launched ball lands in one of certain places as it falls. Having more balls is considered a benefit because it allows the player to remain in the game longer, and ultimately creates a larger winning chance. 

Newer &quot;pachislot&quot; machines have a digital slot machine display on a large screen, where the objective is to get three numbers or symbols in a row for a jackpot. When fired, the balls drop through an array of pins, similar to a pachinko machine. Some fall into a center gate and activate the slot-machine display. 

Every ball that goes into the center gate results in one spin, but there is a limit on the number of spins at one time because of the possibility of balls passing through the center gate while a spin is still in progress. Each spin pays out a small number of balls, but the objective is to hit the jackpot. The machine&#x27;s programming decides the outcome of each spin.

=== Design ===
Pachinko machines vary in several aspects—including decorative mechanics, sound, gimmicks, modes, and gates. The playing field is usually a wooden board with a transparent acrylic overlay containing artwork. Most modern machines have an LCD screen over the main start pocket. The game is played by keeping the stream of balls to the left of the screen, but many models have their optimized ball stream. Vintage machines vary in pocket location and strategy, with most having a specific center area containing win pockets.

=== Payout mode ===

If the first two numbers, letters, or symbols of the spin match up, the digital program will display many animations before the third reel stops spinning, to give the player an added excitement. This is called a reach (or rīchi) and sometimes longer animations are played called super reaches. Pachinko machines offer different odds in hitting a jackpot; if the player manages to obtain a jackpot, the machine will enter into payout mode.

The payout mode lasts for a number of rounds. During each round, amidst more animations and movies playing on the center screen, a large payout gate opens up at the bottom of the machine layout and the player must try to shoot balls into it. Each ball that successfully enters into this gate results in many balls being dropped into a separate tray at the bottom of the machine, which can then be placed into a ball bucket.

=== Hidden modes, hints, and instant wins ===
To enhance gameplay, modern machines have integrated several aspects not possible in vintage machines. A common one is the ability to switch between different play modes, including rare and hidden modes that can differ significantly from normal play. Two examples can be seen in the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; series of pachinko machines, which include Mission Mode and Berserker Mode, ranging from having little effect on winning to being an almost guaranteed win.

Graphics in videos and light patterns can also give players a general idea of what these winning odds are. For example, a super reach may cause a change in animation, or show an introductory animation or picture. This adds excitement, with some changes having much more significance than others in terms of odds of winning on a given spin. Some machines feature instant wins. There are also second-chance wins, where a spin that appears to have lost, or to have a very low winning chance, gives the player three matching numbers and starts &quot;fever mode&quot;.

=== Post-payout systems ===

After the payout mode has ended, the pachinko machine may do one of two things. Most Pachinko machines employ the (, short for meaning probability change) system, where some percentage of the possible jackpots on the digital slot machine result in the odds of hitting the next jackpot multiplying by a large amount, followed by another spin regardless of the outcome. The probability of a occurring is determined by a random number generator. 

Hence, under this system, it is possible for a player to get a string of consecutive jackpots after the first &quot;hard-earned&quot; one, commonly referred to as &quot;fever mode&quot;. Another type of system is a special time or ST &#x27;. With these machines, every jackpot earned results in a &#x27;, but in order to earn a payout beyond the first jackpot, the player must hit a certain set of odds within a given number of spins.

When a jackpot does not result in a combination, the pachinko machine will enter into (, short for meaning time-reduction) mode, with a much larger number of spins than &#x27;. Under the original payout odds, the center gate widens to make it considerably easier for balls to fall into it; this system is also present in &#x27;. 

To compensate for the increase in the number of spins, the digital slot machine reveals the final outcome of each spin sooner. ST pachinko machines do not offer this mode; after it ends, the machine spins as in &quot;&quot;. Once no more jackpots have been made, the pachinko machine reverts to its original setting.

=== Koatari ===
Starting in 2007, the majority of Japanese pachinko machines started to include (, small jackpot) into their payout systems. is shorter than the normal jackpot and during payout mode the payout gate opens for a short time only, even if no balls go into it. The timing of the opening of the gates is unpredictable, effectively making it a jackpot where the player receives no payout. jackpots can result in a as per normal operation, depending on the payout scheme of the machine in question. The main purpose of is so that pachinko manufacturers can offer payout schemes that &quot;appear&quot; to be largely favorable to customers, without losing any long-term profit.

In addition to being able to offer higher percentages, this made it possible for manufacturers to design battle-type machines. Unlike old-fashioned pachinko machines that offer a full payout or a for any type of jackpot earned, these machines require players to hit a jackpot with a certain probability in order to get a full payout. This is orchestrated by the player entering into &quot;battle&quot;, where the player, in accordance with the item that the machine is based on, must &quot;defeat&quot; a certain enemy or foe in order to earn another &quot;&quot;. If the player loses, it means that a normal has been hit and the machine enters into mode.

Another reason for incorporating every is that they have made it possible for a machine to go into mode without the player&#x27;s knowledge. This is referred to as ( &#x27;hidden&#x27;) because it does not occur in any of the jackpot modes. A player sitting at a used pachinko machine offering the number 1 in &quot;x&quot; chance of hitting a jackpot in normal mode can hit it within &quot;x&quot; spins easily because the previous player did not realize that the machine was in &#x27;. This induces players to keep playing their machines, even though they may still be in normal mode. Japanese pachinko players have not shown significant signs of protest in response to the incorporation of &#x27;; on the contrary, battle-type pachinko machines have become a major part of most parlors.

== Prizes ==

Winnings take the form of additional balls, which players may either use to keep playing or exchange for prizes (). When players wish to exchange their winnings, they must call a parlor staff member by using a call button located at the top of their station. The staff member will then carry the player&#x27;s balls to an automated counter to see how many balls they have.

After recording the number of balls the player won and the number of the machine they used, the staff member will then give the player a voucher or card with the number of balls stored in it. Some modern machines can count the balls automatically, without the need for staff. The player then hands it in at the parlor&#x27;s exchange center to get their prizes. Among the array of prizes available, there will invariably be an item known as the &quot;special prize&quot; ( typically a small silver or gold novelty item encased in plastic) that can be sold for cash at an outside establishment in the vicinity of the parlor.

Special prizes are awarded to the player in amounts corresponding to the number of balls won. For example, one special prize worth ¥1500 outside the parlor might be offered to a customer per 400 balls won, assuming each ball originally cost 4 yen. The vast majority of players opt for the maximum number of special prizes offered for their ball total, selecting other prizes only when they have a remaining total too small to receive a special prize.

Besides the special prizes, prizes may be as simple as chocolate bars, pens or cigarette lighters, or as complicated as electronics, bicycles and other items. Under Japanese law, cash cannot be paid out directly for pachinko balls, but there is usually a small establishment located nearby, separate from the game parlor but sometimes in a separate unit as part of the same building, where players may sell special prizes for cash. This is tolerated by the police because the pachinko parlors that pay out goods and special prizes are nominally independent from the shops that buy back the special prizes. 

Some pachinko parlors may even give out vouchers for groceries at a nearby supermarket. The &quot;yakuza&quot; (organized crime) were formerly often involved in prize exchange, but a great deal of police effort beginning in the 1960s and ramping up in the 1990s has largely done away with their influence. In Tokyo, the special prize exchange is handled exclusively by the company (known as TUC), which sells pachinko and slot parlors gold slivers in standardized plastic cases, which it buys back from winning customers at its &quot;TUC Shop&quot; windows.

The three-shop system is a system employed by pachinko parlors to exchange for keihin (prizes), usually with items such as cigarette lighters or ball-point pens. These items are carried to a nearby shop and exchanged for cash as a way of circumventing gambling laws.

== Recreational pachinko ==

Many arcades in Japan feature pachinko models from different times. They offer more playing time for the same amount of money, and have balls that can be exchanged only for game tokens to play other games in the establishment. As many of these arcades are smoke-free and gambling is removed, they are popular venues for casual players, newcomers, children, and those wanting to play in a more relaxed atmosphere. 

In such arcades, thrifty gamblers may spend a small amount on a newly released pachinko model to get a feel for the machine before going to a real parlor. These machines can also be found in many stores, where they pay out capsules containing a prize coupon or store credit.

== Regulations ==

=== Smoking ===
Smoking is allowed in pachinko parlors, although there are discussions in Japan to extend public smoking bans to them.

=== Crime ===
Gambling is illegal in Japan, but pachinko is regarded as an exception and treated as an amusement activity. Although awarding direct money prizes for it is illegal, parlors may reward players with tokens which can then be sold for cash at nearby exchange centers. With growing public and political pressure in recent years, since passage of Japan&#x27;s blanket anti-gambling law in the 1990s, police are more active in regulating parlors. 

Retired police officers often work in the pachinko industry; critics have pointed out that while this has had a deterrent effect against organized crime, it also means these operators are in a strong position to influence police officers in their favor.

Police tolerate the level of gambling in pachinko parlors. For example, in May 2005, a parlor in Kanagawa Prefecture reported to the local police that someone had counterfeited their tokens and made off with the equivalent of US$60,000 in cash by trading them in at their nearby exchange center. Even with such information proving that this parlor was illegally operating an exchange center, which by law must be independent of the parlor, the police did not shut them down, but tracked down the thief.

=== Ball designs ===
It is forbidden for pachinko balls to be removed from a parlor to be used elsewhere. To help prevent this, many parlors have a design or name engraved on each of their balls, inspiring some people to collect pachinko balls with various designs.

== Addiction ==

A 2014 study showed that pathological gambling tendencies among Japanese adults was 9.04% in men and 1.6% in women, higher than the North American prevalence of 1.6%, particularly for men. In 1999, 29% of players thought of themselves as addicted and needing treatment. Another 30% said they exceeded their budgets and borrowed money to play.

== Franchising ==

A number of media franchises, mainly the media mix—including Japanese film, anime, manga, television and video game franchises—have generated significant revenue from sales of licensed pachinko and pachislot machines to pachinko parlors and amusement arcades. Sega Sammy Holdings and Konami are two major license holders for most media mix pachinko machines.

Some original pachinko games were adapted into anime (examples include Bakumatsu Gijinden Roman, Battle Girls: Time Paradox, , Yoshimune).

<doc id="57608" wikidata="Q905910" url="?curid=57608" title="Brisbane River">
<text>The Brisbane River (Turrbal: ) is the longest river in South East Queensland, Australia, and flows through the city of Brisbane, before emptying into Moreton Bay on the Coral Sea. John Oxley, the first European to explore the river, named it after the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Thomas Brisbane in 1823. The penal colony of Moreton Bay later adopted the same name, eventually becoming the present city of Brisbane. The river is a tidal estuary and the water is brackish from its mouth through the majority of the Brisbane metropolitan area westward to the Mount Crosby Weir. The river is wide and navigable throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area.

The river travels from Mount Stanley. The river is dammed by the Wivenhoe Dam, forming Lake Wivenhoe, the main water supply for Brisbane. The waterway is a habitat for the rare Queensland lungfish, Brisbane River cod (extinct), and bull sharks.

Early travellers along the waterway admired the natural beauty, abundant fish and rich vegetation along its banks. From 1862 the Brisbane River has been dredged for navigation purposes. The river served as an important carriageway between Brisbane and Ipswich before a railway linking the towns was built in 1875. By the late 1920s, water quality in the river had significantly deteriorated.

Multiple major floods occurred in 1893. In 1974, the most damaging flood on record occurred, causing the 66,000-tonne vessel &quot;Robert Miller&quot; (largest ship ever built on the river) to break free from its mooring. Other major floods occurred in January 2011 and February 2022.

Extensive port facilities have been constructed on the Fisherman Islands, now known as the Port of Brisbane, located at the mouth of the river on Moreton Bay. There are 16 major bridges that cross the river. The Clem Jones Tunnel, opened in 2010, is the river&#x27;s first underground crossing for road transport. The CityCat and KittyCat ferry services deliver passengers along the inner-city reaches of the river.

There are only 20 bullsharks documented to be seen in the Brisbane river to date. These were seen by Liel Daniel.

==Name==
In 1823 John Oxley named the river after the Governor Thomas Brisbane while surveying the area to locate a new penal settlement. The name is of Scottish origin, dating from at least 1643, from their family lands at Rothiebrisbane, Aberdeenshire. This is the name now used by the Queensland Government.

Maiwar is the name of the river in the Turrbal language (the language of an Aboriginal group native to the Brisbane area). The name is also used for the inner-western state electorate of Maiwar.

According to Archibald Meston and Tom Petrie in 1901, the Aboriginal people of the Brisbane area did not have a single name for the river, but rather they named individual reaches and bends.

==Course==
The Brisbane River East and West branches traditionally have their headwaters in the ranges east of Kingaroy. The two branches merge into a single watercourse south of Mount Stanley. Using an alternative modern definition, the source is located at the top of Fig Tree Gully in the Bunya Mountains, which are the headwaters of the river&#x27;s longest tributary Cooyar Creek. Water from the highest point in the catchment has fallen on the Bunya Mountains, 992m above sea level.

The junction of Cooyar Creek and Brisbane River is south of Avoca Vale, and the river then makes its way south past townships including Linville, Moore and Toogoolawah before being joined by the Stanley River, just south of Somerset Dam.

The river runs from there into Lake Wivenhoe, created by the Wivenhoe Dam. Beyond the dam, the river meanders eastward, meeting the Bremer River near Ipswich, then making its way through Brisbane&#x27;s western suburbs, including Jindalee, Indooroopilly and Toowong.

The Brisbane River then flows past wharves including Pinkenba Wharf and Portside Wharf, past Bulwer Island and Luggage Point through the Port of Brisbane and into southern Bramble Bay an embayment of Moreton Bay.

===Kangaroo Point Cliffs===
On the southern side of the river, opposite Gardens Point, are the Kangaroo Point Cliffs; made from Triassic aged volcanic rock of rhyolite composition called Brisbane tuff. The Kangaroo Point Cliffs were created by a quarrying operation that, according to Allan Cunninghams&#x27; Field Book, was underway prior to 1829 when he observed a &quot;&quot;stone wharf presumably used for landing the blocks of stone ferried across the river for the construction of buildings in the settlement&quot;.&quot; This was in the vicinity of Edward Street ferry terminal. Quarrying this volcanic rock formed part of the hard labour undertaken by the convicts of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement, which not only provided the convicts with the punishment of hard labour but also provided the settlement with a useful building material. Many of the early buildings including the Commissariat Store, Brisbane were built by convicts using tuff from this quarry. After the penal settlement was closed, the Petrie family leased the cliffs and quarried the tuff for use in their construction projects, but ultimately quarrying this material became uneconomic without the free labour of the convicts.

The volcanic rock Ignimbrite which formed the cliffs was deposited in the Triassic period about 220 million years ago. They currently form the banks of the Brisbane River.

===Reaches===
A number of the reaches of the Brisbane River are named, including the following listed below (from upstream to downstream), together with their location relative to tributaries of the river and river crossings:
===Tributaries===
The following major tributaries flow into the Brisbane River from the north; Breakfast Creek, Moggill Creek and the Stanley River. On the southside Bulimba Creek, Norman Creek, Oxley Creek, Bremer River and Lockyer Creek waterways enter the Brisbane River. The following smaller creeks also flow into the river; Cressbrook Creek, Cooyar Creek, Cubberla Creek, Black Snake Creek, Wolston Creek, Woogaroo Creek, Goodna Creek, Six Mile Creek, Pullen Pullen Creek and Kholo Creek.

==History==


Before European settlement, the Brisbane River was spiritually important and a vital food source for the Aboriginal people of the Turrbal people, primarily through fishing in the tidal sections downstream. Additionally, fishing and fire-stick farming took place in the upper reaches of the river where there was freshwater, in some seasons.

Four European navigators, namely James Cook, Matthew Flinders, John Bingle and William Edwardson, all visited Moreton Bay but failed to discover the river. The exploration by Flinders took place during his expedition from Port Jackson north to Hervey Bay in 1799. He spent a total of 15 days in the area, touching down at Woody Point and several other spots, but failed to discover the mouth of the river although there were suspicions of its existence. This is consistent with accounts of many other rivers along the east coast of Australia, which could not be found by seaward exploration but were discovered by inland travellers.

On 21 March 1823, four ticket-of-leave convicts sailing south from Sydney on a timber getting mission to Illawarra, Thomas Pamphlett, John Finnegan, Richard Parsons and John Thompson were blown north by a storm. They went 21 days without water, continuing north in the belief they had been blown south, during which time Thompson died. They landed on Moreton Island on 16 April and made it to the mainland on the south of the Brisbane River. They immediately began trekking north in order to return to Sydney, still believing themselves to be somewhere south of Jervis Bay. Subsequently, they became the first known Europeans to discover the river, stumbling across it somewhere near the entrance. They walked upstream along its banks for nearly a month before making their first crossing at Canoe Reach, the junction of Oxley Creek. It was here they stole a small canoe left by the Turrbal people of the region.

John Oxley was Surveyor General of New South Wales when, in the same year and under orders from Governor Brisbane, he sailed into Moreton Bay looking for a suitable new site for a convict settlement to be established. An entry in Oxley&#x27;s diary on 19 November 1823 describes his surprise meeting with one of the shipwrecked men:
:&quot;We rounded the Point Skirmish about 5 o&#x27;clock and observed a number of natives running along the beach towards the vessel, the foremost much lighter in colour than the rest. We were to the last degree astonished when he came abreast the vessel to hear him hail us in good English.&quot;
By that time Pamphlett and Finnegan were living with natives near Bribie Island. Parsons, who had continued to travel north in search of Sydney, was picked up by Oxley on 11 September 1824.

On 2 December 1823, Oxley and Stirling, with Finnegan as a somewhat reluctant guide, entered the river and sailed upstream as far as present-day Goodna. Oxley noted the abundant fish and tall pine trees. Early European explorers marvelled at the sheer natural beauty they witnessed while travelling up the lower reaches.

Reports by early European explorers such as Allan Cunningham and Oxley indicate rainforest once fringed the Brisbane River and its major tributaries, especially on the broader floodplains such as St Lucia and Seventeen Mile Rocks. The coastal lowlands were extensively vegetated with Melaleuca woodlands in low lying, poorly drained coastal areas. When first described by Europeans, the lower reaches of the Brisbane River were fringed by a mosaic of open forest, closed forest and rainforest.
In the same year of 1823, the river was named after Sir Thomas Brisbane, the then Governor of New South Wales. Upon the establishment of a local settlement in 1824, other explorers such as Allan Cunningham, Patrick Logan and Major Edmund Lockyer made expeditions and surveys further upstream, and, in May 1825, the Moreton Bay penal colony at Redcliffe under the command of Heny Miller relocated to North Quay.

The entrance to the Brisbane River was surveyed and marked with buoys in May 1825 by Pilot John M Gray sent from Sydney for the purpose by Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane. Gray also transferred the soldiers and convicts from the First Settlement at Redcliffe at this time. The first small private wharves were built on the river in about 1848. and the once popular, shark-proof river baths were first built in 1857 at Kangaroo Point. By 1850, nearly all the prime alluvial lands in the Brisbane River valley had been taken up by settlers.

From 1862 the Brisbane River has been dredged for navigation purposes. Throughout much of the 20th century large quantities of sand and gravel were extracted from the estuary of the river. Since the rate of materials being deposited is not as high as that which was removed, the river has acted as a subaqueous mine.

In 1865, water police were stationed on board &quot;Proserpine&quot;, a hulk moored at the mouth of the Brisbane River.

In 1866, there was a breakwater built at the junction of the Bremer and Brisbane rivers that was designed to stop shingle from blocking the access to the Bremer&#x27;s boat channel. The first pile light using kerosene was built in 1882. The steel framed light also served as an early port signal station.

In February 1896, one of the river&#x27;s worst disasters occurred with the capsize of the ferry &quot;Pearl&quot; (which struck the anchor chain of the government yacht &quot;Lucinda&quot;) with the loss of around 40 lives.

===20th century===
By 1928, due to the early settlement of Brisbane, the water quality had deteriorated to the point where several public baths had to cease sourcing water from the river. Yet even up to the 1930s, the water was said to be very clear, with reports of people seeing the river bed below the surface. Swimming was once popular at Oxley Point under the Walter Taylor Bridge. In the middle tidal reaches in more recent times, visibility has been about . As Brisbane grew, the condition of the river worsened until at its worst it was no more than an open sewer and waste dump. The banks were cleared of timber and introduced animals and plants rapidly changed the river&#x27;s ecology to its detriment.

On 25 March 1941, a USA goodwill flotilla arrived in the city docking at wharves along the River and built Naval Base Brisbane. The largest ship built on the river was the &quot;Robert Miller&quot;. Construction was near complete when the 66,000 tonne vessel became un-moored in the 1974 Brisbane flood. In 1977, Queen Elizabeth II switched on the Jubilee Fountain positioned in front of the proposed Queensland Cultural Centre. The jets pushed the floodlit river water up to in the air. The floating fountain sank late on the 31 December 1984. 1987 was proclaimed the &quot;Year of the River&quot; by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane at the time, Sallyanne Atkinson.

Over the 20th century, enough obstacles, sand and gravel had been removed from the river that its channel depth increased the tidal flow and tidal range upstream.

=== 21st century ===
On 9 August 2020, it was discovered that Google Maps accidentally changed the Brisbane River name to Ithaca Creek after a complaint that Ithaca Creek was incorrectly named Brisbane River.

===Floods===
The Brisbane River floods frequently, although the occurrence and magnitude of flooding has diminished following the construction of the Wivenhoe Dam on the upper reaches of the River.

Past floods have resulted in both deepening and reduction in river depth, creation of new sand banks and shoals as well as increased transport of suspended sediment from upstream. Before the invention of modern dredging techniques the sediment deposited by flooding created hazards to ships navigating the river. Even medium-sized vessels no longer travel up the Brisbane River beyond the city reach, and dredging of the upper reaches has ceased, allowing the river to recover substantially from the fine silt dislodged by gravel and sand extraction.

Significant floods have occurred several times since the European settlement of Brisbane. There have been 12 Major flood peaks (over 3.5m) recorded at the Brisbane gauge since records began in 1841, including:
* 14 January 1841, with a maximum river level of 8.43m at the gauge, the highest flood level recorded to date
*10 January 1844, 7.1m flood peak at Brisbane.
*February 1863, 3.8m flood peak
*January 1887, 3.8m flood peak
*July 1889, 3.8m flood peak
*March 1890, 5.3m flood peak
* February 1893, a sequence of flood peaks (8.35 metres and 8.09 metres) over two weeks saw the highest recorded flood level in the Brisbane central business district. Seven lives were lost in the Eclipse Colliery at North Ipswich as a direct result of the flooding. Several other people drowned as well.
* June 1897, 5.0m flood peak
* February 1907, 3.6m flood peak
* 27 January 1974, the largest flood to affect Brisbane City in the 20th Century, with a level of 5.45 metres
Post construction of Wivenhoe Dam
* 11 January 2011 with a level of 4.45 metres
* 28 February 2022, 4.0m flood peak

Flooding along the Brisbane River has the potential to be devastating, as documented in 1974, 2011 and 2022. For much of the river&#x27;s length its banks are relatively high, but topped by a broad plain. The river&#x27;s meandering course means that flood waters from upstream cannot be quickly discharged into Moreton Bay. Thus higher than normal flows cause river levels to rise rapidly and once the top of the banks are breached the floodwaters can spread over wide areas of the city.

===Navigation===
There has been much dredging and widening work done over the years to allow ships to transport cargo to and from Brisbane the river is no longer dredged. The river served as an important carriageway between Brisbane and Ipswich before a railway linking the towns was built in 1875. By early 1825 buoys were being laid along the South Passage and shortly after that the first pilots were commissioned to guide ships entering from Moreton Bay and another service for those travelling upstream. Flying boats used the waters of the river in Pinkenba, to take-off for domestic and international destinations in the 1930s.

The river depth was progressively increased and narrow points widened to allow larger vessels into the river and further upstream. For navigation and safety reasons the Seventeen Mile Rocks were completely removed in 1965 after numerous partially successful attempts in the past. The northern river bank at the mouth of the river has undergone reclamation projects over the years, especially in the suburbs of Hamilton and Pinkenba. More recently, extensive facilities for the Port of Brisbane have been constructed on Fisherman&#x27;s Island which has also seen significant land reclamation into the bay.

Early rivers crossings were made using small oared boat ferries, beginning in 1843, followed by steam ferries. In 1865 the first Victoria Bridge, later destroyed in a flood, was built across the river. Professor Hawken of the University of Queensland undertook a study in 1914 to identify the future crossing points for the river.

Historically, the Brisbane River contained upstream bars and shallows and had a natural tidal limit of only . The current tidal limit now extends upstream due to continual channel dredging.

==Crossings==
The first bridge built across the Brisbane River was the original timber Victoria Bridge, opened in 1865 between Brisbane and South Brisbane. The current concrete Victoria Bridge is the 4th to be built on the site, the original bridge collapsed after marine borers weakened its timber piles, and the second was destroyed in the 1893 flood.

 the Brisbane River is crossed by 16 major bridges (counting the new second Gateway, now Sir Leo Hielscher Bridge), including the historic 1940 Story Bridge and the tolled Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges. There are two other major bridges upstream (west) of Brisbane, on the D&#x27;Aguilar Highway and the Brisbane Valley Highway. The Clem Jones Tunnel, opened in 2010, is the river&#x27;s first underground crossing for road transport.

The Moggill Ferry continues to provide a crossing for vehicles northeast of Ipswich.

The Albert Bridge was the first railway crossing of the Brisbane River, opened in 1876. It was destroyed in the 1893 flood and replaced by a 2 span design that is flood tolerant. A second bridge was built adjacent to it, opened in 1957 in conjunction with the quadruplication of the railway between Roma Street and Corinda. The Merivale Bridge, opened in 1978, connects the South Brisbane railway system to the City.

Four bridges have been built that cater for pedestrians and bicycles, being the Goodwill Bridge and Kurilpa Bridge in the City area, the Eleanor Schonell Bridge between Dutton Park and St Lucia (which also caters for public buses to the University of Queensland St Lucia campus), and the Jack Pesch Bridge between Indooroopilly and Chelmer. The Brisbane City Council has announced plans for a pedestrian and cycle only bridge between Kangaroo Point and the city.

===Brisbane Riverwalk===
The Brisbane City Council has developed a network of riverwalk pavements along the banks of the Brisbane River. The Riverwalk runs along much of the Brisbane River foreshore throughout the inner-city area, with the longest span running between Newstead and Toowong. Another popular stretch runs beneath the Kangaroo Point Cliffs between South Brisbane and Kangaroo Point. Several spans of the Riverwalk are built out over the Brisbane River.

An interesting section is the floating walkway between the Story Bridge and Merthyr Road New Farm. Brisbane City planners require many developers of formerly private riverfront blocks to create new sections of the Brisbane Riverwalk that are accessible to the public.

During the 2011 floods, the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman authorised the destruction of the Brisbane Riverwalk to prevent it floating away and becoming a hazard downstream. The proposed demolition of the Riverwalk was later cancelled.

Early in the morning of 13 January 2011 a several hundred metre long section of the Riverwalk broke away from the main structure and floated downstream. Queensland Police temporarily closed the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges (commonly known as the Gateway Bridge) several times as there were fears that sections of Riverwalk could collide with and damage the bridge. The largest part of the floating boardwalk was safely guided under the bridge by a tugboat and past other infrastructure before being safely secured. Other tugs and Water Police guided other Riverwalk sections under the bridge. The damaged Riverwalk was rebuilt as a fixed structure by the Brisbane City Council. The 18-month construction commenced in early 2013 and was completed in September 2014.

===Cross river tunnel===
The Clem Jones Tunnel is currently the only cross river tunnel built in Brisbane. It opened on 16 March 2010. The Cross River Rail tunnel is currently under construction and is expected to be complete in 2024.

==Environmental concerns==
During the 19th century and early 20th century, the river&#x27;s surface was periodically choked by large swathes of the noxious weed known as water hyacinth. The plant was originally imported from South America.

Environmentally, the river is in a poor condition and has been so for many years. In 2000, the Brisbane River estuary did not meet the national guidelines for environmental standards. The lower reaches received a very poor rating in the 2008 Healthy Waterways report, an annual assessment of river water quality. The major causes of pollution are excess nutrients, hydrocarbons, pesticides and bacteria which become concentrated in the river and its sediment after flowing off surrounding lands. The river is also considered too murky and it is not recommended to swim in its waters.
Beginning in the 1950s, the river was dredged for the purpose of extracting sand and gravel. The considerable impacts of that activity include increased turbidity and bank erosion. The effect of the artificial sediment load in Moreton Bay grew to concern environmentalists worried that sediment was choking sea grass paddocks which were grazing territory for dugong. Public outcry led to all commercial dredging being stopped by 1998.
 Non-extractive dredging continues in the Brisbane River in order to maintain its navigability.

In 2018, the water quality in the Brisbane River failed to meet many Queensland Government standards. Nitrogen and phosphorus exceeded the maximum levels in all tests conducted in the mid-Brisbane River catchment. Results in the lower- and upper- catchments found maximum levels exceeded for the majority of tests for nitrogen and nearly all tests for phosphorus. Nitrogen and phosphorus primarily enter the river as they are washed in from agriculture areas on the banks upstream.

In 2019, research at the University of Queensland indicated that the river&#x27;s turbidity cycle (and murky brown colour) is principally driven by exchanges of mud between the channel and mudbanks. However, by planting Crinum pedunculatum in a line parallel to the channel and below the mean water level, the turbidity would reduce to such a degree that the river would appear clear and blue. To date, this has not been attempted 
by Brisbane City Council.

==Flora==
The river has several important ecological areas where remnant populations of mangroves exist; these include areas around drainage culverts, in Breakfast Creek, New Farm, a small preserve at the city bend, near the Queensland University of Technology and around the shipping terminals at the river&#x27;s terminus into Moreton Bay. These mangroves have recently become classified as protected nature reserves. The noxious water hyacinth weed is still growing in stretches between Fernvale and the Mount Crosby Weir but only poses a minimal risk to drinking water supplies.

==Fauna==
===Queensland lungfish===

In 1895–1896, the Queensland lungfish was only found in the Mary and Burnett river systems. Concerned about the species survival, it was introduced into other Queensland waterways with varying success. Self-sustaining populations of lungfish were successfully established in the Brisbane River, the Enoggera Reservoir and the North Pine River.

===Brisbane River cod===
The freshwater reaches of the Brisbane River once supported a unique species of cod, the Brisbane River cod, which was similar to Murray cod and closely related to eastern freshwater cod and Mary River cod. This unique native fish became extinct somewhere between the 1930s and 1950s due to habitat degradation and overfishing. The river has been restocked with cod from the Mary River.

===Bull sharks===
The Brisbane River is home to a very large population of bull sharks, thus swimming is not advised due to the dangers imposed by this predatory fish. Ipswich City Council warns against swimming as far up as Colleges Crossing. There have been four recorded shark attack deaths in the river (1862, 1880, 1901 and 1921), and numerous other fatal attacks in surrounding rivers and estuaries. There have also been numerous attacks on family pets, such as dogs. Bull sharks can grow up to between 7–11.5 feet (2.1–3.5 m) in length and be very aggressively territorial, which are unusual for a shark species because they can inhabit brackish water (containing less than 50% seawater) and are known to tolerate freshwater.

==Water Transport==
The river is traversed by CityCats and other ferries in Brisbane, as it winds its way through the city centre.

==Events==
The Brisbane River hosts numerous events including the Brisbane Festival, Riverfire, and the Brisbane River Classic fishing competition. Many schools and clubs use the river to conduct rowing regattas on Milton Reach. Sailing regattas are also held on this reach as well as the Hamilton reach.

=== Riverfire ===
Riverfire, which began in 1998, was a festival held in September each year at South Bank Parklands and surrounding areas (including the Victoria Bridge), to celebrate the Brisbane River. In 2009, the festival merged with Brisbane Festival. Riverfire, was previously held at the end of the Brisbane Festival until 2022 when it was changed to be held as the festival opener. The event involves an afternoon RAAF aerial display utilising aircraft such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet preceding the main event, a fireworks display extending the length of the Brisbane River from South Bank Parklands to the Storey Bridge.

The RAAF also perform a practice session in the days preceding the event, serving as an opportunity to both practice beforehand and also promote Riverfire. One of the most popular RAAF aircraft to perform at Riverfire was the F-111 which was known for performing a &#x27;dump-and-burn&#x27; above the city. The final F-111 dump-and-burn of Riverfire occurred in 2010 was able to be seen as far as the Gold Coast and Toowoomba as the F-111 climbed from to a higher altitude of about . The 20th Riverfire attracted nearly 500,000 people to the river.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Riverfire was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an &quot;Events and festivals&quot;.

== Named in its honour ==
The electoral district of Maiwar created in the 2017 Queensland state electoral redistribution was named after the river&#x27;s indigenous name.

<text>Nursultan Abishuly Nazarbayev (born 6 July 1940) is a Kazakh politician who served as the first president of Kazakhstan from 1991 to 2019. He also held the special title of Elbasy from 2010 to 2022 and chairman of the Security Council from 1991 to 2022.

Nazarbayev’s political career began in the Soviet era, where he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1962 while working as a steel factory worker. Rising through the party ranks, he became Prime Minister of the Kazakh SSR in 1984 and First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan in 1989. In 1990, the Supreme Soviet elected him as the president of Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev played a key role in navigating Kazakhstan through the dissolution of the Soviet Union, leading to the country&#x27;s independence in 1991. In the country’s first direct 1991 presidential election, Nazarbayev appeared on the ballot without opposition and secured an overwhelming victory. In 1995, ruling by decree, Nazarbayev extended his presidency through a referendum and adopted a new constitution that expanded his powers. He was re-elected in 1999, deemed eligible to run again in 2005 by a Supreme Court ruling, and benefited from a 2007 constitutional amendment solely exempting term limits for him, allowing re-elections in 2011 and 2015.

Under Nazarbayev&#x27;s rule, Kazakhstan experienced substantial economic growth, driven by high oil prices and market-oriented reforms. His policies focused on modernizing infrastructure, attracting foreign investment, and positioning Kazakhstan as an economic hub in Central Asia. On the international stage, he prioritized strong ties with global powers and Kazakhstan&#x27;s integration into regional and global organizations, including the Eurasian Economic Union and the World Trade Organization. Nazarbayev also gained recognition for his efforts in nuclear disarmament, renouncing Kazakhstan’s inherited nuclear arsenal, and closing the Semipalatinsk Test Site. However, his presidency was also marked by widespread corruption, nepotism, kleptocracy, and economic challenges, such as the Great Recession, the 2010s oil glut, and economic repercussions from the Russo-Ukrainian War. These issues contributed to inflation and the devaluation of the national currency, the tenge, while undermining transparency and governance.

In March 2019, following a wave of protests and increasing discontent, Nazarbayev announced his resignation, handing over power to Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Tokayev was elected president in a snap election in June 2019. While Nazarbayev stepped down from the presidency, he remained a powerful figure in Kazakh politics, retaining influence through his leadership of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan and the Nur Otan party. He also chaired the Security Council until his dismissal in 2022. Nazarbayev’s power was diminished following the 2022 unrest, which led to a constitutional referendum that stripped him of many privileges and titles, including his membership in the Senate and the Constitutional Council. By 2023, he had lost most of his official titles, signaling the end of his political dominance.

Nazarbayev was one of the longest-ruling non-royal leaders in the world, having led Kazakhstan for nearly three decades, excluding chairmanship in the Security Council after the end of his presidency. He has often been referred to as a dictator due to his consolidation of power and autocratic rule. While he is credited with fostering economic growth and political stability in Kazakhstan, his tenure was marred by widespread authoritarianism, significant human rights abuses, and systemic corruption. His leadership was further characterized by a pervasive cult of personality, with his image and influence deeply entrenched in the nation’s political and social landscape.

==Early life and career==

Nazarbayev was born in Chemolgan, a rural town near Almaty, when Kazakhstan was one of the republics of the Soviet Union, to parents Ábish Nazarbayev (1903–1970) and Aljan Nazarbayeva (1910–1978). His father Ábish was a poor labourer who worked for a wealthy local family until Soviet rule confiscated the family&#x27;s farmland in the 1930s during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s collectivization policy. Following this, his father took the family to the mountains to live out a nomadic existence. His family&#x27;s religious tradition was Sunni Islam.

Äbish avoided compulsory military service due to a withered arm he had sustained when putting out a fire. At the end of World War II, the family returned to the village of Chemolgan where in 1948, Nazarbayev began attending school and being taught the Russian language; while living with his paternal uncle, as his parents had not owned dwelling in the place for a brief period. Nazarbayev later himself chose to settle in the upper part of Chemolgan where mainly ethnic Russians lived, in order to master Russian while communicating with them. Despite performing well at school, by the time Nazarbayev was in 10th grade, all the classes in the same grade were called off due to a student shortage and as a result in 1957, he was sent to a boarding school named after Abai Qunanbaiuly in Kaskelen. During that time, Nazarbayev&#x27;s father, Äbish, wished to create favourable conditions towards his son for studying and living as well as to potentially avoid bad influence from peers by renting himself an apartment for Nazarbayev in the village.

After leaving school, Nazarbayev took up a one-year, government-funded scholarship at the Karaganda Steel Mill in Temirtau. He also spent time training at a steel plant in Dniprodzerzhynsk, and therefore was away from Temirtau when riots broke out there over working conditions. By the age of 20, he was earning a relatively good wage doing &quot;incredibly heavy and dangerous work&quot; in the blast furnace. From there, Nazarbayev married Sara Nazarbayeva on 25 August 1962, who was a dispatcher at the same steel mill that he worked in. Together, both parties would eventually have three daughters: Dariga, Dinara and Aliya, born in 1963, 1968 and 1980, respectively.

On 15 November 1962, Nazarbayev joined the Communist Party, becoming a prominent member of the Young Communist League (Komsomol) and full-time worker for the party, while attending the Karagandy Polytechnic Institute. He was appointed secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Karaganda Metallurgical Kombinat in 1972, and four years later became Second Secretary of the Karaganda Regional Party Committee.

In his role as a bureaucrat, Nazarbayev dealt with legal papers, logistical problems, and industrial disputes, as well as meeting workers to solve individual issues. He later wrote that &quot;the central allocation of capital investment and the distribution of funds&quot; meant that infrastructure was poor, workers were demoralised and overworked, and centrally set targets were unrealistic; he saw the steel plant&#x27;s problems as a microcosm for the problems for the Soviet Union as a whole.

===Rise to power===
In 1984, at the age 43, Nazarbayev became the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan (Chairman of the Council of Ministers), the youngest-ever officeholder in the Soviet Union to serve the post, under Dinmukhamed Kunaev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan. During that period, the Perestroika policies slowly began to take place under Mikhail Gorbachev while Nazarbayev himself was viewed to be more of experienced policy maker as his views and stances had already been formed during the Khrushchev Thaw and 1965 Soviet economic reform. Kazakhstan at that time was seen as a backwater republic within the Soviet Union with its industry being heavily reliant upon rich raw materials, specifically in mining sectors and was forced upon to import its consumer goods from other Soviet republics. It faced problems especially in countryside with a need state farm repairs, as well as housing for farmers, lack of available preschools for rural children which Nazarbayev during his tenure raised issues in regard to these problems that was reportedly met with disagreements amongst the republic&#x27;s leadership.

Growing frustrated over the problems within the Kazakh SSR, at the 16th Session of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan held in January 1986, Nazarbayev criticized Askar Kunayev, head of the Academy of Sciences, for not reforming his department. Dinmukhamed, Nazarbayev&#x27;s boss and Askar&#x27;s brother, felt deeply angered and betrayed. Kunayev went to Moscow and demanded Nazarbayev&#x27;s dismissal while Nazarbayev&#x27;s supporters campaigned for Kunayev&#x27;s dismissal and Nazarbayev&#x27;s promotion.

Kunayev was ousted in 1986 and replaced by Gennady Kolbin, an ethnic Russian, who despite his office, had little authority in Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev was named party leader and the top position (First Secretary of the Communist Party) on 22 June 1989, only the second Kazakh (after Kunayev) to hold the post. He was the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet (head of state) from 22 February to 24 April 1990.

On 24 April 1990, Nazarbayev was elected as the first President of Kazakhstan by the Supreme Soviet. He supported Russian President Boris Yeltsin against the attempted coup in August 1991 by Soviet hardliners. Nazarbayev was close enough to Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev for Gorbachev to consider him for the post of Vice President of the Soviet Union; however, Nazarbayev turned the offer down. However, on 29 July, Gorbachev, Yeltsin, and Nazarbayev discussed and decided that once the New Union Treaty was signed, Nazarbayev would replace Valentin Pavlov as Premier of the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union disintegrated following the failed coup, though Nazarbayev was highly concerned with maintaining the close economic ties between Kazakhstan and Russia. In the country&#x27;s first presidential election, held on 1 December, he appeared alone on the ballot and won 95% of the vote. On 21 December, he signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, taking Kazakhstan into the Commonwealth of Independent States.

== Presidency (1990–2019) ==

=== 1991–1999: First term ===

Nazarbayev renamed the former State Defense Committees as the Ministry of Defense and appointed Sagadat Nurmagambetov as Defense Minister on 7 May 1992.

The Supreme Soviet, under the leadership of Chairman Serikbolsyn Abdilin, began debating over a draft constitution in June 1992. Opposition political parties Azat, Jeltoqsan and the Republican Party, held demonstrations in Alma-Ata from 10 to 17 June 1992 calling for the formation of a coalition government, resignation of Sergey Tereshchenko&#x27;s government and the Supreme Soviet which, at that time, was composed of former Communist Party legislators who had yet to stand in an election. The Constitution, adopted on 28 January 1993, created a strong executive branch with limited checks on executive power.

On 10 December 1993, the Supreme Soviet voted to dissolve itself and that same day, a presidential decree was signed which set changes in local representative and executive bodies with elections of the mäslihats (local legislatures) taking place every five years and äkims (local heads) being appointed by the president. In March 1994, Kazakhstan for the first time since independence, held a legislative election which was boycotted by the Azat and Jeltoqsan parties. From there, the pro-presidential People&#x27;s Union of Kazakhstan Unity party won a majority of 30 seats with independent candidates who were on presidential-list won 42 seats. The OSCE observers called the elections unfair, reporting an inflated voter turnout. Nevertheless, the new composition of the Parliament was considered to be &quot;professional&quot; with different various political factions that functioned. In May 1994, the Supreme Council passed a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko amidst political scandals evolving Tereshchenko and government ministers. Nazarbayev objected to the change, arguing that the Constitution gave the president the right to appoint the PM with already existing parliamentary confirmation regardless of the motion of confidence. However, he eventually backed down, dismissing Tereshchenko&#x27;s government in October 1994 and appointing ethnic-Kazakh Akezhan Kazhegeldin as the new PM.

In 1994, Nazarbayev suggested relocating the capital city from Almaty to Astana, and the official changeover of the capital happened on 10 December 1997.

In March 1995, the Constitutional Court ruled that 1994 legislative elections were held unconstitutionally and as a result, Nazarbayev dissolved the Supreme Council. From that period, all bills were adopted on the basis of presidential decrees such as outlawing any civic participation in an unregistered and/or illegal public association who would be punished with 15-day jail sentence or fines from 5 to 10 times the minimum monthly wage in an effort &quot;to fight organized crime.&quot; An April 1995 referendum extended Nazarbayev&#x27;s term, originally set to end in 1996, to until 2000. In August 1995, a referendum was held which allowed for greater presidential powers and established a bicameral Parliament as well. Both the elections for Mazhilis (lower house) and the Senate (upper house) were held in December 1995 which convened in January 1996. Nazarbayev dismissed the accusations from critics of him personally dissolving the legislature by claiming that it was under Constitutional Court&#x27;s orders, saying &quot;the law is the law, and the President is obliged to abide by the constitution, otherwise, how will we build a rule-of-law state?&quot; and that the cancellation of the 1996 presidential elections was made by the decision of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan arguing that &quot;Western schemes do not work in our Eurasian expanses.&quot;

In October 1997, Nazarbayev dismissed Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin from his post, which according to political experts was seen as a &quot;power grab&quot;. In his address, he criticized Kazhegeldin over his record reforms and in his place, Nazarbayev appointed Nurlan Balgimbayev, an oil engineer who prior served as an Oil and Gas Minister.

=== 1999–2006: Second term ===

On 7 October 1998, a number of amendments were made to the Constitution of Kazakhstan in which the term of office of the president was increased from 5 to 7 years as well as term limits. The changes also removed restriction on the maximum required age of a presidential candidate. The following day on 8 October, Nazarbayev signed decree setting the election date for January 1999. He was reelected for second term by winning 81% of the vote, defeating his main challenger and former Supreme Council chairman Serikbolsyn Abdildin. Abdildin himself in response refused to acknowledge the official results, insisting that they were falsified.

In February 1999, several pro-presidential parties formed into one party named Otan. At the Founding Congress of the party which was held on 1 March 1999, Nazarbayev was elected as the chairman. From there, he suggested that former PM Sergey Tereshchenko should take over the leading role, noting the constitutional limits on president&#x27;s affiliation with political parties while Nazarbayev himself remained as &quot;de facto&quot; party leader. In July 1999, Nazarbayev signed decree setting the date for the legislative elections. The Otan, for the first time, participated in the elections, winning 23 seats. In the aftermath on 1 October 1999, Nazarbayev appointed Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as the PM after his predecessor Nurlan Balgimbayev had faced an increasing unpopularity amidst worsening economy and scandal revolving around an arms deal with North Korea.

Nazarbayev appointed Altynbek Sarsenbayev, who at the time served as the Minister of Culture, Information and Concord, the Secretary of the Security Council, replacing Marat Tazhin, on 4 May 2001. Tazhin became the Chairman of the National Security Committee, replacing Alnur Mussayev. Mussayev became the head of the Presidential Security Service.

In January 2002, Prime Minister Kassym-Jomart Tokayev resigned from his post and was subsequently appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and State Secretary. Imangali Tasmagambetov took over Tokayev&#x27;s role as the new PM which viewed as a response towards a political crisis which occurred following the formation of the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan in November 2001 by several prominent Kazakh officials who called for political and democratic reforms. Tasmagambetov&#x27;s government was short-lived, facing opposition by the Parliament over his proposed policies on land privatisation which led to a motion of no confidence against him. Tasmagambetov resigned in June 2003 and Nazarbayev appointed Daniyal Akhmetov to lead the government citing the reason &quot;to intensify the pace of social and economic development.&quot;

=== 2006–2011: Third term ===
In June 2000, the Constitutional Council announced its resolution which declared that Nazarbayev&#x27;s second term was, in fact, his first due to the adaptation of the new Kazakh Constitution which took place in 1995 during Nazarbayev&#x27;s first term. This allowed him the opportunity to run for another election as his term was set to end in 2007. 

On 4 December 2005, new presidential elections were held where Nazarbayev won by an overwhelming majority of 91.15% (from a total of 6,871,571 eligible participating voters). Nazarbayev was sworn in for another seven-year term on 11 January 2006.

In 2006, the Otan increased its ranks as all pro-presidential parties began merging into one. Nazarbayev supported the move, stating the need for there to be fewer, but stronger parties that &quot;efficiently defend the interests of the population.&quot; In December 2006, the Otan renamed itself into Nur Otan and on 4 July 2007, Nazarbayev was re-elected as the party&#x27;s chairman.

Amidst the political shakeup, Nazarbayev dismissed Prime Minister Daniyal Akhmetov in January 2007 and appointed Deputy PM Karim Massimov to the post. He stated that Massimov had the &quot;sufficient knowledge and experience&quot; to &quot;develop Kazakhstan&#x27;s successes.&quot; On 18 May 2007, the Parliament of Kazakhstan approved a constitutional amendment which allowed the incumbent president—himself—to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms. This amendment applied specifically and only to Nazarbayev: the original constitution&#x27;s prescribed maximum of two five-year terms will still apply to all future presidents of Kazakhstan. That same year in August, legislative elections were held from which the Nur Otan won all the contested seats in the Mazhilis, eliminating any form of opposition which sparked controversy and criticism from international organizations and groups within the country. In response, Kazakhstan introduced an amendment by allowing for a two-party system since any party that wins second place in race—regardless or not if it passes the 7% electoral threshold—would be guaranteed to have representation in the Parliament.

Nazarbayev has always emphasized the role of education in the nation&#x27;s social development. In order to make education affordable, on 13 January 2009, he introduced educational grant &quot;Orken&quot; for the talented youth of Kazakhstan. This decree was amended on 23 September 2016.

In 2009, former UK Cabinet Minister Jonathan Aitken released a biography of the Kazakh leader entitled &quot;Nazarbayev and the Making of Kazakhstan&quot;. The book took a generally pro-Nazarbayev stance, asserting in the introduction that he is mostly responsible for the success of modern Kazakhstan.

=== 2011–2015: Fourth term ===

In April 2011, Nazarbayev ran for a fourth term, winning 95.5% of the vote with virtually no opposition candidates. Following his victory, he announced the need in finding an &quot;optimal way of empowering parliament, increasing the government&#x27;s responsibility and improving the electoral process.&quot;

On 11 June 2011, Daniel Witt, Vice Chairman of the Eurasia Foundation, acknowledged the role of Nazarbayev and his political reforms:&quot;[President] Nazarbayev has led Kazakhstan through difficult times and into an era of prosperity and growth. He has demonstrated that he values his U.S. and Western alliances and is committed to achieving democratic governance.&quot;In December 2011, opponents of Nazarbayev rioted in Mangystau, described by the BBC as the biggest opposition movement of his time in power. On 16 December 2011, demonstrations in the oil town of Zhanaozen clashed with police on the country&#x27;s Independence Day. Fifteen people were shot dead by security forces and almost 100 people were injured. Protests quickly spread to other cities but then died down. The subsequent trial of demonstrators uncovered mass abuse and torture of detainees. 
On 24 September 2012, Nazarbayev appointed Serik Akhmetov as the PM, a close-ally of Nazarbayev who served as First Deputy PM under Massimov&#x27;s cabinet and the Äkim of Karaganda Region. Massimov in turn, became the new head of the Presidential Administration.

In December 2012, Nazarbayev outlined a forward-looking national strategy called the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy.

In 2014, Nazarbayev proposed that Kazakhstan should change its name to &quot;Kazakh Eli&quot; (&quot;Country of the Kazakhs&quot;), for the country to attract better and more foreign investment, since &quot;Kazakhstan&quot; by its name is associated with other &quot;-stan&quot; countries. Nazarbayev suggested Mongolia receives more investment than Kazakhstan because it is not a &quot;-stan&quot; country, even though it is in the same neighborhood, and not as stable as Kazakhstan. However, he noted that decision should be decided by the people on whether the country should change its name.

After Kazakhstan faced an economic downturn of which was caused by low oil prices and devaluation of the tenge, Nazarbayev on 2 April 2014 dismissed PM Serik Akhmetov and reappointed Karim Massimov to the post. Akhmetov subsequently was appointed as a Defence Minister while Massimov&#x27;s government was aimed at dealing with the economic crisis.

=== 2015–2019: Fifth and final term ===
Nazarbayev for the last time ran again in the 2015 presidential election for the fifth term. From there, he gathered 97.7% of the vote share, making it one of the biggest in Kazakhstan&#x27;s history. In his victory speech, he emphasized the top priority in Nurly Zhol stimulus package that was designed in softening the social blow caused by economic troubles. At a later news conference, Nazarbayev speaking about the electoral results remarked, &quot;I apologize that for superdemocratic states such figures are unacceptable. But I could do nothing. If I had interfered, I would have looked undemocratic, right?&quot; The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe criticized the election as falling short of international democratic standards.

In early 2016, it was announced that 1.7 million hectares of agricultural land would be sold at an auction. This sparked rare protests around the country which called for Nazarbayev to stop the momentum on land sales and solve the nation&#x27;s problems as well. In response to the fears of the lands being sold to foreigners, especially Chinese, Nazarbayev fired back at claims, calling them &quot;groundless&quot; and warned that any provocateur would be punished. On 1 May 2016, at the Kazakhstan People&#x27;s Unity Day, Nazarbayev warned that without unity and stability, a crisis similarly in Ukraine would happen. In June 2016, armed attacks in Aktobe took place resulting in deaths of 25 people. Nazarbayev called the incident as terrorist attacks which were orchestrated from abroad to destabilize the country similarly in a colour revolution to which he accused of being infiltrated by the ISIS militants.On 8 September 2016, Nazarbayev appointed Karim Massimov as the National Security Committee Chairman and Bakhytzhan Sagintayev to the post of the PM. Days later on 13 September, Nazarbayev&#x27;s daughter Dariga was appointed as the member of the Senate. This suggested that Nazarbayev was preparing for his succession to be taken over by Dariga as the cabinet reshuffling had occurred after Uzbek President Islam Karimov&#x27;s death which created political uncertainty in the neighboring country. Nazarbayev dismissed the claims of hereditary succession in an interview to the Bloomberg News in November 2016, saying that the &quot;transfer of power is spelled out by the Constitution.&quot;

In January 2017, Nazarbayev proposed constitutional reforms, which would allow for the Parliament to have greater role in decision making, calling it &quot;a consistent and logical step in the development of the state&quot;. The Parliament approved several amendments to the Constitution on 5 March 2017, making the president no longer able to override parliamentary votes of no-confidence, while giving the legislative branch to form a government cabinet, implementing state programs and policies. The move was seen as way by Nazarbayev to ensure the potential of a peaceful transfer of power.

Nazarbayev, along with seventeen heads of state and government from around the world, which included Felipe VI of Spain and leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization member countries, consisting of Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and India, attended the opening ceremony of Expo 2017 which was held in Astana. An estimated 3.86 million people visited the site with Nazarbayev at the closing ceremony on 10 September 2017 calling it as &quot;Kazakhstan&#x27;s most brilliant achievements since its independence.&quot;

Senate Chairman Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in an interview to BBC News in June 2018, suggested that Nazarbayev&#x27;s term presidential from 2015 was in fact, the last one as he hinted the possibility that Nazarbayev would not run for re-election which was scheduled for 2020. Minister of Information and Communications Dauren Abaev responded to Tokayev&#x27;s statements claiming that &quot;there&#x27;s still a lot of time&quot; for Nazarbayev to decide on whether to run for re-election pointing out that the decision will be primarily based on his. He also added that the country would only benefit if Nazarbayev chooses to run for sixth term.

====Resignation====
On 19 March 2019, following unusually persistent protests in cities across the country, Nazarbayev announced his resignation as President of Kazakhstan, citing the need for &quot;a new generation of leaders&quot;. The announcement was broadcast in a televised address in Astana after which he signed a decree ending his powers from 20 March 2019. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, speaker of the upper house of parliament, was appointed as president of the country until the end of the presidential term.

Notwithstanding his resignation as president, he continued to head the ruling Nur Otan party and remains a member of the Constitutional Council. In his televised address Nazarbayev pointed out that he had been granted the honorary status of &quot;elbasy&quot; (leader of the nation, leader of the people), the title bestowed upon him by parliament in 2010. The title was later removed due to the cancellation of the Law on the First President.

Various colleagues of Nazarbayev reacted within hours of the announcement, with Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev holding a telephone conversation with Nazarbayev, calling him a &quot;great politician&quot;. In a cabinet meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin praised Nazarbayev&#x27;s leadership, even going as far as to say that the Eurasian Economic Union was Nazarbayev&#x27;s &quot;brainchild&quot;. Other world leaders who sent messages to Nazarbayev included Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan, Alexander Lukashenko, President of Belarus, and Emomali Rahmon, President of Tajikistan.

According to Nazarbayev himself, he described his intention for stepping down was due to &quot;peak of trust&quot; by the people and that it was &quot;necessary to leave&quot;, recalling his memories in attending funerals of Soviet leaders Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, embarking that &quot;there is still a limit of human capabilities.&quot;

===Allegations of corruption===

Over the course of Nazarbayev&#x27;s presidency, an increasing number of accusations of corruption and favoritism were directed against Nazarbayev and his circle. Critics said that the country&#x27;s government came to resemble a clan system.

According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, in 1999 Swiss banking officials discovered $85 million in an account apparently belonging to Nazarbayev; the money, intended for the Kazakh treasury, had in part been transferred through accounts linked to James Giffen. Subsequently, Nazarbayev successfully pushed for a parliamentary bill granting him legal immunity, as well as another designed to legalise money laundering, angering critics further. When Kazakh opposition newspaper &quot;Respublika&quot; reported in 2002 that Nazarbayev had in the mid-1990s secretly stashed away $1 billion of state oil revenue in Swiss bank accounts, the decapitated carcass of a dog was left outside the newspaper&#x27;s offices, with a warning reading &quot;There won&#x27;t be a next time&quot;; the dog&#x27;s head later turned up outside editor Irina Petrushova&#x27;s apartment, with a warning reading &quot;There will be no last time.&quot; The newspaper was firebombed as well.
In May 2007, the Parliament of Kazakhstan approved a constitutional amendment which would allow Nazarbayev to seek re-election as many times as he wishes. This amendment applies specifically and only to Nazarbayev, since it states that the first president will have no limits on how many times he can run for office, but subsequent presidents will be restricted to a five-year term.

, Kazakhstan has never held an election meeting international standards.

In May 2018, the Parliament of Kazakhstan passed a constitutional amendment allowing Nazarbayev to serve as Chairman of the Security Council for life. These reforms, which were approved by the Constitutional Council on 28 June, also expanded the powers of the Security Council, granting it the status of a constitutional body. The amendment states that, &quot;The decisions of the security council and the chairman of the security council are mandatory and are subject to strict execution by state bodies, organisations and officials of the Republic of Kazakhstan.&quot;

In December 2020, according to an investigative report by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, it was identified at least $785 million in European and U.S. real estate purchases made by Nazarbaev&#x27;s family members and their in-laws in six countries over a 20-year span. This figure includes a handful of properties that have since been sold, including multimillion-dollar apartments in the United States bought by Nazarbaev&#x27;s brother, Bolat. It does not include a sprawling Spanish estate owned by Kulibaev, for which a purchase price could not be found.

=== Domestic policy ===
====Economic issues====

After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan faced mass unemployment and emigration. Nazarbayev was viewed to have followed Russia&#x27;s economic reforms starting with price liberalisations. On 3 January 1992, he signed a decree &quot;On measures to liberalise prices&quot;, an attempt to stabilise the country&#x27;s socio-economic situation and form a market economy within Kazakhstan. This resulted in a rapid inflation of goods, causing discontent amongst citizens, thus forcing Nazarbayev on 12 January to sign a &quot;On additional measures for social protection of the population in the context of price liberalisation&quot; which established partial state-regulated prices on bread, bakery products and flour.

Throughout the 1990s, privatisation and banking reforms took place in Kazakhstan. In June 1994, Nazarbayev amended the Parliament&#x27;s Economic Memorandum for the next three years, which has been defined as an economic strategy. It included strict measures to reform the economy and establish macroeconomic stability and set the task of carrying out rapid and vigorous privatization. During the introduction of the National Bank of Kazakhstan in December 1993, significant changes were made in which all specialized banks were transformed into a joint stock company, and the National Bank was granted a number of powers. In March 1995, Nazarbayev signed decree setting the National Bank as an independent entity that is accountable only for the head of state.

Kazakhstan managed to avoid full impact from the 1997 Asian financial crisis and 1998 Russian financial crisis, due to lack of high liquid investments. Nazarbayev pledged for to continue in advancing for an &quot;independent, open and free market economy.&quot; Starting from early 2000&#x27;s, the Kazakh economy faced huge growth thanks to its development in energy sector and high oil prices. Nazarbayev published his manifesto: &quot;Prosperity, Security and the Ever-Growing Welfare of all Kazakhstanis&quot; in 2000, where he wrote that &quot;today we are building a new state, a new market economy and a new democracy, and this—at the very time when many other independent states have already trodden that path similar enough.&quot;

Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Nazarbayev assured the nation in October 2008 that it would deal with the crisis by introducing a rescue package amounted to 10% of the country&#x27;s GDP, of which was funded thanks in part to the national sovereign wealth fund. In his state of address on 6 March 2009, he announced 350,000 jobs for workers in the spheres of infrastructure projects as well as the creation of the Eurasian Land Bridge.

Since 2014, Nazarbayev has set strategic priority in Kazakhstan for economic diversification which would maintain the country&#x27;s stability by avoiding the effects from its oil export reliance that would affect the economy through its constant price downfalls.

=====Eurasian Economic Union=====

In 1994, Nazarbayev suggested the idea of creating a &quot;Eurasian Union&quot; during a speech at Moscow State University. On 29 May 2014, alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko, Nazarbayev signed the founding treaty of the Eurasian Union (EEU) in Astana, paving the way for the transition from their current customs union to the full-fledged EEU on 1 January 2015. Nazarbayev named Honorary Chairman of Supreme Eurasian Economic Council in May 2019.

=====Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy=====

Nazarbayev unveiled in his 2012 State of the Nation the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy, a long-term strategy to ensure future growth prospects of Kazakhstan, and position Kazakhstan as one of the top 30 most developed nations in the world.

=====Nurly Zhol=====

President Nazarbayev unveiled in 2014 a multibillion-dollar domestic modernization and reformation plan called &quot;Nurly Zhol – The Path to the Future&quot;. It was officially approved by the Decree of the President on 6 April 2015. The goal of the plan was for development and improvement of tourist, industrial and housing infrastructure, create 395,500 new jobs, and increase the GDP growth rate 15.7 by 2019.

In March 2019, it was announced that the program would be extended to 2025 with its new agenda being focused on developing road infrastructure. According to Minister of Infrastructure and Development Beibut Atamkulov, it is planned that 27,000 kilometres of local roads will be repaired, with 21,000 kilometres of national roads being reconstructed and repaired.

=====Digital Kazakhstan=====
President Nazarbayev unveiled this technological modernization initiative to increase Kazakhstan&#x27;s economic competitiveness through the digital ecosystem development.

===Environmental issues===
In his 1998 autobiography, Nazarbayev wrote that &quot;The shrinking of the Aral Sea, because of its scope, is one of the most serious ecological disasters being faced by our planet today. It is not an exaggeration to put it on the same level as the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.&quot; He called on Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and the wider world to do more to reverse the environmental damage done during the Soviet era.

===Nuclear disarmament ===
Kazakhstan inherited from the Soviet Union the world&#x27;s fourth-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. Within four years of independence, Kazakhstan possessed zero nuclear weapons. In one of the new government&#x27;s first major decisions, Nazarbayev closed the Soviet nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk (Semei), where 456 nuclear tests had been conducted by the Soviet military.

During the Soviet era, over 500 military experiments with nuclear weapons were conducted by scientists in the Kazakhstan region, mostly at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, causing radiation sickness and birth defects. As the influence of the Soviet Union waned, Nazarbayev closed the site. He later claimed that he had encouraged Olzhas Suleimenov&#x27;s anti-nuclear movement in Kazakhstan, and was always fully committed to the group&#x27;s goals. In what was dubbed &quot;Project Sapphire&quot;, the Kazakhstan and United States governments worked closely together to dismantle former Soviet weapons stored in the country, with the Americans agreeing to fund over $800 million in transportation and &quot;compensation&quot; costs.

Nazarbayev encouraged the United Nations General Assembly to establish 29 August as the International Day Against Nuclear Tests. In his article he has proposed a new Non-Proliferation Treaty &quot;that would guarantee clear obligations on the part of signatory governments and define real sanctions for those who fail to observe the terms of the agreement.&quot; His foreign minister signed a treaty authorizing the Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone on 8 September 2006.

In an oped in &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Nazarbayev called for the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty to be modernized and better balanced.

In March 2016, Nazarbayev released his &quot;Manifesto: The World. The 21st century.&quot; In this manifest he called for expanding and replicating existing nuclear weapon-free zones and stressed the need to modernise existing international disarmament treaties.

===Religion===

Nazarbayev put forward the initiative of holding a forum of world and traditional religions in Astana. Earlier the organisers of similar events were only representatives of leading religions and denominations. Among other similar events aimed at establishing interdenominational dialogue were the meetings of representatives of world religions and denominations held in Assisi, Italy, in October 1986 and January 2002. The first Congress of World and Traditional Religions which gathered in 2003 allowed the leaders of all major religions to develop prospects for mutual cooperation.

Nazarbayev initially espoused anti-religious views during the Soviet era; he later made attempts to support Muslim heritage by performing the Hajj pilgrimage, and supporting mosque renovations.

Under the leadership of Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan enacted some degrees of multiculturalism in order to retain and attract talents from diverse ethnic groups among its citizenry, and even from nations that are developing ties of cooperation with the country, in order to coordinate human resources onto the state-guided path of global market economic participation. This principle of the Kazakh leadership has earned it the name &quot;Singapore of the Steppes&quot;.

However, in 2012, Nazarbayev proposed reforms, which were later enacted by the parliament, imposing stringent restrictions on religious practices. Religious groups were required to re-register, or face closure. The initiative was explained as an attempt to combat extremism. However, under the new law, many minority religious groups are deemed illegal. In order to exist on a local level, a group must have more than 50 members: more than 500 on a regional level, and more than 5,000 on the national level.

===Nationalism===
In 2014, Vladimir Putin&#x27;s remarks regarding the historicity of Kazakhstan, in which he stated that Nazarbayev &quot;created a state on a territory that never had a state ... Kazakhs never had any statehood, he has created it&quot; led to a severe response from Nazarbayev. Four years later, in February 2018, Reuters reported that &quot;Kazakhstan further loosened cultural ties with its former political masters in Moscow ... when a ban on speaking Russian in cabinet meetings took effect ... [Nazarbayev] has also ordered all parliamentary hearings to be held in Kazakh, saying those who are not fluent must be provided with simultaneous translations.&quot;

===Human rights record===
Kazakhstan&#x27;s human rights situation under Nazarbayev is uniformly described as poor by independent observers. Human Rights Watch says that &quot;Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly, speech, and religion. In 2014, authorities closed newspapers, jailed or fined dozens of people after peaceful but unsanctioned protests, and fined or detained worshippers for practicing religion outside state controls. Government critics, including opposition leader Vladimir Kozlov, remained in detention after unfair trials. In mid-2014, Kazakhstan adopted new criminal, criminal executive, criminal procedural, and administrative codes, and a new law on trade unions, which contain articles restricting fundamental freedoms and are incompatible with international standards. Torture remains common in places of detention.&quot;

Kazakhstan is ranked 161 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders.

===Rule of law===
According to a US government report released in 2014, in Kazakhstan:


Kazakhstan&#x27;s global rank in the World Justice Project&#x27;s 2015 Rule of Law Index was 65 out of 102; the country scored well on &quot;Order and Security&quot; (global rank 32/102), and poorly on &quot;Constraints on Government Powers&quot; (global rank 93/102), &quot;Open Government&quot; (85/102) and &quot;Fundamental Rights&quot; (84/102, with a downward trend marking a deterioration in conditions). Kazakhstan&#x27;s global rank in the World Justice Project&#x27;s 2020 Rule of Law Index rose and was 62 out 128. Its global rank on &quot;Order and Security&quot; remained high (39/128) and low on &quot;Constraints on Government Powers&quot; (102/128), &quot;Open Government&quot; (81/128) and &quot;Fundamental Rights&quot; (100/128).

The National plan &quot;100 concrete steps&quot; introduced by President Nazarbayev included measures to reform the court system of Kazakhstan, including the introduction of mandatory jury trials for certain categories of crimes (Step 21) and the creation of local police service (Step 30). The implementation of the national plan resulted in Kazakhstan&#x27;s transition from a five-tier judicial system to a three-tier one in early 2016 yet it severely restricted access to the cassation review of cases by the Supreme Court. However, the expansion of jury trials has not been implemented. Furthermore, Nazarbayev abolished the local police service in 2018 following the public outrage over the murder of Denis Ten in downtown Almaty.

===Foreign policy===

During Nazarbayev&#x27;s presidency the main principle of Kazakhstan&#x27;s international relations was multi-vector foreign policy, which was based on initiatives to establish friendly relations with foreign partners. His government&#x27;s policies were considered moderate by maintaining a balance between the world powers of United States and Russia.

From 1990 to 1994, Nazarbayev paid official visits to the United States, United Kingdom, China, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Japan and other nations. By 1996, 120 nations had recognized Kazakhstan, and it had established diplomatic relations with 92 countries. The first major diplomatic initiatives by Nazarbayev were dealing with strategic issues, such as obtaining international security guarantees in the aftermath of nuclear disarmament as a result of pressure from Western nations. Nazarbayev called on Russia, the United States, and China to conclude a non-aggression pact with Kazakhstan that would also guarantee the country&#x27;s sovereignty. On 5 December 1994, Russia, U.S., and U.K. signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances to Kazakhstan based on the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Later, the governments of China and France added their signatures to the Memorandum.

Kazakhstan under Nazarbayev became co-founders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2001.

In January 2019, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa conducted a state visit to Astana to meet with Nazarbayev, in the first visit by an African leader to the country in years. This would be the last foreign head of state that Nazarbayev would receive while in office. Nazarbayev&#x27;s last state visit to a foreign country took place five days prior to his resignation, visiting the United Arab Emirates to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.

==== China ====

Diplomatic relations between Kazakhstan and China were established in January 1992, with Chinese Premier Li Peng visiting the country in April 1994 where he met with Nazarbayev. From there, both nations signed boundary agreement on 26 April and then later during Peng&#x27;s second visit to Almaty, an additional agreement on the border between two countries was signed on 24 September 1997.

In December 2002, during Nazarbayev&#x27;s visit to China, an agreement &quot;On good neighborliness, friendship and cooperation between China and Kazakhstan&quot; and &quot;On cooperation between the two countries to combat terrorism, separatism and extremism&quot; were signed.

In May 2004, a total of ten trade and economic cooperation agreements were signed which included a major Atasu-Alashankou oil pipeline that would connect western Kazakhstan and China with John C. K. Daly from the Jamestown Foundation describing it as &quot;a symbolic link between two of the 21st century&#x27;s rising powers, joining a booming producer with a cash-flush consumer.&quot; A construction of the expansion project was fully completed in 2009.

====Iran====

In a speech given in December 2006 marking the fifteenth anniversary of Kazakhstan&#x27;s independence, Nazarbayev stated he wished to join with Iran in support of a single currency for all Central Asian states and intended to push the idea forward with the President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, on an upcoming visit. In one of his speeches however, Nazarbayev criticised Iran as one of the countries that provides support for terrorism. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry however, released a statement on 19 December, saying his remarks were not &quot;what he really meant,&quot; and his comments were &quot;mistakes.&quot;

During an announcement of a railway link in 2007, Nazarbayev expressed a religious solidarity with Iran, as he was quoted as saying, &quot;Today I will pay a visit to Turkmenistan where we will agree on the construction of a railway through Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to Iran with access to the Persian Gulf. This will bring us closer to our Muslim brothers.&quot;

==== Israel ====

Notwithstanding Kazakhstan&#x27;s membership in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation), under Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan had good relations with Israel. Diplomatic relations were established in 1992 and Nazarbayev paid official visits to Israel in 1995 and 2000. Bilateral trade between the two countries amounted to $724 million in 2005.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conducted his first ever visit to Kazakhstan in mid-December 2016, when he met with Nazarbayev. The two countries signed agreements on research and development, aviation, civil service commissions and agricultural cooperation, as well as a declaration on establishing an agricultural consortium.

==== United States ====
Nazarbayev made his first state visit to the United States on 18–20 May 1992 where he met with U.S. President George H. W. Bush. Both sides have expressed interests to develop friendly, cooperative relations and for both countries to strengthen international peace and stability with an early ratification of the START II treaty. In order to gain investments to Kazakhstan, Nazarbayev, during his visit, signed an agreement with Chevron Corporation which obliged to develop the Tengiz Field that would extract 700,000 barrels of oil per day with a revenue of more than $5 billion a year.

In September 2006, he met with President George W. Bush in the White House where Nazarbayev received praise from Bush for his support during the U.S. led Iraq War and Kazakhstan&#x27;s role as an important oil supplier for the U.S. Nazarbayev proclaimed that &quot;in economics, in energy partnership, in policy, in war on terror, we truly become close partners.&quot;, referring to U.S. support for Kazakhstan&#x27;s independence. He also challenged for Bush and other world leaders to follow the country&#x27;s suit and make their nations nuclear-free.

At the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit held in Seoul, Nazarbayev met with President Barack Obama who remarked Kazakhstan as being &quot;key leader&quot; on the issues of nuclear material elimination and developing international fuel bank. At the meeting, Nazarbayev, as a gift, gave Obama a &quot;tumar,&quot; a traditional Turkic amulet for &quot;good luck&quot; which was eventually used later to jokingly describe the sole reason for Obama&#x27;s win in the 2012 United States presidential election.

In September 2015, during the 70th session of the UN General Assembly, Nazarbayev met with Obama in New York City where both leaders discussed the issues regarding the war in Donbas and the goals of finding peaceful solution based on the Minsk Protocol, as well as nuclear disarmament, fighting extremism, the situation in Afghanistan and combatting ISIS. Nazarbayev thanked the U.S. for its assistance in accessing Kazakhstan into the World Trade Organization. Following months later, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Kazakhstan on 1–3 November 2015, where he offered support for Nazarbayev&#x27;s 100 Concrete Steps programme.

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump lauded Nazabayev&#x27;s leadership and called Kazakhstan&#x27;s achievements under his presidency a &quot;miracle&quot; during their phone call on 30 November 2016. Nazarbayev visited Washington, D.C. in January 2018 where he met Trump at the Oval Office. From there, Trump praised Kazakhstan as &quot;a valued partner in our efforts to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons... and prevent the North Korean regime from threatening the world with nuclear devastation&quot; and noted the country&#x27;s crucial support for U.S. forces in Afghanistan and preventing a safe haven for terrorists.

==== Turkey ====

Earliest official diplomatic contacts were established with Turkey as Kazakhstan was under the Soviet Union. In March 1991, Turkish President Turgut Özal paid a visit to capital Alma-Ata where he met with Nazarbayev as both parties discussed issues related to the establishment and expansion of cooperation in trade, economic, scientific, technical, and cultural spheres. From there, Agreement on Cooperation between the Kazakh SSR and the Republic of Turkey was signed, making it the first international treaty for Kazakhstan. In September of that year, Nazarbayev visited Ankara where a Memorandum of Understanding was signed. 

Following Kazakhstan&#x27;s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union on 16 December 1991, Turkey was among the first countries to recognize the new sovereign Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev paid his first official visit to Ankara in October 1992 to commensurate the opening of the Kazakh embassy in the capital. In spite of relations between two states taking off, Nazarbayev during the First Turkic Speaking States Summit held in Istanbul opposed President Özal&#x27;s initiatives in attempting to unite all Turkic-speaking territories into one nation.

In the aftermath of 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt, Nazarbayev vowed to extradite any persons employed at lyceums who had &quot;links with terrorism&quot; with the Gülen movement by conduct a joint inspection in educational institutions located within Kazakhstan.

Since 1992, trade between Kazakhstan and Turkey amounted to total more than 3 billion dollars yearly, reaching 3.5 billion in its peak in 2012 and remaining stagnant from there. During Nazarbayev&#x27;s meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to Istanbul in September 2018, both leaders announced their willingness to increase tradeover to 5 billion dollars with 10 billion set in long term.

==Post-presidency==

According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, despite his resignation, he is still behind the leadership of the country. His resignation is considered by &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; to be an attempt to turn him into a Lee Kuan Yew type of public figure. In the month since his resignation, he had met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán during their visit to Kazakhstan. Notably, their meetings with Nazarbayev took place separately from their meetings with President Tokayev, who is the &quot;de jure&quot; head of state. Two days after leaving office, he attended the Nauryz celebrations where he was greeted by the civilian population. In regard to accommodations as the first president, it is known that his personal office (now known as &quot;Kökorda&quot;) has been moved to a different location in the capital from the presidential palace. It was also reported in late April 2019 that Nazarbayev also maintains a private jet for official and private visits.

He has embarked on two foreign visits since leaving office, to Beijing and Moscow. The former visit took place during the second Belt and Road Forum while the latter took place during the 2019 Moscow Victory Day Parade. In late-May, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu announced the naming of Nazarbayev as the Honorary President of the Turkic Council. On 7 September, he visited Moscow once again to attend the Moscow City Day celebrations on the VDNKh and to open his pavilion at the trade show. During a visit to the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, he told the hosting President Ilham Aliyev that his father, former President Heydar Aliyev, would be &quot;very delighted&quot; with the development of the capital. In late October, he attended the Enthronement of Japanese emperor Naruhito as the representative of Kazakhstan. During this visit, he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which he congratulated him on his election victory and was invited by Zelensky to visit Kyiv. Nazarbayev met with Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal during his visit to Kazakhstan for a charity tennis match. During his meeting with Nadal, he personally called former Spanish King Juan Carlos I. In October 2019, it was announced that all potential ministerial candidates needed the approval of Nazarbayev before being appointed by Tokayev, with the exception of Minister of Defence, Interior Minister and Foreign Minister.

On 29 November 2019, Nazarbayev was named the Honorary Chair of Central Asian Consultative Meeting. It was announced at the second Consultative Meeting of the Heads of State of Central Asia in Tashkent.

At the 29th Session of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan (QHA) held on 28 April 2021, Nazarbayev announced his intention to step down as the QHA chairman and have President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to succeed his role, describing it as an emotional &quot;serious step&quot;. However from there, Tokayev suggested for Nazarbayev to be named as an &quot;Honorary Chairman&quot; by the QHA to which his statements received applause. Nazarbayev accepted the offer, promising to continue to work with the Assembly.

In October 2021, during a visit to the United Arab Emirates, Nazarbayev awarded Crown Prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan the Nuclear Weapon-Free World and Global Security award for ensuring peace, regional stability and sustainable economic development.

On 23 November 2021, at the Nur Otan political council meeting, it was revealed that Nazarbayev would resign from the party&#x27;s leadership and suggested President Tokayev to take over the position, stressing that the Nur Otan should be led by an incumbent president. The move was met with various reactions from political analysts and activists, affirming that it would increase Tokayev&#x27;s governing powers and influence over the Kazakh politics while some going as far as proclaiming it as an end to the &quot;era of Nazarbayev&quot;. According to Nazarbayev&#x27;s press secretary Aidos Ükıbai, the decision was a &quot;logical continuation of the transit of power&quot; with the party needing to be main support for Tokayev due to &quot;the global crisis caused by the pandemic.&quot;

===Capital renaming===
On 20 March 2019, after Nazarbayev&#x27;s resignation, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev proposed renaming the capital Astana to Nur-Sultan in honor of Nazarbayev. The Parliament of Kazakhstan officially voted in favour of the renaming.

However, Kazakhstan changed the name of the capital from Nur-Sultan back to Astana in September 2022.

===COVID-19===
Nazarbayev created the Biz Birgemiz (lit. &quot;We are Together&quot;) Fund in March 2020 &quot;to fight the pandemic COVID-19 effectively while supporting the economy&quot;. As of June 2020, the fund gathered over 28 billion tenge ($69.3 million) to provide financial aid to more than 470,000 families in 23 cities as part of the fund&#x27;s three waves of assistance. Upon his diagnosis with COVID-19 in mid-June of that year, he received calls and telegrams of support from world leaders, including Vladimir Putin and King Abdullah II of Jordan as well as former President of Croatia Stjepan Mesić.

In June 2021, Nazarbayev received a Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine against the virus. From there, he urged everyone to get vaccinated due to emergence of the new COVID-19 strains for their health, acknowledging the challenging times happening in amidst of the pandemic and wishing health and wellbeing for the public.

===80th birthday===
He recovered from the virus on 3 July 2020, in time for the celebration of his 80th birthday which was held on 6 July and also coincided with the Day of the Capital City. Nazarbayev received congratulations from leader such as the Armenian President Armen Sarkissian, Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Tatar President Mintimer Shaimiev and former Turkish President Abdullah Gül. Former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia Grigory Karasin described Nazarbayev in an interview honoring his birthday as &quot;one of the few world politicians who has a vision of political processes&quot;. The celebratory events were held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. A statue of Nazarbayev in military uniform was unveiled at the National Defense University (an institution that itself which bears his name).

=== 2021 legislative campaign ===

While continuing to lead the Nur Otan after resigning from presidency, Nazarbayev signed a decree in the preparation of the 2021 legislative elections on 4 June 2020 setting the date of closed primaries would be held within the party &quot;for open and political competition, promote civic engagement in the political process, and empower women and the youth of the country&quot; to which he instructed for the party to include 30% of women and 20% of people under the age of 35 in its list. The primaries were held from 17 August to 3 October 2020 where Nazarbayev himself voted online.

At the 20th Nur Otan Extraordinary Congress held on 25 November 2020, the Nur Otan revealed its list of party candidates as well as electoral platforms which were approved by the delegates. Nazarbayev at the congress spoke saying:&quot;The party&#x27;s program announced by our President [Kassym-Jomart Tokayev] today is ambitious and at the same time calculated, supported by financial and human resources. It is a logical extension of our reforms. Throughout the years of independence, I have always set clear goals, and I have said that it is necessary to work hard and hard to achieve them. And now it&#x27;s the same. I support this program proposed by the President and our common task is to rally around it and work together. You have to believe in yourself, love your homeland and do everything possible for progress.&quot;Nazarbayev, at the congress, accused the United States of &quot;double standards&quot; over its conduct of the 2020 presidential elections, telling &quot;what is there to talk about now in the United States of America, the OSCE was not allowed in the elections at all. The Democrats did not allow Republican observers and so on. It is not in order to criticize a big state, but if we are criticized, then why are there such disorders?&quot;. In his response to the Belarusian protests against President Alexander Lukashenko&#x27;s re-election, Nazarbayev criticized the protestors, saying &quot;they&#x27;ve been fucking Belarus for a whole month,&quot; and noted the Bulgarian protests in which Nazarbayev claimed that it received a lack of international attention in contrast with Belarus. To conclude the Nur Otan congress, Nazarbayev proposed Bauyrjan Baibek to be the head of the party&#x27;s campaign headquarters, a decision that was unanimously supported by the Nur Otan delegates.

In the following aftermath of the elections to the Mazhilis which were held on 10 January 2021, the ruling Nur Otan swept a comfortable majority of 76 seats despite a loss eight seats in contrary to the 2016 election. Nazarbayev congratulated the party&#x27;s victory in the election saying, &quot;Kazakhstanis associate the further development of our country, improvement of welfare with our party.&quot;

=== 2022 unrest and resignation from Security Council ===

Following the outbreak of protests after a sudden sharp increase in gas prices, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev declared a state of emergency in Mangystau Region and Almaty, effective from 5 January 2022. The Mamin Cabinet resigned the same day. On the evening of 5 January, Tokayev announced Nazarbayev&#x27;s resignation from the Security Council. Questions regarding Nazarbayev&#x27;s whereabouts arose as he was viewed to be the main target in the unrest with anti-Nazarbayev slogans being chanted throughout protests along with monuments and street names dedicated to him being vandalized and torn down.

Rumours about Nazarbayev fleeing Kazakhstan was brought up by Echo of Moscow chief editor Alexei Venediktov, claiming that he was preparing to leave the country for unspecified treatment citing inner diplomatic circle. The Kyrgyz media reported that a private jet belonging to Nazarbayev&#x27;s family had allegedly arrived in the capital of Bishkek from the United Arab Emirates without official confirmation. While the Kazakh embassy in the UAE denied reports of his presence in the country. Spokesperson Aidos Ükıbai in his Twitter dismissed claims, affirming that Nazarbayev was in the capital of Nur-Sultan and that he had stayed in the country the whole time. From there, Ükıbai stated that Nazarbayev &quot;holds a number of consultative meetings&quot; and is in direct contact with President Tokayev, whom he urged everyone to rally around with &quot;to overcome current challenges and ensure the integrity&quot; of Kazakhstan. 

On 18 January 2022, Nazarbayev made his first public appearance in a video address since the unrest, calling the events a &quot;tragedy&quot; which &quot;became a lesson for all of us.&quot; From there, he urged the public &quot;to protect independence like the apple of one&#x27;s eye&quot; by finding out unknown people responsible for &quot;demonstrations and murders&quot; while expressing condolences to the families of the victims in the protests. During the address, Nazarbayev dismissed any rumours in regard to supposed inner conflict between the country&#x27;s elite by calling them &quot;absolutely groundless&quot;, insisting that he&#x27;d been a pensioner ever since handing over presidency to Tokayev whom he remarked &quot;possesses full power&quot; as he was set to be elected as the new chairman of the ruling Nur Otan party. Nazarbayev remarked about his achievements as president in which his goal was to form &quot;stability and tranquility for the country&quot; by calling for everyone to protect these &quot;enduring values&quot; and for unity around the Tokayev by supporting his reform agenda.

==Personal life==
Nursultan Nazarbayev identifies as a Muslim. As devout, Nazarbayev has described his spirituality as being based on the words from Abai Qunanbaiuly, a Kazakh poet whose philosophy is based on an enlightened Islam. According to Nazarbayev, Abai&#x27;s &quot;Words of Wisdom&quot; aided him in attempting to build a modern Kazakhstan after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Nazarbayev is married to Sara Alpysqyzy Nazarbayeva. They have three daughters: Dariga, Dinara and Aliya. Aliya&#x27;s first marriage was notably to Aidar Akayev, the eldest son of former President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev, which for a short period made the two Central Asian leaders related. Having grown up in the Soviet Union, Nazarbayev is fluent in Kazakh as well as Russian and understands English. He has two brothers, Satybaldy (1947–1980) and Bolat (1953–2023), as well as one sister named Anip. On 16 August 2020, Nazarbayev&#x27;s grandson, Aisultan, reportedly died from cardiac arrest in London. Prior to that, Aisultan made several public statements on social media that Nazarbayev was his biological father and that his life was constantly threatened. He also accused his grandfather&#x27;s associates of plotting and scheming. In response, Nazarbayev described Aisultan as being very similar to himself, expressing his regrets by telling that &quot;one could not have sent him anywhere, but it was impossible to keep him. He was already a slave to this work and could not stop. We treated him in Moscow, and we treated him in London. It seems that I went out and came back to it again.&quot;

On 18 June 2020, it was reported that Nazarbayev had tested positive for COVID-19; a spokesman stated that Nazarbayev would go into isolation and work remotely. On 3 July 2020, Nazarbayev had recovered and was &quot;back on his feet&quot; three weeks after contracting the virus. Nazarbayev later during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin recalled his sickness, telling that &quot;group of Russian doctors stood by me for ten days. It was decisive in my recovery, so it will not be forgotten.&quot;

In an October 2021 interview, Nazarbayev revealed that he had suffered a disease in his spine back in 2011, to which it became noticed while attending a concert, resulting him being carefully escorted out of the hall and eventually undergo a vertebra surgery to which Nazarbayev stated was amongst things that have influenced him in eventually resigning from presidency.

In January 2023, Nursultan Nazarbayev was hospitalized at the National Scientific Cardiac Surgery Center in Astana. On 20 January 2023, a heart operation was performed, which was successful.

He gave his last name to his grandchildren: Aisultan Nazarbayev (1990–2020) and Nabi Nazarbayev (born 2008).

<text>[[Norway]] is a country located in Northern Europe in the northern and western parts of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The majority of the country borders water, including the Skagerrak inlet to the south, the North Sea to the southwest, the North Atlantic Ocean (Norwegian Sea) to the west, and the Barents Sea to the north. It has a land border with Sweden to the east; to the northeast it has a shorter border with Finland and an even shorter border with Russia.

Norway has an elongated shape, one of the longest and most rugged coastlines in the world, and there are a total of 320,249 islands and islets along much-indented coastline, according to Kartverket (the official Norwegian mapping agency). (239,057 islands and 81,192 islets). It is one of the world&#x27;s northernmost countries, and it is one of Europe&#x27;s most mountainous countries, with large areas dominated by the Scandinavian Mountains. The country&#x27;s average elevation is , and 32 percent of the mainland is located above the tree line. Its country-length chain of peaks is geologically continuous with the mountains of Scotland, Ireland, and, after crossing under the Atlantic Ocean, the Appalachian Mountains of North America. Geologists hold that all these formed a single range before the breakup of the ancient supercontinent Pangaea.

During the last glacial period, as well as in many earlier ice ages, virtually the entire country was covered with a thick ice sheet. The movement of the ice carved out deep valleys. As a result of the ice carving, Sognefjorden is the world&#x27;s second deepest fjord and Hornindalsvatnet is the deepest lake in Europe. When the ice melted, the sea filled many of these valleys, creating Norway&#x27;s famous fjords. The glaciers in the higher mountain areas today are not remnants of the large ice sheet of the ice age—their origins are more recent. The regional climate was up to warmer in 7000 BC to 3000 BC in the Holocene climatic optimum, (relative to the 1961-90 period), melting the remaining glaciers in the mountains almost completely during that period.

Even though it has long since been released from the enormous weight of the ice, the land is still rebounding several millimetres a year. This rebound is greatest in the eastern part of the country and in the inner parts of the long fjords, where the ice cover was thickest. This is a slow process, and for thousands of years following the end of the ice age, the sea covered substantial areas of what is today dry land. This old seabed is now among the most productive agricultural lands in the country.

Norway also has maritime claims of for the contiguous zone, for the continental shelf, and for the territorial sea.

==Physical geography==

===Overview===
Mainland Norway comprises an extensive range of natural variation, given its moderate size, including both terrestrial, marine, limnic and snow and ice ecosystems. Norway has a high mineral and bedrock diversity, and high diversity of landforms. Major landscape types include inland hills and mountains, inland valleys, inland plains, coastal plains, coastal fjords and coastal hills and mountains. Glaciated; mostly high plateaus and rugged mountains broken by fertile valleys; small, scattered plains; coastline deeply indented by fjords; arctic tundra only in the extreme northeast (largely found on the Varanger Peninsula). Frozen ground all year can also be found in the higher mountain areas and in the interior of Finnmark county. Numerous glaciers are also found in Norway.

The highest point is Galdhøpiggen at , and the lowest point is the Norwegian Sea at 0m.

===Mainland===

==== Scandinavian Mountains ====
The Scandinavian Mountains are the most defining feature of the country. Starting with Setesdalsheiene north of the Skagerrak coast, the mountains are found in large parts of the country and intersect the many fjords of Vestlandet. This region includes Hardangervidda, Jotunheimen (with Galdhøpiggen at a.s.l.), Sognefjell, and Trollheimen in the north, with large glaciers, such as Jostedalsbreen, Folgefonna, and Hardangerjøkulen. The mountain chain swings eastwards south of Trondheim, with ranges such as Dovrefjell and Rondane, and reaches the border with Sweden, where they have become mostly gently sloping plateaus. The mountains then follow the border in a northeasterly direction and are known as &quot;Kjølen&quot; (the &quot;keel&quot;). The mountains intersect many fjords in Nordland and Troms, where they become more alpine and create many islands after they meet the sea. The Scandinavian mountains form the Lyngen Alps, which reach into northwestern Finnmark, gradually becoming lower from Altafjord towards the North Cape, where they finally end at the Barents Sea.

The Scandinavian Mountains naturally divide the country into physical regions; valleys surround the mountains in all directions.

==== Southern coast ====
In southern Norway, the southern Skagerrak and North Sea coast is the lowland south of the mountain range, from Stavanger in the west to the western reaches of the outer part of the Oslofjord in the east. In this part of the country, valleys tend to follow a north–south direction. This area is mostly hilly, but with some very flat areas such as Lista and Jæren.

==== Southeast ====
The land east of the mountains (corresponding to Østlandet, most of Telemark, and Røros Municipality) is dominated by valleys running in a north–south direction in the eastern part, and in a more northwest–southeast direction further west, the valleys terminating at the Oslofjord. The longest valleys in the country are here—Østerdal and Gudbrandsdal. This region also contains large areas of lowland surrounding the Oslofjord, as well as the Glomma River and Lake Mjøsa.

==== Western fjords ====
The land west of the mountains (corresponding to Vestlandet north of Stavanger) is dominated by the mountain chain, as the mountains extend, gradually becoming lower, all the way to the coast. This region is dominated by large fjords, the largest being Sognefjord and Hardangerfjord. Geirangerfjord is often regarded as having the ultimate in fjord scenery. The coast is protected by a chain of skerries (small, uninhabited islands—the Skjærgård) that are parallel to the coast and provide the beginning of a protected passage for almost the entire route from Stavanger to Nordkapp. In the south, fjords and most valleys generally run in a west–east direction, and, in the north, in a northwest–southeast direction.

==== Trondheim region ====
The land north of Dovre Municipality (corresponding to Trøndelag county, except Røros Municipality) comprises a more gentle landscape with more rounded shapes and mountains, and with valleys terminating at the Trondheimsfjord, where they open up onto a large lowland area. Further north is the valley of Namdalen, opening up in the Namsos area. However, the Fosen peninsula and the most northern coast (Leka Municipality) is dominated by higher mountains and narrower valleys.

==== Northern fjords ====
The land further north in Northern Norway (corresponding to Nordland, Troms, and northwestern Finnmark) is again dominated by steep mountains going all the way to the coast and by numerous fjords. The fjords and valleys generally lie in a west–east direction in the southern part of this area, and a more northwest–southeast direction further north. The Saltfjellet mountain range is an exception, as the valley runs in a more north–south direction from these mountains. This long, narrow area includes many large islands, such as Lofoten, Vesterålen, and Senja.

==== Far northeast ====
The interior and the coast east of Nordkapp (corresponding to Finnmarksvidda and eastern Finnmark) is less dominated by mountains, and is mostly below . The interior is dominated by the large Finnmarksvidda plateau. There are large, wide fjords running in a north–south direction. This coast lacks the small islands, or skerries, typical of the Norwegian coast. Furthest to the east, the Varangerfjord runs in an east–west direction and is the only large fjord in the country whose mouth is to the east.

===Arctic islands===

==== Svalbard ====
Further north, in the Arctic Ocean, lies the Svalbard archipelago, which is also dominated by mountains that are mostly covered by large glaciers, especially in the eastern part of the archipelago, where glaciers cover more than 90%, with one glacier, Austfonna, being the largest in Europe. Unlike on the mainland, these glaciers calve directly into the open ocean.

==== Jan Mayen ====
To the far northwest, halfway towards Greenland, is Jan Mayen island, where the only active volcano in Norway, Beerenberg, is found.

===Antarctic islands and claim to Antarctica===
Norway has several territorial claims in Antarctica and on its islands. Bouvet Island is located in the South Atlantic Ocean at 54°S and mostly covered by glaciers, this island is one of the most remote in the world, inhabited only by seals and birds. Peter I Island is located in the South Pacific Ocean at 69°S and 90°W, this island is dominated by glaciers and a volcano. As with Bouvet Island, this island is regarded as an external dependency, and not part of the kingdom. Queen Maud Land is Norway&#x27;s continental claim in Antarctica. The large, sectorial area stretches to the South Pole and is completely dominated by the world&#x27;s largest ice sheet and with some nunataks (bare rock) penetrating above the ice. The Troll Research Station is operated by the Norwegian Polar Institute and is located on a snow-free mountain slope, the only station in Antarctica not to be located on the ice.

==Climate==

The climate of Norway is relatively temperate. This is mainly due to the North Atlantic Current with its extension, the Norwegian Current, raising the air temperature; the prevailing southwesterlies bringing mild air onshore; and the general southwest–northeast orientation of the coast, which allows the westerlies to penetrate into the Arctic. 

=== Precipitation ===
Norway is among Europe&#x27;s wettest countries, but with large variation in precipitation amount due to the terrain with mountain chains resulting in orographic precipitation but also creating rain shadows. In some regions, locations with vastly different precipitation amounts can be fairly close. Precipitation is heaviest in late autumn and winter along the coast, while April to June is the driest. The innermost parts of the long fjords are somewhat drier. The regions east of the mountain chain (including Oslo) have a more continental climate with generally less precipitation, and precipitation peaks in summer and early autumn, while winter and spring tend to be driest. A large area in the interior of Finnmark receive less than of precipitation annually. Some valleys surrounded by mountains get very scarce precipitation, and often need irrigation in summer.

===Temperature===
The coast experiences milder winters than other areas at the same latitudes. The average temperature difference between the coldest month and the warmest is only in coastal areas. The differences of inland areas are larger, with a maximum difference of in Karasjok.

Bø Municipality is the most northerly location in the world where all winter months have mean temperatures above . Temperature differences between the north and south are greatest in the spring; this is also the time of year when daytime and nighttime temperatures differ the most. Inland valleys and the innermost fjord areas have less wind and see the warmest summer days. Inland areas reach their peak warmth around mid-July and coastal areas by the first half of August. Humidity is usually low in summer.

The North Atlantic Current splits in two over the northern part of the Norwegian Sea, one branch going east into the Barents Sea and the other going north along the west coast of Spitsbergen. This modifies the Arctic polar climate somewhat and results in open water throughout the year at higher latitudes than any other place in the Arctic. On the eastern coast of the Svalbard archipelago, the sea used to be frozen during most of the year, but warming has led to open waters lasting noticeably longer. Atlantic lows bringing mild winds in winter further warmed by foehn can give warm temperatures in narrow fjords in winter, Compared to coastal areas, inland valleys and the innermost fjord areas have larger diurnal temperature variations, especially in spring and summer.
All populated areas of the Norwegian mainland have temperate or subarctic climates (Köppen groups &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;). Svalbard and Jan Mayen have a polar climate (Köppen group &quot;E&quot;). As a consequence of warming since 1990, summers are warmer and longer and winters are getting shorter and milder. With the new official 1991-2020 climate normal, many areas have seen their climate change to a new climate zone compared to 1961-90 normal. Snow cover has also decreased in most populated areas due to winter warming. The strongest warming has been observed on Svalbard. In addition to warming, precipitation has increased in most areas, especially in winter, increasing erosion and the risk of landslides.
=== Hazards and natural disasters ===
European windstorms with hurricane-strength winds along the coast and in the mountains are not uncommon. Avalanches on steep slopes, especially in the northern part of the country and in mountain areas. Landslides have been fatal, mostly in areas with soil rich in marine clay, as in lowland areas near Trondheimsfjord. Tsunamis have killed people; usually caused by parts of mountains (rockslide) falling into fjords or lakes. This happened 1905 in Loen in Stryn Municipality when parts of Ramnefjell fell into Loenvatnet lake, causing a tsunami which killed 61 people. It happened again in the same place in 1936, this time with 73 victims. 40 people were killed in Tafjord in Norddal Municipality in 1934.

==Fauna==
Due to the large latitudinal range of the country and its varied topography and climate, Norway has a higher number of habitats than almost any other European country. There are approximately 60,000 species of plant and animal life in Norway and adjacent waters. The Norwegian Shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive. The total number of species include 16,000 species of insects (probably 4,000 more species yet to be described), 20,000 species of algae, 1,800 species of lichen, 1,050 species of mosses, 2,800 species of vascular plants, up to 7,000 species of fungi, 450 species of birds (250 species nesting in Norway), 90 species of mammals, 45 species of freshwater fish, 150 species of saltwater fish, 1,000 species of freshwater invertebrates and 3,500 species of saltwater invertebrates. About 40,000 of these species have been scientifically described. In the summer of 2010, scientific exploration in Finnmark discovered 126 species of insects new to Norway, of which 54 species were new to science.

The 2006 IUCN Red List names 3,886 Norwegian species as endangered, 17 of which, such as the European beaver, are listed because they are endangered globally, even if the population in Norway is not seen as endangered. There are 430 species of fungi on the red list, many of these are closely associated with the small remaining areas of old-growth forests. There are also 90 species of birds on the list and 25 species of mammals. As of 2006, 1,988 current species are listed as endangered or vulnerable, of which 939 are listed as vulnerable, 734 as endangered, and 285 as critically endangered in Norway, among them the gray wolf, the Arctic fox (healthy population on Svalbard), and the pool frog.

The largest predator in Norwegian waters is the sperm whale, and the largest fish is the basking shark. The largest predator on land is the polar bear, while the brown bear is the largest predator on the Norwegian mainland, where the common moose is the largest animal.

==Flora==
Natural vegetation in Norway varies considerably, as can be expected in a country with such variation in latitude. There are generally fewer species of trees in Norway than in areas in western North America with a similar climate. This is because European north–south migration routes after the ice age are more difficult, with bodies of water (such as the Baltic Sea and the North Sea) and mountains creating barriers, while in America land is contiguous and the mountains follow a north–south direction. Recent research using DNA-studies of spruce and pine and lake sediments have proven that Norwegian conifers survived the ice age in ice-free refuges to the north as far as Andøya. 

Many imported plants have been able to bear seed and spread. Less than half of the 2,630 plant species in modern Norway are native species. About 210 species of plants growing in Norway are listed as endangered, 13 of which are endemic. The national parks in Norway are mostly located in mountain areas; about 2% of the productive forests in the country are protected.

Some plants, such as holly and bell heather, are classified as western due to their need for high humidity or low tolerance of winter frost; these will stay close to the southwestern coast, with their northern limit near Ålesund. Plants classified as eastern need comparatively more summer sunshine, with less humidity, but can tolerate cold winters. These will often occur in the southeast and inland areas: examples being &quot;Daphne mezereum&quot;, &quot;Fragaria viridis&quot;, and spiked speedwell. Some eastern species common to Siberia grow in the river valleys of eastern Finnmark. There are species which seem to thrive in between these extremes, such as the southern plants, where both winter and summer climate is important (such as pedunculate oak, European ash, and dog&#x27;s mercury). Other plants depend on the type of bedrock.

Mild temperatures along the coast allow for some hardy species of palm grow as far north as Sunnmøre. One of the largest remaining Linden forests in Europe grows at Flostranda, in Stryn Municipality. Planted deciduous trees, such as horse chestnut and beech, thrive north of the Arctic Circle (as at Steigen Municipality).

There is a considerable number of alpine species in the mountains of Norway. These species cannot tolerate summers that are comparatively long and warm, nor are they able to compete with plants adapted to a longer and warmer growing season. Many alpine plants are common in the North Boreal zone and some in the Middle Boreal zone, but their main area of distribution is on the alpine tundra in the Scandinavian Mountains and on the Arctic tundra. Many of the hardiest species have adapted by ripening seeds over more than one summer. Examples of alpine species are glacier buttercup, &quot;Draba lactea&quot;, and &quot;Salix herbacea&quot;. A well-known anomaly is the 30 American alpine species, which in Europe only grow in two mountainous parts of Norway: the Dovre–Trollheimen and Jotunheim mountains in the south; and the Saltdal Municipality, to western Finnmark, in the north. Other than in Norway, these species—such as &quot;Braya linearis&quot; and &quot;Carex scirpoidea&quot;—grow only in Canada and Greenland. It is unknown whether these survived the ice age on some mountain peak penetrating the ice, or spread from further south in Europe, or why did they not spread to other mountainous regions of Europe. Some alpine species have a wider distribution and grow in Siberia, such as &quot;Rhododendron lapponicum&quot; (Lapland rosebay). Other alpine species are common to the whole Arctic and some grow only in Europe, such as globe-flower.

===Nemoral===
A small area along the southern coast—from Soknedal Municipality in southern Rogaland and east to Fevik in Agder county (including Kristiansand)—belongs to the Nemoral vegetation zone. This zone is located below above sea level and at most inland along the valleys. This is the predominant vegetation zone in Europe north of southern France, the Alps, the Carpathians, and the Caucasus. The hallmark of this zone in Norway is the predominance of oak and the virtually complete lack of typical boreal species such as Norway spruce and grey alder, although a lowland variant of pine occurs. Nemoral covers a total of 0.5% of the land area (excluding Svalbard and Jan Mayen).

===Hemiboreal (Boreonemoral)===
The hemiboreal zone covers a total of 7% of the land area in Norway, including 80% of Østfold and Vestfold. This vegetation represents a mix of nemoral and boreal plant species, and belongs to the Palearctic, Sarmatic mixed forests terrestrial ecoregion (PA0436). The nemoral species tend to predominate on slopes facing southwest and with good soil, while the boreal species predominate on slopes facing north and with waterlogged soil. In some areas, other factors overrule this, such as where the bedrock gives little nutrient, where oak and the boreal pine often share predominance. The boreonemoral zone follows the coast from Oslofjord north to Ålesund, becoming discontinuous north of Sunnmøre. In Oslo, this zone reaches to an elevation of above sea level. It also reaches into some of the lower valleys and just reaches the lowland around Mjøsa, but not as far north as Lillehammer. In the valleys of the south, this vegetation might exist up to above sea level. The zone follows the lowland of the west coast and into the largest fjords, reaching an elevation of there, even to in some sheltered fjords and valleys in Nordmøre, with nutrient-rich soil. The northernmost locations in the world are several areas along the Trondheimsfjord, such as Frosta Municipality, with the northernmost location being Byahalla, in Steinkjer Municipality. Some nemoral species in this zone are English oak, sessile oak, European ash, elm, Norway maple, hazel, black alder, lime, yew, holly (southwest coast), wild cherry, ramsons, beech (a late arrival only common in Vestfold), and primrose. Typical boreal species are Norway spruce, pine, downy birch, grey alder, aspen, rowan, wood anemone, and &quot;Viola riviniana&quot;.

===Boreal===
Boreal species are adapted to a long and cold winter, and most of these species can tolerate colder winter temperatures than winters in most of Norway. Thus they are distinguished by their need for growing season length and summer warmth. Bogs are common in the boreal zone, with the largest areas in the North and Middle Boreal Zones, as well as in the area just above the tree line. The large boreal zone is usually divided into three subzones: South Boreal, Middle Boreal, and North Boreal.

The boreal zones in Norway belong to three ecoregions. The area dominated by spruce forests (some birch, pine, willow, aspen) mostly belong to the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion (PA0608). The Scandinavian coastal conifer forests ecoregion (PA0520) in coastal areas with mild winters and frequent rainfall follows the coast from south of Stavanger north to southern Troms and includes both hemiboreal and boreal areas. Bordering the latter region is the Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands ecoregion (PA1110). This region seems to include both mountain areas with alpine tundra and lowland forests, essentially all the area outside the natural range of Norway spruce forests. This ecoregion thus shows a very large range of climatic and environmental conditions, from the temperate forest along the fjords of Western Norway to the summit of Galdhøpiggen, and northeast to the Varanger Peninsula. The area above the conifer treeline is made up of mountain birch &quot;Betula pubescens-czerepanovii&quot; (&quot;fjellbjørkeskog&quot;). The Scots pine reaches its altitudinal limit about lower than the mountain birch.

====South Boreal====
The South Boreal zone (SB) is dominated by boreal species, especially Norway spruce, and covers a total of 12% of the total land area. The SB is the only boreal zone with a few scattered—but well-developed—warmth-demanding broadleaf deciduous trees, such as European ash and oak. Several species in this zone need fairly warm summers (SB has 3–4 months with a mean 24-hr temperature of at least ), and thus are very rare in the middle boreal zone. Some of the species not found further north are black alder, hop, oregano, and guelder rose. This zone is found above the hemiboreal zone, up to amsl in Østlandet and in the most southern valleys. In the eastern valleys it reaches several hundred kilometers into Gudbrandsdal and Østerdal, and up to Lom Municipality and Skjåk Municipality, in Ottadalen. Along the southwestern coast, the zone reaches an elevation of at the head of large fjords (such as in Lærdal), and about nearer to the coast. Norway spruce is lacking in Vestlandet (Voss Municipality is an exception). North of Ålesund, SB vegetation predominates in the lowland down to sea level, including islands such as Hitra. Most of the lowland in Trøndelag below elevation is SB, up to above sea level in inland valleys such as Gauldalen and Verdalen, and up to in Namdalen. The coastal areas and some fjord areas further north—such as Nærøysund Municipality and Brønnøy Municipality, and the best locations along the Helgeland coast—is SB north to the mouth of Ranfjord, while inland areas north of Grong Municipality are dominated by Middle Boreal zone vegetation in the lowland. There are small isolated areas with SB vegetation further north, as in Bodø Municipality and Fauske Municipality, the most northern location being a narrow strip along the northern shore of Ofotfjord; and the endemic Nordland-whitebeam only grows in Bindal Municipality. Agriculture in Norway, including grain cultivation, takes place mostly in the hemiboreal and SB zones.

====Middle Boreal====
The typical closed-canopy forest of the Middle Boreal (MB) zone is dominated by boreal plant species. The MB vegetation covers a total of 20% of the total land area. Norway spruce is the dominant tree in large areas in the interior of Østlandet, Sørlandet, Trøndelag, and Helgeland and the MB and SB spruce forests are the commercially most important in Norway. Spruce does not grow naturally north of Saltfjell in mid-Nordland (the Siberian spruce variant occurs in the Pasvik valley), due to mountain ranges blocking their advance, but is often planted in MB areas further north for economic reasons, contributing to a different landscape. Birch is usually dominant in these northern areas; but pine, aspen, rowan, bird cherry and grey alder are also common. This MB birch is often a cross between silver birch and downy birch and is taller () than the birch growing near the tree line. Conifers will grow taller. Some alpine plants grow in the MB zone; nemoral species are rare. The understory (undergrowth) is usually well developed if the forest is not too dense. Many plants do not grow further north: grey alder, silver birch, yellow bedstraw, raspberry, mugwort, and &quot;Myrica gale&quot; are examples of species in this zone that do not grow further north or higher up. MB is located at an altitude of in Østlandet, up to in the southern valleys, ( at the head of the long fjords) on the southwest coast, and in Trøndelag ( in the interior, as at Røros and Oppdal Municipality). Further north, MB is common in the lowland: up to above sea level in Lofoten and Vesterålen, at Narvik, at Tromsø, in inland valleys in Troms, and the lowland at the head of Altafjord is the most northerly area of any size—small pockets exist at Porsanger Municipality and Sør-Varanger Municipality. This is usually the most northerly area with some farming activity, and barley was traditionally grown even as far north as Alta Municipality.

====North Boreal====

The North Boreal (NB) zone, (also known as open or sparse taiga) is the zone closest to the tree line, bordering the alpine or polar area, and dominated by a harsh subarctic climate. There are at least 30 summer days with a mean temperature of or more, up to about two months. The trees grow very slowly and generally do not get very large. The forest is not as dense as further south or at lower altitudes and is known as the mountain forest (&quot;Fjellskog&quot;). The NB zone covers a total of 28% of the total land area of Norway, including almost half of Finnmark, where the mountain birch grows down to sea level. The lower part of this zone also has conifers, but the tree line in Norway is mostly formed by mountain birch, a subspecies of downy birch (subspecies &quot;czerepanovii&quot;), which is not to be confused with dwarf birch). Spruce and pine make up the tree line in some mountain areas with a more continental climate. Alpine plants are common in this zone. The birch forest above sea level at Sikilsdalshorn is the highest tree line in Norway, while a birch at 1,404 m ASL in Veodal, Jotunheimen, is the highest growing single tree. The tree line is lower closer to the coast and in areas with lower mountains, due to cooler summers, more wind near mountain summits, and more snow in the winter (coastal mountains) leading to later snowmelt. The NB zone covers large areas at altitude in the interior of Østlandet; is in the central mountain areas; but at the western coast the tree line is down to about above sea level, increasing significantly in the long fjords ( at the head of Sognefjord). Further north, large areas in the interior highlands or uplands of Trøndelag and North Norway are dominated by the NB zone, with the tree line at about amsl in the interior of Trøndelag, in Rana Municipality, at Narvik, at Tromsø, at Kirkenes and at Hammerfest (only pockets in sheltered areas). The large Finnmarksvidda plateau is at an altitude placing it almost exactly at the tree line. The last patch of NB zone gives way to tundra at sea level about south of the North Cape plateau (near Skarsvåg). Areas south of this line are tundra-like with scattered patches of mountain birch woodland (forest tundra) and become alpine tundra even at minor elevations. The trees near the tree line are often bent by snow, wind, and growing-season frost; and their height is only . Outside Norway (and adjacent areas in Sweden), the only other areas in the world with the tree line mostly made up by a small-leaved deciduous tree such as birch—in contrast to conifers—are Iceland and the Kamtschatka peninsula.

The presence of a conifer tree line is sometimes used (&quot;Barskoggrense&quot;) to divide this zone into two subzones, as the conifers will usually not grow as high up as the mountain birch. Spruce and pine grow at nearly above sea level in some areas of Jotunheimen, down to in Bergen ( at the head of Sognefjord), at Lillehammer (mountains near Oslo are too low to have a tree line), at Trondheim ( at Oppdal), at Narvik, at Harstad, at Alta; and the most northerly pine forest in the world is in Stabbursdalen National Park in Porsanger Municipality. There are some forests in this part of the NB zone; and some conifers can grow quite large even if growth is slow.

===Tundra===
Alpine tundra is common in Norway, covering a total of 32% of the land area (excluding Svalbard and Jan Mayen) and belonging to the Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands ecoregion (PA1110). The area closest to the tree line (low alpine) has continuous plant cover, with willow species such as &quot;Salix glauca&quot;, &quot;S. lanata&quot;, and &quot;S. lapponum&quot; ( tall); blueberry, common juniper, and twinflower are also common. The low alpine area was traditionally used as summer pasture, and in part still is. This zone reaches an elevation of in Jotunheimen, including most of Hardangervidda; in eastern Trollheimen; and about at Narvik and the Lyngen Alps. Higher up (mid-alpine tundra) the plants become smaller; mosses and lichens are more predominant; and plants still cover most of the ground, even if snowfields lasting into mid-summer and permafrost are common. At the highest elevations (high-alpine tundra) the ground is dominated by bare rock, snow, and glaciers, with few plants.


The highest weather station in Norway—Fanaråken in Luster Municipality, at —has barely three months of above freezing temperatures and a July average of . Still, glacier buttercup has been found only below the summit of Galdhøpiggen, and mosses and lichens have been found at the summit.

In northeastern Finnmark (northern half of the Varanger Peninsula and the Nordkinn Peninsula) is a small lowland tundra area which is often considered part of the Kola Peninsula tundra ecoregion (PA1106). Svalbard and Jan Mayen have tundra vegetation except for areas covered by glaciers; and some areas, such as the cliffs at southern Bear Island, are fertilized by seabird colonies. This tundra is often considered part of the Arctic Desert ecoregion (PA1101). The lushest areas on these Arctic islands are sheltered fjord areas at Spitsbergen; they have the highest summer temperatures and the very dry climate makes for little snow and thus comparatively early snowmelt. The short growing season and the permafrost underneath the active layer provide enough moisture. Plants include dwarf birch, cloudberry, Svalbard poppy, and harebell.

A warmer climate would push the vegetation zones significantly northwards and to higher elevations.

==Natural resources==

In addition to oil and natural gas, hydroelectric power, and fish and forest resources, Norway has reserves of ferric and nonferric metal ores. Many of these have been exploited in the past but whose mines are now idle because of low-grade purity and high operating costs. Europe&#x27;s largest titanium deposits are near the southwest coast. Coal is mined in the Svalbard islands.

Norway&#x27;s resources include petroleum, copper, natural gas, pyrites, nickel, iron ore, zinc, lead, fish, lumber, and hydropower.

==Land use==

3.3% of Norway&#x27;s land is considered arable land, with 0% of it used for permanent crops and permanent pastures. A 1993 estimate assessed Norway&#x27;s irrigated land at about . 38% of land area is covered by forests; 21% by conifer forest, and 17% by deciduous forest. The remaining land is made of mountains and heaths (46%), bogs and wetlands (6.3%), lakes and rivers (5.3%), and urban areas (1.1%). Over time, wilderness areas have decreased due to human intervention. In 2008, Environment Norway () referred changing land use as one of the most important factors for endangered species and declining biodiversity.

==Environmental concerns==

Environmental concerns in Norway include how to cut greenhouse gas emissions, pollution of the air and water, loss of habitat, damage to cold-water coral reefs from trawlers, and salmon fish farming threatening the wild salmon by spawning in the rivers, thereby diluting the fish DNA. Acid rain has damaged lakes, rivers and forests, especially in the southernmost part of the country, and most wild salmon populations in Sørlandet have died. Due to lower emissions in Europe, acid rain in Norway has decreased by 40% from 1980 to 2003. Another concern is a possible increase in extreme weather. In the future, climate models predict increased precipitation, especially in the areas with currently high precipitation, and also predict more episodes with heavy precipitation within a short period, which can cause landslides and local floods. Winters will probably be significant milder, and the sea-ice cover in the Arctic Ocean might melt altogether in summer, threatening the survival of the polar bear on Svalbard. Both terrestrial and aquatic species are expected to shift northwards, and this is already observed for some species; the growing red deer population is spreading northwards and eastwards, with 2008 being the first hunting season which saw more red deer (35,700) than moose shot. Migratory birds are arriving earlier; trees are coming into leaf earlier; mackerel are becoming common in summer off the coast of Troms. The total number of species in Norway are expected to rise due to new species arriving. Norwegians are statistically among the most worried when it comes to global warming and its effects, even if Norway is among the countries expected to be least negatively affected by global warming, with some possible gains.

<text>Demographic features of the population of Norway, including Jan Mayen, and Svalbard, where the hospital is not equipped for births, and no burials are allowed because of permafrost, include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects.
The population of Norway was around 5.5 million in 2023.

==Historical populations==

From 1349 to 1500 the population was approximately halved by several rounds of the black plague, down to approximately 250,000.

The first official census for the then Denmark-Norway kingdom union was held in 1769 and found the Norwegian population to be 723 000.

Except for Ireland, no other country contributed a larger percentage of its population to the American immigration between 1825 - 1925 when more than 800,000 left Norway.

By 1905, when Norway reached full independence, the population was 2,303,595.

==Population==

The total population of Norway on 1 July 2023 was 5,514,042. Statistics Norway estimated that the 5,000,000 milestone was reached on 19 March 2012.

The following demographic statistics are from the World Population Review.
* One birth every 8 minutes
* One death every 13 minutes
* One net migrant every 19 minutes
* Net gain of one person every 10 minutes



===Fertility===

The total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period. Sources: Our World In Data and Gapminder Foundation.

===Current vital statistics===


===Structure of the population===



== Ethnicity ==

Statistics Norway does not attempt to quantify or track data on ethnicity. The national population registry records only country of birth.

As of 2012, an official government study shows that 81.0% of the total population were ethnic Norwegians (born in Norway with two parents also born in Norway).

Ethnically, the residents of Norway are predominantly Norwegians, a North Germanic ethnic group. In Northern Norway there is a population of Sámi people, who descend from people who probably settled the area a couple thousand years ago. The people who spoke the proto-Sámi language probably migrated from the Volga region in modern-day Russia in Eastern Europe through Finland, finally arriving in the northern portion of the Scandinavian peninsula where they would assimilate local Paleo-European hunter-gatherers who were already living in the region. The indigenous peoples and minorities of Norway include: Sámi, Scandinavian Romani, Roma, Jews, and Kvener, as well as a small Finnish community.

== Immigration ==
===Net migration of Norway, 1999-present===


In the last decades, Norway has become home to increasing numbers of immigrants, foreign workers, and asylum-seekers from various parts of the world. Norway had a steady influx of immigrants from South Asia (mostly Pakistanis and Sri Lankans), East Asia (mainly Chinese), Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia (e.g. Filipinos), Eastern Europe (e.g. Russians) and Central Europe (e.g. Poles), Southern Europe (Greeks, Albanians and people from former Yugoslavia, Bosniaks, Serbs etc.), and Middle East countries (especially Kurdish Iraqis and Kurdish Iranians), as well as Somalis, Turks, Moroccans, and some Latin Americans. After ten Eastern European and Baltic countries joined the EU in 2004, there has also been a substantial influx of people from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

At the start of 2022, there were 819,356 immigrants and 205,819 Norwegian-born to immigrant parents in Norway, together constituting 18.9% of the total population. The same year, immigrants (and Norwegian born to immigrant parents) originating in the European Economic Area constituted 7.1% of the total number of Norwegian residents, while 6.3% were from Asia including Turkey and 2.7% were from Africa.

Among people of African descent in Oslo, almost 60% are younger than 30, compared to 20% of those of North American background.

As of 2022, there are around 207,575 third generation immigrants in Norway. This means that at least one of their grandparents were born in a foreign country. The majority of these persons are of Western European and Northern European background with Sweden and Denmark accounting for 36,126 (17.4%) and 33,695 (16.2%) respectively. Other countries with significant third generation communities are the United States with 29,395 (14.1%), the United Kingdom with 17,882 (8.6%), Germany with 14,090 (6.8%), Finland with 6,213 (3%) and South Korea with 5,199 (2,5%).

Of these 1,025,175 immigrants and their descendants (born in Norway with two foreign born parents):
* 419,720 (41%) have a Western background (UK, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Canada and the EU)
* 88,192 (9%) have a different European background (e.g. Russia, Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Switzerland are included here)
* 29,515 (3%) have a background from Latin America and the Caribbean
* 144,868 (14%) have an African background
* 342,571 (33%) have an Asian background, including Turkey

In 2012, of the total 660 000 with immigrant background, 407,262 had Norwegian citizenship (62.2 percent).
Immigrants were represented in all Norwegian municipalities.
The cities or municipalities with the highest share of immigrants in 2012 was Oslo (26 percent) and Drammen (18 percent). The share in Stavanger was 16%. According to Reuters, Oslo is the &quot;fastest growing city in Europe because of increased immigration&quot;. In recent years, immigration has accounted for most of Norway&#x27;s population growth.


== Employment and income ==
;Unemployment, youth ages 15–24:
:total: 10.4%. Country comparison to the world: 125th
:male: 11.7%
:female: 9% (2017 est.)

==Religion==
The Lutheran Church of Norway is the former state church and the vast majority remain at least nominal members. Other religions do, however, enjoy religious freedom and have prospered with immigration in recent years, particularly Islam and Roman Catholicism. Saint Olaf is the patron saint of Norway. He is regarded by some as the eternal king and has a reputation and place in history unchallenged by any other Norwegian King for the last 1000 years.

==Languages==

Norwegian (the written standards Bokmål and Nynorsk). &lt;br&gt;Uralic languages – South Sámi, Lule Sámi, North Sámi and Kven – are additional official languages of some municipalities.

<text>The politics of Norway take place in the framework of a parliamentary, representative democratic constitutional monarchy. Executive power is exercised by the Council of State, the cabinet, led by the prime minister of Norway. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the legislature, the Storting, elected within a multi-party system. The judiciary is independent of the executive branch and the legislature.

 According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Norway was 2023 the second most electoral democratic country in the world. Reporters Without Borders ranked Norway 1st in the world in the 2019 Press Freedom Index. Freedom House&#x27;s 2020 Freedom in the World report classified Norway as &quot;free&quot;, scoring maximum points in the categories of &quot;political rights&quot; and &quot;civil liberties&quot;.

==Constitutional development==
The Norwegian constitution, signed by the Eidsvoll assembly on 17 May 1814, transformed Norway from being an absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. The 1814 constitution granted rights such as freedom of speech (§100) and rule of law (§§ 96, 97, 99). Important amendments include:

*4 November 1814: Constitution reenacted in order to form a personal union with the king of Sweden
*1851: Constitutional prohibition against admission of Jews lifted (see &quot;Jew clause&quot;)
*1884: Parliamentarism has evolved since 1884 and entails that the cabinet must not have the parliament against it (an absence of mistrust, but an express of support is not necessary), and that the appointment by the King is a formality when there is a clear parliamentary majority. This parliamentary rule has the status of constitutional custom. All new laws are passed and all new governments are therefore formed &quot;de jure&quot; by the King, although not &quot;de facto&quot;. After elections resulting in no clear majority, the King appoints the new government de facto
*1887: Prohibition against monastic orders lifted
*1898: Universal male suffrage established
*1905: Union with Sweden dissolved
*1913: Universal suffrage established 
*1956: Religious freedom formalised and prohibition against Jesuits lifted (see &quot;Jesuit clause&quot;)
*2004: New provision on freedom of expression, replacing the old § 100
* 2007: Removed the old system of division of Stortinget into the Odelsting and Lagting (took effect after the 2009 general election). Changes to the Court of Impeachment. Parliamentary system now part of the Constitution (previously this was only a constitutional custom) (new § 15)

==Executive branch==

Norway is a constitutional monarchy, where the king has a mainly symbolic power. The royal house is a branch of the princely family of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, and the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in Germany. The functions of the king, Harald V, are mainly ceremonial, but he has influence as the symbol of national unity. Although the constitution of 1814 grants important executive powers to the king, these are always exercised by the Council of State in the name of the king (King&#x27;s Council, or cabinet). The king is also High Protector of the Church of Norway (the state church), Grand Master of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav, and symbolically Supreme Commander of the Norwegian armed forces.

The Council of State is formally convened by the reigning monarch. The Council of State consists of the prime minister and his or her council, formally appointed by the king. Parliamentarism has evolved since 1884 and entails that the cabinet must not have the parliament against it, and that the appointment by the king is a formality. The council must have the confidence of the Norwegian legislative body, known as the Storting. In practice, the monarch will ask the leader of a parliamentary block that has a majority in the Storting to form a government. After elections resulting in no clear majority to any party or coalition, the leader of the party most likely to be able to form a government is appointed prime minister. Since World War II, most non-socialist governments have been coalitions, and Labour Party governments have often relied on the support of other parties to retain the necessary parliamentary votes.

The executive branch is divided into the following ministries:
* Office of the Prime Minister ()
* Ministry of Agriculture and Food ()
* Ministry of Children and Equality ()
* Ministry of Culture ()
* Ministry of Defence ()
* Ministry of Education and Research ()
* Ministry of the Environment ()
* Ministry of Finance ()
* Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs ()
* Ministry of Foreign Affairs ()
* Ministry of Government Administration and Reform ()
* Ministry of Health and Care Services ()
* Ministry of Justice and the Police ()
* Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion ()
* Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development ()
* Ministry of Petroleum and Energy ()
* Ministry of Trade and Industry ()
* Ministry of Transport and Communications ()

=== Governments 1935–1981 ===

The Labour Party has been the largest party in Parliament ever since the election of 1927 up to the recent 2017 election. Labour formed their first brief minority government in 1928 which lasted for 18 days only. After the 1936 election the Labour Party formed a new minority government, which had to go into exile 1940–1945 because of the German occupation of Norway. After a brief trans-party government following the German capitulation in 1945, Labour gained a majority of the seats in parliament in the first post-war election of 1945.

Norway was ruled by Labour governments from 1945 to 1981, except for three periods (1963, 1965–1971, and 1972–1973). The Labour Party had a single party majority in the Storting from 1945 to 1961. Since then no party has single-handedly formed a majority government, hence minority and coalition governments have been the rule. After the centre-right Willoch government lost its parliamentary majority in the election of 1985, there were no majority governments in Norway until the second Stoltenberg government was formed after the 2005 election.

=== Governments 1981–2005 ===

From 1981 to 1997, governments alternated between minority Labour governments and Conservative-led centre-right governments. The centre-right governments gained power in three out of four elections during this period (1981, 1985, 1989), whereas Labour toppled those governments twice between elections (1986, 1990) and stayed in power after one election (1993). Elections take place in September and governments change in October of election years.

Conservative leader Kåre Willoch formed a minority government after the election of 1981. In 1983, midway between elections, this government was expanded to a majority three-party coalition of the Conservatives, the Centre Party and the Christian Democrats. In the election of 1985 the coalition lost its majority but stayed in office until 1986, when it stepped down after losing a parliamentary vote on petrol taxes.

Labour leader Gro Harlem Brundtland served three periods as Prime Minister. First briefly from February 1981 until the election the same year, then from May 1986 to the election of 1989, and last from November 1990 until October 1996 when she decided to step out of domestic politics. Brundtland strongly influenced Norwegian politics and society during this period and was nicknamed the &quot;national mother&quot;.

After the election of 1989 a centre-right coalition was formed with the same three parties as in 1983–1986, this time headed by Conservative leader Jan P. Syse. This coalition governed from 1989 to November 1990 when it collapsed from inside over the issue of Norwegian membership in the European Economic Area.
When Brundtland resigned in 1996, Labour leader Thorbjørn Jagland formed a new Labour government that stayed in office until October 1997 when he, after the September 1997 election, declared that his government would step down because the Labour Party failed to win at least 36.9% of the national vote – the percentage Labour had won in the 1993 election.

A three-party minority coalition of the Centre, Christian Democratic, and Liberal parties, headed by Christian Democrat Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, moved into office in October 1997. That government fell in March 2000 over the issue of proposed natural gas plants, opposed by Bondevik due to their impact on climate change.

The Labour Party&#x27;s Jens Stoltenberg, a Brundtland protégé, took over in a minority Labour government but lost power in the September 2001 election when Labour posted its worst performance since World War I.

Bondevik once again became Prime Minister in 2001, this time as head of a minority coalition of the Conservatives, Christian Democrats and Liberals, a coalition dependent on support from the Progress Party. This coalition government was the first to stay in office for a complete four-year election period since Per Borten&#x27;s coalition government of 1965–1969.

===Cabinet 2005–2013===
A coalition between the Labour Party, Socialist Left Party, and Centre Party, took over after the 2005 general election, where this coalition obtained a majority of 87 out of 169 seats in the Storting. Jens Stoltenberg became Prime Minister and formed a cabinet known as Stoltenberg&#x27;s Second Cabinet.

This was a historical coalition in several aspects. It was the first time the Socialist Left sat in cabinet, the first time the Labour Party sat in a coalition government since the 1945 four-month post-war trans-party government (otherwise in government alone), and the first time the Centre Party sat in government along with socialist parties (otherwise in coalition with conservative and other centre parties).

In the 2009 general election the coalition parties kept the majority in the Storting by winning 86 out of 169 seats. Stoltenberg&#x27;s second cabinet thus continued. There have been several reshuffles in the cabinet during its existence.

===Cabinet 2013–2021===
In the 2013 election, the incumbent red–green coalition government obtained 72 seats and lost its majority. The election ended with a victory for the four opposition non-socialist parties, winning a total of 96 seats out of 169 (85 needed for a majority). Following convention, Stoltenberg&#x27;s government resigned and handed over power in October 2013. The Labour Party, however, remained the largest party in parliament with 30.8% of the popular vote. The Progress Party also lost ground, but nevertheless participates in the new cabinet led by Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg. Among the smaller parties, the centrist Liberal Party and Christian Peoples Party hold the balance of power. Both campaigned on a change in government. On 30 September the two smaller parties announced that they would support a minority coalition of the Conservative and Progress parties, but they would not take seats in the cabinet themselves. The new Erna Solberg government was re-elected in 2017. In January 2020, right-wing Progress Party left the government. Prime Minister Erna Solberg continued with a minority government consisting of three coalition partners — her own Conservatives, the centrist Liberal Party and the Christian Democrats.

===Current cabinet===
In the 2021 election, the incumbent Solberg cabinet lost its majority. Jonas Gahr Støre of the Labour Party formed a minority coalition government with the Centre Party. The government relies on the support of the Socialist Left Party in order to secure a majority.
On 14 October 2021, Jonas Gahr Støre, the leader of Norway&#x27;s center-left Labor Party, was sworn in as new Prime Minister of Norway. His center-left minority government included ten women and nine men.

==Legislative branch==

Norway has a unicameral parliament, the Storting (&quot;Great Council&quot;), with members elected by popular vote for a four-year term (during which it may not be dissolved) by proportional representation in multi-member constituencies. Voting rights are granted in the year a person turns 18.

The Storting currently has 169 members (increased from 165, effective from the elections of 12 September 2005). The members are elected from the 19 counties for four-year terms according to a system of proportional representation. Until 2009, the Storting divided itself into two chambers, the &quot;Odelsting&quot; and the &quot;Lagting&quot; for the sole purpose of voting on legislation. Laws were proposed by the government through a member of the Council of State or by a member of the Odelsting and decided on by the Odelsting and Lagting, in case of repeated disagreement by the joint Storting. In practice, the Lagting rarely disagreed and mainly just rubber-stamped the Odelsting&#x27;s decision. In February 2007, the Storting passed a constitutional amendment to repeal the division, which abolished the Lagting for the 2009 general election, thereby establishing a fully unicameral system.

==Political parties and elections==

Elections are to be held every four years on the second Monday of September.
==Judicial branch==
The Norwegian legal system is a mixture of customary law, civil law system, and common law traditions; the Supreme Court renders advisory opinions to legislature when asked; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction, with reservations.

The regular courts include the Supreme Court () with 18 permanent judges and a president, courts of appeal (court of second instance in most cases), city and county courts (court of first instance in most cases), and conciliation councils (court of first instance in most civil-code cases). Judges attached to the regular courts are appointed by the King in council after nomination by the Ministry of Justice.

The special High Court of the Realm () hears impeachment cases against members of the government, parliament, or Supreme Court. Following an amendment to the Norwegian constitution in February 2007, impeachment cases are heard by the five highest ranking Supreme Court justices and six lay members in one of the Supreme Court courtrooms The High Court of the Realm had generally lost most of its significance after 1884, and this institution has been passive ever since 1927. The new system is meant to restore the to its earlier significance.

==Impeachment==
Impeachment may be brought against Members of the Council of State, or of the Supreme Court or of the Storting, for criminal offenses which they may have committed in their official capacity. Indictments are raised by the Storting and judged by five Supreme Court justices and six lay judges.

==Administrative divisions==

Civil Servant Recruitment Procedure:

-      Public Advertisement of Positions: All civil service positions are required to be advertised publicly, as mandated by the Civil Service Act, Section 4. Exceptions to this requirement are limited and must be legally justified, such as temporary positions lasting up to six months or specific cases outlined in collective agreements.

-      Qualification Principle: Central to the hiring process is the qualification principle, stipulated in Section 3 of the Civil Service Act. This principle mandates that the candidate with the best overall qualifications—considering education, experience, and personal suitability—be selected for the position. The criteria specified in the job posting serve as the basis for evaluating applicants.

-      Transparency and Appeals: The process emphasizes transparency, allowing applicants to access information about other candidates, such as names, ages, and qualifications. While direct appeals against hiring decisions are generally not permitted, applicants who believe procedural errors occurred can bring their concerns to the employer or relevant authorities. Additionally, cases involving potential discrimination can be addressed by the Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud.

Public Workforce Composition

According to the OECD&#x27;s Government at a Glance report, in 2021, the size of general government employment accounted for 30.92% of Norway&#x27;s total workforce, the highest proportion among OECD countries. Sweden followed with 29.27%, while Denmark and Finland reported similarly high shares at 28.04% and 25.41%, respectively. In contrast, South Korea and Japan had the lowest levels of general government employment among OECD countries, with government employment comprising only 8.83% and 4.55% of total employment, respectively.

Regarding gender representation, in 2020, Norway had the third-highest share of women in public sector employment among OECD countries in 2020, with women accounting for 69.99% of the public sector workforce. Sweden ranked the highest at 77.51%, followed by Finland at 72.19%.

In Norway, most public sector employees worked within local government as of 2023, with a total of 574,498 employees, while the central government employed 328,959 individuals.

In terms of salaries, the central government sector in Norway offered the highest average monthly pay in 2022, with men earning 61,370 Norwegian kroner and women earning approximately 54,620 kroner. In the local government sector, men earned an average of 49,420 kroner, while women earned 46,640 kroner.

Employment Benefits.

Holiday Leave: In Norway, the Holiday Act (Ferieloven) ensures that all employees are entitled to holiday leave and holiday pay. Employees can take 25 working days of leave each year, which equals four weeks and one day, as all days except Sundays. To qualify for the full leave, employees must start work by September 30; those starting after October 1 get six days of leave for that year. Holiday pay is based on earnings from the previous year. The standard rate is 10.2% of annual earnings, but it increases to 12% for employees with five weeks of leave (often through agreements) and 12.5% for employees over 60 who get an extra week of leave.

Parental leave: The Norwegian Working Environment Act provides parents with extensive leave rights to support family life. Pregnant employees are entitled to up to twelve weeks of leave during pregnancy, and mothers are required to take six weeks of leave after childbirth unless medically cleared to return to work earlier. Fathers are entitled to two weeks of leave to assist the mother, which may be transferred to another individual helping if the father is unavailable. Parents are jointly entitled to twelve months of leave, with an additional twelve months available to each parent immediately afterward. Single parents may take up to two years of leave. Adoptive and foster parents are granted the same rights, except in cases of stepchild adoption or if the child is over 15 years old.

The parental benefit period offers 49 weeks at full compensation (100% of income) or 59 weeks at a reduced rate (80% of income). For adoptive parents, the benefit period is shorter, providing 46 weeks at full compensation or 56 weeks at the reduced rate. To be eligible for parental benefits, individuals must be members of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme.

Public Organizational Structure.

The Constitution of Norway, established in 1814, defines the country as a monarchy with power divided among three branches: a legislative branch which is also responsible for appropriations, the Storting; an executive branch, the Government; and a judicial branch, the courts of law.

The King serves as the head of state, with his role primarily ceremonial and representative. Although the Constitution states that “the executive power is vested in the King,” this authority is exercised by the Government. The King performs important formal duties, such as officially opening the Storting (Norwegian parliament) each year and presiding over the Council of State at the Royal Palace. He also plays a significant role during government transitions and formally receives the credentials of newly appointed ambassadors during official audiences at the Royal Palace.

Executive authority operates within a three-tier administrative framework, comprising the central or national level, the regional or county level, and the local or municipal level.

Central government

The Central Government of Norway encompasses the Office of the Prime Minister and 16 ministries. It is responsible for national policymaking, drafting legislation (approved by the Storting), and overseeing the implementation of laws and policies through various ministries and agencies.

Responsibilities of the central government :

-      The National Insurance Scheme.

-      Specialised health services (hospitals).

-      Higher education/universities, labour market, refugees and immigrants.

-      National road network, railways, agricultural issues, environmental issues.

-      Police, courts, prisons, armed forces, foreign policy.

-      Specialised social services.

Local government

Local democracy is strong in Norway, and local government is well-established. The Alderman Act of 1837 first set out the rights and duties of local authorities. Both municipalities and counties hold elections where representatives are chosen by the people and are responsible to them. Oslo, the capital, is officially a municipality but also performs the responsibilities of a county authority. While municipalities and county authorities share the same administrative status, the central government has overall authority and oversees their administration.

Norway operates a two-tier local government system, consisting of municipalities and county authorities. As of January 1, 2024, Norway has 15 counties, an increase from 11 in 2023. This change is due to the division of Viken into the counties of Akershus, Buskerud, and Østfold. Similarly, Vestfold and Telemark have been separated into individual counties, as have Troms and Finnmark. These adjustments reverse the county mergers introduced in 2020. Norway also comprises 357 municipalities.

The mainland of Norway is divided into 11 counties (, singular ): Agder, Innlandet, Møre og Romsdal, Nordland, Oslo, Rogaland, Vestfold og Telemark, Troms og Finnmark, Trøndelag, Vestland, and Viken. This was reduced in 2020 from 18. In addition are the island group Svalbard and the island Jan Mayen.

Counties and municipalities have local autonomy, but this autonomy is circumscribed by national controls. Counties and municipalities are subject to the oversight of a governor () appointed by the King in the Council of State. One governor exercises authority in both Oslo and the adjacent county of Viken. Each county has a directly elected county assembly, led by a mayor, which decides upon matters falling within purview of the counties (upper secondary and vocational education, some culture, transport and social services). There is also a governor () on Svalbard, who is under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and not the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development as the other counties.

Responsibilities of County Authorities 

-       Upper secondary school • Regional development

-       County roads and public transport

-       Regional planning Business development

-       Culture (museums, libraries, sports)

-       Cultural heritage

-       Environmental issues.

Responsibilities of Municipalities 

-       Primary and lower secondary school.

-        Nurseries/kindergartens.

-       Primary healthcare.

-       Care for the elderly and disabled, social services.

-       Local planning, agricultural issues, environmental issues, local roads, harbours.

-       Water supply, sanitation and sewer. 

- Culture and business development.

== Dependent areas ==

Norway has three dependent areas, all in or near Antarctica: Bouvet Island in the South Atlantic Ocean, Queen Maud Land in Antarctica, and Peter I Island off West Antarctica. The Norwegian Act of 27 February 1930 declares these areas are subject to Norwegian sovereignty as dependencies.

An attempt to annex East Greenland ended in defeat at the Hague Tribunal in 1933.

== Public Participation Mechanisms ==
Norway’s governance system is internationally recognized for its emphasis on public participation, transparency, and inclusivity. These principles are rooted in the country’s democratic tradition, originating with the 1814 Norwegian Constitution, one of the oldest democratic constitutions in the world. The Constitution not only laid the foundation for participatory democracy but also empowered the Storting (Norwegian parliament) and strengthened electoral systems, ensuring that citizens play a direct role in governance.

Public participation in Norway is facilitated through a combination of legal frameworks and structured mechanisms. These ensure that citizens&#x27; voices are heard at every level of government, from local municipalities to national policymaking bodies.

=== Historical Context of Public Participation ===
Norway’s transition to a constitutional monarchy in 1814 marked the beginning of its participatory governance system. The 1814 Norwegian Constitution established foundational democratic principles such as the separation of powers, free elections, and civil liberties. Over time, Norway has continuously refined its governance mechanisms to ensure that citizens remain active participants in the democratic process. 

In 1837, the enactment of the &quot;Formannskapslovene&quot; (Municipalities Act) established local self-governance, granting municipalities significant autonomy and encouraging grassroots public participation. This system allowed municipal councils to address local issues independently, fostering robust local governance. Over time, the role of municipal councils has remained central to public participation, enabling citizens to engage directly with local governance and decision-making processes.

=== Legal Frameworks Supporting Public Participation ===
Public participation in Norway is supported by several key pieces of legislation:

The Local Government Act (2018): This act establishes the responsibilities of municipalities and counties to foster citizen engagement. It mandates that local governments provide platforms for public input during planning and decision-making processes. For instance, municipal councils are required to hold public hearings and consult citizens before approving major development projects. 

The Freedom of Information Act (2009): Transparency is a cornerstone of public trust in Norway’s governance. This act ensures that citizens have access to government documents, promoting transparency and accountability. Allowing citizens to request information, enhances informed participation and supports trust in governmental processes. 

The Environmental Information Act (2003): This law grants citizens the right to access environmental data from both public and private entities. It has been instrumental in empowering environmental advocacy groups and enabling citizens to participate in discussions on sustainability and climate change. 

These laws collectively create an environment where citizens can engage with their government in a meaningful way, ensuring that governance is responsive to public needs and concerns. 

=== Mechanisms for Citizen Engagement ===
Norway employs various mechanisms to facilitate public participation. These mechanisms are designed to ensure active citizen engagement in governance, ranging from traditional consultations to innovative digital approaches.

==== Municipal Planning and Local Engagement ====
Municipalities play a critical role in facilitating public participation in Norway. Citizens are often invited to contribute to local planning processes, particularly in areas such as urban development, education, and transportation. 

For example, urban renewal projects in cities like Trondheim incorporate extensive public input. Residents are encouraged to provide feedback on proposed designs, ensuring that development plans reflect community priorities.

==== Citizen Surveys and Panels ====
The Norwegian Citizen Panel, managed by the University of Bergen, is a prime example of how technology can enhance public participation. This web-based platform conducts regular surveys to collect data on public opinion regarding societal issues. The results are used by policymakers to gauge public sentiment and identify areas of concern. 

Citizen panels are also employed at the local level. These panels bring together a diverse group of residents to deliberate on complex policy issues. Their recommendations often influence municipal decision-making, demonstrating the value of inclusive governance.

==== Public Consultations ====
Public consultations are a cornerstone of Norway’s participatory governance model. These consultations allow citizens to provide feedback on proposed legislation and policies, ensuring that their perspectives are considered before decisions are finalized. 

A notable example of the effectiveness of public consultations is Norway&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government conducted extensive consultations with health experts, civil society organizations, and the general public, which enhanced the response&#x27;s effectiveness and strengthened public trust in government actions. This trust played a key role in successful crisis management, reflected in 80% of citizens expressing satisfaction with healthcare, 12 points above the OECD average (2022). 

==== Civil Society Organizations ====
Civil society organizations (CSOs) in Norway act as intermediaries between citizens and the government. These organizations represent diverse interests, from environmental advocacy to gender equality. CSOs also play a critical role in public debates often organizing workshops, seminars, and public forums to create spaces where citizens can engage in meaningful dialogue on policy issues.

For example, the Norwegian Association for Women’s Rights has been instrumental in promoting gender equality through lobbying and public awareness campaigns. By addressing societal issues, CSOs help ensure that public concerns are included in the policymaking process. Their activities foster a collaborative relationship between the public and the government, contributing to more inclusive governance.

==== Non-Governmental Organizations ====
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Norway significantly influence policymaking by advocating for a variety of interests and ensuring diverse perspectives are considered. These organizations often work closely with government bodies, providing expertise and contributing to the development of policies addressing societal needs. 

Organizations like the Norwegian Red Cross, play a vital role in policy discussions on disaster preparedness and public health. By participating in the formulation and implementation of policies, NGOs help shape initiatives that address pressing societal challenges. Their involvement ensures that policies are informed by a broad range of voices and experiences, fostering solutions that are both inclusive and effective.

==== Digital Platforms ====
Digital technology has transformed how citizens engage with the government in Norway, with platforms like DigiUng and Ung.no specifically designed to engage younger demographics. Ung.no, for instance, serves as a central hub for government services and information targeting individuals aged 13 to 20. It offers quality-assured resources, guidance, and a question-and-answer service that allows users to seek personalized support.

The platform exemplifies cross-sector collaboration and the use of digital tools to effectively target specific groups. In 2023, Ung.no recorded over 21.9 million visits and approximately 110,000 inquiries, demonstrating its significant reach and impact. By centralizing services and fostering youth participation, platforms like Ung.no enhance civic engagement and ensure public administration remains accessible and relevant to the next generation. 

==== Social Media Engagement ====
Social media has become a powerful tool for public engagement in Norway, enabling direct interaction between citizens and local governments. For instance, the Nesodden municipality uses platforms like Facebook to maintain communication with residents, providing a forward-thinking example of how local governments can foster real-time dialogue and transparency. 

By leveraging social media, municipalities create a more inclusive and collaborative environment for decision-making. These platforms make governance more accessible, particularly for younger, tech-savvy audiences. The use of social media enhances public trust by fostering transparency and ensuring that diverse perspectives are heard and considered.

== Managing Performance and Accountability in Norway ==

Norway’s public sector reforms have been shaped by globalization, economic shifts, and administrative challenges. The adoption of New Public Management (NPM) in the 1980s and 1990s aligned governance with global trends, emphasizing performance, efficiency, and accountability. Inspired by international models, particularly from the United Kingdom and New Zealand, Norway introduced performance-based management and decentralization 

Administrative inefficiencies and rising public expectations also drove reforms. Traditional bureaucratic structures were seen as rigid, costly, and ineffective, prompting demands for greater transparency and improved services. Norway responded with institutional restructuring, digital governance, and service delivery improvements to enhance responsiveness 

Economic shifts, including fluctuating oil revenues, influenced governance strategies. To ensure fiscal sustainability and efficiency, the government adopted budgetary optimization and performance-based management. Broader economic pressures in the 1980s and 1990s, including global recessions and rising welfare costs, accelerated the use of cost-control measures, performance budgeting, and accountability mechanisms 

Norway’s performance measurements follow NPM principles, emphasizing goal setting, monitoring, and evaluation through measurable indicators like service efficiency and operational outcomes 

=== Performance Measurement Systems ===

Norway&#x27;s Management by Objective Results (MBOR) framework, aligned with New Public Management (NPM) principles, emphasizes goal setting, monitoring, and structured evaluation to enhance government efficiency and accountability 

==== Core Components of MBOR: ====

• Annual Activity Plans: Each agency outlines strategic priorities and performance targets. For example, the Norwegian Health Directorate sets annual goals for reducing hospital wait times and improving patient satisfaction 

• Performance Indicators: 
1. Cost-efficiency ratios in public services, 2. Operational: Patient treatment rates in hospitals, 3. Service-Oriented: Citizen satisfaction surveys and service delivery metrics 

• Steering Dialogues: Ministries and subordinate agencies engage in continuous performance reviews to align goals with policy priorities 

==== MBOR has evolved through key policy reforms: ====
1. 1986 – Budget Reforms: Introduced productivity-oriented budgeting, giving agencies greater autonomy in resource allocation, 2. 1990 - MBOR Mandate: Required all public-sector units to adopt annual activity plans, strengthening political control and goal-setting clarity, 3. 1991 - Salary Reforms: Linked administrative leaders’ pay to performance, with compensation tied to individual contracts and annual assessments, 4. 1996 - New Government Financial Regulations: Formalized “Letters of Allocation”, contract-like agreements defining budget resources, objectives, and performance indicators 

=== Accountability Mechanisms ===

==== National Audit Office of Norway (NAO) ====
The National Audit of Norway (NAO Norway) is the independent audit agency of the Storting (Norwegian Parliament), ensuring financial accountability and transparency. It conducts government audits, and performance reviews, and monitors state-owned enterprises to ensure compliance with financial regulations and parliamentary decisions. 
Audit by the NAO revealed significant issues in Norway’s performance-based financing (PBF) system. Key findings included:

• Misclassified Cases: 41% of pneumonia cases were misclassified, requiring one in four admissions to be reassigned to a new Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG). This led to funding discrepancies and inefficiencies in resource allocation. 

• Coding Inconsistencies: Post-audit, pneumonia cases decreased from 2.7 to 2.3 conditions per admission, and hip replacements dropped from 1.5 to 1.0, highlighting systemic coding errors (see Table 4).

• Recommendations: The NAO called for improved coding accuracy, stricter oversight, and enhanced financial controls to ensure accurate reporting and fiscal accountability in Norway’s healthcare sector. 

==== The Norwegian Parliamentary Ombudsman ====

Sivilombudsmannen established in 1962, and appointed by the Storting, ensures fair administrations, protects individual rights, and uploads human rights standards in public governance. Unlike non-parliamentary ombudsmen in other countries, the Norwegian model operates independently from executive influence and reports directly to Parliament 

Performance
In 2021, the Ombud’s handled 4,032 complaints, resolving 50% through administrative corrections. It conducted 26 own-initiative investigations on prison monitoring, police access, and case processing delays, recommending procedural improvements 

==== Public Consultation Platforms ====

Høyringar allows citizens, organizations, and businesses to provide input on laws, regulations, and policies, ensuring transparency and public transportation. 

Key stages of the process
1. Proposal Submission: Ministries publish draft laws and policies, 2. Public Notification: Proposals are available on the consultation portal (Høringsportalen), 3. Feedback Collection: Stakeholders and the public submit opinions and recommendations digitally, 4. Revies: The government evaluates feedback and adjusts proposals, 5. Final Decision: Revised proposals proceed to Parliament or administrative adoption. 

=== Result-Oriented Reforms ===

Between 2000 and 2020, Norway has adopted several different performance-driven reforms to enhance public sector efficiency, service delivery, and governance. 

==== Healthcare Sector Reforms (2002 and 2012) ====

The 2002 hospital reform centralized public hospital ownership under the Ministry of Health while granting management autonomy to regional and local health enterprises. The reform aimed to improve efficiency and implement performance-based governance. 

The 2012 Collaboration Reform sought to improve coordination between municipal primary care and government-controlled secondary care through performance-based incentives, contracts, and agreements. 

The Results:
The Faster Return to Work (FRW) scheme introduced in 2007 reduced waiting times by 12–15 days and shortened sick leave by approximately 8 days on average. Surgical patients in the FRW scheme had 15–23 days shorter sick leave periods compared to those on regular waiting lists. 

==== Welfare Administration Reform (2005-2007) ====

The 2005 Welfare Administration Reform in Norway merged central government pensions and labor agencies into a single national entity, streamlining social welfare administration. A local partnership agreement was introduced integrating municipal social welfare bodies to enhance service coordination. By 2007, regional pension offices and administrative units were established, shifting certain responsibilities from local to regional levels of employment. 

==== Police Sector Reforms (2001 and 2015) ====

The 2001 reform centralized police governance under a central Police Agency, reducing police districts from 54 to 27. The 2015 “Community Police Reform” further consolidated police districts to 12 and local units from 350 to 210, aiming to strengthen emergency response. 

==== Regional and Municipal Reforms (2015 and 2020) ==== 

The 2015 Norwegian Municipal Reform aimed to consolidate municipalities from 428 to 356 due to local resistance. The 2020 Regional Reform reduced counties from 19 to 11, though few new responsibilities were transferred. 

==== Digitalization and Trust Reforms (2020) ==== 

The establishment of the Digitalization Agency in 2020 aimed to accelerate public sector digital transformation and enhance coordination, efficiency, and citizen services. 

In 2021, the Trust Reform was introduced, inspired by similar reforms in Denmark and Sweden. It aimed to reduce market-driven governance, enhance collaboration with labor organizations, and increase public sector employee involvement in decision-making. 

==== Education Reforms (2020) ====

The National Testing and Evaluation System was introduced by the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training in 2020 to measure school and student performance. 
Completion Reform Impact: Dropout rates in upper secondary education (VGO) have declined due to improved evaluation measures and targeted policies. The reform enhances early intervention and personalized learning to support student success. 

The Results:

• Mathematics Performance: Norway ranks 3rd out of 38 OECD countries with a 97.1% variation, among the highest compared to the OECD average. 

• Reading Performance: Norway ranks 11th out of 38 OECD countries, with an 88% variation, also among the largest in OECD assessments.
