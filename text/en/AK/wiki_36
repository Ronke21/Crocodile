<text>A village is a human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town with a population typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Although villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practice subsistence agriculture and also for some non-agricultural societies. In Great Britain, a hamlet earned the right to be called a village when it built a church. In many cultures, towns and cities were few, with only a small proportion of the population living in them. The Industrial Revolution attracted people in larger numbers to work in mills and factories; the concentration of people caused many villages to grow into towns and cities. This also enabled specialization of labor and crafts and the development of many trades. The trend of urbanization continues but not always in connection with industrialization. Historically, homes were situated together for sociability and defence, and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed. Traditional fishing villages were based on artisan fishing and located adjacent to fishing grounds.

In toponomastic terminology, the names of individual villages are called &quot;Comonyms&quot; (from Ancient Greek κώμη / village and ὄνυμα / name, [cf. ὄνομα]).

== Etymology ==
From Middle English &quot;&quot;, from Old French &quot;village&quot;, from Latin &quot;villāticus&quot;, ultimately from Latin &quot;villa&quot; (English &quot;villa&quot;).

==Central Asia==
=== Afghanistan ===
In Afghanistan, the village, or &quot;deh&quot; (Dari/Pashto: ده) is the mid-size settlement type in Afghan society, trumping the United States hamlet or &quot;qala&quot; (Dari: قلعه, Pashto: کلي), though smaller than the town, or &quot;shār&quot; (Dari: شهر, Pashto: ښار). In contrast to the &quot;qala&quot;, the &quot;deh&quot; is generally a bigger settlement which includes a commercial area, while the yet larger &quot;shār&quot; includes governmental buildings and services such as schools of higher education, basic health care, police stations etc.
===India===

&quot;The soul of India lives in its villages,&quot; declared Mahatma Gandhi at the beginning of 20th century. According to the 2011 census of India, 69% of Indians (around 833 million people) live in villages. As per 2011 census of India, there are a total of 649,481 villages in India .The size of these villages varies considerably. 236,004 Indian villages have a population of fewer than 500, while 3,976 villages have a population of 10,000+. Most of the villages have their own temple, mosque, or church, depending on the local religious following.

===Pakistan===

The majority of Pakistanis live in rural areas. According to the 2017 census, about 64% of the Pakistani population lives in rural areas. Most rural areas in Pakistan tend to be near cities, and are peri-urban areas. This is due to the definition of a rural area in Pakistan being an area that does not fall within an urban boundary. A village is called deh or gaaon in Urdu. Pakistani village life is marked by kinship and exchange relations.
===Kazakhstan===

Auyl () is a Kazakh word meaning &quot;village&quot; in Kazakhstan. According to the 2009 census of Kazakhstan, 42.7% of Kazakhstani citizens (7.5 million people) live in 8172 different villages. To refer to this concept along with the word &quot;auyl&quot; often used the Slavic word &quot;selo&quot; in Northern Kazakhstan.

==East Asia==

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===

In mainland China, villages are divisions under township or town .

===Republic of China (Taiwan)===

In the Republic of China (Taiwan), villages are divisions under townships or county-administered cities. The village is called a &quot;tsuen&quot; or &quot;cūn&quot; (村) under a rural township (鄉) and a &quot;li&quot; (里) under an urban township (鎮) or a county-controlled city. See also Li (unit).

=== Brunei ===

In Brunei, villages are officially the third- and lowest-level subdivisions of Brunei below districts and mukims. A village is locally known by the Malay word (also spelt as ). They may be villages in the traditional or anthropological sense but may also comprise delineated residential settlements, both rural and urban. The community of a village is headed by a village head (). Communal infrastructure for the villagers may include a primary school, a religious school providing or Islamic religious primary education which is compulsory for the Muslim pupils in the country, a mosque, and a community centre ( or ).

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, depending on the principles they are administered, villages are called &quot;kampung&quot; or &quot;desa&quot; (or &quot;kelurahan&quot; for those with urban functions). A &quot;desa&quot; (a term that derives from a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;country&quot; that is found in the name &quot;Bangladesh&quot;=&quot;bangla&quot; and &quot;desh/desha&quot;) is administered according to traditions and customary law (&quot;adat&quot;), while a &quot;kelurahan&quot; is administered along more &quot;modern&quot; principles. &quot;Desa&quot; are generally located in rural areas while &quot;kelurahan&quot; are generally urban subdivisions. A village head is respectively called &quot;kepala desa&quot; or &quot;lurah&quot;. Both are elected by the local community. A &quot;desa&quot; or &quot;kelurahan&quot; is the subdivision of a &quot;kecamatan&quot; (district), in turn the subdivision of a (regency) or &quot;kota&quot; (city).

The same general concept applies all over Indonesia. However, there is some variation among the vast numbers of Austronesian ethnic groups. For instance, in Bali villages have been created by grouping traditional hamlets or &quot;banjar&quot;, which constitute the basis of Balinese social life. In the Minangkabau area in West Sumatra province, traditional villages are called &quot;nagari&quot; (a term deriving from another Sanskrit word meaning &quot;city&quot;, which can be found in the name like &quot;Srinagar&quot;=&quot;sri&quot; and &quot;nagar/nagari&quot;). In some areas such as Tanah Toraja, elders take turns watching over the village at a command post. As a general rule, &quot;desa&quot; and &quot;kelurahan&quot; are groupings of hamlets (&quot;kampung&quot; in Indonesian, &quot;dusun&quot; in Javanese, &quot;banjar&quot; in Bali). a &quot;kampung&quot; is defined today as a village in Brunei and Indonesia.

===Malaysia and Singapore===
&quot;Kampung&quot; is a term used in Malaysia, (sometimes spelling &quot;kampong&quot; or &quot;kompong&quot; in the English language) for &quot;a Malay hamlet or village in a Malay-speaking country&quot;. In Malaysia, a &quot;kampung&quot; is determined as a locality with 10,000 or fewer people. Since historical times, every Malay village came under the leadership of a &quot;penghulu&quot; (village chief), who has the power to hear civil matters in his village (see Courts of Malaysia for more details).

A Malay village typically contains a &quot;masjid&quot; (mosque) or &quot;surau&quot;, paddy fields and Malay houses on stilts. Malay and Indonesian villagers practice the culture of helping one another as a community, which is better known as &quot;joint bearing of burdens&quot; (&quot;gotong royong&quot;). They are family-oriented (especially the concept of respecting one&#x27;s family [particularly the parents and elders]), courtesy and practice belief in God (&quot;Tuhan&quot;) as paramount to everything else. It is common to see a cemetery near the mosque. In Sarawak and East Kalimantan, some villages are called &#x27;long&#x27;, primarily inhabited by the Orang Ulu.

Malaysian &quot;kampung&quot; were once aplenty in Singapore but there are almost no remaining &quot;kampung&quot; villages; the very few to have survived until today are mostly on outlying islands surrounding mainland Singapore, such as Pulau Ubin. Mainland Singapore used to have many &quot;kampung&quot; villages but modern developments and rapid urbanisation works have seen them bulldozed away; Kampong Lorong Buangkok is the last surviving village on the country&#x27;s mainland.

The term &quot;kampung&quot;, sometimes spelled &quot;kampong&quot;, is one of many Malay words to have entered common usage in Malaysia and Singapore. Locally, the term is frequently used to refer to either one&#x27;s hometown or a rural village, depending on the intended context.

===Myanmar===
===Philippines===

In urban areas of the Philippines, the term &quot;village&quot; most commonly refers to private subdivisions, especially gated communities. These villages emerged in the mid-20th century and were initially the domain of elite urban dwellers. Those are common in major cities in the country and their residents have a wide range of income levels.

Such villages may or may not correspond to a barangay (the country&#x27;s basic unit of government, also glossed as village), or be privately administered. Barangays correspond more to precolonial villages; the chairman (formerly the village datu) now settles administrative, intrapersonal, and political matters or polices the area though with much less authority and respect than in Indonesia or Malaysia.

===Thailand===
===Vietnam===

Village, or &quot;làng&quot;, is a basis of Vietnam society. Vietnam&#x27;s village is the typical symbol of Asian agricultural production. Vietnam&#x27;s village typically contains: a village gate, &quot;lũy tre&quot; (bamboo hedges), &quot;đình làng&quot; (communal house) where &quot;thành hoàng&quot; (tutelary god) is worshiped, a common well, &quot;đồng lúa&quot; (rice field), &quot;chùa&quot; (temple) and houses of all families in the village. All the people in Vietnam&#x27;s villages usually have a blood relationship. They are farmers who grow rice and have the same traditional handicraft. Vietnam&#x27;s villages have an important role in society (Vietnamese saying: &quot;Custom rules the law&quot; -&quot;Phép vua thua lệ làng&quot; [literally: the king&#x27;s law yields to village customs]). It is common for Vietnamese villagers to prefer to be buried in their village upon death.

==Central and Eastern Europe==

===Slavic countries===

&quot;Selo&quot; (Cyrillic: село; ) is a Slavic word meaning &quot;village&quot; in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine. For example, there are numerous &quot;sela&quot; (села; plural of &quot;selo&quot;) called &quot;Novo Selo&quot; (Ново Село, &quot;New Village&quot;) in Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, and North Macedonia.

Another Slavic word for a village is &quot;ves&quot; (; ; ; ; ). In Slovenia, the word &quot;selo&quot; is used for very small villages (fewer than 100 people) and in dialects; the Slovene word &quot;vas&quot; is used all over Slovenia. In Russia and Bulgaria, the word &quot;ves&quot; is archaic, but remains in idioms and locality names, such as Vesyegonsk and Belevehchevo.

The most commonly used word for village in Slovak is &quot;dedina&quot; (dialectical also &quot;dzedzina&quot;). The word&#x27;s etymology may be (or may not be) rooted in the verb &quot;dediť&quot; (&quot;to inherit&quot;), referencing the inheriting of whole villages or properties within villages by noblemen or wealthy landowners. Another etymology could be related to the Sanskrit word &quot;deśá&quot; (देश) similar to the Afghan &quot;deh&quot;, Bengal &quot;desh&quot; and Indonesian &quot;desa&quot;. The term &quot;ves&quot; appears in settlement names (mostly villages, but also some towns that evolved over time from villages). The dialect term for village in east Slovakia is also &quot;valal&quot; (or &quot;valala&quot;). &quot;Dedina&quot; is unrelated to the rarer east Slavic term &quot;derevna&quot;, which refers to a village with wooden (&quot;derevo&quot;) housing.

====Bulgaria====

In Bulgaria, the different types of &quot;sela&quot; vary from a small selo of 5 to 30 families to one of several thousand people. According to a 2002 census, in that year there were 2,385,000 Bulgarian citizens living in settlements classified as &quot;villages&quot;. A 2004 Human Settlement Profile on Bulgaria conducted by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs stated that:
The most intensive is the migration &quot;city – city&quot;. Approximately 46% of all migrated people have changed their residence from one city to another. The share of the migration processes &quot;village – city&quot; is significantly less – 23% and &quot;city – village&quot; – 20%. The migration &quot;village – village&quot; in 2002 is 11%.

It also stated that
the state of the environment in the small towns and villages is good apart from the low level of infrastructure.

In Bulgaria, it is popular to visit villages for the atmosphere, culture, crafts, hospitality of the people and the surrounding nature. This is called &quot;selski turizam&quot; (), meaning &quot;village tourism&quot;.

====Russia====
In Russia, as of the 2010 Census, 26.3% of the country&#x27;s population lives in rural localities; down from 26.7% recorded in the 2002 Census. Multiple types of rural localities exist, but the two most common are &quot;derevnya&quot; () and &quot;selo&quot; (). Historically, the formal indication of status was religious: a city (&quot;gorod&quot;, ) had a cathedral, a &quot;selo&quot; had a church, while a &quot;derevnya&quot; had neither.

The lowest administrative unit of the Russian Empire, a &quot;volost&quot;, or its Soviet or modern Russian successor, a &quot;selsoviet&quot;, was typically headquartered in a &quot;selo&quot; and embraced a few neighboring villages.

In the 1960s–1970s, the depopulation of the smaller villages was driven by the central planners&#x27; drive in order to get the farm workers out of smaller, &quot;prospectless&quot; hamlets and into the collective or state farms&#x27; main villages or even larger towns and cities, with more amenities.

Most Russian rural residents are involved in agricultural work, and it is very common for villagers to produce their own food. As prosperous urbanites purchase village houses for their second homes, Russian villages sometimes are transformed into dacha settlements, used mostly for seasonal residence.

The historically Cossack regions of Southern Russia and parts of Ukraine, with their fertile soil and absence of serfdom, had a rather different pattern of settlement from central and northern Russia. While peasants of central Russia lived in a village around the lord&#x27;s manor, a Cossack family often lived on its own farm, called &quot;khutor&quot;. A number of such &quot;khutors&quot; plus a central village made up the administrative unit with a center in a &quot;stanitsa&quot; (; ). Such &quot;stanitsas&quot;, often with a few thousand residents, were usually larger than a typical &quot;selo&quot; in central Russia.

====Ukraine====

In Ukraine, a village, (, ), is considered the lowest administrative unit. Villages are under the jurisdiction of a hromada administration.

There is another smaller type of rural settlement which is designated in Ukrainian as a &quot;selyshche&quot; (). This type of community is often referred to in English as a &quot;settlement&quot;. In the new law about populated places in Ukraine the term &quot;selyshche&quot;, has a specific meaning. In the past the word &quot;selyshche&quot; was more ambiguous and there were distinction between rural &quot;selyshche&quot; and &quot;selyshche miskoho typu&quot; (urban-type settlement), abbreviated &quot;smt&quot; in Ukrainian. There we also &quot;dacha&quot;, fisherman, etc. &quot;selyshches&quot;

The &quot;khutir&quot; () and &quot;stanytsia&quot; () are not part of the administrative division any longer, primarily due to collectivization. &quot;Khutirs&quot; were very small rural localities consisting of just few housing units and were sort of individual farms. They became really popular during the Stolypin reform in the early 20th century. During the collectivization, however, residents of such settlements were usually declared to be kulaks and had all their property confiscated and distributed to others (nationalized) without any compensation. The &quot;stanitsa&quot; likewise has not survived as an administrative term. The &quot;stanitsa&quot; was a type of a collective community that could include one or more settlements such as villages, &quot;khutirs&quot;, and others. Today, &quot;stanitsa&quot;-type formations have only survived in Kuban (Russian Federation) where Ukrainians were resettled during the time of the Russian Empire.

===Ashkenazi Jewish culture===

A &quot;shtetl&quot; (plural &quot;shtetlekh&quot;) was a small market town or village with a majority Jewish population in central and eastern Europe. The word &quot;shtetl&quot; is Yiddish, derived from the word &quot;shtot&quot; (town) with the suffix &quot;-l&quot;, a diminutive. Shtetlekh first began to appear in the 13th century, and were characteristic aspects of Jewish life in central and Eastern Europe until the 1940s. The shtetl occupies an important place in Jewish collective memory (particularly the history of Ashkenazi Jews) and has been depicted extensively in literature, visual art, theatre, and film, including such examples as the writing of Mendele Mocher Sforim, Isaac Bashevis Singer, and Sholem Aleichem. Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s Tevye the Dairyman stories, set in the fictional shtetl of Anatevka, were eventually adapted into the Fiddler on the Roof stage play (which itself was later adapted for film).

During the Holocaust, most shtetlekh were depopulated of their Jewish communities through mass deportations or liquidations. Many are memorialized in yizkor books, written testimonies that describe the histories of Jewish communities destroyed during the Holocaust.

==Western and Southern Europe==

===France===

The Insee classifies French communes into four groups according to population density:

# Communes with high population density
# Communes with intermediate population density
# Communes with low population density
# Communes with very low population density

A commune in Group 3 or 4 is considered as a village (&quot;commune rurale&quot;).

An independent association named (affiliated to the international association The Most Beautiful Villages in the World), was created in 1982 to promote assets of small and picturesque French villages of quality heritage. As of July 2023, 172 villages in France have been listed in &quot;The Most Beautiful Villages of France&quot;.

===Germany===
In Germany a &quot;Dorf&quot; (village) usually consists of at least a few houses but can have up to a few thousand inhabitants. Larger villages can also be referred to as a &quot;Flecken&quot; or &quot;Markt&quot; depending on the region and the settlement&#x27;s market rights. Smaller villages usually do not have their own government. Instead, they are part () of the municipality of a nearby town.

===Italy===


In Italy, villages are spread throughout the country. No legal definition of village exists in Italian law; nonetheless, a settlement inhabited by less than 2000 people is usually described as &quot;village&quot;. More often, Italian villages that are a part of a municipality are called &quot;frazione&quot;, whereas the village that hosts the municipal seat is called &quot;paese&quot; (town) or &quot;capoluogo&quot;.

A non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest named &quot;I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia&quot; () and affiliated to the international association The Most Beautiful Villages in the World, was created in 2001 on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities with the aim of preserving and maintaining villages of quality heritage. Founded to contribute to safeguarding, conserving and revitalizing small villages and municipalities, but sometimes even individual hamlets, which, being outside the main tourist circuits, they risk, despite their great value, being forgotten with consequent degradation, depopulation and abandonment. Its motto is (&quot;The charm of hidden Italy&quot;). As of November 2023, 361 villages in Italy have been listed in &quot;The Most Beautiful Villages of Italy&quot;.

The criteria for admission to the association meet the following requirements: integrity of the urban fabric, architectural harmony, livability of the village, artistic-historical quality of the public and private building heritage, services to the citizen as well as the payment of an annual membership fee.

The association organizes initiatives within the villages, such as festivals, exhibitions, fetes, conferences and concerts that highlight the cultural, historical, gastronomic and linguistic heritage, involving residents, schools, and local artists. The club promotes numerous initiatives on the international market. In 2016, the association signed a global agreement with ENIT, to promote tourism in the most beautiful villages in the world. In 2017, the club signed an agreement with Costa Cruises for the enhancement of some villages, which are offered to cruise passengers arriving in Italian ports aboard the operator&#x27;s ships.

===Spain===

In Spain, a village (&quot;pueblo&quot;) refers to a small population unit, smaller than a town (&quot;villa&quot; [an archaic term that survives only in official uses, such as the official name of Spain&#x27;s capital, &quot;la Villa de Madrid&quot;]) and a city (&quot;ciudad&quot;), typically located in a rural environment. While commonly it is the smallest administrative unit (&quot;municipio&quot;), it is possible for a village to be legally composed of smaller population units in its territory. There is not a clear-cut distinction between villages, towns and cities in Spain, since they had been traditionally categorized according to their religious importance and their relationship with surrounding population units.

===Portugal===
Villages (&quot;aldeias&quot;, singular: &quot;aldeia&quot;) are more usual in the northern and central regions, Azores Islands and in the Alentejo. Most of them have a church and a &quot;Casa do Povo&quot; (people’s house), where the village&#x27;s summer &quot;romarias&quot; or religious festivities are usually held. Summer is also when many villages are host to a range of folk festivals and fairs, taking advantage of the fact that many of the locals who reside abroad tend to come back to their native village for the holidays.

===Netherlands===
In the flood-prone districts of the Netherlands, particularly in the northern provinces of Friesland and Groningen, villages were traditionally built on low man-made hills called terpen before the introduction of regional dyke-systems. In modern days, the term &quot;dorp&quot; (lit. &quot;village&quot;) is usually applied to settlements no larger than 20,000, though there&#x27;s no official law regarding status of settlements in the Netherlands.

===United Kingdom===

A village in the UK is a compact settlement of houses, smaller in size than a town, and generally based on agriculture or, in some areas, mining (such as Ouston, County Durham), quarrying or sea fishing. They are very similar to those in Ireland.

The major factors in the type of settlement are: location of water sources, organization of agriculture and landholding, and likelihood of flooding. For example, in areas such as the Lincolnshire Wolds, the villages are often found along the spring line halfway down the hillsides, and originate as spring line settlements, with the original open field systems around the village. In northern Scotland, most villages are planned to a grid pattern located on or close to major roads, whereas in areas such as the Forest of Arden, woodland clearances produced small hamlets around village greens. Because of the topography of the Clent Hills the north Worcestershire village of Clent is an example of a village with no centre but instead consists of series of hamlets scattered on and around the Hills.

Some villages have disappeared (for example, deserted medieval villages), sometimes leaving behind a church or manor house and sometimes nothing but bumps in the fields. Some show archaeological evidence of settlement at three or four different layers, each distinct from the previous one. Clearances may have been to accommodate sheep or game estates, or enclosure, or may have resulted from depopulation, such as after the Black Death or following a move of the inhabitants to more prosperous districts. Other villages have grown and merged and often form hubs within the general mass of suburbia—such as Hampstead, London and Didsbury in Manchester. Many villages are now predominantly dormitory locations and have suffered the loss of shops, churches and other facilities.

For many British people, the village represents an ideal of Great Britain. Seen as being far from the bustle of modern life, it is represented as quiet and harmonious, if a little inward-looking. This concept of an unspoilt Arcadia is present in many popular representations of the village such as the radio serial &quot;The Archers&quot; or the best kept village competitions.

Many villages in South Yorkshire, north Nottinghamshire, north east Derbyshire, County Durham, South Wales and Northumberland are known as pit villages. These (such as Murton, County Durham) grew from hamlets when the sinking of a colliery in the early 20th century resulted in a rapid growth in their population and the colliery owners built new housing, shops, pubs and churches. Some pit villages outgrew nearby towns by area and population; for example, Rossington in South Yorkshire came to have over four times more people than the nearby town of Bawtry. Some pit villages grew to become towns; for example, Maltby in South Yorkshire grew from 600 people in the 19th century to over 17,000 in 2007. Maltby was constructed under the auspices of the Sheepbridge Coal and Iron Company and included ample open spaces and provision for gardens.

In the UK, the main historical distinction between a hamlet and a village was that the latter had a church, and so usually was the centre of worship for an ecclesiastical parish. However, some civil parishes may contain more than one village. The typical village had a pub or inn, shops, and a blacksmith. But many of these facilities are now gone, and many villages are dormitories for commuters. The population of such settlements ranges from a few hundred people to around five thousand. A village is distinguished from a town in that:
* A village should not have a regular agricultural market, although today such markets are uncommon even in settlements which clearly are towns.
* A village does not have a town hall nor a mayor.
* If a village is the principal settlement of a civil parish, then any administrative body that administers it at parish level should be called a parish council or parish meeting, and not a town council or city council. However, some civil parishes have no functioning parish, town, or city council nor a functioning parish meeting. In Wales, where the equivalent of an English civil parish is called a Community, the body that administers it is called a Community Council. However, larger councils may elect to call themselves town councils. In Scotland, the equivalent is also a community council, however, despite being statutory bodies they have no executive powers.
* There should be a clear green belt or open fields, as, for example, seen on aerial maps for Ouston surrounding its parish borders. However this may not be applicable to urbanised villages: although these may not be considered to be villages, they are often widely referred to as being so; an example of this is Horsforth in Leeds.

==Middle East==

===Lebanon===
Like France, villages in Lebanon are usually located in remote mountainous areas. The majority of villages in Lebanon retain their Aramaic names or are derivative of the Aramaic names, and this is because Aramaic was still in use in Mount Lebanon up to the 18th century.

Many of the Lebanese villages are a part of districts, these districts are known as &quot;kadaa&quot; which includes the districts of Baabda (Baabda), Aley (Aley), Matn (Jdeideh), Keserwan (Jounieh), Chouf (Beiteddine), Jbeil (Byblos), Tripoli (Tripoli), Zgharta (Zgharta / Ehden), Bsharri (Bsharri), Batroun (Batroun), Koura (Amioun), Miniyeh-Danniyeh (Minyeh / Sir Ed-Danniyeh), Zahle (Zahle), Rashaya (Rashaya), Western Beqaa (Jebjennine / Saghbine), Sidon (Sidon), Jezzine (Jezzine), Tyre (Tyre), Nabatiyeh (Nabatiyeh), Marjeyoun (Marjeyoun), Hasbaya (Hasbaya), Bint Jbeil (Bint Jbeil), Baalbek (Baalbek), and Hermel (Hermel).

The district of Danniyeh consists of thirty-six small villages, which includes Almrah, Kfirchlan, Kfirhbab, Hakel al Azimah, Siir, Bakhoun, Miryata, Assoun, Sfiiri, Kharnoub, Katteen, Kfirhabou, Zghartegrein, Ein Qibil.

Danniyeh (known also as Addinniyeh, Al Dinniyeh, Al Danniyeh, Arabic: سير الضنية) is a region located in Miniyeh-Danniyeh District in the North Governorate of Lebanon. The region lies east of Tripoli, extends north as far as Akkar District, south to Bsharri District and Zgharta District and as far east as Baalbek and Hermel. Dinniyeh has an excellent ecological environment filled with woodlands, orchards and groves. Several villages are located in this mountainous area, the largest town being Sir Al Dinniyeh.

An example of a typical mountainous Lebanese village in Dannieh would be Hakel al Azimah which is a small village that belongs to the district of Danniyeh, situated between Bakhoun and Assoun&#x27;s boundaries. It is in the centre of the valleys that lie between the Arbeen Mountains and the Khanzouh.

===Syria===
Syria contains a large number of villages that vary in size and importance, including the ancient, historical and religious villages, such as Ma&#x27;loula, Sednaya, and Brad (Mar Maroun&#x27;s time). The diversity of the Syrian environments creates significant differences between the Syrian villages in terms of the economic activity and the method of adoption. Villages in the south of Syria (Hauran, Jabal al-Druze), the north-east (the Syrian island) and the Orontes River basin depend mostly on agriculture, mainly grain, vegetables, and fruits. Villages in the region of Damascus and Aleppo depend on trading. Some other villages, such as Marmarita depend heavily on tourist activity.

Mediterranean cities in Syria, such as Tartus and Latakia have similar types of villages. Mainly, villages were built in very good sites which had the fundamentals of the rural life, like water. An example of a Mediterranean Syrian village in Tartus would be al-Annazah, which is a small village that belongs to the area of al-Sauda. The area of al-Sauda is called a &quot;nahiya&quot;.

==Oceania==

Pacific Islands
Communities on Pacific islands were historically called villages by English speakers who traveled and settled in the area. Some communities such as several Villages of Guam continue to be called villages despite having large populations that can exceed 40,000 residents.

New Zealand
The traditional Māori village was the pā, a fortified hill-top settlement. Tree-fern logs and flax were the main building materials. As in Australia (see below) the term is now used mainly in respect of shopping or other planned areas.

Australia
The term village often is used in reference to small planned communities such as retirement communities or shopping districts, and tourist areas such as ski resorts. Small rural communities are usually known as townships. Larger settlements are known as towns.

==South America==
Argentina
Usually set in remote mountainous areas, some also cater to winter sports or tourism. See Uspallata, La Cumbrecita, Villa Traful and La Cumbre.

Guyana
In various areas villages can still be found in Guyana. While many are now towns, there are several areas on river banks, and communities off central roads that are still locally considered villages.

Uruguay
Village or &quot;villa&quot; is one of the three levels at which the government classifies urbanizations or &quot;localidades&quot;, a &quot;villa&quot; is highest rank than a &quot;pueblo&quot; which is the lowest unit and lower than a city or &quot;ciudad&quot;, which is the highest rank. This organization is more related with notability than size, since there is no official criteria to determine the level of urbanization. Every urbanization is a &quot;pueblo&quot; unless is elevated by decree to the next category. Historically this was a faculty of the executive power but more recently this faculty was transferred to the legislative. However colloquial speech still refers as &quot;pueblo&quot; to most &quot;villas&quot; and even cities and many names preceded by the word &quot;villa&quot; could represent other standard, such as &quot;Villa del Cerro&quot; or &quot;Villa Serrana&quot;.

==North America==
In contrast to the Old World, the concept of village in Canada and the United States today is largely disconnected from its rural and communal origins. The situation is different in Mexico because of its large bulk of indigenous population living in traditional villages.

===Canada===
It is believed that the name Canada may be a transliteration of the Iroquoisan word for &quot;village&quot;. Jacques Cartier was given directions to the Kanata of Kebec and it became the name of the French Colonial district before it was the nation&#x27;s name.

===United States===

====Incorporated villages====
In twenty U.S. states, the term &quot;village&quot; refers to a specific form of incorporated municipal government, similar to a city but with less authority and geographic scope. However, this is a generality; in many states, there are villages that are an order of magnitude larger than the smallest cities in the state. The distinction is not necessarily based on population, but on the relative powers granted to the different types of municipalities and correspondingly, different obligations to provide specific services to residents.

In some states such as New York and Michigan, a village is an incorporated municipality, within a single town or civil township. In some cases, the village may be with the town or township, in which case the two may have a consolidated government. There are also villages that span the boundaries of more than one town or township; some villages may straddle county borders.

There is no population limit to villages in New York. Hempstead, the largest village, has 55,000 residents, making it more populous than some of the state&#x27;s cities. However, villages in the state may not exceed in area. Michigan and Illinois also have no set population limit for villages and there are many villages that are larger than cities in those states. The village of Schaumburg, Illinois had 78,723 residents as of the 2020 census. A village also has no written figure against how small a population can be, with the United States&#x27; smallest incorporated village being Dering Harbor, NY, with a population of just over 10.

In Michigan, a village is always legally part of a township. Villages can incorporate land in multiple townships and even multiple counties. The largest village in the state is Beverly Hills in Southfield Township which had a population of 10,267 people as of the 2010 census.

In the state of Wisconsin, a village is always legally separate from the towns that it has been incorporated from. The largest village is Menomonee Falls, which has over 32,000 residents. In Pennsylvania law, the term borough is used to refer to the same type of entity. 80% of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 956 boroughs have populations of less than 5,000 but about thirty have populations of over 10,000 with State College having more than 40,000 residents.

In Ohio villages are usually legally part of the township from which they were incorporated, although exceptions such as Hiram exist, in which the village is separate from the township. Villages become cities if they grow to a population of at least 5,000.

In Maryland, a locality designated &quot;Village of ...&quot; may be either an incorporated town or a special tax district. An example of the latter is the Village of Friendship Heights.

In North Carolina, the only difference between cities, towns, and villages is the term itself.

====Unincorporated villages====

In many states, the term &quot;village&quot; is used to refer to a relatively small unincorporated community, similar to a hamlet in New York state. This informal usage may be found even in states that have villages as an incorporated municipality, although such usage might be considered incorrect and confusing.

In most New England states, a &quot;village&quot; is a center of population or trade, including the town center, in an otherwise sparsely developed town or city — for instance, the village of Hyannis in the town of Barnstable, Massachusetts. However, in Vermont and Connecticut, both incorporated and unincorporated villages exist.

==Africa==

===Nigeria===
Villages in Nigeria vary significantly because of cultural and geographical differences.

Northern Nigeria

In the North, villages were under traditional rulers long before the Jihad of Shaikh Uthman Bin Fodio and after the Holy War. At that time Traditional rulers used to have absolute power in their administrative regions.
After Dan Fodio&#x27;s Jihad in 1804, political structure of the North became Islamic where emirs were the political, administrative and spiritual leaders of their people. These emirs appointed a number of people to assist them in running the administration and that included villages.

Every Hausa village was reigned by Magaji (Village head) who was answerable to his Hakimi (mayor) at the town level. The Magaji also had his cabinet who assisted him in ruling his village efficiently, among whom was Mai-Unguwa (Ward Head).

With the creation of Native Authority in Nigerian provinces, the autocratic power of village heads along with all other traditional rulers was subdued hence they ruled &#x27;under the guidance of colonial officials&#x27;.

Even though the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has not recognised the functions of traditional rulers, they still command respect in their villages and political office holders liaise with them almost every time to reach people.

In Hausa language, village is called &quot;ƙauye&quot; and every local government area is made up of several small and large &quot;ƙauyuka&quot; (villages). For instance, Girka is a village in Kaita town in Katsina state in Nigeria. They have mud houses with thatched roofing though, like in most of the villages in the North, zinc roofing has become a common sight.

Still in many villages in the North, people do not have access to potable water. So they fetch water from ponds and streams. Others are lucky to have wells within a walking distance. Women rush in the morning to fetch water in their clay pots from wells, boreholes and streams. However, the government is now providing them with water bore holes.

Electricity and GSM network are reaching more and more villages in the North almost every day. So bad feeder roads may lead to remote villages with electricity and unstable GSM network.

Southern Nigeria

Village dwellers in the Southeastern region lived separately in &quot;clusters of huts belonging to the patrilinage&quot;. As the rainforest region is dominated by Igbo speaking people, the villages are called &quot;ime obodo&quot; (inside town) in Igbo language. A typical large village might have a few thousand persons who shared the same market, meeting place and beliefs.

=== South Africa===
In South Africa the majority of people in rural areas reside in villages. They vary in size from having a population of less than 500 to around 1000.

<text>Catatonia were an alternative rock band from Wales who gained popularity in the mid-to-late 1990s. The band formed in 1992 after Mark Roberts met Cerys Matthews and Kirsty Kennedy. The first major lineup featured Dafydd Ieuan of Super Furry Animals on drums, Paul Jones on bass, and Clancy Pegg on keyboards. With this line-up the band recorded two EPs, &quot;For Tinkerbell&quot; and &quot;Hooked&quot;.

Pegg was fired prior to work on their first studio album, &quot;Way Beyond Blue&quot;, and during the recording of the album the band was joined by drummer Aled Richards, replacing Ieuan, who left to focus full-time on Super Furry Animals. During the live promotional appearances for the album the band was joined by guitarist Owen Powell. This latest incarnation of the band lasted until its dissolution in 2001. The single &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Lot to Answer For&quot; received radio airplay and became the band&#x27;s first top 40 single in the UK Singles Chart in September 1996. Their breakout success came at the start of 1998 with the &quot;International Velvet&quot; album and the release of the single &quot;Mulder and Scully&quot; some two weeks apart. The album went to number one in the UK Albums Chart, and sold more than 900,000 copies being certified triple platinum by British Phonographic Industry, while the single reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart, the highest any Catatonia single would chart.

The follow-up release, &quot;Road Rage&quot;, reached number 5 in May, and was nominated for best song at the Brit Awards and the Ivor Novello Awards, winning at the Q Awards. The title track of the album &quot;International Velvet&quot; received additional attention, and the band performed it at the opening of the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup on 1 October in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. While in Catatonia, Matthews collaborated with Space on &quot;The Ballad of Tom Jones&quot; in March 1998 and with Tom Jones on a cover of &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; in December 1999. Their final top ten single came in April 1999 with &quot;Dead from the Waist Down&quot; off the following album, &quot;Equally Cursed and Blessed&quot;. Rumours began to circulate about a breakup, but a further album, &quot;Paper Scissors Stone&quot; was released in 2001 following a two-year break from live performances.

Matthews&#x27; drinking had long been reported in the tabloids and gossip columns, and she entered rehab in mid-2001 for drinking and smoking. The tour to support &quot;Paper Scissors Stone&quot; was cancelled, and a month later, the band announced that they were breaking up. Matthews has subsequently released solo albums, while Powell has become a radio presenter and joined the supergroup The Stand to release a charity single. Critics have highlighted the use of metaphors in Catatonia&#x27;s work, as well as comparing songs to poetry. Writing duties had been shared across the band, although had been led by Matthews and Roberts. They disagreed with being labelled an indie band, with Powell saying they had only ever sought to write pop music. The band were considered a key band of 1990s Cool Cymru.

==History==
===Formation (1992)===
The story that Catatonia were formed after Mark Roberts spotted Cerys Matthews busking in Cardiff in 1992 was an invention for the media in order to give the band a newsworthy biography. While the duo did go busking, they did not meet this way. Matthews had been a fan of Roberts&#x27; previous band Y Cyrff. They began dating as well as writing songs together at the end of 1991. For four years after this they remained in the relationship, many aspects of this being played out publicly in their lyrics. They took the name of the band from Matthews&#x27; experience working in a mental health facility as well as the novel &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; by Aldous Huxley. They believed it to mean a sense of extreme pleasure and sleep, and wrote the song &quot;Sweet Catatonia&quot;, subsequently naming the band after the song. As Sweet Catatonia, Matthews and Roberts recorded a series of demos at the city centre youth project in Cardiff, nicknamed &quot;Grassroots&quot;.

Roberts and Matthews routinely encountered Owen Powell during this time, who played guitar in the band Colour 45. Both bands entered a band competition to play at the Cardiff Bay Music Fiesta, and while Colour 45 came tenth and was given a place on the bill, Sweet Catatonia placed 45th. Roberts and Matthews hired a drummer, Stephen &quot;Frog&quot; Jenkins from the band U Thant, and continued to record bilingual Welsh/English tracks. The band began to play live, with Matthews and Roberts busking to support their income. They were spotted by the girlfriend of the lead singer of the band The Pooh Sticks, who thought that Matthews would make a good female voice for the group. But after seeing Sweet Catatonia perform, the band members did not agree and so Matthews remained with Catatonia. Further recordings were made, with Guto Pryce joining the trio. This session included the track &quot;Gyda Gwen&quot; which attracted the attention of Rhys Mwyn at Crai Records.

===The Crai EPs, &quot;Whale&quot;, and &quot;Bleed&quot; (1993–95)===
The band line up changed as they signed to Crai, with Jenkins and Pryce departing for other projects. Mwyn arranged for Matthews and Roberts to be joined by Dafydd Ieuan on drums, former Y Cyrff member Paul Jones on bass, and Londoner Clancy Pegg (who had befriended Roberts and Matthews after moving to Cardiff) on keyboards. It was at this point that the band shortened its name to &quot;Catatonia&quot;. Mwyn used his contacts to get Catatonia onto Welsh language television, and strove to move their live performances away from Cardiff so that they were not simply playing in front of their regulars the entire time. They had their first overseas gigs in Germany, support Mwyn in his punk band Anrhefn. Catatonia were hired by political party Plaid Cymru to headline a Welsh language concert at Builth Wells in August 1993, but they performed in both Welsh and English.

Despite being signed to Crai, this was more as promoter than as a record label itself. It was only when Roberts suggested that Catatonia record some extended plays (EPs) after two months with the label that Mwyn made the arrangements. The first, entitled &quot;For Tinkerbell&quot;, had a cover photo taken by Roberts and Matthews&#x27; housemate Roland Dafis. Mwyn successfully got the record on BBC Radio 1 after sending a copy to radio presenter Mark Radcliffe. After Iestyn George heard the release, the journalist named it as the record of the week for the magazine &quot;NME&quot;. &quot;For Tinkerbell&quot; contained some early tracks, including a version of &quot;Sweet Catatonia&quot;. Matthews later explained that while she had liked the songs on the EP, she felt that she was not good at performing live at the time. They signed to Nursery Records to release the single &quot;Bleed&quot;. Catatonia&#x27;s first national interview was published following the release of &quot;For Tinkerbell&quot;, a 300-word piece appearing in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

They held their first London gigs in support of the EP, under the advice of George and The Pooh Sticks lead singer Hue Williams. After warm-up gigs in Cardiff and Birmingham, the London performance took place at the Samuel Beckett pub in Stoke Newington on 13 November 1993 alongside Anrehfn and Margi Clarke. Further Welsh radio and television appearances followed, as did an interview for &quot;NME&quot;. When George arrived for the interview, Matthews asked if he&#x27;d be interested in becoming the band&#x27;s manager. He politely declined, saying that he did not have the experience. On 19 and 20 February 1994, the band&#x27;s follow-up EP, &quot;Hooked&quot; was recorded in Llandwrog, Gwynedd, and produced by Ken Nelson who they had met on Radio Wales. A performance was set up at The Falcon, Camden the Splash Club in London where several music executives were to be present. The band drove down from Cardiff in a Ford Transit with their equipment and then spent the afternoon drinking. Just prior to going out on stage, they began taking cocaine, the result of which was a terrible performance later lamented by Roberts. The trip became a sobering experience, as they made no money from it and were only paid £50 for a gig at Kingston University a day later. Matthews later recalled that they&#x27;d needed to borrow money from a fan to pay the toll on the Severn Bridge on the way back to Cardiff.

The band returned to the Falcon, where they played a still shambolic, but better gig in front of record executives. Meanwhile, George had put the band in touch with their first manager, Richard Lowe from MRM management. They made further appearances on Welsh television to support the release of &quot;Hooked&quot; in May, but another drunken performance followed, this time in Newport. MRM sent them on a short tour in France during the second week of May, and then started their first UK wide support tour to the band Salad. When due to perform at the Cnapan Music Festival in Wales on 2 July, the band ran into some difficulties. The security team refused to let Matthews in as they did not recognise her. It was only after the intervention of one of the fans of the band, actor Rhys Ifans, that she was allowed in.

Mwyn departed the band when the band&#x27;s time with Crai came to an end, and a few weeks later MRM sought to remove Pegg, leaving it to Matthews to tell her. Pegg was upset, and refused to discuss it with journalists. After her departure, the single &quot;Whale&quot; was published on the Rough Trade Records label. The band had rushed to record it, having only been given a month&#x27;s notice by the label that one of their songs would be released as a single in September 1994. &quot;Whale&quot; was named the &quot;NME&quot; single of the week, as &quot;For Tinkerbell&quot; had been the previous year. The band appeared in the mainstream press for two incidents, the first was when they were thrown off a train at Swindon as they were travelling to London after arguing with a train guard about punk rock, and the other when they swore at the bouncers in Welsh at the Underworld club in Camden and were banned. A further single, &quot;Bleed&quot; was recorded the following November, and was released in February 1995 on Nursery Records. Geoff Travis, who had released &quot;Whale&quot; for his Rough Trade Records, offered the band £350,000 to sign for Blanco y Negro Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records. They duly signed.

===&quot;Way Beyond Blue&quot; (1996)===
The band began work on a debut album, alongside producer Paul Sampson. Ieuan introduced Sampson to Aled Richards, who later replaced him as Catatonia&#x27;s drummer when Ieuan left to join the Super Furry Animals. The label wanted to market the band, and so at some expense, had photographer Gered Mankowitz conduct a photoshoot with Matthews. She, the band and their management all hated the photos, but the label wanted to use them in order not to write the cost off as a loss. In order to have some photos, a series of black and white photos of Matthews drinking a bottle of wine while wearing a Pepsi T-shirt were taken by one of the press agency staff. Warner Bros liked the images and authorised their use. The band had a recording session at Sawmills Studios, Cornwall, which saw some disagreements during recording between Matthews and Roberts. Afterwards, Sampson was removed as producer following a row over the arrangement for &quot;Sweet Catatonia&quot;.

Music reviewers responded with surprise when the band began to perform live while sober. Meanwhile, the release of &quot;Sweet Catatonia&quot; as a single was pushed back to January 1996 due to the issues with finding a new producer. The first time subsequent producer Stephen Street met the band was when they arrived to record at the Maison Rouge Studios in London. They found working with him far easier than Sampson, as Matthews later explained that he took their ideas into account. Ieuan left during the recording of the album to join Super Furry Animals, and was subsequently replaced by Aled Richards. They returned to live performances after completing the recording of the album, and decided to actively look for a second guitarist. They ultimately hired Colour 45&#x27;s Owen Powell, who by this time was working as a music technician for the Super Furry Animals, to this role.

As they prepared for the album, they released a special release for the Catatonia fanclub which had formed after &quot;Bleed&quot;. Containing &quot;Blow the Millenium, Blow&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Sailor&quot;, the vinyl record was sent to all members. The following month, on 18 January 1996, &quot;Sweet Catatonia&quot; was released. It became the first Catatonia single to reach the UK singles chart, peaking at 61st position. MRM sought to expand the profile of the band in Europe, publishing the compilation &quot;The Sublime Magic of Catatonia&quot;. The band toured the UK, supported by Liverpool-based band Space, and while touring &quot;Lost Cat&quot; was released on 22 April. It just missed out on the top 40, reaching 41st position. As part of the tour, they appeared at several music festivals that year including Reading, Phoenix and at Madstock! 3 in London.

Catatonia began to get radio exposure with the single &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Lot to Answer For&quot;, which entered the top 40 for the first time in September 1996. After several delays, the album &quot;Way Beyond Blue&quot; was released on 30 September. There were 12 tracks, several of which had appeared on previous EPs and as b-sides to singles. On the background of the successful album, there were problems behind the scenes. Matthew&#x27;s and Robert&#x27;s relationship broke down, with Roberts ending it and seeing someone else within days. The duo sought to keep the band together despite the problems, and they found a way to continue working together. Warner Bros. Records had intended to release &quot;Lost Cat&quot; from &quot;Way Beyond Blue&quot; in the United States, but due to problems at the record label this did not occur.

===&quot;International Velvet&quot; (1997–98)===
While Roberts sought to begin work on a second album, they began to tour with fellow Welsh band The Manic Street Preachers as a support act, and the label released the compilation &quot;Tourist EP&quot; in Japan. They began recording demos for a new album in Cardiff at the start of January 1997. The subject matter was mostly based on the stories coming out of Roberts and Matthews&#x27; breakup. They booked in a recording session for the second album in June, at the Monnow Valley Studio in Rockfield, Monmouthshire. In the run up to the recording, they performed for the first time in the United States, supporting The Boo Radleys in New York. They went on to perform in Austin, Texas and in Los Angeles during March. The following month, they conducted a ten-night tour of the UK, in which songs such as &quot;Mulder and Scully&quot; made their first public appearances.

As they worked on the album, Catatonia feared that they were about to be dropped by their record label, which they summed up in the song &quot;That&#x27;s All Folks&quot;. Further references to difficulties with Warner Bros were included in &quot;I Am the Mob&quot;, but they preferred working with producer TommyD on the production than they had with those on &quot;Way Beyond Blue&quot;. The first single off the album had intended to be &quot;Mulder and Scully&quot;, but the label insisted that &quot;I Am the Mob&quot; was released instead. As with previous works, this was delayed, and Catatonia performed at festivals during the summer of 1997 while they waited for the release. They were booked for the Glastonbury Festival, but upon arriving they were told their spot had been cancelled. Matthews continued to get the band mentioned in the gossip columns of newspapers due to her drunken behaviour. One example followed an incident at a party celebrating the victory of the yes vote in the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum, as when asked how she felt about the result, she responded &quot;What we want to know is who is going to shag Siân Lloyd?&quot; Lloyd subsequently launched legal action, but accepted an apology from Matthews.

The new album was further delayed as Warner Bros ordered the removal of the six-minute-long anti-Warner track &quot;That&#x27;s All Folks&quot;. Meanwhile, work continued on &quot;I Am The Mob&quot; with a video shoot directed by Kevin Allen. The single was released on 6 October and entered the top 40 for a single week in the 40th position. Catatonia found their roles reversed shortly afterwards, performing as the support act to Space after the Liverpudlians had a series of top 20 singles. They finished off the year with a tour of their own, originally aimed to support the new album, but this was still being held back by the label. Warners replaced &quot;That&#x27;s All Folks&quot; with &quot;My Selfish Gene&quot;, and agreed to release &quot;Mulder and Scully&quot; in January 1998 and &quot;International Velvet&quot; some two weeks later.

&quot;Mulder and Scully&quot; launched them into the mainstream public consciousness when it was released on 19 January 1998. It entered the charts at number 3; the highest position a single by Catatonia would ever achieve. &quot;International Velvet&quot; became the breakout album for the band, charting at number one in the UK Album Charts. The album sold more than 900,000 copies in 22 months, being certified triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. &quot;International Velvet&quot; was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize 1998, which was awarded to Gomez for &quot;Bring It On&quot;.

Of the five singles released from the album, &quot;Road Rage&quot; became the most critically acclaimed, being nominated for best single at both the Ivor Novello Awards and the Brit Awards, while winning in that category at the Q Awards. Despite this, it did not chart as high as &quot;Mulder and Scully&quot;, reaching number 5 on the UK Singles Charts. The subsequent releases &quot;Strange Glue&quot; and &quot;Game On&quot; did not get into the top ten, reaching number 11 and number 33 respectively.

The title track of the album, &quot;International Velvet&quot;, featuring the line &quot;Every day when I wake up I thank the Lord I&#x27;m Welsh&quot; and Welsh language verses, received additional attention from the media. Matthews explained in an interview that she wanted to turn to invert the idea of being Welsh from an apparent negative into a positive, &quot;We&#x27;re not seen to be very good at anything. Our football team is shit. The song is saying, despite all these things, I still wake up in the morning and thank the Lord that I&#x27;m Welsh. Hopefully, by now people realise that Wales is brimmed full of talent and we&#x27;re great people with massive brains.&quot; In front of 70,000 spectators, Catatonia performed &quot;International Velvet&quot; at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The album became the first to be released for Catatonia in the United States, but failed to chart. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;overlooked&quot;.

===&quot;Equally Cursed and Blessed&quot; (1999–2000)===
Following the success of &quot;International Velvet&quot;, and the heavy touring that followed, the band were pleased to return to the Monnow Valley Studio to record a third studio album. On the recommendation of TommyD, the band had been recording sample tracks onto a DPS12 hard disk recorder in their tour bus while on an American tour and they returned to Monnow Valley to record them properly. The band felt less pressure on them for the new album, due to the success of &quot;International Velvet&quot; and because they no longer feared being dropped by the label.

In January 1999, the band announced their new album, &quot;Equally Cursed and Blessed&quot;. The title was taken from a line from &quot;She&#x27;s A Millionaire&quot;, a song on the album. Preceded by the first single, &quot;Dead from the Waist Down&quot; on 22 March, &quot;Equally Cursed and Blessed&quot; was released on 12 April. The album, like &quot;International Velvet&quot;, reached the top spot in the UK charts. Catatonia were so popular at the time that in April 1999, &quot;Way Beyond Blue&quot;, &quot;International Velvet&quot; and &quot;Equally Cursed and Blessed&quot; were all in the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart. But, the singles from &quot;Equally Cursed and Blessed&quot; did not repeat the success seen in the previous album. &quot;Dead From The Waist Down&quot; ended up becoming the final single by Catatonia to reach the top ten in the singles charts, getting to number seven in the UK singles charts. &quot;Londinium&quot; reached number 20, while &quot;Karaoke Queen&quot; barely entered the top 40 at number 36.

In May, they played two outdoor concerts at the Llangollen International Pavilion in front of 6,000 people on successive days. This was a warm up to their largest concert so far, held at Margam Country Park near Port Talbot. Guitarist Powell stated the importance of the Llangollen performances, as North Wales was the first place where the crowd had sung along to their songs. Matthews added that Margam Park was chosen as no-one had ever held a concert there before.

Catatonia supported R.E.M. on two European dates in June; there was an incident at Kindl-Bühne Wuhlheide, Berlin, when Matthews ran on the stage during the R.E.M. performance to kiss bassist Mike Mills. It was later attributed to her having drunk a bottle of wine. The band had wanted to release &quot;Karaoke Queen&quot; as the second single off the album, but the record label forced them to release &quot;Londinium&quot; instead. Matthews was also equally angry that the cost for the video for the single was higher than the cost to produce the entire album. A month later, Barry Cawley, who had been a roadie for the band since it originally formed, was killed in a road accident in North Wales. Cawley had been cycling when he was killed by a driver in a Fiat Punto. Roberts explained prior to the funeral that the roadie had helped keep Matthews&#x27; &quot;feet on the ground&quot;.

The band attempted to break into the United States once more with &quot;Equally Cursed and Blessed&quot;. The album release included two tracks from &quot;International Velvet&quot;, including &quot;Road Rage&quot;. They had been scheduled to make appearances on American television shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and conduct interviews with the media. But after drummer Richards was taken to hospital in the UK with appendicitis, it was abandoned and the rest of the band returned to the UK. Richards had remained in the UK and was due to join them a day and a half later. Rumours began to appear in the press that the band was about to break up, but a band spokesman stated that the intention was to return to the States later in the year. Performances did take place in Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

===&quot;Paper Scissors Stone&quot; and dissolution (2001)===
The band took a break from performing live between the NetAid charity concert in October 1999 and 2001. They returned to the stage for a further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison&#x27;s campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that &quot;It&#x27;s a cause I think&#x27;s really important and it just seemed to be the right time for us to come back – it&#x27;s a long, long time since we played live. It should be really great. We&#x27;re really looking forward to what they (the new songs) are going to sound like live. It&#x27;ll be good to get back on the old live circuit again.&quot; They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled &quot;It&#x27;s What&#x27;s Not There That Makes What&#x27;s There What It Is&quot;. By May, it had been renamed to &quot;Paper Scissors Stone&quot;. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to &quot;NME&quot; that &quot;I think it&#x27;s stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It&#x27;s a bit less stupid. [&quot;Equally Cursed and Blessed&quot;] was all over the shop stylistically, I think it&#x27;s a bit more focused. And I think it&#x27;s a bit more impassioned&quot;.

Catatonia went on to headline the &quot;NME&quot; stage at the T in the Park festival on 7 July, having conducted a warm up concert at The Lighthouse, Glasgow. The lead single from the new album, &quot;Stone by Stone&quot;, was poorly received by the media with &quot;NME&quot; giving it a score of one out of ten, calling it &quot;lumpen, the voice grating&quot; and that Catatonia are &quot;fading from the public consciousness quicker than Shane Ritchie&quot; and &quot;awkwardly out of date&quot;. On the other hand, Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; felt the song is the &quot;closest they come&quot; to a hook &quot;as memorable as&quot; their erstwhile hits.

The media reported that Matthews entered drug rehabilitation for drinking and smoking in mid-2001, with the singer stating that she was also suffering from depression. As a result, the tour to support &quot;Paper Scissors Stone&quot; was cancelled at the start of August. At the time this was because Matthews had not yet finished her &quot;ongoing treatment for anxiety and exhaustion&quot;. It was suggested that the band might split up in August, which was dismissed as &quot;rubbish&quot; by Catatonia. However, on 21 September it was announced that they were breaking up with the record label releasing a statement which said &quot;Their decision has been made entirely amicably, and there are no details at present as to their future plan&quot;.

Tributes came in for the band from a variety of sources, with BBC Radio 1 presenter Huw Stephens describing them as &quot;international superstars&quot;, and adding &quot;I always thought they were one of the best Welsh bands. They were not just a throwaway pop band – they had real, meaningful songs.&quot; Iestyn George, editor of the magazine &quot;Maxim&quot; at the time, praised the influence that Matthews had through Catatonia in the later 1990s, saying that &quot;Around 1998 and 1999, Cerys was in the papers every other day&quot;. He also referenced that she had never intended this role as Catatonia had thought that they had already peaked prior to &quot;International Velvet&quot;.

===Post-dissolution (2002–present)===
Matthews went on to release her first solo album, &quot;Cockahoop&quot;, in May 2003. Her second album &quot;Never Said Goodbye&quot; was released in August 2006. In November 2007 she released a mini-album of Welsh language songs &quot;Awyren=Aeroplane&quot; on the My Kung Fu label. Matthews returned in late 2009 by releasing albums simultaneously in both Welsh and English (&quot;Paid Edrych I Lawr&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Down&quot;, respectively).
Her next album Explorer released in 2011 inbetween the release of two Welsh cover albums TIR in 2010 &amp; Hullabaloo in 2013.
Powell has gone on to write songs, including for Duffy, and from 2007 onwards has presented a Welsh language show on Radio Cymru. He also replaced drummer Stuart Cable from the Stereophonics, following his death, in the supergroup The Stand. They released a charity single in 2010 to fund construction of a statue of Welsh footballer Fred Keenor in Cardiff city centre.

On 17 April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Matthews confirmed that Catatonia were aiming to take part in a #timslisteningparty for &quot;International Velvet&quot;. A date was announced, but postponed due to an unspecified problem with either Matthews&#x27; or Roberts&#x27;s internet connection. The party remained on timstwitterlisteningparty.com as an upcoming event until the autumn of 2020, when all reference to it was removed. Matthews did appear as a guest on &quot;Tim Burgess&#x27; Listening Party&quot; radio show on Absolute Radio in 2023, where the album was played in its entirety, marking its 25th anniversary.

On 3 June 2023, Matthews announced on Twitter that a new retrospective collection of music titled &quot;Make Hay Not War: The Blanco Y Negro Years&quot; would be released by Cherry Red Records.

==Side projects and collaborations==
While working on &quot;International Velvet&quot;, Matthews was approached by Tommy Scott of the Liverpool-based band Space to perform on the single duet &quot;The Ballad of Tom Jones&quot;. They had met while on tour two years prior and had kept in touch. She joined them on tour for several dates to sing the duet live. Matthews said of the song, &quot;It&#x27;s great. I feel like Nancy Sinatra because it&#x27;s a superb ballad.&quot; She went on to duet with Tom Jones on a single for his album &quot;Reload&quot;. It was a cover of the song &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot;, which was released as a Christmas single in 1999. She was credited as &quot;Cerys from Catatonia&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
Matthews said that they did not have any particular influences in their music. However, she said that her family had always been singing along to BBC Radio 2. She held the ambition to have the band appear on Radio 2, as due to poor levels of radio reception in Wales they had been unable to listen to other stations. She attributed the style of Welsh music as never attempting to be cool as they would not have been aware of what was in fashion at the time. Catatonia frequently used metaphors in their songwriting, such as &quot;Road Rage&quot; which references emotional anger. The line &quot;If it turns to blue, what are we going to do?&quot; in the single &quot;You&#x27;ve Got A Lot To Answer For&quot; from &quot;Way Beyond Blue&quot; references a pregnancy test. Other works from &quot;International Velvet&quot; were compared to poetry by Katharine Viner in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

All members of the band were involved in the writing of songs, and there may have been more than one person&#x27;s set of lyrics appearing in a single release. Powell said that &quot;It&#x27;s quite interesting to have two people&#x27;s viewpoints within the same song. I&#x27;m not sure how many bands actually do that. In most bands, the guitarist writes the music and the singer writes the lyrics. We tend to share things out more evenly.&quot; He also criticised the attachment of an indie pop label to the band, saying &quot;We&#x27;re seen as one of the indie bands. But we&#x27;ve always just tried to make pop music. Even if it is pop music with a hard edge and quite a twisted little view of life. We&#x27;ve always seen ourselves as a little bigger than an indie band.&quot;

The style of music played by Catatonia changed slightly over time. An article in &quot;The People&quot; newspaper described &quot;International Velvet&quot; as the &quot;purest pop&quot;. By the time that &quot;Paper Scissors Stone&quot; was released, the band were using country music influences in some of their songs according to Fiona Shepherd at &quot;The Scotsman&quot;. She compared the music to that of the Scottish band Mogwai, while elements of &quot;Nightfall&quot; were compared to Arab Strap.

<doc id="53513" wikidata="Q1111484" url="?curid=53513" title="Paper Scissors Stone (album)">
<text>Paper Scissors Stone was the fourth and final album by Welsh band Catatonia. It was released on 6 August 2001 in the UK, and reached #6 on the UK album chart.

==Background==
The album only had one single taken from it, &quot;Stone by Stone&quot; – the group&#x27;s final single release. Fittingly, the ending of the video for the song features the band members all abandoning their instruments and walking away. The band had announced on their website that the next single was to be the rocky &quot;Is Everybody Here on Drugs&quot;, although the announcement was quickly removed once it was clear that Catatonia were about to put an end to the band.

The band were unable to promote the album, albeit with the exception of an appearance on &quot;Later...with Jools Holland&quot; and a few performances of &quot;Stone by Stone&quot;, as Cerys Matthews was being treated for alcohol addiction and nervous exhaustion. The band had to cancel their upcoming eight venue UK tour which was due to take place during September due to ongoing concerns with Matthews&#x27; recovery. A statement by the record label Warners said that Matthews would not have &quot;recovered sufficiently&quot; from her treatment for &quot;anxiety and exhaustion.&quot;

The album&#x27;s cover and in-sleeve photos were taken from the film, &quot;Tiger Bay&quot;, which starred Hayley Mills. Hayley was given a thank-you in the album. The album was dedicated to close friend and roadie Barry Cawley, who was killed in a road accident on his bicycle in Betws-y-Coed, North Wales in July 2000. The track, &quot;Imaginary Friend&quot;, was written about him. The album title refers to the game rock paper scissors.

==Reception==
Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; noted a feeling within some of the album&#x27;s lyrics and song titles such as &quot;Is Everybody Here on Drugs?&quot;, which felt like they mirrored her actual life. Gill commented: &quot;Cerys&#x27;s boozing is, on this showing, the least of the band&#x27;s problems. More pressing, surely, is the glaring absence of a hook as memorable as &#x27;Road Rage&#x27; or &#x27;Mulder &amp; Scully&#x27;; the closest they come here is the single &#x27;Stone by Stone&#x27;.&quot; Caroline Sullivan in &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that &quot;[Matthews] will always be an acquired taste, one that depends wholly on the strength of the songs. Ideally suited to pub singalongs, her warble is done justice by festival anthems such as Road Rage, but when pitted against anything heavy or balladish it tends to grate relentlessly.&quot; She also praised the single &quot;Stone by Stone&quot;, saying it &quot;gets it right.&quot; She concluded: &quot;on balance it comes down to loving or hating that voice.&quot;
In 2006, Iain Forrester of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; said the album &quot;certainly doesn’t deserve any of the hatred it received in the press at the time. It has a fire to match their debut and a much wider musical scope, taking in the string-laden melodrama of &#x27;Godspeed&#x27; (which certainly suits Cerys Matthews&#x27; bellowing vocals) and flirtations with dance on &#x27;What It Is,&#x27; as well as rock blasts like &#x27;Immediate Circle&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="53514" wikidata="Q237564" url="?curid=53514" title="Edith Cavell">
<text>Edith Louisa Cavell ( ; 4 December 1865 – 12 October 1915) was a British nurse. She is celebrated for treating wounded soldiers from both sides without discrimination during the First World War and for helping some 200 Allied soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium and return to active service through the spy ring known as &quot;La Dame Blanche&quot;. Cavell was arrested, convicted following court-martial under German military law of violating medical neutrality, and sentenced to death by firing squad. Despite international pressure for mercy, General Traugott von Sauberzweig, the military governor of Brussels, refused to commute her sentence. The night before her execution, Cavell said, &quot;Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone&quot;. She was executed the next morning in the presence of Imperial German Army medic and war poet Gottfried Benn. Cavell, who was 49 at the time of her death, was already notable as a pioneer of modern nursing in Belgium.

Unlike the subsequent execution by the French Army of two German Red Cross nurses, also for smuggling escaped POWs through the lines, Cavell&#x27;s trial and execution received worldwide condemnation and extensive press coverage. In response, Kaiser Wilhelm II decreed that no more women were to be executed by the German military without his express permission.

Cavell&#x27;s words on the night before her death were inscribed on the Edith Cavell Memorial opposite the entrance to the National Portrait Gallery near Trafalgar Square. Her deeply Christian beliefs propelled Cavell to help all those who needed it, including both German and Allied soldiers. She was quoted as saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t stop while there are lives to be saved.&quot; The Church of England commemorates her in its Calendar of Saints on 12 October.

==Early life and career==
Cavell was born on 4 December 1865 in Swardeston, a village near Norwich, where her father was vicar for 45 years. She was the eldest of the four children of the Reverend Frederick Cavell (1824–1910) and his wife Louisa Sophia Warming (1835–1918). Edith&#x27;s siblings were Florence Mary (1867-1950), Mary Lilian (1870-1967) and John Frederick Scott (1872–1923).

Cavell was educated at Norwich High School for Girls, then at boarding schools in Clevedon, Somerset, and Peterborough (Laurel Court).

After a period as a governess, including for a family in Brussels from 1890 to 1895, Cavell returned home to care for her father during a serious illness. The experience led her to become a nurse after her father&#x27;s recovery. Cavell worked as a nurse at the Fountain Fever Hospital in Tooting from December 1895. At the age of 30, Cavell applied to become a nurse probationer at the London Hospital and commenced as a regular probationer at the London Hospital in September 1896 under Matron Eva Luckes. Cavell was seconded to work with other London Hospital nurses in the Maidstone typhoid epidemic, from 15 October 1897 until early January 1898, while still a probationer. Along with other staff, she was awarded the Maidstone Typhoid Medal. After her training, Cavell worked from October 1898 to December 1899 as a private nurse employed by the Private Nursing Institution of the London Hospital, treating patients in their homes. Cavell travelled to tend patients with cancer, gout, pneumonia, pleurisy, eye issues and appendicitis. In 1901, Luckes recommended Cavell for the position of night superintendent of St Pancras Infirmary. In November 1903, she became assistant matron of St Leonard&#x27;s Infirmary in Shoreditch.

In 1906, Cavell took a temporary post as matron of the Manchester and Salford Sick and Poor and Private Nursing Institution, working there for about nine months.

==Work in Belgium==
In 1907, Cavell was recruited by Dr. Antoine Depage, the Belgian royal surgeon, and the founder and president of the Belgian Red Cross, to be matron of a newly established nursing school, L&#x27;École Belge d&#x27;Infirmières Diplômées (or the Berkendael Medical Institute) on the Rue de la Culture (now Rue Franz Merjay), in Ixelles, Brussels. By 1910, &quot;Miss Cavell &#x27;felt that the profession of nursing had gained sufficient foothold in Belgium to warrant the publishing of a professional journal&#x27; and launched the nursing journal, &quot;L&#x27;infirmière&quot;&quot;. Within a year, she was training nurses for three hospitals, twenty-four schools, and thirteen kindergartens in Belgium.

Cavell was offered a position as matron in a Brussels clinic. She worked closely with Depage, who was part of a &quot;growing body of people&quot; in the medical profession in Belgium. He realised that the care that was being provided by the religious institutions had not been keeping up with medical advances. In 1910, Cavell was asked if she would be the matron for the new secular hospital at Saint-Gilles.

When the First World War broke out, Cavell was visiting her widowed mother in Norfolk. She returned to Brussels, where her clinic and nursing school were taken over by the Red Cross.

==Assistance to Allied soldiers==

In November 1914, after the German occupation of Brussels, Cavell began sheltering British soldiers and funnelling them out of occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands. Wounded British and French soldiers as well as Belgian and French civilians of military age were hidden from the Germans and provided with false papers by Prince Réginald de Croÿ at his château of Bellignies near Mons. From there, they were conducted by various guides to the houses of Cavell, Louis Séverin, and others in Brussels, where their hosts would furnish them with money to reach the Dutch frontier, and provide them with guides obtained through Philippe Baucq. This placed Cavell in violation of German military law. German authorities became increasingly suspicious of the nurse&#x27;s actions, which were further fuelled by her outspokenness.

===Arrest and trial===
Cavell was arrested on 3 August 1915 and charged with harbouring Allied soldiers. She had been betrayed by Georges Gaston Quien, who was later convicted by a French court as a collaborator. Cavell was held in Saint-Gilles prison for ten weeks, the last two of which were spent in solitary confinement. She made three depositions to the German police (on 8, 18 and 22 August), admitting that she had been instrumental in conveying about 60 British and 15 French soldiers, as well as about 100 French and Belgian civilians of military age, to the frontier and had sheltered most of them in her house.

At her court-martial, Cavell was prosecuted for aiding British and French soldiers, and young Belgian men, to cross the Dutch border and eventually enter Britain. She admitted her guilt when she signed a statement the day before the trial. Cavell declared that the soldiers she had helped escape thanked her in writing when they arrived safely in Britain. This admission confirmed that Cavell had not only helped the soldiers navigate the Dutch frontier, but it also established that she helped them escape to a country at war with Germany. Her fellow defendants included Prince Reginald&#x27;s sister, Princess Marie of Croÿ.

The penalty, according to German military law, was death. Paragraph 58 of the German Military Code determined that &quot;In time of war, anyone who, with the intention of aiding a hostile power, or of causing harm to German or allied troops&quot;, commits any of the crimes defined in paragraph 90 of the German Penal Code &quot;shall be punished with death for war treason&quot;. Specifically, Cavell was charged under paragraph 90 (1) no. 3 &quot;Reichsstrafgesetzbuch&quot;, for &quot;conveying troops to the enemy&quot;, a crime normally punishable by life imprisonment in peacetime. It was possible to charge Cavell with perfidy, or war treason (), as paragraph 160 of the German Military Code extended application of paragraph 58 to foreigners &quot;present in the zone of war&quot;.
While the First Geneva Convention ordinarily guaranteed protection of medical personnel, such protection was forfeit if medical practices were seen to be used as cover for belligerent action. This forfeiture is expressed in article 7 of the 1906 version of the convention, which was the version in force at the time, and justified prosecution under German military law.

The British government could therefore do nothing to help her. Sir Horace Rowland of the Foreign Office said, &quot;I am afraid that it is likely to go hard with Miss Cavell; I am afraid we are powerless.&quot; Lord Robert Cecil, Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, advised that, &quot;Any representation by us will do her more harm than good.&quot; The United States, however, had not yet joined the war and was in a position to apply diplomatic pressure. Hugh S. Gibson, Secretary to the U.S. Legation at Brussels, made clear to the German government that executing Cavell would further harm Germany&#x27;s already damaged reputation. Later, he wrote:

Baron von der Lancken is known to have stated that Cavell should be pardoned because of her complete honesty and because she had helped save so many lives, German as well as Allied. However, General von Sauberzweig, the military governor of Brussels, ordered that &quot;in the interests of the State&quot; the implementation of the death penalty against Baucq and Cavell should be immediate, denying higher authorities an opportunity to consider clemency. Cavell was represented by defence lawyer Sadi Kirschen from Brussels. Of the twenty-seven defendants, five were condemned to death: Cavell, Baucq (an architect in his thirties), Louise Thuliez, Séverin and Countess Jeanne de Belleville. Of the five sentenced to death, only Cavell and Baucq were executed; the other three were granted reprieves.

Cavell was arrested not for espionage, as many were led to believe, but for &quot;war treason&quot;, despite not being a German national. She may have been recruited by the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), and turned away from her espionage duties in order to help Allied soldiers escape, although this is not widely accepted. Rankin cites the published statement of M. R. D. Foot, historian and Second World War British intelligence officer, as to Cavell having been part of SIS or MI6. The former director-general of MI5, Stella Rimington, announced in 2015 that she had unearthed documents in Belgian military archives that confirmed an intelligence-gathering aspect to Cavell&#x27;s network. The BBC Radio 4 programme that presented Rimington&#x27;s quote, noted Cavell&#x27;s use of secret codes and, though amateurish, other network members&#x27; successful transmission of intelligence.

When in custody, Cavell was questioned in French, but her trial was minuted in German; which some assert gave the prosecutor the opportunity to misinterpret her answers. Although she may have been misrepresented, she made no attempt to defend herself, but responded to have channelled &quot;environ deux cents&quot; (&quot;about two hundred&quot;) soldiers to the Dutch border. Cavell was provided with a defender approved by the German military governor; a previous defender, who was chosen for Cavell by her assistant, Elizabeth Wilkins, was ultimately rejected by the governor.

===Execution===
The night before her execution, Cavell told the Reverend H. Stirling Gahan, the Anglican chaplain of Christ Church Brussels, who had been allowed to see her and to give her Holy Communion, &quot;I am thankful to have had these ten weeks of quiet to get ready. Now I have had them and have been kindly treated here. I expected my sentence and I believe it was just. Standing as I do in view of God and Eternity, I realise that patriotism is not enough, I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.&quot; These words are inscribed on her statues in London and in Melbourne, Australia. Cavell&#x27;s final words to the German Lutheran prison chaplain, Paul Le Seur, were recorded as, &quot;Ask Father Gahan to tell my loved ones later on that my soul, as I believe, is safe, and that I am glad to die for my country.&quot;

From his sick bed, Brand Whitlock, the U.S. ambassador to Belgium, wrote a personal note on Cavell&#x27;s behalf to Moritz von Bissing, the Governor-General of Belgium. Hugh Gibson; Maitre G. de Leval, the legal adviser to the United States legation; and , 2nd Marques de Villalobar, the Spanish minister, formed a midnight deputation of appeal for mercy or at least postponement of execution. Despite these efforts, on 11 October, Baron von der Lancken allowed the execution to proceed. Sixteen men, forming two firing squads, carried out the sentence pronounced on her and on four Belgian men at the Tir national shooting range in Schaerbeek, at 7:00am on 12 October 1915. There are conflicting reports of the details of Cavell&#x27;s execution. However, according to the eyewitness account of the Reverend Le Seur, who attended Cavell in her final hours, eight soldiers fired at Cavell while the other eight executed Baucq. Her execution, certification of death, and burial were witnessed by the German war poet Gottfried Benn in his capacity as a &#x27;Senior Doctor in the Brussels Government since the first days of the (German) occupation&#x27;. Benn wrote a detailed account titled &quot;Wie Miss Cavell erschossen wurde&quot; (&quot;How Miss Cavell was shot&quot;, 1928).

There is also a dispute over the sentencing imposed under the German Military Code. Supposedly, the death penalty relevant to the offence committed by Cavell was not officially declared until a few hours after her death. The British post-war Committee of Enquiry into Breaches of the Laws of War however regarded the verdict as legally correct.

On instructions from the Spanish minister, Belgian women immediately buried Cavell&#x27;s body next to Saint-Gilles Prison. After the war, her body was taken back to Britain for a memorial service at Westminster Abbey and then transferred to Norwich, to be laid to rest at Life&#x27;s Green on the east side of the cathedral. The King had to grant an exception to an Order in Council of 1854, which prevented any burials in the grounds of the cathedral, to allow the reburial.

==International reaction==


In the months and years following Cavell&#x27;s death, countless newspaper articles, pamphlets, images, and books publicised her story. She became an iconic propaganda figure for military recruitment in Britain, and to help increase favourable sentiment towards the Allies in the United States. Along with the invasion of Belgium, and the sinking of the &quot;Lusitania&quot;, Cavell&#x27;s execution was widely publicised in both Britain and North America by Wellington House, the British War Propaganda Bureau. She was a popular icon because of her sex, her nursing profession, and her apparently heroic approach to death. Her execution was represented as an act of German barbarism and moral depravity - very much at variance with Cavell&#x27;s own clearly stated wish to have &quot;no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.&quot;

News reports shortly after Cavell&#x27;s execution were found to be only true in part. Even the &quot;American Journal of Nursing&quot; repeated the fictional account of Cavell&#x27;s execution in which she fainted and fell because of her refusal to wear a blindfold in front of the firing squad. Allegedly, while she lay unconscious, the German commanding officer shot her dead with a revolver.

Because of the British Government&#x27;s decision to publicise Cavell&#x27;s story as part of its propaganda effort, she became the most prominent British female casualty of the First World War. The combination of heroic appeal and a resonant atrocity-story narrative made Cavell&#x27;s case one of the most effective in British propaganda of the First World War.

Before the First World War, Cavell was not well known outside nursing circles. This allowed two different depictions of the truth about her in British propaganda, which were a reply to enemy attempts to justify her shooting, including the suggestion that Cavell, during her interrogation, had given information that incriminated others. In November 1915, the British Foreign Office issued a denial that Cavell had implicated anyone else in her testimony.

One image commonly represented was of Cavell as an innocent victim of a ruthless and dishonourable enemy. This view depicted her as having helped Allied soldiers to escape, but innocent of &#x27;espionage&#x27;, and was most commonly used in various forms of British propaganda, such as postcards and newspaper illustrations during the war. Her story was presented in the British press as a means of fuelling a desire for revenge on the battlefield. These images implied that men must enlist in the armed forces immediately in order to stop forces that could arrange the judicial murder of an innocent British woman.

Another representation of a side of Cavell during the First World War saw her described as a serious, reserved, brave, and patriotic woman who devoted her life to nursing and died to save others. This portrayal has been illustrated in numerous biographical sources, from personal first-hand experiences of the Red Cross nurse. Pastor Le Seur, the German army chaplain, recalled at the time of her execution, &quot;I do not believe that Miss Cavell wanted to be a martyr... but she was ready to die for her country... Miss Cavell was a very brave woman and a faithful Christian&quot;. Another account from Anglican chaplain, the Reverend Gahan, remembers Cavell&#x27;s words, &quot;I have no fear or shrinking; I have seen death so often it is not strange, or fearful to me!&quot; In this interpretation, her stoicism was seen as remarkable for a non-combatant woman, and brought her even greater renown than a man in similar circumstances would have received.

===German justification===
The Imperial German Government thought that it had acted fairly towards Cavell. In a letter, German Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, Alfred Zimmermann (not to be confused with Arthur Zimmermann, German Secretary for Foreign Affairs) made a statement to the press on behalf of the German government:

From the perspective of the German government, had it released Cavell there might have been a surge in the number of women participating in acts against Germany because they knew they would not be severely punished. It took the view that it was up to the responsible men to follow their legal duty to Germany and ignore the world&#x27;s condemnation. Its laws did not make distinctions between sexes; the only exception to this being that, according to legal customs, women in a &quot;delicate&quot; (probably this means &quot;pregnant&quot;) condition should not be executed. However, in January 1916, the Kaiser decreed that, from then on, capital punishment should not be carried out on women without his explicit prior endorsement.

The German government also believed that all of the convicted people were thoroughly aware of the nature of their acts. The court paid particular attention to this point, releasing several people because there was doubt as to whether the accused knew that their actions were punishable. The condemned, in contrast, knew full well what they were doing and the punishment for committing their crimes because &quot;numerous public proclamations had pointed out the fact that aiding enemies’ armies was punishable with death.&quot;

==Repatriation and burial==


Cavell&#x27;s remains were returned to Britain after the war, sailing from Ostend aboard the destroyer HMS &quot;Rowena&quot; and landing at Admiralty Pier in Dover on 14 May 1919. Cavell&#x27;s was one of only three sets of British remains repatriated following the end of the War, the others being Charles Fryatt and The Unknown Warrior. As the ship arrived, a full peal of Grandsire Triples (5040 Changes, Parker&#x27;s Twelve-Part) was rung on the bells of St Mary&#x27;s Church in the town. A plaque commemorating the peal in the church&#x27;s bell-ringing chamber states it was &quot;Rung with the bells deeply muffled with the exception of the Tenor which was open at back stroke, in token of respect to Nurse Cavell.” Deep (or full) muffling is normally only used for the deaths of sovereigns. All the ringers were former soldiers, including Frederick W Elliot, formerly King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, who had been a prisoner of war in Germany for eight months.

Her body was transferred to a railway van and lay in state on the pier overnight before departing from Dover Harbour station for London Victoria station. Becoming known as the Cavell Van, that van is kept as a memorial on the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway and is usually open to view at Bodiam railway station, though during October 2015 it was placed on display outside the Forum, Norwich. From Victoria the body was processed to Westminster Abbey for a state funeral on 15 May, before finally being reburied at the east side of Norwich Cathedral on 19 May, where a graveside service is still held each October.

==Memorials==

Following Cavell&#x27;s death, many memorials were created around the world to remember her.

* In the Church of England&#x27;s calendar of saints, the day appointed for the commemoration of Cavell is 12 October. This is a memorial in her honour rather than formal canonisation, and so not a &quot;saint&#x27;s feast day&quot; in the traditional sense.
* In 2022, Cavell was officially added to the United States Episcopal Church liturgical calendar with a feast day on 12 October.

===Films, plays and television===

* The first film made of Cavell&#x27;s life story was the 1916 Australian silent film &quot;The Martyrdom of Nurse Cavell&quot; soon followed by &quot;Nurse Cavell&quot; later the same year.
* In 1918 John G. Adolfi directed &quot;The Woman the Germans Shot&quot;, starring Julia Arthur as Cavell
* In 1925 Eva Elwes wrote a play &quot;Edith Cavell, Nurse and Martyr&quot;. It was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain after consultation with Cavell&#x27;s sisters. After changes to the title and characters the play was granted a licence as &quot;The Price She Paid&quot; and performed in 1927. 
* Herbert Wilcox made a 1928 silent film called &quot;Dawn&quot; with Sybil Thorndike. He remade it as &quot;Nurse Edith Cavell&quot; (1939) starring Anna Neagle and George Sanders.
* &quot;Nurse Cavell&quot;, a play in three acts, by C. S. Forester with C. E. Bechhofer Roberts opened at the Vaudeville Theatre in London on 7 March 1934, where it ran for 34 performances. The play had first been performed at the Q Theatre in the suburbs.
* In the second episode of the 1980 television series &quot;To Serve Them All My Days&quot;, Cavell is mentioned in a speech to the school&#x27;s Officers&#x27; Training Corps.
* In &quot;Les plus grands Belges&quot; (&quot;The Greatest Belgians&quot;), a 2005 television show on the Belgian French-speaking public channel RTBF, the audience voted Cavell the 48th-greatest Belgian.
* In the final episode of the 2014 BBC drama series &quot;The Crimson Field&quot;, Cavell is mentioned as having been executed, during the interrogation of Sister Joan Livesey.
* &quot;Patriot&quot;, a play by Angela Moffat, premiered at the Grand Theatre Arts Wing, Swansea in October 2014 with Claire Novelli appearing as Cavell. It was produced by Fluellen Theatre Company.

===Music===
* &quot;Edith Cavell&quot; is the third and final opera by Maltese composer Paolino Vassallo (1856–1923). A melodrama in three acts to a libretto by Alfonso Giglio, it received its première at the Royal Opera House, Valletta, Malta, on 21 March 1927, four years after Vassallo&#x27;s death, and was an immediate success.
* The song &quot;Saint Stephen&#x27;s End&quot; by the Felice Brothers from their 2008 album &quot;The Felice Brothers&quot; includes a verse about the death of Cavell.
* The song &quot;Amy Quartermaine&quot; by Manning from the 2011 album &quot;Margaret&#x27;s Children&quot; is also based on the life of Cavell.
* The song &quot;Que Sera&quot; on the album &quot;Silent June&quot; by O&#x27;Hooley &amp; Tidow was inspired by the execution of Cavell.
* A patriotic song, &quot;Remember Nurse Cavell&quot; (words by Gordon V. Thompson, music by Jules Brazil) appeared with 1915 British copyright.
* The 2024 song &quot;Portraits of Edith Cavell&quot; by British composer Ryan Linham was commissioned in 2023 by the PTC Record Label and Samantha Barnhart. The piece was commissioned as an effort to further Edith&#x27;s legacy of heroism and highlight a female historical figure from a time when women around the world were making an impact through service and dedication, but might not have been given the acknowledgement or place in history that they deserved. The song&#x27;s various movements each depict a part of Edith&#x27;s unique life through the lens of some of her strongest qualities including service, purpose, dedication, and passion.

===Centenary===

Although the centenary of her death was in 2015, she was also remembered by three new musical pieces in 2014 during commemorations of the outbreak of World War One - 
* &quot;Standing as I do before God&quot; by Cecilia McDowall - an &quot;a cappella&quot; choral setting of the last reported words of Cavell for soprano solo and five-part choir.
* &quot;The Scarlet Flower&quot; by Nigel Clarke - a Concertino for Flugelhorn &amp; Strings recorded on Toccata Classics by Longbow String Ensemble.
* &quot;An Epitaph for Edith Cavell&quot; by Nigel Clarke - a solo violin piece recorded on Toccata Classics by Peter Sheppard Skaerved.

To commemorate the centenary of her death in 2015, work went ahead to restore Cavell&#x27;s grave in the grounds of Norwich Cathedral after being awarded a £50,000 grant and was completed in 2016. and fourteen paintings by Brian Whelan were commissioned by Norwich Cathedral to commemorate Cavell&#x27;s life and death. Norwich Cathedral held a memorial service, performed live on BBC Radio 4 on 11 October 2015. In addition to cathedral clergy, guests such as General Richard Dannatt, and actress Matilda Ziegler performed various spoken vignettes organised by Canon Peter Doll. Anto Morra sang unaccompanied his &quot;Edith Louisa Cavell&quot; lyrics to a tune written by Percy Paradise.

The centenary was also marked by two new musical compositions. The 40-minute oratorio &quot;Eventide: In Memoriam Edith Cavell&quot; by Patrick Hawes premiered in Norwich Cathedral in July 2014 and had its London premiere in St Clement Danes, The Strand, London on 12 October 2015, the exact centenary of her death. The Belgian Edith Cavell Commemoration Group also commissioned a 20-minute-long setting of the Latin Mass by David Mitchell for the centenary - it premiered in Holy Trinity Pro-Cathedral, Brussels on 10 October 2015, in the same choir stalls where Cavell sang in 1915, with Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Missa in Angustiis&quot; also performed at the same concert.

Cavell was featured on a UK commemorative £5 coin, part of a set issued in 2015 by the Royal Mint to mark the centenary of the war. On 12 October that year a bust in the Montjoiepark in Uccle, Belgium, was inaugurated by Princess Anne, Princess Royal of Great Britain and Princess Astrid of Belgium. 2015 also saw a tombstone-shaped monument erected in the memorial garden dedicated to her in Inverness.

On the centenary of her execution, an event funded by the University of Salford took place at Sacred Trinity where historian Sir Ian Kershaw and Christine Hallett of the UK Centre for the History of Nursing and Midwifery, spoke.

The memorial on her grave was renewed in 2016. On 4 December 2018 a Google Doodle was created to celebrate her 153rd birthday. The centenary of her repatriation in May 2019 was marked by another half-muffled peal of bells at St Martin&#x27;s Church in Dover.

<text>The Patchwork Girl of Oz is the seventh book in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Oz series. Characters include the Woozy, Ojo &quot;the Unlucky&quot;, Unc Nunkie, Dr. Pipt, Scraps (the patchwork girl), and others. The novel was first published on July 1, 1913, with illustrations by John R. Neill. In 1914, Baum adapted the book to film through his Oz Film Manufacturing Company. The book was followed by &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914).

In the previous Oz book, &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, magic was used to isolate Oz from all contact with the outside world. Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart the series with this book due to financial hardship. In the prologue, he reconciles Oz&#x27;s isolation with the appearance of a new Oz book by explaining that he contacted Dorothy in Oz via a wireless telegraph, and she obtained Ozma&#x27;s permission to tell Baum this story.

==Plot==
Ojo, known as Ojo the Unlucky, lives in poverty with his laconic uncle Unc Nunkie in the woods of the Munchkin Country in Oz. They visit their neighbor, the magician Dr. Pipt who is about to complete the six-year process of preparing the magical Powder of Life, which can bring inanimate objects to life. Pipt&#x27;s wife has constructed a life-sized stuffed girl out of patchwork, and she wishes her husband to animate her to serve as an obedient household servant. They also meet another of Pipt&#x27;s creations, Bungle, an extremely vain talking cat made of glass. The Powder of Life successfully animates the patchwork girl, but an accident causes both Pipt&#x27;s wife and Unc Nunkie to be turned to stone. Dr. Pipt tells Ojo that he must obtain five ingredients to make a compound to counteract the petrifaction spell.

Ojo and the patchwork girl (who names herself Scraps), along with Bungle, embark on a journey to obtain the magic ingredients: a six-leaved clover, the wing of a yellow butterfly, water from a dark well, a drop of oil from a live man&#x27;s body, and three hairs from a Woozy&#x27;s tail. Scraps exhibits a wild, carefree personality, and she is prone to spontaneous recitation of nonsense poetry. After several adventures, they meet a Woozy, a blocky quadruped who agrees to let them have three hairs from its tail—but they are unable to remove the hairs, so they take the Woozy along with them.

The party is captured by large animate plants, but they are rescued by the fortuitous arrival of the Shaggy Man. He leads them to the Emerald City to meet Princess Ozma, but warns Ojo that picking a six-leaved clover is forbidden by law in Oz. Along the way they meet the Scarecrow, who is quite smitten with Scraps, as she is with him. Just outside the Emerald City, Ojo sees a six-leaved clover by the road and, believing himself to be unobserved, picks it. When they arrive at the city gates, the Soldier with the Green Whiskers approaches them and announces that Ojo is under arrest.

Brought to trial before Ozma, Ojo confesses and Ozma pardons him and allows him to keep the clover. Dorothy and the Scarecrow join Ojo and Scraps as they continue their search for the remaining ingredients. Along the way they meet Jack Pumpkinhead, the playful but annoying Tottenhots, and the man-eating 21-foot-tall giant Mr. Yoop, before reaching the subterranean dwellings of the Hoppers, who each have just one leg, and the neighboring Horners, who each have one horn on their head. The two groups are on the verge of war due to a misunderstanding, but Scraps reconciles them. A grateful Horner leads the group to a well in a dark radium mine, and Ojo collects a flask of water from it.

The group continues to the castle of the Tin Woodsman who rules the Winkie Country, since yellow butterflies can be found only in that yellow-dominated quadrant of Oz. While talking to the Tin Woodsman, Ojo notices a drop of oil about to drip from his body, and he catches it in a vial. He explains that he now has all the ingredients except one; however, when he describes the last one, the Tin Woodsman is horrified at the idea of killing an innocent butterfly, and forbids them from doing so in his realm. Ojo is devastated, but the Tin Woodsman proposes that they all travel back to the Emerald City to ask Ozma&#x27;s advice.

Ozma tells them that Dr. Pipt has been practicing magic illegally and has therefore been deprived of his powers. But the petrified Unc Nunkie and Pipt&#x27;s wife have been brought to the Emerald City and, as they all watch, the Wizard of Oz restores them to life. Ojo and Unc Nunkie are given a new house to live in near the Emerald City and the Tin Woodsman renames Ojo &quot;Ojo the Lucky&quot;.

==Principal character==
Scraps is a living rag doll made of patchwork, button eyes, brown yarn hair, a felt tongue, and pearl teeth. She was originally brought to life by a Munchkin magician named Dr. Pipt by means of his Powder of Life formula to be a servant for his wife Margolotte. Ojo overloaded her with magic brains in the process of bringing her to life, and as she happily jumped around she accidentally spilled the Liquid of Petrifaction on Mrs. Pipt and Ojo&#x27;s uncle, consequently turning them to stone. Much of their first adventure is gathering the ingredients to find a counterspell. She later became the companion of the Scarecrow who found her quite beautiful.

The character had significant roles in such Oz books as &quot;The Gnome King of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Wonder City of Oz&quot;, and was the title character in &quot;A Runaway in Oz&quot;. In &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, she is seen in the background at Princess Ozma&#x27;s coronation.

The character&#x27;s popularity led to her being featured in at least two print advertisements for school desks issued by American Seating Company.

==Background==
In reference to &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz,&quot; one of Baum&#x27;s letters to his publisher, Sumner Britton of Reilly &amp; Britton, offers unusual insight on Baum&#x27;s manner of creating his Oz fantasies:

The same correspondence (November 23–27, 1912) discusses the deleted Chapter 21 of the book, &quot;The Garden of Meats&quot;. The text of the chapter has not survived, but Neill&#x27;s illustrations and their captions still exist. The deleted chapter dealt with a race of vegetable people comparable to the Mangaboos in Chapters 4–6 of &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz.&quot; The vegetable people grow what Baum elsewhere calls &quot;meat people&quot;, apparently for food; Neill&#x27;s pictures show plants with the heads of human children being watered by their growers. (This is thematically connected with the anthropophagous plants in Chapter 10 of &quot;Patchwork Girl.&quot;) Frank Reilly tactfully wrote to Baum that the material was not &quot;in harmony with your other fairy stories&quot;, and would generate &quot;considerable adverse criticism&quot;. Baum saw his point; the chapter was dropped.

The depiction of Patchwork Girl may have been influenced by the character of Topsy in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, and in turn may have influenced the character of Raggedy Ann.

At least at one point in his life, Baum stated that he considered &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; &quot;one of the two best books of my career&quot;, the other being &quot;The Sea Fairies.&quot; The book was a popular success, selling just over 17,000 copies—though this was somewhat lower than the total for the previous book, &quot;The Emerald City of Oz,&quot; and marked the start of a trend in declining sales for the Oz books that did not reverse until &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; in 1918.

==Reception==

While Baum&#x27;s work as a whole is occasionally criticized for using what may be seen as racial and ethnic stereotypes, the Patchwork Girl has come in for particular criticism. Robin Bernstein suggests the Patchwork Girl character was influenced by Topsy in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; and points out she was created by Dr. Pipt&#x27;s wife to be a slave. Moreover, the original text included a song (by the similarly animated Phonograph) about &quot;mah coal black Lulu&quot;; the lyric, evocative of minstrelsy, was changed in later editions to &quot;my cross-eyed Lulu&quot;. Similarly problematic is the inclusion in the book of a set of creatures called the Tottenhots, likely meant to be a play on the ethnic term Hottentots.

==Adaptations==
Baum wrote and produced a film based on the book, titled &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot;. It was made by Baum&#x27;s studio The Oz Film Manufacturing Company and was released in 1914. Baum was not able to find a woman of athleticism suitable to play the role, and therefore cast the male French acrobat Pierre Couderc.

Baum also wrote a musical stage adaptation of the book, circa 1913, with composer Louis F. Gottschalk; however, this musical was never staged. Excerpts have occasionally been performed at annual conventions of The International Wizard of Oz Club.

A 2005 film adaptation of the novel, produced by Thundertoad Animation, featured Cyndi Hotopp in the title role.

The character of Scraps has also been featured in a variety of television productions. The character was portrayed by Doreen Tracy on the 4th Anniversary episode of &quot;Disneyland&quot;, which aired in 1957. In the 1996 animated series &quot;The Oz Kids&quot;, she was voiced by Lori Alan and was depicted as the parent of numerous infant patchwork kids. The character was featured in the unaired television pilot &quot;Lost in Oz&quot;, under the name of Serena. In this version, the character is depicted as extremely athletic and looks like a pale human with dark hair, but is revealed to be made of fabric underneath. She is a supporting character in the 2017 animated series, &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz,&quot; voiced by Jessica DiCicco.

In the 2009 computer game, &quot;Emerald City Confidential&quot;, Scraps is presented as the owner of a general store. She is also part of Frogman&#x27;s smuggling ring.

In the 1982 stage play, &quot;Talking With...&quot;, the second monologue is about a housewife who dresses up as Scraps to escape her mundane life.

<doc id="53516" wikidata="Q445238" url="?curid=53516" title="Gladys Aylward">
<text>Gladys May Aylward (24 February 1902 – 3 January 1970) was a British-born evangelical Christian missionary to China, whose story was told in the book &quot;The Small Woman: The Heroic Story of Gladys Aylward&quot;, by Alan Burgess, published in 1957. The book served as the basis for the film &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot;, starring Ingrid Bergman, in 1958. The film was produced by Twentieth Century Fox, and filmed entirely in North Wales and England.

==Early life==
Aylward was born in 1902, one of three children of Thomas John Aylward (a postman) and Rosina Florence, a working-class family from Edmonton, North London. From her early teens, Gladys worked as a housemaid. Following a calling to go overseas as a Christian missionary, she was accepted by the China Inland Mission to study in a preparatory three-month course for aspiring missionaries. Because of her lack of progress in learning the Chinese language, she was not offered further training.

On 15 October 1930, having worked for Sir Francis Younghusband, Aylward spent her life savings on a train passage to Yangcheng, Shanxi Province, China. The dangerous trip took her across Siberia on the Trans-Siberian Railway at a time when the Soviet Union and China were in an undeclared war. She was detained by the Russians, but managed to evade them with local help and a lift from a Japanese ship. She then traveled across Japan with the help of the British Consul, and took another ship to China.

==Work in China==
Upon arriving in Yangcheng County, Aylward worked with an older missionary, Jeannie Lawson, to help manage The Inn of the Eight Happinesses (), a name based on the eight virtues of Love, Virtue, Gentleness, Tolerance, Loyalty, Truth, Beauty and Devotion. There, she and Mrs. Lawson not only provided hospitality for travelers but would also share stories about Jesus, in hopes of spreading nascent Christianity. For a time she served as an assistant to the Government of the Republic of China as a &quot;foot inspector&quot; by touring the countryside to enforce the new law against footbinding of young Chinese girls. She met with much success in a field that had produced much resistance and even violence at times against the inspectors.

Aylward became a national of the Republic of China in 1936 and was a revered figure among the people, taking in orphans and adopting several herself, intervening in a volatile prison riot and advocating prison reform, risking her life many times to help those in need. In 1938, the region was invaded by Japanese forces, and Aylward led more than 100 orphans to safety over the mountains, despite being wounded and sick, personally caring for them (and converting many to Christianity).

She did not return to Britain until 1949, when her life in China was thought to be in great danger from the Communists – the army was actively seeking out missionaries. Settling in Basingstoke, she gave many lectures on her work. After her mother died, Aylward sought a return to China. After rejection by the Communist government and a stay in British-administered Hong Kong, she finally settled in Taiwan in 1958. There, she founded the Gladys Aylward Orphanage, where she worked until her death in 1970.
==&quot; The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot;==
A film based on her life, &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot;, was released in 1958. It drew from the biography &quot;The Small Woman&quot;, by Alan Burgess. Although she found herself a figure of international interest because of the film&#x27;s popularity and television and media interviews, Aylward was mortified by her depiction in the film and the liberties it took. The tall (1.75m/5&#x27; 9&quot;), blonde Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman was inconsistent with Aylward&#x27;s small stature, dark hair, and North London accent. The struggles of Aylward and her family to effect her initial trip to China were disregarded in favor of a movie plot device of an employer &#x27;condescending to write to &quot;his old friend&quot; Jeannie Lawson&#x27;. Also, Aylward&#x27;s dangerous, complicated travels across Russia, China, and Japan were reduced to &#x27;a few rude soldiers&#x27;, after which &#x27;Hollywood&#x27;s train delivered her neatly to Tientsin&#x27;. Many characters and names were changed, even when these names had significant meaning, such as those of her adopted children and that of the inn, which was named in fact for the Chinese belief in the number 8 as being auspicious. Her own name was changed; in real life, she was given the Chinese name Aiweide ( – a phonetic approximation to Aylward), but in the film, she was given the name Jen-Ai (). Colonel Lin Nan was portrayed as half-European, a change which she found insulting to his real Chinese lineage, and she felt that the Hollywood-embellished love scenes in the film damaged her reputation. Not only had she never kissed a man, but the film&#x27;s ending portrayed her character leaving the orphans to rejoin the colonel elsewhere, even though in reality she did not retire from working with orphans until she was 60 years old. She dedicated the rest of her life to the orphans in Taiwan and was buried in Taipei.

==Death and legacy==
Aylward died on 3 January 1970, about a month and a half short of her 68th birthday, and was buried in a small cemetery on the campus of Christ&#x27;s College in Guandu, New Taipei, Taiwan. She was known to the Chinese as (). Her ministry in Taipei continues to develop and is now called Bethany Children&#x27;s Home. The new director, Sharon Chiang (), was called from Seattle to develop Bethany Children&#x27;s Home further for its new vision and new building.

A London secondary school, formerly known as &#x27;Weir Hall and Huxley&#x27;, was renamed the Gladys Aylward School shortly after her death. There is a blue commemorative plaque on the house where Gladys lived near the school at 67 Cheddington Road, London N18.

A &quot;house&quot; was also named after Gladys Aylward at Fernwood Comprehensive (formerly Secondary Modern) School, in Wollaton, Nottingham. 

Numerous books, short stories, and films have been developed about the life and work of Gladys Aylward.

<doc id="53518" wikidata="Q23169" url="?curid=53518" title="Oxfordshire">
<text>Oxfordshire ( ; abbreviated &quot;Oxon&quot;) is a ceremonial county in South East England. The county is bordered by Northamptonshire and Warwickshire to the north, Buckinghamshire to the east, Berkshire to the south, and Wiltshire and Gloucestershire to the west. The city of Oxford is the largest settlement and county town.

The county is largely rural, with an area of and a population of 691,667. After Oxford (162,100), the largest settlements are Banbury (54,355) and Abingdon-on-Thames (37,931). For local government purposes Oxfordshire is a non-metropolitan county with five districts. The part of the county south of the River Thames, largely corresponding to the Vale of White Horse district, was historically part of Berkshire.

The lowlands in the centre of the county are crossed by the River Thames and its tributaries, the valleys of which are separated by low hills. The south contains parts of the Berkshire Downs and Chiltern Hills, and the north-west includes part of the Cotswolds; all three regions are Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The county&#x27;s highest point is White Horse Hill (), part of the Berkshire Downs.

== History ==

Oxfordshire was recorded as a county in the early years of the 10th century and lies between the River Thames to the south, the Cotswolds to the west, the Chilterns to the east and the Midlands to the north, with spurs running south to Henley-on-Thames and north to Banbury.

Although it had some significance as an area of valuable agricultural land in the centre of the country, it was largely ignored by the Romans and did not grow in importance until the formation of a settlement at Oxford in the 8th century. Alfred the Great was born across the Thames in Wantage, in the Vale of White Horse. The University of Oxford was founded in 1096, although its collegiate structure did not develop until later on. The university in the county town of Oxford (whose name came from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Oxenaford&quot; = &quot;ford for oxen&quot;) grew in importance during the Middle Ages and early modern period. The area was part of the Cotswolds wool trade from the 13th century, generating much wealth, particularly in the western portions of the county in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds. Morris Motors was founded in Oxford in 1912, bringing heavy industry to an otherwise agricultural county. The role of agriculture as an employer declined rapidly in the 20th century; currently under one per cent of the county&#x27;s population are involved due to high mechanisation. Nevertheless, Oxfordshire remains a very agricultural county by land use, with a lower population than neighbouring Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, which are both smaller.

During most of its history, the county was partitioned as fourteen divisions called hundreds, namely Bampton, Banbury, Binfield, Bloxham, Bullingdon, Chadlington, Dorchester, Ewelme, Langtree, Lewknor, Pyrton, Ploughley, Thame and Wootton.

The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, the main army unit in the area, was based at Cowley Barracks on Bullingdon Green, Cowley.

The Vale of White Horse district and parts of the South Oxfordshire administrative district south of the River Thames were historically part of Berkshire, but, in 1974, Abingdon, Didcot, Faringdon, Wallingford and Wantage were added to the administrative county of Oxfordshire under the Local Government Act 1972. Conversely, the Caversham area of Reading, now administratively in Berkshire, was historically part of Oxfordshire, as was the parish of Stokenchurch, now administratively in Buckinghamshire. The areas of Oxford city south of the Thames, such as Grandpont, were transferred much earlier, in 1889.

In 2024, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; tracks were identified in Oxfordshire, which coincided with the 200th anniversary of the first scientific naming of a dinosaur, also &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. After excavations that began in 1997, the area was nicknamed &quot;the dinosaur highway&quot; by paleontologists.

== Geography ==

Oxfordshire includes parts of three Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In the north-west lie the Cotswolds; to the south and south-east are the open chalk hills of the North Wessex Downs and the wooded hills of the Chilterns. The north of the county contains the ironstone of the Cherwell uplands. Long-distance walks within the county include the Ridgeway National Trail, Macmillan Way, Oxfordshire Way and the D’Arcy Dalton Way.

=== Extreme points ===
* Northernmost point: , near Claydon Hay Farm, Claydon
* Southernmost point: , near Thames and Kennet Marina, Playhatch
* Westernmost point: , near Downs Farm, Westwell
* Easternmost point: , River Thames, near Lower Shiplake

=== Rivers and canals===
From the mid-point western edge to the southeast corner of Oxfordshire, via the city in the middle, runs the Thames with its flat floodplains. This river forms the historic limit with Berkshire, remaining so on some lowest reaches. The Thames Path National Trail follows the river from upper estuary to a source.

Many smaller rivers in the county feed into the Thames, such as the Thame, Windrush, Evenlode and Cherwell. Some of these have trails running along their valleys. The Oxford Canal links to the Midlands and follows the Cherwell from Banbury via Kidlington into the city of Oxford, where these join the navigable Thames. About 15% of the historically named Wilts &amp; Berks Canal, in sporadic sections, has been restored to navigability, including the county-relevant 140 metres near Abingdon-on-Thames where it could, if restored, meet the Thames.

===Green belt===

Oxfordshire contains a green belt area that fully envelops the city of Oxford and extends for some miles to protect surrounding towns and villages from inappropriate development and urban growth. Its border in the east extends to the Buckinghamshire county boundary, while part of its southern border is shared with the North Wessex Downs AONB. It was first drawn up in the 1950s, and all of the county&#x27;s districts contain some portion of the belt.

==Politics==
The Oxfordshire County Council, since 2013 under no overall control, is responsible for the most strategic local government functions, including schools, county roads and social services. The county is divided into five local government districts: Oxford, Cherwell, Vale of White Horse (after the Uffington White Horse), West Oxfordshire and South Oxfordshire, which deal with such matters as town and country planning, waste collection and housing.

In the 2016 European Union referendum, Oxfordshire was the only English county as a whole to vote to remain in the European Union by a significant margin, at 57.06% (70.27% in the City of Oxford), despite Cherwell (barely) voting to leave at 50.31%.

==Education==

Oxfordshire has a comprehensive education system with 23 independent schools and 35 state secondary schools. Only eight schools do not have a sixth form; these are mostly in South Oxfordshire and Cherwell districts. Oxfordshire has a large number of leading independent schools, including public schools such as Radley College.

The county has two universities: the ancient University of Oxford and the modern Oxford Brookes University, which are both located in Oxford. In addition, Wroxton College, located in Banbury, is affiliated with Fairleigh Dickinson University of New Jersey.

==Buildings==
The &quot;dreaming spires&quot; of the University of Oxford are among the reasons for which Oxford is the sixth most visited city in the United Kingdom by international visitors. Among many notable University buildings are the Sheldonian Theatre, built 1664–68 to the design of Sir Christopher Wren, and the Radcliffe Camera, built 1737–49 to the design of James Gibbs.

Blenheim Palace, close to Woodstock, was designed and partly built by the architect John Vanbrugh for John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, after he had won the battle of Blenheim. The gardens, which can be visited, were designed by the landscape gardener &quot;Capability&quot; Brown, who planted the trees in the battle formation of the victorious army. Sir Winston Churchill was born in the palace in 1874. It is open to the public.

Chastleton House, on the Gloucestershire and Warwickshire borders, is a great country mansion built on property bought from Robert Catesby, who was one of the men involved in the Gunpowder Plot with Guy Fawkes. Stonor Park, another country mansion, has belonged to the recusant Stonor family for centuries.

Mapledurham House is an Elizabethan stately home in the south-east of the county, close to Reading.

The Abbey in Sutton Courtenay is a medieval courtyard house. It has been recognised by the Historic Building Council for England (now Historic England) as a building of outstanding historic and architectural interest. It is considered to be a &#x27;textbook&#x27; example of the English medieval manor house and is a Grade I-listed building.

<doc id="53519" wikidata="Q3559720" url="?curid=53519" title="Theatre of Poland">
<text>In common with other European countries, the most frequent and most popular form of theatre in Poland is dramatic theatre, based on the existence of stable artistic companies. It is above all a theatre of directors, who decide on the form of its productions and the appearance of individual scenes. There is no strict division in Poland between theatre and film directors and actors, therefore many stage artists are known to theatre goers from films of Andrzej Wajda, for example: Wojciech Pszoniak, Daniel Olbrychski, Krystyna Janda, Jerzy Radziwiłowicz, and from films of Krzysztof Kieślowski, actors such as Jerzy Stuhr, Janusz Gajos and others.

Alongside the many types of dramatic theatre whose basis is literature, there are in Poland historic forms of theatre in which spoken word is not the most important means of expression, e.g., visual theatre popular against state censorship, musical theatre, theatre of movement, etc. An equal popularity is being gained by theatres employing puppets, figures, or shadows; there is even a theatre of drawing as well as a theatre of fire.

== Tradition ==

The strength of Polish dramatic theatre lies in the professionalism of its actors. The tradition of the great 19th century players, with Helena Modrzejewska – the &quot;star of two continents&quot; – at its forefront, has been continued by successive generations of university trained artists. This variety and authentic commitment by so many people provides the best evidence that theatre was and still is an inspirational experience in Poland. Further proof may be seen in the degree of audience interest toward the new, experimental theatre, creating a unique ambiance around them. It may also be seen in the expansion of festival life and respected theatre magazines, e.g., &quot;Dialog&quot;, which has, for decades, presented the latest achievements in world dramaturgy. Alongside the established institutions with seasoned professionals and centuries-old traditions, there are amateur theatres and travelling groups as well.

Among the professional companies, the most representative is the National Theatre in Warsaw. The core of its repertoire consists of the most cherished Polish and foreign dramas, with which directors conduct their individual dialogues, asking these classic pieces questions tormenting modern-day Poles. Within this exploration, the National Theatre frequently attempts very courageous experiments, which means that its stage, although a showcase, is not at all academic. Most characteristic are the productions of Jerzy Grzegorzewski (Theatre director between 1997 and 2002), who, employing complicated stage equipment (metaphoric scenographic elements such as pantographs, huge musical instruments, or symbolic props) and creating his own montage of classic texts, testing their value, searching for their relevance to the here and now.

Somewhat more conservative is the second Polish theatre with national status - the National Old Theatre in Kraków, the only one in Poland belonging to the Union of European Theatres. This theatre, which shone in the seventies thanks to the well-regarded and world-famous productions of Konrad Swinarski, Jerzy Jarocki, and Andrzej Wajda, is attempting to continue these traditions, seeking worthy successors to these masters. The Old Theatre&#x27;s most important current collaborator is Krystian Lupa. For years, he has been consistently producing the dramas and prose of German language writers (T. Bernhardt, R.M. Rilke, R. Musil), not even hesitating before transferring Broch&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sleepwalkers&quot; to the stage. Russian literature also lies within his sphere of interest (productions of Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; and, recently, M. Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;). Lupa shatters the traditional action of the performances, stretching their tempos and concentrating on the poetic values of particular situations rather than the plot or conflict. This is a theatre of philosophical and existential reflection in whose centre is situated the modern human being, attempting to find a place in an ever more dehumanised world. For several seasons now, Lupa&#x27;s productions have been regularly shown in Paris, where they have been received with great admiration by critics and audiences. Lupa is also one of the most important teachers of directing at the Ludwik Solski Academy for the Dramatic Arts in Kraków, where his students have included the newest generation of Polish directors: Krzysztof Warlikowski, Grzegorz Jarzyna, Maja Kleczewska, Anna Augustynowicz, Michal Zadara and Jan Klata.

== Actors and directors ==

At present, the Polish theatre actor possibly best known outside the country is Andrzej Seweryn, who in the years 1984–1988 was a member of the international group formed by Peter Brook to work on the staging of the Mahabharata, and since 1993 has been linked with the Comédie Française. The most revered actor of the second half of the twentieth century in Poland is generally considered to be Tadeusz Łomnicki, who died in 1992 of a heart attack while rehearsing &quot;King Lear&quot;.

During the second half of the nineties, there appeared in Polish dramatic theatre a new generation of young directors, who have attempted to create productions relevant to the experience and problems of a thirty-something generation brought up surrounded by mass culture, habituated to a fast-moving lifestyle, but at the same time ever more lost in the world of consumer capitalism. The leading theatre in this movement is Warsaw&#x27;s TR, known as &quot;the fastest theatre in town&quot;. Among its collaborating directors, Krzysztof Warlikowski and Grzegorz Jarzyna stand out. Warlikowski has gained international recognition with a series of innovative productions of Shakespeare, performed both at Polish theatres (&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;) and abroad (&quot;Pericles&quot; at the Piccolo Teatro in Milan, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot; at the Stadt-Theater in Stuttgart). Looking for a way to present the complex existential situation of contemporary humanity, Jarzyna reaches both for contemporary drama (Witkiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Tropical Madness&quot;, Gombrowicz&#x27;s &quot;Princess Ivona&quot;, or Frazer&#x27;s &quot;Unidentified Human Remains...&quot;) and classic European novels (Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot;, Mann&#x27;s &quot;Doktor Faustus&quot;, directed at the Hebbel Theater in Berlin). Recently, both directors have taken an interest in the work of Sarah Kane, mounting startling productions: &quot;Cleansed&quot; (Warlikowski) and &quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot; (Jarzyna).

The true rebirth, following the collapse of the Soviet empire, was experienced by the Ludowy Theatre in Nowa Huta district of Kraków taken over by an actor, director, and politician Jerzy Fedorowicz (1989–2005). Under his management, the theatre won considerable recognition, and numerous awards. It was twice invited to the Edinburgh International Festival: in 1996 with &quot;Macbeth&quot; directed by Jerzy Stuhr, and in 1997 with &quot;Antigone&quot; directed by Włodzimierz Nurkowski. Current director is Jacek Strama, an award-winning theatre and film producer.
== Venues ==

The theatrical map of Poland, on which for many years the most important points were Warsaw and Kraków, has undergone numerous changes over the last decade. The most recognized directors in Poland, such as Krzysztof Warlikowski, Grzegorz Jarzyna, Jan Klata, Michal Zadara or Maja Kleczewska work in Warsaw, but also travel to other cities. While it is true to say that the capital&#x27;s position is safe, there is strong competition for second place between Kraków and Wrocław. Recognised masters (Jerzy Jarocki, Krystian Lupa) and a group of younger directors, with Piotr Cieplak and Paweł Miśkiewicz at the head, collaborate with Wrocław&#x27;s theatres. Poznań, Gdańsk, and Łódź have similar ambitions. One of the more unanticipated surprises of recent seasons has been the blossoming of theatre in Legnica, a town which, until recent times, was the main Soviet military base in Poland, where the artistic director, Jacek Głomb, has been actively searching for new ways to reach the town&#x27;s inhabitants. So he began putting on shows relating events in the lives of the local citizens, as well as siting classical dramas in surprising arenas (e.g., Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus&quot; in an old Prussian barracks). Since Pawel Lysak became the artistic director of the theatre in Bydgoszcz, this city in central Poland has been able to enjoy top-level theatre as well.

There is no doubt that the greatest achievements of the 20th-century Polish theatre are thanks to those artists seeking new forms and functions for the theatrical arts. From the very beginning of the great European reform movement, Polish theatre people have undertaken courageous experiments in this area. The Polish stream of reform was characterised by the linking of theatre with metaphysics. The source of this type of search was the work and thinking of the Polish Romantics, with Adam Mickiewicz at the forefront. In his &quot;Forefathers&#x27; Eve&quot;, the most important work in Polish literature, there is a vision of theatre as phenomenon on the border between a show and a ceremony led by an actor. In succeeding years, the most important artists of the Polish stage referred to, and sometimes polemicized with, this vision, developing or modifying it.
It was from this root that Stanisław Wyspiański&#x27;s art arose. Poet, painter, visionary, working at the beginning of the twentieth century he influenced the development of theatre over the course of the following century. His works, born of Romantic and symbolic inspiration, conjoining Catholic, pagan, and classic traditions with the existential and political problems of the new century, has not been completely discovered and understood to this day, forming a vivid and fascinating heritage. It was to this tradition that the originators of Polish monumental theatre, Leon Schiller (Edward Gordon Craig&#x27;s collaborator), Juliusz Osterwa, and Wilam Horzyca, harked back. Tadeusz Kantor, the avant-garde visual artist who became interested in theatre while trying to find new forms of expression, also alluded to it in his theatrical searches. After years of investigation (attempts to adapt the rules of Tachism and performance art to the needs of the theatre), Kantor created his own model, called the Theatre of Death. In his most famous productions - &quot;The Dead Class&quot;, &quot;Wielopole, Wielopole&quot; or &quot;I Shall Never Return&quot; - the artist presented a kind of spiritualist séance, calling pictures, words and sounds deformed by the passing of time. Referring to his memories and experiences, he portrayed a collective memory of the end of the tragic twentieth century - the century of the Holocaust.

== Jerzy Grotowski ==
Though arising from the same roots, a totally different attempt to renew theatre was undertaken by Jerzy Grotowski. Aiming for the creation of a performance as a selfless act of sacrifice, he carried out the second great reform, after Konstantin Stanisłavski&#x27;s, of the actor&#x27;s art, and his book &quot;Towards a Poor Theatre&quot; is still one of the most important textbooks in drama schools the world over. The productions put on by Grotowski&#x27;s Theatre Laboratory, such as &quot;Acropolis&quot; (Wyspiański&#x27;s drama, re-set in a concentration camp), &quot;The Constant Prince&quot; (after Calderon-Słowacki) or &quot;Apocalypsis cum figuris&quot;, are among twentieth-century world theatre&#x27;s most important achievements, still points of reference for many artists. Among others, Peter Brook, Eugenio Barba, Marketa Kimbrell, Richard Schechner and Andre Gregory have derived inspiration from Grotowski&#x27;s work. Over the last decade of his life, Grotowski had been investigating the possibility of creating a dramatic structure whose effect would be similar to that of a religious ceremony. After his death (1999), the work was continued by his students, Thomas Richards and Mario Biagini, leading the Workcenter, founded by Grotowski in Pontedera in Italy.

Grotowski&#x27;s work has also influenced many Polish theatre artistes. Włodzimierz Staniewski, who, after some years of close collaboration with Grotowski, finally rebelled, founded the &quot;Gardzienice&quot; Centre for Theatrical Practice in 1977 in a small village near Lublin. Today, 25 years later, this centre is world-famous and Staniewski&#x27;s method of acting, known as &quot;theatre ecology,&quot; has been numbered among the most important of the twentieth century. The most characteristic aspect of &quot;Gardzienice&quot; is its treatment of theatre as one of many various cultural activities, including expeditions to areas inhabited by people holding onto folk traditions (e.g., the Eastern parts of Poland, Lemko villages or the Ukrainian Hucul region), and a strong link between art and the environment from which it arises. The productions themselves, unusually intense and filled with music, movement and dramatic singing - recall the fundamental myths of East and West.

For several years, Staniewski has been particularly interested in Ancient Greece as a source of European culture and spirituality. After Apuleius&#x27; &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (performed in Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain, among other countries) he brought into being, with &quot;Gardzienice&quot;, a production of Eurypides&#x27; &quot;Elektra&quot;, blazing new trails in his theatrical search. From the ranks of Włodzimierz Staniewski&#x27;s group have come the founders of many active and uncommonly interesting centres, and not just connected with theatre.

In Sejny, there is the Borderland Foundation, created by Krzysztof Czyżewski, a one-time Gardzienice collaborator. One of &quot;Borderland&#x27;s&quot; forms of work is theatre (e.g., a production of Szymon Anski&#x27;s &quot;Dybbuk&quot;), and its aim is to raise the consciousness of the inhabitants of the borderlands regarding the unique richness of their cultural tradition, which has for centuries linked Polish, Jewish, Belarusian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and even Tatar influences. In common with Czyżewski, the founder of the &quot;Music of the Eastern Lands&quot; Foundation, Jan Bernad, also came from Gardzienice, and has devoted himself to gathering and reconstructing the rich multiethnic traditions of the ancient music from the Eastern Borders for years.

During the Sixties and Seventies, at the same time as Grotowski&#x27;s work, the movement of social and politically engaged theatre was also developing in Poland. At first, it was, above all, a rebellious student theatre, later, during the period of martial law, the movement also accepted professionals, who organised productions for the underground Home Theatre. One specific form of political rebellion through theatre was promoted by Wrocław&#x27;s Orange Alternative, an informal group which organised mass events poking fun at the symbols and ceremonies of officialdom. After the regaining of sovereignty in 1989, this movement weakened, but recently it has been reborn as an anticapitalist and antiwar movement. The most important centre for this kind of activity is Poznań, where, alongside the once famous and still active Theatre of the Eighth Day (the antiglobalist production &quot;Summit&quot;), the Travel Agency Theatre operates. One of its most important achievements is the open-air production &quot;Carmen Funebre&quot;, created under the influence of events in the former Yugoslavia and shown all over the world.

Another developing stream of theatre in Poland is so-called visual theatre, using pictures above all, and almost completely avoiding the spoken word. Its originator is considered to be Józef Szajna (1922), an artist whose collaboration with theatre began with stage design, went on to direction, and, since the seventies, the creation of theatrical productions employing striking pictures referring to expressionist and surrealist aesthetics. The unique form of Szajna&#x27;s theatre arose both from his artistic and personal experiences (during WWII he was a concentration camp prisoner). They were based on a vision of a deformed world in which battles are fought over the basic human values, which are constantly under threat. Szajna&#x27;s most famous productions, also performed abroad, are &quot;Dante&quot;, &quot;Cervantes&quot;, and &quot;Replica&quot;, which directly relate to his traumatic wartime experiences.

Currently, the leading representative of visual theatre is Leszek Mądzik, the founder of the Visual Stage at the Catholic University of Lublin. He has, for many years, put on productions that are a kind of theatrical meditation, touching on existential and religious topics.

Close to this stream are the strongly theatrical happenings of Jerzy Kalina as well as the theatrical activities of Warsaw&#x27;s Academy of Movement. Speaking of the borderline between art and theatre, it is also worth recalling that there are still active performance artists in Poland. Polish experimental theatre has been counted among the most interesting in Europe, evidence of which are regular prestigious Fringe First awards from the Edinburgh Festival. In recent years, for example, the Travel Agency, Wierszalin, Kana, Song of the Goat, and Provisorium theatres have been recognised in this way.

During recent years in Poland, there has been a boom in musical theatre. Alongside the world-famous composers and singers, Polish directors of opera are rated ever more highly. The most important among this group has, for years, been Ryszard Peryt, collaborating with the Warsaw Chamber Opera (organising the annual Mozart Festival, among others) and the National Opera. His speciality is the production of oratorios, among which the theatrical version of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, which has been performed in Moscow&#x27;s Red Square, stands out. Recent seasons have been a period of great operatic success for the film director Mariusz Treliński, who has aroused the interest of New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera. Critical acclaim has also been enjoyed by the opera stage designs of Andrzej Majewski.

Growing popularity is also enjoyed by dance theatre. In addition to classical ballet, whose best groups have for years been linked with opera halls, contemporary dance groups have been appearing since the Sixties and Seventies. Among the most important are Poznań&#x27;s Polish Theatre of Dance, founded by Conrad Drzewiecki and currently led by Ewa Wycichowska, and Wrocław&#x27;s &quot;Pantomima&quot;, founded by Henryk Tomaszewski (1919–2001). Since the nineties, both Bytom (Silesian Dance Theatre) and Kraków have become important centres, hosting festivals which attract dancers from all over the world.

== Festivals ==
International festivals are a particular element of Polish theatre life, occasions to allow the artistic achievements of East and West to confront each other. To this end, there are such festivals as &quot;Contact,&quot; taking place annually in Toruń, and &quot;Dialogue,&quot; organised biannually in autumn in Wrocław, in turn with Kraków&#x27;s &quot;Dedications&quot; (October) and Warsaw&#x27;s &quot;Meetings&quot; (November). Aside from these, the most interesting events are &quot;Theatrical Confrontations&quot; in Lublin (October), the open-air &quot;Malta&quot; festival in Poznań (June), Kraków&#x27;s &quot;Ballet in Spring&quot; and the Puppet Theatre Biennial in Bielsko-Biała.

One world-famous person who had links with 20th-century Polish theatre and was Pope John Paul II. His interest in theatre dated back to his secondary school years in Wadowice, where the teenage Karol Wojtyła worked in the school theatre. During the Second World War, he co-founded, with his old teacher Mieczysław Kotlarczyk, the underground Rhapsodic Theatre, a group cultivating the Romantic tradition of live poetry. After the war, as a priest, he supported the group and was also its critic, publishing reviews of its performances. Within his literary work, John Paul II also has written a number of dramas, the best-known of which are &quot;Our God&#x27;s Brother&quot; and &quot;The Jeweller&#x27;s Shop&quot;.

<doc id="53520" wikidata="Q332618" url="?curid=53520" title="Jerzy Grotowski">
<text>Jerzy Marian Grotowski (; 11 August 1933 – 14 January 1999) was a Polish theatre director and theorist whose innovative approaches to acting, training and theatrical production have significantly influenced theatre today. He is considered one of the most influential theatre practitioners of the 20th century as well as one of the founders of experimental theatre.

He was born in Rzeszów, in southeastern Poland, in 1933 and studied acting and directing at the Ludwik Solski Academy of Dramatic Arts in Kraków and Russian Academy of Theatre Arts in Moscow. He debuted as a director in 1957 in Kraków with Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s play &quot;Chairs&quot; (co-directed with Aleksandra Mianowska) and shortly afterward founded a small laboratory theatre in 1959 in the town of Opole in Poland. During the 1960s, the company began to tour internationally and his work attracted increasing interest. As his work gained wider acclaim and recognition, Grotowski was invited to work in the United States and left Poland in 1982. Although the company he founded in Poland closed a few years later in 1984, he continued to teach and direct productions in Europe and America. However, Grotowski became increasingly uncomfortable with the adoption and adaptation of his ideas and practices, particularly in the US. So, at what seemed to be the height of his public profile, he left America and moved to Italy where he established the Grotowski Workcenter in 1985 in Pontedera, near Pisa. At this centre, he continued his theatre experimentation and practice, and it was here that he continued to direct training and private theatrical events almost in secret for the last twenty years of his life. Suffering from leukemia and a heart condition, he died in 1999 at his home in Pontedera.

==Biography==
Jerzy Grotowski was 6 when World War II broke out in 1939. During the war, Grotowski, with his mother and brother, moved from Rzeszów to the village of Nienadówka.

===Career===

==== Theatre of Productions ====
Grotowski made his individual directorial debut in 1958 with the production &quot;Gods of Rain&quot;, which introduced his bold approach to text, which he continued to develop throughout his career, influencing many subsequent theatre artists. Later in 1958, Grotowski moved to Opole, where he was invited by the theatre critic and dramaturg Ludwik Flaszen to serve as director of the Theatre of 13 Rows. There he began to assemble a company of actors and artistic collaborators which would help him realize his unique vision. It was also there that he began to experiment with approaches to performance training, which enabled him to shape young actors. Although his methods were often contrasted to those of Konstantin Stanislavski, he admired the Russian as &quot;the first great creator of a method of acting in the theatre&quot; and praised him for asking &quot;all the relevant questions that could be asked about theatrical technique.&quot;

Among the many productions for which his theatre company became famous were &quot;Orpheus&quot; by Jean Cocteau, &quot;Shakuntala&quot; based on text by Kalidasa, &quot;Dziady (Forefathers&#x27; Eve)&quot; by Adam Mickiewicz, and &quot;Akropolis&quot; by Stanisław Wyspiański. This last production was the first complete realization of Grotowski&#x27;s notion of &quot;poor theatre.&quot; In it the company of actors (representing concentration camp prisoners) build the structure of a crematorium around the audience while acting out stories from the Bible and Greek mythology. This conceptualization had particular resonance for the audiences in Opole, as the Auschwitz concentration camp was only sixty miles away. &quot;Akropolis&quot; received much attention and could be said to have launched Grotowski&#x27;s career internationally due to inventive and aggressive promotion by visiting foreign scholars and theatre professionals. A film of the production was made with an introduction by Peter Brook, which constitutes one of the most accessible and concrete records of Grotowski&#x27;s work.

In 1964, Grotowski followed success with success when his theatre premiered &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot; based on the Elizabethan drama by Christopher Marlowe, featuring Zbigniew Cynkutis in the title role. Foregoing the use of props altogether, Grotowski let the actors&#x27; bodies represent objects. He seated audience members as the guests at Faust&#x27;s last supper, with the action unfolding on and around their table.

In 1965, Grotowski moved his company to Wrocław, relabeling them a &quot;Teatr Laboratorium&quot;, in part to avoid the heavy censorship to which professional &quot;theatres&quot; were subject in Poland at that time. Work had already begun on one of their most famous productions, &quot;The Constant Prince&quot; (based on Juliusz Słowacki&#x27;s translation of Calderón&#x27;s play). Debuting in 1967, this production was soon considered to be a major success. In one of his final essays, Grotowski detailed how he worked individually with actor Ryszard Cieslak for more than a year to develop the scenes of torture and martyrdom intrinsic to the play.

Grotowski&#x27;s last professional production as a director was in 1969. Entitled &quot;Apocalypsis Cum Figuris,&quot; it uses texts from the Bible, this time combined with contemporary writings from authors such as T. S. Eliot and Simone Weil, this production was cited by members of the company as an example of a group &#x27;total act&#x27;. The development of &quot;Apocalypsis&quot; took more than three years, beginning as a staging of Słowacki&#x27;s &quot;Samuel Zborowski&quot; and passing through a separate stage of development as a staging of the Gospels, &quot;Ewangelie&quot; (elaborated as a completed performance though never presented to audiences) before arriving to its final form.

Grotowski revolutionized theatre and along with his first apprentice, Eugenio Barba, leader and founder of Odin Teatret, is considered a father of contemporary experimental theatre. Barba was instrumental in revealing Grotowski to the world outside the iron curtain. He was the editor of the seminal book &quot;Towards a Poor Theatre&quot; (1968), which Grotowski wrote together with Ludwik Flaszen, in which it is declared that theatre should not, because it could not, compete against the overwhelming spectacle of film and should instead focus on the very root of the act of theatre: actors cocreating the event of theatre with its spectators.

Theatre - through the actor&#x27;s technique, his art in which the living organism strives for higher motives - provides an opportunity for what could be called integration, the discarding of masks, the revealing of the real substance: a totality of physical and mental reactions. This opportunity must be treated in a disciplined manner, with a full awareness of the responsibilities it involves. Here we can see the theatre&#x27;s therapeutic function for people in our present[-]day civilization. It is true that the actor accomplishes this act, but he can only do so through an encounter with the spectator - intimately, visibly, not hiding behind a cameraman, wardrobe mistress, stage designer or make-up girl - in direct confrontation with him, and somehow &quot; instead of&quot; him. The actor&#x27;s act - discarding half measures, revealing, opening up, emerging from himself as opposed to closing up - is an invitation to the spectator. This act could be compared to an act of the most deeply rooted, genuine love between two human beings - this is just a comparison since we can only refer to this &quot;emergence from oneself&quot; through analogy. This act, paradoxical and borderline, we call a total act. In our opinion it epitomizes the actor&#x27;s deepest calling.

==== Debut in the west ====
The year 1968 marked Grotowski&#x27;s debut in the West. His company performed the Stanisław Wyspiański play &quot;Akropolis/Acropolis&quot; (1964) at the Edinburgh Festival. This was a fitting vehicle for Grotowski and his poor theatre because his treatment of the play in Poland had already achieved wider recognition and was published in &quot;Pamiętnik Teatralny&quot; (Warsaw, 1964), &quot;Alla Ricerca del Teatro Perduto&quot; (Padova, 1965), and &quot;Tulane Drama Review&quot; (New Orleans, 1965). It marked the first time many in Britain had been exposed to &quot;poor theatre&quot;. The same year, his book titled &quot;Towards a Poor Theatre&quot; appeared in Danish, published by Odin Teatrets Forlag. It appeared in English the following year, published by Methuen and Co. Ltd., with an Introduction by Peter Brook, then an associate director at the Royal Shakespeare Company. In it he writes feelingly about Grotowski&#x27;s private consulting for the company; he/they felt Grotowski&#x27;s work was unique but equally understood that its value was diminished if talked about too much, if faith were broken with the consultant.

Grotowski&#x27;s company made its debut in the United States under the auspices of the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the fall of 1969. BAM built a theatre for Grotowski&#x27;s company in the Washington Square Methodist Church in Greenwich Village. Three productions were presented: Akropolis, &quot;The Constant Prince&quot; and &quot;Apocalypsis Cum Figuris&quot; during a three-week run.
==== Paratheatrical phase ====
In 1973 Grotowski published &quot;Holiday&quot;, which outlined a new course of investigation. He would pursue this &#x27;Paratheatrical&#x27; phase until 1978. This phase is known as the &#x27;Paratheatrical&#x27; phase of his career because it was an attempt to transcend the separation between performer and spectator. Grotowski attempted this through the organization of communal rites and simple interactive exchanges that went on sometimes for extended periods, attempting to provoke in poor participants a deconditioning of impulse. The most widely circulated description of one of these post-theatrical events (a &quot;beehive&quot;) is given by Andre Gregory, Grotowski&#x27;s longtime friend and the American director whose work he most strongly endorsed, in &quot;My Dinner With Andre&quot;. Various collaborators who had been important to Grotowski&#x27;s work in what he termed his &quot;Theatre of Productions&quot; phase had difficulty following him in these explorations beyond the boundary of conventional theatre. Other, younger members of the group came to the foreground, notably Jacek Zmysłowski, whom many would consider Grotowski&#x27;s closest collaborator in this period. Theatre critics have often exoticized and mystified Grotowski&#x27;s work on the basis of these paratheatrical experiments, suggesting that his work should be seen in the lineage of Antonin Artaud, a suggestion Grotowski strongly resisted. Later in life, he clarified that he quickly found this direction of research limiting, having realized that unstructured work frequently elicits banalities and cultural cliché from participants.

==== Theatre of Sources ====
In this period of his work, Grotowski traveled intensively through India, Mexico, Haiti and elsewhere, seeking to identify elements of technique in the traditional practices of various cultures that could have a precise and discernible effect on participants. Key collaborators in this phase of work include Włodzimierz Staniewski, subsequently founder of Gardzienice Theatre, Jairo Cuesta and Magda Złotowska, who traveled with Grotowski on his international expeditions. His interest in ritual techniques linked to Haitian practice led Grotowski to a long-standing collaboration with Maud Robart and Jean-Claude Tiga of Saint Soleil. Always a master strategist, Grotowski made use of his international ties and the relative freedom of travel allowed him to pursue this program of cultural research in order to flee Poland following the imposition of martial law. He spent time in Haiti and in Rome, where he delivered a series of important lectures on the topic of theatre anthropology at the Sapienza University of Rome in 1982 before seeking political asylum in the United States. His dear friends Andre and Mercedes Gregory helped Grotowski to settle in the US, where he taught at Columbia University for one year while attempting to find support for a new program of research.

==== Objective Drama ====
Unable (despite the best efforts of Richard Schechner) to secure resources for his projected research in Manhattan, in 1983 Grotowski received an invitation from Robert Cohen to come to the University of California, Irvine, where he began a course of work known as Objective Drama. This phase of his research focused on participants&#x27; psychophysiological responses to selected songs and other performative tools derived from traditional cultures, focusing specifically on relatively simple techniques that could elicit discernible and predictable effects on the &#x27;doers&#x27;, regardless of their belief structures or culture of origin. Ritual songs and related performative elements linked to Haitian and other African diaspora traditions became a favoured tool of research. During this time Grotowski continued several collaborative relationships begun in earlier phases, and Maud Robart, Jairo Cuesta and Pablo Jimenez took on significant roles as performers and research leaders in the project. He also initiated a creative relationship with the American Keith Fowler and his student, James Slowiak. Another trusted collaborator was Thomas Richards, son of Canadian-American director Lloyd Richards, to whom Grotowski would ultimately pass on responsibility for his lifelong research.

==== Art as Vehicle ====
In 1986, Grotowski was invited by Roberto Bacci oto his theater center in Pontedera, Italy. There, he was offered an opportunity to conduct long-term research on performance without the pressure of having to show results until he was ready. Grotowski gladly accepted, taking with him three assistants from Objective Drama research (Richards, Jimenez and Slowiak) to help in founding his Italian Workcenter. Robart also led a work-team in Pontedera for several years, after which time funding cuts necessitated downscaling to a single research group, led by Richards. Grotowski characterized the focus of his attention in his final phase of research as &quot;art as a vehicle,&quot; a term coined by Peter Brook. &quot;It seems to me,&quot; Brook said, &quot;that Grotowski is showing us something which existed in the past but has been forgotten over the centuries; that is that one of the vehicles which allows man to have access to another level of perception is to be found in the art of performance.&quot; Moreover, it was in 1986 that Grotowski changed the name of the Italian centre to the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards, to signal the unique and central place Richards held in his work. Grotowski drove Richards to take on increasingly greater responsibility and leadership in the work, until he was not only the primary doer in the practice of Art as Vehicle, but also its primal leader and &quot;director&quot; (if such a term can be accurately used) of the performance structures created around these Afro-Caribbean vibratory songs, most significantly &#x27;Downstairs Action&#x27; (filmed by Mercedes Gregory in 1989) and &#x27;Action&#x27;, on which work began in 1994 and continues to the present. Italian actor Mario Biagini, who joined the Workcenter shortly after its founding, also became a central contributor to this research. Although Grotowski died in 1999 at the end of a prolonged illness, the research of Art as Vehicle continues at the Pontedera Workcenter, with Richards as artistic director and Biagini as associate director. Grotowski&#x27;s Will declared the two his &quot;universal heirs,&quot; holders of copyright on the entirety of his textual output and intellectual property.

==Voice Work==
Jerzy Grotowski was among a small group of actors and directors, including Peter Brook and Roy Hart, who sought to explore new forms of theatrical expression without employing the spoken word. In the programme notes to the production of one of Grotowski&#x27;s performances called &quot;Akropolis&quot;, of which the premiere was in October 1962, one of the performers stated:

The means of verbal expression have been considerably enlarged because all means of vocal expression are used, starting from the confused babbling of the very small child and including the most sophisticated oratorical recitation. Inarticulate groans, animal roars, tender folksongs, liturgical chants, dialects, declamation of poetry: everything is there. The sounds are interwoven in a complex score which brings back fleetingly the memory of all forms of language.

Grotowski and his group of actors became known in particular for their experimental work on the human voice, partially inspired by the work of Roy Hart, who in turn furthered the extended vocal technique initially established by Alfred Wolfsohn. Alan Seymour, speaking of Grotowski&#x27;s 1963 production of &quot;Faustus&quot; noted that the performers&#x27; voices &#x27;reached from the smallest whisper to an astonishing, almost cavernous tone, an intoned declaiming, of a resonance and power I have not heard from actors before&#x27;.

The use of non-verbal voice in these productions was part of Grotowski&#x27;s investigation into the use of the actor&#x27;s own self as the substance of performance, and his work was founded upon his belief in the ability of a human being to express physically and vocally aspects of the psyche, including those parts allegedly buried in what Carl Jung called the collective unconscious, without recourse to words.

==Analytical Psychology==

Both Grotowski and Hart compared the desired effect of the rehearsal process upon their actors, and the impact of their performances upon the audience to psychotherapy, drawing upon the principles of Carl Jung and analytical psychology to explain the principles behind their creativity. Grotowski said that theatre &#x27;is a question of a gathering which is subordinated to ritual: nothing is represented or shown, but we participate in a ceremonial which releases the collective unconscious&#x27;.
Grotowski repeatedly described his rehearsal process and performances as &#x27;sacred&#x27;, seeking to revive what he understood to be the routes of drama in religious ritual and spiritual practice.

To achieve his aims, Grotowski demanded that his actors draw from their psyches images of a collective significance and give them form through the motion of the body and the sound of the voice. Grotowski&#x27;s ultimate aim was to effect in the actor change and growth, transformation and rebirth in order that the actor, in turn, could precipitate a similar development in the audience. It was for this reason that Grotowski often chose to base productions on works based on ancient narratives. For he believed that they &#x27;embodied myths and images powerful and universal enough to function as archetypes, which could penetrate beneath the apparently divisive and individual structure of the Western psyche, and evoke a spontaneous, collective, internal response&#x27;.

James Roose-Evans states that Grotowski&#x27;s theatre &#x27;speaks directly to the fundamental experience of each person present, to what Jung described as the collective unconscious ... what Grotowski asks of the actor is not that he play the Lady from the Sea or Hamlet, but that he confront these characters within himself and offer the result of that encounter to an audience.

Grotowski, like Hart, did not consider the dramatic text or script to be primary in this process, but believed that the text &#x27;becomes theatre only through the actors&#x27; use of it, that is to say, thanks to intonations, to the association of sounds, to the musicality of language&#x27;. Grotowski thus pursued the possibility of creating &#x27;ideograms&#x27; made up of &#x27;sounds and gestures&#x27; which &#x27;evoke associations in the psyche of the audience&#x27;. But, for Grotowski, as for Hart, there was, between the psyche&#x27;s reservoir of images and the bodily and vocal expression of that imagery, a series of inhibitions, resistances and blocks, which his acting exercises set out to remove. Many of the acting exercises and rehearsal techniques developed by Grotowski were designed to removing these personal obstacles, which prevented the physical and vocal expression of this imagery, and Grotowski proposed that such a training process &#x27;leads to a liberation from complexes in much the same way as psychoanalytic therapy&#x27;.

<text>The Morris worm or Internet worm of November 2, 1988, is one of the oldest computer worms distributed via the Internet, and the first to gain significant mainstream media attention. It resulted in the first felony conviction in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It was written by a graduate student at Cornell University, Robert Tappan Morris, and launched on 8:30 p.m. November 2, 1988, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology network.

== Architecture ==

The worm&#x27;s creator, Robert Tappan Morris, is the son of cryptographer Robert Morris, who worked at the NSA. A friend of Morris said that he created the worm simply to see if it could be done, and released it from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the hope of suggesting that its creator studied there, instead of Cornell. 
Clifford Stoll, author of &quot;The Cuckoo’s Egg&quot;, wrote that &quot;Rumors have it that [Morris] worked with a friend or two at Harvard&#x27;s computing department (Harvard student Paul Graham sent him mail asking for &#x27;Any news on the brilliant project&#x27;)&quot;.

The worm exploited several vulnerabilities of targeted systems, including:

* A hole in the debug mode of the Unix sendmail program
* A buffer overflow or overrun hole in the finger network service
* The transitive trust enabled by people setting up network logins with no password requirements via remote execution (rexec) with Remote Shell (rsh), termed rexec/rsh

The worm exploited weak passwords. Morris&#x27;s exploits became generally obsolete due to decommissioning rsh (normally disabled on untrusted networks), fixes to sendmail and finger, widespread network filtering, and improved awareness of weak passwords.

Though Morris said that he did not intend for the worm to be actively destructive, instead seeking to merely highlight the weaknesses present in many networks of the time, a consequence of Morris&#x27;s coding resulted in the worm being more damaging and spreadable than originally planned. It was initially programmed to check each computer to determine if the infection was already present, but Morris believed that some system administrators might counter this by instructing the computer to report a false positive. Instead, he programmed the worm to copy itself 14% of the time, regardless of the status of infection on the computer. This resulted in a computer potentially being infected multiple times, with each additional infection slowing the machine down to unusability. This had the same effect as a fork bomb, and crashed the computer several times. 

The main body of the worm can infect only DEC VAX machines running 4BSD, alongside Sun-3 systems. A portable C &quot;grappling hook&quot; component of the worm was used to download the main body parts, and the grappling hook runs on other systems, loading them down and making them peripheral victims.

==Replication rate==
By instructing the worm to replicate itself regardless of a computer&#x27;s reported infection status, Morris transformed the worm from a potentially harmless intellectual and computing exercise into a viral denial-of-service attack. Morris&#x27;s inclusion of the rate of copy within the worm was inspired by Michael Rabin&#x27;s mantra of &quot;randomization&quot;. 

The resulting level of replication proved excessive, with the worm spreading rapidly, infecting some computers several times. Rabin would eventually comment that Morris &quot;should have tried it on a simulator first&quot;.

== Effects ==
During the Morris appeal process, the US court of appeals estimated the cost of removing the virus from each installation was in the range of $200–$53,000. Possibly based on these numbers, Stoll, a systems administrator known for discovering and subsequently tracking the hacker Markus Hess three years earlier, estimated for the US Government Accountability Office that the total economic impact was between $100,000 and $10,000,000. Stoll helped fight the worm, writing in 1989 that &quot;I surveyed the network, and found that two thousand computers were infected within fifteen hours. These machines were dead in the water—useless until disinfected. And removing the virus often took two days.&quot; Stoll commented that the worm showed the danger of monoculture, because &quot;If all the systems on the ARPANET ran Berkeley Unix, the virus would have disabled all fifty thousand of them.&quot;

It is usually reported that around 6,000 major UNIX machines were infected by the Morris worm. Graham claimed, &quot;I was there when this statistic was cooked up, and this was the recipe: someone guessed that there were about 60,000 computers attached to the Internet, and that the worm might have infected ten percent of them&quot;. Stoll estimated that &quot;only a couple thousand&quot; computers were affected.

The Internet was partitioned for several days, as regional networks disconnected from the NSFNet backbone and from each other to prevent recontamination while cleaning their own networks.

The Morris worm prompted DARPA to fund the establishment of the CERT/CC at Carnegie Mellon University, giving experts a central point for coordinating responses to network emergencies. Gene Spafford also created the Phage mailing list to coordinate a response to the emergency.

Morris was tried and convicted of violating United States Code Title18 (), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, in &quot;United States v. Morris&quot;. After appeals, he was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation, 400 hours of community service, and a fine of plus the costs of his supervision. The total fine ran to $13,326, which included a $10,000 fine, $50 special assessment, and $3,276 cost of probation oversight.

The Morris worm has sometimes been referred to as the &quot;Great Worm,&quot; due to the devastating effect it had on the Internet at that time, both in overall system downtime and in psychological impact on the perception of security and reliability of the Internet. The name was derived from the &quot;Great Worms&quot; of Tolkien: Scatha and Glaurung.

== In popular culture ==
* The 1995 film &quot;Hackers&quot; features a main character who releases a viral attack bearing several similarities to the Morris worm. The event takes place in 1988, infects over 1,000 computers, causes a massive economic disruption, and results in its propagator being fined and put on probation.
* In the visual novel &quot;&quot;, the Morris worm is portrayed as a cover story for a large-scale attack on ARPANET and several bulletin board systems.
* In the epilogue of his book &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Egg&quot;, Stoll details his efforts battling the Morris worm.
* In &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot;, a virus that works in a similar way to the Morris worm is created to gauge the size of the network.
* In &quot;Date Time&quot;, an indie developed video game, the Morris worm is portrayed as a character in a dating sim.
* In &quot;Gori: Cuddly Carnage&quot;, a game developed by Angry Demon Studio, a floppy disk can be seen containing the Morris worm.
* In Merryweather Media&#x27;s webcomic &#x27;Internet Explorer&#x27;, The Morris Worm is portrayed as a tragic antagonist, who&#x27;s goal was to map out the size of the internet, but accidentally brought it to near-collapse.

<doc id="53525" wikidata="Q182172" url="?curid=53525" title="GameCube">
<text>The is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo. It was released in Japan on September 14, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, in Europe on May 3, 2002, and in Australia on May 17, 2002. It is the successor to the Nintendo 64. As a sixth-generation console, the GameCube primarily competed with Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2, Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox.

Nintendo began developing the GameCube in 1998 after entering a partnership with ArtX to design a graphics processing unit. The console was formally announced under the codename &quot;Dolphin&quot; the following year, and was released in 2001 as the GameCube. It is Nintendo&#x27;s first console to use its own optical discs instead of ROM cartridges, supplemented by writable memory cards for saved games. Unlike its competitors, it is solely focused on gaming and does not play mass media like DVD or CD. The console supports limited online gaming for a few games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable for exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller. The GameCube supports e-Reader cards to unlock special features in a few games. The Game Boy Player add-on runs Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridge games.

Reception of the GameCube was mixed. It was praised for its controller and high quality games library, but was criticized for its lack of multimedia features and lack of third party support compared to its competitors. Premier games include &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot;, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot;, &quot;Pikmin&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot;, &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; and &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;. Nintendo sold GameCube units worldwide, much fewer than anticipated, and discontinued it in 2007. It was succeeded by the Wii in late 2006.

== History ==

=== Background ===
In 1997, graphics hardware design company ArtX was launched with twenty engineers who had previously worked at SGI. ArtX was led by Wei Yen, who had been SGI&#x27;s head of Nintendo Operations and of Project Reality, which from 1993 to 1996 had scaled down SGI&#x27;s supercomputer design to become the Nintendo 64.

=== Development ===
In May 1998, ArtX entered into a partnership with Nintendo to undertake the complete design of the system logic and graphics processor, codenamed &quot;Flipper),&quot; for Nintendo&#x27;s sixth-generation video game console. The console went through a series of codenames, including N2000, Star Cube, and Nintendo Advance. On May 12, 1999, Nintendo publicly announced the console during a press conference, giving it the codename &quot;Dolphin&quot; and positioning it as the successor to the Nintendo 64. This announcement also revealed strategic partnerships with IBM for the creation of Dolphin&#x27;s PowerPC-based CPU, codenamed &quot;Gekko,&quot; and with Panasonic (Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.) for the development of its DVD drive and other Dolphin-based devices. Following this announcement, Nintendo began providing development kits to game developers, including Rare and Retro Studios.

In April 2000, ArtX was acquired by ATI, whereupon the Flipper graphics processor design had already been mostly completed by ArtX and was not overtly influenced by ATI. In total, ArtX cofounder Greg Buchner recalled that their portion of the console&#x27;s hardware design timeline had arced from inception in 1998 to completion in 2000. Of the ArtX acquisition, an ATI spokesperson said, &quot;ATI now becomes a major supplier to the game console market via Nintendo. The Dolphin platform is reputed to be king of the hill in terms of graphics and video performance with 128-bit architecture.&quot;

The console was announced as the GameCube at a press conference in Japan on August 25, 2000, abbreviated as both &quot;NGC&quot; and &quot;GC&quot; in Japan and &quot;GCN&quot; in Europe and North America. Nintendo unveiled its software lineup for the console at E3 2001, focusing on fifteen launch games, including &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader&quot;. Several games originally scheduled to launch with the console were delayed. It is also the first Nintendo home console since the Famicom not to have a &quot;Mario&quot; launch game.

Long before the console&#x27;s launch, Nintendo had developed and patented an early prototype of motion controls for the GameCube, with which developer Factor 5 had experimented for its launch games. Greg Thomas, Sega of America&#x27;s VP of Development said, &quot;What does worry me is Dolphin&#x27;s sensory controllers [which are rumored to include microphones and headphone jacks] because there&#x27;s an example of someone thinking about something different.&quot; These motion control concepts would not be deployed to consumers for several years, until the Wii Remote.

Prior to the GameCube&#x27;s release, Nintendo focused resources on the launch of the Game Boy Advance, a handheld game console and successor to the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color. As a result, several games originally destined for the Nintendo 64 console were postponed to become early releases on the GameCube. Concurrently, Nintendo was developing GameCube software provisioning future connectivity with the Game Boy Advance. Certain games, such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot;, can use the handheld as a secondary screen and controller when connected to the console via a link cable.

Nintendo began its marketing campaign with the catchphrase &quot;The Nintendo Difference&quot; at its E3 2001 reveal. The goal was to distinguish itself from the competition as an entertainment company. Later advertisements have the slogan, &quot;Born to Play&quot;, and game ads feature a rotating cube animation that morphs into a GameCube logo and end with a voice whispering, &quot;GameCube&quot;. On May 21, 2001, the console&#x27;s launch price of was announced, lower than that of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Nintendo spent $76 million marketing the GameCube.

In September 2020, leaked documents included Nintendo&#x27;s plans for a GameCube model that would be both portable with a built-in display and dockable to a TV, similar to its later console the Nintendo Switch. Other leaks suggest plans for a GameCube successor, codenamed Tako, with HD graphics and slots for SD and memory cards, apparently resulting from a partnership with ATI and scheduled for release in 2005.

=== Release ===

The GameCube was launched in Japan on September 14, 2001. Approximately 500,000 units were shipped in time to retailers. The console was scheduled to launch two months later in North America on November 5, 2001, but the date was pushed back in an effort to increase the number of available units. The console eventually launched in North America on November 18, 2001, with over 700,000 units shipped to the region. Other regions followed suit the following year beginning with Europe in the second quarter of 2002.

On April 22, 2002, veteran third-party Nintendo console developer Factor 5 announced its 3D audio software development kit titled MusyX. In collaboration with Dolby Laboratories, MusyX provides motion-based surround sound encoded as Dolby Pro Logic II.

===Market share===
Throughout the mid 2000s, GameCube hardware sales remained far behind its direct competitor the PlayStation 2, and slightly behind the Xbox, though there were brief periods when the console would outsell both. The console&#x27;s family-friendly appeal and lack of support from certain third-party developers skewed the GameCube toward a younger market, which was a minority of the gaming population during the sixth-generation. Many third-party games popular with teenagers or adults, such as the blockbuster &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series and several key first-person shooters, skipped the GameCube entirely in favor of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. However, many gaming journalists and analysts noted that Nintendo&#x27;s primary focus on younger audiences, and its family-friendly image, was the biggest advantage and disadvantage at a time when video games were aimed at more mature audiences. Nintendo was successful with games aimed at a more mature audience.

, the GameCube had a 13% market share, tying with the Xbox in sales but far below the 60% of the PlayStation 2. However, despite slow sales and tough competition, Nintendo&#x27;s position improved by 2003 and 2004. The American market share for the GameCube had gone up from 19% to 37% in one year alone due to price cuts and high-quality games. One article stated that by early 2004, the GameCube had 39% market share in America. By Christmas of 2003, Nintendo of America&#x27;s president, George Harrison, reported that the company&#x27;s price cuts down to just under $100 quadrupled sales in the American market. GameCube&#x27;s profitability never reached that of the PlayStation 2 or Game Boy Advance. However, it was more profitable than the Xbox.

GameCube&#x27;s first two years had slow sales and struggles, and by 2004 and 2005 vastly improved to a 32% share of the hardware market in Europe. Due to price drops, which saved it in the American markets, and high-quality games from various developers, such as &quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, the GameCube improved to put Xbox down to third place. The top three European countries for GameCube success included the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and modestly in Spain and Italy. Though falling behind the PlayStation 2 in Europe, the GameCube was successful and profitable there.

=== Discontinuation ===
Nintendo launched the Wii, the home console successor to the GameCube, on November 19, 2006, in North America and in December 2006 in other regions. In February 2007, Nintendo announced that it had ceased first-party support for the GameCube and that the console had been discontinued, as it was shifting its manufacturing and development efforts towards the Wii and Nintendo DS. GameCube controllers, game discs, and certain accessories continued to be supported via the Wii&#x27;s backward compatibility, although this feature was removed in later iterations of the Wii console. The final game officially released on the GameCube was &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot;, on August 14, 2007. Several games originally developed for the GameCube were either reworked for a Wii release, such as &quot;Super Paper Mario&quot;, or released on both consoles, such as the Wii launch game &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot;.

GameCube controllers continued to be supported via backward compatibility on Nintendo&#x27;s next consoles, the Wii U, and Nintendo Switch, with the GameCube controller adapter in 2014&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot; and 2018&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. While on the Wii U the controller was only allowed to be used in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, the Nintendo Switch recognizes it as a Pro Controller. Thus, the GameCube Controller can be used in any game where the Pro Controller is recognized. However, due to the GameCube controller lacking motion controls and some buttons, it may not be fully playable in some Switch games.

== Hardware ==

Howard Cheng, technical director of Nintendo technology development, said the company&#x27;s goal was to select a &quot;simple RISC architecture&quot; to help speed the development of games by making it easier on software developers. IGN reported that the system was &quot;designed from the get-go to attract third-party developers by offering more power at a cheaper price. Nintendo&#x27;s design document for the console specifies that cost is of utmost importance, followed by space.&quot; Hardware partner ArtX&#x27;s Vice President Greg Buchner stated that their guiding thought on the console&#x27;s hardware design was to target the developers rather than the players, and to &quot;look into a crystal ball&quot; and discern &quot;what&#x27;s going to allow the Miyamoto-sans of the world to develop the best games&quot;.

Initiating the GameCube&#x27;s design in 1998, Nintendo partnered with ArtX (then acquired by ATI Technologies during development) for the system logic and the GPU, and with IBM for the CPU. IBM designed a 32-bit PowerPC-based processor with custom architectural extensions for the next-generation console, known as Gekko, which runs at 486 MHz and features a floating point unit (FPU) capable of a total throughput of 1.9 GFLOPS and a peak of 10.5 GFLOPS. Described as &quot;an extension of the IBM PowerPC architecture&quot;, the Gekko CPU is based on the PowerPC 750CXe with IBM&#x27;s 0.18μm CMOS technology, which features copper interconnects. Codenamed Flipper, the GPU runs at 162 MHz, and in addition to graphics manages other tasks through its audio and input/output (I/O) processors.

The GameCube is Nintendo&#x27;s first console to not use primarily cartridge media, following the Famicom Data Recorder, Famicom Disk System, SNES-CD, and 64DD which represent past explorations of complementary storage technologies. The GameCube introduced a proprietary miniDVD optical disc format for up to 1.5 GB of data. It was designed by Matsushita Electric Industrial (now Panasonic Corporation) with a proprietary copy-protection scheme unlike the Content Scramble System (CSS) in standard DVDs. The size is sufficient for most games, although a few multi-platform games require an extra disc, higher video compression, or removal of content. By comparison, the PlayStation 2 and Xbox use CDs and DVDs up to 8.5 GB.
Like its predecessor, the Nintendo 64, GameCube models were produced in several different color motifs. The system launched in &quot;Indigo&quot;, the primary color shown in advertising and on the logo, and in &quot;Jet Black&quot;. One year later, Nintendo released a &quot;Platinum&quot; limited-edition GameCube, which uses a silver color scheme for both the console and controller. A &quot;Spice&quot; orange-colored console was eventually released only in Japan, though that scheme is only on controllers released in other countries.

Nintendo developed stereoscopic 3D technology for the GameCube, supported by one launch game, &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;. However, the feature never reached production. 3D televisions were not widespread, and it was deemed that compatible displays and crystals for the add-on accessories would be too cost-prohibitive for the consumer. Two audio Easter eggs can be invoked when the power is activated with the &quot;Z&quot; button on the Player 1 controller held down, or with four controllers connected and holding down the &quot;Z&quot; buttons.
The GameCube features two memory card ports for saving game data. Nintendo released three memory card options: Memory Card 59 in gray (512 KB), Memory Card 251 in black (2 MB), and Memory Card 1019 in white (8 MB). These are often advertised in megabits instead: 4 Mb, 16 Mb, and 64 Mb, respectively. Memory cards with larger capacities were released by third-party manufacturers.

=== Controller ===
Nintendo learned from its experiences—both positive and negative—with the Nintendo 64&#x27;s three-handled controller design and chose a two-handled, &quot;handlebar&quot; design for the GameCube. The shape was popularized by Sony&#x27;s PlayStation controller released in 1994 and its follow-up DualShock series in 1997 with vibration feedback and two analog sticks to improve the 3D experience. Nintendo and Microsoft designed similar features in the controllers for their sixth-generation consoles, but instead of having the analog sticks in parallel, they are staggered by swapping the positions of the directional pad (d-pad) and left analog stick. The GameCube controller features a total of eight buttons, two analog sticks, a d-pad, and a rumble motor. The primary analog stick is on the left with the d-pad located below and closer to the center. On the right are four buttons: a large, green &quot;A&quot; button in the center, a smaller red &quot;B&quot; button to the left, an &quot;X&quot; button to the right, and a &quot;Y&quot; button at the top. Below and to the inside is a yellow &quot;C&quot; analog stick, which often serves a variety of in-game functions, such as controlling the camera angle. The Start/Pause button is located in the middle, and the rumble motor is encased within the center of the controller.

On the top are two &quot;pressure-sensitive&quot; trigger buttons marked &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot;. Each essentially provides two functions: one analog and one digital. As the trigger is depressed, it emits an increasing analog signal. Once fully depressed, the trigger &quot;clicks&quot; with a digital signal that a game can use for a separate function. There is also a purple, digital button on the right side marked &quot;Z&quot;.

The A button has a uniquely prominent size and placement, having been the primary action button in past Nintendo controller designs. The rubberized analog stick, within the overall button orientation, addresses &quot;Nintendo thumb&quot; pain.

In 2002, Nintendo introduced the WaveBird Wireless Controller, the first wireless gamepad developed by a first-party console manufacturer. The RF-based wireless controller is similar in design to the standard controller. It communicates with the GameCube with a wireless receiver dongle. Powered by two AA batteries, it lacks vibration.
=== Compatibility ===
The GameCube uses GameCube Game Discs, and the Game Boy Player accessory runs Game Pak cartridges for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance. The original version of the GameCube&#x27;s successor, the Wii, supports backward compatibility with GameCube controllers, memory cards, and games but not the Game Boy Player or other hardware attachments. However, later revisions of the Wii—including the &quot;Family Edition&quot; released in 2011 and the Wii Mini released in 2012—do not support any GameCube hardware or software.

=== Panasonic Q ===

The is a hybrid version of the GameCube with a standard DVD player, developed by Panasonic in a strategic alliance with Nintendo to develop the optical drive for the original GameCube hardware. Its stainless steel case is completely revised with a DVD-sized front-loading tray, a backlit LCD screen with playback controls, and a carrying handle like the GameCube. Announced by Panasonic on October 19, 2001, it was released exclusively in Japan on December 14 at a suggested retail price of ¥39,800; however, low sales resulted in Panasonic announcing the discontinuation of the Q on December 18, 2003. The Q supports CDs, DVDs, and GameCube discs but there is virtually no integration between the GameCube and DVD player modes.

== Games ==

In its lifespan from 2001 to 2007, Nintendo licensed over 600 GameCube games. Nintendo bolstered the console&#x27;s popularity by creating new franchises, such as &quot;Pikmin&quot; and &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, and renewing some that had skipped the Nintendo 64, such as with &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;. Longer standing franchises include the critically acclaimed &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;, and the GameCube&#x27;s best-selling game, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, at 7 million copies worldwide. Other Nintendo games are successors to Nintendo 64 games, such as &quot;F-Zero GX&quot;; &quot;Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour&quot;; &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot;; &quot;Mario Party 4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, and &quot;7&quot;; &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot;; and &quot;Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&quot;. Though committed to its software library, Nintendo was still criticized for not releasing enough launch window games and by the release of &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; instead of a 3D &quot;Mario&quot; game.

Nintendo had struggled with its family-friendly image during the late 1990s and most of the 2000s. However, during this period, it released more video games for a mature audience with mostly successful results. While the video game industry was focusing on more mature audiences and online connections, Nintendo regained older players who had gravitated to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox during the early 2000s. Some games aimed at older audiences were critically and financially successfulmore than on Dreamcast, and less than on PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Such examples include &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;, &quot;Killer7&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (2002), &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, &quot;Metroid Prime II: Echoes&quot;, &quot;Soul Calibur II&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil Zero&quot;, &quot;F-Zero GX&quot;, &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot;, and &quot;Star Fox Assault&quot;. One of the most well-known GameCube games for mature audiences is &quot;Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem&quot;, which underperformed financially, but garnered critical acclaim and is now regarded as a cult classic.

The GameCube is Nintendo&#x27;s first home console with a system menu, activated by powering on without a valid game disc or by holding down the A button while one is loaded.

=== Third-party support ===
Early in Nintendo&#x27;s history, the company had achieved considerable success with third-party developer support on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES. Competition from the Sega Genesis and Sony PlayStation in the 1990s changed the market&#x27;s landscape and reduced Nintendo&#x27;s ability to obtain exclusive, third-party support on the Nintendo 64. The Nintendo 64 Game Pak cartridge format increased the cost to manufacture software, as opposed to the cheaper, higher-capacity optical discs on PlayStation.

With the GameCube, Nintendo intended to reverse the trend as evidenced by the number of third-party games available at launch. The new optical disc format increased game storage capacity significantly and reduced production costs. Successful exclusives include &quot;Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader&quot; from Factor 5, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; from Capcom, and &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot; from Konami. Sega discontinued its Dreamcast console to become a third-party developer, porting Dreamcast games such as &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; and &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, and developing new franchises, such as &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot;. Longtime Nintendo partner Rare, which had developed &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, and the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series, released &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; for GameCube, its final Nintendo game before acquisition by Microsoft in 2002. Several third-party developers were contracted to work on new games for Nintendo franchises, including &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot; (which became a Player&#x27;s Choice re-release), &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; by Namco, and &quot;Wario World&quot; from Treasure. Capcom had announced 5 games for the system dubbed the Capcom Five in November 2002, &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; were later ported to other systems.

Third-party GameCube support was some of the most extensive of any Nintendo console predating the Wii. Some third-party developers, such as Midway, Namco, Activision, Konami, Ubisoft, THQ, Disney Interactive Studios, Humongous Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and EA Sports, continued to release GameCube games into 2007. One of the biggest third-party GameCube developers was Sega, which had quit the console hardware market to become a third-party game developer after the failure of the Dreamcast. It partnered with long-time rival Nintendo, and with Microsoft and Sony, to recuperate profits lost from the Dreamcast. Sega was a successful third-party developer since the early 2000s, mostly those for the family market, such as &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;, &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Sonic Adventure 2: Battle&quot;, and &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;.

=== Online gaming ===
Nintendo&#x27;s GameCube did not put heavy focus on online games earlier in the console&#x27;s life. Only eight GameCube games support network connectivity, five with Internet support and three with local area network (LAN) support. The only Internet capable games released in western territories are three role-playing games (RPGs) in Sega&#x27;s &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; series: &quot;Phantasy Star Online Episode I &amp; II&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star Online Episode I &amp; II Plus&quot;, and &quot;Phantasy Star Online Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution&quot;. The official servers were decommissioned in 2007, but players can still connect to fan maintained private servers. Japan received two additional games with Internet capabilities, a cooperative RPG, &quot;Homeland&quot; and a baseball game with downloadable content, &quot;Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū 10&quot;. Lastly, three racing games have LAN multiplayer modes: &quot;1080° Avalanche&quot;, &quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot;, and &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot;. Those can be forced over the Internet with third-party PC software capable of tunneling the GameCube&#x27;s network traffic.

Online play requires an official broadband or modem adapter because the GameCube lacks out of the box network capabilities. Nintendo never commissioned any Internet services for GameCube, but allowed other publishers to manage custom online experiences.

== Reception ==
The GameCube received mixed reviews following its launch. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; praised the overall hardware design and quality of games available at launch. CNET gave an average review rating, noting that though the console lacks a few features offered by its competition, it is relatively inexpensive, has a great controller design, and launched a decent lineup of games. In later reviews, criticism mounted against the console often centering on its overall look and feel, describing it as &quot;toy-ish&quot;. With poor sales figures and the associated financial harm to Nintendo, a &quot;Time International&quot; article called the GameCube an &quot;unmitigated disaster&quot;.

Retrospectively, Joystiq compared the GameCube&#x27;s launch window to its successor, the Wii, noting that the GameCube&#x27;s &quot;lack of games&quot; resulted in a subpar launch, and the console&#x27;s limited selection of online games damaged its market share in the long run. &quot;Time International&quot; concluded that the system had low sales figures, because it lacked &quot;technical innovations&quot;.

=== Sales ===
In Japan, between 280,000 and 300,000 GameCube consoles were sold during the first three days of its sale, out of an initial shipment of 450,000 units. During its launch weekend, $100 million worth of GameCube products were sold in North America. The console was sold out in several stores, faster than initial sales of both of its competitors, the Xbox and the PlayStation 2. Nintendo reported that the most popular launch game is &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;, with more sales at its launch than &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; had. Other popular games include &quot;Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader&quot; and &quot;Wave Race: Blue Storm&quot;. By early December 2001, 600,000 units had been sold in the US.

Nintendo predicted 50 million GameCube units by 2005, but only sold 22 million GameCube units worldwide during its lifespan, placing it slightly behind the Xbox&#x27;s 24 million, though it did manage to outsell the Xbox in Japan, and well behind the PlayStation 2&#x27;s 155 million. &quot;Ars Technica&quot; articles from 2006 showed and a 2020 book show that Nintendo had officially sold 24 million GameCube consoles worldwide, and one article from &quot;Seeking Alpha&quot; shows that the GameCube sold 26 million consoles worldwide. Its sales exceeded that of the Xbox 360 in Japan. The GameCube&#x27;s predecessor, the Nintendo 64, also outperformed it at nearly 33 million units. It also exceeded the Dreamcast, which yielded 9.13 million units. In September 2009, IGN ranked the GameCube 16th in its list of best gaming consoles of all time, placing it behind all three of its sixth-generation competitors: the PlayStation 2 (3rd), the Dreamcast (8th), and the Xbox (11th). As of March 31, 2003, 9.55 million GameCube units had been sold worldwide, behind Nintendo&#x27;s initial goal of 10 million consoles. Many of Nintendo&#x27;s own first-party games, such as &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Colosseum&quot;, and &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot;, had strong sales, though this did not typically benefit third-party developers or directly drive sales of their games. However, at the same time, these first-party games, and second-party and third-party games, elevated the GameCube.

Sales of many cross-platform games—such as sports franchises released by Electronic Arts—were far below their PlayStation 2 and Xbox counterparts, eventually prompting some developers to scale back or completely cease support for the GameCube. Exceptions include Sega&#x27;s family friendly &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; and &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot;, which reportedly yielded more sales on GameCube than most of the company&#x27;s games on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. In June 2003, Acclaim Entertainment CEO Rod Cousens said that the company would no longer support the GameCube, and criticized it as a system &quot;that don&#x27;t deliver profits&quot;. Acclaim would later rescind his claims, by saying the company would elevate support for the system. This decision was made unclear after the company filed for bankruptcy in August 2004. In September 2003, Eidos Interactive announced to end support for the GameCube, as the publisher was losing money from developing for Nintendo&#x27;s console. This led to several games in development being canceled for the system. Eidos&#x27;s CEO Mike McGravey would say that the GameCube was a &quot;declining business&quot;. However, after the company&#x27;s purchase by the SCi Entertainment Group in 2005, Eidos resumed development for the system and released &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Video Game&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider: Legend&quot;.

In March 2003, British retailer Dixons removed all GameCube consoles, accessories and games from its stores. That same month, another British retailer Argos, cut the price of the GameCube in their stores to £78.99, which was more than £50 cheaper than Nintendo&#x27;s SRP for the console at the time. However, in October of that year, they did eventually restock their supply of consoles after a price drop was ordered which caused the console sales to outpace the PlayStation 2 for a week.

With sales sagging and millions of unsold consoles in stock, Nintendo halted GameCube production for the first nine months of 2003 to reduce surplus units. Sales rebounded slightly after a price drop to US$99.99 on September 24, 2003 and the release of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; bundle. A demo disc, the &quot;GameCube Preview Disc&quot;, was also released in a bundle in 2003. Beginning with this period, GameCube sales continued to be steady, particularly in Japan, but the GameCube remained in third place in worldwide sales during the sixth-generation era because of weaker sales performance elsewhere, though its fortunes would change for the better in America and Europe.

Iwata forecasted to investors that the company would sell 50 million GameCube units worldwide by March 2005, but by the end of 2006, it had only sold 21.74 millionfewer than half. However, it had the highest attach rate of any Nintendo console at 9.59 and was profitable, even more than Xbox with higher sales rates.

=== Legacy ===
Many games that debuted on the GameCube, including the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series, &quot;Chibi-Robo!&quot;, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, and &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; became popular and profitable Nintendo franchises or subseries.

GameCube controllers have limited support on Wii U and Switch, to play &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; respectively, via a USB adapter. While on the Wii U the controller was only allowed to be used in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, the Nintendo Switch recognizes it as a Pro Controller. Thus, the GameCube Controller can be used in any game where the Pro Controller is recognized. However, due to the GameCube controller lacking motion controls and some buttons, it may not be fully playable in some Switch games.

Regarding concerns about the correlation between violence and video games, a 2009 study by Iowa State University found that certain games like &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Chibi-Robo!&quot;, which were GameCube exclusives, would help players learn positive skills about helping others, empathy, and cooperation. The game &quot;Super Monkey Ball&quot;, which was a GameCube exclusive, could help surgeons perform laparoscopic surgery better than surgeons who do not play video games.

&quot;GamesRadar+&quot; ranked it 11th on their list of The 20 best video game consoles and hardware of all time in 2021. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; placed it at number 12 on their list of The 25 Best Video Game Consoles Ever, Ranked, in 2023.

<doc id="53528" wikidata="Q48373" url="?curid=53528" title="David Livingstone">
<text>David Livingstone (; 19 March 1813 – 1 May 1873) was a Scottish physician, Congregationalist, pioneer Christian missionary with the London Missionary Society, and an explorer in Africa. Livingstone was married to Mary Moffat Livingstone, from the prominent 18th-century Moffat missionary family. Livingstone came to have a mythic status that operated on a number of interconnected levels: Protestant missionary martyr, working-class &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; inspirational story, scientific investigator and explorer, imperial reformer, anti-slavery crusader, and advocate of British commercial and colonial expansion. As a result, Livingstone became one of the most popular British heroes of the late 19th-century Victorian era.

Livingstone&#x27;s fame as an explorer and his obsession with learning the sources of the Nile was founded on the belief that if he could solve that age-old mystery, his fame would give him the influence to end the East African Arab–Swahili slave trade. &quot;The Nile sources&quot;, he told a friend, &quot;are valuable only as a means of opening my mouth with power among men. It is this power [with] which I hope to remedy an immense evil.&quot; His subsequent exploration of the central African watershed was the culmination of the classic period of European geographical discovery and colonial penetration of Africa. At the same time, his missionary travels, &quot;disappearance&quot;, and eventual death in Africaand subsequent glorification as a posthumous national hero in 1874led to the founding of several major central African Christian missionary initiatives carried forward in the era of the European &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;.

==Early life==
Livingstone was born on 19 March 1813 in the mill town of Blantyre, Scotland, in a tenement building for the workers of a cotton factory on the banks of the River Clyde under the bridge crossing into Bothwell. He was the second of seven children born to Neil Livingstone (1788–1856) and his wife Agnes (née Hunter; 1782–1865).

David was employed at the age of ten in the cotton mill of Henry Monteith &amp; Co. in Blantyre Works. He and his brother John worked 14-hour days as piecers, tying broken cotton threads on the spinning machines.

Neil Livingstone was a Sunday school teacher and teetotaller who handed out Christian tracts on his travels as a door-to-door tea salesman. He read books on theology, travel, and missionary enterprises extensively. This rubbed off on the young David, who became an avid reader, but he also loved scouring the countryside for animal, plant, and geological specimens in local limestone quarries. Neil feared that science books were undermining Christianity and attempted to force his son to read nothing but theology, but David&#x27;s deep interest in nature and science led him to investigate the relationship between religion and science. In 1832, he read &quot;Philosophy of a Future State&quot;, written by Thomas Dick, and he found the rationale that he needed to reconcile faith and science and, apart from the Bible, this book was perhaps his greatest philosophical influence.

Other significant influences in his early life were Thomas Burke, a Blantyre evangelist, and David Hogg, his Sunday school teacher. At age fifteen, David left the Church of Scotland for a local Congregational church, influenced by preachers like Ralph Wardlaw, who denied predestinarian limitations on salvation. Influenced by revivalistic teachings in the United States, Livingstone entirely accepted the proposition put by Charles Finney, Professor of Theology at Oberlin College, Ohio, that &quot;the Holy Spirit is open to all who ask it&quot;. For Livingstone, this meant a release from the fear of eternal damnation. Livingstone&#x27;s reading of missionary Karl Gützlaff&#x27;s &quot;Appeal to the Churches of Britain and America on behalf of China&quot; enabled him to persuade his father that medical study could advance religious ends.

Livingstone&#x27;s experiences in H. Monteith&#x27;s Blantyre cotton mill were also important from ages 10 to 26, first as a piecer and later as a spinner. This monotonous work was necessary to support his impoverished family, but it taught him persistence, endurance, and a natural empathy with all who labour, as expressed by lines that he used to hum from the egalitarian Robert Burns song: &quot;When man to man, the world o&#x27;er/Shall brothers be for a&#x27; that&quot;.

==Education==
Livingstone attended Blantyre village school, along with the few other mill children with the endurance to do so despite their 14-hour workday (6 am–8 pm). Having a family with a strong, continuing commitment to study reinforced his education.

At the age of 21, he was excited by a pamphlet his father got from the church setting out Gützlaff&#x27;s call for missionaries to China, with the new concept that missionaries should be trained as medical doctors. His father was persuaded and, like many other students in Scotland, Livingstone was to support himself, with the agreement of the mill management, by working at his old job from Easter to October, outwith term time. He joined Anderson&#x27;s University, Glasgow, in 1836, studying medicine and chemistry, as well as attending theology lectures by the anti-slavery campaigner Richard Wardlaw at the Congregational Church College, where he may also have studied Greek.
To enter medical school, he needed some knowledge of Latin, and was tutored by a local Roman Catholic man, Daniel Gallagher (later a priest, founder of St Simon&#x27;s, Partick). Livingstone worked hard, got a good grounding in science and medicine, and made lifelong friends including Andrew Buchanan and James Young.

The London Missionary Society (LMS) was at the time the major organisation in the country for missionary work, and unlike others was open to Congregationalists. He applied to the LMS in October 1837, and in January was sent questions which he answered. He got no reply until invited to two interviews in August 1838. He was then accepted as a probationary candidate, and given initial training at Ongar, Essex, as the introduction to studies to become a minister within the Congregational Union serving under the LMS, rather than the more basic course for an artisan missionary. At Ongar, he and six other students had tuition in Greek, Latin, Hebrew and theology from the Reverend Richard Cecil, who in January 1839 assessed that, despite &quot;heaviness of manner&quot; and &quot;rusticity&quot;, Livingstone had &quot;sense and quiet vigour&quot;, good temper and substantial character &quot;so I do not like the thought of him being rejected.&quot; A month later, he still thought Livingstone &quot;hardly ready&quot; to go on to theological studies at Cheshunt College, and &quot;worthy but remote from brilliant&quot;. In June 1839 the LMS directors accepted Livingstone, and agreed to his request to continue studying with Cecil at Ongar until the end of the year, then have LMS support for medical studies in London.

To gain necessary clinical training he continued his medical studies at the Charing Cross Hospital Medical School, with his courses covering medical practice, midwifery, and botany.
He qualified as a licentiate of the Faculty (now Royal College) of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow on 16 November 1840 (in 1857 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Faculty). On 20 November 1840 Livingstone was ordained a minister of the church, as was another missionary to South Africa, William Ross, in a service at the Albion Chapel, Finsbury. The ordination service was conducted by Cecil and J. J. Freeman.

==Vision for Africa==

Though Livingstone had responded to Gützlaff&#x27;s call for missionaries to China, the looming First Opium War made the LMS directors cautious about sending recruits there. When he asked to extend his probationary training at Ongar, Cecil told him of their wish that he should be employed in the West Indies &quot;in preference to South Africa&quot;. On 2 July 1839 he wrote to the LMS directors that the West Indies was by then well served by doctors, and he had always been attracted to other parts of the world rather than a settled pastorate. With LMS agreement, he continued to get theological tuition from Cecil until the end of the year, then resumed medical studies.

On beginning his clinical training in January 1840, he returned to Mrs. Sewell&#x27;s missionary boarding house in Aldersgate, where he had stayed previously when in London.
Others staying there were visited occasionally by the missionary Robert Moffat, who was then in England with his family to publicise the work of his LMS mission at Kuruman in South Africa. Livingstone questioned him repeatedly about Africa, and as Moffat later recalled; &quot;By and by he asked me whether I thought he would do for Africa. I said I believed he would, if he would not go to an old station, but would advance to unoccupied ground, specifying the vast plain to the north, where I had sometimes seen, in the morning sun, the smoke of a thousand villages, where no missionary had ever been.&quot;

He was excited by Moffat&#x27;s vision of expanding missionary work to the north of Bechuanaland, and by the hotly debated topic of Christianity and commerce. The LMS missionary John Philip, after discussion with the abolitionist Fowell Buxton, published &quot;Researches in South Africa&quot; in 1828, proposing that Christianity would always bring &quot;civilisation&quot; including free trade and free labour. This argument was reinforced for Livingstone when he attended the Exeter Hall meeting of 1 June 1840 where Buxton powerfully made the case that the African slave trade would be ended if chiefs, instead of having to sell slaves, could obtain desired European goods through &quot;legitimate trade&quot;, its effect augmented by Christian missions preaching the gospel and introducing school education.

===Mission stations===
Livingstone left London on 17 November 1840, passenger on a sailing brig bound for the Cape of Good Hope, along with two other LMS missionaries: Ross, who had been ordained at the same service as him, and Ross&#x27;s wife. During the long voyage he studied Dutch and Tswana language, and the captain gave him extensive tuition in navigation. At Rio de Janeiro, unlike the other two, he ventured ashore and was impressed by the cathedral and scenery, but not by drunkenness of British and American sailors so he gave them tracts in a dockside bar.
On 15 March 1841 the ship arrived at Simon&#x27;s Bay, and for a month while it unloaded and loaded, the three stayed at Cape Town with Mr and Mrs Philip. As resident director of the LMS, Philip had continued their policy that all people were equal before God and in law, leading to disputes with Boers, and with British settlers as Philip held that Xhosa people were not to blame for the Xhosa Wars over extending the Cape Colony. Missionary factions disagreed over this, and over his emphasis on missionary work among Griqua people of the colony, while others like Moffatt wanted more focus on new areas. There were also tensions between artisan missionaries engaged for lay expertise, and ordained missionaries.

The ship took Livingstone and the Rosses on to Algoa Bay, from 19 May to 31 July they were on the long trek by ox-cart to the Kuruman Mission. The Moffats had not yet returned from Britain, and he immersed himself in Tswana life. From September to late December he trekked with the artisan missionary Roger Edwards, who had been at Kuruman since 1830 and had been told by Moffat to investigate potential for a new station. They visited and discussed the area called Mabotsa, Botswana, near Zeerust, North West Province, South Africa.

In 1842 Livingstone went on two treks with African companions, the principals were mission members Paul and Mebalwe, a deacon. In June 1843, Edwards got LMS approval to set up a mission station with his wife at Mabotsa. Livingstone moved there by agreement, and joined them in the physical work of building facilities. He wrote to tell LMS secretary Arthur Tidman, saying he would be delighted to call Mabotsa &quot;the centre of the sphere of my labours&quot;, but would try to hold himself &quot;in readiness to go anywhere, provided it be forward&quot;.

The Moffats, accompanied by two new missionary families, reached the Vaal River in January 1844, Livingstone rode out to meet them there, then sat in the Moffats&#x27; ox-cart talking with Robert for hours during the seventeen or eighteen days it took to get home to Kuruman. For the first time, he met their daughter Mary, who had been born and brought up in Africa.

Lions often attacked the herds of the Mabotsa villagers, and on 16 February, Mebalwe and Livingstone joined them defending sheep. Livingstone got a clear shot at a large lion, but while he was re-loading it attacked, crushing his left arm, and forced him to the ground. His life was saved by Mebalwe diverting its attention by trying to shoot the lion. He too got bitten. A man who tried spearing it was attacked just before it dropped dead.

Livingstone&#x27;s broken bone, even though inexpertly set by himself and Edwards, bonded strongly. He went for recuperation to Kuruman, where he was tended by Moffat&#x27;s daughter Mary, and they became engaged. His arm healed, enabling him to shoot and lift heavy weights, though it remained a source of much suffering for the rest of his life, and he was not able to lift the arm higher than his shoulder.

Livingstone and Mary were married on 9 January 1845.

Livingstone was obliged to leave his first mission at Mabotsa in Botswana in 1845 after irreconcilable differences emerged between him and his fellow missionary, Rogers Edwards, and because the Bakgatla were proving indifferent to the Gospel. He abandoned Chonuane, his next mission, in 1847 because of drought and the proximity of the Boers and his desire &quot;to move on to the regions beyond&quot;. At Kolobeng Mission Livingstone converted Chief Sechele in 1849 after two years of patient persuasion. Only a few months later Sechele lapsed.

==Exploration of southern and central Africa==
To improve his Tswana language skills and find locations to set up mission stations, Livingstone made journeys far to the north of Kolobeng with William Cotton Oswell. In 1849 they crossed the Kalahari Desert and reached Lake Ngami. In 1850, he was recognised by the Royal Geographical Society which presented him a chronometer watch for &#x27;his journey to the great lake of Ngami&#x27;. He heard of a river which could potentially become a &quot;Highway&quot; to the coast, and in August 1851 they reached the Zambezi which he hoped would be a &quot;key to the Interior&quot;.
In 1852, after sending his family to Britain, Livingstone travelled north to the village of Linyanti on the Zambezi river, located roughly midway between the east and west coast of the continent, where Sekeletu, chief of the Kololo, granted Livingstone authority as a nduna to lead a joint investigation of trade routes to the coast, with 27 Kololo warriors acting as interpreters and guides. They reached the Portuguese city of Luanda on the Atlantic in May 1854 after profound difficulties and the near-death of Livingstone from fever. Livingstone realized the route would be too difficult for future traders, so he retraced the journey back to Linyanti. Then with 114 Kololo men, loaned by the same chief, he set off east down the Zambezi. On this leg he became the first European to see the Mosi-oa-Tunya (&quot;the smoke that thunders&quot;) waterfall, which he named Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria. Eventually he successfully reached Quelimane on the Indian Ocean, having mapped most of the course of the Zambezi river.

For this, Livingstone became famous as the first European to cross south-central Africa at that latitude and was hailed as having &quot;opened up&quot; Africa, but there was already a long-established trans-regional network of trade routes. Portuguese traders had penetrated to the middle of the continent from both sides, in 1853–1854 two Arab traders crossed the continent from Zanzibar to Benguela, and around 1800 two native traders crossed from Angola to Mozambique.

Livingstone advocated the establishment of trade and religious missions in central Africa, but abolition of the African slave trade, as carried out by the Portuguese of Tete and the Arab Swahili of Kilwa, became his primary goal. His motto—now inscribed on his statue at Victoria Falls—was &quot;&quot;, a combination that he hoped would form an alternative to the slave trade, and impart dignity to the Africans in the eyes of Europeans. He believed that the key to achieving these goals was the navigation of the Zambezi River as a Christian commercial highway into the interior.

===Author and campaigner===
He returned to Britain in December 1856. The Royal Geographical Society awarded him their Patron&#x27;s Medal in 1855 for his explorations in Africa. Encouraged by the London Missionary Society, he wrote up his journal, but unconventionally had his &quot;Missionary Travels&quot; published in 1857 by John Murray, making it a bestselling travelogue. The book included his field science and exceptionally sympathetic descriptions of African people. He proposed that missions and &quot;legitimate commerce&quot; by river into central Africa would end slave trading.

Livingstone was encouraged by the response in Britain to his discoveries and support for future expeditions. He proposed to do more exploration, primarily to find routes for commercial trade which he believed would displace slave trade routes, more so than for solely missionary work. The London Missionary Society (LMS) on learning of his plans sent a letter which Livingstone received at Quelimane, congratulating him on his journey but said that the directors were &quot;restricted in their power of aiding plans connected only remotely with the spread of the Gospel&quot;. This brusque rejection for new mission stations north of the Zambezi and his wider object of opening the interior for trade via the Zambezi, was not enough to make him resign from the LMS at once. When Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society, put him in touch with the foreign secretary, Livingstone said nothing to the LMS directors, even when his leadership of a government expedition to the Zambezi seemed increasingly likely to be funded by the exchequer. &quot;I am not yet fairly on with the Government,&quot; he told a friend, &quot;but am nearly quite off with the Society (LMS).&quot; Livingstone resigned from the London Missionary Society in 1857, and in May of that year he was appointed as her majesty&#x27;s consul with a roving commission, extending through Mozambique to the areas west of it. In February 1858 his area of jurisdiction was stipulated to be &quot;the Eastern Coast of Africa and the independent districts in the interior&quot;.

While he negotiated with the government for his new position as consul, the LMS thought that he would return to Africa with their mission to the Kololo in Barotseland, which Livingstone had promoted. That mission eventually suffered deaths from malaria of a missionary, his wife, a second missionary&#x27;s wife, and three children. Livingstone had suffered over thirty attacks during his previous journey but had understated his suffering and overstated the quality of the land they would find, and the missionaries set out for the marshy region with wholly inadequate supplies of quinine. Biographer Tim Jeal considered this episode a major failing for Livingstone, and indicative of a pattern of putting his goals and career above the lives of those around him.

Livingstone was now a celebrity, in great demand as a public speaker, and was elected to the Royal Society. He gained public backing for his plans, and raised finances for his next expedition by public subscription, as well as £5,000 from the government to investigate the potential for British trade via the Zambezi.

===Zambezi expedition===
In December 1857 the Foreign Office proposed a huge expedition. Livingstone had envisaged another solo journey with African helpers, in January 1858 he agreed to lead a second Zambezi expedition with six specialist officers, hurriedly recruited in the UK.

The prefabricated iron river steamer &quot;Ma Robert&quot; was quickly built in portable sections, and loaded onto the Colonial Office steamer &quot;Pearl&quot;, which took them out on its way to Ceylon. They left on 10 March, at Freetown collected twelve Kru seafarers to man the river steamer, and reached the Zambezi on 14 May. The plan was for both ships to take them up the river to establish bases, but it turned out to be completely impassable to boats past the Cahora Bassa rapids, a series of cataracts and rapids that Livingstone had failed to explore on his earlier travels. &quot;Pearl&quot; offloaded their supplies on an island about upstream. From there, &quot;Ma Robert&quot; had to make repeated slow journeys, getting hauled across shoals. The riverbanks were a war zone, with Portuguese soldiers and their slaves fighting the Chikunda slave-hunters of Matakenya (Mariano), but both sides accepted the expedition as friends.
The experts, stuck at Shupanga, could not make the intended progress, and there were disagreements. Artist Thomas Baines was dismissed from the expedition. Others on the expedition became the first to reach Lake Nyasa and they explored it in a four-oared gig. In 1861 the Colonial Office provided a new wooden paddle survey vessel, &quot;Pioneer&quot;, which took the Universities&#x27; Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) led by Bishop Charles MacKenzie up the Shire river to found a new mission.

Livingstone raised funds for a replacement river steamer, &quot;Lady Nyasa&quot;, specially designed to sail on Lake Nyasa. It was shipped out in sections, contrary to his request, with a mission party including Mary Livingstone, and arrived in 1862. The &quot;Pioneer&quot; was delayed getting down to the coast to meet them, and there were further delays after it was found that the bishop had died. Mary Livingstone died on 27 April 1862 from malaria.

Livingstone took &quot;Pioneer&quot; up the coast and investigated the Ruvuma River, and the physician John Kirk wrote &quot;I can come to no other conclusion than that Dr Livingstone is out of his mind and a most unsafe leader&quot;.

When &quot;Pioneer&quot; returned to Shupanga in December 1862, they paid (in cloth) their &quot;Mazaro men&quot; who left and engaged replacements. On 10 January 1863 they set off, towing &quot;Lady Nyasa&quot;, and went up the Shire river past scenes of devastation as Mariano&#x27;s Chikunda slave-hunts caused famine, and they frequently had to clear the paddle wheels of corpses left floating downstream. They reached Chibisa&#x27;s and the Murchison Cataracts in April, then began dismantling &quot;Lady Nyasa&quot; and building a road to take its sections past the cataracts, while explorations continued.

He brought the ships downriver in 1864 after the government ordered the recall of the expedition. The Zambezi Expedition was castigated as a failure in many newspapers of the time, and Livingstone experienced great difficulty in raising funds to further explore Africa. John Kirk, Charles Meller, and Richard Thornton, scientists appointed to work under Livingstone, contributed large collections of botanical, ecological, geological, and ethnographic material to scientific Institutions in the United Kingdom.

===The Nile===
In January 1866, Livingstone returned to Africa, this time to Zanzibar, and from there he set out to seek the source of the Nile. Richard Francis Burton, John Hanning Speke, and Samuel Baker had identified either Lake Albert or Lake Victoria as the source (which was partially correct, as the Nile &quot;bubbles from the ground high in the mountains of Burundi halfway between Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria&quot;), but there was still serious debate on the matter. Livingstone believed that the source was farther south and assembled a team to find it consisting of freed slaves, Comoros Islanders, twelve Sepoys, and two servants from his previous expedition, Chuma and Susi. 
Livingstone set out from the mouth of the Ruvuma river, but his assistants gradually began deserting him. The Comoros Islanders had returned to Zanzibar and (falsely) informed authorities that Livingstone had died. He reached Lake Malawi on 6 August, by which time most of his supplies had been stolen, including all his medicines. Livingstone then travelled through swamps in the direction of Lake Tanganyika, with his health declining. He sent a message to Zanzibar requesting that supplies be sent to Ujiji and he then headed west, forced by ill health to travel with slave traders. He arrived at Lake Mweru on 8 November 1867 and continued on, travelling south to become the first European to see Lake Bangweulu. Upon finding the Lualaba River, Livingstone theorised that it could have been the high part of the Nile; but realised that it in fact flowed into the River Congo at Upper Congo Lake.

The year 1869 began with Livingstone finding himself extremely ill while in the jungle. He was saved by Arab traders who gave him medicines and carried him to an Arab outpost. In March 1869, Livingstone suffered from pneumonia and arrived in Ujiji to find his supplies stolen. He was coming down with cholera and had tropical ulcers on his feet, so he was again forced to rely on slave traders to get him as far as Bambara—where he was caught by the wet season. With no supplies, Livingstone had to eat his meals in a roped-off enclosure for the entertainment of the locals in return for food.

On 15 July 1871, Livingstone recorded in his field diary his immediate impressions as he witnessed around 400 Africans being massacred by Arab slavers at the Nyangwe market on the banks of the Lualaba River, while he was watching next to the leading Arab trader Dugumbe who had given him assistance.

The cause behind this attack is stated to be retaliation for actions of Manilla, the head slave who had sacked villages of Mohombo people at the instigation of the Wagenya chieftain Kimburu. The Arabs attacked the shoppers and Kimburu&#x27;s people.

Researchers from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania who scanned Livingstone&#x27;s diary suggest that in putting his fragmentary notes about the massacre into the narrative of his journal, he left out his concerns about some of his followers, slaves owned by Banyan merchants who had been hired by John Kirk, acting consul at Zanzibar, and sent to get Livingstone to safety. These slaves had been liberated and added to his party, but had shown violent conduct against local people contrary to his instructions, and he feared they might have been involved in starting the massacre. His diary noted &quot;Dugumbe&#x27;s men murdering Kimburu and another for slaves&quot; and implied that the slave Manilla played a leading part, but looking back at the events, he says Dugumbé&#x27;s people bore responsibility, and started it to make an example of Manilla. In the diary he described his sending his men with protection of a flag to assist Manilla&#x27;s brother. In his journal version it was to assist villagers. The version edited by Waller in the &quot;Last Journals&quot;, published in 1874, left out the context of Livingstone&#x27;s earlier comments about Kirk and bad behaviour of the hired Banyan men, and omitted the villagers&#x27; earlier violent resistance to Arab slavers, so it portrayed the villagers as passive victims. The section on the massacre itself had only minor grammatical corrections. Further research into diary notes continues.

The massacre horrified Livingstone, leaving him too shattered to continue his mission to find the source of the Nile. Following the end of the wet season, he travelled from Nyangwe back to Ujiji, an Arab settlement on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika—violently ill most of the way—arriving on 23 October 1871.

===Geographical discoveries===
Livingstone was wrong about the Nile, but he identified numerous geographical features for Western science, such as Lake Ngami, Lake Malawi, and Lake Bangweulu, in addition to Victoria Falls mentioned above. He filled in details of Lake Tanganyika, Lake Mweru, and the course of many rivers, especially the upper Zambezi, and his observations enabled large regions to be mapped which previously had been blank. Even so, the farthest north he reached was the north end of Lake Tanganyika—still south of the Equator—and he did not penetrate the rainforest of the River Congo any farther downstream than Ntangwe near Misisi.

Livingstone was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London and was made a Fellow of the society, with which he had a strong association for the rest of his life.

==Stanley meeting==

Livingstone completely lost contact with the outside world for six years and was ill for most of the last four years of his life. Only one of his 44 letter dispatches made it to Zanzibar. One surviving letter to Horace Waller was made available to the public in 2010 by its owner Peter Beard. It reads: &quot;I am terribly knocked up but this is for your own eye only... Doubtful if I live to see you again...&quot;

Henry Morton Stanley had been sent to find him by the &quot;New York Herald&quot; newspaper in 1869. He found Livingstone in the town of Ujiji on the shores of Lake Tanganyika on 10 November 1871, apparently greeting him with the now famous words &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I presume?&quot; Livingstone responded, &quot;Yes&quot;, and then, &quot;I feel thankful that I am here to welcome you.&quot; These famous words may have been a fabrication, as Stanley later tore out the pages of this encounter in his diary. Even Livingstone&#x27;s account of this encounter does not mention these words. However, the phrase appears in a &quot;New York Herald&quot; editorial dated 10 August 1872, and the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; both quote it without questioning its veracity. The words are famous because of their perceived humour, Livingstone being the only other white person for hundreds of miles, along with Stanley&#x27;s clumsy attempt at appearing dignified in the bush of Africa by making a formal greeting one might expect to hear in the confines of an upper-class London club. However, readers of the &quot;Herald&quot; immediately saw through Stanley&#x27;s pretensions. As noted by his biographer Tim Jeal, Stanley struggled his whole life with a self-perceived weakness of being from a humble background, and manufactured events to make up for this supposed deficiency. Stanley&#x27;s book suggests that this greeting was truly motivated by embarrassment, because he did not dare to embrace Livingstone.

Despite Stanley&#x27;s urgings, Livingstone was determined not to leave Africa until his mission was complete. His illness made him confused and he had judgment difficulties at the end of his life. He explored the Lualaba and, failing to find connections to the Nile, returned to Lake Bangweulu and its swamps to explore possible rivers flowing out northwards.

==Christianity and Sechele==
Livingstone is known as &quot;Africa&#x27;s greatest missionary&quot;, yet he is recorded as having converted only one African: Sechele, who was the chief of the Kwena people of Botswana (Kwena are one of the main Sotho-Tswana clans, found in South Africa, Lesotho, and Botswana in all three Sotho-Tswana language groupings). Sechele was born in 1812. His father died when Sechele was 10, and two of his uncles divided the tribe, which forced Sechele to leave his home for nine years. When Sechele returned, he took over one of his uncle&#x27;s tribes; at that point, he met Livingstone. Livingstone immediately became interested in Sechele, and especially his ability to read. Being a quick learner, Sechele learned the alphabet in two days and soon called English a second language. After teaching his wives the skill, he wrote the Bible in his native tongue.

Livingstone was known through a large part of Africa for treating the natives with respect, and the tribes that he visited returned his respect with faith and loyalty. He could never permanently convert the tribesmen to Christianity, however. Among other reasons, Sechele, by then the leader of the African tribe, did not like the way that Livingstone could not demand rain of his God like his rainmakers, who said that they could. After long hesitation from Livingstone, he baptised Sechele and had the church completely embrace him. Sechele was now a part of the church, but he continued to act according to his African culture, which went against Livingstone&#x27;s teachings.

Sechele was no different from any other man of his tribe in believing in polygamy. He had five wives, including MmaKgari (SeTswana for &quot;mother of Kgari&quot;), Mokgokong and Masebele When Livingstone told him to get rid of four of them, it shook the foundations of the Kwena tribe. After he finally divorced the women, Livingstone baptised them all and everything went well. However, one year later one of his ex-wives became pregnant and Sechele was the father. Sechele begged Livingstone not to give up on him because his faith was still strong, but Livingstone left the country and went north to continue his Christianizing attempts.

After Livingstone left the Kwena tribe, Sechele remained faithful to Christianity and led missionaries to surrounding tribes as well as converting nearly his entire Kwena people. In the estimation of Neil Parsons of the University of Botswana, Sechele &quot;did more to propagate Christianity in 19th-century southern Africa than virtually any single European missionary&quot;. Although Sechele was a self-proclaimed Christian, many European missionaries disagreed. The Kwena tribe leader kept rainmaking a part of his life as well as polygamy.

==Death==
Livingstone died on 1 May 1873 at the age of 60 in Chief Chitambo&#x27;s village at Chipundu, southeast of Lake Bangweulu, in present-day Zambia, from malaria and internal bleeding due to dysentery. Led by his loyal attendants Chuma and Susi, his expedition arranged funeral ceremonies. They removed his heart and buried it under a tree near the spot where he died, which has been identified variously as a mvula tree or a baobab tree but is more likely to be a mpundu tree, as baobabs are found at lower altitudes and in more arid regions. That site, now known as the Livingstone Memorial, lists his date of death as 4 May, the date reported (and carved into the tree&#x27;s trunk) by Chuma and Susi; but most sources consider 1 May—the date of Livingstone&#x27;s final journal entry—as the correct one.

The expedition led by Chuma and Susi then carried the rest of his remains, together with his last journal and belongings, on a journey that took 63 days to the coastal town of Bagamoyo, a distance exceeding . The caravan encountered the expedition of English explorer Verney Lovett Cameron, who continued his march and reached Ujiji in February 1874, where he found and sent to England Livingstone&#x27;s papers. Seventy-nine followers completed the journey, the men were paid their due wages, and Livingstone&#x27;s remains were returned by ship to Britain for burial. In London, his body lay in repose at No.1 Savile Row, then the headquarters of the Royal Geographical Society, prior to interment at Westminster Abbey.

==Livingstone and slavery==


While talking about the slave trade in East Africa in his journals:

Livingstone wrote about a group of slaves forced to march by Arab slave traders in the African Great Lakes region when he was travelling there in 1866:

He also described: 

Often cited is Livingstone&#x27;s estimate of the number of slaves that made it to market versus those who died because of the slave trade:

Livingstone&#x27;s letters, books, and journals did stir up public support for the abolition of slavery; however, he became dependent for assistance on the very slave-traders whom he wished to put out of business. He was a poor leader of his peers, and he ended up on his last expedition as an individualist explorer with servants and porters but no expert support around him. At the same time, he did not use the brutal methods of maverick explorers such as Stanley to keep his retinue of porters in line and his supplies secure. For these reasons, he accepted help and hospitality from 1867 onwards from Mohamad Bogharib and Mohamad bin Saleh (also known as &quot;Mpamari&quot;), traders who kept and traded in slaves, as he recounts in his journals. They, in turn, benefited from Livingstone&#x27;s influence with local people, which facilitated Mpamari&#x27;s release from bondage to Mwata Kazembe. Livingstone was furious to discover that some of the replacement porters sent at his request from Ujiji were slaves.

Livingstone&#x27;s figures on slaves have however been criticised as highly exaggerated.
==Legacy==
By the late 1860s Livingstone&#x27;s reputation in Europe had suffered owing to the failure of the missions he set up, and of the Zambezi Expedition; and his ideas about the source of the Nile were not supported. His expeditions were hardly models of order and organisation. His reputation was rehabilitated by Stanley and his newspaper, and by the loyalty of Livingstone&#x27;s servants whose long journey with his body inspired wonder. The publication of his last journal revealed stubborn determination in the face of suffering.

In 1860, the Universities&#x27; Mission to Central Africa was founded at his request. Many important missionaries, such as Leader Stirling and Miss Annie Allen, would later work for this group. This group and the medical missionaries it sponsored came to have major, positive impact on the people of Africa.

Livingstone made geographical discoveries for European knowledge. He inspired abolitionists of the slave trade, explorers, and missionaries. He opened up Central Africa to missionaries who initiated the education and healthcare for Africans, and trade by the African Lakes Company. He was held in some esteem by many African chiefs and local people and his name facilitated relations between them and the British.
Partly as a result, within 50 years of his death, colonial rule was established in Africa, and white settlement was encouraged to extend further into the interior. However, what Livingstone envisaged for &quot;colonies&quot; was not what we now know as colonial rule, but rather settlements of dedicated Christian Europeans who would live among the people to help them work out ways of living that did not involve slavery. Livingstone was part of an evangelical and nonconformist movement in Britain which during the 19th century helped change the national mindset from the notion of a divine right to rule &#x27;lesser races&#x27;, to more modernly ethical ideas in foreign policy.

The David Livingstone Centre in Blantyre celebrates his life and is based in the house in which he was born, on the site of the mill in which he started his working life. His Christian faith is evident in his journal, in which one entry reads: &quot;I place no value on anything I have or may possess, except in relation to the kingdom of Christ. If anything will advance the interests of the kingdom, it shall be given away or kept, only as by giving or keeping it I shall promote the glory of Him to whom I owe all my hopes in time and eternity.&quot;

According to Alvyn Austin in 1997:
During the anti-colonial 1960s, Livingstone was debunked: he made only one certified convert, who later backslid; he explored few areas not already traveled by others; he freed few slaves; he treated his colleagues horribly; he traveled with Arab slave traders; his family life was in shambles—in short, to many he embodied the &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; mentality. Nonetheless, at a time when countries are being renamed and statues are being toppled, Livingstone has not fallen. Despite modern Africans&#x27; animosity toward other Europeans, such as Cecil Rhodes, Livingstone endures as a heroic legend. Rhodesia has long since purged its name, but the cities of Livingstone (Zambia) and Livingstonia (Malawi) keep the explorer&#x27;s appellation with pride.

In 2002, David Livingstone was named among the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.

==Family life==

While Livingstone had a great impact on the expansion of the British Empire, he did so at a tremendous cost to his family. In his absences, his children grew up missing their father, and his wife Mary (daughter of Mary and Robert Moffat), whom he married in 1845, endured very poor health, and died of malaria on 27 April 1862.

He had six children:

# Robert died while serving in the Union Army during the American Civil War; He took the name Rupert Vincent and was the substitute for Horace Heath, and took his place in Company H of the 3rd New Hampshire Volunteers. Robert ended up being captured by the Confederate States Army and died at the Salisbury prison camp in Rowan County, North Carolina, which has since been termed, &quot;North Carolina&#x27;s Andersonville.&quot;
# Agnes (born 1847 or 1857, died 1912; married A.L. Bruce, a wealthy Scottish brewery executive.)
# Thomas, died in Egypt in 1876 at the age of 27 from bilharzia, a disease he contracted as a child living in Africa.
# Elizabeth (who died at two months)
# William Oswell (nicknamed Zouga because of the river along which he was born, in 1851; died in 1892 in Trinidad where he practiced medicine.)
# Anna Mary (born 1858, died 1939)

Only Agnes, William Oswell and Anna Mary married and had children. His one regret in later life was that he did not spend enough time with his children.

==Portrayal in film and books==
* Livingstone has been portrayed by M. A. Wetherell in &quot;Livingstone&quot; (1925), Percy Marmont in &quot;David Livingstone&quot; (1936), Sir Cedric Hardwicke in &quot;Stanley and Livingstone&quot; (1939), Michael Gough in BBC television series &quot;The Search for the Nile&quot; (1971), Bernard Hill in &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot; (1990) and Sir Nigel Hawthorne in the TV movie &quot;Forbidden Territory&quot; (1997).
* Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;The Young Allies&quot; #2 featured an explorer named &quot;Martin Livingstone&quot; who discovered a new territory he dubbed &quot;New America&quot; and claimed it for the United States. Bucky Barnes greets him with the famous, &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I presume?&quot; The story was at least partially drawn by Ernie Hart, but the writer is unknown—Otto Binder had written the preceding issue and Stan Lee the following one.
* The 1949 comedy film &quot;Africa Screams&quot; is the story of a dimwitted clerk named Stanley Livington (played by Lou Costello), who is mistaken for a famous African explorer and recruited to lead a treasure hunt. The character&#x27;s name appears to be a play on Stanley and Livingstone.
* Stanley Livingston, played by Mort Marshall, whose name invokes both Stanley and David Livingtone, was the zoo director on &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales&quot;, a 1963-66 animated series.
* &quot;Out of Darkness, Shining Light&quot; (2019) by Petina Gappah is a fictionalized account of how Livingstone&#x27;s body, papers, and maps traveled 1,500 miles across the continent of Africa, so his remains could be returned to England and his work preserved there.

==In popular culture==
In the 1940 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon &quot;Africa Squeaks&quot;, a caricature of Spencer Tracy as Henry Morton Stanley erroneously presumes Porky Pig to be Livingstone in the heart of &quot;Darkest Africa&quot;.

The Moody Blues 1968 single &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I Presume&quot; paints the adventures of Livingstone, Captain Scott, and Columbus with the refrain &quot;What did you find there? Did you stand awhile and stare? Did you meet anyone?&quot;, followed by a repeated chorus of &quot;We&#x27;re all looking for someone&quot;.

The ABBA song &quot;What about Livingstone?&quot; mentions Livingstone &quot;traveling up the Nile&quot;. Livingstone made 4 great journeys into Africa, three of them starting in Cape Town, South Africa and the last at Zanzibar. None of the routes traveled on the Nile which lay far to the north. He may have crossed sections of the headwaters of Nile on his final expedition but he would not have known so as these areas were not considered in the Nile watershed until much later.

A song from American heavy metal band Alcatrazz called Jet to Jet from 1983&#x27;s No Parole from Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll contains the lyrics &quot;Dr. Livingstone where are you, when We need you the most&quot; which is in reference to the famed doctor and his expedition to Africa.

Stanley&#x27;s search for and discovery of Livingstone is the subject of the Hugh Masekela song &quot;Witch Doctor&quot; that appears on his 1976 album, &quot;Colonial Man&quot;.

&quot;Civilization V: Brave New World&quot; includes an achievement called &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I presume?&quot; The achievement requires playing as Belgium, moving H. M. Stanley within a space of Dr. Livingstone.

<doc id="53530" wikidata="Q2376488" url="?curid=53530" title="Gruyère cheese">
<text>Gruyère (, , ; , ) is a hard Swiss cheese that originated in the cantons of Fribourg, Vaud, Neuchâtel, Jura, and Berne in Switzerland. It is named after the town of Gruyères in Fribourg. In 2001, Gruyère gained the (AOC), which became the (AOP) as of 2013.

Gruyère is classified as a Swiss-type or Alpine cheese and is sweet but slightly salty, with a flavour that varies widely with age. It is often described as creamy and nutty when young, becoming more assertive, earthy, and complex as it matures. When fully aged (five months to a year), it tends to have small cracks that impart a slightly grainy texture. Unlike Emmental, with which it is often confused, modern Gruyère has few if any eyes, although in the 19th century, this was not always the case. The small cracks that can develop in Gruyère cheese are often referred to as &quot;eyes&quot;. These eyes are round or irregularly shaped holes that are formed during the aging process. It is the most popular Swiss cheese in Switzerland and in most of Europe.

==Uses==
Gruyère is used in many ways in countless dishes. It is considered a good cheese for baking, because of its distinctive but not overpowering taste. For example in quiche, Gruyère adds savoriness without overshadowing the other ingredients. It is a good melting cheese, particularly suited for fondues, along with Vacherin Fribourgeois and Emmental. It is also traditionally used in French onion soup, as well as in croque-monsieur, a classic French toasted ham and cheese sandwich. Gruyère is also used in chicken and veal cordon bleu. It is a fine table cheese, and when grated, it is often used with salads and pastas. It is used, grated, atop le tourin, a garlic soup from France served on dried bread. White wines, such as Riesling, pair well with Gruyère. Sparkling cider and Bock beer are also beverage affinities.

==Production==

To make Gruyère, raw cow&#x27;s milk is heated to in a copper vat, and then curdled by the addition of liquid rennet. The curd is cut up into pea-sized pieces and stirred, releasing whey. The curd is cooked at , and raised quickly to .

The whey is strained, and the curds placed into moulds to be pressed. After salting in brine and smearing with bacteria, the cheese is ripened for two months at room temperature, generally on wooden boards, turning every couple of days to ensure even moisture distribution. Gruyère can be cured for 3 to 10 months, with long curing producing a cheese of intense flavour.

Sérac, a whey cheese, is a historical by-product of the manufacture of Gruyère.

===Affinage===
An important and the longest part of the production of Gruyère in Switzerland is the &quot;affinage&quot; (French for &#x27;maturation&#x27;).

According to the AOC, the cellars to mature a Swiss Gruyère must have a climate close to a natural cave. This means that the humidity should be between 94% and 98%. If the humidity is lower, the cheese dries out. If the humidity is too high, the cheese does not mature and becomes smeary and gluey. The temperature of the caves should be between . This relatively high temperature is required for excellent-quality cheese. Lower-quality cheeses result from temperatures between . The lower the temperature, the less the cheese matures, resulting in a harder and more crumbly texture.

== Legal protection ==

===Switzerland===
In 2001, Gruyère gained the Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée (now designated Appellation d&#x27;origine protégée) status. Since then, the production and the maturation have been strictly defined, and all Swiss Gruyère producers must follow these rules.

===France===
Although Gruyère is recognised as a Swiss Geographical Indication in the EU, Gruyère of French origin is also protected as a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) in the EU. To avoid confusion, the EU PGI Gruyère must indicate that it comes from France and must make sure it cannot be confused with Gruyère from Switzerland. It, therefore, is generally sold as &quot;French Gruyère&quot;.

French Gruyère may be produced in an area much larger than the Swiss AOP area. The PGI documentation also requires that French Gruyère has holes &quot;ranging in size from that of a pea to a cherry&quot;, a significant departure from the Swiss original. Peter Ungphakorn, a Swiss local and an international trade expert, comments that the French Comté cheese could be a closer match to the Swiss version.

=== United States ===
In 2021, a U.S. District Court ruled that the term &quot;gruyere&quot; had become a generic term for a certain type of cheese, and Swiss and French Gruyère producers&#x27; associations could not register it as a trademark in the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed that decision in March 2023.

Swiss Gruyère still has a protected certification mark in the US as &quot;Le Gruyère Switzerland AOC&quot;, secured in 2013.

The FDA standards of identity for a &quot;§ 133.149 Gruyere cheese&quot; requires &quot;small holes or eyes&quot;.

==Varieties==
Gruyere (as a Swiss AOC) has many varieties with different age profiles, and an organic version of the cheese is also sold. A special variety is produced only in summer in the Swiss Alps and is branded as Le Gruyère Switzerland AOC Alpage.

Generally, one can distinguish the age profiles of mild/&quot;doux&quot; (minimum five months old) and &quot;réserve&quot;, also known as &quot;surchoix&quot; (minimum ten months old). In Switzerland, other age profiles can be found, including &quot;mi-salé&quot; (7–8 months), &quot;salé&quot; (9–10 months), &quot;vieux&quot; (14 months), and Höhlengereift (cave aged), but these age profiles are not part of the AOC.

===Le Gruyère AOP Premier Cru===
Le Gruyère Premier Cru is a special variety, produced and matured exclusively in the canton of Fribourg and matured for 14 months in cellars with a humidity of 95% and a temperature of .

It is the only cheese that has won the title of the best cheese in the world at the World Cheese Awards five times: in 1992, 2002, 2005, 2015, and 2022.

==Similar cheeses==
L&#x27;Etivaz is a very similar Swiss hard cheese from the canton of Vaud. It is made from raw cow&#x27;s milk and is very similar to aged Gruyère in taste. In the 1930s, a group of 76 Gruyère producing families felt that government regulations were allowing cheesemakers to compromise the qualities that made good Gruyère so special. They withdrew from the government&#x27;s Gruyère program, and &quot;created&quot; their own cheese - L&#x27;Etivaz - named for the village around which they all lived. They founded a cooperative in 1932, and the first cheese cellars were built in 1934.

The French Le Brouère cheese, made in nearby Vosges, is considered a variant of Gruyère.

Γραβιέρα (&quot;graviera&quot;) is a popular Greek cheese which resembles Gruyère and is an EU Protected Designation of Origin. There are Naxian varieties (produced from cow&#x27;s milk) that tend to be milder and sweeter, and various &quot;gravieras&quot; from Crete, which are produced from sheep&#x27;s milk.

Kars gravyer cheese is a Turkish cheese made of cow&#x27;s milk or a mixture of cow&#x27;s and goat&#x27;s milk. Gruyère-style cheeses are also produced in the United States, with Wisconsin having the largest output, and in Bosnia under the name &quot;Livanjski sir&quot; (Livno cheese).

<text>Dorset Blue Vinney (frequently spelled &quot;vinny&quot;) is a traditional blue cheese made near Sturminster Newton in Dorset, England, from cows&#x27; milk. It is a hard, crumbly cheese. It was formerly made of skimmed milk.

&quot;Vinney&quot; may be the Dorset form of the archaic word &quot;vinny&quot; (&quot;moldy&quot;) or perhaps a corruption of &quot;veiny&quot;, referring to its blue veins.

Blue Vinney is often made from unpasteurised milk. This is considered healthy by some and risky by others due to the potential for tuberculosis from infected cows passing into the milk. It has a strong taste and smell. The cheese is said to go well with Dorset knobs, another traditional product from Dorset.

Dorset Blue Cheese has been awarded Protected Geographical Status, ensuring only cheese originating from Dorset may use the name.

==History==
Historically cheese in Dorset was merely a by-product of the much more lucrative butter market. Milk was of little value before the railways as it could not be brought to market before it went off, thus cheese and butter production was the main focus of dairy farms. Dorset butter was highly regarded in London where it fetched a premium price but making butter left the farmers with large quantities of skimmed milk which they turned into a hard, crumbly cheese.

Local myth describes how in years gone by, due to its supposed illegal nature, Blue Vinny would be left on the doorstep of those who ordered it on the black market.

While the cheese was a common farmhouse cheese in Dorset for hundreds of years, production nearly dried up after the Second World War, and was made in very small quantities on just a few farms. However, in the 1980s Woodbridge Farm in Dorset revived the old recipe, and it is now producing the cheese again, but with whole milk.

==In popular culture==
In his poem &quot;Praise O&#x27; Do&#x27;set&quot;, the Dorset poet William Barnes asks,

:Woont ye have brown bread a-put ye,
:An&#x27; some vinny cheese a-cut ye?

<doc id="53536" wikidata="Q7346" url="?curid=53536" title="John Coltrane">
<text>John William Coltrane (September 23, 1926 – July 17, 1967) was an American jazz saxophonist, bandleader and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music.

Born and raised in North Carolina, after graduating from high school Coltrane moved to Philadelphia, where he studied music. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes and was one of the players at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. Over the course of his career, Coltrane&#x27;s music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension, as exemplified on his most acclaimed album &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; (1965) and others. Decades after his death, Coltrane remains influential, and he has received numerous posthumous awards, including a special Pulitzer Prize, and was canonized by the African Orthodox Church.

His second wife was pianist and harpist Alice Coltrane. The couple had three children: John Jr. (1964–1982), a bassist; Ravi (born 1965), a saxophonist; and Oran (born 1967), a saxophonist, guitarist, drummer and singer.

==Biography==

=== 1926–1945: Early life ===
Coltrane was born in his parents&#x27; apartment at 200 Hamlet Avenue in Hamlet, North Carolina, on September 23, 1926. His father was John R. Coltrane and his mother was Alice Blair. He grew up in High Point, North Carolina, and attended William Penn High School. While in high school, Coltrane played clarinet and alto horn in a community band before switching to the saxophone, after being influenced by the likes of Lester Young and Johnny Hodges. Beginning in December 1938, his father, aunt, and grandparents died within a few months of one another, leaving him to be raised by his mother and a close cousin. In June 1943, shortly after graduating from high school, Coltrane and his family moved to Philadelphia, where he got a job at a sugar refinery. In September that year, his 17th birthday, his mother bought him his first saxophone, an alto. From 1944 to 1945, Coltrane took saxophone lessons at the Ornstein School of Music with Mike Guerra. Between early to mid-1945, he had his first professional work as a musician: a &quot;cocktail lounge trio&quot; with piano and guitar.

An important moment in the progression of Coltrane&#x27;s musical development occurred on June 5, 1945, when he saw Charlie Parker perform for the first time. In a &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine article in 1960 he recalled: &quot;the first time I heard Bird play, it hit me right between the eyes.&quot;

=== 1945–1946: Military service ===
To avoid being drafted by the Army, Coltrane enlisted in the Navy on August 6, 1945, the day the first U.S. atomic bomb was dropped on Japan. He was trained as an apprentice seaman at Sampson Naval Training Station in upstate New York before he was shipped to Pearl Harbor, where he was stationed at Manana Barracks, the largest posting of African American servicemen in the world. By the time he got to Hawaii in late 1945, the Navy was downsizing. Coltrane&#x27;s musical talent was recognized and, when he joined the Melody Masters, the base swing band, he became one of the few Navy men to serve as a musician without having been granted musician&#x27;s rating. Because the Melody Masters was an all-white band, Coltrane was treated as a guest performer to avoid alerting superior officers of his participation in the band. He continued to perform other duties when not playing with the band, including kitchen and security details. By the end of his service, he had assumed a leadership role in the band. His first recordings, an informal session in Hawaii with Navy musicians, occurred on July 13, 1946. He played alto saxophone on a selection of jazz standards and bebop tunes. He was officially discharged from the Navy on August 8, 1946. He was awarded the American Campaign Medal, Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.

=== 1946–1954: Immediate post-war career ===
After being discharged from the Navy as a seaman first class in August 1946, Coltrane returned to Philadelphia, where the city&#x27;s bustling jazz scene offered him many opportunities for both learning and playing. Coltrane used the G.I. Bill to enroll at the Granoff School of Music, where he studied music theory with jazz guitarist and composer Dennis Sandole. Coltrane would continue to be under Sandole&#x27;s tutelage from 1946 into the early 1950s. Coltrane additionally took saxophone lessons with Matthew Rastelli, a saxophone teacher at Granoff, once a week for about two or three years, but the lessons stopped when Coltrane&#x27;s G.I. Bill funds ran out. After touring with King Kolax, he joined a band led by Jimmy Heath, who was introduced to Coltrane&#x27;s playing by his former Navy buddy, trumpeter William Massey, who had played with Coltrane in the Melody Masters. Although he started on alto saxophone, he began playing tenor saxophone in 1947 with Eddie Vinson.

Coltrane called this a time when &quot;a wider area of listening opened up for me. There were many things that people like Hawk [Coleman Hawkins], and Ben [Webster] and Tab Smith were doing in the &#x27;40s that I didn&#x27;t understand, but that I felt emotionally.&quot; A significant influence, according to tenor saxophonist Odean Pope, was the Philadelphia pianist, composer, and theorist Hasaan Ibn Ali. &quot;Hasaan was the clue to...the system that Trane uses. Hasaan was the great influence on Trane&#x27;s melodic concept.&quot; Coltrane became fanatical about practicing and developing his craft, practicing &quot;25 hours a day&quot; according to Jimmy Heath. Heath recalls an incident in a hotel in San Francisco when after a complaint was issued, Coltrane took the horn out of his mouth and practiced fingering for a full hour. Such was his dedication; it was common for him to fall asleep with the horn still in his mouth or practice a single note for hours on end.

Charlie Parker, who Coltrane had first heard perform before his time in the Navy, became an idol, and he and Coltrane would play together occasionally in the late 1940s. He was a member of groups led by Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, and Johnny Hodges in the early to mid-1950s.

===1955–1957: Miles and Monk period===
In 1955, Coltrane was freelancing in Philadelphia while studying with Sandole when he received a call from trumpeter Miles Davis. Davis had been successful in the 1940s, but his reputation and work had been damaged in part by heroin addiction; he was again active and about to form a quintet. Coltrane was with this edition of the Davis band (known as the &quot;First Great Quintet&quot;—along with Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums) from October 1955 to April 1957 (with a few absences). During this period Davis released several influential recordings that revealed the first signs of Coltrane&#x27;s growing ability. This quintet, represented by two marathon recording sessions for Prestige in 1956, resulted in the albums &quot;Cookin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Relaxin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Workin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Steamin&#x27;&quot;. The &quot;First Great Quintet&quot; disbanded due in part to Coltrane&#x27;s heroin addiction.

During the later part of 1957, Coltrane worked with Thelonious Monk at New York&#x27;s Five Spot Café, and played in Monk&#x27;s quartet (July–December 1957), but, owing to contractual conflicts, took part in only one official studio recording session with this group. Coltrane recorded many sessions for Prestige under his own name at this time, but Monk refused to record for his old label. A private recording made by Juanita Naima Coltrane of a 1958 reunion of the group was issued by Blue Note Records as &quot;Live at the Five Spot—Discovery!&quot; in 1993. A high quality tape of a concert given by this quartet in November 1957 was found later, and was released by Blue Note in 2005. Recorded by Voice of America, the performances confirm the group&#x27;s reputation, and the resulting album, &quot;Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall&quot;, is very highly rated.

&quot;Blue Train&quot;, Coltrane&#x27;s sole date as leader for Blue Note, featuring trumpeter Lee Morgan, bassist Paul Chambers, and trombonist Curtis Fuller, is often considered his best album from this period. Four of its five tracks are original Coltrane compositions, and the title track, &quot;Moment&#x27;s Notice&quot;, and &quot;Lazy Bird&quot;, have become standards.

===1958: Davis and Coltrane===
Coltrane rejoined Davis in December 1957 after quitting his heroin addiction. In October of that year, jazz critic Ira Gitler coined the term &quot;sheets of sound&quot; to describe the style Coltrane developed with Monk and was perfecting in Davis&#x27;s group, now a sextet. His playing was compressed, with rapid runs cascading in very many notes per minute. Coltrane recalled: &quot;I found that there were a certain number of chord progressions to play in a given time, and sometimes what I played didn&#x27;t work out in eighth notes, sixteenth notes, or triplets. I had to put the notes in uneven groups like fives and sevens in order to get them all in.&quot;

Coltrane stayed with Davis until April 1960, working with alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley; pianists Red Garland, Bill Evans, and Wynton Kelly; bassist Paul Chambers; and drummers Philly Joe Jones and Jimmy Cobb. During this time he participated in the Davis sessions &quot;Milestones&quot; and &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, and the concert recordings &quot;Miles &amp; Monk at Newport&quot; (1963) and &quot;Jazz at the Plaza (1958)&quot;.

===1959–1961: Period with Atlantic Records===
At the end of this period, Coltrane recorded &quot;Giant Steps&quot; (1960), his first released album as leader for Atlantic that contained only his compositions. The album&#x27;s title track is generally considered to have one of the most difficult chord progressions of any widely played jazz composition, eventually referred to as Coltrane changes. His development of these cycles led to further experimentation with improvised melody and harmony that he continued throughout his career.
Coltrane formed his first quartet for live performances in 1960 for an appearance at the Jazz Gallery in New York City. After moving through different personnel, including Steve Kuhn, Pete La Roca, and Billy Higgins, he kept pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Steve Davis, and drummer Elvin Jones. Tyner, a native of Philadelphia, had been a friend of Coltrane for some years, and the two men had an understanding that Tyner would join the band when he felt ready. &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; (1961) was the first album recorded by this band. It was Coltrane&#x27;s first album on soprano saxophone, which he began practicing while with Miles Davis. It was considered an unconventional move because the instrument was more associated with earlier jazz.

===1961–1962: First years with Impulse! Records===
In May 1961, Coltrane&#x27;s contract with Atlantic was bought by Impulse!. The move to Impulse! meant that Coltrane resumed his recording relationship with engineer Rudy Van Gelder, who had recorded his and Davis&#x27;s sessions for Prestige. He recorded most of his albums for Impulse! at Van Gelder&#x27;s studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.

By early 1961, bassist Davis had been replaced by Reggie Workman, while Eric Dolphy joined the group as a second horn. The quintet had a celebrated and extensively recorded residency at the Village Vanguard, which demonstrated Coltrane&#x27;s new direction. It included the most experimental music he had played, influenced by Indian ragas, modal jazz, and free jazz. John Gilmore, a longtime saxophonist with musician Sun Ra, was particularly influential; after hearing a Gilmore performance, Coltrane is reported to have said, &quot;He&#x27;s got it! Gilmore&#x27;s got the concept!&quot; The most celebrated of the Vanguard tunes, the 15-minute blues &quot;Chasin&#x27; the &#x27;Trane&quot;, was strongly inspired by Gilmore&#x27;s music.

In 1961, Coltrane began pairing Workman with a second bassist, usually Art Davis or Donald Garrett. Garrett recalled playing a tape for Coltrane where &quot;I was playing with another bass player. We were doing some things rhythmically, and Coltrane became excited about the sound. We got the same kind of sound you get from the East Indian water drum. One bass remains in the lower register and is the stabilizing, pulsating thing, while the other bass is free to improvise, like the right hand would be on the drum. So Coltrane liked the idea.&quot; Coltrane also recalled: &quot;I thought another bass would add that certain rhythmic sound. We were playing a lot of stuff with a sort of suspended rhythm, with one bass playing a series of notes around one point, and it seemed that another bass could fill in the spaces.&quot; According to Eric Dolphy, one night: &quot;Wilbur Ware came in and up on the stand so they had three basses going. John and I got off the stand and listened.&quot; Coltrane employed two basses on the 1961 albums &quot;Olé Coltrane&quot; and &quot;Africa/Brass&quot;, and later on &quot;The John Coltrane Quartet Plays&quot; and &quot;Ascension&quot;. Both Reggie Workman and Jimmy Garrison play bass on the 1961 Village Vanguard recordings of &quot;India&quot; and &quot;Miles&#x27; Mode&quot;. 
During this period, critics were divided in their estimation of Coltrane, who had radically altered his style. Audiences, too, were perplexed; in France he was booed during his final tour with Davis. In 1961, &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine called Coltrane and Dolphy players of &quot;anti-jazz&quot; in an article that bewildered and upset the musicians. Coltrane admitted some of his early solos were based mostly on technical ideas. Furthermore, Dolphy&#x27;s angular, voice-like playing earned him a reputation as a figurehead of the New Thing, also known as free jazz, a movement led by Ornette Coleman that was denigrated by some jazz musicians (including Davis) and critics. But as Coltrane&#x27;s style developed, he was determined to make every performance &quot;a whole expression of one&#x27;s being&quot;.

===1962–1965: Classic Quartet period===

In 1962, Dolphy departed and Jimmy Garrison replaced Workman as bassist. From then on, the &quot;Classic Quartet&quot;, as it came to be known, with Tyner, Garrison, and Jones, produced searching, spiritually driven work. Coltrane was moving toward a more harmonically static style that allowed him to expand his improvisations rhythmically, melodically, and motivically. Harmonically complex music was still present, but on stage Coltrane heavily favored continually reworking his &quot;standards&quot;: &quot;Impressions&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, and &quot;I Want to Talk About You&quot;.

The criticism of the quintet with Dolphy may have affected Coltrane. In contrast to the radicalism of his 1961 recordings at the Village Vanguard, his studio albums in the following two years (with the exception of &quot;Coltrane&quot;, 1962, which featured a blistering version of Harold Arlen&#x27;s &quot;Out of This World&quot;) were much more conservative. He recorded an album of ballads and participated in album collaborations with Duke Ellington and singer Johnny Hartman, a baritone who specialized in ballads. The album &quot;Ballads&quot; (recorded 1961–62) is emblematic of Coltrane&#x27;s versatility, as the quartet shed new light on standards such as &quot;It&#x27;s Easy to Remember&quot;. Despite a more polished approach in the studio, in concert the quartet continued to balance &quot;standards&quot; and its own more exploratory and challenging music, as can be heard on the albums &quot;Impressions&quot; (recorded 1961–63), &quot;Live at Birdland&quot; and &quot;Newport &#x27;63&quot; (both recorded 1963). &quot;Impressions&quot; consists of two extended jams including the title track along with &quot;Dear Old Stockholm&quot;, &quot;After the Rain&quot; and a blues. Coltrane later said he enjoyed having a &quot;balanced catalogue&quot;.

On March 6, 1963, the group entered Van Gelder Studio in New Jersey and recorded a session that was lost for decades after its master tape was destroyed by Impulse! Records to cut down on storage space. On June 29, 2018, Impulse! released &quot;Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album&quot;, made up of seven tracks made from a spare copy Coltrane had given to his wife. On March 7, 1963, they were joined in the studio by Hartman for the recording of six tracks for the &quot;John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman&quot; album, released that July.

Impulse! followed the successful &quot;lost album&quot; release with 2019&#x27;s &quot;Blue World&quot;, made up of a 1964 soundtrack to the film &quot;The Cat in the Bag&quot;, recorded in June 1964.

The Classic Quartet produced its best-selling album, &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, in December 1964. A culmination of much of Coltrane&#x27;s work up to this point, this four-part suite is an ode to his faith in and love for God. These spiritual concerns characterized much of Coltrane&#x27;s composing and playing from this point onward—as can be seen from album titles such as &quot;Ascension&quot;, &quot;Om&quot; and &quot;Meditations&quot;. The fourth movement of &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, &quot;Psalm&quot;, is, in fact, a musical setting for an original poem to God written by Coltrane, and printed in the album&#x27;s liner notes. Coltrane plays almost exactly one note for each syllable of the poem, and bases his phrasing on the words. The album was composed at Coltrane&#x27;s home in Dix Hills on Long Island.

The quartet played &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; live only three times, recorded twice – in July 1965 at a concert in Antibes, France, and in October 1965 in Seattle, Washington. A recording of the Antibes concert was released by Impulse! in 2002 on the remastered Deluxe Edition of &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, and again in 2015 on the &quot;Super Deluxe Edition&quot; of The Complete Masters. A recently discovered second amateur recording titled &quot;A Love Supreme: Live in Seattle&quot; was released in 2021.

===1965: Adding to the quartet and avant-garde jazz===

In his late period, Coltrane showed an interest in the avant-garde jazz of Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Sun Ra. He was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler&#x27;s trio with bassist Gary Peacock, who had worked with Paul Bley, and drummer Sunny Murray, whose playing was honed with Cecil Taylor as leader. Coltrane championed many young free jazz musicians such as Archie Shepp, and, under his influence, Impulse! became a leading free jazz label.

After &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; was recorded, Ayler&#x27;s style became more prominent in Coltrane&#x27;s music. A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane&#x27;s playing becoming abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like multiphonics, use of overtones, and playing in the altissimo register, as well as a mutated return of Coltrane&#x27;s sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned soprano saxophone to concentrate on tenor. The quartet responded by playing with increasing freedom. The group&#x27;s evolution can be traced through the albums &quot;The John Coltrane Quartet Plays&quot;, &quot;Living Space&quot;, &quot;Transition&quot;, &quot;New Thing at Newport&quot;, &quot;Sun Ship&quot;, and &quot;First Meditations&quot;.

In June 1965, he went into Van Gelder&#x27;s studio with ten other musicians (including Shepp, Pharoah Sanders, Freddie Hubbard, Marion Brown, and John Tchicai) to record &quot;Ascension&quot;, a 38-minute piece that included solos by young avant-garde musicians. The album was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Sanders to join the band in September 1965. While Coltrane frequently used overblowing as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders &quot;was involved in the search for &#x27;human&#x27; sounds on his instrument,&quot; and drastically expanding the vocabulary of his horn by employing multiphonics, growling, and &quot;high register squeals [that] could imitate not only the human song but the human cry and shriek as well.&quot; Regarding Coltrane&#x27;s decision to add Sanders to the band, Gary Giddins wrote &quot;Those who had followed Coltrane to the edge of the galaxy now had the added challenge of a player who appeared to have little contact with earth.&quot;

===1965–1967: The second quartet===
By late 1965, Coltrane was regularly augmenting his group with Sanders and other free jazz musicians. Rashied Ali joined the group as a second drummer. This was the end of the quartet. Claiming he was unable to hear himself over the two drummers, Tyner left the band shortly after the recording of &quot;Meditations&quot;. Jones left in early 1966, dissatisfied by sharing drumming duties with Ali and stating that, concerning Coltrane&#x27;s latest music, &quot;only poets can understand it&quot;. In interviews, Tyner and Jones both voiced their displeasure with the music&#x27;s direction; however, they would incorporate some of the intensity of free jazz in their solo work. Later, both musicians expressed tremendous respect for Coltrane: regarding his late music, Jones stated: &quot;Well, of course it&#x27;s far out, because this is a tremendous mind that&#x27;s involved, you know. You wouldn&#x27;t expect Einstein to be playing jacks, would you?&quot; Tyner recalled: &quot;He was constantly pushing forward. He never rested on his laurels, he was always looking for what&#x27;s next... he was always searching, like a scientist in a lab, looking for something new, a different direction... He kept hearing these sounds in his head...&quot; Jones and Tyner both recorded tributes to Coltrane, Tyner with &quot;Echoes of a Friend&quot; (1972) and &quot;Blues for Coltrane: A Tribute to John Coltrane&quot; (1987), and Jones with &quot;Live in Japan 1978: Dear John C.&quot; (1978) and &quot;Tribute to John Coltrane &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;&quot; (1994).

There is speculation that in 1965 Coltrane began using LSD, informing the &quot;cosmic&quot; transcendence of his late period. Nat Hentoff wrote: &quot;it is as if he and Sanders were speaking with &#x27;the gift of tongues&#x27; – as if their insights were of such compelling force that they have to transcend ordinary ways of musical speech and ordinary textures to be able to convey that part of the essence of being they have touched.&quot; After the departure of Tyner and Jones, Coltrane led a quintet with Sanders on tenor saxophone, his second wife Alice Coltrane on piano, Garrison on bass, and Ali on drums. When touring, the group was known for playing long versions of their repertoire, many stretching beyond 30 minutes to an hour. In concert, solos by band members often extended beyond fifteen minutes.

The group can be heard on several concert recordings from 1966, including &quot;Live at the Village Vanguard Again!&quot; and &quot;Live in Japan&quot;. In 1967, Coltrane entered the studio several times. Although pieces with Sanders have surfaced (the unusual &quot;To Be&quot; has both men on flute), most of the recordings were either with the quartet minus Sanders (&quot;Expression&quot; and &quot;Stellar Regions&quot;) or as a duo with Ali. The latter duo produced six performances that appear on the album &quot;Interstellar Space&quot;. Coltrane also continued to tour with the second quartet up until two months before his death; his penultimate live performance and final recorded one, a radio broadcast for the Olatunji Center of African Culture in New York City, was eventually released as an album in 2001.

===1967: Illness and death===
Coltrane died of liver cancer at the age of 40 on July 17, 1967, at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. His funeral was held four days later at St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church in New York City. The service was started by the Albert Ayler Quartet and finished by the Ornette Coleman Quartet. Coltrane is buried at Pinelawn Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.

Biographer Lewis Porter speculated that the cause of Coltrane&#x27;s illness was hepatitis, although he also attributed the disease to Coltrane&#x27;s heroin use at a previous period in his life. Frederick J. Spencer wrote that Coltrane&#x27;s death could be attributed to his needle use &quot;or the bottle, or both.&quot; He stated that &quot;[t]he needles he used to inject the drugs may have had everything to do with&quot; Coltrane&#x27;s liver disease: &quot;If any needle was contaminated with the appropriate hepatitis virus, it may have caused a chronic infection leading to cirrhosis or cancer.&quot; He noted that despite Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; in 1957, &quot;[b]y then, he may have had chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis... Unless he developed a primary focus elsewhere in later life and that spread to his liver, the seeds of John Coltrane&#x27;s cancer were sown in his days of addiction.&quot;

Coltrane&#x27;s death surprised many in the music community who were unaware of his condition. Miles Davis said, &quot;Coltrane&#x27;s death shocked everyone, took everyone by surprise. I knew he hadn&#x27;t looked too good ... But I didn&#x27;t know he was that sick— or even sick at all.&quot;

==Instruments==
Coltrane started out on alto saxophone, but in 1947, when he joined King Kolax&#x27;s band, he switched to tenor saxophone, the instrument he became known for playing. In the early 1960s, during his contract with Atlantic, he also played soprano saxophone.

His preference for playing melody higher on the range of the tenor saxophone is attributed to his training on alto horn and clarinet. His &quot;sound concept&quot;, manipulated in one&#x27;s vocal tract, of the tenor was set higher than the normal range of the instrument. Coltrane observed how his experience playing the soprano saxophone gradually affected his style on the tenor, stating &quot;the soprano, by being this small instrument, I found that playing the lowest note on it was like playing ... one of the middle notes in the tenor ... I found that I would play &quot;all over&quot; this instrument ... And on tenor, I hadn&#x27;t always played all over it, because I was playing certain ideas which would just run in certain ranges ... By playing on the soprano and becoming accustomed to playing from that low B-flat on up, it soon got so when I went to tenor, I found myself doing the same thing ... And this caused ... the willingness to change and just try to play... as much of the instrument as possible.&quot;

Toward the end of his career, he experimented with flute in his live performances and studio recordings (&quot;Live at the Village Vanguard Again!&quot;, &quot;Expression&quot;). After Eric Dolphy died in June 1964, his mother gave Coltrane his flute and bass clarinet.

According to drummer Rashied Ali, Coltrane had an interest in the drums. He would often have a spare drum set on concert stages that he would play. His interest in the drums and his penchant for having solos with the drums resonated on tracks such as &quot;Pursuance&quot; and &quot;The Drum Thing&quot; from &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; and &quot;Crescent&quot;, respectively. It resulted in the album &quot;Interstellar Space&quot; with Ali. In an interview with Nat Hentoff in late 1965 or early 1966, Coltrane stated: &quot;I feel the need for more time, more rhythm all around me. And with more than one drummer, the rhythm can be more multi-directional.&quot; In an August 1966 interview with Frank Kofsky, Coltrane repeatedly emphasized his affinity for drums, saying &quot;I feel so strongly about drums, I really do.&quot; Later that year, Coltrane would record the music released posthumously on &quot;&quot;, which features Ali on drums supplemented by three percussionists.

Coltrane&#x27;s tenor (Selmer Mark VI, serial number 125571, dated 1965) and soprano (Selmer Mark VI, serial number 99626, dated 1962) saxophones were auctioned on February 20, 2005, to raise money for the John Coltrane Foundation.

Although he rarely played alto, he owned a prototype Yamaha alto saxophone given to him by the company as an endorsement in 1966. He can be heard playing it on live albums recorded in Japan, such as &quot;Second Night in Tokyo&quot;, and is pictured using it on the cover of the compilation &quot;Live in Japan&quot;. He can also be heard playing the Yamaha alto on the album &quot;Stellar Regions&quot;.

==Personal life and religious beliefs==

===Upbringing and early influences===
Coltrane was born and raised in a Christian home. He was influenced by religion and spirituality beginning in childhood. His maternal grandfather, the Reverend William Blair, was a minister at an African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in High Point, North Carolina, and his paternal grandfather, the Reverend William H. Coltrane, was an A.M.E. Zion minister in Hamlet, North Carolina. Critic Norman Weinstein observed the parallel between Coltrane&#x27;s music and his experience in the southern church, which included practicing music there as a youth.

===First marriage===
In 1955, Coltrane married Naima (née Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, a Muslim convert, heavily influenced his spirituality. When the couple married, she had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Syeeda. Coltrane adopted Syeeda. He met Naima at the home of bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, &quot;Naima&quot;, was Coltrane&#x27;s favorite composition. In 1956, the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter and moved to New York City. In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Syeeda moved into an apartment on 103rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue in New York. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home at 116–60 Mexico Street in St. Albans, Queens. This is the house where they would break up in 1963.

About the breakup, Naima said in J. C. Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Chasin&#x27; the Trane&quot;: &quot;I could feel it was going to happen sooner or later, so I wasn&#x27;t really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn&#x27;t offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, &#x27;Naima, I&#x27;m going to make a change.&#x27; Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn&#x27;t get over it for at least another year.&quot; But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90 percent of his playing would be prayer. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.

===1957 &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;===
In 1957, Coltrane had a religious experience that may have helped him overcome the heroin addiction and alcoholism he had struggled with since 1948. In the liner notes of &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, Coltrane states that in 1957 he experienced &quot;by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.&quot; Further evidence of this universal view can be found in the liner notes of &quot;Meditations&quot; (1965) in which Coltrane declares, &quot;I believe in all religions.&quot;

===Second marriage===
In 1963, he met pianist Alice McLeod. He and Alice moved in together and had two sons before he became &quot;officially divorced from Naima in 1966, at which time [he] and Alice were immediately married.&quot; John Jr. was born in 1964, Ravi in 1965, and Oranyan (&quot;Oran&quot;) in 1967. According to the musician Peter Lavezzoli, &quot;Alice brought happiness and stability to John&#x27;s life, not only because they had children, but also because they shared many of the same spiritual beliefs, particularly a mutual interest in Indian philosophy. Alice also understood what it was like to be a professional musician.&quot;

===Spiritual influence in music, religious exploration===
After &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, many of the titles of his songs and albums had spiritual connotations: &quot;Ascension&quot;, &quot;Meditations&quot;, &quot;Om&quot;, &quot;Selflessness&quot;, &quot;Amen&quot;, &quot;Ascent&quot;, &quot;Attaining&quot;, &quot;Dear Lord&quot;, &quot;Prayer and Meditation Suite&quot;, and &quot;The Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost&quot;. His library of books included &quot;The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna&quot;, the Bhagavad Gita, and Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;. The last of these describes, in Lavezzoli&#x27;s words, a &quot;search for universal truth, a journey that Coltrane had also undertaken. Yogananda believed that both Eastern and Western spiritual paths were efficacious, and wrote of the similarities between Krishna and Christ. This openness to different traditions resonated with Coltrane, who studied the Qur&#x27;an, the Bible, Kabbalah, and astrology with equal sincerity.&quot; He also explored Hinduism, Jiddu Krishnamurti, African history, the philosophical teachings of Plato and Aristotle, and Zen Buddhism.

In October 1965, Coltrane recorded &quot;Om&quot;, referring to the sacred syllable in Hinduism, which symbolizes the infinite or the entire universe. Coltrane described &quot;Om&quot; as the &quot;first syllable, the primal word, the word of power&quot;. The 29-minute recording contains chants from the Hindu &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and the Buddhist &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, and a recitation of a passage describing the primal verbalization &quot;om&quot; as a cosmic/spiritual common denominator in all things.

===Study of world music===
Coltrane&#x27;s spiritual journey was interwoven with his investigation of world music. He believed in not only a universal musical structure that transcended ethnic distinctions, but also being able to harness the mystical language of music itself. His study of Indian music led him to believe that certain sounds and scales could &quot;produce specific emotional meanings.&quot; According to Coltrane, the goal of a musician was to understand these forces, control them, and elicit a response from the audience. He said, &quot;I would like to bring to people something like happiness. I would like to discover a method so that if I want it to rain, it will start right away to rain. If one of my friends is ill, I&#x27;d like to play a certain song and he will be cured; when he&#x27;d be broke, I&#x27;d bring out a different song and immediately he&#x27;d receive all the money he needed.&quot;

== Veneration ==
After Coltrane&#x27;s death, a congregation called the Yardbird Temple in San Francisco began worshipping him as God incarnate. The group was named after Charlie &quot;Yardbird&quot; Parker, whom they equated to John the Baptist. The congregation became affiliated with the African Orthodox Church; this involved changing Coltrane&#x27;s status from a god to a saint. The resultant St. John Coltrane African Orthodox Church, San Francisco, is the only African Orthodox church that incorporates Coltrane&#x27;s music and his lyrics as prayers in its liturgy.

Rev. F. W. King, describing the African Orthodox Church of Saint John Coltrane, said &quot;We are Coltrane-conscious...God dwells in the musical majesty of his sounds.&quot;

Samuel G. Freedman wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that 
Coltrane is depicted as one of the 90 saints in the Dancing Saints icon of St. Gregory of Nyssa Episcopal Church in San Francisco. The icon is a painting in the Byzantine iconographic style that wraps around the entire church rotunda. It was executed by Mark Dukes, an ordained deacon at the Saint John Coltrane African Orthodox Church who painted other icons of Coltrane for the Coltrane Church. Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Newark, New Jersey, included Coltrane on its list of historical black saints and made a &quot;case for sainthood&quot; for him in an article on its website.

Documentaries about Coltrane and the church include Alan Klingenstein&#x27;s &quot;The Church of Saint Coltrane&quot; (1996), and a 2004 program presented by Alan Yentob for the BBC.

<text>The Soyuz programme ( , ; , meaning &quot;Union&quot;) is a human spaceflight programme initiated by the Soviet Union in the early 1960s. The Soyuz spacecraft was originally part of a Moon landing project intended to put a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. It was the third Soviet human spaceflight programme after the Vostok (1961–1963) and Voskhod (1964–1965) programmes.

The programme consists of the Soyuz capsule and the Soyuz rocket and is now the responsibility of the Russian Roscosmos. After the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, Soyuz was the only way for humans to get to the International Space Station (ISS) until 30 May 2020, when Crew Dragon flew to the ISS for the first time with astronauts.

==Soyuz rocket==
The launch vehicles used in the Soyuz expendable launch system are manufactured at the Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center (TsSKB-Progress) in Samara, Russia. As well as being used in the Soyuz programme as the launcher for the crewed Soyuz spacecraft, Soyuz launch vehicles are now also used to launch robotic Progress supply spacecraft to the International Space Station and commercial launches marketed and operated by TsSKB-Progress and the Starsem company. Currently Soyuz vehicles are launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwest Russia and, since 2011, Soyuz launch vehicles are also being launched from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. The Spaceport&#x27;s new Soyuz launch site has been handling Soyuz launches since 21 October 2011, the date of the first launch. As of December 2019, 19 Guiana Soyuz launches had been made from French Guiana Space Centre, all successful. 

The Soyuz rocket family is one of the most dependable and widely utilized launch vehicles in the history of space travel. It has been in operation for nearly six decades, having been developed by the Soviet Union and presently run by Russia. The Soyuz rockets have played an important role in both crewed and uncrewed space missions, launching people to the International Space Station (ISS) and delivering satellites and scientific payloads.

==Soyuz spacecraft==

The basic Soyuz spacecraft design was the basis for many projects, many of which were never developed. Its earliest form was intended to travel to the Moon without employing a huge booster like the Saturn V or the Soviet N-1 by repeatedly docking with upper stages that had been put in orbit using the same rocket as the Soyuz. This and the initial civilian designs were done under the Soviet Chief Designer Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, who did not live to see the craft take flight. Several military derivatives took precedence in the Soviet design process, though they never came to pass.

A Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back):
*a spheroid orbital module
*a small aerodynamic reentry module
*a cylindrical service module with solar panels attached

There have been many variants of the Soyuz spacecraft, including:
* Sever early crewed spacecraft proposal to replace Vostok (1959) 
**L1-1960 crewed circumlunar spacecraft proposal (1960); evolved into the Soyuz-A design
**L4-1960 crewed lunar orbiter proposal (1960)
**L1-1962 crewed lunar flyby spacecraft proposal (1962); early design led to Soyuz
**OS-1962 space station proposal (1962)
* Soyuz-A 7K-9K-11K circumlunar complex proposal (1963)
** Soyuz 7K crewed spacecraft concept; cancelled in 1964 in favor of the LK-1
** Soyuz 9K proposed orbital tug; cancelled in 1964 when the Soyuz 7K and Soyuz P were cancelled
** Soyuz 11K proposed fuel tanker; cancelled in 1964 when the Soyuz 7K and Soyuz P were cancelled
* L3-1963 crewed lunar lander proposal (1963)
* L4-1963 crewed lunar orbiter proposal; modified 7K (1963)
* Soyuz 7K-OK (1967–1970)
** Soyuz 7K-L1 Zond (1967–1970)
** Soyuz 7K-L3 LOK (1971–1972)
** Soyuz 7K-OKS (1971); also known as 7KT-OK
* Soyuz 7K-T or &quot;ferry&quot; (1973–1981)
**Soyuz 7K-T-AF (1973); 7K-T modified for space station flight with Orion 2 space telescope
** Soyuz 7K-T/A9 (1974–1978); 7K-T modified for flights to military Almaz space stations
* Soyuz 7K-TM (1974–1976)
** 7K-MF6 (1976); 7K-TM modified for space station flight with MKF-6 camera
* Soyuz-T (1976–1986)
* Zarya planned &#x27;Super Soyuz&#x27; replacement for Soyuz and Progress (1985)
** Alpha Lifeboat rescue spacecraft based on Zarya (1995); cancelled in favor of a modified Soyuz TM
** Big Soyuz enlarged version of Soyuz reentry vehicle (2008)
* Soyuz-TM (1986–2003)
* Soyuz TMA (2003–2012)
* Soyuz-ACTS (2006)
* Soyuz TMA-M (2010–2016)
* Soyuz MS (since 2016)
* Military Soyuz (P, PPK, R, 7K-VI Zvezda, and OIS)
** Soyuz P crewed satellite interceptor proposal (1962); cancelled in 1964 in favor of the Istrebitel Sputnikov program
** Soyuz R command-reconnaissance spacecraft proposal (1962); cancelled in 1966 and replaced by Almaz
*** Soyuz 7K-TK transport spacecraft proposal for delivering cosmonauts to Soyuz R military stations (1966); cancelled in 1970 in favor of the TKS spacecraft
** Soyuz PPK revised version of Soyuz P (1964)
** Soyuz 7K-VI Zvezda space station proposal (1964) 
** Soyuz-VI crewed combat spacecraft proposal; cancelled in 1965
** Soyuz OIS (1967)
*** Soyuz OB-VI space station proposal (1967)
*** Soyuz 7K-S military transport proposal (1974)
*** Soyuz 7K-ST concept for Soyuz T and TM (1974)

==Derivatives==
The Zond spacecraft was designed to take a crew around the Moon, but never achieved the required degree of safety or political need. Zond 5 did circle the Moon in September 1968, with two tortoises and other life forms, and returned safely to Earth although in an atmospheric entry which probably would have killed human travelers. 

The Progress series of robotic cargo ships for the Salyut, Mir, and ISS use the engine section, orbital module, automatic navigation, docking mechanism, and overall layout of the Soyuz spacecraft, but are incapable of reentry.

While not a direct derivative, the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft follows the basic template originally pioneered by Soyuz.

==Soyuz crewed flights==

* Soviet human spaceflight missions started in 1961 and ended in 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
* The Russian human spaceflight missions program started in 1991 and continues to this day. Soyuz crewed missions were the only spacecraft visiting the International Space Station, starting from when the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011, until the launch of Crew Dragon Demo-2 on 30 May 2020. The International Space Station always has at least one Soyuz spacecraft docked at all times for use as an escape craft.

<text>A terminal emulator, or terminal application, is a computer program that emulates a video terminal within some other display architecture. Though typically synonymous with a shell or text terminal, the term &quot;terminal&quot; covers all remote terminals, including graphical interfaces. A terminal emulator inside a graphical user interface is often called a terminal window.

A terminal window allows the user access to a text terminal and all its applications such as command-line interfaces (CLI) and text user interface (TUI) applications. These may be running either on the same machine or on a different one via telnet, ssh, dial-up, or over a direct serial connection. On Unix-like operating systems, it is common to have one or more terminal windows connected to the local machine.

Terminals usually support a set of escape sequences for controlling color, cursor position, etc. Examples include the family of terminal control sequence standards that includes ECMA-48, ANSI X3.64, and ISO/IEC 6429.

== Background ==

In the early days of computing, with the advent of interactive computing, the prevailing model involved a central computer connected to multiple terminals. This configuration, known as the centralized or mainframe model, featured a powerful central computer that performed all the processing tasks, while terminals served as input/output devices for users to interact with the system. These systems were initially character based.

=== Character-oriented terminals ===
== Emulators ==
When personal computers became ubiquitous in the 1980s, they offered the option of running software on the user&#x27;s personal computer, providing an opportunity to replace the expensive and space consuming hardware terminals with something that had additional functions. Immediately software became available, that could emulate the functions of the hardware terminals on a PC. Examples of such software for DOS were Telix or Telemate, which was published in 1988 and could emulate a DEC VT102 terminal.

Workstations, usually running versions of Unix, also became common in the 1980s. Unix systems usually provided access to the command line with locally-attached or dial-up terminals. Unix workstations were designed to be used primarily through a graphical user interface (GUI); to provide access to the command line, the GUI included terminal emulator applications that behaved like locally-attached terminals.

During the 1990s, new operating systems like Windows and OS/2 arrived, providing the technical background for more terminal emulators like Telix for Windows, ZOC for OS/2, or PuTTY, which was initially released for Windows in 1998 and which (together with its derivates) is still one a very popular choice to this day.

Through the success of Linux, especially running on data centers and cloud servers, the necessity of accessing remote computers through character based terminals remains. This is evident in the fact, that today lists of terminal emulators that could serve as alternative to the aforementioned PuTTY offers over 100 alternatives.

==Examples of terminals emulated==
Many terminal emulators have been developed for physical hardware terminals such as VT52, VT100, VT220, VT320, IBM 3270/8/9/E, IBM 5250, IBM 3179G, Data General D211, Hewlett-Packard HP700/92, Sperry/Unisys 2000-series UTS60, Burroughs/Unisys A-series T27/TD830/ET1100, ADDS ViewPoint, AT386, Siemens Nixdorf (SNI) 97801, Televideo 925, and Wyse 50/60.

Some terminal emulators, such as xterm, implement additional features not present in the emulated terminal.

Additionally, programs have been developed to emulate assorted system console &quot;terminals&quot; such as the Sun workstation console and the Linux console.

Finally, some emulators simply refer to a set of standards, such as the standards for ANSI escape codes.

Such programs are available on many platforms, including DOS, Unix-like systems including Linux and macOS, Windows, and embedded operating systems found in cellphones and industrial hardware.

== Implementation details ==

=== Unix-like systems ===
In the past, Unix and Unix-like systems used serial port devices such as RS-232 ports, and provided device files for them.

With terminal emulators these device files are themselves emulated by a pair of pseudoterminal devices. These in turn emulate a physical port/connection to the host computing endpoint – hardware provided by operating system APIs, or software such as rlogin, telnet or SSH, among others. In Linux systems, example, these would be (for the master side) and (for the slave side) pseudoterminal devices respectively.

There are also special virtual console files like codice_1. In text mode, writing to the file displays text on the virtual console and reading from the file returns text the user writes to the virtual console. As with other text terminals, there are also special escape sequences, control characters and functions that a program can use, most easily via a library such as &quot;ncurses&quot;. For more complex operations, the programs can use console and terminal special &quot;ioctl&quot; system calls. One can compare devices using the patterns vcs (&quot;virtual console screen&quot;) and vcsa (&quot;virtual console screen with attributes&quot;) such as codice_2 and codice_3.

Some terminal emulators also include escape sequences for configuring the behavior of the terminal to facilitate good interoperation between the terminal and programs running inside of it, for example to configure paste bracketing.

The virtual consoles can be configured in the file codice_4 read by &quot;init&quot;—typically it starts the text mode login process &quot;getty&quot; for several virtual consoles. X Window System can be configured in codice_4 or by an X display manager. A number of Linux distributions use systemd instead of init, which also allows virtual console configuration.

==== CLI tools ====
Typical Linux system programs used to access the virtual consoles include:

* to switch the current virtual console
* to run a program on a new virtual console
* to close a currently unused virtual console

===Local echo===
Terminal emulators may implement a local echo function, which may erroneously be named &quot;half-duplex&quot;, or still slightly incorrectly &quot;echoplex&quot; (which is formally an error detection mechanism rather than an input display option).

===Line-at-a-time mode/Local editing===
Terminal emulators may implement local editing, also known as &quot;line-at-a-time mode&quot;. This is also mistakenly referred to as &quot;half-duplex&quot;. In this mode, the terminal emulator only sends complete lines of input to the host system. The user enters and edits a line, but it is held locally within the terminal emulator as it is being edited. It is not transmitted until the user signals its completion, usually with the key on the keyboard or a &quot;send&quot; button of some sort in the user interface. At that point, the entire line is transmitted. Line-at-a-time mode implies local echo, since otherwise the user will not be able to see the line as it is being edited and constructed. However, line-at-a-time mode is independent of echo mode and does not &quot;require&quot; local echo. When entering a password, for example, line-at-a-time entry with local editing is possible, but local echo is turned off (otherwise the password would be displayed).

The complexities of line-at-a-time mode are exemplified by the line-at-a-time mode option in the telnet protocol. To implement it correctly, the &quot;Network Virtual Terminal&quot; implementation provided by the terminal emulator program must be capable of recognizing and properly dealing with &quot;interrupt&quot; and &quot;abort&quot; events that arrive in the middle of locally editing a line.

===Synchronous terminals===
In asynchronous terminals data can flow in any direction at any time. In synchronous terminals a protocol controls who may send data when. IBM 3270-based terminals used with IBM mainframe computers are an example of synchronous terminals. They operate in an essentially &quot;screen-at-a-time&quot; mode (also known as block mode). Users can make numerous changes to a page, before submitting the updated screen to the remote machine as a single action.

Terminal emulators that simulate the 3270 protocol are available for most operating systems, for use both by those administering systems such as the z9, as well as those using the corresponding applications such as CICS.

Other examples of synchronous terminals include the IBM 5250, ICL 7561, Honeywell Bull VIP7800 and Hewlett-Packard 700/92.

===Virtual consoles===

Virtual consoles, also called virtual terminals, are emulated text terminals, using the keyboard and monitor of a personal computer or workstation. The word &quot;text&quot; is key since virtual consoles are not GUI terminals and they do not run inside a graphical interface. Virtual consoles are found on most Unix-like systems. They are primarily used to access and interact with servers, without using a graphical desktop environment.

<doc id="53542" wikidata="Q499927" url="?curid=53542" title="Moscow, Idaho">
<text>Moscow ( ) is a city and the county seat of Latah County, Idaho. Located in the North Central region of the state along the border with Washington, it had a population of 25,435 at the 2020 United States census. Moscow is the home of the University of Idaho, the state&#x27;s land-grant institution and primary research university.

It is the principal city in the Moscow, Idaho Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Latah County. The city contains over 60% of the county&#x27;s population, and whilst the university is Moscow&#x27;s dominant employer, the city also serves as an agricultural and commercial hub for the Palouse region.

Along with the rest of the Idaho Panhandle, Moscow is in the Pacific Time Zone. The elevation of its city center is above sea level. Two major highways serve the city, passing through the city center: US-95 (north-south) and ID-8 (east-west). The Pullman–Moscow Regional Airport, west, provides limited commercial air service. The local newspaper is the &quot;Moscow-Pullman Daily News&quot;.

==History==

Indigenous people who inhabited what is now Moscow, Idaho include the Nez Perce, Palouse, and the Coeur d&#x27;Alene people (Schitsu’umsh).

===Community===
Miners and farmers began arriving in the northern Idaho area after the Civil War. The first permanent settlers came to the Moscow area in 1871. The abundance of camas bulbs, a favorite fodder of pigs brought by the farmers, led to naming the vicinity &quot;Hog Heaven.&quot; When the first US post office opened in 1872, the town was called &quot;Paradise Valley,&quot; but the name changed to &quot;Moscow&quot; in 1875. The name Paradise persists in the main waterway through town, Paradise Creek, which originates at the west end of the Palouse Range, flows south to the Troy Highway, and west to Pullman where it enters the South Fork of the Palouse River.

Historians have disputed the precise origin of the name &quot;Moscow&quot;. There is no conclusive proof that it is connected to the Russian capital, though various accounts suggest it purposely evoked the Russian city or was named by Russian immigrants. Another account claims that the name derives from a Native American tribe named &quot;Masco&quot;. Early settlers reported that five local men met to choose a proper name for the town, but could not agree. The postmaster, Samuel Neff, then completed the official papers for the town and chose &quot;Moscow&quot; for the name. Neff was born in Moscow, Pennsylvania.

By 1875, the town had a business district that was a center of commerce for the region. By 1890, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company&#x27;s rail line (later the Union Pacific) and the Northern Pacific railroad line helped boost the town&#x27;s population to 2,000.

The capital of the Idaho Territory was relocated from Lewiston to Boise in December 1864. In the late 1880s, statehood for the Washington Territory was nearing. Because its commercial and transportation interests looked west, rather than south, the citizens of the Idaho Panhandle passionately lobbied for their region to join Washington, or to form an entirely separate state, rather than remain connected with the less accessible southern Idaho. To appease the residents of the north, the territorial legislature of Idaho in Boise placed the new land grant university in Moscow, which at the time was the largest city other than Boise in the state. The University of Idaho was chartered in January 1889, and first opened its doors to students in October 1892.

In March 1890, Moscow&#x27;s neighboring city, Pullman, became the home of Washington&#x27;s land grant institution. The college that became Washington State University opened its doors in January 1892. Washington entered the union as the 42nd state in November 1889 and Idaho entered next, eight months later, in July 1890.

===Moscow City Hall and Old Post Office===

===Moscow Public Library===
Members of the Pleiades Club and Ladies&#x27; Historical Club formed a cooperative named the Women&#x27;s Reading Room Society and established a small library in the Browne building at the corner of Main and Second Streets in 1902.

In 1904, the committee planned to raise funds for a new library building. Andrew Carnegie promised funding of $10,000 if the community agreed to maintain a free public library at the rate of at least $1000 annually. Moscow voters approved a permanent tax in 1905 and with successful fundraising by subscription of local residents and businesses, coupled with the Carnegie library money, the library construction was begun in 1905. In March 1906, the Mission Style building was ready for occupancy. Later that month, a fire at the university&#x27;s Administration Building totally destroyed that structure, so the new library was used for university classes during the day and residents used the library in the evening. Beginning in 1907 the building was returned to full use as a library. The original library building (which is on the National Register of Historic Places) was expanded in 1931 and 1983. It houses a children&#x27;s room named for Moscow native Carol Ryrie Brink, the author of 1936 Newbery Medal winner &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot;.

In 2006, the Friends of the Library celebrated a Century of Service for the organization. The current organizational structure of library service encompasses all public libraries in Latah County as the Latah County Library District. The library enjoys broad support from the citizens of Moscow and the county and is also supported by the Idaho Commission for Libraries (formerly the Idaho State Library.)

The Moscow Public Library currently houses about 60% of Latah County Library District&#x27;s 100,000 volume collection. Administrative, technical, youth services, and branch services offices for the Library District are all housed at this location as well. The library offers year-round programming for all ages, including storytimes and a summer reading program for children, book clubs for teenagers and adults, and presentations by outside experts and organizations. The library also offers public Internet access computers as well as free wifi.

The library serves as resource for all the residents of Moscow, or as one essayist (Ellis Clark) in the 2006 contest states, &quot;When time, money, or circumstances bind you to one locale, the Library is your passport for travel.&quot;

===1970 to 2009===
The opening of Moscow Mall (now Eastside Marketplace) and Palouse Empire Mall (now Palouse Mall) in the late 1970s shifted many retail businesses away from the aging city center, with buildings dating to the 1890s. The city developed a revitalization project for downtown in the early 1970s that included a major traffic revision, which was enacted in 1981. Traffic from US 95 on Main Street was diverted a block away to one-way corridors on Washington (northbound) and Jackson (southbound) streets, to alleviate congestion and improve pedestrian safety and the overall city center experience. Main Street was converted from four busy lanes with metered parallel parking to two lanes of local retail traffic with free diagonal parking; its sidewalks were modified and trees were added. At the north end of Moscow, southbound highway traffic divided west at &#x27;D&#x27; Street to Jackson and returned to Main at 8th; the northbound route divided east at 8th, but returned to Main four blocks earlier in the north end, 

The original 90-degree couplets of 1981 used existing streets of the grid. Planners intended these as temporary, but they remained for years. The primary safety hazard was inexperienced truck drivers—excessive speed through the tight corners led to toppled loads and subsequent traffic snarls, with occasional damage to adjacent structures. The new, straighter couplets at the north end are both over a block in length and eliminated existing structures. The return couplet from Washington Street runs from 1st Street to beyond &#x27;A&#x27; Street; it eliminated the original front portion (white stucco chapel) of the Corner Club tavern at the northeast corner of &#x27;A&#x27; and Main, which was demolished in early 1991 after staving off its elimination for over a decade. The building on the southeast corner, was razed for the traffic project in 1977 and was a vacant lot for 

The first of the new couplets was completed during the summer of 1991. The new southbound couplet to Jackson Street was completed the following year in 1992 and begins north of &#x27;C&#x27; Street. It eliminated a former service station at the northwest corner of &#x27;C&#x27; and Main, which had been converted to other retail for over a decade. The critical couplet at the south end of the city was delayed several times for various reasons. Completed in 2000, it is two blocks south and one block east of the 1981 divider at 8th Street. After Sweet Avenue, northbound Main Street bends a block east to align with northbound one-way Washington Street, intersecting the two-way Troy Highway from the southeast. Southbound US 95 traffic joins the intersection from the northwest, arriving on a one-way diagonal from Jackson Street. Agricultural buildings on the block between Jackson and Main (College St. to Lewis St.) were razed in the late 1990s to complete this new corridor. The completion of the south couplet allowed Gritman Medical Center to expand southward, over Eighth Street.

Another significant change to local commerce was the increase of the state&#x27;s legal drinking age to 21 in April 1987, after nearly fifteen years at age 19. Many establishments that relied on revenues from 19- and 20-year-olds from the two university communities had to adjust or cease operations. Prior to the lowering to 19 in July 1972, the drinking age in Idaho was 20 for beer and 21 for liquor and wine.
A fixture of the Moscow skyline for nearly a century, the concrete grain elevators on south Main Street were demolished in March 2007. Located on the southwest corner of 8th &amp; Main, the elevators were last operated by the Latah County Grain Growers. The other major concrete elevator complex, on Jackson Street south of 6th, was also slated for the wrecking ball. Idle since 2005, a preservationist group saved it in 2007. Its newer large-diameter metal silo hosted summer theater productions in 2011.

===2010 to present===
Moscow is known internationally as the location of Christ Church and its associated ministries: Canon Press and New Saint Andrews College, as well as Logos School. Crawford Gribben suggests that Moscow is &quot;America&#x27;s most postmillennial town&quot;, since the town&#x27;s two explicitly postmillennial congregations (Christ Church and Trinity Reformed Church), make up about 10% of the town&#x27;s permanent population.

In the early morning hours of November 13, 2022, four University of Idaho students were stabbed to death in an off-campus rented home in Moscow by one or more attackers using one or more long knives. The authorities have identified a suspect who faces four counts of first degree murder and one count burglary.

==Geography==
Main Street runs north–south through Moscow along the 117th meridian west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Moscow lies on the eastern edge of the Palouse region of north central Idaho in the Columbia River Plateau. East of the city is a valley within the mountains of the Palouse Range to the northeast, whose highest point is Moscow Mountain at above sea level. The less prominent Paradise Ridge at and Tomer Butte at are southeast of the city. Paradise Creek, with headwaters on Moscow Mountain to the northeast, flows through Moscow, then crosses the state border and joins the south fork of the Palouse River near Pullman, which eventually drains into the Snake River and Columbia River on its way to the Pacific Ocean.

The geology in and around Moscow represents varied formations: very old intrusive granite structures of the Jurassic−Eocene Idaho Batholith, fertile fields atop rolling hills of deep Pleistocene loess of the Palouse Formation deposited after the last ice age by westerly winds, and flood-worn channels of the Columbia River Basalt Group.

There is a variety of flora and fauna within the vicinity of Moscow. An amphibian, the Rough-skinned Newt, has a disjunctive population at Moscow; this species is found typically along the Pacific coast of the US. The city sits at the boundary between the Palouse grasslands and wheat fields, and the conifer forests of the Rocky Mountains to the east.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Moscow has either a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;) or a dry-summer continental climate (&quot;Dsb&quot;).

== Arts and culture ==
The city was highlighted in a comedy special at University of Idaho by actor-comedian Yakov Smirnoff, filmed in late 1990. Using Moscow as its setting pokes fun at Smirnoff emigrating from Moscow, Russia.

==Parks and recreation==
There are seventeen neighborhood parks located throughout the town offering a wide variety of venues for outdoor activities. These parks fall under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Parks and Recreation Department. The Moscow Pathways Commission (formerly Paradise Path Task Force) is a citizen committee seeking to develop a system of linearly connected parks throughout the area. Carol Ryrie Brink Nature Park was a community collaboration between the Palouse Clearwater Environmental Institute and local volunteers to remeander Paradise Creek and add riparian plantings. The Moscow community, including schools and the city, led by local youth, raised money over several years to fund, design, and build a skate park that was completed in 2000. A park just north of the university is named for Admiral Robert Ghormley, from 1933 to 1997, it was the site of the city&#x27;s outdoor swimming pool. Its replacement, the Hamilton-Lowe Aquatics Center in northeast Moscow, opened in June 2000.

The Latah Trail, completed in October 2008, extends from the eastern edge of Moscow bike path system to Troy, parallel to the Troy Highway (SH-8) for most of its . On the west side of Moscow, the Bill Chipman Palouse Trail connects the two university communities of the Palouse. Starting at the University of Idaho&#x27;s Perimeter Road, it gradually descends with Paradise Creek for to Pullman through Whitman County, alongside the Moscow-Pullman Highway. Completed in April 1998, the trail honors a Pullman businessman (and UI alumnus) who died two years earlier, following a winter highway accident in Spokane County. The Paradise Path bridges the gap in Moscow between the endpoints of the Chipman and Latah trails, passing through the north and east edges of the UI campus. The trail systems together constitute a continuous paved linear park from Pullman to Troy, extending in Troy beyond the eastern boundary of the Palouse ecosystem. From Pullman to the western boundary of Moscow (the state line), it follows the right of way of a dismantled Union Pacific railroad line, and east of US-95 it follows the right of way of a dismantled BNSF railroad line that junctioned at Arrow on the Clearwater River by way of Troy, Kendrick, and Juliaetta.

The defunct Tamarack Ski Area was on the east-facing slope of East Moscow Mountain; a grove of ancient red cedar trees is nearby, just northeast of Moscow Mountain&#x27;s summit.

==Government==
Moscow has a Mayor-Council form of government consisting of six Council members (at large) and a Mayor. These positions are elected separately and serve four year terms. Council member elections are held in odd-numbered years in November, with terms staggered so that three of the six seats are open at each election. Mayoral elections are held the November after a US presidential election.

The Council elects a President and vice-president from among its members at its first meeting in January each year. These two officers may stand in for the mayor as necessary. Council is the legislative and judicial arm of Moscow&#x27;s City government; enacting ordinances and resolutions. This body confirms the Mayor&#x27;s appointments of City officials and citizen advisory commission members. Council approves the city&#x27;s annual budget and serves as the convening body for public hearings and appeals of other City Boards and Commissions. Meetings are generally scheduled for the first and third Monday of each month, beginning at 7:00 p.m.

==Education==
===Higher education===
The University of Idaho (officially abbreviated &quot;U of I&quot;) is Idaho&#x27;s oldest public university, located in the city of Moscow in Latah County in the northern portion of the state. It is the state&#x27;s flagship, land-grant, and primary research university. The University of Idaho was the state&#x27;s sole university for 71 years, until 1963, and its College of Law, established in 1909, was first accredited by the American Bar Association in 1925.

Formed by the territorial legislature on January 30, 1889, the university opened its doors in 1892 on October 3, with an initial class of 40 students. The first graduating class in 1896 contained two men and two women. It presently has an enrollment exceeding 12,000, with over 11,000 on the Moscow campus. The university offers 142 degree programs, including bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, doctoral, and specialists&#x27; degrees. Certificates of completion are offered in 30 areas of study. At 25% and 53%, its 4 and 6 year graduation rates are the highest of any public university in Idaho, and it generates 74% of all research money in the state, with research expenditures of $100 million in 2010 alone.

As a land-grant university and the primary research university in the state, UI has the largest campus in the state at , located in the hills of the Palouse region. The school is home to the Idaho Vandals, who competed on the Division I FBS (formerly I-A) level through the 2017 season before dropping down to the FCS level in 2018. In addition to the main campus in Moscow, the UI has branch campuses in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Boise, Twin Falls, and Idaho Falls. It also operates a research park in Post Falls and dozens of extension offices statewide.

New Saint Andrews College opened in 1994 and moved to its present campus on Main Street in 2003.

<doc id="53543" wikidata="Q468739" url="?curid=53543" title="Domestication of the horse">
<text>It is not entirely clear how, when or where the domestication of the horse took place. Although horses appeared in Paleolithic cave art as early as 30,000 BCE, these were wild horses and were probably hunted for meat. The clearest evidence of early use of the horse as a means of transport is from chariot burials dated . However, an increasing amount of evidence began to support the hypothesis that horses were domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes in approximately 3500 BCE.
Discoveries in the context of the Botai culture had suggested that Botai settlements in the Akmola Province of Kazakhstan are the location of the earliest domestication of the horse. Warmuth et al. (2012) pointed to horses having been domesticated around 3000 BCE in what is now Ukraine and Western Kazakhstan. The evidence is disputed by archaeozoologist Williams T. Taylor, who argues that domestication did not take place until around 2000 BCE.

Genetic evidence indicates that domestication of the modern horse&#x27;s ancestors likely occurred in an area known as the Volga–Don, in the Pontic–Caspian steppe region of eastern Europe, around 2200 BCE. From there, use of horses spread across Eurasia for transportation, agricultural work, and warfare. Scientists have linked the successful spread of domesticated horses to observed genetic changes. They speculate that stronger backs (GSDMC gene) and increased docility (ZFPM1 gene) may have made horses more suitable for riding.

==Background==
The date of the domestication of the horse depends to some degree upon the definition of &quot;domestication&quot;. Some zoologists define &quot;domestication&quot; as human control over breeding, which can be detected in ancient skeletal samples by changes in the size and variability of ancient horse populations. Other researchers look at the broader evidence, including skeletal and dental evidence of working activity; weapons, art, and spiritual artifacts; and lifestyle patterns of human cultures. There is evidence that horses were kept as a source of meat and milk before they were trained as working animals.

Attempts to date domestication by genetic study or analysis of physical remains rest on the assumption that there was a separation of the genotypes of domesticated and wild populations. Such a separation appears to have taken place, but dates based on such methods can only produce an estimate of the latest possible date for domestication without excluding the possibility of an unknown period of earlier gene flow between wild and domestic populations (which will occur naturally as long as the domesticated population is kept within the habitat of the wild population). 

Whether one adopts the narrower zoological definition of domestication or the broader cultural definition that rests on an array of zoological and archaeological evidence affects the time frame chosen for the domestication of the horse. The date of 4000 BCE is based on evidence that includes the appearance of dental pathologies associated with bitting, changes in butchering practices, changes in human economies and settlement patterns, the depiction of horses as symbols of power in artifacts, and the appearance of horse bones in human graves. On the other hand, measurable changes in size and increases in variability associated with domestication occurred later, about 2500–2000 BCE, as seen in horse remains found at the site of Csepel-Haros in Hungary, a settlement of the Bell Beaker culture.

Use of horses spread across Eurasia for transportation, agricultural work and warfare. Horses and mules in agriculture used a breastplate type harness or a yoke more suitable for oxen, which was not as efficient at utilizing the full strength of the animals as the later-invented padded horse collar that arose several millennia later.

==Predecessors to the domestic horse==

A 2005 study analyzed the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of a worldwide range of equids, from 53,000-year-old fossils to contemporary horses. Their analysis placed all equids into a single clade, or group with a single common ancestor, consisting of three genetically divergent species: the South American &quot;Hippidion&quot;, the North American New World stilt-legged horse, and &quot;Equus&quot;, the true horse. The true horse included prehistoric horses and the Przewalski&#x27;s horse, as well as what is now the modern domestic horse, belonged to a single Holarctic species.

The true horse migrated from the Americas to Eurasia via Beringia, becoming broadly distributed from North America to central Europe, north and south of Pleistocene ice sheets. It became extinct in Beringia around 14,200 years ago, and in the rest of the Americas around 10,000 years ago. This clade survived in Eurasia, however, and it is from these horses which all domestic horses appear to have descended. These horses showed little phylogeographic structure, probably reflecting their high degree of mobility and adaptability.

Therefore, the domestic horse today is classified as &quot;Equus ferus caballus&quot;. No genetic originals of native wild horses currently exist. The Przewalski diverged from the modern horse before domestication. It has 66 chromosomes, as opposed to 64 among modern domesticated horses, and their Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) forms a distinct cluster. Genetic evidence suggests that modern Przewalski&#x27;s horses are descended from a distinct regional gene pool in the eastern part of the Eurasian steppes, not from the same genetic group that gave rise to modern domesticated horses. Nevertheless, evidence such as the cave paintings of Lascaux suggests that the ancient wild horses that some researchers now label the &quot;Tarpan subtype&quot; probably resembled Przewalski horses in their general appearance: big heads, dun coloration, thick necks, stiff upright manes, and relatively short, stout legs.
The horses of the Ice Age were hunted for meat in Europe and across the Eurasian steppes and in North America by early modern humans. Numerous kill sites exist and many cave paintings in Europe indicate what they looked like. Many of these Ice Age subspecies died out during the rapid climate changes associated with the end of the last Ice Age particularly in North America, where the horse became completely extinct.

Two undomesticated sub-species survived into historic times: Przewalski&#x27;s horse (&quot;Equus ferus przewalski&quot;) and the Tarpan (&quot;Equus ferus ferus&quot;). The Tarpan became extinct in the late 19th century and Przewalski&#x27;s horse is endangered; it became extinct in the wild during the late 1960s, but was re-introduced in the early 1990s to two preserves in Mongolia. Although researchers such as Marija Gimbutas theorized that the horses of the Chalcolithic (Copper Age) were Przewalski&#x27;s, more recent genetic studies indicate that Przewalski&#x27;s horse is not an ancestor to modern domesticated horses.

==Genetic evidence==

A 2014 study compared DNA from ancient horse bones that predated domestication and compared them to DNA of modern horses, discovering 125 genes that correlated to domestication. Some were physical, affecting muscle and limb development, cardiac strength and balance. Others were linked to cognitive function and most likely were critical to the taming of the horse, including social behavior, learning capabilities, fear response, and agreeableness. The DNA used in this study came from horse bones 16,000 to 43,000 years ago, and therefore the precise changes that occurred at the time of domestication have yet to be sequenced.

The domestication of stallions and mares can be analyzed separately by looking at those portions of the DNA that are passed on exclusively along the maternal (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA) or paternal line (Y-chromosome or Y-DNA). DNA studies indicate that there may have been multiple domestication events for mares, as the number of female lines required to account for the genetic diversity of the modern horse suggests a minimum of 77 different ancestral mares, divided into 17 distinct lineages. Studies of modern horses showed very little Y chromosome diversity, which was originally interpreted as evidence of a single domestication event for a limited number of stallions combined with repeated restocking of wild females into the domesticated herds. However, more recent studies of ancient DNA show that Y chromosome diversity was significantly higher a thousand years ago. The low present diversity may be partially explained by the popularity of Arabian and Turkoman studs, especially the three foundation stallions of the Thoroughbred breed.

A study published in 2012 that performed genomic sampling on 300 work horses from local areas as well as a review of previous studies of archaeology, mitochondrial DNA, and Y-DNA suggested that horses were originally domesticated in the western part of the Eurasian steppe. Both domesticated stallions and mares spread out from this area, and then additional wild mares were added from local herds; wild mares were easier to handle than wild stallions. Most other parts of the world were ruled out as sites for horse domestication, either due to climate unsuitable for an indigenous wild horse population or no evidence of domestication.

Genes located on the Y-chromosome are inherited only from sire to its male offspring and these lines show a very reduced degree of genetic variation (aka genetic homogeneity) in modern domestic horses, far less than expected based on the overall genetic variation in the remaining genetic material. This indicates that a relatively few stallions were domesticated and that it is unlikely that many male offspring originating from unions between wild stallions and domestic mares were included in early domesticated breeding stock.

Genes located in the mitochondrial DNA are passed on along the maternal line from the mother to her offspring. Multiple analyses of the mitochondrial DNA obtained from modern horses as well as from horse bones and teeth from archaeological and palaeological finds consistently shows an increased genetic diversity in the mitochondrial DNA compared to the remaining DNA, showing that a large number of mares has been included into the breeding stock of the originally domesticated horse. 

Variation in the mitochondrial DNA is used to determine so-called haplogroups. A haplogroup is a group of closely related haplotypes that share the same common ancestor. In horses, eighteen main haplogroups are recognized (A-R). Several haplogroups are unequally distributed around the world, indicating the addition of local wild mares to the domesticated stock.

In 2018, genomic comparison of 42 ancient-horse genomes, 20 of which were from Botai, with 46 published ancient and modern-horse genomes yielded surprising results. It was found that modern domestic horses are not closely related to the horses at Botai. Rather, Przewalski’s horses were identified as feral descendants of horses herded at Botai. Evidence suggested that &quot;a massive genomic turnover&quot; had occurred along with the domestication of horses and large-scale human population expansion in the Early Bronze Age.
Subsequent research showed that horse lineages from Iberia and Siberia, also associated with early domestication, had little influence on the genetics of modern domestic horses.

More than 150 scientists collaborated in gathering 264 ancient horse genomes from across Eurasia, dating from 50,000 to 200 B.C.E. In October 2021, results of the analysis were published in &quot;Nature&quot;. They indicated that domestication of the modern horse&#x27;s ancestors likely occurred in the Volga-Don region of the Pontic–Caspian steppe grasslands of Western Eurasia. Both Tarpan and Przewalski’s horse were related to different ancestral populations than those underlying the modern domestic horses (DOM2). 

In addition, researchers were able to map population changes over time as modern domestic horses expanded rapidly across Eurasia and displaced other local populations, from about 2000 BCE onwards. The genetic profile for DOM2 horses is associated with horses buried in Sintashta kurgans with early spoke-wheeled chariots, and with horses in Central Anatolia where two-wheeled vehicles were depicted. DOM2 horses also occur in some areas prior to the earliest evidence for chariots, suggesting that both horseback riding and chariot use were factors in expansion.

Genetic data may also provide clues as to why this particular domestication event had far more widespread impact than other domestication events in Botai, Iberia, SIberia and Anatolia. The genetic lineage that leads to modern domestic horses shows evidence of strong selection for locomotor and behavioural adaptations. Changes relate to the GSDMC gene and the ZFPM1 gene. The GSDMC gene is linked to back problems in people, and scientists speculate that changes may have made horses&#x27; backs stronger. The ZFPM1 gene is related to mood regulation, and scientists speculate that this may have made horses more docile and easier to tame and manage. Strength and docility would have made horses more suitable for riding and other uses.

==Archaeological evidence==

Archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from three kinds of sources: 1) changes in the skeletons and teeth of ancient horses; 2) changes in the geographic distribution of ancient horses, particularly the introduction of horses into regions where no wild horses had existed; and
3) archaeological sites containing artifacts, images, or evidence of changes in human behavior connected with horses.

Examples include horse remains interred in human graves; changes in the ages and sexes of the horses killed by humans; the appearance of horse corrals; equipment such as bits or other types of horse tack; horses interred with equipment intended for use by horses, such as chariots; and depictions of horses used for equestrianism, driving, draught work, or symbols of human power.

Few of these categories, taken alone, provide irrefutable evidence of domestication, but the cumulative evidence becomes increasingly more persuasive.
===Horses interred with chariots===
The least ancient, but most persuasive, evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse leg bones and skulls, probably originally attached to hides, were interred with the remains of chariots in at least 16 graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures. These were located in the steppes southeast of the Ural Mountains, between the upper Ural and upper Tobol Rivers, a region today divided between southern Russia and northern Kazakhstan. Petrovka was a little later than and probably grew out of Sintashta, and the two complexes together spanned about 2100–1700 BCE. A few of these graves contained the remains of as many as eight sacrificed horses placed in, above, and beside the grave.

In all of the dated chariot graves, the heads and hooves of a pair of horses were placed in a grave that once contained a chariot. Evidence of chariots in these graves was inferred from the impressions of two spoked wheels set in grave floors 1.2–1.6m apart; in most cases the rest of the vehicle left no trace. In addition, a pair of disk-shaped antler &quot;cheekpieces,&quot; an ancient predecessor to a modern bit shank or bit ring, were placed in pairs beside each horse head-and-hoof sacrifice. The inner faces of the disks had protruding prongs or studs that would have pressed against the horse&#x27;s lips when the reins were pulled on the opposite side. Studded cheekpieces were a new and fairly severe kind of control device that appeared simultaneously with chariots.

All of the dated chariot graves contained wheel impressions, horse bones, weapons (arrow and javelin points, axes, daggers, or stone mace-heads), human skeletal remains, and cheekpieces. Because they were buried in teams of two with chariots and studded cheekpieces, the evidence is extremely persuasive that these steppe horses of 2100–1700 BCE were domesticated. Shortly after the period of these burials, the expansion of the domestic horse throughout Europe was little short of explosive. In the space of possibly 500 years, there is evidence of horse-drawn chariots in Greece, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. By another 500 years, the horse-drawn chariot had spread to China.

===Skeletal indicators of domestication===
Some researchers do not consider an animal to be &quot;domesticated&quot; until it exhibits physical changes consistent with selective breeding, or at least having been born and raised entirely in captivity. Until that point, they classify captive animals as merely &quot;tamed&quot;. Those who hold to this theory of domestication point to a change in skeletal measurements detected among horse bones recovered from middens dated about 2500 BCE in eastern Hungary in Bell-Beaker sites, and in later Bronze Age sites in the Russian steppes, Spain, and Eastern Europe. Horse bones from these contexts exhibited an increase in variability, thought to reflect the survival under human care of both larger and smaller individuals than appeared in the wild; and a decrease in average size, thought to reflect penning and restriction in diet. Horse populations that showed this combination of skeletal changes probably were domesticated. Most evidence suggests that horses were increasingly controlled by humans after about 2500 BCE. However, more recently there have been skeletal remains found at a site in Kazakhstan which display the smaller, more slender limbs characteristic of corralled animals, dated to 3500 BCE.

===Botai culture===
Some of the most intriguing evidence of early domestication comes from the Botai culture, found in northern Kazakhstan. The Botai culture was a culture of foragers who seem to have adopted horseback riding in order to hunt the abundant wild horses of northern Kazakhstan between 3500 and 3000 BCE. Botai sites had no cattle or sheep bones; the only domesticated animals, in addition to horses, were dogs. Botai settlements in this period contained between 50 and 150 pit houses. Garbage deposits contained tens to hundreds of thousands of discarded animal bones, 65% to 99% of which had come from horses. Also, there has been evidence found of horse milking at these sites, with horse milk fats soaked into pottery shards dating to 3500 BCE. Earlier hunter-gatherers who lived in the same region had not hunted wild horses with such success, and lived for millennia in smaller, more shifting settlements, often containing less than 200 wild animal bones.

Entire herds of horses were slaughtered by the Botai hunters, apparently in hunting drives. The adoption of horseback riding might explain the emergence of specialised horse-hunting techniques and larger, more permanent settlements. Domesticated horses could have been adopted from neighboring herding societies in the steppes west of the Ural Mountains, where the Khvalynsk culture had herds of cattle and sheep, and perhaps had domesticated horses, as early as 4800 BCE.

Other researchers have argued that all of the Botai horses were wild, and that the horse-hunters of Botai hunted wild horses on foot. As evidence, they note that zoologists have found no skeletal changes in the Botai horses that indicate domestication. Moreover, because they were hunted for food, the majority of the horse remains found in Botai-culture settlements indeed probably were wild. On the other hand, any domesticated riding horses were probably the same size as their wild cousins and cannot now be distinguished by bone measurements. They also note that the age structure of the horses slaughtered at Botai represents a natural demographic profile for hunted animals, not the pattern expected if they were domesticated and selected for slaughter. However, these arguments were published before a Copper Age corral was discovered at Krasnyi Yar in 2006 and mats of horse-dung at two other Botai sites. Current findings continue to support the Botai as having domesticated horses.

A study in 2018 revealed that the Botai horses did not contribute significantly to the genetics of modern domesticated horses, and that therefore a subsequent and separate domestication event must have been responsible for the modern domestic horse. Genetic evidence also connects Botai horses with Przewalski&#x27;s horse in Mongolia, which has led to debates over whether Przewalski&#x27;s horses should be considered a never-domesticated population or feral descendants of domesticated Botai horses.

===Bit wear===
The presence of bit wear is an indicator that a horse was ridden or driven, and the earliest of such evidence from a site in Kazakhstan dates to 3500 BCE. The absence of bit wear on horse teeth is not conclusive evidence against domestication because horses can be ridden and controlled without bits by using a noseband or a hackamore, but such materials do not produce significant physiological changes nor are they apt to be preserved for millennia.

The regular use of a bit to control a horse can create wear facets or bevels on the anterior corners of the lower second premolars. The corners of the horse&#x27;s mouth normally keep the bit on the &quot;bars&quot; of the mouth, an interdental space where there are no teeth, forward of the premolars. The bit must be manipulated by a human or the horse must move it with its tongue for it to touch the teeth. Wear can be caused by the bit abrading the front corners of the premolars if the horse grasps and releases the bit between its teeth; other wear can be created by the bit striking the vertical front edge of the lower premolars, due to very strong pressure from a human handler.

Modern experiments showed that even organic bits of rope or leather can create significant wear facets, and also showed that facets 3mm (.118 in) deep or more do not appear on the premolars of wild horses. However, other researchers disputed both conclusions.

Wear facets of 3 mm or more were found on seven horse premolars in two sites of the Botai culture, Botai and Kozhai 1, dated about 3500–3000 BCE. The Botai culture premolars are the earliest reported multiple examples of this dental pathology in any archaeological site, and preceded any skeletal change indicators by 1,000 years. While wear facets more than 3 mm deep were discovered on the lower second premolars of a single stallion from Dereivka in Ukraine, an Eneolithic settlement dated about 4000 BCE, dental material from one of the worn teeth later produced a radiocarbon date of 700–200 BCE, indicating that this stallion was actually deposited in a pit dug into the older Eneolithic site during the Iron Age.

===Dung and corrals===
Soil scientists working with Sandra Olsen of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History at the Chalcolithic settlements of Botai and Krasnyi Yar in northern Kazakhstan found layers of horse dung, discarded in unused house pits in both settlements. The collection and disposal of horse dung suggests that horses were confined in corrals or stables. An actual corral, dated to 3500–3000 BCE was identified at Krasnyi Yar by a pattern of post holes for a circular fence, with the soils inside the fence yielding ten times more phosphorus than the soils outside. The phosphorus could represent the remains of manure.

===Geographic expansion===
The appearance of horse remains in human settlements in regions where they had not previously been present is another indicator of domestication. Although images of horses appear as early as the Upper Paleolithic period in places such as the caves of Lascaux, France, suggesting that wild horses lived in regions outside of the Eurasian steppes before domestication and may have even been hunted by early humans, concentration of remains suggests animals being deliberately captured and contained, an indicator of domestication, at least for food, if not necessarily use as a working animal.

Around 3500–3000 BCE, horse bones began to appear more frequently in archaeological sites beyond their center of distribution in the Eurasian steppes and were seen in central Europe, the middle and lower Danube valley, and the North Caucasus and Transcaucasia. Evidence of horses in these areas had been rare before, and as numbers increased, larger animals also began to appear in horse remains. This expansion in range was contemporary with the Botai culture, where there are indications that horses were corralled and ridden. This does not necessarily mean that horses were first domesticated in the steppes, but the horse-hunters of the steppes certainly pursued wild horses more than in any other region.

European wild horses were hunted for up to 10% of the animal bones in a handful of Mesolithic and Neolithic settlements scattered across Spain, France, and the marshlands of northern Germany, but in many other parts of Europe, including Greece, the Balkans, the British Isles, and much of central Europe, horse bones do not occur or occur very rarely in Mesolithic, Neolithic or Chalcolithic sites. In contrast, wild horse bones regularly exceeded 40% of the identified animal bones in Mesolithic and Neolithic camps in the Eurasian steppes, west of the Ural Mountains.

Horse bones were rare or absent in Neolithic and Chalcolithic kitchen garbage in western Turkey, Mesopotamia, most of Iran, South and Central Asia, and much of Europe. While horse bones have been identified in Neolithic sites in central Turkey, all equids together totaled less than 3% of the animal bones. Within this three percent, horses were less than 10%, with 90% or more of the equids represented by onagers (&quot;Equus hemionus&quot;) or another ass-like equid that later became extinct, the hydruntine or European wild ass (&quot;Equus hydruntinus&quot;). Onagers were the most common native wild equids of the Near East. They were hunted in Syria, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Iran, and Central Asia; and domesticated asses (&quot;Equus asinus&quot;) were imported into Mesopotamia, probably from Egypt, but wild horses apparently did not live there.

====Other evidence of geographic expansion====

In Northern Caucasus, the Maikop culture settlements and burials of c. 3300 BC contain both horse bones and images of horses. A frieze of nineteen horses painted in black and red colours is found in one of the Maikop graves. The widespread appearance of horse bones and images in Maikop sites suggest to some observers that horseback riding began in the Maikop period.

Later, images of horses, identified by their short ears, flowing manes, and tails that bushed out at the dock, began to appear in artistic media in Mesopotamia during the Akkadian period, 2300–2100 BCE. The word for &quot;horse&quot;, literally translated as &quot;ass of the mountains,&quot; first appeared in Sumerian documents during the Third dynasty of Ur, about 2100–2000 BCE. The kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur apparently fed horses to lions for royal entertainment, perhaps indicating that horses were still regarded as more exotic than useful, but King Shulgi, about 2050 BCE, compared himself to &quot;a horse of the highway that swishes its tail&quot;, and one image from his reign showed a man apparently riding a horse at full gallop. Horses were imported into Mesopotamia and the lowland Near East in larger numbers after 2000 BCE in connection with the beginning of chariot warfare, replacing the long-established kunga (a hybrid between the now-extinct Syrian wild ass and a domestic donkey) as the main equid for warfare.
A further expansion, into the lowland Near East and northwestern China, also happened around 2000 BCE. Although &quot;Equus&quot; bones of uncertain species are found in some Late Neolithic sites in China dated before 2000 BCE, &quot;Equus caballus&quot; or &quot;Equus ferus&quot; bones first appeared in multiple sites and in significant numbers in sites of the Qijia and Siba cultures, 2000–1600 BCE, in Gansu and the northwestern provinces of China. Skeletal evidence from sites in Shirenzigou and Xigou in eastern Xinjiang indicate that by the fourth century BCE both horseback riding and mounted archery were practiced along China’s northwest frontier.

In 2008, archaeologists announced the discovery of rock art in Somalia&#x27;s northern Dhambalin region, which the researchers suggest is one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the Ethiopian-Arabian style, dated to 1000 to 3000 BCE.

===Horse images as symbols of power===
About 4200-4000 BCE, more than 500 years before the geographic expansion evidenced by the presence of horse bones, new kinds of graves, named after a grave at Suvorovo, appeared north of the Danube delta in the coastal steppes of Ukraine near Izmail. Suvorovo graves were similar to and probably derived from earlier funeral traditions in the steppes around the Dnieper River. Some Suvorovo graves contained polished stone mace-heads shaped like horse heads and horse tooth beads. Earlier steppe graves also had contained polished stone mace-heads, some of them carved in the shape of animal heads. Settlements in the steppes contemporary with Suvorovo, such as Sredni Stog II and Dereivka on the Dnieper River, contained 12–52% horse bones.

When Suvorovo graves appeared in the Danube delta grasslands, horse-head maces also appeared in some of the indigenous farming towns of the Trypillia and Gumelnitsa cultures in present-day Romania and Moldova, near the Suvorovo graves. These agricultural cultures had not previously used polished-stone maces, and horse bones were rare or absent in their settlement sites. Probably their horse-head maces came from the Suvorovo immigrants. The Suvorovo people in turn acquired many copper ornaments from the Trypillia and Gumelnitsa towns. After this episode of contact and trade, but still during the period 4200–4000 BCE, about 600 agricultural towns in the Balkans and the lower Danube valley, some of which had been occupied for 2000 years, were abandoned. Copper mining ceased in the Balkan copper mines, and the cultural traditions associated with the agricultural towns were terminated in the Balkans and the lower Danube valley. This collapse of &quot;Old Europe&quot; has been attributed to the immigration of mounted Indo-European warriors. The collapse could have been caused by intensified warfare, for which there is some evidence; and warfare could have been worsened by mounted raiding; and the horse-head maces have been interpreted as indicating the introduction of domesticated horses and riding just before the collapse.

However, mounted raiding is just one possible explanation for this complex event. Environmental deterioration, ecological degradation from millennia of farming, and the exhaustion of easily mined oxide copper ores also are cited as causal factors.

===Artifacts===
Perforated antler objects discovered at Derievka (mistakenly, Dereivka) and other sites contemporary with Suvorovo have been identified as cheekpieces or &quot;psalia&quot; for horse bits. This identification is no longer widely accepted, as the objects in question have not been found associated with horse bones, and could have had a variety of other functions. However, through studies of microscopic wear, it has been established that many of the bone tools at Botai were used to smooth rawhide thongs, and rawhide thongs might have been used to manufacture of rawhide cords and ropes, useful for horse tack. Similar bone thong-smoothers are known from many other steppe settlements, but it cannot be known how the thongs were used. The oldest artifacts clearly identified as horse tack—bits, bridles, cheekpieces, or any other kind of horse gear—are the antler disk-shaped cheekpieces associated with the invention of the chariot, at the Sintashta-Petrovka sites.

===Horses interred in human graves===
The oldest possible archaeological indicator of a changed relationship between horses and humans is the appearance about 4800–4400 BCE of horse bones and carved images of horses in Chalcolithic graves of the early Khvalynsk culture and the Samara culture in the middle Volga region of Russia. At the Khvalynsk cemetery near the town of Khvalynsk, 158 graves of this period were excavated. Of these, 26 graves contained parts of sacrificed domestic animals, and additional sacrifices occurred in ritual deposits on the original ground surface above the graves. Ten graves contained parts of lower horse legs; two of these also contained the bones of domesticated cattle and sheep. At least 52 domesticated sheep or goats, 23 domesticated cattle, and 11 horses were sacrificed at Khvalynsk. The inclusion of horses with cattle and sheep and the exclusion of obviously wild animals together suggest that horses were categorized symbolically with domesticated animals.

At S&#x27;yezzhe, a contemporary cemetery of the Samara culture, parts of two horses were placed above a group of human graves. The pair of horses here was represented by the head and hooves, probably originally attached to hides. The same ritual—using the hide with the head and lower leg bones as a symbol for the whole animal—was used for many domesticated cattle and sheep sacrifices at Khvalynsk. Horse images carved from bone were placed in the above-ground ochre deposit at S’yezzhe and occurred at several other sites of the same period in the middle and lower Volga region. Together these archaeological clues suggest that horses had a symbolic importance in the Khvalynsk and Samara cultures that they had lacked earlier, and that they were associated with humans, domesticated cattle, and domesticated sheep. Thus, the earliest phase in the domestication of the horse might have begun during the period 4800-4400 BCE.

==Methods of domestication==
Equidae died out in the Western Hemisphere at the end of the last glacial period. A question raised is why and how horses avoided this fate on the Eurasian continent. It has been theorized that domestication saved the species. While the environmental conditions for equine survival were somewhat more favorable in Eurasia than in the Americas, the same stressors that led to extinction for the mammoth had an effect upon horse populations. Thus, some time after 8000 BCE, the approximate date of extinction in the Americas, humans in Eurasia may have begun to keep horses as a livestock food source, and by keeping them in captivity, may have helped to preserve the species. Horses also fit the six core criteria for livestock domestication, and thus, it could be argued, &quot;chose&quot; to live in close proximity to humans.

One model of horse domestication starts with individual foals being kept as pets while the adult horses were slaughtered for meat. Foals are relatively small and easy to handle. Horses behave as herd animals and need companionship to thrive. Both historic and modern data shows that foals can and will bond to humans and other domestic animals to meet their social needs. Thus domestication may have started with young horses being repeatedly made into pets over time, preceding the great discovery that these pets could be ridden or otherwise put to work.

However, there is disagreement over the definition of the term &quot;domestication&quot;. One interpretation of &quot;domestication&quot; is that it must include physiological changes associated with being selectively bred in captivity, and not merely &quot;tamed.&quot; It has been noted that traditional peoples worldwide (both hunter-gatherers and horticulturists) routinely tame individuals from wild species, typically by hand-rearing infants whose parents have been killed, and these animals are not necessarily &quot;domesticated.&quot; 

On the other hand, some researchers look to examples from historical times to hypothesize how domestication occurred. For example, while Native American cultures captured and rode horses from the 16th century onwards, most tribes did not exert significant control over their breeding, thus their horses developed a genotype and phenotype adapted to the uses and climatological conditions in which they were kept, making them more of a landrace than a planned breed as defined by modern standards, but nonetheless &quot;domesticated&quot;.

==Horses in historic warfare==

While riding may have been practiced during the 4th and 3rd millennia BCE, and the disappearance of &quot;Old European&quot; settlements may be related to attacks by horseback-mounted warriors, the clearest influence by horses on ancient warfare was by pulling chariots, introduced around 2000 BCE.

Horses in the Bronze Age were relatively small by modern standards, which led some theorists to believe the ancient horses were too small to be ridden and so must have been used for driving. Herodotus&#x27; description of the Sigynnae, a steppe people who bred horses too small to ride but extremely efficient at drawing chariots, illustrates this stage. However, as horses remained generally smaller than modern equines well into the Middle Ages, this theory is highly questionable.

The Iron Age in Mesopotamia saw the rise of mounted cavalry as a tool of war, as evidenced by the notable successes of mounted archer tactics used by various invading eurasian nomads such as the Parthians. Over time, the chariot gradually became obsolete.

The horse of the Iron Age was still relatively small, perhaps high (measured at the withers.) This was shorter overall than the average height of modern riding horses, which range from about . However, small horses were used successfully as light cavalry for many centuries. For example, Fell ponies, believed to be descended from Roman cavalry horses, are comfortably able to carry fully grown adults (although with rather limited ground clearance) at an average height of Likewise, the Arabian horse is noted for a short back and dense bone, and the successes of the Muslims against the heavy mounted knights of Europe demonstrated that a horse standing can easily carry a full-grown human adult into battle.

Mounted warriors such as the Scythians, Huns and Vandals of late Roman antiquity, the Turks and Mongols who invaded eastern Europe in the 7th century through 14th centuries CE, the Arab warriors of the 7th through 14th centuries CE, and the Native Americans in the 16th through 19th centuries each demonstrated effective forms of light cavalry.

<doc id="53544" wikidata="Q444340" url="?curid=53544" title="Crab canon">
<text>A crab canon (also known by the Latin form of the name, &quot;canon cancrizans&quot;; as well as &quot;retrograde canon&quot;, &quot;canon per recte et retro&quot; or &quot;canon per rectus et inversus&quot;) is an arrangement of two musical lines that are complementary and backward. If the two lines were placed next to each other (as opposed to stacked), the lines would form something conceptually similar to a palindrome. The name &#x27;crab&#x27; refers to the fact that crabs are known to walk backward (although they can also walk forward and sideways). It originally referred to a kind of canon in which one line is played backward (e.g. FABACEAE played simultaneously with EAECABAF). An example is found in J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Musical Offering&quot;, which also contains a table canon (&quot;Quaerendo invenietis&quot;), which combines retrogression with inversion by having one player turn the music upside down.

<text>The University of Idaho (U of I, or UIdaho) is a public land-grant research university in Moscow, Idaho, United States. Established in 1889, it was the state&#x27;s sole university for 71 years, until 1963. 

University of Idaho comprises 10 undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools, including University of Idaho College of Law, Lionel Hampton School of Music, JA Albertson College of Business and Economics, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, College of Art and Architecture, College of Education, Health and Human Sciences, College of Engineering, College of Graduate Studies, College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences, College of Natural Resources, and College of Science. It enrolls approximately 12,000 students across its campuses, with 11,000 on the Moscow campus. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

The school is home to the Idaho Vandals, who compete in NCAA Division I athletics. In addition to the main campus in Moscow, the U of I has branch campuses in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Boise, and Idaho Falls. It also operates a research park in Post Falls, and dozens of extension offices statewide.

==History==

On January 30, 1889, Governor Edward Stevenson of the Idaho Territory signed the territorial legislature&#x27;s Council Bill No. 20, which officially established the UI as the upcoming state&#x27;s land-grant institution. Nearly four years later, the university opened for classes on October 3, 1892.
The choice of location for the University of Idaho was an &quot;Olive Branch of Peace&quot; by Gov. Stevenson for his actions in styming the nearly successful effort to detach the north Idaho Panhandle and join the state of Washington.

Formed by the Idaho Territory legislature in 1889, the university opened its doors in 1892 with a class of 40 students. The first graduating class in 1896 consisted of two men and two women.

In 2023, the University of Idaho established a non-profit organization, Four Three Education, which would acquire the University of Phoenix by issuing $550 million in bonds (creating an estimated $685 million in debt). Idaho spent approximately $7 million on consultants prior to the deal. Three University of Idaho administrators sit on the Four Three board, including UI attorney Kent Nelson. The slate of directors of Four Three Education will be selected by the Regents of the University of Idaho. However, President Green and University of Phoenix President Chris Lynne will be &quot;ex-officio members with full voting rights.&quot;

==Campus==

According to the U of I Facts Books, the Moscow campus, abutting the Washington state line, is , including 253 buildings with a replacement value of $812 million. It has of parking lots, of bike paths, 22 computer labs, an 18-hole golf course on , of arboreta, and of farms.

===Administration Building===
The Administration Building, with its clock tower and Collegiate Gothic-style structure, was built from 1907 to 1909 and has become an icon of the university. The building holds classrooms, an auditorium, and administrative offices, including the offices of the President and Provost. Multiple expansions were made, with the north wing added in 1912, the eastern portion of the south wing in 1916 (extended west in 1936 for the library), and the functional annex in 1950, incorporated into the Albertson addition of 2002. The U of I library was housed in the Administration building until 1957, when the Library building opened, constructed on the former site of tennis courts. The College of Law occupied the south wing until its building (Menard) opened in 1973.

The original Administration building, with a single tall spire reaching to , was constructed through the decade of the 1890s and ultimately finished in 1899. It burned in 1906. In the meantime, classes were held at various sites in Moscow. The new Administration building was designed by John E. Tourtellotte, who modeled the new structure after Hampton Court Palace in England.

The 1909 Administration building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Two years out of office, former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt spoke outside the main east entrance of the new building on April 9, 1911, on a platform built of Palouse wheat.

===Hello Walk===
&quot;Hello Walk&quot; is one of the best-known and traveled pathways on the Idaho campus. It includes monuments such as Presidential Grove, where historical figures, such as Teddy Roosevelt, planted trees; the Spanish–American War memorial statue who had his hands cut off but was reconstructed by the handless sculptor Bud Washburn; and Administration Lawn that was designed by the Olmsted Brothers.

===Idaho Student Union Building===
The Idaho Student Union Building, (ISUB) completed in 2000 as the Commons, is the heart of campus and contains a food court, copy center, bagel and coffee shop (Einstein&#x27;s Bagels), Credit Union, and convenience store. Additionally, there is study space, wireless internet, laptop checkout, and many student services such as the offices of the Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI), Academics Assistance, the University of Idaho Writing Center, and Student Support.

With the completion of the Teaching and Learning Center (TLC) at the beginning of the fall semester of 2005, the second phase, the Idaho Student Union Building gained classrooms and completed the vision of a common area where students could learn, study, relax, and get university services all in one place.

===Bruce M. Pitman Center===
The Bruce M. Pitman Center is located on the east end of campus on Deakin Street. The building houses the university&#x27;s financial aid, admissions, new student services, registrar and Graduate &amp; Professional Student Association (GPSA) offices. For students, the Pitman Center also features meeting rooms, a computer lab, wireless access, borrowable laptops and a movie theater. The building began as a motel, the Blue Bucket Inn, which UI purchased in 1936 and later expanded. The VandalStore, built in 1989 on a former parking lot, is located directly across the street to the east; it was previously adjacent to the south.

UI student-run media offices are also present on the third floor of the Pitman Center: The Argonaut, a newspaper; KUOI-FM, a radio station; student media advertising; and Blot, a magazine.

In October 2014, the University of Idaho announced the renaming of the Student Union Building as Bruce M. Pitman Center in honor of the retiring dean of students and vice provost for student affairs, who had served the campus community for more than 41 years. The name change took effect on January 1, 2015.

===ASUI-Kibbie Activity Center===

UI&#x27;s multi-purpose &quot;Kibbie Dome&quot; is the primary home to Vandal athletics; it is the venue for football, soccer, tennis, and indoor track &amp; field. Its Trus-Dek roof system, constructed in 1975, uses natural wood arches to span at a height of over the field&#x27;s hashmarks. Previously on this site was Neale Stadium, which opened in 1937 as an earthen horseshoe with wooden sideline grandstands.

Tartan Turf, similar to AstroTurf, was installed in 1972 with the roll-up mechanism; the arched roof and vertical end walls were completed in time for the 1975 home opener on September 27, enclosing the stadium to become the Kibbie Dome. The seating capacity is 16,000 for football games, 7,000 for basketball games (in a configuration known as the &quot;Cowan Spectrum&quot; since 2001), and 7,500 for concerts.

=== Idaho Central Credit Union Arena ===
Idaho Central Credit Union Arena (ICCU Arena), located immediately to the north of the Kibbie Dome, became the new home of Vandals men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball for the 2021–22 season. The university had attempted to build a new arena to replace Memorial Gym for over 50 years, but nothing came of the plans until 2018, when a $10 million naming gift from Idaho Central Credit Union encouraged the administration to go forward with construction. Ground was broken the following year. The 4,200-seat facility, costing about $51 million, is primarily made from engineered wood, with the superstructure consisting mainly of over 850 Douglas fir beams prepared from trees logged at the university&#x27;s experimental forest. Several major forest products companies assisted in the construction process. The arena opened for a media tour on September 29, 2021, with the basketball teams using the main arena and an included practice court during preseason practice. The first event in the new arena was a men&#x27;s basketball exhibition against NAIA member Evergreen State on October 29. The first regular-season game was a men&#x27;s game against Long Beach State on November 10. This game served as a homecoming for Beach head coach Dan Monson, son of former longtime Vandals head coach Don Monson and himself a former Vandals football player.

===Golf course===
The UI Golf Course was established in 1933 on the southwest edge of campus and opened as nine holes in 1937. It was expanded to 18 holes in 1970 and its current clubhouse was built in 1969. Due to its demanding rolling terrain and southwesterly summer winds, the par-72 course&#x27;s moderate length of from the back tees yields a challenging slope of 135 with a scratch rating of 72.4.

===Arboretum and botanical garden===

Referred to as &quot;Tree City&quot; or &quot;The Arb&quot; by U of I students, the University of Idaho Arboretum and Botanical Garden is a site adjacent to the golf course which features display gardens, ponds, and a variety of trees and plants from Asia, Europe, and North America.

The original Shattuck Arboretum was conceived in 1910 by Charles H. Shattuck, the head of the forestry department. His efforts gradually turned a treeless slope southwest of the Administration Building into a dense forest grove. The arboretum was named for Shattuck in 1933, two years after his death. Until the late 1960s, this area provided the background for left &amp; center field of the MacLean field, whose infield was displaced by the construction of the new College of Education buildings, which were completed in 1968.

The newer portion of the arboretum complex is south of the Shattuck area, in the valley below the president&#x27;s residence (1967), along the eastern edge of the University of Idaho Golf Course.

===Library===
The U of I Library is the state&#x27;s largest library, with more than 1.4 million books, periodicals, government documents, maps, videorecordings, and special collections. The Library&#x27;s Special Collections and Archives houses a collection of first edition works by Sir Walter Scott, as well as more than 1200 texts by and about the author. The Library also has materials by many famous Idahoans, including Ezra Pound, Vardis Fisher, Frank Bruce Robinson, and Carol Ryrie Brink of Moscow. Digitized historic photographs from the University of Idaho campus and the state of Idaho, yearbooks, and the student newspaper the Argonaut, can be found on the Library&#x27;s Digital Initiatives website.

Directly north of the Memorial Gymnasium and built on the former site of tennis courts, the library opened in 1957, relocating from the south wing of the Administration Building. The U of I post office station was formerly housed in its lower northwest corner; it was moved to the new U of I bookstore in 1990. The U of I Library was expanded by 50% in 1993 and rededicated in 1994. The first floor underwent major renovation during the 2016 academic year to up-date collaborative spaces and technology.

===Memorial Gymnasium===
The Tudor Gothic-style Memorial Gymnasium is another U of I icon, known for its whimsical athletic gargoyles perched along the brick building&#x27;s ledges. The multi-purpose &quot;Mem Gym&quot; has a modest seating capacity of only 1,500. Opened in 1928 to honor the Idaho citizens who died in World War I (1917–18) and Spanish–American War (1898), the heavily buttressed structure was designed by the chairman of the university&#x27;s architecture department, David C. Lang.

Memorial Gym was the primary venue for men&#x27;s basketball until January 1976, following the enclosure of the Kibbie Dome the previous fall. The women&#x27;s team hosted its home games in the gym until 2001, when the Cowan Spectrum (inside the Kibbie Dome) was completed. The gym is still in active use today as the home court for the women&#x27;s volleyball team, and was also used for early-season basketball games before the opening of ICCU Arena. It is also used extensively for intramurals and open recreation, as well as for ROTC.

The MacLean baseball field was located directly south of the Memorial Gym, until its infield was displaced by the construction of the College of Education building in 1967. The catcher and batter faced southwest (towards the pitcher&#x27;s mound); the right field line was just south of the gym, running east–west. The background of left and center field was the Shattuck Arboretum. The new baseball field (Guy Wicks Field) was relocated northwest, to the vast intramural fields near the Moscow-Pullman Highway, northwest of the Wallace Complex dormitories. The batter and catcher now faced southeast, toward campus, an unorthodox configuration resulting in a difficult sun field for the left side of the defense (the recommended alignment is east-northeast). Due to budget constraints, varsity baseball was dropped following the 1980 season, but continued for a while as a club sport. MacLean was also the venue for football until the opening of Neale Stadium in 1937.

The swim center and physical education building (formerly known as the &quot;Women&#x27;s Gym&quot;), which both opened in 1970, are adjacent to the south side of the gym. Before the swim center was opened, the Mem Gym had a narrow swimming pool in its basement.

In 1977, the Memorial Gymnasium was added to the National Register of Historic Places after only 49 years.

===Under the elms===
Rare Camperdown elms line the walkway between the Music building, Nichols Building (home to Family and Consumer Sciences) and Administration Building. These &quot;upside-down&quot; trees have been on campus for over 80 years and are among few of their kind in the Northwest. The weeping branches and knotty trunk are formed by being grafted upwards.

===Steam plant===
Built in 1926, the steam plant provides heat to U of I buildings from a single location. Originally designed to burn coal, then oil, then natural gas, the plant was modified in 1986 to burn waste wood chips left over from local sawmills. The use of wood has significantly reduced the emissions of the plant, as well as cut costs to heat the campus. The plant is shut down twice a year for cleaning and maintenance. As a side benefit of the heat generation, the steam pipes are routed underneath campus walkways and provide clean (and ice free) walkways throughout the north Idaho winter.

===University housing===
The University of Idaho offers various options for on-campus housing, including five residence halls (Wallace Residence Center, Theophilus Tower, McConnell Hall, Living Learning Communities, and North Campus Communities) for students and Apartments (South Hill Apartments, South Hill Vista Apartments, and Elmwood Apartments) for non-traditional students or those who need special accommodations.

Usually apartments are only available to single parents, married couples (with or without children), law students, and students over 21 years old. Theophilus Tower, 3 of the 4 Wallace Residence wings, and one LLC building is only available for first-year students. Students can also live in a Fraternity or Sorority chapter on campus. Summer housing is available but choices are limited.

===Ridenbaugh Hall===
The Board of Regents authorized the construction of Ridenbaugh Hall as the first women&#x27;s dormitory on campus. Completed in 1901 at a cost of $17,000, it is the oldest extant building on campus. It was designed by architect Willis A. Ritchie of Spokane, who also designed the Spokane County Courthouse. The building used stone quarried in Latah County for the exterior walls. It was also used as a space for domestic science classes until 1927 when it became a men&#x27;s dormitory. The building was later used for music practice rooms and currently houses the Art and Architecture gallery.

Ridenbaugh Hall was the first U of I campus structure to be named after a person. The hall was dedicated to &quot;the young women of Idaho&quot; in honor of Mary E. Ridenbaugh (1857–1926) of Boise, who was vice president of the U of I Board of Regents, and served as regent from 1901 to 1907. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

==Academics==
From 1896 through May 2011, the University of Idaho granted 80,233 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 21,734 master&#x27;s degrees, 2,694 doctoral degrees, 240 honorary degrees, 1,164 specialist degrees, and 3,654 law degrees.

The university is organized into ten colleges; two are exclusively for graduate students (Law &amp; Graduate Studies).

In July 2002, the College of Letters &amp; Science was split into two separate colleges: the College of Science and the College of Letters, Arts, and Social Sciences (CLASS). Concurrently, the College of Mines and Earth Resources was discontinued; its programs were split between the College of Engineering and the new College of Science.

The College of Law opened a second campus in Boise in 2010. Initially, the Boise campus only offered third-year classes. It expanded to offer second-year classes in 2014, and as of law students can take their entire three-year curriculum at either location.

===Reputation and rankings===

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks U of I tied for 89th among the nation&#x27;s best public universities and tied for 179th among the best national universities in its 2020 report.

The University of Idaho is included in the 2021 edition of Princeton Review&#x27;s &quot;Best 386 Colleges.&quot; The Princeton Review also ranks U-Idaho as one of the nation&#x27;s top 286 environmentally responsible colleges. The university was named by the Corporation for National and Community Service to the 2010 President&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for exemplary service efforts—more than 3,800 students volunteered more than 150,000 hours to community and service-learning. This was the fifth consecutive year Idaho has earned this highest federal recognition for its commitment to service-learning and civic engagement.

==Student life==
U of I is a rural, residential campus, with four residence hall communities to choose from on campus, as well as 27 housed fraternities and sororities. On-campus residence is currently required for freshmen, and many other upperclassmen choose to live on campus in the Greek system or the residence halls.

Apartments on campus are available for families, married couples, graduate students, law students, and non-traditional students. The &quot;Law Cluster&quot; is a group of apartments reserved for law students, allowing for a community close to campus for law students, facilitating study groups.

===Student organizations===
Many students participate in a wide variety of over 200 clubs and organizations. Clubs range from sports to faith based, and everything in between. Palousafest is a fair that brings clubs and students together, and is a way for students to find out more about how to get involved with extracurricular activities. The fair is usually the weekend just before the fall semester starts. The literary journal Fugue is published at the university.

===Greek life===
The University of Idaho is home to more than two dozen (multicultural) Greek organizations that make up more than 20% of the student population. Over 44% of the students who live on campus are involved in Greek life.

==Athletics==
The Idaho Vandals are the intercollegiate athletic teams representing the University of Idaho. The Vandals compete at the NCAA Division I level as a member of the Big Sky Conference.

The university&#x27;s official colors are silver and gold, honoring the state&#x27;s mining tradition. Because these metallic colors in tandem are not visually complementary for athletic uniforms, black and gold are the prevalent colors for the athletic teams, with an occasional use of silver. When Idaho moved out of the Big Sky to the Big West in 1996, the yellow &quot;Green Bay&quot; gold was changed to metallic &quot;Vegas&quot; gold. Yellow gold and black were the colors used by most of the varsity teams from 1978 to 1996, initiated by first-year head football coach Jerry Davitch&#x27;s new uniforms for 1978.

The Kibbie Dome is the home of the Idaho Vandals for four sports (football, tennis, indoor track and field, soccer). Basketball was played in the venue until the autumn 2021 opening of the adjacent Idaho Central Credit Union Arena.

<text>A [[mnemonic]] link system, sometimes also known as a chain method, is a method of remembering lists that is based on creating an association between the elements of that list. For example, when memorizing the list (dog, envelope, thirteen, yarn, window), one could create a story about a &quot;dog stuck in an envelope, mailed to an unlucky thirteen black cat playing with yarn by the window&quot;. It is argued that the story would be easier to remember than the list itself.

Another method is to actually link each element of the list with a mental picture of an image that includes two elements in the list that are next to each other. This would form an open doubly linked list which could be traversed at will, backwards or forwards. For example, in the last list one could imagine their dog inside of a giant envelope, then a black cat eating an envelope. The same logic would be used with the rest of the items. The observation that absurd images are easier to remember is known as the Von Restorff effect, although the success of this effect was refuted by several studies (Hock et al. 1978; Einstein 1987), which found that the established connection between the two words is more important than the image&#x27;s absurdity.

In order to access a certain element of the list, one needs to recite the list step by step, much in the same vein as a linked list, in order to get the element from the system.

There are three limitations to the link system. The first is that there is no numerical order imposed when memorizing, hence the practitioner cannot immediately determine the numerical position of an item; this can be solved by bundling numerical markers at set points in the chain or using the peg system instead. The second is that if any of the items is forgotten, the entire list may be in jeopardy. The third is the potential for confusing repeated segments of the list, a common problem when memorizing binary digits. This limitation can be resolved either through bundling or by using either the peg system or the method of loci.

<text>Charadriiformes (, from &quot;Charadrius&quot;, the type genus of family Charadriidae) is a diverse order of small to medium-large birds. It includes about 390 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most charadriiform birds live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), others frequent deserts, and a few are found in dense forest. Members of this group can also collectively be referred to as shorebirds.

==Taxonomy, systematics and evolution==
The order was formerly divided into three suborders:

* The waders (or &quot;Charadrii&quot;): typical shorebirds, most of which feed by probing in the mud or picking items off the surface in both coastal and freshwater environments.
* The gulls and their allies (or &quot;Lari&quot;): these are generally larger species which take fish from the sea. Several gulls and skuas will also take food items from beaches, or rob smaller species, and some have become adapted to inland environments.
* The auks (or &quot;Alcae&quot;) are coastal species which nest on sea cliffs and &quot;fly&quot; underwater to catch fish.

The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy lumps all the Charadriiformes together with other seabirds and birds of prey into a greatly enlarged order Ciconiiformes. However, the resolution of the DNA-DNA hybridization technique used by Sibley &amp; Ahlquist was not sufficient to properly resolve the relationships in this group, and indeed it appears as if the Charadriiformes constitute a single large and very distinctive lineage of modern birds of their own.

The auks, usually considered distinct because of their peculiar morphology, are more likely related to gulls, the &quot;distinctness&quot; being a result of adaptation for diving.

===Families===
The order Charadriiformes contains 3 suborders, 19 families and 391 species.

** Family Stercorariidae – skuas (7 species)
** Family Alcidae – auks (25 species)

===Evolutionary history===

That the Charadriiformes are an ancient group is also borne out by the fossil record. Alongside the Anseriformes, the Charadriiformes are the only other order of modern bird to have an established fossil record within the late Cretaceous, alongside the other dinosaurs. Much of the Neornithes&#x27; fossil record around the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event is made up of bits and pieces of birds which resemble this order. In many, this is probably due to convergent evolution brought about by semiaquatic habits. Specimen VI 9901 (López de Bertodano Formation, Late Cretaceous of Vega Island, Antarctica) is probably a basal charadriiform somewhat reminiscent of a thick-knee. However, more complete remains of undisputed charadriiforms are known only from the mid-Paleogene onwards. Present-day orders emerged around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, roughly 35–30 mya. Basal or unresolved charadriiforms are:
*&quot;Morsoravis&quot; (Late Paleocene/Early Eocene of Jutland, Denmark) - a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;?
*&quot;Jiliniornis&quot; (Huadian Middle Eocene of Huadian, China) - charadriid?
*&quot;Boutersemia&quot; (Early Oligocene of Boutersem, Belgium) - glareolid?
*&quot;Turnipax&quot; (Early Oligocene) - turnicid?
*&quot;Elorius&quot; (Early Miocene Saint-Gérand-le-Puy, France)
*&quot;&quot;Larus&quot; desnoyersii&quot; (Early Miocene of SE France) - larid? stercorarid?
*&quot;&quot;Larus&quot; pristinus&quot; (John Day Early Miocene of Willow Creek, US) - larid?
* Charadriiformes gen. et sp. indet. (Bathans Early/Middle Miocene of Otago, New Zealand) - charadriid? scolopacid?
* Charadriiformes gen. et sp. indet. (Bathans Early/Middle Miocene of Otago, New Zealand) - charadriid? scolopacid?
* Charadriiformes gen. et sp. indet. (Bathans Early/Middle Miocene of Otago, New Zealand) - larid?
*Charadriiformes gen. et sp. indet. (Sajóvölgyi Middle Miocene of Mátraszõlõs, Hungary
*&quot;&quot;Totanus&quot; teruelensis&quot; (Late Miocene of Los Mansuetos, Spain) - scolopacid? larid?

The &quot;transitional shorebirds&quot; (&quot;Graculavidae&quot;) are a generally Mesozoic form taxon formerly believed to constitute the common ancestors of charadriiforms, waterfowl and flamingos. They are now assumed to be mostly basal taxa of the charadriiforms and/or &quot;higher waterbirds&quot;, which probably were two distinct lineages 65 mya already, and few if any are still believed to be related to the well-distinct waterfowl. Taxa formerly considered graculavids are:
*Laornithidae - charadriiform? gruiform?
**&quot;Laornis&quot; (Late Cretaceous?)
*&quot;Graculavidae&quot;
**&quot;Graculavus&quot; (Lance Creek Late Cretaceous - Hornerstown Late Cretaceous/Early Palaeocene) - charadriiform?
**&quot;Palaeotringa&quot; (Hornerstown Late Cretaceous?) - charadriiform?
**&quot;Telmatornis&quot; (Navesink Late Cretaceous?) - charadriiform? gruiform?
**&quot;Scaniornis&quot; - phoenicopteriform?
**&quot;Zhylgaia&quot; - presbyornithid?
**&quot;Dakotornis&quot;
**&quot;Graculavidae&quot; gen. et sp. indet. (Gloucester County, US)

Other wader- or gull-like birds &quot;incertae sedis&quot;, which may or may not be Charadriiformes, are:
* &quot;Ceramornis&quot; (Lance Creek Late Cretaceous)
* &quot;Cimolopteryx&quot; (Lance Creek Late Cretaceous)
* &quot;Palintropus&quot; (Lance Creek Late Cretaceous)
* &quot;Torotix&quot; (Late Cretaceous)
* &quot;Volgavis&quot; (Early Paleocene of Volgograd, Russia)
* &quot;Eupterornis&quot; (Paleocene of France)
* Neornithes incerta sedis (Late Paleocene/Early Eocene of Ouled Abdoun Basin, Morocco)
* &quot;Fluviatitavis&quot; (Early Eocene of Silveirinha, Portugal)

==Evolution of parental care in Charadriiformes==

Shorebirds pursue a larger diversity of parental care strategies than do most other avian orders. They therefore present an attractive set of examples to support the understanding of the evolution of parental care in avians generally. The ancestral avian most likely had a female parental care system. The shorebird ancestor specifically evolved from a bi-parental care system, yet the species within the clade Scolopacidae evolved from a male parental care system. These transitions might have occurred for several reasons. Brooding density is correlated with male parental care. Male care systems in birds are shown to have a very low breeding density while female care systems in birds have a high breeding density. (Owens 2005). Certain rates of male and female mortality, male and female egg maturation rate, and egg death rate have been associated with particular systems as well. It has also been shown that sex role reversal is motivated by the male-biased adult sex ratio. The reason for such diversity in shorebirds, compared to other birds, has yet to be understood.

<text>Somerville College, a constituent college of the University of Oxford in England, was founded in 1879 as Somerville Hall, one of its first two women&#x27;s colleges. Among its alumnae have been Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Dorothy Hodgkin, Iris Murdoch, Philippa Foot, Vera Brittain and Dorothy L. Sayers. It began admitting men in 1994. Its library is one of Oxford&#x27;s largest college libraries. The college&#x27;s liberal tone derives from its founding by social liberals, as Oxford&#x27;s first non-denominational college for women, unlike the Anglican Lady Margaret Hall, the other to open that year. In 1964, it was among the first to cease locking up at night to stop students staying out late. No gowns are worn at formal halls.

In 2021 it was recognised as a sanctuary campus by City of Sanctuary UK. It is one of three colleges to offer undergraduates on-site lodging throughout their course. It stands near the Science Area, University Parks, Oxford University Press, Jericho, and Green Templeton, St Anne&#x27;s, Keble and St Benet&#x27;s. Over a third of its 650 students are not from the UK. Over half the UK admissions are from state schools – close to the university average. Its total net assets in 2021 were £238 million, the seventh highest of an Oxford undergraduate college. Its sister college at Cambridge is Girton.

==History==
===Founding===
In June 1878, the &quot;Association for the Higher Education of Women&quot; was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, Master of University College, T. H. Green, a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of Balliol College, and Edward Stuart Talbot, Warden of Keble College. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot&#x27;s group (the &quot;Christ Church camp&quot;) founded Lady Margaret Hall, which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.

Thus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college &quot;in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.&quot; This committee was called the &quot;Balliol camp&quot; and had close ties to the Liberal Party. This second committee included A. H. D. Acland, Thomas Hill Green, George William Kitchin, James Legge, Henry Nettleship, Walter Pater, Henry Francis Pelham, its chairman John Percival, Grace Prestwich, Eleanor Smith, A. G. Vernon Harcourt, and Mary Ward. Other people who assisted in the founding were Anna Swanwick, Bertha Johnson, Charlotte Byron Green, and Owen Roberts.
This new effort resulted in the founding of &quot;Somerville Hall&quot;, named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer Mary Somerville. It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody. She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.

Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre was chosen as the first principal because, though not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college&#x27;s political stance. Because of its status as both women&#x27;s college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as &quot;an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s college===
When it opened, Somerville Hall had twelve students, ranging in age between 17 and 36. The first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above a baker&#x27;s shop on Little Clarendon Street. Just two of the original 12 students admitted in 1879 remained in Oxford for three years, the period of residence required for male students to complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

Increasingly, however, as the college admitted more students, it became more formalised. Somerville appointed Lilla Haigh as its first in-house tutor in 1882, and by the end of the 1890s female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges. In 1891 it became the first women&#x27;s hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women&#x27;s halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College), the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build a library. In Oxford legend it soon became known as the &quot;bluestocking college&quot;, its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.

In the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the women&#x27;s suffrage campaign. In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees. From the college&#x27;s inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew. In the same year the college was granted its charter.
===&quot;The Mutual Admiration Society&quot;===
&quot;The (MAS)&quot; was a literary society (or literary circle) of women who became friends at Somerville College. Its members included Dorothy L. Sayers, Muriel St Clare Byrne, Charis Frankenburg, Dorothy Rowe, and Amphilis Throckmorton Middlemore, among others.

The society of the title was a real club. The members composed poetry and prose for each other&#x27;s pleasure. Apart from Sayers, none of them was a household name, though all were notable. Mo Moulton argued in their Agatha Award-winning book, &quot;The Mutual Admiration Society: How Dorothy L. Sayers and Her Oxford Circle Remade the World For Women&quot;, that each one lived a life worthy of attention.

Years later, the writer Vera Brittain — a Somerville contemporary of the group, but not one of its members — recalled that the MAS “took themselves very seriously”.

===First World War===
During the First World War, Somerville College together with the Examination Schools and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the War Office to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to Oriel College. Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent St Mary Hall Quad which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel&#x27;s remaining male students. Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the Western Front in France.

Notable patients who stayed in Somerville include the war poets Robert Graves, Siegfried Sassoon and R. E. Vernède. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon later reminisced about their time at Somerville Hospital: &quot;How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies&#x27; College at Oxford&quot;, Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it &quot;very much like Paradise&quot;. At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie. About his time at Somerville, he wrote: &quot;I enjoyed my stay at Somerville. The sun shone, and the discipline was easy&quot;. Alfred Mills was received in the hospital in 1916 and officer Llewelyn Davies died at the college.

Once the war ended, the return to normality between Oriel and Somerville was delayed, sparking both frustration and an incident in spring 1919 known as the &quot;Oriel raid,&quot; in which male students made a hole in the wall dividing the sexes. In July 1919 the principal (Emily Penrose) and fellows returned to Somerville. Alumna Vera Brittain wrote about the impact of the war in Oxford and paid tribute to the work of the principal, Miss Penrose, in her memoir &quot;Testament of Youth&quot;.

===Admission of men===
Starting in the 1970s, the traditionally all-male colleges in Oxford began to admit female students. Since it was assumed that recruiting from a wider demographic would guarantee better students, there was pressure on single-sex colleges to change their policy to avoid falling down the rankings. All-female colleges, like Somerville, found it increasingly difficult to attract good applicants and fell to the bottom of the intercollegiate academic rankings during the period.

During the 1980s, there was much debate as to whether women&#x27;s colleges should become mixed. Somerville remained a women&#x27;s college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994. Somerville became the second-to-last college (after St Hilda&#x27;s) to become coeducational. A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.

==Buildings and grounds==

The college and its main entrance, the Porters&#x27; Lodge, are located at the southern end of Woodstock Road, with Little Clarendon Street to the south, Walton Street to the west and the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter to the north. The front of the college runs between the Oxford Oratory and the Faculty of Philosophy. Somerville has buildings of various architectural styles, many of which bear the names of former principals of the college, located around one of Oxford&#x27;s biggest quads. Five buildings are Grade II-listed.

A 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by Royalists during the Civil War. There are also remains of some 19th-century buildings, including a stone-lined well.

===Walton House===

The original building of Somerville Hall, Walton House (commonly called House) was built in 1826 and purchased from St John&#x27;s College in 1880 amid fears that the men&#x27;s colleges might, in the future, repossess the site for their own purposes. The house could only accommodate seven of the twelve students who came up to Oxford in the first year. In 1881, Sir Thomas Graham Jackson was commissioned to build a new south wing which could accommodate eleven more students. In 1892, Walter Cave added a north wing and an extra storey. He also installed a gatehouse at the Woodstock Road entrance. In 1897/98, the Eleanor Smith Cottages were added, adjoining Walton House.

Today House is home to only one or two students, and, until 2014, it housed the college bar. It also contains Green Hall, where guests to college are often greeted and in which prospective students are registered and wait for interviews; some of the college&#x27;s paintings by Roger Fry are located here. Most of the administration of college, and the academic pigeon-holes are in House, as is the Mary Somerville Room, a reception room featuring paintings by Mary Somerville, George Romney and George Frederic Watts.

===Park===

Originally known as West, from its location in the college, the idea of building a second self-contained hall was inspired by Newnham College, Cambridge. It was designed by Harry Wilkinson Moore and built in two stages. The 1885–1887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left. It had the effect of turning House and West into rivals. The second building stage (1888–1894) created two sets of tutors&#x27; rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge). In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of Daphne Park, Principal from 1980 to 1989.

Today there are over 60 student and fellows&#x27; rooms in the building along with a music room and a computer room. Park is a Grade II-listed building.

===Library===
The Grade II-listed library designed by Basil Champneys in 1903 was opened by John Morley the following year. Specially for the opening, &quot;Demeter&quot; was written by Robert Bridges and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women&#x27;s colleges of the university. With some foresight it was designed to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it opened. It now holds around 120,000 items (95,000 on open shelves), as one of the largest college libraries in the university.

Amelia Edwards, John Stuart Mill, John Ruskin and Vera Brittain have been notable benefactors to the library. It contains paintings by Mary Somerville, John Constable, Maud Sumner and Patrick George.

The John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill&#x27;s personal library in London at the time of his death, with annotations in many of the books.

The library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle, having been designed to bring the college together, and is open 24 hours, with access to college-wide wifi, a group study room, and computing and printing facilities. It gives full satisfaction according to several annual student surveys.

===Hall and Maitland===
There was no hall large enough to seat the entire college until 1911, when Maitland Hall and Maitland, designed by Edmund Fisher in Queen Anne style and Edwardian Baroque, were opened by H. A. L. Fisher, the Vice-Chancellor of the university and Gilbert Murray. Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to Miss Maitland, Principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and the money was used to pay for oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was designed to frame a portrait of Mary Somerville by John Jackson. The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J. Forester in 1897 and bought from University and Balliol Colleges for £4,000 and £1,400 respectively. There was difficulty in constructing the buildings, now thought to have resulted from the outer limit of the Oxford city fortifications running under the site. In 1935, Morley Horder reconstructed the archway connecting Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating a Reading Room off the main hall; in 1947, André Gide gave a lecture that filled both these rooms and the staircase and quadrangle outside.

Somerville&#x27;s is the one Oxford dining hall where all portraits show women. They were painted by Michael Noakes, Herbert James Gunn, George Percy Jacomb-Hood, William Coldstream, John Whittall, Francis Helps, Claude Rogers, Humphrey Ocean, Thomas Leveritt and Richard Twose.

Hall and Maitland form the east face of the main quad, as Grade II-listed buildings. The Senior Common Room is situated on the ground floor. The first floor holds the pantry and the hall, in which Formal Hall (called guest night) is held weekly in term time.

Maitland now houses few students, being mainly occupied by fellows&#x27; offices and the college IT office. The building, named after Principal Agnes Maitland, stands to the south of Hall.

===Penrose===
The Penrose block was designed by Harold Rogers in 1925 and its first students were installed in 1927. A row of poplars had to be removed in 1926 to construct the south-western end of the main quadrangle on the site of 119 and 119A Walton Street. It was refurbished in 2014, with carpets replacing the bare wooden floorboards, and new furniture. Penrose is named after Dame Emily Penrose, third Principal of the college. It contains mainly first-year accommodation in about 30 rooms.

===Darbishire===

Darbishire Quad was the culmination of a long-standing project to absorb Woodstock Road properties above the Oxford Oratory. In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were bought by the college from the vicar of St Giles&#x27; Church, Oxford for £1,300. The three had been constructed in 1859 and rented by the college before the purchase. The adjoining &quot;Waggon and Horses&quot; pub was purchased from St John&#x27;s College in 1923. These buildings were demolished in 1932–1933 together with the old Gate House.

Morley Horder was commissioned to build a quadrangle that would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of £12,000 from Christ Church. The porters&#x27; lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows. The coat of arms of Somerville and of co-founder John Percival, first Principal Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre and Helen Darbishire were carved by Edmund Ware inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was added in 1938.

Originally the East Quadrangle, it was opened in June 1934 by Lord Halifax as &quot;a notable addition to buildings of varying styles&quot; (&quot;varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile&quot;) in the Creweian Oration during the Encaenia. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, Helen Darbishire.

Today Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors&#x27; offices, the college archive and a medical room. The offices of the Global Ocean Commission, co-chaired by José María Figueres, Trevor Manuel and David Miliband, were housed in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville in 2012–2016, when the organisation completed its work.

Darbishire Quad is described on the opening page of &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; by alumna Dorothy L. Sayers. The clock was donated by alumna Eleanor Rathbone.

===Chapel===
Built largely with funds provided by alumna Emily Georgiana Kemp in 1935, Somerville Chapel reflects the non-denominational principle on which the college was founded in 1879. No religious tests were used for admission and non-denominational Christian prayers were said in college.

Instead of a chaplain, there is a &quot;Chapel Director&quot;, in keeping with its non-denominational tradition. The chapel provides opportunities for Christian worship in addition to hosting speakers with a multiple range of religious perspectives. It holds an excellent mixed-voice Choir of Somerville College, which tours and issues occasional recordings.

===Hostel and Holtby===
Hostel is a small block between House and Darbishire completed in 1950 by Geddes Hyslop. It houses 10 students on three floors. The Bursary is on the ground floor.

Holtby, designed in 1951 and completed in 1956 by Hyslop, lies above the library extension, adjacent to Park. It has ten rooms for undergraduates and is named after the alumna Winifred Holtby.

===Vaughan and Margery Fry &amp; Elizabeth Nuffield House===
Designed by Sir Philip Dowson between 1958 and 1966, Vaughan and Margery Fry &amp; Elizabeth Nuffield House (commonly shortened to Margery Fry) are both named for former principals of the college, while Elizabeth Nuffield was an important proponent of women&#x27;s education and along with her husband Lord Nuffield, a financial benefactor of the college. Margery Fry was opened in 1964 by Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit and Vaughan in 1966. Constructed in the same architectural style, with an exterior concrete frame standing away from the walls of the interior edifice, the two buildings overlie a podium of shops and an arcaded walkway in Little Clarendon Street.

Vaughan is the larger of the two, with eleven rows to its concrete frame compared to eight. It is Grade II-listed and contains some 60 undergraduate rooms, smaller than those of Margery Fry and used exclusively for first-year students, along with the junior deans. Vaughan was refurbished in 2013, with new bathroom facilities, including, for the first time, sinks. Beneath the two buildings, a tunnel provides access to Somerville from Little Clarendon Street.

Margery Fry serves as the centre of the postgraduate student community at Somerville, with 24 graduate rooms. Other accommodation for graduate students is provided in buildings adjacent to the college.

===Wolfson===

Sir Philip Dowson was commissioned to design a building at the back of the college to house undergraduates and offices for fellows and Wolfson. Like his other work in Somerville, it is constructed largely of glass and concrete; it is also Grade II listed. A four-storey building with five bays on each floor, Wolfson has impressive views of Walton Street from the rear and Somerville&#x27;s main quadrangle from the front. Wolfson is named after the building&#x27;s main benefactor, Sir Isaac Wolfson, and was opened in 1967 by Principal Barbara Craig, with Harold Macmillan, Dorothy Hodgkin and Lord Wolfson giving speeches.

The ground floor contains the Flora Anderson Hall (FAH) and Brittain-Williams Room, named after Vera Brittain and Shirley Williams, the college&#x27;s most famous mother-daughter alumnae. The room was designed in 2012 by the architect Niall McLaughlin and opened on 29 November 2013 by Williams at an event that included her unveiling a portrait of herself, which now hangs in the room. The FAH is used for lectures and events, notably college parties (or bops) and mock exams, known as Collections.

===Margaret Thatcher Centre and Dorothy Hodgkin Quadrangle===
Named after the alumna-Prime Minister, the MTC comprises a lecture room, ante room and lobby used for meetings, conferences and other internal college events. The lecture room has full AV facilities and for 60 seated patrons. A bust of Margaret Thatcher stands in the lobby and the meeting room has portraits of Somerville&#x27;s two prime-minister alumnae: of Margaret Thatcher by Michael Noakes and Indira Gandhi by Sanjay Bhattacharyya.

The Dorothy Hodgkin Quad (DHQ) was conceived in 1985, completed in 1991 and named after Somerville&#x27;s Nobel Prize-winner. The quadrangle is above the MTC and designed around self-contained flats of two and four bedrooms with communal kitchens, housing mainly finalists and some second-year students.

Architect Geoffrey Beard&#x27;s scheme was submitted to Oxford City Council in 1986 and the energies of Sir Geoffrey Leigh and alumna and former principal Baroness Daphne Park brought support from around the world. The buildings were opened in 1991 by Margaret Thatcher, Dorothy Hodgkin, Principal Catherine Hughes and College Visitor Baron Roy Jenkins.

===St Paul&#x27;s Nursery===
Somerville College was the first Oxford college to provide a nursery for children of Fellows and staff and is still one of the few colleges to do so. Alumna Dorothy Hodgkin donated much of her Nobel Prize money to the project. St Paul&#x27;s Nursery is also open to families unconnected with the college and cares for 16 children between the ages of three months and five years.

===Radcliffe Observatory Quarter===

ROQ East and West flank the north side of Somerville and overlook the site of the university&#x27;s new Blavatnik School of Government and Mathematical Institute. Completed in 2011, they were the first new buildings in the university&#x27;s Radcliffe Observatory Quarter and have won four awards for their architect Niall McLaughlin. The project was also awarded Oxford City Council&#x27;s David Steel Sustainable Building Award, being commended for balancing Somerville&#x27;s collegiate heritage with the need for energy efficiency. Energy-efficiency measures include renewable technologies such as solar thermal energy and ground source heat pumps.

The buildings house 68 students in en-suite rooms. There are several rooms and facilities designed to help those with disabilities, including lifts and adjoining carer rooms. The buildings were funded by donations of over £2.7 million from over 1,000 alumni and friends of the college and by a significant loan. There is now an unimpeded view of the Radcliffe Observatory.

===The Terrace===
The bar and café of the college, The Terrace, opened in 2013 (replacing the old bar in House) and is attached to the Vaughan building. It is housed in a mainly glass structure, with seating in the college colours of red and black. It has an open-air terrace looking down on Little Clarendon Street. The Terrace has the usual pool table and bar facilities and serves the college drink, &quot;Stone-cold Jane Austen&quot;, consisting of blue VK, Southern Comfort, and Magners cider, as well as the &quot;College Triple&quot; and the non-alcoholic &quot;Somerville Sunset&quot;.

===Catherine Hughes Building===
Named after Somerville&#x27;s late principal in 1989–1996, the Catherine Hughes Building was completed in October 2019 and provides 68 additional bedrooms. Designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects, it includes en suite bathrooms, kitchens and accessible rooms on every floor and a new communal study area for graduate students.

The red-brick building has a frontage onto Walton Street and additional access from the college gardens, aligning with key levels on the adjacent Penrose Building. The bedrooms are arranged in clusters with kitchens and circulation spaces forming social focal points.

The building&#x27;s construction has given Somerville sufficient accommodation to be one of three Oxford colleges which can allow all students applying from 2017 to live in college for the entirety of their three or four-year undergraduate degree courses.

===Gardens===

Somerville is one of few Oxford colleges where students may walk on the grass. An unassuming frontage opens onto a vast green space looked after by two gardeners. The original site consisted of a paddock, an orchard and a vegetable garden and was bounded by large trees. It was home to a donkey, two cows, a pony and a pig. The paddock was soon transformed into tennis courts, where huge tents were erected during World War I. During World War II, large water tanks were dug in the Main Quad and in Darbishire Quad in case of firebombing, and the lawns dug up and planted with vegetables.

In the Main or Library Quad has a cedar planted by Harold Macmillan in 1976, after an earlier cedar fell victim to a winter storm. Another tree, a &quot;Picea likiangensis&quot; (var. &quot;rubescens&quot;), was planted in 2007 on the chapel lawn, providing Somerville with an outdoor Christmas tree. The library border of lavender and &quot;Agapanthus&quot; references the bluestocking reputation of Somerville. The tory blue &quot;Ceratostigma willmottianum&quot; stands outside the Margaret Thatcher Centre. The garden outside the Thatcher Centre, now dedicated to Lisa Minoprio, was originally designed by the former director of the Oxford Botanic Garden and Lecturer in Plant Sciences Timothy Walker, and retains yellow and blue as its theme colours.

There are nods to Somerville&#x27;s long-standing links with India, the most notable being a large specimen of the Indian horse chestnut, &quot;Aesculus indica&quot;, planted on the Library lawn in 2019. Features of interest include a narrow bed of low-growing Mediterranean plants in front of Wolfson in a modernist style, a varied selection of mature trees in the Library Quad, and large herbaceous borders containing emblematic Somerville thistles (&quot;Echinops&quot;).

The annual summer and winter bedding plants in Darbishire Quad, the beds outside the SCR, and those in pots around site have traditionally been in the Victorian style, to reflect the era of inception of the college. However, this is evolving due to a change in garden management in late 2019, with aims of following more environmentally friendly growing principles and developing a more contemporary style. The western wall of Penrose and the northern wall of Vaughan form a secluded area, historically known as the Fellows&#x27; Garden (currently in a transitional phase). It is distinct from the main quad and separated from it by a hedge and a wall, and which were previously kitchen gardens. This walled garden is home to a sundial, commissioned in 1926 and commemorating first principal Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre, and a garden roller gifted by the parents of tutor Rose Sidgwick.

In 1962, Henry Moore lent his work &quot;Falling Warrior&quot; to the college and Barbara Hepworth lent &quot;Core&quot; shortly afterwards. There are also permanent sculptures by Wendy Taylor, Friedrich Werthmann and Somervillian Polly Ionides. The most striking sculpture on site is Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Triad&quot; (1971), situated on the Chapel Lawn in front of Maitland building.

==Student life==

In 2011 student satisfaction was rated in some categories as the highest in the university. Central to it is its large quad, onto which most accommodation blocks back; it is often filled with students in summer. Somerville is one of the few Oxford colleges where students (as opposed to just fellows) may walk on the grass. Somerville is sometimes nicknamed &quot;The Ville&quot;. Formal Halls take place on some Tuesdays and Fridays about six times a term. No gowns are worn and the grace is &quot;Benedictus benedicat&quot;. The college song is &quot;Omnes laetae nunc sodales&quot;.

===Sports===
Somerville has a gym beneath Vaughan with treadmills, cross-trainers and weights. It shares a sports ground with Wadham College and St Hugh&#x27;s College, in Marston Ferry Road. There are clubs and teams in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s football, rugby (with Corpus Christi), mixed lacrosse, cricket, swimming, hockey, netball, basketball, pool, water polo, tennis, squash, badminton, cycling, golf, rounders, and croquet.

Both the Somerville cricket and netball team won Cuppers for the 2014/15 season. The swimming team won Cuppers for the 2015/16 season.

====Rowing====
Somerville formed a rowing team in 1921. It competes in both of the annual university bumps races, Torpids and Summer Eights. The women are the most successful women&#x27;s rowing team at the university, having won the title Head of the River eight times in Summer Eights and five times in Torpids. The club shares the award-winning University College Boathouse on The Isis with St Peter&#x27;s College, University College and Wolfson College.

===Choir===
The Choir of Somerville College is mixed voice and led by the Director of Chapel Music, Will Dawes. In conjunction with the organ scholars, the choir is central to the musical life at the college.

There are regular concerts and cathedral visits, and recitals featuring soloists from the choir. In recent years it has toured Germany (2005 and 2009), Italy (2010) and the United States (2014 and 2016). It sings every term-time Sunday at the evening service. The organ of the college chapel is a traditionally voiced instrument by Harrison &amp; Harrison.

Somerville offers up to eight Choral Exhibitions a year to applicants reading any subject.

The college choir has released two CDs on the Stone Records label, &quot;Requiem Aeternam&quot; (2012) and &quot;Advent Calendar&quot; (2013).

===Triennial Ball===
Once every three years, Somerville hosts a ball jointly with Jesus College, Oxford. The last, for over a thousand people, was held in April 2022 and the next ball will come in 2025.

However, the 2013 ball, &quot;The Last Ball&quot;, was mired in controversy reported in national news. The organisers had intended to display a live nurse shark as entertainment. Permission for the shark was initially granted by the principal Alice Prochaska, but was subsequently revoked following student protests. The ball was widely condemned for poor organisation, examples of which included a lack of canapés and the presence of only one food stand, serving pork; the vegetarian options were said to run out quickly and revellers were reportedly set on fire by the pork rôtisserie. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported &quot;The ball descended into farce with guests questioning what the organisers had done with the money paid by 1,000 guests.&quot;

===Academic reputation===

Before men were admitted Somerville, under the principalship of Barbara Craig, established a position at or near the head of the Norrington Table. Currently Somerville is in the lower half of the university&#x27;s colleges for academic achievement. For the academic year 2018/19, it came 21st out of 30 in the Norrington Table, which lists the university&#x27;s undergraduate colleges in order of their students&#x27; examination performances. The college has been recognised as a University College of Sanctuary by the UK charity City of Sanctuary, and offers a fully-funded postgraduate Sanctuary scholarship.

===&quot;University Challenge&quot;===
Somerville has had recent success disproportionate to its size on the TV quiz show &quot;University Challenge&quot;. It won the competition once, triumphing in the University Challenge 2001–02 series by beating Imperial College, London by 200 points to 185. Croatian quizzer Dorjana Širola was one of the contestants. Recently the college team reached the final of the University Challenge 2013–14 series, losing in the final to Trinity College, Cambridge, with a score of 135 to 240.

==India==
Somerville College plays a major role in relations between Oxford and India. Cornelia Sorabji, born in the Bombay Presidency of British India, became the first Indian woman to study at any British university, when she came to Somerville in 1889 to read law, while Indira Gandhi, India&#x27;s first female prime minister, read Modern History at the college in 1937. Radhabai Subbarayan, the first woman member of the Indian Council of States (Rajya Sabha) studied at Somerville College as well, as did princess Bamba Sutherland, the last surviving member of a family that had ruled the Sikh Empire in the Punjab, and her sister Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh. Other alumni with links to India include Moon Moon Sen, Agnes de Selincourt, Smit Singh, Gurmehar Kaur, Hilda Stewart Reid and Utsa Patnaik. Former principal of Somerville College Barbara Craig from 1967 to 1980 and fellow Aditi Lahiri were born in Kolkata.

Sonia Gandhi visited Somerville in 2002 and presented a portrait of her late mother-in-law to her alma mater. Indira Gandhi received an honorary degree from the college in 1971.

In 2012, the college and Oxford University announced a £19 million &quot;Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development&quot;. India provided £3 million and the university and college £5.5 million. The name was later changed to the &quot;Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development&quot; (OICSD). The OICSD carries out research on sustainable development challenges facing India and provides scholarships for outstanding Indian students. The centre now hosts 12 India scholars. A new building is planned in the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, adjacent to the college&#x27;s ROQ accommodation.

Somerville&#x27;s choir was in 2018 the first Oxford college choir to tour India.

==People associated with Somerville==
===Alumni===

Somervillians include Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and Indira Gandhi, Nobel Prize winning scientist Dorothy Hodgkin, television personalities Esther Rantzen and Susie Dent, reformer Cornelia Sorabji, writers Marjorie Boulton, A. S. Byatt, Vera Brittain, Susan Cooper, Penelope Fitzgerald, Winifred Holtby, Nicole Krauss, Iris Murdoch and Dorothy L. Sayers, politicians Shirley Williams, Thérèse Coffey, Margaret Jay and Sam Gyimah, Princess Bamba Sutherland and her sister, biologist Marian Dawkins, philosophers G. E. M. Anscombe, Patricia Churchland, Philippa Foot and Mary Midgley, psychologist Anne Treisman, archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon, actress Moon Moon Sen, soprano Emma Kirkby, banker Baroness Vadera and numerous (women&#x27;s rights) activists.

Somerville alumnae have achieved an impressive number of &quot;firsts&quot;, both (inter)nationally and at the University of Oxford. Arguably the most prominent of these are: the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher; the first, and only, British woman to win a Nobel Prize in science Dorothy Hodgkin and the first woman to lead the world&#x27;s largest democracy Indira Gandhi, who was Prime Minister of India for much of the 1970s.

Somerville has educated at least 29 Dames, 18 heads of Oxford colleges, 11 life peers, 11 MPs, four Olympic rowers, three of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;, two prime ministers, two princesses, a queen consort, a first lady, and a Nobel laureate.

Former students of Somerville belong to an alumni group, the Somerville Association, which was originally founded in 1888.

===Fellows===
Notable fellows of Somerville College (excluding alumni) include philosopher G. E. M. Anscombe, biochemist Louise Johnson, classical archaeologist Margarete Bieber, Egyptologist Käthe Bosse-Griffiths, classicists Edith Hall and Lotte Labowsky, author Alan Hollinghurst, astronomer Chris Lintott, International Federation of University Women founder Rose Sidgwick, botanist Timothy Walker and philologist Anna Morpurgo Davies.

===Principals===
The first principal of Somerville Hall was Madeleine Shaw-Lefèvre (1879–1889). The first principal of Somerville College was Agnes Catherine Maitland (1889–1906), when in 1894 it became the first of the five women&#x27;s halls to adopt the title of college, the first to appoint its own teaching staff, the first to set an entrance examination, and the first to build a library. She was succeeded by the classical scholar Emily Penrose (1906–1926), who set up in 1903 the &quot;Mary Somerville Research Fellowship&quot; offering women in Oxford opportunities for research.

The current principal is Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, who took up the appointment in August 2017, succeeding Alice Prochaska. To date, seven principals have been alumnae of Somerville, two of St Hilda&#x27;s College.

==Coat of arms and motto==
Like all Oxford colleges, Somerville has a variety of symbols and colours which are associated with it. The college&#x27;s colours, which feature on the college scarf and on the blades of its boats, are red and black. The combination was originally adopted in the 1890s. Its flag has the shield from the arms on a yellow background.

The two colours also feature in the college&#x27;s coat of arms, which depicts three mullets in chevron reversed gules, between six crosses crosslet fitched sable. The college&#x27;s motto, &quot;Donec rursus impleat orbem&quot;, was originally that of the family of Mary Somerville. Her family befriended the new hall, allowing it to adopt their arms and motto. The Latin motto itself is described as &quot;baffling&quot; as, although it translates as &quot;Until It Should Fill the World Again&quot;, what the subject of the sentence (&quot;it&quot;) is left unspecified. The crest, which is often omitted, is a hand grasping a crescent and occasionally a helmet with mantling is added.

<text>The mnemonic peg system, invented by Henry Herdson, is a memory aid that works by creating mental associations between two concrete objects in a one-to-one fashion that will later be applied to to-be-remembered information. Typically this involves linking nouns to numbers and it is common practice to choose a noun that rhymes with the number it is associated with. These will be the pegs of the system. These associations have to be memorized one time and can be applied repeatedly to new information that needs to be memorized.

==Types of peg-word systems==
===Rhyming peg-word system===
The rhyming peg-word system is very simple, as stated above and could look something like this:
# Sun: Visualize an association between the first item and the sun.
# Shoe: Visualize an association between the second item and a shoe.
# Tree: Visualize an association between the third item and a tree.
# Door: Visualize an association between the fourth item and a door.
# Hive: Visualize an association between the fifth item and a bee hive.
# Chicks: Visualize an association between the sixth item and chicks.
# Heaven: Visualize an association between the seventh item and Heaven.
# Weight: Visualize an association between the eighth item and weights.
# Brine: Visualize an association between the ninth item and brine.
# Hen: Visualize an association between the tenth item and a hen.

For example, to remember the first 8 digits of Pi, using the major system as well:

# 3: Picture a monkey walking on the Sun.
# 1: Picture a dog jumping over a shoe.
# 4: Picture a bottle of rum hanging from a tree.
# 1: Picture a tube connecting to a door.
# 5: Picture bees flying from a cup of lemonade as if it is a hive.
# 9: Picture a beetle climbing onto a chick nest.
# 2: Picture a newt with angel wings and a halo.
# 6: Picture a jaguar lifting weights.

The next step is to link the items with some sort of dramatic action, in order to record the order in which they appear.

The less likely you are to have seen the scene in real life, the more likely it is to make a reliably retrievable impression.

===Major system===

While it is common to link rhyming nouns with numbers, that is by no means the only system. There is also the major system, which connects sounds to numbers. The major system is more complicated to learn than simple rhymes or alphabetic pegs, because it associates numbers 0-9 with a specific letter or sound, then larger numbers can combine to create words out of the sounds. It is limitless in the number of pegs it can produce. The most common association between numbers and letters is the following:

*0 = s, x, z
*1 = t, d
*2 = n
*3 = m
*4 = r
*5 = l
*6 = sh, ch, j, soft g
*7 = c, k, hard g, q
*8 = f, v
*9 = p, b

This would make the number 33 &quot;MM&quot; which could be made into the word &quot;mom&quot; to better aid in memorization or 92 is &quot;PN&quot; and could become &quot;pen.&quot; &quot;Cat&quot; (or &quot;cut&quot;) would correspond to 71, as vowels do not have any value.

===PAO system===

The person-action-object (PAO) system is the most complex. It associates all numbers 00-99 with a distinctive person, action and object. Any six-digit number can be memorized by using the person assigned the first two digits, the action of the next two digits and the object of the third. For example:

*The number 34 could be Frank Sinatra.
*13 could be the action of kicking.
*79 could be a cape.

This would make the number 341379, Frank Sinatra kicking a cape. Memory grand master, Ed Cooke, reportedly has been working on the Millennium PAO system, which would create an association for all numbers 000-999.

==Application==
The peg system is commonly used by Mental Athletes for memory competitions for events like card memorization as well as digit memorization. The peg system has also been applied in a classroom with learning disabled students. The students that used the peg system performed significantly better than the control in both immediate and delayed tests.

Several studies have investigated the use of this memory mnemonic as a form of an imagery-based memory system within the process of learning a second-language.  For example, if a native English speaker is attempting to learn Spanish, he will notice that the Spanish for duck is pato, which is pronounced similarly to the English word pot.  The individual can develop a mnemonic peg system in order to remember this association by thinking of a duck with a pot on its head.  

One complaint concerning the peg system is that it seems to only be applicable in mundane situations. However, the peg system can be used to remember grocery lists, key points in speeches, and many other lists specific to one&#x27;s particular area of study or interest. Many recognise that this system can be used to remember a wide variety of objects or information. The peg system works, so long as the information trying to be remembered is specific, able to be visualized, and tied to a unique retrieval cue. This tool of memory can be more efficient than rote memorization.

<text>The Dominic system is a mnemonic system used to remember sequences of digits similar to the mnemonic major system. It was invented and used in competition by eight-time World Memory Champion Dominic O&#x27;Brien.

==Differences from the major system==
The main difference between the Dominic system and the major system is the assignment of sounds and letters to digits. The Dominic system is a letter-based abbreviation system where the &quot;letters&quot; comprise the initials of someone&#x27;s name, while the major system is typically used as a phonetic-based &quot;consonant&quot; system for either objects, animals, persons, or even words. One letter is assigned to each digit; the other sixteen letters of the alphabet are unused.

The major system would assign the &quot;sounds&quot; T + L to the number 15, and then find a word that has those sounds as the first two consonants. Mnemonic images like Tolkien, tiles, or toolbox could be assigned under the major system. In the Dominic system, 15 would be the &quot;letters&quot; A and E, and they would be used as the initials of someone&#x27;s name—for example, Albert Einstein. Albert Einstein would then be given a characteristic action, such as &quot;writing on a blackboard&quot;. Each two-digit number would have an associated person and action.

The Dominic system is specifically designed as a person-action system, while the major system can also be used to represent stand-alone objects. Many mnemonists use the major system as a person-action system as well, so the main difference is the way that images are assigned to the numbers.

Like the mnemonic major system, the Dominic system can be combined with a memory palace, thereby creating the Hotel Dominic.

==Encoding pairs of digits as people==
Using the Dominic system every pair of digits is first associated with a person. O&#x27;Brien feels that stories and images created using people are easier to remember. This encoding is carried out ahead of time and the people are reused, since it can take quite some time.

To perform this encoding, each digit is associated with a letter using the table below. These letters then become the initials of the person representing this number. People will often use quite a loose definition of &quot;initials&quot;, using the initial letters of a phrase describing a person, such as &quot;80 = HO = Santa Claus, laughing and holding his belly (HO, HO, HO!)&quot;.

== Encoding pairs of digits as actions ==

Once each pair of digits has been associated with a person one can then cheaply create a corresponding action for each person. For example, if one had chosen to represent AE as the physicist Albert Einstein one might use a corresponding action of writing on a blackboard.

==Usage==

Once the mappings of a pair of digits are in place a sequence of digits can be converted into a story by first encoding pairs of digits as people or actions and then chaining these people and actions together.

For example, one might remember the number 2739 as follows: First 27 would be encoded BG and then as Bill Gates, then 39 would be encoded as CN and then Chuck Norris. Using the first two digits as a person and the second two as an action, one creates the image of Bill Gates delivering a roundhouse kick. Similarly 3927 might be converted into the image of Chuck Norris writing software.

Longer numbers become stories. The long number 27636339, for example, could be chunked into 2763 6339 and then converted into BGSC SCCN. If the memorizer has also associated Santa Claus delivering presents with SC, then the chunk 2763 would represent Bill Gates delivering presents while 6339 would represent Santa Claus performing a roundhouse kick. The remembered story, therefore, could be that Bill Gates delivered presents and then got roundhouse kicked by Santa Claus.

The Dominic System is typically used along with the method of loci, which allows the easy recall of the images in order by placing them in locations along a mental journey.

===Packs of cards===

Although the Dominic system is a method for remembering long sequences of numbers, it can also be used to remember other sequences such as the order of a deck of playing cards. This works by establishing some method of systematically converting the objects into numbers. If the nine of clubs is associated with 39 (CN), for instance, then Chuck Norris or a roundhouse kick could be used in a story describing where the nine of clubs is in the deck.

<doc id="53560" wikidata="Q21685" url="?curid=53560" title="Procellariiformes">
<text>Procellariiformes is an order of seabirds that comprises four families: the albatrosses, the petrels and shearwaters, and two families of storm petrels. Formerly called Tubinares and still called tubenoses in English, procellariiforms are often referred to collectively as the [[petrel]]s, a term that has been applied to all members of the order, or more commonly all the families except the albatrosses. They are almost exclusively pelagic (feeding in the open ocean), and have a cosmopolitan distribution across the world&#x27;s oceans, with the highest diversity being around New Zealand.

Procellariiforms are colonial, mostly nesting on remote, predator-free islands. The larger species nest on the surface, while most smaller species nest in natural cavities and burrows. They exhibit strong philopatry, returning to their natal colony to breed and returning to the same nesting site over many years. Procellariiforms are monogamous and form long-term pair bonds that are formed over several years and may last for the life of the pair. A single egg is laid per nesting attempt, and usually a single nesting attempt is made per year, although the larger albatrosses may only nest once every two years. Both parents participate in incubation and chick rearing. Incubation times are long compared to other birds, as are fledging periods. Once a chick has fledged there is no further parental care.

Procellariiforms have had a long relationship with humans. They have been important food sources for many people, and continue to be hunted as such in some parts of the world. The albatrosses in particular have been the subject of numerous cultural depictions. Procellariiforms include some of the most endangered bird taxa, with many species threatened with extinction due to introduced predators in their breeding colonies, marine pollution and the danger of fisheries by-catch. Scientists, conservationists, fishermen, and governments around the world are working to reduce the threats posed to them, and these efforts have led to the signing of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, a legally binding international treaty signed in 2001.

==Taxonomy==

The order was named Procellariiformes by German anatomist Max Fürbringer in 1888. The word comes from the Latin word &quot;procella&quot;, which means &quot;a violent wind&quot; or &quot;a storm&quot;, and &quot;-iformes&quot; for &quot;order&quot;. 
Until the beginning of the 20th century, the family Hydrobatidae was named Procellariidae, and the family now called Procellariidae was rendered &quot;Puffinidae.&quot; The order itself was called Tubinares. A major early work on this group is Frederick DuCane Godman&#x27;s &quot;Monograph of the Petrels&quot;, five fascicles, 1907–1910, with figures by John Gerrard Keulemans.

In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the tubenoses were included in a greatly enlarged order &quot;Ciconiiformes&quot;. This taxonomic treatment was almost certainly erroneous, but its assumption of a close evolutionary relationship with other &quot;higher waterbirds&quot; – such as loons (Gaviiformes) and penguins (Sphenisciformes) – appears to be correct. The procellariiforms are most closely related to penguins, having diverged from them about 60 million years ago.

The diving petrels in the genus &quot;Pelecanoides&quot; were formerly placed in their own family Pelecanoididae. When genetic studies found that they were embedded within the family Procellariidae, the two families were merged.

All the storm petrels were once placed in the family Hydrobatidae but genetic data indicated that Hydrobatidae consisted of two deeply divergent clades that were not sister taxa. In 2018 the austral storm petrels were moved to the new family Oceanitidae. The northern storm petrels in the family Hydrobatidae are more closely related to the family Procellariidae than they are to the austral storm petrels in the family Oceanitidae.

Earlier molecular phylogenetic studies found the family Oceantidae containing the austral storm petrels as the most basal with differing branching topologies for other three families. More recent large-scale studies have found a consistent pattern with the albatross family Diomedeidae as the most basal and Hydrobatidae sister to Procellariidae.

There are 147 living species of procellariiform worldwide, and the order is divided into four extant families, with a fifth prehistorically extinct:

* Family Diomedeidae (albatrosses) are very large seabirds with a large strong hooked bill. They have strong legs, enabling them to walk well on land.
* Family Oceanitidae (Austral storm petrels) are among the smallest seabirds, with fluttering flight and long but weak legs. Most have dark upperparts and a white underside.
* Family Hydrobatidae (northern storm petrels) are similar to the austral storm petrels but have longer more pointed wings and most species have forked tails.
* Family Procellariidae (shearwaters, fulmarine petrels, gadfly petrels, and prions) are a varied group of small or medium-sized seabirds, the largest being the giant petrels. They are heavy for their size, with a high wing loading, so they need to fly fast. Most, except the giant petrels, have weak legs and are nearly helpless on land.
* Family †Diomedeoididae (Early Oligocene – Early Miocene) is an extinct group that had narrow beaks and feet with wide, flat phalanges, especially on the fourth toe.

Fossils of a bird similar to a petrel from the Eocene have been found in the London Clay and in Louisiana. Diving petrels occurred in the Miocene, with a species from that family (&quot;Pelecanoides miokuaka&quot;) being described in 2007. The most numerous fossils from the Paleogene are those from the extinct family Diomedeoididae, fossils of which have been found in Central Europe and Iran.

==Biology==
===Distribution and movements===

The procellariiforms have a cosmopolitan distribution across the world&#x27;s oceans and seas, although at the levels of family and genus there are some clear patterns. Antarctic petrels, &quot;Thalassoica antarctica&quot;, have to fly over to get to the ocean from their breeding colonies in Antarctica, and northern fulmars breed on the northeastern tip of Greenland, the northernmost piece of land. The most cosmopolitan family is the Procellariidae, which are found in tropical, temperate and polar zones of both the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres, though the majority do not breed in the tropics, and half the species are restricted to southern temperate and polar regions. The gadfly petrels, &quot;Pterodroma&quot;, have a generally tropical and temperate distribution, whereas the fulmarine petrels are mostly polar with some temperate species. The majority of the fulmarine petrels, along with the prions, are confined to the Southern Hemisphere.

The storm petrels are almost as widespread as the procellariids, and fall into two distinct families; the Oceanitidae have a mostly Southern Hemisphere distribution and the Hydrobatidae are found mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. Amongst the albatrosses the majority of the family is restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, feeding and nesting in cool temperate areas, although one genus, &quot;Phoebastria&quot;, ranges across the north Pacific. The family is absent from the north Atlantic, although fossil records indicate they bred there once. Finally the diving petrels are restricted to the Southern Hemisphere.

====Migration====

The various species within the order have a variety of migration strategies. Some species undertake regular trans-equatorial migrations, such as the sooty shearwater which annually migrates from its breeding grounds in New Zealand and Chile to the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of , the second longest measured annual migration of any bird. A number of other petrel species undertake trans-equatorial migrations, including the Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel and the Providence petrel, but no albatrosses cross the equator, as they rely on wind assisted flight. There are other long-distance migrants within the order; Swinhoe&#x27;s storm petrels breed in the western Pacific and migrate to the western Indian Ocean, and Bonin petrels nesting in Hawaii migrate to the coast of Japan during the non-breeding season.

====Navigation====

Many species in the order travel long distances over open water but return to the same nest site each year, raising the question of how they navigate so accurately. The Welsh naturalist Ronald Lockley carried out early research into animal navigation with the Manx shearwaters that nested on the island of Skokholm. In release experiments, a Manx shearwater flew from Boston to Skokholm, a distance of in 12 days.
Lockley showed that when released &quot;under a clear sky&quot; with sun or stars visible, the shearwaters oriented themselves and then &quot;flew off in a direct line for Skokholm&quot;, making the journey so rapidly that they must have flown almost in a straight line. But if the sky was overcast at the time of release, the shearwaters flew around in circles &quot;as if lost&quot; and returned slowly or not at all, implying that they navigated using astronomical cues.

Researchers have also begun investigating olfaction&#x27;s role in procellariiform navigation. In a study where Cory&#x27;s shearwaters were rendered anosmic with zinc sulphate, a compound which kills the surface layer of the olfactory epithelium, and released hundreds of kilometers away from their home colony at night, control birds found their way to their home nests before night was over, whereas anosmic birds did not home until the next day. A similar study that released Cory&#x27;s shearwaters 800 km from their home nests, testing both magnetic and olfactory disturbances’ effects on navigation, found that anosmic birds took longer to home than magnetically disturbed or control birds.

===Morphology and flight===

Procellariiforms range in size from the very large wandering albatross, at and a wingspan, to tiny birds like the least storm petrel, at with a wingspan, and the smallest of the prions, the fairy prion, with a wingspan of . Their nostrils are enclosed in one or two tubes on their straight deeply-grooved bills with hooked tips. The beaks are made up of several plates. Their wings are long and narrow; the feet are webbed, and the hind toe is undeveloped or non-existent; their adult plumage is predominantly black, white, and grey.

The order has a few unifying characteristics, starting with their tubular nasal passage which is used for olfaction. Procellariiformes that nest in burrows have a strong sense of smell, being able to detect dimethyl sulfide released from plankton in the ocean. This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate their nests within nesting colonies. In contrast, surface nesting Procellariiformes have increased vision, having six times better spatial resolution than those that nest in burrows. The structure of the bill, which contains seven to nine distinct horny plates, is another unifying feature, although there are differences within the order. Petrels have a plate called the maxillary unguis that forms a hook on the maxilla. The smaller members of the order have a comb-like mandible, made by the tomial plate, for plankton feeding. Most members of the order are unable to walk well on land, and many species visit their remote breeding islands only at night. The exceptions are the huge albatrosses, several of the gadfly petrels and shearwaters and the fulmar-petrels. The latter can disable even large predatory birds with their obnoxious stomach oil, which they can project some distance. This stomach oil, stored in the proventriculus, is a digestive residue created in the foregut of all tubenoses except the diving petrels, and is used mainly for storage of energy-rich food during their long flights. The oil is also fed to their young, as well as being used for defense.
Procellariiforms drink seawater, so they have to excrete excess salt. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland at the base of the bill, above the eyes, and in the Procellariiformes the gland is active. In general terms, the salt gland removes salt from the system and forms a 5 percent saline solution that drips out of the nostrils, or is forcibly ejected in some petrels. The processes behind this involve high levels of sodium ion reabsorption into the blood plasma within the kidneys, and secretion of sodium chloride via the salt glands using less water than was absorbed, which essentially generates salt-free water for other physiological uses. This high efficiency of sodium ion absorption is attributed to mammalian-type nephrons.

Most albatrosses and procellariids use two techniques to minimise exertion while flying, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. The albatrosses and giant petrels share a morphological adaptation to aid in flight, a sheet of tendon which locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept up and out without any muscle effort. Amongst the Oceanitinae storm-petrels there are two unique flight patterns, one being surface pattering. In this they move across the water surface holding and moving their feet on the water&#x27;s surface while holding steady above the water, and remaining stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. A similar flight method is thought to have been used by the extinct petrel family Diomedeoididae. The white-faced storm petrel possesses a unique variation on pattering: holding its wings motionless and at an angle into the wind, it pushes itself off the water&#x27;s surface in a succession of bounding jumps.

===Diet and feeding===
The procellariiforms are for the most part exclusively marine foragers; the only exception to this rule are the two species of giant petrel, which regularly feed on carrion or other seabirds while on land. While some other species of fulmarine and &quot;Procellaria&quot; petrels also take carrion, the diet of most species of albatrosses and petrels is dominated by fish, squid, krill and other marine zooplankton. The importance of these food sources varies from species to species and family to family. For example, of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, the black-footed albatross takes mostly fish, while the Laysan feeds mainly on squid. The albatrosses in general feed on fish, squid and krill. Among the procellariids, the prions concentrate on small crustacea, the fulmarine petrels take fish and krill but little squid, while the &quot;Procellaria&quot; petrels consume mainly squid. The storm petrels take small droplets of oil from the surface of the water, as well as small crustaceans and fish.

Petrels obtain food by snatching prey while swimming on the surface, snatching prey from the wing or diving down under the water to pursue prey. Dipping down from flight is most commonly used by the gadfly petrels and the storm petrels. There have been records of wedge-tailed shearwaters snatching flying fish from the air, but as a rule this technique is rare. Some diving birds may aid diving by beginning with a plunge from the air, but for the most part petrels are active divers and use their wings to move around under the water. The depths achieved by various species were determined in the 1990s and came as a surprise to scientists; short-tailed shearwaters have been recorded diving to and the Light-mantled sooty albatross to .

===Breeding behaviour===
====Breeding colonies====

All procellariiforms are colonial, predominantly breeding on offshore or oceanic islands. The few species that nest on continents do so in inhospitable environments such as dry deserts or on Antarctica. These colonies can vary from the widely spaced colonies of the giant petrels to the dense 3.6 million-strong colonies of Leach&#x27;s storm petrels. For almost all species the need to breed is the only reason that procellariiforms return to land at all. Some of the larger petrels have to nest on windswept locations as they require wind to take off and forage for food. Within the colonies, pairs defend usually small territories (the giant petrels and some albatrosses can have very large territories) which is the small area around either the nest or a burrow. Competition between pairs can be intense, as is competition between species, particularly for burrows. Larger species of petrels will even kill the chicks and even adults of smaller species in disputes over burrows. Burrows and natural crevices are most commonly used by the smaller species; all the storm petrels and diving petrels are cavity nesters, as are many of the procellariids. The fulmarine petrels and some tropical gadfly petrels and shearwaters are surface nesters, as are all the albatrosses.

Procellariiforms show high levels of philopatry, both site fidelity and natal philopatry. Natal philopatry is the tendency of an individual bird to return to its natal colony to breed, often many years after leaving the colony as a chick. This tendency has been shown through ringing studies and mitochondrial DNA studies. Birds ringed as chicks have been recaptured close to their original nests, sometimes extremely close; in the Laysan albatross the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was , and a study of Cory&#x27;s shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. Mitochondrial DNA provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, strongly suggesting philopatry.

The other type of philopatry exhibited is site fidelity, where pairs of birds return to the same nesting site for a number of years. Among the most extreme examples known of this tendency was the fidelity of a ringed northern fulmar that returned to the same nest site for 25 years. The average number of birds returning to the same nest sites is high in all species studied, with around 91 percent for Bulwer&#x27;s petrels, and 85 percent of males and 76 percent of females for Cory&#x27;s shearwaters (after a successful breeding attempt).

====Pair bonds and life history====

Procellariiforms are monogamous breeders and form long-term pair bonds. These pair bonds take several years to develop in some species, particularly with the albatrosses. Once formed, they last for many breeding seasons, in some cases for the life of the pair. Petrel courtship can be elaborate. It reaches its extreme with the albatrosses, where pairs spend many years perfecting and elaborating mating dances. These dances are composed of synchronised performances of various actions such as preening, pointing, calling, bill clacking, staring, and combinations of such behaviours (like the sky-call). Each particular pair will develop their own individual version of the dance. The breeding behaviour of other procellariiforms is less elaborate, although similar bonding behaviours are involved, particularly for surface-nesting species. These can involve synchronised flights, mutual preening and calling. Calls are important for helping birds locate potential mates and distinguishing between species, and may also help individuals assess the quality of potential mates. After pairs have been formed, calls serve to help them reunite; the ability of individuals to recognise their own mate has been demonstrated in several species.

Procellariiforms are K-selected, being long-lived and caring extensively for their few offspring. Breeding is delayed for several years after fledging, sometimes for as long as ten years in the largest species. Once they begin breeding, they make only a single breeding attempt per nesting season; even if the egg is lost early in the season, they seldom re-lay. Much effort is placed into laying a single (proportionally) large egg and raising a single chick. Procellariiforms are long-lived: the longest living albatross known survived for 51 years, but was probably older, and even the tiny storm-petrels are known to have survived for 30 years. Additionally, the oldest living bird is Wisdom, a female Laysan albatross.

====Nesting and chick rearing====

The majority of procellariiforms nest once a year and do so seasonally. Some tropical shearwaters, like the Christmas shearwater, are able to nest on cycles slightly shorter than a year, and the large great albatrosses (genus &quot;Diomedea&quot;) nest in alternate years (if successful). Most temperate and polar species nest over the spring-summer, although some albatrosses and procellariids nest over the winter. In the tropics, some species can be found breeding throughout the year, but most nest in discreet periods. Procellariiforms return to nesting colonies as much as several months before laying, and attend their nest sites regularly before copulation. Prior to laying, females embark on a lengthy pre-laying exodus to build up energy reserves in order to lay the exceptionally large egg. In the stormy petrel, a very small procellariiform, the egg can be 29 percent of the body weight of the female, while in the grey-faced petrel, the female may spend as much as 80 days feeding out at sea after courtship before laying the egg.

When the female returns and lays, incubation is shared between the sexes, with the male taking the first incubation stint and the female returning to sea. The duration of individual stints varies from just a few days to as much as several weeks, during which the incubating bird can lose a considerable amount of weight. The incubation period varies from species to species, around 40 days for the smallest storm-petrels but longer for the largest species; for albatrosses it can span 70 to 80 days, which is the longest incubation period of any bird.
Upon hatching, the chicks are semi-precocial, having open eyes, a dense covering of white or grey down feathers, and the ability to move around the nesting site. After hatching, the incubating adult remains with the chick for a number of days, a period known as the guard phase. In the case of most burrow-nesting species, this is only until the chick is able to thermoregulate, usually two or three days. Diving-petrel chicks take longer to thermoregulate and have a longer guard phase than other burrow nesters. However, surface-nesting species, which have to deal with a greater range of weather and to contend with predators like skuas and frigatebirds, consequently have a longer guard phase (as long as two weeks in procellariids and three weeks in albatrosses).

The chick is fed by both parents. Chicks are fed on fish, squid, krill, and stomach oil. Stomach oil is oil composed of neutral dietary lipids that are the residue created by digestion of the prey items. As an energy source for chicks it has several advantages over undigested prey, its calorific value is around 9.6 kcal per gram, which is only slightly lower than the value for diesel oil. This can be a real advantage for species that range over huge distances to provide food for hungry chicks. The oil is also used in defence. All procellariiforms create stomach oil except the diving-petrels.

The chick fledges between two and nine months after hatching, almost twice as long as a gull of the same body mass. The reasons behind the length of time are associated with the distance from the breeding site to food. First, there are few predators at the nesting colonies, therefore there is no pressure to fledge quickly. Second, the time between feedings is long due to the distance from the nest site that adults forage, thus a chick that had a higher growth rate would stand a better chance of starving to death. The duration between feedings vary among species and during the stages of development. Small feeds are frequent during the guard phase, but afterward become less frequent. However, each feed can deliver a large amount of energy; both sooty shearwater and mottled petrel chicks have been recorded to double their weight in a single night, probably when fed by both parents.

==Relationship with humans==

===Role in culture===

The most important family culturally is the albatrosses, which have been described by one author as &quot;the most legendary of birds&quot;. Albatrosses have featured in poetry in the form of Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s famous 1798 poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, which in turn gave rise to the usage of albatross as metaphor for a burden. More generally, albatrosses were believed to be good omens, and to kill one would bring bad luck. There are few instances of petrels in culture, although there are sailors&#x27; legends regarding the storm petrels, which are considered to warn of oncoming storms. In general, petrels were considered to be &quot;soul birds&quot;, representing the souls of drowned sailors, and it was considered unlucky to touch them.

In the Russian language, many petrel species from the Hydrobatidae and Procellariidae families of the order Procellariiformes are known as &quot;burevestnik&quot;, which literally means &#x27;the announcer of the storm&#x27;. When in 1901, the Russian writer Maxim Gorky turned to the imagery of subantarctic avifauna to describe Russian society&#x27;s attitudes to the coming revolution, he used a &quot;storm-announcing&quot; petrel as the lead character of a poem that soon became popular in the revolutionary circles as &quot;the battle anthem of the revolution&quot;. Although the species called &quot;stormy petrel&quot; in English is not one of those to which the &quot;burevestnik&quot; name is applied in Russian (it, in fact, is known in Russian as an entirely un-romantic &quot;kachurka&quot;), the English translators uniformly used the &quot;stormy petrel&quot; image in their translations of the poem, usually known in English as &quot;The Song of the Stormy Petrel&quot;.

Various tubenose birds are relevant to the mythologies and oral traditions of Polynesia. The Māori used the wing bones of the albatross to carve flutes. In Hawaiian mythology, Laysan albatrosses are considered &quot;aumakua&quot;, being a sacred manifestation of the ancestors, and quite possibly also the sacred bird of Kāne. The storm petrel features prominently in the &quot;Origin of Birds&quot; myth.

===Exploitation===
Albatrosses and petrels have been important food sources for humans for as long as people have been able to reach their remote breeding colonies. Amongst the earliest-known examples of this is the remains of shearwaters and albatrosses along with those of other seabirds in 5,000-year-old middens in Chile, although it is likely that they were exploited prior to this. Since then, many other marine cultures, both subsistence and industrial, have exploited procellariiforms, in some cases almost to extinction. Some cultures continue to harvest shearwaters (a practice known as muttonbirding); for example, the Māori of New Zealand use a sustainable traditional method known as &quot;kaitiakitanga&quot;. In Alaska, residents of Kodiak Island harpoon short-tailed albatrosses, &quot;Diomedea albatrus&quot;, and until the late 1980s residents of Tristan Island in the Indian Ocean harvested the eggs of the Yellow-nosed Mollymawks, &quot;Diomedea chlororhynchos&quot;, and sooty albatrosses, &quot;Phoebetria fusca&quot;. Albatrosses and petrels are also now tourist draws in some locations, such as Taiaroa Head. While such exploitation is non-consumptive, it can have deleterious effects that need careful management to protect both the birds and the tourism.

The English naturalist William Yarrell wrote in 1843 that &quot;ten or twelve years ago, Mr. Gould exhibited twenty-four [storm petrels], in a large dish, at one of the evening meetings of the Zoological Society&quot;.

The engraver Thomas Bewick wrote in 1804 that &quot;Pennant, speaking of those [birds] which breed on, or inhabit, the Isle of St Kilda, says—&#x27;No bird is of so much use to the islanders as this: the Fulmar supplies them with oil for their lamps, down for their beds, a delicacy for their tables, a balm for their wounds, and a medicine for their distempers.&#x27;&quot; A photograph by George Washington Wilson taken about 1886 shows a &quot;view of the men and women of St Kilda on the beach dividing up the catch of Fulmar&quot;. James Fisher, author of &quot;The Fulmar&quot; (1952) calculated that every person on St Kilda consumed over 100 fulmars each year; the meat was their staple food, and they caught around 12,000 birds annually. However, when the human population left St Kilda in 1930, the population did not suddenly grow.

===Threats and conservation===


The albatrosses and petrels are &quot;amongst the most severely threatened taxa worldwide&quot;. They face a variety of threats, the severity of which varies greatly from species to species. Several species are among the most common of seabirds, including Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel (an estimated 12 to 30 million individuals) and the short-tailed shearwater (23 million individuals); while the total population of some other species is a few hundred. There are less than 200 Magenta petrels breeding on the Chatham Islands, only 130 to 160 Zino&#x27;s petrels and only 170 Amsterdam albatrosses. Only one species is thought to have become extinct since 1600, the Guadalupe storm petrel of Mexico, although a number of species had died out before this. Numerous species are very poorly known; for example, the Fiji petrel has rarely been seen since its discovery. The breeding colony of the New Zealand storm petrel was not located until February 2013; it had been thought extinct for 150 years until its rediscovery in 2003, while the Bermuda petrel had been considered extinct for nearly 300 years.
The principal threat to the albatrosses and larger species of procellariids is long-line fishing. Bait set on hooks is attractive to foraging birds and many are hooked by the lines as they are set. As many as 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Before 1991 and the ban on drift-net fisheries, it was estimated that 500,000 seabirds a year died as a result. This has caused steep declines in some species, as procellariiforms are extremely slow breeders and cannot replace their numbers fast enough. Losses of albatrosses and petrels in the Southern Ocean were estimated at between 1 percent and 16 percent per year, which these species cannot sustain for long.

Exotic species introduced to the remote breeding colonies threaten all types of procellariiform. These principally take the form of predators; most albatross and petrel species are clumsy on land and unable to defend themselves from mammals such as rats, feral cats and pigs. This phenomenon, ecological naivete, has resulted in declines in many species and was implicated in the extinction of the Guadalupe storm petrel. Already in 1910 Godman wrote:


Introduced herbivores may unbalance the ecology of islands; introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island off New South Wales, which increased the vulnerability of the Gould&#x27;s petrels nesting on the island to natural predators, and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the native birdlime tree (&quot;Pisonia umbellifera&quot;). In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.

Exploitation has decreased in importance as a threat. Other threats include the ingestion of plastic flotsam. Once swallowed, plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. It can also be picked up by foraging adults and fed to chicks, stunting their development and reducing the chances of successfully fledging. Procellariids are also vulnerable to marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as Barau&#x27;s petrel, Newell&#x27;s shearwater and Cory&#x27;s shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands, are victims of light pollution. Fledging chicks are attracted to streetlights and may then be unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of fledging Barau&#x27;s petrels and 45 to 60 percent of fledging Cory&#x27;s shearwater are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion and Tenerife, respectively.

<doc id="53569" wikidata="Q16345" url="?curid=53569" title="Leonard Nimoy">
<text>Leonard Simon Nimoy ( ; March 26, 1931 – February 27, 2015) was an American actor and director, famed for playing Spock in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise for almost 50 years. This includes originating Spock in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series in 1966, then &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, the first six &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, and &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;. Nimoy also directed films, including &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984), &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986), and &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; (1987), and his career included roles in music videos and video games. In addition to acting and filmmaking, Nimoy was a photographer, author, singer, and songwriter.

Nimoy&#x27;s acting career began during his early twenties, teaching acting classes in Hollywood and making minor film and television appearances throughout the 1950s. From 1953 to 1955, he served in the United States Army as a Staff Sergeant in the Special Services, an entertainment branch of the American military. He originated and developed Spock beginning with the 1964 &quot;Star Trek&quot; television pilot &quot;The Cage&quot; and 1965’s &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, through series&#x27; end in early 1969, followed by eight feature films and guest appearances in spin-offs. From 1967 to 1970, Nimoy had a music career with Dot Records, with his first and second albums mostly as Spock. After the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, Nimoy starred in &quot;&quot; for two seasons, hosted the documentary series &quot;In Search of...&quot;, appeared in &quot;Columbo&quot;, and made several well-received stage appearances.

Nimoy&#x27;s portrayal of Spock made a significant cultural impact and earned him three Emmy Award nominations. His public profile as Spock was so strong that both his autobiographies, &quot;I Am Not Spock&quot; (1975) and &quot;I Am Spock&quot; (1995), were written from the viewpoint of coexistence with the character. Leonard Nimoy played the elder Spock, with Zachary Quinto portraying a younger Spock, in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot film, directed by J. J. Abrams. In 2010, Nimoy announced that he was retiring from playing Spock, citing both his advanced age and the desire to give Quinto full media attention as the character. His final role as Spock was in the 2013 sequel, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;.

Nimoy died in February 2015 after a long case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His death was international news and was met with expressions of shock and grief by fans, &quot;Star Trek&quot; co-stars, scientists, celebrities, and the media. An asteroid was named 4864 Nimoy in his honor. &quot;For the Love of Spock&quot; (2016) was produced by his son Adam about his life and career, and &quot;Remembering Leonard Nimoy&quot; (2017) was produced by his daughter Julie about his illness.

== Early life ==
Leonard Simon Nimoy was born on March 26, 1931, in an Irish section of the West End of Boston, Massachusetts, to Jewish immigrants from Iziaslav, Ukraine. His parents left Iziaslav separately, his father first walking over the border into Poland while his mother and grandmother were smuggled out of the Soviet Union in a horse-drawn wagon by hiding under bales of hay. They reunited after arriving in the United States. His mother, Dora (née Spinner; 1904–1987), was a homemaker, and his father, Max Nimoy (1901–1987), owned a barbershop in the Mattapan section of Boston. He had an elder brother, Melvin (1926–2022).

As a child, Nimoy took miscellaneous jobs to supplement his family&#x27;s income, including selling newspapers and greeting cards, shining shoes, or setting up chairs in theaters, and when he got older, selling vacuum cleaners. He began acting at the age of eight in a children&#x27;s and neighborhood theater. His parents wanted him to attend college and pursue a stable career, or even learn to play the accordion, so he could always make a living, but his grandfather encouraged him to do what he then wanted to do most, which was acting. Nimoy realized he had an aptitude for singing, which he developed in his synagogue&#x27;s choir. His singing during his bar mitzvah at age 13 was so good he was asked to repeat his performance the following week at another synagogue. William Shatner said, &quot;He is still the only man I know whose voice was two bar mitzvahs good!&quot;

His first major role was at 17, as Ralphie in an amateur production of Clifford Odets&#x27;s &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot;, about the struggles of a matriarchal Jewish family similar to his during the Great Depression. He said, &quot;Playing this teenage kid in this Jewish family that was so much like mine was amazing... The same dynamics, the same tensions in the household.&quot; The role &quot;lit a passion&quot; that led to his acting career, saying &quot;I never wanted to do anything else.&quot; Shatner has said that Nimoy also worked on local radio shows for children, often voice acting Bible stories:
Nimoy took drama classes at Boston College, and after moving to Los Angeles, he used $600 he saved from selling vacuum cleaners to enroll at the Pasadena Playhouse, supporting himself by being a theatre usher, taxicab driver and stocking vending machines. However, he was soon disillusioned and quit after six months, feeling that the acting skills he had already acquired from earlier roles were more advanced: &quot;I thought, I have to study here three years in order to do this level of work, and I&#x27;m already doing better work&quot;.

He became a devotee of method acting concepts derived from the teachings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, realizing the stage allowed him to explore his original inspirations for acting: the &quot;psychological, emotional, and physical territories of life that can&#x27;t be done anywhere else&quot;. Like his method actor role model, Marlon Brando, Nimoy wore jeans and T-shirts. Between studies, he took a job at an ice cream parlor on the Sunset Strip.

In 1953, Nimoy enlisted in the United States Army Reserve at Fort McPherson Georgia, serving for 18 months until 1955, leaving as a Staff Sergeant. He had been in the Army Special Services, putting on shows which he wrote, narrated, and emceed. One of his soldiers was Ken Berry, whom he encouraged to go into acting as a civilian and helped contact agents. During that period, he directed and starred in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, with the Atlanta Theater Guild. Soon after he was discharged, his wife Sandi was pregnant with their second child, and they rented an apartment while he became a cab driver in Los Angeles. He once picked up Senator John F. Kennedy at the Bel Air Hotel in 1956, before the Democratic Convention began on August 13. As the Senator was not carrying any cash, Nimoy had to follow him into the Beverly Hilton to collect his $1.25 from someone Kennedy knew. He got a $1.75 tip.

== Acting career ==

=== Before and during &quot;Star Trek&quot; ===

Nimoy spent more than a decade playing only small parts in B movies and the lead in one, along with a minor TV role. He believed his performance as the title role in the 1952 film &quot;Kid Monk Baroni&quot; would make him a star, but the film failed after a brief cinema showing. During his military career, the film gained a larger audience on television, and after his discharge he got steadier work portraying a &quot;heavy&quot;, where his character used street weapons like switchblades and guns or had to threaten or attack people. He overcame his Boston accent, but realized his lean appearance made stardom unlikely.

He decided to be a supporting actor rather than take lead roles, an attitude he acquired from his childhood: &quot;I&#x27;m a second child who was educated to the idea my older brother was to be given respect and not perturbed. I was not to upstage him[...] So my acting career was designed to be a supporting player, a character actor.&quot; He played more than 50 small parts in B movies, television series such as &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;Dragnet&quot;, and serials such as &quot;Zombies of the Stratosphere&quot; (1952), in which he played a Martian named Narab. To support a wife and two children, he often took other work, such as delivering newspapers, working in a pet shop, and driving cabs.

Nimoy played an army sergeant in the 1954 science fiction thriller &quot;Them!&quot; and a professor in the 1958 science fiction movie &quot;The Brain Eaters&quot;, and had a role in &quot;The Balcony&quot; (1963), a film adaptation of the Jean Genet play. With Vic Morrow, he co-produced &quot;Deathwatch&quot;, a 1965 English-language film version of Genet&#x27;s play &quot;Haute Surveillance&quot;, adapted and directed by Morrow and starring Nimoy. The story deals with three prison inmates. Partly as a result of his role, he then taught drama classes to members of Synanon, a drug rehab center, explaining: &quot;Give a little here and it always comes back&quot;.

He had guest roles in the &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; series from 1958 to 1960 and a minor role in the 1961 &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;A Quality of Mercy&quot;. He also appeared in the syndicated &quot;Highway Patrol&quot; starring Broderick Crawford, and as Luke Reid in the &quot;Night of Decision&quot; episode of the ABC/Warner Bros. western series &quot;Colt .45&quot;.

Nimoy appeared four times in ethnic roles on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, the number one rated program of the 1961–1962 season. He portrayed Bernabe Zamora in &quot;The Estaban Zamora Story&quot; (1959), &quot;Cherokee Ned&quot; in &quot;The Maggie Hamilton Story&quot; (1960), Joaquin Delgado in &quot;The Tiburcio Mendez Story&quot; (1961), and Emeterio Vasquez in &quot;The Baylor Crowfoot Story&quot; (1962).

Nimoy appeared in numerous episodes of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, as well as in &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; (1959), &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1960), &quot;The Rebel&quot; (1960), &quot;Two Faces West&quot; (1961), &quot;Laramie&quot; (1961), &quot;Rawhide&quot; (1961), &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1962), &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; (1962), &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (1963), &quot;Combat!&quot; (1963, 1965), &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (1964), &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1963–1965; first working with &quot;Star Trek&quot; co-star DeForest Kelley in &quot;Man of Violence&quot;, episode 14 of season 2, in 1963), and &quot;Get Smart&quot; (1966). He appeared in the 1995 &quot;Outer Limits&quot; series. He appeared on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in 1961 as Grice, in 1962 as Arnie, and in 1966 as John Walking Fox.

Nimoy and later &quot;Star Trek&quot; co-star William Shatner first worked together on an episode of the NBC spy series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;The Project Strigas Affair&quot; (1964). Their characters were from opposite sides of the Iron Curtain, though with his saturnine appearance, Nimoy played the villain and Shatner played a reluctant U.N.C.L.E. recruit. By then he had a good reputation in Hollywood as a character actor, and chose &quot;Star Trek&quot; over a role on &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.

On the stage, Nimoy played the lead role in a short run of Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;Visit to a Small Planet&quot; in 1968 (shortly before the end of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series) at the Pheasant Run Playhouse in St. Charles, Illinois.

=== &quot;Star Trek&quot; ===

Nimoy was best known for his portrayal of Spock, the half-human, half-Vulcan character he played on &quot;Star Trek&quot; from the first TV episode in 1966 to the film &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; in 2013. According to biographer Dennis Fischer, Spock was Nimoy&#x27;s &quot;most important role&quot;. Spock became an icon and one of the most popular alien characters ever featured on television. Viewers admired his composure and intellect and his ability to take on any task successfully. As a result, Nimoy&#x27;s character &quot;took the public by storm&quot;, nearly eclipsing the star of the series, William Shatner&#x27;s Captain Kirk, adds Fischer. Nimoy was later credited for bringing &quot;dignity and intelligence to one of the most revered characters in science fiction&quot;.

Nimoy and Shatner, who portrayed his commanding officer, became close friends during the series&#x27; television run, and were &quot;like brothers&quot;, according to Shatner. &quot;Star Trek&quot; was broadcast from 1966 to 1969. For his role as Spock, Nimoy was nominated three times for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and has long remained the only &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor nominated for an Emmy.

Among Spock&#x27;s recognized and unique symbols Nimoy incorporated into the series is the Vulcan salute, which became identified with him in pop culture. Nimoy created the sign from his childhood memories of the way &quot;kohanim&quot; (Jewish priests) hold their hands when giving the Priestly Blessing. The accompanying spoken blessing is &quot;Live long and prosper&quot;.

Nimoy conceived the &quot;Vulcan nerve pinch&quot;, which he suggested as a replacement for the scripted knock out method of using the butt of his phaser. He wanted a more sophisticated way of rendering a person unconscious. Nimoy explained to the director that Spock had, per the story, attended the Vulcan Institute of Technology and had studied human anatomy. Spock possessed the ability to project a unique form of energy through his fingertips. Nimoy explained the idea of putting his hand on his neck and shoulder to Shatner, and they rehearsed it. Nimoy credits Shatner&#x27;s acting during the &quot;pinch&quot; that sold the idea and made it work on screen.

Nimoy reprised Spock in &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; and two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. When the new series &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot; was planned in the late 1970s, Nimoy was to be in only two of eleven episodes, but when the series was elevated to a feature film, he agreed to reprise his role. The first six &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies feature the original cast including Nimoy, who also directed two of the films, &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; and &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;. He played the elder Spock in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot film and briefly in the 2013 sequel, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, both directed by J. J. Abrams.

=== After &quot;Star Trek&quot; ===

Following &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 1969, Nimoy immediately joined the cast of the spy series &quot;&quot;, which was seeking a replacement for Martin Landau. Nimoy was cast in the role of Paris, an IMF agent who was an ex-magician and make-up expert, &quot;The Great Paris&quot;. He played the role during and from 1969 to 1971. Nimoy had been strongly considered as part of the initial cast for the show, but remained on &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

He co-starred with Yul Brynner and Richard Crenna in the Western movie &quot;Catlow&quot; (1971). He also had roles in two episodes of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot; (1972 and 1973) and &quot;Columbo&quot; (1973). He appeared in television films such as &quot;Assault on the Wayne&quot; (1970), &quot;Baffled!&quot; (1972), &quot;The Alpha Caper&quot; (1973), &quot;The Missing Are Deadly&quot; (1974), &quot;Seizure: The Story Of Kathy Morris&quot; (1980), and &quot;Marco Polo&quot; (1982). He received an Emmy Award nomination for best supporting actor for the television film &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot; (1982), for playing the role of Morris Meyerson, Golda Meir&#x27;s husband, opposite Ingrid Bergman as Golda in her final role.

In 1975, Nimoy filmed an opening introduction to Ripley&#x27;s World of the Unexplained museum located at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf at San Francisco, California. In the late 1970s, he hosted and narrated the television series &quot;In Search of...&quot;, which investigated paranormal or unexplained events or subjects. In 2000–2001 he hosted CNBC TV series &quot;The Next Wave With Leonard Nimoy&quot;, which explored how e-businesses were integrating with technology and the Internet. He also had a character part as a psychiatrist in Philip Kaufman&#x27;s 1978 remake of &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;.
=== Stage ===

Nimoy won acclaim for a series of stage roles. In 1971 he played the starring role of Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, which toured for eight weeks. Having performed in the Yiddish theater as a young man, he said the part was like a &quot;homecoming&quot; for him because his parents, like Tevye, also came from a shtetl in Russia and could relate to the play when they saw him in it. Later that year he starred as Arthur Goldman in &quot;The Man in the Glass Booth&quot; at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego.

He starred as Randle McMurphy in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; in 1974, one year prior to its release as a feature film, with Jack Nicholson in the same role. During the run of the play, Nimoy took over as its director and wanted his character to be &quot;rough and tough,&quot; and insisted on having tattoos. The costumer for the show, Sharon White, was amused: &quot;That was sort of an intimate thing... Here I am with Mr. Spock, for god&#x27;s sakes, and I am painting pictures on his arms.&quot;

In 1975, Nimoy toured with and played the title role in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. A number of authors have perceived parallels between the rational Holmes and the character of Spock, and it became a running theme in &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan clubs. &quot;Star Trek&quot; writer Nicholas Meyer said that &quot;the link between Spock and Holmes was obvious to everyone.&quot; Meyer gives a few examples, including a scene in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,&quot; in which Spock quotes directly from a Doyle book and credits Holmes as a forefather to the logic he was espousing. In addition, the connection was implied in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, which paid homage to both Holmes and Spock.

By 1977, when Nimoy played Martin Dysart in &quot;Equus&quot; on Broadway, he had played 13 important roles in 27 cities, including Tevye, Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and Randle McMurphy in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;. In 1981, Nimoy starred in &quot;Vincent&quot;, a one-man show which he wrote and published as a book in 1984. The audio recording of the play is available on DVD under the title, &quot;Van Gogh Revisited.&quot; It was based on the life of artist Vincent van Gogh, in which Nimoy played Van Gogh&#x27;s brother Theo. Other plays included &quot;Oliver!&quot;, at The Melody Top Theater in Milwaukee, &quot;6 Rms Riv Vu&quot; opposite Sandy Dennis, in Florida, &quot;Full Circle&quot; with Bibi Anderson on Broadway and in Washington, D.C. He was in &quot;Camelot&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Caligula&quot;, &quot;The Four Poster&quot;, and &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot;

=== &quot;Star Trek&quot; films ===
After Paramount agreed to settle a lawsuit by Nimoy for &quot;Star Trek&quot; merchandise royalties, he agreed to join &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, the first in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film series. By 1986, Nimoy had earned more than half a million dollars in royalties.

=== Other roles ===
==== Voice actor ====
In 1975, Nimoy&#x27;s renditions of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; and &quot;Usher II&quot;, both from &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; (1950), were released on Caedmon Records. During 1980, Nimoy hosted the Friday &quot;Adventure Night&quot; segment of the radio drama series &quot;Mutual Radio Theater&quot;, heard via the Mutual Broadcasting System. In 1986, Nimoy lent his voice to the 1986 cartoon movie &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; for the character Galvatron.

In Bradbury&#x27;s 1993 animated TV film &quot;The Halloween Tree&quot;, Nimoy was the voice of Mr.Moundshroud, the children&#x27;s guide. Nimoy lent his voice as narrator to the 1994 IMAX documentary film, &quot;Destiny in Space&quot;, showcasing film-footage of space from nine Space Shuttle missions over four years time. In 1999, he voiced the narration of the English version of the Sega Dreamcast game &quot;Seaman&quot; and promoted Y2K educational films.

Together with John de Lancie, another actor from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, Nimoy created Alien Voices, an audio-production venture that specializes in audio dramatizations. Among the works jointly narrated by the pair are &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, &quot;The Lost World&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot;, and several television specials for the Sci-Fi Channel. In an interview published on the official &quot;Star Trek&quot; website, Nimoy said that Alien Voices was discontinued because the series did not sell well enough to recoup costs.

In 2001, Nimoy voiced the Atlantean King Kashekim Nedakh in the Disney animated feature &quot;&quot;. Nimoy provided a comprehensive series of voice-overs for the 2005 computer game &quot;Civilization IV&quot;. In the television series &quot;The Next Wave&quot; he interviewed people about technology. He hosts the documentary film &quot;The Once and Future Griffith Observatory&quot;. Nimoy and his wife, Susan Bay-Nimoy, were major supporters of the Griffith Observatory&#x27;s historic 2002–2004 expansion.

In 2009, he voiced &quot;The Zarn&quot; in the television-based movie &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;. He voiced the &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; massive multiplayer online game, released in February 2010, and &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot; as Xehanort, the series&#x27; leading villain. Tetsuya Nomura, the director of &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot;, said Nimoy was chosen for the role specifically because of his role as Spock, to play opposite Mark Hamill, famous for his role as Luke Skywalker in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, as Nomura was a fan of both series and wanted to pit them against each other. Nimoy reprised this role for &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot; in 2012. After his death in 2015, Nimoy was replaced for the role as Xehanort by Rutger Hauer, who died and was succeeded by Nimoy&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; co-star Christopher Lloyd.

Nimoy voiced Sentinel Prime in the 2011 film &quot;&quot;. He was a frequent and popular reader for &quot;Selected Shorts&quot;, an ongoing series of programs at Symphony Space in New York City (that also tours around the country) which features actors, and sometimes authors, reading works of short fiction. The programs are broadcast on radio and available on websites through Public Radio International, National Public Radio and WNYC radio. Nimoy was honored by Symphony Space with the renaming of the Thalia Theater as the Leonard Nimoy Thalia Theater.

==== Special appearances ====
From 1982 to 1987, Nimoy hosted the children&#x27;s educational show &quot;Standby...Lights! Camera! Action!&quot; on Nickelodeon. He was an occasional voice actor in animated feature films, including the character of Galvatron in &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; in 1986. He narrated the 1991 CBS paranormal series &quot;Haunted Lives: True Ghost Stories&quot;. In 1994, he voiced Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in &quot;The Pagemaster&quot;. In 1998, he had a leading role as Mustapha Mond in &quot;Brave New World&quot;, a TV-movie version of Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1932 novel.
From 1994 to 1997, he narrated the &quot;Ancient Mysteries&quot; series on A&amp;E including &quot;The Sacred Water of Lourdes&quot; and &quot;Secrets of the Romanovs&quot;. He appeared in advertising in the United Kingdom for the computer company Time Computers in the late 1990s. In 1997, he played the prophet Samuel, alongside Nathaniel Parker, in &quot;The Bible Collection&quot; movie &quot;David&quot;. He appeared in several popular television series, including &quot;Futurama&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, both as himself and as Spock. In 2000, he provided on-camera hosting and introductions for 45 half-hour episodes of the anthology series &quot;Our 20th Century&quot; on the AEN TV Network. The series covers world news, sports, entertainment, technology, and fashion using original archive news clips from 1930 to 1975 from the National Archives in Washington, D.C. and other private archival sources.

In 2001, Nimoy appeared on the television show &quot;Becker&quot;, where he played Dr. Emmett Fowler, a professor who cannot recall his former student.

Nimoy played the recurring enigmatic character of Dr.William Bell on the television show &quot;Fringe&quot;. Nimoy opted for the role after previously working with Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman on the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film and offered another opportunity to work with this production team again. Nimoy also was interested in the series, which he saw was an intelligent mixture of science and science fiction, and continued to guest star through the show&#x27;s fourth season, even after his stated 2012 retirement from acting. Nimoy&#x27;s first appearance as Bell was in the Season1 finale, &quot;There&#x27;s More Than One of Everything&quot;, which explored the possible existence of a parallel universe. In the May 9, 2009, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Nimoy appeared as a surprise guest in the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment with Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine, who play the young Spock and Kirk in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; which had just premiered days earlier. In the sketch, the three actors attempt to appease long-time Trekkers by assuring them the new film would be true to the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

==== Producer ====
In 1991, Nimoy starred in &quot;Never Forget&quot;, which he co-produced with Robert B. Radnitz. The movie was about a &quot;pro bono publico&quot; lawsuit by an attorney on behalf of Mel Mermelstein, played by Nimoy as an Auschwitz survivor, against a group of organizations engaged in Holocaust denial. Nimoy said he experienced a strong &quot;sense of fulfillment&quot; from doing the film. In 2007, he produced the play, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Will&quot; by Canadian Playwright Vern Thiessen. The one-woman show starred Jeanmarie Simpson as Shakespeare&#x27;s wife, Anne Hathaway. The production was directed by Nimoy&#x27;s wife, Susan Bay.

=== Semi-retirement ===
In April 2010, Nimoy announced that he was retiring from playing Spock, citing both his advanced age and the desire to give Zachary Quinto full media attention as the character. &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep&quot; was to be his final performance; however, in February 2011, he announced his intent to return to &quot;Fringe&quot; and reprise his role as William Bell. Nimoy continued voice acting during retirement; his appearance in the third season of &quot;Fringe&quot; includes his voice (his character appears only in animated scenes), and he provided the voice of Sentinel Prime in &quot;&quot;. In May 2011, he made a cameo appearance in the alternate version music video of &quot;The Lazy Song&quot; by Bruno Mars. Aaron Bay-Schuck, the Atlantic Records executive who signed Mars to the label, is Nimoy&#x27;s stepson.

Nimoy provided the voice of Spock as a guest star in a Season5 episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; titled &quot;The Transporter Malfunction&quot;, which aired on March 29, 2012. Also in 2012, Nimoy reprised his role of William Bell in &quot;Fringe&quot; for the fourth season episodes &quot;Letters of Transit&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot; parts1 and2. Nimoy reprised his role as Master Xehanort in the 2012 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;. On August 30, 2012, Nimoy narrated a satirical segment about Mitt Romney&#x27;s life on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;. In 2013, Nimoy reprised his role as Ambassador Spock in a cameo appearance in &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;.

== Other career work ==
=== Photography ===
Nimoy&#x27;s interest in photography began in childhood; for the rest of his life, he owned a camera he had rebuilt at the age of 13. During the 1970s, he studied photography at the University of California, Los Angeles. His photography studies at UCLA occurred after &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; while he was seriously considering changing careers. His work has been exhibited at the R. Michelson Galleries in Northampton, Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.

=== Directing ===
Nimoy&#x27;s directorial debut was in 1973, with the &quot;Death on a Barge&quot; segment for an episode of &quot;Night Gallery&quot; during its final season. In the early 1980s, he resumed directing consistently, including television and film.

Nimoy began feature film directing in 1984 with &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, the third in the film series. He directed the second most successful movie (critically and financially) in the franchise, &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986), and then &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, the highest-grossing film of 1987. These successes made him a star director. He directed &quot;The Good Mother&quot; (1988) and &quot;Funny About Love&quot; (1990). In 1994 he directed his last feature film, &quot;Holy Matrimony&quot;. His final directorial credit was &quot;Killshot&quot;, the 1995 pilot episode for &quot;Deadly Games&quot;, a short-lived science-fiction television series.

At a press conference promoting the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie, he said he had no further plans or ambition to direct although he enjoyed it.

=== Writing ===
Nimoy authored two volumes of autobiography. The first is &quot;I Am Not Spock&quot; (1975) and was controversial, as many fans incorrectly assumed Nimoy was distancing himself from the Spock character. In the book, Nimoy conducts dialogues between himself and Spock. The contents of this first autobiography also touched on a self-proclaimed &quot;identity crisis&quot; that seemed to haunt Nimoy throughout his career. It also related to an apparent love and hate relationship with the character of Spock and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In the second volume, &quot;I Am Spock&quot; (1995), Nimoy communicates that he finally realized his years of portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely Nimoy&#x27;s contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things in a way he never would have, had he not portrayed the character. Nimoy maintained that in some meaningful sense he had merged with Spock while distancing between fact and fiction. In 2014, the audiobook version of &quot;I Am Spock&quot;, read by Nimoy, was published.

He composed several volumes of poetry, some published along with a number of his photographs. A later poetic volume titled &quot;A Lifetime of Love: Poems on the Passages of Life&quot; was published in 2002. His poetry can be found in the Contemporary Poets index of The HyperTexts. Nimoy adapted and starred in the one-man play &quot;Vincent&quot; (1981), based on the play &quot;Van Gogh&quot; (1979) by Phillip Stephens.

In 1995, Nimoy was involved in the production of &quot;Primortals&quot;, a comic book series published by Tekno Comix about first contact with aliens, which had arisen from a discussion he had with Isaac Asimov. There was a novelization by Steve Perry.

=== Music ===
In December 1966, when it became apparent that the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; was developing a strong following in spite of low Nielsen ratings, Dot Records approached the producers of the show. The result was the signing of Nimoy to that label. Dot Records was a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures, and both Paramount and Desilu—the studio producing &quot;Star Trek&quot;—were acquired by Gulf+Western: first Paramount in 1966, and then Desilu in 1967. So after the merger of the two companies, Nimoy wound up working for Paramount both as an actor (from 1966 to 1971) and singer (from 1967 to 1970), doing two television series (&quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;&quot;) and five albums. Nimoy later recorded a few spoken word albums and contributed narration to albums such as &quot;Whales Alive&quot;.

Nimoy&#x27;s voice appeared in sampled form on a song by the pop band Information Society in the late Eighties. The song, &quot;What&#x27;s on Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot; (released in 1988), reached No.3 on the US Pop charts, and No.1 on the Dance charts.

Nimoy played the part of the chauffeur in the 1985 music video of The Bangles&#x27; cover version of &quot;Going Down to Liverpool&quot;. He also appeared in the alternate music video for the song &quot;The Lazy Song&quot; by pop artist Bruno Mars.

== Personal life ==

Nimoy was long active in the Jewish community, and could speak and read Yiddish. In 1997, he narrated the documentary &quot;A Life Apart: Hasidism in America&quot;, about the various sects of Hasidic Orthodox Jews. In October 2002, Nimoy published &quot;The Shekhina Project&quot;, a photographic study exploring the feminine aspect of God&#x27;s presence, inspired by Kabbalah. Reactions have varied from enthusiastic support to open condemnation. Nimoy said objections to Shekhina did not bother or surprise him, but he smarted at the stridency of the Orthodox protests, and was saddened at the attempt to control thought.

Nimoy was married twice. In 1954, he married Sandra Zober (1927-2011), an actress; they had two children: film producer and director Julie, and director Adam. After 32 years of marriage, he reportedly left Sandra on her 56th birthday and divorced her in 1987. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1989, Nimoy married his second wife, actress Susan Bay, cousin of director Michael Bay.

After two years of part-time study, in 1977 Nimoy earned an MA in education from Antioch College. In 2000, he received an honorary doctorate from Antioch University in Ohio, awarded for activism in Holocaust remembrance, the arts, and the environment. In 2012, he received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Boston University.

In the 2001 documentary film &quot;Mind Meld&quot;, in which Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner discuss their acting careers and personal lives, Nimoy revealed that he had become an alcoholic while working on &quot;Star Trek&quot; and ended up in drug rehabilitation. William Shatner, in his 2008 book &quot;Up Till Now: The Autobiography&quot;, spoke about how later in their lives, Nimoy tried to help Shatner&#x27;s alcoholic wife, Nerine Kidd.

Nimoy has said that the character of Spock, which he played twelve to fourteen hours a day, five days a week, influenced his personality in his private life. Each weekend during the original run of the series, he would be in character throughout Saturday and into Sunday, behaving more like Spock than himself—more logical, more rational, more thoughtful, less emotional, and finding calm in every situation. It was only on Sunday in the early afternoon that Spock&#x27;s influence on his behavior diminished enough to allow him to feel more himself again—only to start the cycle over again on Monday morning. Years after the show, he observed Vulcan speech patterns, social attitudes, patterns of logic, and emotional suppression in his own behavior.

Nimoy was a private pilot and had owned an airplane. The Space Foundation bestowed to him the 2010 Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award for creating a positive role model that inspired countless viewers to learn more about the universe.

In 2009, Nimoy was honored by his childhood hometown when the Office of Mayor Thomas Menino proclaimed the date of November 14, 2009, as &quot;Leonard Nimoy Day&quot; in the City of Boston.

In 2014, Walter Koenig revealed that Nimoy personally and successfully advocated to the show&#x27;s producers for equal pay for Nichelle Nichols&#x27;s work on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. This incident was confirmed by Nimoy in a Trekmovie interview, and happened during his years at Desilu.

Nimoy has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On June 2, 2015, the asteroid 4864 Nimoy was named after him.

== Illness and death ==
In January 2014, Nimoy revealed publicly that he had been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition he attributed to a smoking addiction he had quit about 30 years earlier. On February 19, 2015, having been in and out of hospitals for several months, Nimoy was taken to UCLA Medical Center for chest pains.

On February 25, 2015, Nimoy fell into a coma, and died of complications from COPD at his home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on the morning of February 27, at the age of 83. Adam Nimoy said that as his father came closer to death, &quot;he mellowed out. He made his family a priority and his career became secondary.&quot; A few days before his death, Nimoy shared some of his poetry on Twitter: &quot;A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory. LLAP&quot;. It was his final tweet.

He was buried at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles on March 1, 2015. The service was attended by nearly 300 family members, friends, and former colleagues, including Zachary Quinto, Chris Pine, and J. J. Abrams. Though William Shatner did not attend, he was represented by his daughters.

=== Personal tributes ===

Cast members of &quot;Star Trek&quot; who had worked alongside Nimoy gave personal tributes after his death. William Shatner wrote, &quot;I loved him like a brother... We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love.&quot; George Takei called him an &quot;extraordinarily talented man&quot; and a &quot;very decent human being&quot;. Walter Koenig said that after working with him, he discovered Nimoy&#x27;s &quot;compassion, his intelligence and his humanity&quot;. Nichelle Nichols noted that Nimoy&#x27;s integrity, passion and devotion as an actor &quot;helped transport &quot;Star Trek&quot; into television history.&quot; Quinto, who portrayed Spock as a young man in &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, wrote, &quot;My heart is broken. I love you profoundly, my dear friend. And I will miss you every day.&quot;

U.S. President Barack Obama, who had met Nimoy in 2007, remembered him as &quot;a lifelong lover of the arts and humanities, a supporter of the sciences, generous with his talent and his time&quot;. Former NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin called Nimoy &quot;a fellow space traveler because he helped make the journey into the final frontier accessible to us all&quot;.
&quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, which made frequent references to Spock, and for which Nimoy voiced one episode, paid tribute to him after his death. Creator Chuck Lorre&#x27;s vanity card at the end of the Season 8 episode, &quot;The Colonization Application&quot; (airing on March 5), featured a picture of Nimoy with the caption, &quot;The impact you had on our show and on our lives is everlasting.&quot;

The 136th episode of the web series &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd&quot; created by and starring James Rolfe, which covered &quot;Seaman&quot;, was dedicated to Nimoy.

As part of a campaign for the 2016 feature film &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, aimed at benefiting several charities, Zachary Quinto and other cast members posted a video tribute to Nimoy, and the film itself paid tribute to him. Its director, Justin Lin, explained: &quot;It&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll see in the film. It obviously affected everybody, because he&#x27;s been a big part of our lives. There&#x27;s an attempt to acknowledge that in some way.&quot;

Adam Nimoy directed a biographical documentary on his father, &quot;For the Love of Spock&quot;, which Quinto narrated and with which Shatner was also involved. For charity, Shatner used selfies made by Nimoy&#x27;s fans to create an online tribute mosaic of the Vulcan salute.

In June 2015, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory named a -wide asteroid 4864 Nimoy, originally discovered in 1988, in the Solar System&#x27;s main asteroid belt.

Shatner wrote a book about his friendship with Nimoy titled &quot;Leonard: My Fifty Year Friendship with a Remarkable Man&quot;, released on February 16, 2016.

In April 2017, a biographical documentary about his illness, &quot;Remembering Leonard Nimoy&quot; was released, produced by his daughter Julie.

In front of the Boston Museum of Science, a memorial to Nimoy is planned for installation, near where he grew up in the West End of Boston. The monumental sculpture will be a larger-than-life representation of a hand displaying his iconic &quot;live long and prosper&quot; gesture. , the project is at least 75% funded.
