<text>Touring car racing is a motorsport road racing competition that uses race-prepared touring cars. It has both similarities to and significant differences from stock car racing, which is popular in the United States.

While the cars do not move as fast as those in formula or sports car races, their similarity both to one another and to fans&#x27; own vehicles makes for well-supported racing. The lesser use of aerodynamics means following cars have a much easier time passing than in open-wheel racing, and the more substantial bodies of the cars makes the subtle bumping and nudging for overtaking much more acceptable as part of racing.

As well as short &quot;sprint&quot; races, many touring car series include one or more endurance races, which last anything from 3 to 24 hours and are a test of reliability and pit crews as much as car, driver speed, and consistency.

==Characteristics==

Touring car racing started in the mid twentieth century as a long-format style of competition that took place on public roads between numerous towns. The cars were crewed by a driver and, because of their unreliability, a mechanic who carried tools and spares. The legacy of these beginnings can still be seen in modern touring and GT carsthe driver sits offset from the centreline of the car and there is space for a second seat (although they are rarely fitted any more).

While rules vary from country to country and series to series, most series require that the competitors start with a standard car body, but virtually every other component may be allowed to be heavily modified for racing, including engines, suspension, brakes, wheels and tires. Aerodynamic aids are sometimes added to the front and rear of the cars. Regulations are usually designed to limit costs by banning some of the more exotic technologies available (for instance, many series insist on a &quot;control tire&quot; that all competitors must use) and keep the racing close (sometimes by ballast weight where winning a race requires the winner&#x27;s car to be heavier for subsequent races).

Touring cars share some similarity with American stock car racing. Touring cars are, at least notionally, derived from production cars as most stock car racing outside of NASCAR, including street stock and late model racing, continue to be. NASCAR circuits have since moved to a custom platform independent of production cars, unlike touring car circuits. Touring car racing is also referred to as &quot;saloon car racing&quot;.

==Series of competition==

===FIA TCR World Tour===

&quot;Worldwide&quot;
Modern World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) started in 2005, evolving from the reborn European Touring Car Championship. The series merged with the TCR International Series and became the World Touring Car Cup (WTCR) starting from 2018. In 2023, the WTCR was replaced by the TCR World Tour.

Running at major international racing facilities, this series is supported by BMW, SEAT and Chevrolet. The latter fields a works team, whereas the other two only sell racing kits to be installed on their cars, providing technical support to their customers. In 2011, Volvo also entered the championship, fielding a one-car team as an evaluation for a possible heavier commitment to the series. The World Touring Car Championship features 1.6-litre cars built to &quot;Super 2000&quot; regulations based on FIA Group N.

Following the trend of recent FIA rules, cost control is a major theme in the technical regulation.
In 2011 the rules concerning the engine capacity have changed, switching from 2000 cc to 1600 cc turbo engines. Cars equipped with the old 2000 cc engines are still eligible in the championship. Many technologies that have featured in production cars are not allowed, for example: variable valve timing, variable intake geometry, ABS braking and traction control.

===British Touring Car Championship===

&quot;United Kingdom&quot;
The British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) currently competes at nine circuits in the UK with cars built to Next Generation Touring Car specification, with ballast being used to equalise performance. From 2011, cars that ran to the BTCC&#x27;s own Next Generation Touring Car specification were eligible to compete in a phased move away from Super 2000 regulations. Cars are 2.0-litre saloons, station wagons and hatchbacks with over and can be front or rear-wheel drive. During the 2016 season manufacturer team entries came from BMW, Subaru, MG, and Honda. Since BTCC budgets have been kept relatively low, there is a strong independent and privateer presence in the championship. Manufacturers represented by privateers include Vauxhall, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen, Chevrolet, and Audi.

Prior to 2001 the BTCC was contested by cars built to 2.0-litre supertouring regulations and had in its heyday up to nine different manufacturers. Joachim Winkelhock stated on several occasions that it was the best touring car championship in the world, and many champions of that era now race in the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC). Between 2002 and 2006 the BTCC ran its own Touring class with Super Production/Super 2000 cars making up the numbers; the Touring class was phased out (only privateers are eligible to run old Touring cars) with the intention of a pure Super 2000 series. The introduction of the Next Generation Touring Car specification, from 2011, started a phased transition from Super 2000 cars in an effort to cut costs and improve the sport.

===DTM===

&quot;Germany/Europe&quot;
The DTM series, the initials standing for &quot;Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft&quot; until 1996, then following a hiatus, revived as &quot;Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters&quot; in 2000, features advanced purpose built 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-powered space frame machines, covered with largely carbon fibre bodyshapes resembling the manufacturers&#x27; road machine (although the roof and roof pillars do originate from the production car). In order to lower costs, the engine power is limited to , and transmissions, brakes and tyres (Hankook) are standard parts for all. Also, dimensions and aerodynamics are equalised. The approx. (without driver) DTM cars corner incredibly quickly and wear spectacular bodykits incorporating huge wheel arches and diffusers, plus a drag-reduction system (DRS) designed to encourage overtaking.

More than 20 works-backed entries of the Opel Astra, Audi TT and Mercedes-Benz CLK contested the revived 2000 DTM series but a serious issue developed for the series when Opel pulled out ahead of the 2006 season. BMW would eventually replace Opel as the series&#x27; third manufacturer for 2012, while Mercedes-AMG withdrew at the end of 2018. Mercedes-AMG was replaced by a privately funded Aston Martin Vantage program that did not last beyond the 2019 season.

For the 2019 season, major technical changes occurred. Turbochargers were reintroduced in accordance with new regulations impacting engines and power outputs, as all cars are now required to have 2.0-litre 4-cylinder single turbo engines, replacing the 4.0L V8s that had been used since the series&#x27; revival in 2000. Engine power was increased from ~500 hp to 610 hp, with an extra 30 hp available as part of a push-to-pass system available to drivers for the first time. Downforce levels were also reduced to encourage overtaking and increase top speeds to 300 km/h (186 mph) in order to improve the racing spectacle.

In 2019, DTM formed a partnership with the Japanese sports car series Super GT which runs a near identical set of rules and regulations in its GT500 class. Honda, Toyota – represented via Lexus, and Nissan each entered a wildcard entry for the final race of the 2019 season at the Hockenheimring. The cars entered were a Nissan GT-R (R35), a Lexus LC 500 and a Honda NSX. For the weekend of the 22nd-24 November, DTM sent three BMW M4s and four Audi RS5s to take part in a non-championship race at Fuji Speedway along with the full GT500 grid, labelled the &#x27;SUPER GT x DTM Dream Race&#x27;. Aston Martin withdrew from the event as they intended to focus on developing the Vantage package for 2020, however this never eventuated as the program was ended.

Audi announced in late April 2020 that they would be discontinuing their involvement in the series after the end of the 2020 season, following the same path Mercedes-Benz did after the end of the 2018 season; focusing on electric motorsport, most notably Formula E. This will leave BMW as the sole manufacturer left, putting the series&#x27; future in serious jeopardy.

===Nürburgring NLS Endurance Racing Series===
&quot;Germany&quot;
Since 1997, and nowadays still on the over long famous old Nürburgring and other circuits worldwide, in average over 150 touring cars compete in the NLS series of ten typically four-hour-long races. Cars range from old road legal compacts to Porsche 996 and even modified DTM cars (). Most entrants of the 24 Hours Nürburgring collect experience here.

===Scandinavian Touring Car Championship===

&quot;Sweden/Denmark&quot;
Between 1996 and 2010 the Swedish Touring Car Championship contained various races in Sweden and a few in Denmark. The most successful car makes were Volvo, BMW, Audi, and Nissan. In 2010 the championship merged with the Danish Touringcar Championship to form the Scandinavian Touring Car Championship. The 2010 champion was Robert Dahlgren, because he had achieved the best results from selected races in the Danish and Swedish championships. Rickard Rydell and Johan Kristoffersson won the championship in 2011 and 2012, in a Chevrolet and a VW, respectively. In 2013 the series merged with the TTA – Racing Elite League to form the 2013 STCC – Racing Elite League season, starring 17 drivers for Volvo, BMW, Saab, Citroën, Dacia, and Honda.

===Supercars Championship===

&quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;New Zealand&quot;

Formerly the Australian Touring Car Championship, Supercars are recognised internationally as the &#x27;fastest touring cars in the world&#x27; racing at speeds that can reach nearly 300 km/h. They are also the most expensive touring cars in the world with each car costing in excess of $1 million (AUD) which includes bespoke $250,000 (AUD) 5.0-litre V8 engines producing approximately 635 hp (473 kW). The current formula was devised in 1993 (based on Group A regulations) and branded as &#x27;V8 Supercars&#x27; in 1997 and &#x27;Supercars&#x27; in 2016. The series features grids of approximately 25 cars, although selected events feature wildcard entries which add to the grid. The cars are currently based on the Ford Mustang GT and Holden Commodore (ZB) The minimum weight for a Supercar including driver is . The Commodore will be replaced by a Chevrolet Camaro in 2022. The race cars themselves are derived from production body panels and space frame chassis. Both body styles feature an aerodynamic package incorporating large front and rear wings designed to ensure equal aerodynamic performance between the two vehicle types.

The series incorporates the world famous Bathurst 1000 race as a championship round. Because of the longer distance, regulations require two drivers per car for this race. This also applies to The Bend 500 &amp; the Gold Coast 600. These events make up the Pirtek Enduro Cup, which is a championship-within-a-championship where the driver combination with most points collected over these three endurance races wins a trophy.

In Australia, Supercars enjoys a strong support base that is still driven in large part by the tribal Ford versus Holden battle. Over 200,000 total spectators attend the four-day Adelaide 500 and Bathurst 1000 events, and the 2019 Bathurst 1000 drew a maximum of 2.36 million television viewers across the country. This compares favourably with other major sporting events such as the AFL Grand Final with 2.2 million TV viewers in 2019. Supercars is also popular in New Zealand, with a regular round formerly held in the country (previously held at Pukekohe) being the only international event on the series calendar. Attempts at further international expansion were made in China, Malaysia, the Middle East, and the United States during the 2000s and 2010s, none of which have survived.

As the series has grown, major international motorsport organisations have become involved such as Team Penske, Andretti Autosport, United Autosports and Triple Eight Race Engineering.

Both Ford and Holden financially and technically supported their favoured teams and took an active role in promotion of the series from its beginning, but began to wind back and ultimately withdraw their financial commitments approximately in line with the decline in sales and eventual discontinuation of the Falcon in 2016 and Commodore in 2020 (the two models that exclusively competed in the V8 formula from 1993 to 2012). Ford withdrew all financial support after 2015, and Holden cut most of its support back to only the Red Bull Holden Racing Team from 2017. Holden was shut down as a brand during 2020, ending its factory involvement in Supercars after the 2020 season, while Ford returned for the 2019 season with the Mustang project. The Commodore will be replaced with a Chevrolet Camaro, which will be sold in Australia by General Motors Specialty Vehicles.

Other manufacturers have also appeared in the series, including Nissan with Kelly Racing, Volvo with Garry Rogers Motorsport, and Mercedes-Benz in a non-factory-supported program from Erebus Motorsport. With Kelly Racing&#x27;s switch to Ford Mustangs for 2020 after a year of running its Nissan Altimas privately, Supercars reverted to a two-make Ford vs. Holden competition.

<text>Sports car racing is a form of motorsport road racing which utilises sports cars that have two seats and enclosed wheels. They may be either purpose-built sports prototypes which are the highest level in sports car racing or grand tourers (GT cars) based on road-going models and therefore, in general, not as fast as sports prototypes. Sports car races are often, though not always, endurance races that are run over particularly long distances or large amounts of time, resulting in a larger emphasis on the reliability and efficiency of the car and its drivers as opposed to outright car performance or driver skills. The FIA World Endurance Championship and IMSA SportsCar Championship are examples of some of the best known sports car racing series. Sports car racing is one of the main types of circuit auto racing, alongside open-wheel racing (such as Formula One), touring car racing (such as BTCC, which is based on &#x27;saloon cars&#x27; as opposed to the &#x27;exotics&#x27; seen in sports cars) and stock car racing (such as NASCAR).

A type of hybrid between the purism of open-wheelers and the familiarity of touring car racing, this style is often best associated with the annual 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. First run in 1923, Le Mans is one of the oldest motor races still in existence. Other classic but now defunct sports car races include the Italian classics, the Targa Florio (1906–1977) and Mille Miglia (1927–1957), and the Mexican Carrera Panamericana (1950–1954). Most top-class sports car races emphasise endurance (generally between 6 and 24 hours), reliability, and strategy, over pure speed. Longer races usually involve complex pit strategy and regular driver changes. As a result, sports car racing is seen more as a team endeavour than an individual sport, with team managers such as John Wyer, Tom Walkinshaw, driver-turned-constructor Henri Pescarolo, Peter Sauber and Reinhold Joest becoming almost as famous as some of their drivers.

The prestige of storied marques such as Porsche, Audi, Chevrolet, Ferrari, Jaguar, Bentley, Aston Martin, Lotus, Maserati, Lamborghini, Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW is built in part upon success in sports car racing. These makers&#x27; top road cars have often been very similar both in engineering and styling to those raced. This close association with the &#x27;exotic&#x27; nature of the cars serves as a useful distinction between sports car racing and touring cars.

The 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring and 24 Hours of Le Mans are considered to form the Triple Crown of endurance racing. Other crown jewel sports car endurance races include Petit Le Mans, Nürburgring 24 Hours, Spa 24 Hours, Bathurst 12 Hour and Suzuka 1000km.

==History==
===Evolution===
According to historian Richard Hough, &quot;It is obviously impossible to distinguish between the designers of sports cars and Grand Prix machines during the pre-1914 period. The late Georges Faroux contended that sports-car racing was not born until the first 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1923, and while as a joint-creator of that race he may have been prejudiced in his opinion, it is certainly true that sports-car racing as it was known after 1919 did not exist before the First World War.&quot;

In the 1920s, the cars used in endurance racing and Grand Prix were still basically identical, with fenders and two seats, to carry a mechanic if necessary or permitted. Cars such as the Bugatti Type 35 were almost equally at home in Grands Prix and endurance events, but specialisation gradually started to differentiate the sports-racer from the Grand Prix car. The legendary Alfa Romeo Tipo A Monoposto started the evolution of the true single-seater in the early 1930s; the Grand Prix racer and its miniature voiturette offspring rapidly evolved into high performance single seaters optimised for relatively short races, by dropping fenders and the second seat. During the later 1930s, French constructors, unable to keep up with the progress of the Mercedes-Benz and Auto-Union cars in GP racing, withdrew into primarily domestic competition with large-capacity sports cars – marques such as Delahaye, Talbot and the later Bugattis were locally prominent.

Similarly, through the 1920s and 1930s the road-going sports/GT car started to emerge as distinct from fast tourers (Le Mans had originally been a race for touring cars) and sports cars, whether descended from primarily road-going vehicles or developed from pure-bred racing cars came to dominate races such as Le Mans and the Mille Miglia.

In open-road endurance races across Europe such as the Mille Miglia, Tour de France and Targa Florio, which were often run on dusty roads, the need for fenders and a mechanic or navigator was still there. As mainly Italian cars and races defined the genre, the category came to be known as Gran Turismo (particularly in the 1950s), as long distances had to be travelled, rather than running around on short circuits only. Reliability and some basic comfort were necessary in order to endure the task.

===Post-war revival===

After the Second World War, sports car racing emerged as a distinct form of racing with its own classic races, and, from 1953, its own FIA sanctioned World Sportscar Championship. In the 1950s, sports car racing was regarded as almost as important as Grand Prix competition, with major marques like Ferrari, Maserati, Jaguar and Aston Martin investing much effort in their works programmes and supplying cars to customers; sports racers lost their close relationship to road-going sports cars in the 1950s and the major races were contested by dedicated competition cars such as the Jaguar C and D types, the Mercedes 300SLR, Maserati 300S, Aston Martin DBR1 and assorted Ferraris including the first Testa Rossas. Top Grand Prix drivers also competed regularly in sports car racing. After major accidents at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 1957 Mille Miglia the power of sports cars was curbed with a 3-litre engine capacity limit applied to them in the World Championship from 1958. From 1962 sports cars temporarily took a back seat to GT cars with the FIA replacing the World Championship for Sports Cars with the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.

===Growth at a national level===
In national rather than international racing, sports car competition in the 1950s and early 1960s tended to reflect what was locally popular, with the cars that were successful locally often influencing each nation&#x27;s approach to competing on the international stage.

In the US, imported Italian, German and British cars battled local hybrids, with initially very distinct East and West Coast scenes; these gradually converged and a number of classic races and important teams emerged including Camoradi, Briggs Cunningham and so on. The US scene tended to feature small MG and Porsche cars in the smaller classes, and imported Jaguar, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Allard and Ferrari cars in the larger classes.

A breed of powerful hybrids appeared in the 50s and 60s and raced on both sides of the Atlantic, featuring European chassis and large American engines – from the early Allard cars via hybrids such as Lotus 19s fitted with large engines through to the AC Cobra. The combination of mostly British chassis and American V8 engines gave rise to the popular and spectacular Can-Am series in the 1960s and 1970s.

In Britain 2-litre sports cars were initially popular (the Bristol engine being readily available and cheap), subsequently 1100 cc sports racers became a very popular category for young drivers (effectively supplanting 500 cc F3), with Lola, Lotus, Cooper and others being very competitive, although at the other end of the scale in the early to mid-1960s the national sports racing scene also attracted sophisticated GTs and later a crop of large-engined &quot;big bangers&quot; the technology of which largely gave rise to Can-Am but soon died out. Clubmans provided much entertainment at club-racing level from the 1960s into the 1990s and John Webb revived interest in big sports prototypes with Thundersports in the 1980s. There was even enough interest in Group C to sustain a C2 championship for a few years; at &#x27;club&#x27; level Modified Sports Car (&quot;ModSports&quot;) and Production Sports Car (&quot;ProdSports&quot;) races remained a feature of most British race meetings into the 1980s, evolving into a &quot;Special GT&quot; series that was essentially Formula Libre for sports or saloon cars. After a relative period of decline in the 1980s a British GT Championship emerged in the mid-90s.

Italy found itself with both grassroots racing with a plethora of Fiat based specials (often termed &quot;etceterinis&quot;) and small Alfa Romeos, and exotica such as Maserati and Ferrari – who also sold cars to domestic customers as well as racing on the world stage. Road races such as the Mille Miglia included everything from stock touring cars to World Championship contenders. The Mille Miglia was the largest sporting event in Italy until a fatal accident caused its demise in 1957. The Targa Florio, another tough road race, remained part of the world championship until the 1970s and remained as a local race for many years afterwards.

As the French car industry switched from making large powerful cars to small utilitarian ones, French sports cars of the 1950s and early 1960s tended to be small-capacity and highly aerodynamic (often based on Panhard or Renault components), aimed at winning the &quot;Index of Performance&quot; at Le Mans and Reims and triumphing in handicap races. Between the late 1960s and late 1970s, Matra and Renault made significant and successful efforts to win at Le Mans.

In Germany, domestic production based racing was largely dominated by BMW, Porsche and Mercedes-Benz, although sports car/GT racing gradually became eclipsed by touring cars and the initially sports car based Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft gradually evolved into the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft. Porsche started to evolve a line of sports prototypes from the late 1950s; noted for their toughness and reliability they started to win in races of attrition such as the Targa Florio and as they grew bigger (via the Porsche 910 to the Porsche 908 and finally the Porsche 917) the Stuttgart marque became first a competitor for overall wins and then came to dominate sports car racing – both they and Mercedes have made intermittent returns to the top level of the sport through the 1970s, 80s, 90s and 2010s.

Sports car racing has intermittently been popular in Japan – in the 1960s small-capacity sports racers and even a local version of the Group 7 cars as raced in the Canadian-American Challenge Cup were popular; a healthy local sports prototype championship ran until the early 1990s and now the Super GT series provides high-budget exposure to manufacturers, with many international drivers appearing. The Japanese manufacturers have also been frequent visitors to the US sports car scene (Nissan and Toyota in particular during the heyday of IMSA) and to the European scene, in particular Le Mans, where despite many years of trying by all the main Japanese marques the only victory to have been scored by a Japanese marque was by Mazda in 1991, until 2018 when Toyota scored a first and second-place finish. Toyota followed this with another 1-2 finish in 2019.
===1960s and 1970s – Evolution, rise, and decline===

Powerful prototypes (effectively pure-bred two-seater racing cars with no real link to production vehicles) started to appear as the 1960s progressed, with worldwide battles between Ferrari, Ford, Porsche, Lotus, Alfa Romeo and Matra as well as other more specialist marques running on into the early 1970s. The competition at Le Mans even made it to the movie screens, with Steve McQueen&#x27;s film Le Mans. This era was seen by many as the highpoint of sports car racing, with the technology and performance of the cars comfortably in excess of what was seen in Formula 1. Homologation saw many out-and-out racing cars produced in sufficient quantities to see them classed as production vehicles; the FIA responded by placing more restrictions on even the allegedly production-based cars and placed draconian limits on the power available to prototypes – these prototypes of the late 1960s/early 1970s were comfortably quicker than contemporary Grand Prix machinery and for 1972 they were constrained to run much smaller engines to F1 rules, often de-tuned for endurance. Group 4 Grand Touring Cars and Group 5 Special Production Cars became the premier form of &quot;sports car&quot; racing from 1976, with prototypes going into a general decline apart from Porsche 936 domination at Le Mans and a lower-key series of races for smaller two-litre Group 6 prototypes.

A peculiarly American form of sports car racing was the Can-Am series, in which virtually unlimited sports prototypes competed in relatively short races. This series ran from 1966 to 1974 and was an expansion of the USRRC that conformed to FIA Group 7 rules. The original Can-Am fell victim to rising costs and the energy crisis.

The ACO, organisers of the Le Mans 24 Hours, attempted to come up with a formula that would encourage more prototypes back to the race but would also be relatively economical – their Grand Touring Prototype rules in the late 1970s, based on fuel consumption rules, gave rise to two different varieties of sports car racing that were widely held to be a high point in the history of the sport.

===1980s – Group C and IMSA GTP===
In Europe, the FIA adopted the ACO GTP rules virtually unchanged and sanctioned the Group C World Endurance Championship (or World Sportscar Championship), featuring high-tech closed-cockpit prototypes from Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Jaguar and others. In the US, the IMSA Camel GTP series boasted close competition between huge fields of manufacturer-backed teams and privateer squads – the cars were technically similar to Group Cs but used a sliding scale of weights and engine capacities to try to limit performance. Both Group C and GTP had secondary categories, respectively Group C2 and Camel Lights, for less powerful cars, targeting entries by small specialist constructors or serious amateur teams.

The FIA attempted to make Group C into a virtual &quot;two seater Grand Prix&quot; format in the early 1990s, with engine rules in common with F1, short race distances, and a schedule dovetailing with that of the F1 rounds. This drove up costs and drove away entrants and crowds, and by 1993 prototype racing was dead in Europe, with the Peugeot, Jaguar, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz teams all having withdrawn.

===1990s – Rebirth and revival===
In an attempt to provide a top-class endurance racing series to replace the WSPC, a number of GT series sprung up at national and European level, with the BPR series eventually evolving into the FIA GT Championship. IMSA GTP continued for a few more years but was replaced by a series for World Sports Cars – relatively simple open-top prototypes – which gave rise to cars such as the Ferrari 333SP and the Riley &amp; Scott Mk 3, supported by GTs. As the 1990s progressed, these prototypes and others like them started to be raced in Europe and an FIA Sports Car series evolved for them.

Since the demise of Group C (where Japan and Germany both had successful series of their own) Japan has largely gone its own way in sports car racing; the Super GT series is for very highly modified production-based cars; although prototypes are slowly returning to Japanese racing in the Japan Le Mans Challenge many of these &#x27;prototypes&#x27; are little more than rebodied Formula 3 cars (although there has been a long Japanese tradition of such hybrids; a Grand Champion series ran for many years with rebodied Formula 2 and Formula 3000 cars, rather similar to the second incarnation of Can-Am).

In the US, however, road racing actually saw a decline. The IMSA GT Championship had been prototype-based since 1983, with less emphasis on production cars. NASCAR was becoming increasingly dominant, and the IndyCar Series&#x27; split from CART in 1996 put more emphasis on ovals regarding domestic open-wheel racing. Also contributing to the decline was the retirement of Mario Andretti from Formula One. It would be over a decade before another American driver would join Formula One, viz. Scott Speed, although Speed was ultimately unsuccessful and eventually joined NASCAR himself.

===2000s – Resurgence in the US===

The debut of the SpeedVision television network brought a resurgence of interest in sports car racing in the US, with the network originally showing a large amount of sports car racing and sports car–related programming before being replaced by Fox Sports.

The IMSA GT Series evolved into the American Le Mans Series; the European races eventually became the closely related Le Mans Series, both of which mix prototypes and GTs; the FIA remains more interested in its own GT and GT3 championships, with the ACO&#x27;s rules the basis for the LMS and ALMS. The Le Mans Prototype is somewhat reminiscent of the old Can Am prototype.

Further splits in the American scene saw the Grand American Road Racing Association form a separate series, the Rolex Sports Car Series, with its own GT and prototype rules aimed at providing cheaper, lower-cost racing for independent teams. Grand Am&#x27;s Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge, a support series for the Rolex Series, provides a similar series to the old Trans Am Series, mixing conventional sports cars and touring cars. Due to Grand Am&#x27;s affiliation with NASCAR, many NASCAR drivers occasionally participate in the Rolex Sports Car Series. Max Papis is a notable example in that he was a road racer prior to his tenure in the Sprint Cup Series. Many of these drivers only participate in the 24 Hours of Daytona.

The original Trans-Am Series dissolved in 2006, but returned to action in 2009 with tube frame TA1 and TA2 divisions racing with production-based TA3-American and TA3-International divisions. In addition, the SCCA continues to provide a major support series for Trans-Am. This series, known as the SCCA World Challenge, consists of a one-hour race for each round, combining three classes: GT (Chevrolet Corvette, Aston Martin DB9, etc.), &quot;GTS&quot; (Acura TSX, BMW 3 Series, etc.; replaced the former touring car class), and Touring Car (a &quot;showroom stock&quot; class similar to Grand Am&#x27;s Continental Challenge). The Trans Am series returned in 2009, but has yet to establish a television contract.

===2010s – Reformatting===

The 2010s have seen a major overhaul of sports car racing in the United States. The Pirelli World Challenge reformatted in 2010 to have a showroom stock touring car group comparable to that of the Continental Challenge&#x27;s Grand Sport class, promoting its other touring car class to &quot;GTS&quot;. This came after several years of the old TC class being an Acura-BMW-Mazda affair. For 2012, the series adopted a &quot;B-spec&quot; touring car class comparable to that of the Continental Challenge&#x27;s Street Tuner class.

2010 also saw the introduction of the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup (ILMC) by the ACO, featuring events in America, Asia and Europe. This in turn led the ACO &amp; FIA to come together to create the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) starting in 2012. This new series replaced the ILMC and was a spiritual successor to the former FIA World Sportscar Championship. 

In 2012, the Rolex Sports Car Series overhauled its Daytona Prototype class, allowing for production-based designs. 

The ALMS&#x27;s new LMP/LMC format, however, has not held up. The prototype classes split again in 2011, with LMP1 having three cars and LMP2 having one. A new &quot;GT Pro Am&quot; class was added. Initially, this format was only to be used in endurance races, but was eventually applied to all races. For 2012, only a handful of LMPs are being entered, with almost all of them being powered by Japanese manufacturers (Nissan, Honda, etc.). The British manufacturer Morgan has entered a Judd-powered LMP. Aston Martin Racing, who for several years had entered an LMP, has returned to GT for 2012.

The reformatted Trans-Am Series remained stagnant, being heavily overshadowed by the SCCA&#x27;s World Challenge, and failing to garner a television contract. A major factor in this is the fact that Trans Am&#x27;s teams still use vehicles dating back to 1999. In most other series, teams tended to update their vehicles every few years or so (examples include the 2005 vs. 2010 Mustangs in the Continental Challenge and the two different generations of Mazda RX-8 in the Rolex Series).

Other television changes include Speed Channel losing the rights to almost every series. The World Challenge was transferred to Versus, while the ALMS was transferred to an ESPN/ABC partnership. ALMS races are shown live online with a telecast the following day (although Speed still has the rights to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which is still televised live). For 2012, some races will be televised live. Speed, having a partnership with NASCAR, still has exclusive rights to the NASCAR-owned Grand Am series.

The ALMS has now introduced &quot;GTE-PRO&quot; and &quot;GTE-AM&quot; for endurance races.

In 2014, American Le Mans Series and Rolex Sports Car Series were merged into United SportsCar Championship, with IMSA as its sanctioning body. Fox Sports 1 (successor of Speed Channel) was returned as main broadcaster of the unified series.

Daytona Prototype was replaced in 2017 by Daytona Prototype International (DPi), which based on the four ACO homologated LMP2 chassis made by Dallara, Onroak (Ligier), Oreca, and Riley-Multimatic, with brand bodywork and homologated engines. Manufacturers are asked to partner with a privateer team, and each car will sport manufacturer bodywork, corresponding to their brand-identity. These rules are made to both control costs and attract manufacturers to the series.

In 2018, SRO Motorsports Group has taken over the management of Pirelli World Challenge, with USAC as its sanctioning body since 2017.

Beginning in 2019, NBC Sports will be replacing Fox Sports as main broadcaster of WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with six-year broadcasting rights.

==Types of cars==
There are many kinds of sports cars that compete, but they can be broadly broken down into two main categories: Sports prototypes and Grand Touring (GT) cars. These two categories (or &quot;classes&quot;) are often mixed together in a single race, such as in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In mixed-class races, an overall winner is awarded, though individual class winners are often recognised as well.

===Sports prototype===

Sports prototype is the name given to a type of car used in sports car racing and is effectively the next automotive design and technological step-up from road-going sports cars and are, along with open-wheel cars, the pinnacle of racing car design.

The highest level in sports car racing, these cars are purpose-built racing cars with enclosed wheels, and either open or closed cockpits. Ever since the World Sportscar Championship was conceived, there have been various regulations regarding bodywork, engine style and size, tyres and aerodynamics to which these cars must be built. Sports prototypes may be (and often are) one-of-a-kind machines, and need bear no relation to any road-going vehicle, although during the 1990s, some manufacturers exploited a loophole in the FIA and ACO rules. As a result, some cars racing in the GT category did pass as true sports prototypes, in turn leading to some road-going versions for homologation purposes. The Dauer-Porsche 962LM, Porsche 911 GT1-98, Mercedes CLK-GTR and Toyota GT-One were prime examples of prototypes masquerading as GTs.

In simplistic terms, sports prototypes are two-seat racing cars with bodywork covering their wheels, and are as technically advanced and, depending on the regulations they are built to, as quick as or quicker than their single-seat counterparts. Although not widely known, sports-prototypes (along with Formula 1 cars) are responsible for introducing the most numbers of new technologies and ideas to motorsport, including rear-wings, ground effect &#x27;venturi&#x27; tunnels, fan-assisted aerodynamics and dual-shift gearboxes. Some of these technologies eventually filter down to road cars.

In the ACO regulations, two categories of sports prototypes are now recognised: P1 and P2. Cars competing in the P1 category must weigh no less than 900 kg and are limited to 6000 cc naturally aspirated and 4000 cc turbocharged engines. 5500 cc turbo-Diesel engines are also permitted in P1 – Audi scored Le Mans victories with such a car in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and Peugeot returned to racing in 2007 with a car with a similar powerplant (Peugeot 908). P2 cars can weigh much less — first 675 kg, then 750 kg and now 825 kg — but are restricted to 3400 cc V6 or V8 normally aspirated or 2000 cc turbocharged powerplants. In the European series in which endurance is a priority and P2s have been run largely by privateers, P2s have not challenged P1s for outright victories; in the American Le Mans Series with generally shorter races P2 has become the most active prototype category with serious involvement from Porsche and Acura and whereas P2 in Europe tends to involve races of attrition, in the US series the P2s, particularly the Porsche RS Spyder are often quicker round a lap than P1s, with the Porsche having scored many overall victories against the Audis in P1.

Prototype rules for 2010 and beyond will encourage production-based engines (GT1 engines in LMP1, GT2 engines in LMP2) and rules to equalise the performance of petrol and diesel LMP1s are also being addressed.

Daytona Prototypes are a product of the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, and offer a different interpretation of the prototype theme. DPs, as they are often called, are closed-cockpit, purpose-built racing machines which are less expensive and (deliberately) somewhat slower than Le Mans Prototypes, which were becoming dangerously quick on the Daytona oval and prohibitively expensive for smaller teams to run. Compared to the LMPs, DPs are severely limited in terms of approved technology; for instance, they are required to be constructed of steel tube frames with carbon-fibre skins, rather than being carbon-fibre monocoques, and must use production-based engines. In addition, contrary to their European counterparts who continuously alter and develop a vehicle to increase performance as a season progresses, DPs are restricted to their original conception of the car from the start of the season. For these reasons, the category being labeled as a &quot;prototype&quot; has occasionally been criticised as misleading and being more in line with traditional &quot;spec&quot; race series prevalent in the United States. The intention of the DP formula was to provide a class in which tight technical regulations encouraged close competition and where budget would be relatively unimportant. DP chassis are subject to a franchise-like approval system in which only approved constructors are eligible, with rules stability enforced for several years at a time, although this led in 2007 to established constructors like Lola and Dallara entering the 2008 series by taking over the rights of existing constructors (Multimatic and Doran respectively).

===Grand Touring car===

Grand Touring (from the Italian &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;) racing is the most common form of sports car racing, and is found all over the world, in both international and national series. Historically, Grand Touring cars had to be in series production, but in 1976 the class was split into production-based Group 4 Grand Touring Cars and Group 5 Special Production Cars, the latter of which were essentially pure-bred racing cars with production-lookalike bodies. GT racing gradually fell into abeyance in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s, with silhouette cars continuing to race in IMSA races in the USA. When GT racing revived after the collapse of the World Sports Car Championship at the end of 1992, the lead in defining rules was taken by the ACO. Under the ACO rules, Grand Touring cars are divided into two categories, Grand Touring 1 (GT1, formerly GT) and Grand Touring 2 (GT2, formerly N-GT). As the name of the class implies, the exterior of the car closely resembles that of the production version, while the internal fittings may differ greatly. GT2 cars are very similar to the FIA GT2 classification, and are considered &#x27;pure&#x27; GT cars; that is production exotic cars with relatively few internal modifications for racing. The Porsche 911 is currently the most popular car in the GT2 class. 2009 will be the last run of the GT1 class as a result of budgeting issues. GT1 teams are currently enlisting to run their cars in the GT2 class next year. The American Le Mans Series also runs a &quot;GT-Challenge&quot; class, which currently only uses Porsche 911 GT3 Cups but will open to other cars next year. This category is designed for privateer and rookie teams as an easier way to enter the series.

For 2011, the ACO split GT2 into two categories, GTE-Pro (for all-professional teams with current-spec cars) and GTE-Am (for teams with one amateur and one professional per car using previous-spec cars), as a way to entice rookies to enter one of the three Le Mans Series.

FIA divides GT cars into four categories called GT1 (formerly GT), GT2 (formerly N-GT), GT3 (recently introduced) and GT4. The GT1 and GT2 divisions are very close to the ACO rules outlined above, and again some crossover racing does occur, particularly in the GT2 class. The GT3 class is relatively new and was introduced for 2006. These cars are closer to standard form than in GT2, and in most cases modifications are restricted to those found in one-make cups. GT4 is another new category for amateur and semi-pro drivers in production-based cars with very few racing modifications – for example, no aerodynamic aids or body modifications are permitted. All of the categories (with the exception of GT2) have their own championships/cups run by the FIA. Currently, GT2 is defunct in the FIA, and only runs in Le Mans Series/ALMS; however, the FIA has also announced that GT2 cars will be able to compete in the FIA GT1 World Championship in 2012 in a World Class along with GT3 cars.

Grand-Am has only one class for Grand Touring cars which allows production-based GT racers at a spec somewhere between FIA GT2 and GT3 in terms of modification (e.g. the Porsche 911 GT3 Cup) to compete with purpose-built tube-frame &quot;silhouette&quot; machines reminiscent of the former IMSA GTO/GTU classes. Grand-Am also runs various under-classes more reminiscent of GT4, though closer to factory cars. For 2012, GT3 cars will be allowed, with spec wings and splitters, as long as they pass a test at the NASCAR Research and Development Center in Concord, North Carolina, thus allowing GT3 cars to run with few modifications relative to other series (NASCAR, the parent company of Grand-Am, does not permit anti-lock brakes or traction control to be used on Grand-Am GT cars).

, the four GT categories are in mixed health. GT1 has been all but phased out with the removal of the class from the FIA GT1 World Championship in favor of GT3 cars, in turn leading to the outright discontinuation of the series. GT2 is currently limited to certain series, including the IMSA SportsCar Championship, European Le Mans Series, FIA World Endurance Championship, Asian Le Mans Series, and the International GT Open. GT3, which has since emerged as the most popular of the GT classes, has seen widespread use in many international and regional series such as the FIA GT3 European Championship and the Blancpain Endurance Series, as well as most national series such as Germany&#x27;s ADAC GT Masters and the British GT Championship. GT4 has likely been phased out like GT1, with the removal of the category from the Blancpain Endurance Series and the cancellation of the GT4 European Cup for 2012 due to issues regarding the organiser.

====Technology escalation and control====
While GT cars are at least in theory based on road-going models, some GT1 cars in the mid to late 1990s were effectively purpose-built sports-prototypes which spawned exotic production cars with homologation production limits of 25 cars (for small-scale manufacturers, such as Saleen) or 100 cars (for major manufacturers like Daimler AG).

The original form of GT1 racing was intended for the purebred supercars and purpose-built race cars. Examples include the McLaren F1 GTR, Ferrari F40, Porsche 911 GT1, Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR, Toyota GT-One and Nissan R390 – while the first two were a derivatives of road-going sports cars, the German and Japanese contenders were pure-bred racing cars – virtually sports prototypes. Rising costs coupled with declining entries led to the death of this class in 1998, and it was replaced by what was then called GT2 (by the FIA, which later evolved into the GT1) and Le Mans Prototype (LMP, by the ACO).

This process was repeated in 2009 in response to cost increases in GT1 and GT2 racing, resulting in the abolition of both GT classes as they stood. Various proposals exist to control technology and costs, mainly by discontinuing the existing GT1 class and creating new class boundaries between current GT2, GT3 and GT4 cars.

===Other divisions===
Sports car racing in general extends far beyond ACO and FIA rules, encompassing the Grand-Am professional series as well as amateur road racing classes in the Sports Car Club of America in North America.

Amateur sports car racing throughout the United States is sanctioned by clubs such as the Sports Car Club of America. The SCCA&#x27;s sports-racing classes include C and D Sports Racing, Sports 2000 and Spec Racer Ford, in descending order of speed and sophistication, as well as a number of production-based and one-make classes.

In Japan, the Super GT series divides cars into two classes, called GT500 and GT300. These cars are less restricted than their European and American counterparts, with cars often sporting tube frame clips and forced induction kits. Teams are also free to change engines with other models made by the manufacturer. The numbers in the classifications refer to the maximum power (in horsepower) available to each class; this is achieved through the use of engine restrictors. Proponents of the series claim that the Super GT cars are the fastest sports cars in the world, while critics deride the cars as being outside the limits of &#x27;acceptable&#x27; modifications. In recent years however, rule changes in both GT500 and GT1 (aimed at eventually allowing both classes to compete with each other in the future) have brought the cars closer to each other, although GT500 cars still have a notable advantage in terms of aerodynamics and cornering performance (enough to compensate for GT1 cars greater power).

In Europe, although most national championships (British, French, German and the Spain-based International GT Open) run under FIA/ACO GT regulations with some modifications to ensure a more balanced competition and lower costs, some championships are open to non-homologated GT cars. The Belcar series in Belgium allows silhouettes and touring cars to race alongside GTs, while the VdeV Modern Endurance allows small prototypes from national championships such as the Norma, Centenari and Radical to race alongside GT3-class cars. Britcar permits a wide range of touring and GT cars to compete in endurance races, and Britsports permits various kinds of sports racing cars.

==Notable racing series==
===World championships===
====Current====
*FIA World Endurance Championship – In operation since 2012, the current auto racing World Championship for both Sports prototypes and GT cars organised by the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest (ACO) and sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA). The championship is considered a revival of the defunct World Sportscar Championship which ended in 1992. In 2012-2016 seasons the &quot;World Cup for GT Manufacturer&quot; was awarded to a winning manufacturer of GT cars, promoted to the &quot;World GT Manufacturers&#x27; Championship&quot; title since the 2017 season.

====Former====
*World Sportscar Championship – The first sports car racing world series run from 1953 to 1992. Originally contested by Sports prototypes, GT cars and even Touring cars, towards its end it was restricted to Sports prototypes only. At various times, it was known as the World Sportscar Championship, International Championship for GT Manufacturers, International Sports Car Championship, International Championship for Makes, World Championship for Makes, World Endurance Championship and World Sports Prototype Championship. In 1953-1984 seasons titles were awarded to &quot;manufacturers&quot; of sports cars belonging to two main categories: Sports prototype (except of the 1978-1981 seasons) and GT car (except of the 1953-1961 and 1982 seasons). In 1985-1992 seasons titles were awarded only to &quot;teams&quot; entering Sports prototypes (instead of &quot;manufacturers&quot; of Sports prototypes), excluding &quot;teams&quot; entering GT cars.
*FIA GT1 World Championship – A short-lived series for GT cars run from 2010 to 2012, created by Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) in an attempt to promote the FIA GT Championship to World Championship status.

===International championships===
*Porsche Supercup – One-make series for Porsche Carrera Cup cars, serving as a support series for the Formula One world championship. Predominantly European series, but has since also ventured into western Asia.

<doc id="52245" wikidata="Q7856" url="?curid=52245" title="Rallying">
<text>Rallying is a wide-ranging form of motorsport with various competitive motoring elements such as speed tests (sometimes called &quot;rally racing&quot; in United States), navigation tests, or the ability to reach waypoints or a destination at a prescribed time or average speed. Rallies may be short in the form of trials at a single venue, or several thousand miles long in an extreme endurance rally.

Depending on the format, rallies may be organised on private or public roads, open or closed to traffic, or off-road in the form of cross country or rally-raid. Competitors can use production vehicles which must be road-legal if being used on open roads or specially built competition vehicles suited to crossing specific terrain.

In most cases rallying distinguishes itself from other forms of motorsport by not running directly against other competitors over laps of a circuit, but instead in a point-to-point format in which participants leave at regular intervals from one or more start points.

== Rally types ==
Rallies generally fall under two categories, road rallies and cross-country (off-road). Different types of rally are described however a rally may be a mix of types.

=== Road rallies ===
Road rallies are the original form held on public highways open to traffic. In its annually published International Sporting Code, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) includes the following definition of rally:

==== Regularity rally ====
In an exclusively regularity rally, the aim is to adhere to the itinerary by following the route and arriving and departing at checkpoints at the prescribed time, with penalties applied to entrants who arrive early, late or who deviate from the route. The entrants with the fewest penalties at the end of the rally are the winners. In trying to maintain the set average speed/s, the reliability of the vehicle, and the ability of the crew to drive, navigate and follow the itinerary is tested. Most non-regularity rally itineraries follow this base structure even where driving tests or special stages are used, however these would not then be described as a regularity rally.

==== Time-Speed-Distance (TSD rally) ====
Similar to a regularity rally, the itinerary may advise a time and/or distance, or may only advise a target average speed with no indication where the checkpoints may be.

==== Navigational rally ====
The ability of the crew to follow road signs or directions of varying depth of information is tested.

==== Gimmick rallies ====
Gimmick rallies have less of a concern on timekeeping or driving ability and include other fun and games. Examples include:

* Monte-Carlo styles (Monte Carlo, Pan Am, Pan Carlo, Continental)
* logic
* observation
* treasure hunts

These rallies are primarily amateur events.Stage rallying simply divides the route from the start to the finish of any rally into stages, not necessarily exclusively for speed tests on &quot;special stages&quot;. Each stage may have different targets or rules attached. In the FIA ecoRally Cup for example, energy performance is measured on regularity stages ran in conformity with the clock. A gimmick rally may have stages with varying difficulty of the puzzle element.

==== Speed competitions ====
Road rallies must use special stages where speed is used to determine the classification of the rally&#x27;s competitors; the quickest time to complete the special stages wins the rally. These are sections of road closed to traffic and authorised to be used for speed tests. Special stages are linked by open roads where navigation, timekeeping, and road traffic law rules must be followed. These open road sections are sometimes called transport stages, somewhat complementing special stages in the make-up of a stage rally. These are the most common format of professional and commercial rallies and rally championships. The FIA organises the World Rally Championship, Regional Rally Championships; and many countries&#x27; motorsport governing bodies organise domestic rallying championships using speed competitions. The stages may vary from flat asphalt and mountain passes to rough forest tracks, from ice and snow to desert sand, each chosen to provide a challenge for the crew and a test of the car&#x27;s performance and reliability. A single-venue rally takes place without the need for public road sections though the format and rules remain.

In the wake of the ever more advanced rally cars of the late 20th and 21st century is a trend towards historic rallying (also known as classic rallying), in which older cars can continue to rally. Historic rallies are usually regularity rallies with no speed tests arranged. This discipline attracts some former professional drivers back into the sport. Other drivers started their competition careers in historic rallying.

=== Cross-country rallies ===

Also commonly known by its types rally-raid or baja; cross-country rallies take place mostly off-road using similar competitive elements to road and special stage rallying competitions. When off-road, waypoints and markers are set using GPS systems, although competitors cannot use GPS for navigation. Crews must choose how best to cross the terrain to the next waypoint whilst respecting the navigational instructions provided in the roadbook. The challenge is mostly navigational and endurance. The World Rally-Raid Championship was inaugurated in 2022, including the annual Dakar Rally in its calendar, with joint sanctioning by the FIA and FIM.

==== Hill Rally ====
Hill rallies are a type of cross-country event found in the United Kingdom and defined and governed by Motorsport UK.

=== Touring assembly ===
Assemblies of car enthusiasts and their vehicles may still colloquially be called rallies, even if they involve merely the task of getting to the location (often on a trailer). However, static assemblies that simply &#x27;meet&#x27; (akin to a caravan or steam rally) are not considered a form of motorsport. A touring assembly may have an organised route and simple passage controls but not any form of competition held or prizes given. One example, the Gumball 3000, which calls itself &quot;&#x27;a rally not a race&quot;&#x27;, explicitly states in its terms that no form of competition between participants must take place. The FIA defined this activity under &#x27;rally of the touring kind&#x27; at least until 2007, though have now separated the term &#x27;Touring Assembly&#x27; without using the word rally in its definition.

=== Rally derivatives and relatives ===

==== Trials ====
* Hillclimbing: Though not a form of rally, hillclimbing could be described in related terms as one special stage that climbs a hill. Cars start at intervals from one start point to one finish point. This discipline allows for many types of vehicles including single-seaters and can be arranged at one venue.
* Autocross: Similar to hillclimbing, cars also start at intervals and are timed to complete a course, usually temporary and marked out with cones with the intent of demanding good car handling rather than speed. Cars can be single-seaters with roll cages used in crosskart racing.
* Rallysprint: Very condensed form of trials-type driving with no particular global definition. Usually run with touring cars at single venues or a single stage without road sections, co-drivers or itineraries, and competitors may even switch cars depending on the agreed rules of competition.
* Gymkhana/Autoslalom: Similar to autocross but with very precise and extravagant handling requirements such as donuts and drifting.

==== Racing ====
*Rallycross: Created for a British TV programme in 1967 where rally drivers were allowed to directly compete in groups of four in short sprint races on a circuit. Rallycross has grown to have FIA World and European Championships with specifically developed cars that out-power standard rally cars.
* Formula Rally: Originating as part of the &quot;Bologna Motor Show&quot; in Italy, in December 1985, was a show race of rally drivers in an arena occupied by around 50,000 spectators, a &quot;Mickey Mouse Course&quot; had been created, on which two players (starting from different starting places) competed for the overall victory in the final through a &quot;knock-out system&quot; over preliminary rounds, quarter-finals and semi-finals. Formula Rally is practiced mostly in Italy and Germany.
* Ice Racing: The &quot;ice races&quot; of the &quot;Andros Trophy&quot;, run in France, have their roots in rallying. As early as the 1970s, car ice races were contested in the French Maritime Alps in the winter sports centres of Chamonix &quot;(24h sur Glace de Chamonix)&quot; and Serre Chevalier with rally cars that were still relatively tame at the time. Later, the participants developed far more efficient vehicles for this purpose; for the &quot;Andros trophy&quot; almost exclusively very potent prototypes with all-wheel drive and synchronous steering of the front and rear wheels.
* Enduro: A similar, but not identical sporting form to rally for motorcycles.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The word &#x27;rally&#x27; comes from the French verb &quot;&#x27;rallier&quot;&#x27;, meaning to reunite or regroup urgently during a battle. It was in use since at least the seventeenth century and continues to mean to synergise with haste for a purpose. By the time of the invention of the motor car, it was in use as a noun to define the organised mass gathering of people, not to protest or demonstrate, but to promote or celebrate a social, political or religious cause. Motor car rallies were probably being arranged as motor clubs and automobile associations were beginning to form shortly after the first motor cars were being produced.

&quot;Auto Rallies&quot; were common events in the USA in the early twentieth century for the purpose of political caucusing, however many of these rallies were coincidentally aimed at motorists who could attend in convenient fashion rather than being a motoring rally. One early example of a true motor rally, the 1909 Auto Rally Day in Denison, Iowa, United States, gathered approximately 100 vehicles owned by local residents for no other real reason than to give rides to members of the public, using fuel paid for by local businessmen who hoped the event would help sell cars.

In the case of the 1910 Good Roads Rally held in Charleston, South Carolina, a rally was organised to promote the need for better roads. The rally itself had no competition and most vehicles were expected to be parked for its duration. The programme included a visit to some ongoing roadworks, a vehicle parade, with food, drink, dancing and music also arranged. However, the Automobile Club of Columbia, who had members attending the event, independently organised their own road competition to contest on the journey between the two cities. A prize of $10 was awarded to the motorist &quot;approximating the most ideal schedule&quot; between two secret points along the route and who had &quot;the most nearly correct idea of a pleasant and sensible pleasure tour&quot; between the two cities. Though this format of competition itself would later become known as a regularity &#x27;rally&#x27;, it wasn&#x27;t at the time, however the trophy and prize were awarded at the rally.

The first known use of the word rally to include a road competition was the 1911 Monaco Rally (later Monte Carlo Rally). It was organised by a group of wealthy locals who formed the &quot;Sport Automobile Vélocipédique Monégasque&quot; and bankrolled by the &quot;Société des Bains de Mer&quot; (the &quot;sea bathing company&quot;), the operators of the famous casino who were keen to attract wealthy and adventurous motorists to their &#x27;rallying point&#x27;. Competitors could start at various locations but with a speed limit of 25kph imposed, the competitive elements were partly based on cleanliness, condition and elegance of the cars and required a jury to choose a winner. However, getting to Monaco in winter was a challenge in itself. A second event was held in 1912.

=== Rallying as road competitions ===

==== Origins of motorsport ====
Rallying as a form of road competition can be traced back to the origins of motorsport, including the world&#x27;s first known motor race; the 1894 Paris–Rouen Horseless Carriage Competition (&quot;Concours des Voitures sans Chevaux&quot;). Sponsored by a Paris newspaper, &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, it attracted considerable public interest and entries from leading manufacturers. The official winner was Albert Lemaître driving a 3 hp Peugeot, although the &quot;Comte&quot; de Dion had finished first but his steam-powered vehicle was ineligible for the official competition.

The event led to a period of city-to-city road races being organised in Europe and the USA, which introduced many of the features found in later rallies: individual start times with cars running against the clock rather than head to head; time controls at the entry and exit points of towns along the way; road books and route notes; and driving over long distances on ordinary, mainly gravel, roads, facing hazards such as dust, traffic, pedestrians and farm animals.

From 24 September-3 October 1895, the &quot;Automobile Club de France&quot; sponsored the longest race to date, a event from Bordeaux to Agen and back. Because it was held in ten stages, it can be considered the first stage rally. The first three places were taken by a Panhard, a Panhard, and a three-wheeler De Dion-Bouton.

In the Paris–Madrid race of May 1903, the Mors of Fernand Gabriel took just under five and a quarter hours for the to Bordeaux, an average of 105 km/h (65.3 mph). Speeds had now exceeded the safe limits of dusty highways thronged with spectators and open to other traffic, people and animals and there were numerous crashes, many injuries and eight deaths. The French government stopped the race and banned this style of event. From then on, racing in Europe (apart from Italy) would be on closed circuits, initially on long loops of public highway and then, in 1907, on the first purpose-built track, England&#x27;s Brooklands.

Italy had been running road competitions since 1895, when a reliability trial was run from Turin to Asti and back. The country&#x27;s first true motor race was held in 1897 along the shore of Lake Maggiore, from Arona to Stresa and back. This led to a long tradition of road racing, including events like Sicily&#x27;s Targa Florio (from 1906) and &quot;Giro di Sicilia&quot; (Tour of Sicily, 1914), which went right round the island, both of which continued on and off until after World War II. The first Alpine event was held in 1898, the Austrian Touring Club&#x27;s three-day Automobile Run through South Tyrol, which included the infamous Stelvio Pass.

In Britain, the legal maximum speed of precluded road racing, but in April and May 1900, the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland (the forerunner of the Royal Automobile Club) organised the Thousand Mile Trial, a 15-day event linking Britain&#x27;s major cities in order to promote this novel form of transport. Seventy vehicles took part, the majority of them trade entries. They had to complete thirteen stages of route varying in length from at average speeds of up to the legal limit of , and tackle six hillclimb or speed tests. On rest days and at lunch halts, the cars were shown to the public in exhibition halls. This event was followed in 1901 by a five-day trial based in Glasgow The Scottish Automobile Club organised an annual Glasgow–London non-stop trial from 1902 to 1904, then the Scottish Reliability Trial from 1905. The Motor Cycling Club allowed cars to enter its trials and runs from 1904 (London–Edinburgh, London–Land&#x27;s End, London–Exeter). In 1908 the Royal Automobile Club held its International Touring Car Trial, and in 1914 the Light Car Trial for manufacturers of cars up to 1400 cc, to test comparative performances. In 1924, the exercise was repeated as the Small Car Trials.

In Germany, the Herkomer Trophy was first held in 1905, and again in 1906. This challenging five-day event attracted over 100 entrants to tackle its road section, a hillclimb and a speed trial, but it was marred by poor organisation and confusing regulations. One participant had been Prince Henry of Austria, who with the Imperial Automobile Club of Germany, later created the first &quot;Prinz Heinrich Fahrt&quot; (Prince Henry Trial) in 1908. Another trial was held in 1910. These were very successful, attracting top drivers and works cars from major teams – several manufacturers added &quot;Prince Henry&quot; models to their ranges. The first Alpine Trial was held in 1909, in Austria, and by 1914 this was the toughest event of its kind, producing a star performance from Britain&#x27;s James Radley in his Rolls-Royce Alpine Eagle.

In Estonia and Latvia, The Last Race of the Empire was held in the days prior to the outbreak of World War 1 in 1914. This period was later called the July Crisis. A 706 mile car race of six stages through what is now Estonia and Latvia. The race was the third Baltic Automobile and Aero Club competition for the Grand Duchess Victoria Feodrovna Prize. The participants were mainly of Tsarist Russian and German Nobility.

Two ultra-long distance challenges took place at this time. The Peking-Paris of 1907 was not officially a competition, but a &quot;raid&quot;, the French term for an expedition or collective endeavour whose promoters, the newspaper &quot;Le Matin&quot;, rather optimistically expected participants to help each other; it was &#x27;won&#x27; by Prince Scipione Borghese, Luigi Barzini, and Ettore Guizzardi in an Itala. The New York–Paris of the following year, which went via Japan and Siberia, was won by George Schuster and others in a Thomas Flyer. Each event attracted only a handful of adventurous souls, but in both cases the successful drivers exhibited characteristics modern rally drivers would recognise: meticulous preparation, mechanical skill, resourcefulness, perseverance and a certain single-minded ruthlessness. Rather gentler (and more akin to modern rallying) was the Glidden Tour, run by the American Automobile Association between 1902 and 1913, which had timed legs between control points and a marking system to determine the winners.

==== Interwar years ====

The First World War brought a lull to motorsport. The Monte Carlo Rally was not revived until 1924, but since then, apart from World War II and its aftermath, it has been an annual event and remains a regular round of the World Rally Championship. In the 1930s, helped by the tough winters, it became the premier European rally, attracting 300 or more participants.

In the 1920s, numerous variations on the Alpine theme sprang up in Austria, Italy, France, Switzerland and Germany. The most important of these were Austria&#x27;s &quot;Alpenfahrt&quot;, which continued into its 44th edition in 1973, Italy&#x27;s &quot;Coppa delle Alpi&quot;, and the &quot;Coupe Internationale des Alpes&quot; (International Alpine Trial), organised jointly by the automobile clubs of Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and, latterly, France. This last event, run from 1928 to 1936, attracted strong international fields vying for an individual Glacier Cup or a team Alpine Cup, including successful Talbot, Riley, MG and Triumph teams from Britain and increasingly strong and well funded works representation from Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Germany, keen to prove its engineering and sporting prowess with successful marques like Adler, Wanderer and Trumpf.

The French started their own &quot;Rallye des Alpes Françaises&quot; in 1932, which continued after World War II as the &quot;Rallye International des Alpes&quot;, the name often shortened to &quot;Coupe des Alpes&quot;. Other rallies started between the wars included Britain&#x27;s RAC Rally (1932) and Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Liège-Rome-Liège&quot; or just Liège, officially called &quot;Le Marathon de la Route&quot; (1931), two events of radically different character; the former a gentle tour between cities from various start points, &quot;rallying&quot; at a seaside resort with a series of manoeuvrability and car control tests; the latter a thinly disguised road race over some of Europe&#x27;s toughest mountain roads.

In Ireland, the first &quot;Ulster Motor Rally&quot; (1931) was run from multiple starting points. After several years in this format, it transitioned into the Circuit of Ireland Rally. In Italy, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s government encouraged motorsport of all kinds and facilitated road racing, so the sport quickly restarted after World War I. In 1927 the &quot;Mille Miglia&quot; (Thousand Mile) was founded, run over a loop of highways from Brescia to Rome and back. It continued in this form until 1938.

The Liège of August 1939 was the last major event before World War II. Belgium&#x27;s Jean Trasenster (Bugatti) and France&#x27;s Jean Trevoux (Hotchkiss) tied for first place, denying the German works teams shortly before their countries were overrun. This was one of five Liège wins for Trasenster; Trevoux won four Montes between 1934 and 1951.

==== Post-World War II years ====
===== Europe =====
Rallying was again slow to get under way after a major war, but by the 1950s there were many long-distance road rallies. In Europe, the Monte Carlo Rally, the French and Austrian Alpines, and the Liège were joined by a host of new events that quickly established themselves as classics: the Lisbon Rally (Portugal, 1947), the Tulip Rally (the Netherlands, 1949), the Rally to the Midnight Sun (Sweden, 1951, now the Swedish Rally), the Rally of the 1000 Lakes (Finland, 1951 – now the Rally Finland), and the Acropolis Rally (Greece, 1956). The RAC Rally gained International status on its return in 1951, but for 10 years its emphasis on map-reading navigation and short manoeuvrability tests made it unpopular with foreign crews. The &quot;FIA&quot; created in 1953 a European Rally Championship (at first called the &quot;Touring Championship&quot;) of eleven events; it was first won by Helmut Polensky of Germany. This was the premier international rallying championship until 1973, when the FIA created the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers.

Initially, most of the major post-war rallies were fairly gentlemanly, but the organisers of the French Alpine and the Liège (which moved its turning point from Rome into Yugoslavia in 1956) straight away set difficult time schedules: the &quot;Automobile Club de Marseille et Provence&quot; laid on a long tough route over a succession of rugged passes, stated that cars would have to be driven flat out from start to finish, and gave a coveted &quot;Coupe des Alpes&quot; (&quot;Alpine Cup&quot;) to anyone achieving an unpenalised run; while Belgium&#x27;s Royal Motor Union made clear no car was expected to finish the Liège unpenalised – when one did (1951 winner Johnny Claes in a Jaguar XK120) they tightened the timing to make sure it never happened again. These two events became the ones for &quot;the men&quot; to do. The Monte, because of its glamour, got the media coverage and the biggest entries (and in snowy years was also a genuine challenge); while the Acropolis took advantage of Greece&#x27;s appalling roads to become a truly tough event. In 1956 came Corsica&#x27;s &quot;Tour de Corse&quot;, 24 hours of virtually non-stop flat out driving on some of the narrowest and twistiest mountain roads on the planet – the first major rally to be won by a woman, Belgium&#x27;s Gilberte Thirion, in a Renault Dauphine.

These events were road races in all but name, but in Italy such races were still allowed, and the &quot;Mille Miglia&quot; continued until a serious accident in 1957 caused it to be banned. Meanwhile, in 1981, the &quot;Tour de France&quot; was revived by the Automobile-Club de Nice as a different kind of rally, based primarily on a series of races at circuits and hillclimbs around the country. It was successful for a while and continued until 1986. It spawned similar events in a few other countries, but none survive.

===== South America =====
In countries where there was no shortage of demanding roads across remote terrain, other events sprang up. In South America, the biggest of these took the form of long distance city to city races, each around , divided into daily legs. The first was the &quot;Gran Premio del Norte&quot; of 1940, run from Buenos Aires to Lima and back; it was won by Juan Manuel Fangio in a much modified Chevrolet coupé. This event was repeated in 1947, and in 1948 an even more ambitious one was held, the &quot;Gran Premio de la América del Sur&quot; from Buenos Aires to Caracas, Venezuela—Fangio had an accident in which his co-driver was killed. Then in 1950 came the fast and dangerous Carrera Panamericana, a road race in stages across Mexico to celebrate the opening of the asphalt highway between the Guatemala and United States borders, which ran until 1954. All these events fell victim to the cost – financial, social and environmental – of putting them on in an increasingly complex and developed world, although smaller road races continued long after, and a few still do in countries like Bolivia.
===== Africa =====
In Africa, 1950 saw the first French-run Algiers-Cape Town Rally, a rally from the Mediterranean to South Africa; it was run on and off until 1961, when the new political situation hastened its demise. In 1953 East Africa saw the demanding Coronation Safari, which went on to become the Safari Rally and a World Championship round, to be followed in due course by the Rallye du Maroc and the Rallye Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. Australia&#x27;s Redex Round Australia Trial also dates from 1953, although this remained isolated from the rest of the rallying world.

===== North America =====
Canada hosted one of the world&#x27;s longest and most gruelling rallies in the 1960s, the Shell 4000 Rally. It was the only one sanctioned by the FIA in North America.

==== Intercontinental rallying ====
The quest for longer and tougher events saw the re-establishment of the intercontinental rallies beginning with the London–Sydney Marathon held in 1968. The rally trekked across Europe, the Middle-East and the sub-continent before boarding a ship in Bombay to arrive in Fremantle eight days later before the final push across Australia to Sydney. It attracted over 100 crews including a number of works teams and top drivers; it was won by the Hillman Hunter of Andrew Cowan/Brian Coyle/Colin Malkin. The huge success of this event saw the creation of the World Cup Rallies, linked to Association Football&#x27;s FIFA World Cup. The first was the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally which saw competitors travel from London eastwards across to Bulgaria before turning westwards on a more southerly route before boarding a ship in Lisbon. Disembarking in Rio de Janeiro the route travelled southward into Argentina before turning northwards along the western coast of South America before arriving in Mexico City. The Ford Escort of Hannu Mikkola and Gunnar Palm won. These were followed in 1974 by the London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally, and in 1977 by the Singapore Airlines London-Sydney Rally.

The 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally followed four years later. The rally travelled southwards into Africa but a navigational error saw most of the rally become lost in Algerian desert. Eventually only seven teams reached the southernmost point of the rally in Nigeria with five teams making it back to West Germany having driven all legs and only the winning team completing the full distance. This, coupled with the economic climate of the 1970s the heat went out of intercontinental rallying after a second London–Sydney Marathon in 1977. The concept was revived in 1979 for the inaugural Paris-Dakar Rally. The success of the &quot;Dakar&quot; would eventually see intercontinental rallying recognised as its own discipline; the Rally Raid.

==== Introduction of special stages ====
Rallying became very popular in Sweden and Finland in the 1950s, thanks in part to the invention there of the &quot;specialsträcka&quot; (Swedish) or &quot;erikoiskoe&quot; (Finnish), or special stage. These were shorter sections of route, usually on minor or private roads—predominantly gravel in these countries—away from habitation and traffic, which were separately timed. These provided the solution to the conflict inherent in the notion of driving as fast as possible on ordinary roads. The idea spread to other countries, albeit more slowly to the most demanding events.

The RAC Rally had formally become an International event in 1951, but Britain&#x27;s laws precluded the closure of public highways for special stages. This meant it had to rely on short manoeuvrability tests, regularity sections and night map-reading navigation to find a winner, which made it unattractive to foreign crews. In 1961, Jack Kemsley was able to persuade the Forestry Commission to open their many hundreds of miles of well surfaced and sinuous gravel roads, and the event was transformed into one of the most demanding and popular in the calendar, by 1983 having over of stage. It was later renamed Rally GB.

Rallying also took off in Spain and Portugal and by the 1960s had spread to their colonial territories in the mid-Atlantic. By the end of the 1960s events had not only begun in Madeira and the Canary Islands, but also on the far-flung Azores.

==== Modern times ====
The introduction of the special stage effectively brought rallying into its modern form. Since then, the nature of the events has evolved relatively slowly though over time, rallies have tended to become shorter in distance, but also allowing for more events to be organised. Some of the older international events have gone, replaced by others from a much wider spread of countries around the world and many more local events.

The World Rally Championship was inaugurated in 1973 at first only for manufacturers and won that first year by Alpine-Renault. Not until 1979 was there a World Rally Championship for Drivers, won by Björn Waldegård. Popular international rallies were included in the championship and professional drivers have been employed alongside amateur entrants for the entirety of its existence. In the 21st century the events began to take a common &quot;clover-leaf&quot; format instead of the touring format. A central service park would provide the base for all the teams and officials, including all overnight halts, with the special stages within reach of the service park.

=== Off road (cross country) rallying ===
In 1967, a group of American off-roaders created the Mexican 1000 rally, a tough 1,000-mile race for cars and motorcycles which ran the length of the Baja California peninsula, much of it initially over roadless desert. Which quickly gained fame as the Baja 1000, today run by the SCORE International. &quot;Baja&quot; events, relatively short cross-country rallies, now take place in a number of other countries worldwide.

In 1979, a young Frenchman, Thierry Sabine, founded an institution when he organized the first &quot;rallye-raid&quot; from Paris to Dakar, in Senegal, the event now called the Dakar Rally. From amateur beginnings it quickly became a massive commercial circus catering for cars, motorcycles and trucks, and spawned other similar events. From 2008 to 2019, it was held in South America before moving to Saudi Arabia exclusively in 2020.

== Characteristics of a rally ==

=== Itinerary ===

All rallies follow at least one itinerary, essentially a schedule of the points along the route that define the rally. A common (single) itinerary may begin and end with a ceremonial start and finish that confirm the bounds of the competition. Many rallies’ itineraries are divided into legs, usually corresponding with days on multi-day rallies dividing overnight rest periods; sections, usually between &quot;services&quot; or &quot;regroups&quot;; and stages, individual point-to-point lengths of road. A loop is often used to describe a section that begins and ends in the same place, for example from a central service park.

A time control is usually found at each point on the itinerary, a timecard is carried by the crews and handed to an official at each control point to be filled in as proof of following the itinerary correctly. As crews start each leg, section and stage at intervals (for example of two minutes), each crew will have a different due or target time to arrive at each control, with penalties applied for being too early or late.

Long rallies may include one or more service, a window of time where mechanics are permitted to repair or prepare the car. Outside these services only the driver and co-driver can work on the car, although they must still respect the timing requirements of the rally. A flexi-service allows teams to use the same group of mechanics with flexibility in the timing, for example if two cars are due to arrive at two minute intervals, the second cars&#x27; 45 minute service can be delayed whilst the first car is serviced. During overnight halts between legs cars are held in a quarantine environment called parc fermé where it is not permitted to work on the cars.

Other examples of features of an itinerary include passage controls, which ensure competitors are following the correct route but have no due time window, the timecard may be stamped or the cars may be observed by officials. Refuel, light fitting and tyre zones allow competitors to refuel, fit lights for &quot;night stages&quot; run in darkness, or exchange used tyres for new. Regroups act to gather competitors in one location and reset the time intervals which may have grown or shrunk.

A road book may be published and distributed to competitors detailing the itinerary, the route they must follow and any supplementary regulations they must follow. The route can be marked out in tulip diagrams, a form of illustrating the navigational requirements or other standard icons.

=== Special stage ===
Special stages (SS) must be used when using timing for classifying competitors in speed competitions. These stages are preceded by a time control marking the boundary of a road section and the special stage. The competitors proceed to the start line from where they begin the special stage at a prescribed time, and are timed until they cross the flying finish in motion before safely coming to a stop at the stop control which acts as a time control for the following road section and the place for the crews to find out their time of completing the stage. To avoid interruptions and hindering other competitors the road between the time control and the end of the start line zone, and between the flying finish and stop control are both considered as under parc fermé conditions, crews are not allowed to get out of their car.

A Super Special Stage runs contrary to the ordinary running of a special stage, the reasons for which should be explained in the supplementary regulations. This may be where head-to-head stages are run in a crossover loop style, or if a short asphalt city stage with donuts around hay bails is run on a gravel rally for example.

A Power Stage is used in the WRC and European Rally Championship, it is simply a nominated special stage that alone awards championship points to the fastest crews.

A Shakedown is often included in an itinerary but does not form part of the competition. Crews can do multiple passes of a special stage to practice or trial different set ups. In some championships, a Qualifying Stage may also run alongside a shakedown to determine road order, the order in which competitors will compete.

=== Recce and pacenotes ===
Pacenotes are a unique and major tool in modern special stage rallying. They provide a detailed description of the course and conditions ahead and allow the driver to form a mental image beyond the visible to be able to drive as fast as possible.

In many rallies, including those of the World Rally Championship (WRC), drivers are allowed to run on the special stages of the course before the competition begins and create their own pacenotes. This process is called reconnaissance or recce and a low maximum speed is imposed. During reconnaissance, the co-driver writes down shorthand notes on how to best drive the stage. Usually, the drivers call out the turns and road conditions for the co-drivers to write down. These pacenotes are then read aloud through an internal intercom system during the actual rally, allowing the driver to anticipate the upcoming terrain and thus take the course as fast as possible.

Other rallies provide organizer-created &quot;route notes&quot; also referred to as &quot;stage notes&quot; and disallow reconnaissance and use of custom pacenotes. These notes are usually created using a predetermined format, from which a co-driver can optionally add comments or transpose into other pacenote notations. Many North American rallies do not conduct reconnaissance but provide stage notes due to time and budget constraints.

=== Service park or bivouac ===

Though not necessary for all rallies, many road rallies have a central service park that acts as a base for servicing, scrutineering, parc fermé and playing host to Rally Headquarters, where the rally officials assemble. Service parks can also be a spectator attraction in their own right, with opportunities to meet and greet the crews and commercial outlets providing goods and services. If the rally is of the touring A to B kind there may be multiple service parks that may be very small and only used once each meaning teams carry as little as possible for simple logistics purposes. A remote service is a small service used once when there are stages far away from a central service park.

In off-road cross countries the service area and support teams may travel with the competitors along the route in a Bivouac. The word means &#x27;camp&#x27; and many participants indeed sleep in tents overnight.
== Participants ==
=== Driver ===
The driver is the person who drives the car during the rally. Regardless of the type of rally, a driver needs a driver&#x27;s license issued by a competent authority. No prior experience of rallying is necessary and a debutant can hypothetically compete with a world champion on unfamiliar roads even in speed competitions.

Unless the car is in a scheduled service, only the driver and co-driver can repair or work on the car during the rally with no external assistance allowed. Spectators assisting a crashed car is technically a breach of the rules but is usually overlooked. Driver&#x27;s and co-drivers often have to make running-repairs and have to change punctured wheels themselves.
Often, a distinction is made between so called &#x27;works&#x27; drivers and privateer drivers. The first is one who competes for a team, usually that of a manufacturer, who provides the car, parts, repairs, logistics and the support personnel. Most of the works drivers of the 1950s were amateurs, paid little or nothing, reimbursed their expenses and given bonuses for winning. Then in 1960 came arguably the first rallying superstar (and one of the first to be paid to rally full-time), Sweden&#x27;s Erik Carlsson, driving for Saab. Contrarily a privateer has to meet all the organization requirements and expenses involved in competing and usually competes for the enjoyment rather than using the sport as a means of promotion or contesting a full championship.
A &quot;specialist driver&quot; is used to describe a driver who may have the skills and aptitude to win a rally of a certain surface but not on another. In the World Rally Championship which consists of different surfaces, a tarmac specialist driver may be employed by a team for example, on only the tarmac rounds. A privateer snow specialist may only enter the snow rounds. Some examples of specialist drivers are Gilles Panizzi, who obtained several victories on asphalt in the WRC while on gravel never passed fifth place; Shekhar Mehta won five editions of the Safari Rally however he never aspired to win the world championship and the Swede Mats Jonsson achieved his only two victories in the world, in the Rally Sweden. Historically, manufacturers always used local drivers due to their experience which ensured a certain result.
Unlike in many other sports, rally has no gender barriers and everybody can compete on equal terms in this regard, although historically there were cups and trophies only for women. One of the first prominent names was that of the Brit Pat Moss, sister of F1 driver Stirling Moss, who won several rallies in her time. Later, Italy&#x27;s Antonella Mandello, Germany&#x27;s Isolde Holderies, Britain&#x27;s Louise Aitken Walker and Sweden&#x27;s Pernilla Waldridson stood out. The most notable was France&#x27;s Michèle Mouton who with co-driver, Fabrizia Pons, became the first women to achieve victories in the world championship, in addition to the championship runner-up slots in 1982. As co-pilots in addition to the aforementioned Pons, the French Michèle Espinos &quot;Biche&quot; stood out, the Swedish Tina Thörner, the Venezuelan Ana Goñi or the Austrian Ilka Minor.

=== Co-driver ===

The co-driver accompanies the driver inside the car during a &quot;rally&quot; stage and is sometimes called a navigator. The co-driver and driver may swap roles although this is uncommon. On all rallies their responsibilities are mostly organizational, assisting to ensure the route is adhered to, the correct timing of the itinerary is met, ensuring completion of the timecard and avoiding penalties for being early or late when arriving at time controls. Usually the co-driver maintains communication with the team as the rally progresses.

On special stages, the co-driver&#x27;s role is to notate pace notes during reconnaissance and recite them at the correct point the driver demands when competing. This is a skill in itself as it requires reading the notes of the unseen road ahead from a page whilst keeping track of the current location. Theoretically, the more pacenotes a co-driver can deliver gives the driver more detail of the road ahead. Incorrect pace notes called at very high speeds on blind corners or crests can easily lead to accidents.

The co-driver often exercises an important role in strategy, monitoring the state of rivals and in many cases acting as a psychologist, since they also encourage and advise the driver. The rapport between driver and co-driver must therefore be essential and it is common for a driver to change partners throughout their career if they do not feel comfortable. Perhaps for this reason it is very common to find relatives competing. Examples of this are the Panizzi brothers, who raced in France and the world championship, the Vallejo brothers in Spain or the world champion Marcus Grönholm who took his brother-in-law as co-driver during his career.

=== Team ===
A rally team is not required and can exist in various forms but is usually only found in professional or commercial speed competition rallying such as is found in the WRC where manufacturer teams are required to enter multiple cars. Commercial teams exist to provide a service to privateers. A driver, co-driver and friends volunteering to help can also be called a team.
* Team principal: The team principal is the authoritative organizer and decision maker. They are ultimately responsible for recruitment of all positions, which rallies or championships to enter, technical development and maintenance of cars, and competitive aims or targets. They are generally a position found in manufacturer teams where they will also be responsible for promotional and commercial activities. In all cases a team principal will also be responsible for the financial management.

* Engineer: The engineer helps develop the car away from a rally, tuning it to be in best form for competition. During a rally, the engineer will assist the driver with the set-up of the car such as fine-tuning the suspension, differentials, gear ratios or deciding on correct tyres. The engineer may also be a mechanic.

* Mechanic: A mechanic repairs and services the car before, after and in scheduled services during the rally. It helps to be multiskilled covering things from panel-beating to electrical diagnostics to changing oil.

* Gravel crew: Despite the name, gravel crews are only found on asphalt rallies. These crews drive the stages as late as possible before the zero car to make last minute embellishments to the pace notes on the topic of traction. This is usually from weather conditions such as ice or snow or where gravel has been brought onto the road where cars have cut corners on a previous running of the stage. The gravel crews must work fast as they often run whilst their rally crews are competing other stages making the window for communication narrow.

=== Officials ===

* Rally director: Chief organiser and assumes overall responsibility of all competitors and officials.
* Stewards: Ensure the adherence to rules and regulations and decide penalties where breaches are found.
* Clerk of the course: Administration position responsible for compiling timings, results and penalties; compiling documents and communicating notices.
* Scrutineers: Technical position ensuring cars are safe and within regulations.
* Marshals: Usually volunteer positions overseeing the route of the rally, reporting and reacting to incidents.
* Timekeeper: Found at time controls on road sections and the start and finish line of special stages.

== Vehicles ==

Auto manufacturers had entered cars in rallies, and in their forerunner and cousin events, from the very beginning. The 1894 Paris-Rouen race was mainly a competition between them, while the Thousand Mile Trial of 1900 had more trade than private entries. From the time that speed limits were introduced to the various nation&#x27;s roads, rallies became mostly about reliability than speed. As a result rallies and trials became a great proving ground for any standard production vehicle, with no real need to purposely build a rally competition car until the special stage was introduced in the 1950s.

Although there had been exceptions like the outlandish Ford V8 specials created for the 1936 Monte Carlo Rally, rallies before World War II had tended to be for standard or near-standard production cars. After the war, most competing cars were production saloons or sports cars, with only minor modifications to improve performance, handling, braking and suspension. This naturally kept costs down and allowed many more people to afford the sport using ordinary cars, compared to the rally specials used today.

=== Groups 1–4 ===
In 1954 the FIA introduced Appendix J of the International Sporting Code, classifying touring and sports production cars for use in its competitions, including the new European Rally Championship, and cars had to be homologated in order to compete. The Groups 1–9 within Appendix J changed frequently though Group 1, Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4 generally held the forms of unmodified or modified, series production touring and grand touring cars used in rallying.

As rallying grew in popularity, car companies started to introduce special models or variants for rallying, such as the British Motor Corporation&#x27;s Mini Cooper, introduced in Group 2 in 1962, and its successor the Mini Cooper S (1963), developed by the Cooper Car Company. Shortly after, Ford of Britain first hired Lotus to create a high-performance version of their Cortina family car, then in 1968 launched the Escort Twin Cam, one of the most successful rally cars of its era. Similarly, Abarth developed high performance versions of Fiats 124 roadster and 131 saloon.

Other manufacturers were not content with modifying their &#x27;bread-and-butter&#x27; cars. Renault bankrolled the small volume sports-car maker Alpine to transform their little A110 Berlinette coupé into a world-beating rally car, and hired a skilled team of drivers to pilot it. In 1974 the Lancia Stratos became the first car designed from scratch to win rallies. These makers overcame the rules of FISA (as the FIA was called at the time) by building the requisite number of these models for the road, somewhat inventing the &#x27;homologation special&#x27;.

=== Four-wheel-drive ===

In 1980, a German car maker, Audi, at that time not noted for their interest in rallying, introduced a rather large and heavy coupé version of their family saloon, installed a turbocharged 2.1 litre five-cylinder engine, and fitted it with four-wheel drive, giving birth to the Audi Quattro. International regulations had prohibited four-wheel drive in rallying, but FISA accepted that this was a genuine production car and changed the rules. The Quattro quickly became the car to beat on snow, ice or gravel; and in 1983 took Hannu Mikkola to the World Rally Championship title.

=== Groups N/A/B ===
In 1982 the FIA replaced the structure of groups in Appendix J. Rallying, with the young World Rally Championship, now allowed Group N for unmodified touring cars, Group A for modified touring cars and Group B for Grand Touring cars. The low production requirement and loose restrictions of Group B led many manufacturers to develop cars much further removed from production models, and so was created a generation of rallying supercars, of which the most radical and successful were the Peugeot 205 T16, Renault 5 Turbo and the Lancia Delta S4, with lightweight fibreglass bodies roughly the shape of the standard car tacked onto spaceframe chassis, four-wheel drive, and power outputs higher than . This particular era was not to last. On the 1986 Rallye de Portugal, four spectators were killed then two months later on the &quot;Tour de Corse&quot;, Henri Toivonen and Sergio Cresto went over the edge of a mountain road and were incinerated in the fireball that followed. FISA immediately changed the rules again: rallying after 1987 would be in Groups A and N cars, closer to the production model. One notably successful car during this period was the Group A Lancia Delta Integrale, dominating world rallying during 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 – winning six consecutive manufacturer&#x27;s world rally championship titles, a feat unbeaten as of 2022. In the 1990s Japanese manufacturers Toyota, Subaru and Mitsubishi also dominated the world rally championships.
=== Rally Specific cars ===
Groups N/A/B were not exclusively used in rallying, A and N were also used in circuit touring car racing. Beginning with the &#x27;F2 kit car&#x27; in the mid-90s, extensions to Group A and N began to emerge, these were modifications to touring production cars that made them &#x27;a standard rally car&#x27;. The World Rally Car formula, introduced to the WRC in 1997, became the flagship car in the manufacturer&#x27;s championship. This was followed by Super 1600 and Super 2000-Rally, standard formulas for lower classes.

Group R contained a full range of formulae for rally specific cars and was introduced beginning 2008. Cars ranged from budget/entry in the case of R1, to performance in R5. R-GT made provisions for grand touring cars in rallying for the first time since Group B had been banned. In 2019, the Group R ladder became the basis of a new Groups Rally, with hybrid Rally1 vehicles replacing the World Rally Car. This particular car could be built using a spaceframe chassis, another first since the banning of Group B.
=== Cross-country ===
Groups T1 and T2 codify cars used in FIA cross-country rallies. Group T5 (T4 prior to 2020) was introduced to allow support trucks to enter the rally raids in their own class. Groups T3 and T4 are reserved for side-by-side vehicles and lightweight vehicles, these differ from cars by not having notable parts such as windscreens or doors. Group T6 and Trophy truck.
=== Alternative energy ===
Since 2007 the FIA have arranged an ecoRally Cup in various forms for vehicles with alternative fuel sources or hybrid powertrains. As a regularity rally no speed tests take place meaning competitors can enter using commercially available cars, however purpose-built cars have entered in the solar powered category for example.

The car manufacturer Opel, WRC driver Hayden Paddon and a collaboration of rally team Baumschlager, Kreisel and Škoda have each built electric cars for special stage rallies in the 2020s.

In 2022 Audi entered the Dakar Rally for the first time with their electric Audi RS Q e-tron. Their later entry in the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge resulted in an overall win.

=== Historic ===

The minimum age and inclusion of a vehicle in a historic rally is at the decision of the organiser. The FIA organises two international competitions for historic rallying: the European Historic Rally Championship, composed of special stage rallies; and the Trophy for Historic Regularity Rallies. In both cases, cars must comply with their Appendix K of the International Sporting Code, which classifies historic vehicles. Many nation&#x27;s ASNs and independent organisations also arrange historic rallies and championships.

=== Any vehicle ===
As regularity rallies and touring assemblies take place on open roads without a performance requirement, a rally organiser can hypothetically allow any street legal vehicle to enter. The Wacky Rally will permit campervans, fire appliances, busses or the Batmobile for example. Banger rallies generally permit any car purchased below a given value. The Gumball 3000 is known for permitting luxury and performance cars alongside ordinary cars, vans and some unconventional vehicles.

== In popular culture ==
=== Film ===

* In February 2015, The National Film &amp; Television School in England premiered one of their graduating films called &quot;Group B&quot; directed by ex-rally driver Nick Rowland. The film, set during the last year of the Group B class of rally tells the story of a young driver having to face a difficult comeback after a &quot;long and troubled absence&quot;. The young driver is played by Scottish actor Richard Madden, and his co-driver played by Northern Irish actor Michael Smiley. The film features Group B class cars such as Ford RS200, Opel Manta and Tony Pond&#x27;s MG Metro 6R4. The stunt driving in the film has been attributed to Rally America champion David Higgins.

* A documentary revolving around the life and career of World Rally Championship driver Ott Tänak entitled &quot;Ott Tänak: The Movie&quot; was released in Estonian cinemas on April 11, 2019, and on video-on-demand on October 1, 2019. The documentary consisted of interviews with Tänak, his family, friends and colleagues within the sport interspersed with filmed and archive footage of Tänak&#x27;s previous rallies along with behind-the-scenes footage from the 2018 WRC season viewed from the Estonian driver&#x27;s perspective.

<text>Alfred Josef Ferdinand Jodl (; born Alfred Josef Baumgärtler; 10 May 1890 – 16 October 1946) was a German Army &quot;Generaloberst&quot; (the rank was equal to a four-star full general) who served as the Chief of the Operations Staff of the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; – the German Armed Forces High Command – throughout World War II.

After the war, Jodl was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity at the Allied-organized Nuremberg trials. The principal charges against him related to his signing of the criminal Commando and Commissar Orders. Found guilty on all charges, he was sentenced to death and executed in Nuremberg in 1946.

==Early life and career==

Alfred Jodl was educated at a military cadet school in Munich, from which he graduated in 1910. Ferdinand Jodl, who also became an army general, was his younger brother. He was the nephew of philosopher and psychologist Friedrich Jodl at the University of Vienna. Jodl was raised Roman Catholic but rejected the faith later in life.

From 1914 to 1916, he served with a field artillery regiment on the Western Front, being awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class for gallantry in November 1914, and for being wounded in action. In 1917, he served briefly on the Eastern Front before returning to the West as a staff officer. In 1918, he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class for gallantry in action. After the defeat of the German Empire in 1918, he continued his career as a professional soldier with the much-reduced German Army (&quot;Reichswehr&quot;). Jodl married twice: in 1913 and (after becoming a widower) in 1944.

==World War II==

Jodl&#x27;s appointment as a major in the operations branch of the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; (&#x27;Troop Office&#x27;) in the Army High Command in the last years of the Weimar Republic put him under the command of General Ludwig Beck. In September 1939, Jodl first met Adolf Hitler. During the build-up to the Second World War, Jodl was nominally assigned as commander of the 44th Division from October 1938 to August 1939 after the &quot;Anschluss&quot;.

He was chosen by Hitler to be Chief of the Operations Staff of the newly formed &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW) on 23 August 1939, just prior to the German invasion of Poland. Jodl acted as chief of staff during the invasion of Denmark and Norway. Following the Fall of France, Jodl was optimistic of Germany&#x27;s success over Britain, writing on 30 June 1940 that &quot;The final German victory over England is now only a question of time.&quot;

Jodl signed the Commissar Order of 6 June 1941 (in which Soviet political commissars were to be shot) and the Commando Order of 28 October 1942 (in which Allied commandos, including properly uniformed soldiers as well as combatants wearing civilian clothes, such as Maquis and partisans, were to be executed immediately without trial if captured behind German lines).

Jodl spent most of the war at the Wolf&#x27;s Lair, Hitler&#x27;s forward command post in East Prussia. On 1 February 1944, he was promoted to the rank of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; (&#x27;colonel general&#x27;, a four-star rank). He was among those slightly injured during the 20 July plot of 1944 against Hitler, during which he suffered a concussion.

On 6 May 1945, Jodl was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross by Grand admiral Karl Dönitz, who had succeeded Hitler on 30 April 1945 as head of Germany and its armed forces.

Following regional surrenders of German forces in Europe, Jodl was sent by Dönitz to respond to the demand for &quot;immediate, simultaneous and unconditional surrender on all fronts.&quot; Jodl signed the German Instrument of Surrender on 7 May 1945 in Reims on behalf of the OKW. The surrender to all the Allies was concluded on 8 May in Berlin. On 13 May, on the arrest of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Wilhelm Keitel, Jodl succeeded him as Chief of OKW.

==Trial and conviction==
Jodl was arrested, along with the rest of the Flensburg Government of Dönitz, by British troops on 23 May 1945 and transferred to Camp Ashcan and later put before the International Military Tribunal at the Nuremberg trials. He was accused of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The principal charges against him related to his signature of the Commando Order and the Commissar Order, both of which ordered that certain classes of prisoners of war were to be summarily executed upon capture. When confronted with the 1941 mass shootings of Soviet POWs, Jodl claimed the only prisoners shot were &quot;not those that could not, but those that did not want to walk&quot;.

Additional charges at his trial included unlawful deportation and abetting execution. Presented as evidence was his signature on an order that transferred Danish citizens, including Jews, to Nazi concentration camps. Although he denied his role in this activity of the regime, the court sustained his complicity based on the evidence it had examined, with the French judge, Henri Donnedieu de Vabres, dissenting.
His wife Luise attached herself to her husband&#x27;s defence team. Subsequently, interviewed by Gitta Sereny, researching her biography of Albert Speer, Luise alleged that in many instances the Allied prosecution made charges against Jodl based on documents that they refused to share with the defence. Jodl nevertheless proved that some of the charges made against him were untrue, such as the charge that he had helped Hitler gain control of Germany in 1933.

Jodl pleaded not guilty &quot;before God, before history and my people&quot;. Found guilty on all four charges, he was hanged at Nuremberg Prison on 16 October 1946. Jodl&#x27;s last words were reportedly &quot;I salute you, my eternal Germany&quot; ().

His remains, like those of the other nine executed men and Hermann Göring (who had killed himself prior to his scheduled execution), were cremated at Ostfriedhof and the ashes were scattered in the Wenzbach, a small tributary of the River Isar to prevent the establishment of a permanent burial site which might be enshrined by Neo-Nazis. A cross commemorating him was later added to the family grave on the Frauenchiemsee in Bavaria. In 2018, the local council ordered the cross to be removed; however, in March 2019, a Munich Court upheld Jodl&#x27;s relatives&#x27; right to maintain the family grave, while noting the family&#x27;s willingness to remove his name.

==Posthumous legal action==
On 28 February 1953, after his widow Luise sued to reclaim her pension and his estate, a West German denazification court posthumously declared Jodl not guilty of breaking international law, based on Henri Donnedieu de Vabres&#x27;s 1949 disapproval of Jodl&#x27;s conviction. This not guilty declaration was revoked by the Minister of Political Liberation for Bavaria on 3 September 1953, following objections from the United States; the consequences of the acquittal on Jodl&#x27;s estate were, however, maintained.

<text>In mathematics, the Fourier transform (FT) is an integral transform that takes a function as input and outputs another function that describes the extent to which various frequencies are present in the original function. The output of the transform is a complex-valued function of frequency. The term &quot;Fourier transform&quot; refers to both this complex-valued function and the mathematical operation. When a distinction needs to be made, the output of the operation is sometimes called the frequency domain representation of the original function. The Fourier transform is analogous to decomposing the sound of a musical chord into the intensities of its constituent pitches.

Functions that are localized in the time domain have Fourier transforms that are spread out across the frequency domain and vice versa, a phenomenon known as the uncertainty principle. The critical case for this principle is the Gaussian function, of substantial importance in probability theory and statistics as well as in the study of physical phenomena exhibiting normal distribution (e.g., diffusion). The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is another Gaussian function. Joseph Fourier introduced sine and cosine transforms (which correspond to the imaginary and real components of the modern Fourier transform) in his study of heat transfer, where Gaussian functions appear as solutions of the heat equation.

The Fourier transform can be formally defined as an improper Riemann integral, making it an integral transform, although this definition is not suitable for many applications requiring a more sophisticated integration theory. For example, many relatively simple applications use the Dirac delta function, which can be treated formally as if it were a function, but the justification requires a mathematically more sophisticated viewpoint.

The Fourier transform can also be generalized to functions of several variables on Euclidean space, sending a function of &#x27;position space&#x27; to a function of momentum (or a function of space and time to a function of 4-momentum). This idea makes the spatial Fourier transform very natural in the study of waves, as well as in quantum mechanics, where it is important to be able to represent wave solutions as functions of either position or momentum and sometimes both. In general, functions to which Fourier methods are applicable are complex-valued, and possibly vector-valued. Still further generalization is possible to functions on groups, which, besides the original Fourier transform on  or , notably includes the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT, group = ), the discrete Fourier transform (DFT, group = ) and the Fourier series or circular Fourier transform (group = , the unit circle ≈ closed finite interval with endpoints identified). The latter is routinely employed to handle periodic functions. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm for computing the DFT.

== Definition ==

The Fourier transform of a complex-valued (Lebesgue) integrable function formula_1 on the real line, is the complex valued function formula_2, defined by the integral

Evaluating the Fourier transform for all values of formula_3 produces the &quot;frequency-domain&quot; function, and it converges at all frequencies to a continuous function tending to zero at infinity. If formula_1 decays with all derivatives, i.e.,

<text>The Gujarati script (, transliterated: ) is an abugida for the Gujarati language, Kutchi language, and various other languages. It is one of the official scripts of the Indian Republic. It is a variant of the Devanagari script differentiated by the loss of the characteristic horizontal line running above the letters and by a number of modifications to some characters.

Gujarati numerical digits are also different from their Devanagari counterparts.

==Origin==
The Gujarati script () was adapted from the Nagari script to write the Gujarati language. The Gujarati language and script developed in three distinct phases — 10th to 15th century, 15th to 17th century and 17th to 19th century. The first phase is marked by use of Prakrit, Apabramsa and its variants such as Paisaci, Shauraseni, Magadhi and Maharashtri. In second phase, Old Gujarati script was in wide use. The earliest known document in the Old Gujarati script is a handwritten manuscript &quot;Adi Parva&quot; dating from 1591 to 1592, and the script first appeared in print in a 1797 advertisement. The third phase is the use of script developed for ease and fast writing. The use of &quot;shirorekhā&quot; (the topline as in Devanagari) was abandoned. Until the 19th century it was used mainly for writing letters and keeping accounts, while the Devanagari script was used for literature and academic writings. It is also known as the &quot;śarāphī&quot; (banker&#x27;s), &quot;vāṇiāśāī&quot; (merchant&#x27;s) or &quot;mahājanī&quot; (trader&#x27;s) script. This script became the basis of the modern script. Later the same script was adopted by writers of manuscripts. Jain community also promoted its use for copying religious texts by hired writers.

==Overview==

The Gujarati writing system is an abugida, in which each base consonantal character possesses an inherent vowel, that vowel being &quot;a&quot; [ə]. For postconsonantal vowels other than &quot;a&quot;, the consonant is applied with diacritics, while for non-postconsonantal vowels (initial and post-vocalic positions), there are full-formed characters. With &quot;a&quot; being the most frequent vowel, this is a convenient system in the sense that it cuts down on the width of writing.

Following out of the aforementioned property, consonants lacking a proceeding vowel may condense into the proceeding consonant, forming &quot;compound&quot; or &quot;conjunct&quot; letters. The formation of these conjuncts follows a system of rules depending on the consonants involved.

In accordance with all the other Indic scripts, Gujarati is written from left to right, and is not case-sensitive.

The Gujarati script is basically phonemic, with a few exceptions. First out of these is the written representation of non-pronounced &quot;a&quot;&#x27;s, which are of three types.
*Word-final a&#x27;s. Thus &quot;house&quot; is pronounced &quot;ghar&quot; and not &quot;ghara&quot;. The a&#x27;s remain unpronounced before postpositions and before other words in compounds: &quot;housework&quot; is &quot;gharkām&quot; and not &quot;gharakām&quot;. This non-pronunciation is not always the case with conjunct characters: &quot;friend&quot; is truly &quot;mitra&quot;.
*Naturally elided &quot;a&quot;&#x27;s through the combination of morphemes. The root &quot;pakaṛ&quot; &quot;hold&quot; when inflected as &quot;holds&quot; remains written as &quot;pakaṛe&quot; even though pronounced as &quot;pakṛe&quot;. &quot;See Gujarati phonology#ə-deletion&quot;.
*&quot;a&quot;&#x27;s whose non-pronunciation follows the above rule, but which are in single words not resultant of any actual combination. Thus &quot;rain&quot;, written as &quot;varasād&quot; but pronounced as &quot;varsād&quot;.

Secondly and most importantly, being of Sanskrit-based Devanagari, Gujarati&#x27;s script retains notations for the obsolete (short &quot;i, u&quot; vs. long &quot;ī, ū&quot;; &quot;r̥&quot;, &quot;ru&quot;; &quot;ś&quot;, &quot;ṣ&quot;), and lacks notations for innovations ( vs. ; vs. ; clear vs. murmured vowels).

Contemporary Gujarati uses English punctuation, such as the question mark, exclamation mark, comma, and full stop. Apostrophes are used for the rarely written clitic. Quotation marks are not as often used for direct quotes. The full stop replaced the traditional vertical bar, and the colon, mostly obsolete in its Sanskritic capacity (see below), follows the European usage.

===Use for Avestan===
The Zoroastrians of India, who represent one of the largest surviving Zoroastrian communities worldwide, would transcribe Avestan in Nagri script-based scripts as well as the Avestan alphabet. This is a relatively recent development first seen in the texts of Neryosang Dhaval and other Parsi Sanskritist theologians of that era, and which are roughly contemporary with the oldest surviving manuscripts in Avestan script. Today, Avestan is most commonly typeset in Gujarati script (Gujarati being the traditional language of the Indian Zoroastrians). Some Avestan letters with no corresponding symbol are synthesized with additional diacritical marks, for example, the /z/ in &quot;zaraθuštra&quot; is written with /j/ + dot below.

===Influence in Southeast Asia===
Miller (2010) presented a theory that the indigenous scripts of Sumatra (Indonesia), Sulawesi (Indonesia) and the Philippines are descended from an early form of the Gujarati script. Historical records show that Gujaratis played a major role in the archipelago, where they were manufacturers and played a key role in introducing Islam. Tomé Pires reported a presence of a thousand Gujaratis in Malacca (Malaysia) prior to 1512.

Vowels (&quot;svara&quot;), in their conventional order, are historically grouped into &quot;short&quot; (&quot;hrasva&quot;) and &quot;long&quot; (&quot;dīrgha&quot;) classes, based on the &quot;light&quot; (&quot;laghu&quot;) and &quot;heavy&quot; (&quot;guru&quot;) syllables they create in traditional verse. The historical long vowels &quot;ī&quot; and &quot;ū&quot; are no longer distinctively long in pronunciation. Only in verse do syllables containing them assume the values required by meter.

Finally, a practice of using inverted &quot;mātra&quot;s to represent English and &#x27;s has gained ground.

ર &quot;r&quot;, જ &quot;j&quot; and હ &quot;h&quot; form the irregular forms of રૂ &quot;rū&quot;, રુ &quot;ru&quot;, જી &quot;jī&quot; and હૃ &quot;hṛ&quot;.

===Consonants===
Consonants (&quot;vyañjana&quot;) are grouped in accordance with the traditional, linguistically based Sanskrit scheme of arrangement, which considers the usage and position of the tongue during their pronunciation. In sequence, these categories are: velar, palatal, retroflex, dental, labial, sonorant and fricative. Among the first five groups, which contain the stops, the ordering starts with the unaspirated voiceless, then goes on through aspirated voiceless, unaspirated voiced, and aspirated voiced, ending with the Nasal stops. Most have a Devanagari counterpart.

* Letters can take names by suffixing કાર &quot;kār&quot;. The letter ર &quot;ra&quot; is an exception; it is called રેફ &quot;reph&quot;.
* Starting with ક &quot;ka&quot; and ending with જ્ઞ &quot;jña&quot;, the order goes:
:Plosives &amp; Nasals (left to right, top to bottom) → Sonorants &amp; Sibilants (top to bottom, left to right) → Bottom box (top to bottom)
*The final two are compound characters that happen to be traditionally included in the set. They are indiscriminate as to their original constituents, and they are the same size as a single consonant character.
* Written (V)&quot;h&quot;V sets in speech result in murmured V̤(C) sets (&quot;see Gujarati phonology#Murmur&quot;). Thus (with &quot;ǐ&quot; = &quot;i&quot; or &quot;ī&quot;, and &quot;ǔ&quot; = &quot;u&quot; or &quot;ū&quot;): &quot;ha&quot; → from ; &quot;hā&quot; → from ; &quot;ahe&quot; → from ; &quot;aho&quot; → from ; &quot;ahā&quot; → from ; &quot;ahǐ&quot; → from ; &quot;ahǔ&quot; → from ; &quot;āhǐ&quot; → from ; &quot;āhǔ&quot; → from ; etc.

==Conjuncts==

As mentioned, successive consonants lacking a vowel in between them may physically join as a &#x27;conjunct&#x27;. The government of these clusters ranges from widely to narrowly applicable rules, with special exceptions within. While standardized for the most part, there are certain variations in clustering, of which the Unicode used on this page is just one scheme. The rules:

*23 out of the 36 consonants contain a vertical right stroke (ખ, ધ, ળ etc.). As first or middle fragments/members of a cluster, they lose that stroke. e.g. ત + વ = ત્વ, ણ + ઢ = ણ્ઢ, થ + થ = થ્થ.
**શ &quot;ś(a)&quot; appears as a different, simple ribbon-shaped fragment preceding વ &quot;va&quot;, ન &quot;na&quot;, ચ &quot;ca&quot; and ર &quot;ra&quot;. Thus શ્વ &quot;śva&quot;, શ્ન &quot;śna&quot;, શ્ચ &quot;śca&quot; and શ્ર &quot;śra&quot;. In the first three cases the second member appears to be squished down to accommodate શ&#x27;s ribbon fragment. In શ્ચ &quot;śca&quot; we see ચ&#x27;s Devanagari equivalent of च as the squished-down second member. See the note on ર to understand the formation of શ્ર &quot;śra&quot;.
*ર &quot;r(a)&quot;
**as a first member it takes the form of a curved upward dash above the final character or its &quot;kāno&quot;. e.g. ર્ભ &quot;rbha&quot;, ર્ભા &quot;rbhā&quot;, ર્ગ્મ &quot;rgma&quot;, ર્ગ્મા &quot;rgmā&quot;.
**as a final member
***with છ &quot;chha&quot;, ટ &quot;ṭa&quot;, ઠ &quot;ṭha&quot;, ડ &quot;ḍa&quot;, ઢ &quot;ḍha&quot; and દ &quot;da&quot;, it is two lines below the character, pointed downwards and apart. Thus છ્ર, ટ્ર, ઠ્ર, ડ્ર, ઢ્ર and દ્ર.
***elsewhere it is a diagonal stroke jutting leftwards and down. e.g. ક્ર, ગ્ર, ભ્ર. ત &quot;ta&quot; is shifted up to make ત્ર &quot;tra&quot;. And as said before, શ &quot;ś(a)&quot; is modified to શ્ર &quot;śra&quot;.
*Vertical combination of geminates &quot;ṭṭa&quot;, &quot;ṭhṭha&quot;, &quot;ḍḍa&quot; and &quot;ḍhḍha&quot;: ટ્ટ, ઠ્ઠ, ડ્ડ, ઢ્ઢ. Also, ટ્ઠ &quot;ṭṭha&quot; and ડ્ઢ &quot;ḍḍha&quot;.
*As first shown with શ્ચ &quot;śca&quot;, while Gujarati is a separate script with its own novel characters, for compounds it will often use the Devanagari versions.
**દ &quot;d(a)&quot; as द preceding ગ &quot;ga&quot;, ઘ &quot;gha&quot;, ધ &quot;dha&quot;, બ &quot;ba&quot; (as ब), ભ &quot;bha&quot;, વ &quot;va&quot;, મ &quot;ma&quot; and ર &quot;ra&quot;. The first six-second members are shrunken and hang at an angle off the bottom left corner of the preceding દ/द. Thus દ્ગ &quot;dga&quot;, દ્ઘ &quot;dgha&quot;, દ્ધ &quot;ddha&quot;, દ્બ &quot;dba&quot;, દ્ભ &quot;dbha&quot;, દ્વ &quot;dva&quot;, દ્મ &quot;dma&quot; and દ્ર &quot;dra&quot;.
**હ &quot;h(a)&quot; as ह preceding ન &quot;na&quot;, મ &quot;ma&quot;, ય &quot;ya&quot;, ર &quot;ra&quot;, વ &quot;va&quot; and ઋ &quot;ṛ&quot;. Thus હ્ન &quot;hna&quot;, હ્મ &quot;hma&quot;, હ્ય &quot;hya&quot;, હ્ર &quot;hra&quot;, હ્વ &quot;hva&quot; and હૃ &quot;hṛ&quot;.
**when ઙ &quot;ṅa&quot; and ઞ &quot;ña&quot; are first members we get second members of ક &quot;ka&quot; as क (only in certain fonts), ચ &quot;ca&quot; as च and જ &quot;ja&quot; as ज. ઙ forms compounds through vertical combination. ઞ&#x27;s strokeless fragment connects to the stroke of the second member, jutting upwards while pushing the second member down. Thus ઙ્ક &quot;ṅka&quot;, ઙ્ગ &quot;ṅga&quot;, ઙ્ઘ &quot;ṅgha&quot;, ઙ્ક્ષ &quot;ṅkṣa&quot;, ઞ્ચ &quot;ñca&quot; and ઞ્જ &quot;ñja&quot;.
*The remaining vertical stroke-less characters join by squeezing close together. e.g. ક્ય &quot;kya&quot;, જ્જ &quot;jja&quot;.
*Outstanding special forms: ન્ન &quot;nna&quot;, ત્ત &quot;tta&quot;, દ્દ &quot;dda&quot; and દ્ય &quot;dya&quot;.

The role and nature of Sanskrit must be taken into consideration to understand the occurrence of consonant clusters. The orthography of written Sanskrit was completely phonetic, and had a tradition of not separating words by spaces. Morphologically it was highly synthetic, and it had a great capacity to form large compound words. Thus clustering was highly frequent, and it is Sanskrit loanwords to the Gujarati language that are the grounds of most clusters. Gujarati, on the other hand, is more analytic, has phonetically smaller, simpler words, and has a script whose orthography is slightly imperfect (&quot;a&quot;-elision) and separates words by spaces. Thus evolved Gujarati words are less a cause for clusters. The same can be said of Gujarati&#x27;s other longstanding source of words, Persian, which also provides phonetically smaller and simpler words.

An example attesting to this general theme is that of the series of &quot;d-&quot; clusters. These are essentially Sanskrit clusters, using the original Devanagari forms. There are no cluster forms for formations such as &quot;dta&quot;, &quot;dka&quot;, etc. because such formations weren&#x27;t permitted in Sanskrit phonology anyway. They are permitted under Gujarati phonology, but are written unclustered (પદત &quot;padata&quot; &quot;position&quot;, કૂદકો &quot;kūdko&quot; &quot;leap&quot;), with patterns such as &quot;a&quot;-elision at work instead.

==Romanization==
Gujarati is romanized throughout Wikipedia in &quot;standard orientalist&quot; transcription as outlined in . Being &quot;primarily a system of transliteration from the Indian scripts, [and] based in turn upon Sanskrit&quot; (cf. IAST), these are its salient features: subscript dots for retroflex consonants; macrons for etymologically, contrastively long vowels; &quot;h&quot; denoting aspirated stops. Tildes denote nasalized vowels and underlining denotes murmured vowels.

Vowels and consonants are outlined in the tables below. Hovering the mouse cursor over them will reveal the appropriate IPA symbol. Finally, there are three Wikipedia-specific additions: &quot;f&quot; is used interchangeably with &quot;ph&quot;, representing the widespread realization of as ; &quot;â&quot; and &quot;ô&quot; for novel characters ઍ and ઑ ; &quot;ǎ&quot; for &#x27;s where elision is uncertain. See Gujarati phonology for further clarification.

==Unicode==
Gujarati script was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.

The Unicode block for Gujarati is U+0A80–U+0AFF:

<doc id="52250" wikidata="Q2973" url="?curid=52250" title="Darmstadt">
<text>Darmstadt () is a city in the state of Hesse in Germany, located in the southern part of the Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt Metropolitan Region). Darmstadt has around 160,000 inhabitants, making it the fourth largest city in the state of Hesse after Frankfurt am Main, Wiesbaden, and Kassel.

Darmstadt holds the official title &quot;City of Science&quot; () as it is a major centre of scientific institutions, universities, and high-technology companies. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the European Space Agency&#x27;s European Space Operations Centre (ESA ESOC) are located in Darmstadt, as well as GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research, where several chemical elements such as bohrium (1981), meitnerium (1982), hassium (1984), darmstadtium (1994), roentgenium (1994), and copernicium (1996) were discovered. The existence of the following elements was also confirmed at GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research: nihonium (2012), flerovium (2009), moscovium (2012), livermorium (2010), and tennessine (2012). The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) is an international accelerator facility under construction. Darmstadt is also the seat of the world&#x27;s oldest pharmaceutical company, Merck, which is the city&#x27;s largest employer.
The Mathildenhöhe, including the Darmstadt artists&#x27; colony, a major centre of the Jugendstil artistic movement, referring both to the group of artists active in the city in the late 19th and early 20th century, as well as the buildings which they designed, together with the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt, were recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2021.

Darmstadt was formerly the capital of a sovereign state, the Grand Duchy of Hesse and its successor, the People&#x27;s State of Hesse, a federal state of Germany. As the capital of an increasingly prosperous duchy, the city gained some international prominence and remains one of the wealthiest cities in Europe. In the 20th century, industry (especially chemicals), as well as large science and electronics (and later, information technology) sectors became increasingly important, and are still a major part of the city&#x27;s economy. It is also home to the football club SV Darmstadt 98. Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse), the wife of Nicholas II of Russia, as well as Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse), the wife of Alexander II of Russia, who were related, were born in this city.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The name Darmstadt first appears towards the end of the 11th century, then as &quot;Darmundestat&quot;.

Darmstadt was chartered as a city by the Holy Roman Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian in 1330, at which time it belonged to the counts of Katzenelnbogen. The city, then called &quot;Darmstait&quot;, became a secondary residence for the counts, with a small castle established at the site of the current, much larger edifice.

When the house of Katzenelnbogen became extinct in 1479, the city was passed to the Landgraviate of Hesse, and was seat of the ruling landgraves (1567–1806) and thereafter (to 1918) of the grand dukes of Hesse.

=== Industrial age ===
The city&#x27;s population grew during the 19th century, from a little over 10,000, to 72,000 inhabitants. A polytechnical school, which later became a Technical University now known as TU Darmstadt, was established in 1877.

In the early 20th century, Darmstadt was an important centre for the art movement of Jugendstil, the German variant of Art Nouveau. Also during this period, in 1912 the chemist Anton Kollisch, working for the pharmaceutical company Merck, first synthesised the chemical MDMA (ecstasy) in Darmstadt. Darmstadt&#x27;s municipal area was extended in 1937 to include the neighbouring localities of Arheilgen and Eberstadt, and in 1938 the city was separated administratively from the surrounding district (&quot;Kreis&quot;).

=== Nazi Germany ===
Darmstadt was the first city in Germany to force Jewish shops to close in early 1933, shortly after the Nazis took power in Germany. The shops were only closed for one day, for &quot;endangering communal order and tranquility&quot;. In 1942, over 3,000 Jews from Darmstadt were first forced into a collection camp located in the Liebigschule, and later deported to concentration camps where most eventually died. In 1944, the city was also the location of a subcamp of the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp.

Several prominent members of the German resistance movement against the Nazis were citizens of Darmstadt, including Wilhelm Leuschner and Theodor Haubach, both executed for their opposition to Hitler&#x27;s regime.

Darmstadt was first bombed on 30 July 1940, and 34 other air raids would follow before the war&#x27;s end. The old city centre was largely destroyed in a British bombing raid on 11/12 September 1944. This attack was an example of &quot;area bombing&quot; using high explosive and incendiary bombs, which combined in that attack to create a firestorm, a self-sustaining combustion process in which winds generated by the fire ensure it continues to burn until everything possible has been consumed. During this attack, an estimated 11,000 to 12,500 of the inhabitants were killed, and 66,000 to 70,000 were left homeless. Over three-quarters of Darmstadt&#x27;s inner city was destroyed. Post-war rebuilding was done in a relatively plain architectural style, although a number of the historic buildings were rebuilt to their original appearance following the city&#x27;s capture on 25 March 1945 by the American 4th Armored Division. Today around 30% of Darmstadt consists of buildings from before World War II.

=== Post–World War II ===
Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Darmstadt became home to many technology companies and research institutes, and has been promoting itself as a &quot;city of science&quot; since 1997. It is well known as a high-tech centre in the vicinity of Frankfurt Airport, with important activities in spacecraft operations (the European Space Agency&#x27;s European Space Operations Centre, European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites), chemistry, pharmacy, information technology, biotechnology, telecommunications (substantial Deutsche Telekom presence) and mechatronics. In 2000, its region also scored Rank 3 amongst 97 German regions in the &quot;WirtschaftsWoche&quot; test ranking Germany&#x27;s high-tech regions.

The roots of Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences goes back to 1876 along with Technische Universität Darmstadt (the first electrical engineering chair and inventions fame), when both these Universities were an integrated entities, a need for a separate industry based research educational institution was felt in the early 1930s, finally University of Applied sciences emerged as a separate industry based research educational institution in 1971 and is the largest University of Applied Sciences in Hesse (German: Hessen) with about 16,500 students.

The TU Darmstadt is one of the important technical institutes in Germany and is well known for its research and teaching in the Electrical, Mechanical and Civil Engineering disciplines. Together with other tertiary institutions, the TU is responsible for the large student population of the city, which stood at 33,547 in 2004.

== Parks, architecture, and attractions ==
=== Castles and historical buildings ===

Darmstadt was the capital of an independent country (the Grand Duchy of Hesse) until 1871 and the capital of the German state of Hesse until 1945. It is due to its past as a capital city that it has many architectural testimonies of this period. Many of its major architectural landmarks were created by Georg Moller who was appointed the court master builder of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Due to the fact that the last ruling Grand Duke of Hesse, Ernst Ludwig was a grandson of Queen Victoria and brother to Empress Alexandra of Russia, the architecture of Darmstadt has been influenced by British and Russian imperial architecture with many examples still existing, such as the Luisenplatz with its grand-ducal column, the old Hessian State Theatre (at Karolinenplatz) and the Russian Chapel by Leon Benois. The Russian church, St. Mary Magdalene Chapel, is named in honor of the patron saint of Tsar Nicholas&#x27; mother and was built of Russian stone on Russian soil brought to Darmstadt by train. It was used by the Russian imperial family and court during regular visits to the Tsarina&#x27;s brother and family in Darmstadt. The Residential Palace Darmstadt () is located in the city centre. It was the residence of the counts of Hesse-Darmstadt, later as Grand Dukes of Hesse by the grace of Napoleon. The rulers of Hesse also owned Jagdschloss Kranichstein, a hunting lodge in Kranichstein which is a nowadays used as a five star hotel. The most famous castle in the Darmstadt region is Frankenstein Castle due to claims that the real castle may have had an influence on Mary Shelley&#x27;s decision to choose the name Frankenstein for her monster-creating scientist. This castle dates back to the 13th century, but it was acquired by the counts of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1662.


=== Modern architecture ===
Darmstadt has a rich tradition in modern architecture. After 1945 several &quot;Meisterbauten&quot; (&quot;Masterful Architectonic Creations&quot;) were built that set standards for modern architecture. These buildings still exist and are used for various public and private purposes. In the late 1990s the Waldspirale (&#x27;Forest Spiral&#x27;) was built, a residential complex by Austrian Friedensreich Hundertwasser. As an almost surreal building, it is internationally famous for its almost absolute rejection of rectangular forms, down to every window having a different shape, the style being a trademark of Hundertwasser&#x27;s work. Hundertwasser died before the Waldspirale was finished.

=== Art Nouveau ===
Darmstadt was a centre of the Art Nouveau movement. Surviving examples of the Jugendstil period include the Rosenhöhe, a landscaped English-style rose garden from the 19th century, recently renovated and replanted, the UNESCO World Heritage Site Mathildenhöhe, with the &quot;Hochzeitsturm&quot; (&#x27;Wedding tower&#x27;, also commonly known as the &#x27;Five-Finger-Tower&#x27;) by Joseph Maria Olbrich, the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt and large exhibition halls as well as many private villas built by Jugendstil architects who had settled in Darmstadt. German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, Jugendstil. The name is taken from the artistic journal, Die Jugend, which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by Georg Hirth (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: Jugendstil (&quot;young style&quot;). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts, especially the forms of organic typography and graphic design found in and influenced by German magazines like Jugend, Pan, and Simplicissimus, it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the Netherlands, the Baltic states, and Nordic countries. The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were Munich and Darmstadt.

=== Squares ===
The &quot;Luisenplatz&quot;, the central square of the city, forms the centre of the city and is the main public transport hub. In 1844 the &quot;Ludwigsäule&quot; (called &quot;Langer Lui&quot;, meaning &quot;Long Ludwig&quot;), a 33-metre (108 ft) column commemorating Ludwig I, first Grand Duke of Hesse, was placed in the middle of the square. While the column still stands, the square is today surrounded by mostly modern buildings. Other important squares are the &quot;Marktplatz&quot; (see image) near the old city hall and the &quot;Sabaisplatz&quot; at the &quot;Mathildenhöhe&quot;.

=== Parks ===
The city has a high density of parks. Among the most important parks are the English style &quot;Herrngarten&quot; in central Darmstadt. In former times it was part of the Royal Gardens used exclusively by the dukes of Darmstadt. Today it is a public park, heavily used in every season of the year. Other important parks are the French style parks &quot;Prinz-Georgs-Garten&quot; and Orangerie, the modern style &quot;Bürgerpark&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Park&quot;) in northern Darmstadt and the mystical &quot;Park Rosenhöhe&quot; (&quot;Rose Heights&quot;), which also serves as the cemetery for the dukes and their immediate family, with two impressive mausoleum buildings (Altes Mausoleum and Neues Mausoleum) in its remote parts. The Botanischer Garten in eastern Darmstadt is a botanical garden maintained by the Technische Universität Darmstadt with a fine collection of rare plants and trees.

=== Churches ===

The Protestant Stadtkirche Darmstadt built in 1369, is in the pedestrian zone of the downtown city center, next to the historic Hotel Bockshaut. The church has gothic elements along with renaissance and baroque, it houses the royal crypt. Hotel Bockshaut was built in 1580 for a church presbytery. The most important Catholic Church is &quot;St. Ludwig&quot; in central Darmstadt. The Russian Chapel in Darmstadt is a Russian orthodox church which is still in use. It was built and used as a private chapel by the last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II, whose wife Alexandra was born in Darmstadt. Although Russian orthodox churches also exist in other cities outside Russia, the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt was the only official Russian church used by the Tsar outside the Russian Empire. It is said that the chapel was built on Russian soil that was brought to Darmstadt exclusively for the purpose of building the Tsar&#x27;s private chapel on it.

=== Festivals ===
Every year on the first weekend of July the Heinerfest festival is held in the streets surrounding the old ducal palace. It is a traditional German festival with music acts, beer halls, amusement rides and booths selling trinkets and food. The similar , which is more live music-oriented, is held in the same location every year in May. These two festivals attract 700,000 and 400,000 visitors respectively.

== Culture ==

Darmstadt has a rich cultural heritage. The Staatstheater Darmstadt dates back to the year 1711. The present building has been in use since 1972 and has three halls which can be used independently. The &quot;Grand Hall&quot; (Großes Haus) provides seats for 956 people and serves as Darmstadt&#x27;s opera house. The &quot;Small Hall&quot; (Kleines Haus) is mostly used for plays and dance and has 482 seats. A separate small hall (Kammerspiele), with 120 seats, is used for chamber plays.
Among the museums in Darmstadt the most important are the Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hessian State Museum), the Porcelain Museum (exhibition of the ducal porcelain), the Schlossmuseum (exhibition of the ducal residence and possessions), the Kunsthalle Darmstadt (exhibitions of modern art), the exhibition centre Mathildenhöhe, and the Museum Künstlerkolonie (Art Nouveau museum).

The Jazz-Institut Darmstadt is Germany&#x27;s largest publicly accessible jazz archive.

The Internationales Musikinstitut Darmstadt, harboring one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of post-war sheet music, also hosts the biennial Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik, a summer school in contemporary classical music founded by Wolfgang Steinecke. A large number of avant-garde composers have attended and given lectures there, including Olivier Messiaen, Luciano Berio, Milton Babbitt, Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono, John Cage, György Ligeti, Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Mauricio Kagel, and Helmut Lachenmann.

The Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung provides writers and scholars with a place to research the German language. The academy&#x27;s annual Georg Büchner Prize, named in memory of Georg Büchner, is considered the most prestigious literary award for writers of German language.

==Geography==
Darmstadt is located in the Upper Rhine Plain (German: Oberrheinische Tiefebene), a major rift, about 350 km (217 mi) long and on average 50 km (31 mi) wide, between the cities of Frankfurt in the north and Mannheim in the south. Darmstadt&#x27;s southeastern boroughs are located in the spurs of the Odenwald, a low mountain range in Southern Hesse between the Main and Neckar rivers.

===Climate===

===United States military presence===
U.S. forces entered the city of Darmstadt on 25 March 1945. At the end of World War II, Darmstadt was among the 112 communities where U.S. forces were stationed. Early units stationed here included elements of the U.S. Constabulary, Air Force units and a Quartermaster School.

Over the years, the U.S. military community Darmstadt – under a variety of designations such as the 440th Signal Battalion, served as home for thousands of American soldiers and their families. It included six principal installations in Darmstadt and nearby Babenhausen, Griesheim and Münster, plus several housing areas, an airfield and a large number of smaller facilities as far away as Bensheim and Aschaffenburg. The military newspaper European &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; also had its headquarters there. As of 1993, the Darmstadt military community also assumed responsibility for the remaining U.S. Army facilities in the Frankfurt area.

As part of the U.S. Army&#x27;s ongoing transformation in Germany, the Darmstadt military community, by then designated U.S. Army Garrison Darmstadt, inactivated on 30 September 2008. Even after the garrison inactivation, however, there is still one unit active in Darmstadt: The 66th Military Intelligence Group at the Dagger Complex on Eberstädter Weg. It draws its support from the nearby U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden. The U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden&#x27;s website mentions the unit still being active in Darmstadt, and a Marine Corps company being stationed there as well.

<doc id="52255" wikidata="Q58697" url="?curid=52255" title="Wild boar">
<text>The wild boar (Sus scrofa), also known as the wild swine, common wild pig, Eurasian wild pig, or simply wild pig, is a suid native to much of Eurasia and North Africa, and has been introduced to the Americas and Oceania. The species is now one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well as the most widespread suiform. It has been assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List due to its wide range, high numbers, and adaptability to a diversity of habitats. It has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range. Wild boars probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene and outcompeted other suid species as they spread throughout the Old World.

, up to 16 subspecies are recognized, which are divided into four regional groupings based on skull height and lacrimal bone length. The species lives in matriarchal societies consisting of interrelated females and their young (both male and female). Fully grown males are usually solitary outside the breeding season. The wolf is the wild boar&#x27;s main predator in most of its natural range except in the Far East and the Lesser Sunda Islands, where it is replaced by the tiger and Komodo dragon respectively. The wild boar has a long history of association with humans, having been the ancestor of most domestic pig breeds and a big-game animal for millennia. Boars have also re-hybridized in recent decades with feral pigs; these boar–pig hybrids have become a serious pest wild animal in the Americas and Australia.

== Terminology ==
As true wild boars became extinct in Great Britain before the development of Modern English, the same terms are often used for both true wild boar and pigs, especially large or semi-wild ones. The English &quot;boar&quot; stems from the Old English , which is thought to be derived from the West Germanic , of unknown origin. &quot;Boar&quot; is sometimes used specifically to refer to males, and may also be used to refer to male domesticated pigs, especially breeding males that have not been castrated.

&quot;Sow&quot;, the traditional name for a female, again comes from Old English and Germanic; it stems from Proto-Indo-European, and is related to the Latin sus and Ancient Greek &quot;hus&quot;, and more closely to the New High German . The young may be called &quot;piglets&quot; or &quot;boarlets&quot;.

The animals&#x27; specific name &quot;scrofa&quot; is Latin for &#x27;sow&#x27;.

=== Hunting ===
In hunting terminology, boars are given different designations according to their age:

== Taxonomy and evolution ==

MtDNA studies indicate that the wild boar originated from islands in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia and the Philippines, and subsequently spread onto mainland Eurasia and North Africa. The earliest fossil finds of the species come from both Europe and Asia, and date back to the Early Pleistocene. By the late Villafranchian, &quot;S. scrofa&quot; largely displaced the related &quot;S. strozzii&quot;, a large, possibly swamp-adapted suid ancestral to the modern &quot;S. verrucosus&quot; throughout the Eurasian mainland, restricting it to insular Asia. Its closest wild relative is the bearded pig of Malacca and surrounding islands.

=== Subspecies ===

, 16 subspecies are recognised, which are divided into four regional groupings:
* Western: Includes &quot;S. s. scrofa&quot;, &quot;S. s. meridionalis&quot;, &quot;S. s. algira&quot;, &quot;S. s. attila&quot;, &quot;S. s. lybicus&quot;, &quot;S. s. majori&quot; and &quot;S. s. nigripes&quot;. These subspecies are typically high-skulled (though &quot;lybicus&quot; and some &quot;scrofa&quot; are low-skulled), with thick underwool and (excepting &quot;scrofa&quot; and &quot;attila&quot;) poorly developed manes.
* Indian: Includes &quot;S. s. davidi&quot; and &quot;S. s. cristatus&quot;. These subspecies have sparse or absent underwool, with long manes and prominent bands on the snout and mouth. While &quot;S. s. cristatus&quot; is high-skulled, &quot;S. s. davidi&quot; is low-skulled.
* Eastern: Includes &quot;S. s. sibiricus&quot;, &quot;S. s. ussuricus&quot;, &quot;S. s. leucomystax&quot;, &quot;S. s. riukiuanus&quot;, &quot;S. s. taivanus&quot; and &quot;S. s. moupinensis&quot;. These subspecies are characterised by a whitish streak extending from the corners of the mouth to the lower jaw. With the exception of &quot;S. s. ussuricus&quot;, most are high-skulled. The underwool is thick, except in &quot;S. s. moupinensis&quot;, and the mane is largely absent.
* Indonesian: Represented solely by &quot;S. s. vittatus&quot;, it is characterised by its sparse body hair, lack of underwool, fairly long mane, a broad reddish band extending from the muzzle to the sides of the neck. It is the most basal of the four groups, having the smallest relative brain size, more primitive dentition and unspecialised cranial structure.

=== Domestication ===

With the exception of domestic pigs in Timor and Papua New Guinea (which appear to be of Sulawesi warty pig stock), the wild boar is the ancestor of most pig breeds. Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar as early as 13,000–12,700 BCE in the Near East in the Tigris Basin, being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 BCE in Cyprus. Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then. There was also a separate domestication in China, which took place about 8,000 years ago.

DNA evidence from sub-fossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East. This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boars, resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock. Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported in turn to the ancient Near East. Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Domestic pigs tend to have much more developed hindquarters than their wild boar ancestors, to the point where 70% of their body weight is concentrated in the posterior, which is the opposite of wild boar, where most of the muscles are concentrated on the head and shoulders.
=== Synonymous species ===
The Heude&#x27;s pig (&quot;Sus bucculentus&quot;), also known as the Indochinese warty pig or Vietnam warty pig, was an alleged pig species found in Laos and Vietnam. It was virtually unknown and was feared extinct, until the discovery of a skull from a recently killed individual in the Annamite Range, Laos, in 1995. Subsequent studies indicated that &quot;Sus bucculentus&quot; was not a valid taxon. As of 2022 the Mammal Diversity Database included it in &quot;Sus scrofa&quot;.

== Description ==
The wild boar is a bulky, massively built suid with short and relatively thin legs. The trunk is short and robust, while the hindquarters are comparatively underdeveloped. The region behind the shoulder blades rises into a hump and the neck is short and thick to the point of being nearly immobile. The animal&#x27;s head is very large, taking up to one-third of the body&#x27;s entire length. The structure of the head is well suited for digging. The head acts as a plough, while the powerful neck muscles allow the animal to upturn considerable amounts of soil: it is capable of digging into frozen ground and can upturn rocks weighing . The eyes are small and deep-set and the ears long and broad. The species has well developed canine teeth, which protrude from the mouths of adult males. The medial hooves are larger and more elongated than the lateral ones and are capable of quick movements. The animal can run at a maximum speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) and jump at a height of .

Sexual dimorphism is very pronounced in the species, with males being typically 5–10% larger and 20–30% heavier than females. Males also sport a mane running down the back, which is particularly apparent during autumn and winter. The canine teeth are also much more prominent in males and grow throughout life. The upper canines are relatively short and grow sideways early in life, though they gradually curve upwards. The lower canines are much sharper and longer, with the exposed parts measuring in length. In the breeding period, males develop a coating of subcutaneous tissue, which may be thick, extending from the shoulder blades to the rump, thus protecting vital organs during fights. Males sport a roughly chicken egg–sized sac of unclear function near the opening of the penis that collects urine and emits a sharp odour.
Adult size and weight is largely determined by environmental factors; boars living in arid areas with little productivity tend to attain smaller sizes than their counterparts inhabiting areas with abundant food and water. In most of Europe, males average in weight, in shoulder height and in body length, whereas females average in weight, in shoulder height and in body length. In Europe&#x27;s Mediterranean regions, males may reach average weights as low as and females , with shoulder heights of . In the more productive areas of Eastern Europe, males average in weight, in shoulder height and in body length, while females weigh , reach in shoulder height, and reach in body length. In Western and Central Europe, the largest males weigh and females . In Northeastern Asia, large males can reach brown bear-like sizes, weighing and measuring in shoulder height. Some adult males in Ussuriland and Manchuria have been recorded to weigh and measure in shoulder height. Adults of this size are generally immune from wolf predation. Such giants are rare in modern times, as past overhunting has prevented animals from attaining their full growth.

The winter coat consists of long, coarse bristles underlaid with short brown downy fur. The length of these bristles varies along the body, with the shortest being around the face and limbs and the longest running along the back. These back bristles form the aforementioned mane prominent in males and stand erect when the animal is agitated. Colour is highly variable; specimens around Lake Balkhash are very lightly coloured, and can even be white, while some boars from Belarus and Ussuriland can be black. Some subspecies sport a light-coloured patch running backward from the corners of the mouth. Coat colour also varies with age, with piglets having light brown or rusty-brown fur with pale bands extending from the flanks and back.

The wild boar produces a number of different sounds which are divided into three categories:
* Contact calls: Grunting noises which differ in intensity according to the situation. Adult males are usually silent, while females frequently grunt and piglets whine. When feeding, boars express their contentment through purring. Studies have shown that piglets imitate the sounds of their mother, thus different litters may have unique vocalisations.
* Alarm calls: Warning cries emitted in response to threats. When frightened, boars make loud huffing sounds or emit screeches transcribed as .
* Combat calls: High-pitched, piercing cries.

Its sense of smell is very well developed to the point that the animal is used for drug detection in Germany. Its hearing is also acute, though its eyesight is comparatively weak, lacking color vision and being unable to recognise a standing human away.
Pigs are one of four known mammalian taxa which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom. Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding. These represent four separate, independent mutations.

== Social behaviour and life cycle ==
Boars are typically social animals, living in female-dominated sounders consisting of barren sows and mothers with young led by an old matriarch. Male boars leave their sounder at the age of 8–15 months, while females either remain with their mothers or establish new territories nearby. Subadult males may live in loosely knit groups, while adult and elderly males tend to be solitary outside the breeding season.

The period in most areas lasts from November to January, though most mating only lasts a month and a half. Prior to mating, the males develop their subcutaneous armour in preparation for confronting rivals. The testicles double in size and the glands secrete a foamy yellowish liquid. Once ready to reproduce, males travel long distances in search of a sounder of sows, eating little on the way. Once a sounder has been located, the male drives off all young animals and persistently chases the sows. At this point, the male fiercely fights potential rivals. A single male can mate with 5–10 sows. By the end of the rut, males are often badly mauled and have lost 20% of their body weight, with bite-induced injuries to the penis being common. The gestation period varies according to the age of the expecting mother. For first-time breeders, it lasts 114–130 days, while it lasts 133–140 days in older sows. Farrowing occurs between March and May, with litter sizes depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The average litter consists of 4–6 piglets, with the maximum being 10–12. The piglets are whelped in a nest constructed from twigs, grasses and leaves. Should the mother die prematurely, the piglets are adopted by the other sows in the sounder.
Newborn piglets weigh around 600–1,000 grams, lacking underfur and bearing a single milk incisor and canine on each half of the jaw. There is intense competition between the piglets over the most milk-rich nipples, as the best-fed young grow faster and have stronger constitutions. The piglets do not leave the lair for their first week of life. Should the mother be absent, the piglets lie closely pressed to each other. By two weeks of age, the piglets begin accompanying their mother on her journeys. Should danger be detected, the piglets take cover or stand immobile, relying on their camouflage to keep them hidden. The neonatal coat fades after three months, with adult colouration being attained at eight months. Although the lactation period lasts 2.5–3.5 months, the piglets begin displaying adult feeding behaviours at the age of 2–3 weeks. The permanent dentition is fully formed by 1–2 years. With the exception of the canines in males, the teeth stop growing during the middle of the fourth year. The canines in old males continue to grow throughout their lives, curving strongly as they age. Sows attain sexual maturity at the age of one year, with males attaining it a year later. However, estrus usually first occurs after two years in sows, while males begin participating in the rut after 4–5 years, as they are not permitted to mate by the older males. The maximum lifespan in the wild is 10–14 years, though few specimens survive past 4–5 years. Boars in captivity have lived for 20 years.
== Behaviour and ecology ==
=== Habitat and sheltering ===
The wild boar inhabits a diverse array of habitats from boreal taigas to deserts. In mountainous regions, it can even occupy alpine zones, occurring up to in the Carpathians, in the Caucasus and up to in the mountains in Central Asia and Kazakhstan. In order to survive in a given area, wild boars require a habitat fulfilling three conditions: heavily brushed areas providing shelter from predators, water for drinking and bathing purposes and an absence of regular snowfall.

The main habitats favored by boars in Europe are deciduous and mixed forests, with the most favorable areas consisting of forest composed of oak and beech enclosing marshes and meadows. In the Białowieża Forest, the animal&#x27;s primary habitat consists of well-developed broad-leaved and mixed forests, along with marshy mixed forests, with coniferous forests and undergrowths being of secondary importance. Forests made up entirely of oak groves and beeches are used only during the fruit-bearing season. This is in contrast to the Caucasian and Transcaucasian mountain areas, where boars will occupy such fruit-bearing forests year-round. In the mountainous areas of the Russian Far East, the species inhabits nutpine groves, hilly mixed forests where Mongolian oak and Korean pine are present, swampy mixed taiga and coastal oak forests. In Transbaikalia, boars are restricted to river valleys with nut pine and shrubs. Boars are regularly encountered in pistachio groves in winter in some areas of Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, while in spring they migrate to open deserts; boar have also colonized deserts in several areas they have been introduced to.

On the islands of Komodo and Rinca, the boar mostly inhabits savanna or open monsoon forests, avoiding heavily forested areas unless pursued by humans. Wild boar are known to be competent swimmers, capable of covering long distances. In 2013, one boar was reported to have completed the swim from France to Alderney in the Channel Islands. Due to concerns about disease, it was shot and incinerated.

Wild boar rest in shelters, which contain insulating material like spruce branches and dry hay. These resting places are occupied by whole families (though males lie separately) and are often located in the vicinity of streams, in swamp forests and in tall grass or shrub thickets. Boars never defecate in their shelters and will cover themselves with soil and pine needles when irritated by insects.

=== Diet ===

The wild boar is a highly versatile omnivore, whose diversity in choice of food is comparable to that of humans. Its foods can be divided into four categories:
* Rhizomes, roots, tubers and bulbs, all of which it digs up throughout the year.
* Nuts, berries and seeds, which it digs up from under the snow when necessary and consumes when ripened.
* Leaves, bark, twigs and shoots, along with garbage.
* In warm periods, it eats earthworms, insects, mollusks, fish, rodents, insectivores, bird eggs, lizards, snakes, frogs and carrion.

A boar needs around 4,000–4,500 calories of food per day, though this required amount increases during winter and pregnancy, with the majority of its diet consisting of food items dug from the ground, like underground plant material and burrowing animals. Acorns and beechnuts are invariably its most important food items in temperate zones, as they are rich in the carbohydrates necessary for the buildup of fat reserves needed to survive lean periods. In Western Europe, underground plant material favoured by boars includes bracken, willow herb, bulbs, meadow herb roots and bulbs and the bulbs of cultivated crops. Such food is favoured in early spring and summer, but may also be eaten in autumn and winter during beechnut and acorn crop failures. Should regular wild foods become scarce, boars will eat tree bark and fungi, as well as visit cultivated potato and artichoke fields. Boar soil disturbance and foraging have been shown to facilitate invasive plants. Boars of the &quot;vittatus&quot; subspecies in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java differ from most other populations by their primarily frugivorous diet, which consists of 50 different fruit species, especially figs, thus making them important seed dispersers. The wild boar can consume numerous genera of poisonous plants without ill effect, including &quot;Aconitum&quot;, &quot;Anemone&quot;, &quot;Calla&quot;, &quot;Caltha&quot;, &quot;Ferula&quot; and &quot;Pteridium&quot;.

Boars may occasionally prey on small vertebrates like newborn deer fawns, leporids and galliform chicks, as well as small calves, lambs and other livestock. Boars inhabiting the Volga Delta and near some lakes and rivers of Kazakhstan have been recorded to feed extensively on fish like carp and Caspian roach. Boars in the former area also feed on cormorant and heron chicks, bivalved molluscs, trapped muskrats and mice. There is at least one record of a wild boar killing and eating a bonnet macaque in southern India&#x27;s Bandipur National Park, though this may have been a case of intraguild predation, brought on by interspecific competition for human handouts. There is also at least one recorded case of a group of wild boar attacking, killing, and eating an adult, healthy female axis deer (&quot;Axis axis&quot;) as a pack.

Stable isotope analysis of fossil wild boar tooth enamel from the late Middle Pleistocene found in Thailand indicate that it fed on a versatile mixed vegetation.
=== Predators ===

Piglets are vulnerable to attack from medium-sized felids like Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;), jungle cats (&quot;Felis chaus&quot;), and snow leopards (&quot;Panthera uncia&quot;), as well as other carnivorans like brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;) and yellow-throated martens (&quot;Martes flavigula&quot;).

The wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) is the main predator of wild boar throughout most of its range. A single wolf can kill around 50 to 80 boars of differing ages in one year. In Italy and Belarus&#x27; Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park, boars are the wolf&#x27;s primary prey, despite an abundance of alternative, less powerful ungulates. Wolves are particularly threatening during the winter, when deep snow impedes the boars&#x27; movements. In the Baltic regions, heavy snowfall can allow wolves to eliminate boars from an area almost completely. Wolves primarily target piglets and subadults and only rarely attack adult sows. Adult males are usually avoided entirely. Dholes (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;) may also prey on boars, to the point of keeping their numbers down in northwestern Bhutan, despite there being many more cattle in the area.

Leopards (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;) are predators of wild boar in the Caucasus (particularly Transcaucasia), the Russian Far East, India, China and Iran. In most areas, boars constitute only a small part of the leopard&#x27;s diet. However, in Iran&#x27;s Sarigol National Park, boars are the second most frequently targeted prey species after mouflon (&quot;Ovis gmelini&quot;), though adult individuals are generally avoided, as they are above the leopard&#x27;s preferred weight range of . This dependence on wild boar is largely due in part to the local leopard subspecies&#x27; large size.

Boars of all ages were once the primary prey of the tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;) in Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan, Middle Asia and the Far East up until the late 19th century. In modern times, tiger numbers are too low to have a limiting effect on boar populations. A single tiger can systematically destroy an entire sounder by preying on its members one by one, before moving on to another sounder. Tigers have been noted to chase boars for longer distances than with other prey. In two rare cases, boars were reported to gore a small tiger and a tigress to death in self-defense. A &quot;large male tiger&quot; died of wounds inflicted by an old wild boar it had killed in &quot;a battle royal&quot; between the two animals.

In the Amur region, wild boars are one of the two most important prey species for Siberian tigers, alongside the Manchurian wapiti (&quot;Cervus canadensis xanthopygus&quot;), with the two species collectively comprising roughly 80% of the felid&#x27;s prey. In Sikhote Alin, a tiger can kill 30–34 boars a year. Studies of tigers in India indicate that boars are usually secondary in preference to various cervids and bovids, though when boars are targeted, healthy adults are caught more frequently than young and sick specimens.

On the islands of Komodo, Rinca and Flores, the boar&#x27;s main predator is the Komodo dragon (&quot;Varanus komodoensis&quot;).
== Distribution and habitat ==
=== Reconstructed range ===
The species originally occurred in North Africa and much of Eurasia; from the British Isles to Korea and the Sunda Islands. The northern limit of its range extended from southern Scandinavia to southern Siberia and Japan. Within this range, it was only absent in extremely dry deserts and alpine zones. It was once found in North Africa along the Nile valley up to Khartoum and north of the Sahara. The species occurs on a few Ionian and Aegean Islands, sometimes swimming between islands. The reconstructed northern boundary of the animal&#x27;s Asian range ran from Lake Ladoga (at 60°N) through the area of Novgorod and Moscow into the southern Urals, where it reached 52°N. From there, the boundary passed Ishim and farther east the Irtysh at 56°N. In the eastern Baraba steppe (near Novosibirsk) the boundary turned steep south, encircled the Altai Mountains and went again eastward including the Tannu-Ola Mountains and Lake Baikal. From here, the boundary went slightly north of the Amur River eastward to its lower reaches at the Sea of Okhotsk. On Sakhalin, there are only fossil reports of wild boar. The southern boundaries in Europe and Asia were almost invariably identical to the seashores of these continents. It is absent in the dry regions of Mongolia from 44 to 46°N southward, in China westward of Sichuan and in India north of the Himalayas. It is absent in the higher elevations of the Pamir and the Tian Shan, though they do occur in the Tarim Basin and on the lower slopes of the Tien Shan.

=== Present range ===
In recent centuries, the range of wild boar has changed dramatically, largely due to hunting by humans and more recently because of captive wild boar escaping into the wild. Prior to the 20th century, boar populations had declined in numerous areas, with British populations probably becoming extinct during the 13th century. In the warm period after the ice age, wild boar lived in the southern parts of Sweden and Norway and north of Lake Ladoga in Karelia. It was previously thought that the species did not live in Finland during prehistory because no prehistoric wild boar bones had been found within the borders of the country. It was not until 2013, when a wild boar bone was found in Askola, that the species was found to have lived in Finland more than 8,000 years ago. It is believed, however, that man prevented its establishment by hunting. In Denmark, the last boar was shot at the beginning of the 19th century, and by 1900 they were absent in Tunisia and Sudan and large areas of Germany, Austria and Italy. In Russia, they were extirpated in wide areas by the 1930s. The last boar in Egypt reportedly died on 20 December 1912 in the Giza Zoo, with wild populations having disappeared by 1894–1902. Prince Kamal el Dine Hussein attempted to repopulate Wadi El Natrun with boars of Hungarian stock, but they were quickly exterminated by poachers.

A revival of boar populations began in the middle of the 20th century. By 1950, wild boar had once again reached their original northern boundary in many parts of their Asiatic range. By 1960, they reached Leningrad and Moscow and by 1975, they were to be found in Archangelsk and Astrakhan. In the 1970s they again occurred in Denmark and Sweden, where captive animals escaped and now survive in the wild. In England, wild boar populations re-established themselves in the 1990s, after escaping from specialist farms that had imported European stock.

=== Status in Great Britain ===

By the 11th century, wild boars were apparently already becoming rare in Britain. A 1087 forestry law enacted by William the Conqueror punished through blinding the unlawful killing of a boar. Charles I attempted to reintroduce the species into the New Forest, but this population was exterminated in the 17th century during the English Civil War. Between their medieval extinction and the 1980s, when wild boar farming began, only a handful of captive wild boar, imported from the continent, were present in Britain. Occasional escapes of wild boar from wildlife parks have occurred as early as the 1970s, but since the early 1990s significant populations have re-established themselves after escapes from farms, the number of which has increased as the demand for meat from the species has grown. A 1998 MAFF (now DEFRA) study on wild boar living wild in Britain confirmed the presence of two populations of wild boar living in Britain; one in Kent/East Sussex and another in Dorset.

Another DEFRA report, in February 2008, confirmed the existence of these two sites as &#x27;established breeding areas&#x27; and identified a third in Gloucestershire/Herefordshire; in the Forest of Dean/Ross on Wye area. A &#x27;new breeding population&#x27; was also identified in Devon. There is another significant population in Dumfries and Galloway. Populations estimates were as follows:
* The largest population, in Kent/East Sussex, was then estimated at 200 animals in the core distribution area.
* The smallest, in west Dorset, was estimated to be fewer than 50 animals.
* Since winter 2005–2006 significant escapes/releases have also resulted in animals colonizing areas around the fringes of Dartmoor, in Devon. These are considered as an additional single &#x27;new breeding population&#x27; and currently estimated to be up to 100 animals.

Population estimates for the Forest of Dean are disputed as, at the time that the DEFRA population estimate was 100, a photo of a boar sounder in the forest near Staunton with over 33 animals visible was published and at about the same time over 30 boar were seen in a field near the original escape location of Weston under Penyard many kilometres or miles away. In early 2010 the Forestry Commission embarked on a cull, with the aim of reducing the boar population from an estimated 150 animals to 100. By August it was stated that efforts were being made to reduce the population from 200 to 90, but that only 25 had been killed. The failure to meet cull targets was confirmed in February 2011.

Wild boars have crossed the River Wye into Monmouthshire, Wales. Iolo Williams, the BBC Wales wildlife expert, attempted to film Welsh boar in late 2012. Many other sightings, across the UK, have also been reported. The effects of wild boar on the U.K.&#x27;s woodlands were discussed with Ralph Harmer of the Forestry Commission on the &#x27;s &quot;Farming Today&quot; radio programme in 2011. The programme prompted activist writer George Monbiot to propose a thorough population study, followed by the introduction of permit-controlled culling.

In Scotland, wild boar are professionally referred to as &#x27;feral pigs&#x27; as the genetics of the established feral populations may come from a mix of both wild boar and domestic pigs. They are now known to be present in Dumfries and Galloway and a number of sites in the Highlands, mainly centred around the Loch Ness area. They can be killed there legally without a license and are culled by land managers as wild populations appear occasionally. , an agency that advises the Scottish government estimates that Scotland is home to a few thousand wild boars. Locals around Loch Ness that were interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; believed that the boars were becoming an increasingly worse problem, and farmers noted that they had killed and eaten several lambs.

=== Introduction to North America ===

Wild boars are an invasive species in the Americas, having been introduced by European explorers and settlers in the 16th century to serve as a source of food. Wild boars now cause problems including out-competing native species for food, destroying the nests of ground-nesting species, killing fawns and young domestic livestock, destroying agricultural crops, eating tree seeds and seedlings, destroying native vegetation and wetlands through wallowing, damaging water quality, coming into violent conflict with humans and pets and carrying pig and human diseases including brucellosis, trichinosis and pseudorabies. In some jurisdictions, it is illegal to import, breed, release, possess, sell, distribute, trade, transport, hunt, or trap Eurasian boars. Hunting and trapping is done systematically, to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boars, which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunters.

==== History ====
While domestic pigs, both captive and feral (popularly termed &quot;razorbacks&quot;), have been in North America since the earliest days of European colonization, pure wild boars were not introduced into the New World until the 19th century. The suids were released into the wild by wealthy landowners as big game animals. The initial introductions took place in fenced enclosures, though several escapes occurred, with the escapees sometimes intermixing with already established feral pig populations.

The first of these introductions occurred in New Hampshire in 1890. Thirteen wild boars from Germany were purchased by Austin Corbin from Carl Hagenbeck and released into a game preserve in Sullivan County. Several of these boars escaped, though they were quickly hunted down by locals. Two further introductions were made from the original stocking, with several escapes taking place due to breaches in the game preserve&#x27;s fencing. These escapees have ranged widely, with some specimens having been observed crossing into Vermont.

In 1902, 15–20 wild boar from Germany were released into a estate in Hamilton County, New York. Several specimens escaped six years later, dispersing into the William C. Whitney Wilderness Area, with their descendants surviving for at least 20 years.

The most extensive boar introduction in the US took place in western North Carolina in 1912, when 13 boars of undetermined European origin were released into two fenced enclosures in a game preserve in Hooper Bald, Graham County. Most of the specimens remained in the preserve for the next decade, until a large-scale hunt caused the remaining animals to break through their confines and escape. Some of the boars migrated to Tennessee, where they intermixed with both free-ranging and feral pigs in the area. In 1924, a dozen Hooper Bald wild pigs were shipped to California and released in a property between Carmel Valley and the Los Padres National Forest. These hybrid boar were later used as breeding stock on various private and public lands throughout the state, as well as in other states like Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, West Virginia and Mississippi.

Several wild boars from Leon Springs and the San Antonio, Saint Louis and San Diego Zoos were released in the Powder Horn Ranch in Calhoun County, Texas, in 1939. These specimens escaped and established themselves in surrounding ranchlands and coastal areas, with some crossing the Espiritu Santo Bay and colonizing Matagorda Island. Descendants of the Powder Horn Ranch boars were later released onto San José Island and the coast of Chalmette, Louisiana.

Wild boar of unknown origin were stocked in a ranch in the Edwards Plateau in the 1940s, only to escape during a storm and hybridize with local feral pig populations, later spreading into neighboring counties.

Starting in the mid-1980s, several boars purchased from the San Diego Zoo and Tierpark Berlin were released into the United States. A decade later, more specimens from farms in Canada and Białowieża Forest were let loose. In recent years, wild pig populations have been reported in 44 states within the US, most of which are likely wild boar–feral hog hybrids. Pure wild boar populations may still be present, but are extremely localized.

===Introduction and lack of control in South America===
In South America, the European boar is believed to have been introduced for the first time in Argentina and Uruguay around the 20th century for breeding purposes. In Brazil, the creation of wild boar and hybrids started on a large scale in the mid-1990s. With the invasion of wild boar that crossed the border and entered Rio Grande do Sul around 1989, and the escape and intentional release by several Brazilian breeders in the late 1990s – in response to a IBAMA decision against the import and breeding of wild boar in 1998 – numerous feral species formed a growing population, which progressively advances in Brazilian territory.

====Pest control in Brazil====
As a form of control for the wild boar population, hunting and killing are allowed for Collectors, Shooters and Hunters (CACs) duly registered by the environmental control agency, IBAMA, which, on the other hand, seeks to encourage the preservation of similar species of native peccaries, such as the &quot;queixada&quot; and the &quot;caititu&quot;.

====Effect on other habitats====

Wild boars negatively impact other habitats through the destruction of the environment, or homes of wildlife. When wild boars invade new areas, they adapt to the new area by trampling and rooting, as well as displacing many saplings/nutrients. This causes a decrease in growing of many plants and trees. Water is also affected negatively by wild boars. When wild boars are active in streams, or small pools of water, it causes increased turbidity (excessive silt and particle suspension). In some cases, the fecal coliform concentration increases to dangerous levels because of wild boars. Aquatic wildlife is affected, more prominently fish, and amphibians. Wild boars have caused a great decrease in over 300 animal or plant species, 250 being endangered or threatened.

The boars cause many habitats to become less diverse because of their feeding behaviors and predation. Wild boars will dig up eggs of species and eat them, as well as killing other wildlife for food. When these boars compete with other species for resources, they usually come out successful. A study published in the Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology was conducted on the results of Feral Swine control. Only two years after the control started, the amount of turtle nests jumped from 57 to 143, and the turtle nest predation percent dropped from 74 to 15. They kill and eat deers, lizards, birds, snakes, and more. These boars are called &quot;opportunist omnivores&quot;, which means they eat almost anything. This means they can survive almost anywhere. A big surplus of food and the ability to adapt to any new place causes lots of breeding. All of these factors make it difficult to get rid of wild boars.

== Diseases and parasites ==

Wild boars are known to host at least 20 different parasitic worm species, with maximum infections occurring in summer. Young animals are vulnerable to helminths like &quot;Metastrongylus&quot;, which are consumed by boars through earthworms and cause death by parasitising the lungs. Wild boar also carry parasites known to infect humans, including &quot;Gastrodiscoides&quot;, &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot;, &quot;Taenia solium&quot;, &quot;Balantidium coli&quot; and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. Wild boar in southern regions are frequently infested with ticks (&quot;Dermacentor&quot;, &quot;Rhipicephalus&quot;, and &quot;Hyalomma&quot;) and hog lice. The species also suffers from blood-sucking flies, which it escapes by bathing frequently or hiding in dense shrubs.

Swine plague spreads very quickly in wild boar, with epizootics being recorded in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Belarus, the Caucasus, the Far East, Kazakhstan and other regions. Foot-and-mouth disease can also take on epidemic proportions in boar populations. The species occasionally, but rarely contracts &quot;Pasteurellosis&quot;, hemorrhagic sepsis, tularemia, and anthrax. Wild boar may on occasion contract swine erysipelas through rodents or hog lice and ticks.
== Relationships with humans ==
=== In culture ===


The wild boar features prominently in the cultures of Indo-European people, many of which saw the animal as embodying warrior virtues. Cultures throughout Europe and Asia Minor saw the killing of a boar as proof of one&#x27;s valor and strength. Neolithic hunter gatherers depicted reliefs of ferocious wild boars on their temple pillars at Göbekli Tepe some 11,600 years ago. Virtually all heroes in Greek mythology fight or kill a boar at one point. The demigod Herakles&#x27; third labour involves the capture of the Erymanthian Boar, Theseus slays the wild sow Phaea, and a disguised Odysseus is recognised by his handmaiden Eurycleia by the scars inflicted on him by a boar during a hunt in his youth. To the mythical Hyperboreans, the boar represented spiritual authority. Several Greek myths use the boar as a symbol of darkness, death and winter. One example is the story of the youthful Adonis, who is killed by a boar and is permitted by Zeus to depart from Hades only during the spring and summer period. This theme also occurs in Irish and Egyptian mythology, where the animal is explicitly linked to the month of October, therefore autumn. This association likely arose from aspects of the boar&#x27;s actual nature. Its dark colour was linked to the night, while its solitary habits, proclivity to consume crops and nocturnal nature were associated with evil. The foundation myth of Ephesus has the city being built over the site where Prince Androklos of Athens killed a boar. Boars were frequently depicted on Greek funerary monuments alongside lions, representing gallant losers who have finally met their match, as opposed to victorious hunters as lions are. The theme of the doomed, yet valorous boar warrior also occurred in Hittite culture, where it was traditional to sacrifice a boar alongside a dog and a prisoner of war after a military defeat.

The boar as a warrior also appears in Germanic cultures, with its image having been frequently engraved on shields and swords. They also feature on Germanic boar helmets, such as the Benty Grange helmet, where it was believed to offer protection to the wearer and has been theorised to have been used in spiritual transformations into swine, similar to berserkers. The boar features heavily in religious practice in Germanic paganism where it is closely associated with Freyr and has also been suggested to have been a totemic animal to the Swedes, especially to the Yngling royal dynasty who claimed descent from the god.

According to Tacitus, the Baltic Aesti featured boars on their helmets and may have also worn boar masks. The boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the Celts, who considered them to be their most important sacred animal. Some Celtic deities linked to boars include Moccus and Veteris. It has been suggested that some early myths surrounding the Welsh hero Culhwch involved the character being the son of a boar god. Nevertheless, the importance of the boar as a culinary item among Celtic tribes may have been exaggerated in popular culture by the &quot;Asterix&quot; series, as wild boar bones are rare among Celtic archaeological sites and the few that do occur show no signs of butchery, having probably been used in sacrificial rituals.

The boar also appears in Vedic mythology and Hindu mythology. A story present in the Brahmanas has the god Indra slaying an avaricious boar, who has stolen the treasure of the asuras, then giving its carcass to the god Vishnu, who offered it as a sacrifice to the gods. In the story&#x27;s retelling in the Charaka Samhita, the boar is described as a form of Prajapati and is credited with having raised the Earth from the primeval waters. In the Ramayana and the Puranas, the same boar is portrayed as Varaha, an avatar of Vishnu.
In Japanese culture, the boar is widely seen as a fearsome and reckless animal, to the point that several words and expressions in Japanese referring to recklessness include references to boars. The boar is the last animal of the Oriental zodiac, with people born during the year of the Pig being said to embody the boar-like traits of determination and impetuosity. Among Japanese hunters, the boar&#x27;s courage and defiance is a source of admiration and it is not uncommon for hunters and mountain people to name their sons after the animal &quot;inoshishi&quot; (猪). Boars are also seen as symbols of fertility and prosperity; in some regions, it is thought that boars are drawn to fields owned by families including pregnant women, and hunters with pregnant wives are thought to have greater chances of success when boar hunting. The animal&#x27;s link to prosperity was illustrated by its inclusion on the ¥10 note during the Meiji period and it was once believed that a man could become wealthy by keeping a clump of boar hair in his wallet.

In the folklore of the Mongol Altai Uriankhai tribe, the wild boar was associated with the watery underworld, as it was thought that the spirits of the dead entered the animal&#x27;s head, to be ultimately transported to the water. Prior to the conversion to Islam, the Kyrgyz people believed that they were descended from boars and thus did not eat pork. In Buryat mythology, the forefathers of the Buryats descended from heaven and were nourished by a boar. In China, the boar is the emblem of the Miao people.

The boar (sanglier) is frequently displayed in English, Scottish and Welsh heraldry. As with the lion, the boar is often shown as armed and langued. As with the bear, Scottish and Welsh heraldry displays the boar&#x27;s head with the neck cropped, unlike the English version, which retains the neck. The white boar served as the badge of King Richard III of England, who distributed it among his northern retainers during his tenure as Duke of Gloucester.
=== As a game animal and food source ===

Humans have been hunting boar for millennia, the earliest artistic depictions of such activities dating back to the Upper Paleolithic. The animal was seen as a source of food among the Ancient Greeks, as well as a sporting challenge and source of epic narratives. The Romans inherited this tradition, with one of its first practitioners being Scipio Aemilianus. Boar hunting became particularly popular among the young nobility during the 3rd century BC as preparation for manhood and battle. A typical Roman boar hunting tactic involved surrounding a given area with large nets, then flushing the boar with dogs and immobilizing it with smaller nets. The animal would then be dispatched with a &quot;venabulum&quot;, a short spear with a crossguard at the base of the blade. More than their Greek predecessors, the Romans extensively took inspiration from boar hunting in their art and sculpture. With the ascension of Constantine the Great, boar hunting took on Christian allegorical themes, with the animal being portrayed as a &quot;black beast&quot; analogous to the dragon of Saint George.

Boar hunting continued after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, though the Germanic tribes considered the red deer to be a more noble and worthy quarry. The post-Roman nobility hunted boar as their predecessors did, but primarily as training for battle rather than sport. It was not uncommon for medieval hunters to deliberately hunt boars during the breeding season when the animals were more aggressive. During the Renaissance, when deforestation and the introduction of firearms reduced boar numbers, boar hunting became the sole prerogative of the nobility, one of many charges brought up against the rich during the German Peasants&#x27; War and the French Revolution.

During the mid-20th century, 7,000–8,000 boars were caught in the Caucasus, 6,000–7,000 in Kazakhstan and about 5,000 in Central Asia during the Soviet period, primarily through the use of dogs and beats. In Nepal, farmers and poachers eliminate boars by baiting balls of wheat flour containing explosives with kerosene oil, with the animals&#x27; chewing motions triggering the devices.

Wild boar can thrive in captivity, though piglets grow slowly and poorly without their mothers. Products derived from wild boar include meat, hide and bristles. &quot;Apicius&quot; devotes a whole chapter to the cooking of boar meat, providing 10 recipes involving roasting, boiling and what sauces to use. The Romans usually served boar meat with garum. Boar&#x27;s head was the centrepiece of most medieval Christmas celebrations among the nobility. Although growing in popularity as a captive-bred source of food, the wild boar takes longer to mature than most domestic pigs and it is usually smaller and produces less meat. Nevertheless, wild boar meat is leaner and healthier than pork, being of higher nutritional value and having a much higher concentration of essential amino acids. Most meat-dressing organizations agree that a boar carcass should yield of meat on average. Large specimens can yield of fat, with some giants yielding or more. A boar hide can measure and can yield of bristle and of underwool.

=== Crop and garbage raiding ===

Boars can be damaging to agriculture in situations where their natural habitat is sparse. Populations living on the outskirts of towns or farms can dig up potatoes and damage melons, watermelons and maize. However, they generally only encroach upon farms when natural food is scarce. In the Belovezh forest for example, 34–47% of the local boar population will enter fields in years of moderate availability of natural foods. While the role of boars in damaging crops is often exaggerated, cases are known of boar depredations causing famines, as was the case in Hachinohe, Japan in 1749, where 3,000 people died of what became known as the &quot;wild boar famine&quot;. Still, within Japanese culture, the boar&#x27;s status as vermin is expressed through its title as &quot;king of pests&quot; and the popular saying (addressed to young men in rural areas) &quot;When you get married, choose a place with no wild boar.&quot;

In Central Europe, farmers typically repel boars through distraction or fright, while in Kazakhstan it is usual to employ guard dogs in plantations. However, research shows that when compared with other mitigation tactics, hunting is the only strategy to significantly reduce crop damage by boars. Although large boar populations can play an important role in limiting forest growth, they are also useful in keeping pest populations such as June bugs under control. The growth of urban areas and the corresponding decline in natural boar habitats has led to some sounders entering human habitations in search of food. As in natural conditions, sounders in peri-urban areas are matriarchal, though males tend to be much less represented and adults of both sexes can be up to 35% heavier than their forest-dwelling counterparts. As of 2010, at least 44 cities in 15 countries have experienced problems of some kind relating to the presence of habituated wild boar.

A 2023 study found that allowing wild pigs to forage on edible garbage in large regional landfills results in those animals getting physically large/heavier, having larger litters of piglets, and causing more wild pig-vehicle collisions in the vicinity of the landfill. The effects of letting these pigs scavenge in these landfills can present unique challenges to population management, control, public safety, and disease transmission. Wild pigs foraging on edible food waste in landfills has also been identified as a vector that facilitates the spread of African swine fever virus.

=== Attacks on humans ===
Actual attacks on humans are rare, but can be serious, resulting in penetrating injuries to the lower part of the body. They generally occur during the boars&#x27; rutting season from November to January, in agricultural areas bordering forests or on paths leading through forests. The animal typically attacks by charging and pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries occurring on the thigh region. Once the initial attack is over, the boar steps back, takes position and attacks again if the victim is still moving, only ending once the victim is completely incapacitated.

Boar attacks on humans have been documented throughout history. The Romans and Ancient Greeks wrote of these attacks (Odysseus was wounded by a boar and Adonis was killed by one). A 2012 study compiling recorded attacks from 1825 to 2012 found accounts of 665 human victims of both wild boars and feral pigs, with the majority (19%) of attacks in the animal&#x27;s native range occurring in India. Most of the attacks occurred in rural areas during the winter months in non-hunting contexts and were committed by solitary males.

=== Management ===
Managing wild boar is a pressing task in both native and invasive contexts as they can be disruptive to other systems when not addressed. Wild boar find their success through adaptation of daily patterns to circumvent threats. They avoid human contact through nocturnal lifestyles, despite the fact that they are not evolutionarily predisposed, and alter their diets substantially based on what is available. These &quot;adaptive generalists&quot;, can survive in a variety of landscapes, making the prediction of their movement patterns and any potential close contact areas crucial to limiting damage. All of these qualities make them equally difficult to manage or limit.

Within Central Europe, the native habitat of the wild boar, there has been a push to re-evaluate interactions between wild boar and humans, with the priority of fostering positive engagement. Negative media and public perception of wild boar as &quot;crop raiders&quot; have made those living alongside them less willing to accept the economic damages of their behaviors, as wild boar are seen as pests. This media tone impacts management policy, with every 10 negative articles increasing wild boar policy activity by 6.7%. Contrary to this portrayal, wild boar, when managed well within their natural environments, can be a crucial part of forest ecosystems.

Defining the limits of proper management is difficult, but the exclusion of wild boar from rare environments is generally agreed upon, as when not properly managed, they can damage agricultural ventures and harm vulnerable plant life. These damages are estimated at $800 million yearly in environmental and financial costs for the United States alone. The breadth of this damage is due to prior inattention and lack of management tactics for extended lengths of time. Managing wild boar is a complex task, as it involves coordinating a combination of crop harvest techniques, fencing, toxic bait, corrals, and hunting. The most common tactic employed by private land owners in the United States is recreational hunting, however, this is generally not as effective on its own. Management strategies are most successful when they take into account reproduction, dispersion, and the differences between ideal resources for males and females.

According to a study, wild boars are causing soil disturbance that, among other problems, globally results in annual carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to that of ~1.1 million passenger vehicles (4.9 Mt, 0.01% of all GHG emissions as of 2022), implying that as of 2021 hunted boar meat – unlike other meat products – has beneficial effects on the environment even though the effect would diminish if boars are introduced for meat production and consistently retaining small populations of boars may be preferable.

<text>Farrow is a hypercorrected form of Ferror (&quot;Farrar&quot;), an occupational surname for a blacksmith or an ironworker, an old name of early Medieval English and French origin. The name derives from the Middle English and Old French terms &quot;ferrer, ferreor, ferrur, ferour&quot; (meaning &quot;smith&quot;), derivatives of &quot;fer&quot; (meaning &quot;iron&quot; in French), from the Latin &quot;ferrum&quot;. The development of the surname shows the usual Medieval English change in pronunciation (and thence spelling) from &quot;-er&quot; to &quot;-ar&quot; and &quot;-ow&quot; endings.

Due to varying levels of literacy, and regional dialects the name morphs back and forth from Farrar, Pharo, Farra, Ferrar, Farrer, and Farrow, the name itself did not change, but the spelling of it depended upon the scrivener.

The surname is found, in England, originally in those areas in which there were deposits of iron and thus an iron producing industry.

Bearers of the surname belong to various haplogroups including E-M2, I-M233, I-M253,J-M172, R-M269, R-YP5578

It is a remnant of Lake Bonneville, a prehistoric body of water that covered much of western Utah.

The area of the lake can fluctuate substantially due to its low average depth of . In the 1980s, it reached a historic high of , and the West Desert Pumping Project was established to mitigate flooding by pumping water from the lake into the nearby desert. In 2021, after years of sustained drought and increased water diversion upstream of the lake, it fell to its lowest recorded area at , falling below the previous low set in 1963. 

The lake&#x27;s three major tributaries, the Jordan, Weber, and Bear rivers together deposit around 1.1 million tons of minerals in the lake per year. Since the lake has no outlet besides evaporation, these minerals accumulate and give the lake high salinity (far saltier than seawater) and density. This density causes swimming in the lake to feel similar to floating.

The lake has been called &quot;America&#x27;s Dead Sea&quot; and provides a habitat for millions of native birds, brine shrimp, shorebirds, and waterfowl, including the largest staging population of Wilson&#x27;s phalarope in the world.

==Origin==

The Great Salt Lake is a remnant of a much larger prehistoric lake called Lake Bonneville. At its greatest extent, Lake Bonneville spanned , nearly as large as present-day Lake Michigan, and roughly ten times the area of the Great Salt Lake today. Bonneville reached at its deepest point and covered much of present-day Utah and small portions of Idaho and Nevada during the ice ages of the Pleistocene Epoch.

Lake Bonneville existed until about 16,800 years ago, when a large portion of the lake was released through the Red Rock Pass in Idaho, resulting in cataclysmic floods. With the warming climate, the remaining lake began to dry, leaving the Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake, and Rush Lake behind.

==History==
There are several maps dating back to 1575 that show the Great Salt Lake at the correct latitude and longitude, within an accuracy of a few degrees. One example is a map by Nicolas Sanson dated 1650. The Great Salt Lake entered written history through the records of Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, who learned of its existence from the Timpanogos Utes in 1776. No European name was given to it at the time, and it was not shown on the map by Bernardo Miera y Pacheco, the cartographer for the expedition. Escalante had been on the shores of Utah Lake, which he named Laguna Timpanogos. It was the larger of the two lakes that appeared on Miera&#x27;s map. Other cartographers followed his lead and charted Lake Timpanogos as the largest (or larger) lake in the region. As people became aware of the Great Salt Lake, they interpreted the maps to think that &quot;Timpanogos&quot; referred to the Great Salt Lake. On some maps, the two names were used synonymously. In time, &quot;Timpanogos&quot; was dropped from the maps, and its original association with Utah Lake was forgotten.

In 1824, it was observed, apparently independently, by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Shortly thereafter, other trappers saw it and walked around it. Most of the trappers, however, were illiterate and did not record their discoveries. As oral reports of their findings made their way to those who did make records, some errors were made. In 1843, John C. Fremont led the first scientific expedition to the lake, but with winter coming on, he did not take the time to survey the entire lake. Fremont&#x27;s glowing reports of the area were published shortly after his expedition, and they influenced the choice of Brigham Young and other members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to settle in the Salt Lake Valley in July 1847. Young visited the lake three days after arriving in the Valley, and it was supplying salt to the settlers within a month.

The lake was comprehensively surveyed for the first time in 1850 under the leadership of Howard Stansbury (Stansbury discovered and named the Stansbury mountain range and Stansbury island). Stansbury also published a formal report of his survey work which became very popular. His report of the area included a discussion of Mormon religious practices based on Stansbury&#x27;s interaction with the Mormon community in Great Salt Lake City.

Beginning in November 1895, artist and author Alfred Lambourne spent a year living on the remote Gunnison Island, where he wrote a book of musing and poetry, &quot;Our Inland Sea&quot;. From November 1895 to March 1896, he was alone. In March, a few guano sifters arrived to harvest and sell the guano of the nesting birds as fertilizer. Lambourne included musings about these guano sifters in his work. Lambourne left the island early in the winter of 1896 along with the first group of guano sifters.

===1930s Fresh Water Project===
In the early 1930s, there was a project to dam off a third of the lake with dikes on the east side north of Salt Lake City to make a freshwater reservoir for drinking and irrigation. The project was abandoned before it got beyond the planning stage.

===Causeway===
The causeway across the lake was built in the 1950s by the Morrison-Knudsen construction company for the Southern Pacific Railroad as a replacement to a previously built wooden trestle, which was the major component of the Lucin Cutoff. The route is now owned and operated by Union Pacific. About 15 trains cross the causeway each day. Before December 2, 2016, the causeway constrained the flow of water between the northern and southern arms, which had a significant impact on various industries surrounding the lake. The construction of a bridge created an opening of the causeway for water to flow between the arms of the lake.

===Willard Bay Reservoir===

Willard Bay, also known as Willard Bay Reservoir or Arthur V. Watkins Reservoir, is a freshwater reservoir completed in 1964, which separated, drained, and subsequently filled with fresh water from the Weber River a portion of the Great Salt Lake&#x27;s northeastern arm.

===West Desert Pumping Project===
Record high water levels in the 1980s caused a large amount of property damage for owners on the eastern side of the Great Salt Lake, and the water started to erode the base of Interstate 80. In response, the State of Utah built the West Desert Pumping Project on the western side of the lake. It began operation on April 10, 1987. This project consists of a pumping station () at Hogup Ridge, containing three pumps with a combined capacity of moving , an inlet canal, and an outlet canal. Also, there are of dikes and a access road between the town of Lakeside and the pumping station.

This pumping project was designed to increase the surface area of the Great Salt Lake and thus increase the rate of water evaporation. The pumps drove some of the water of the Great Salt Lake into the Newfoundland Evaporation Basin in the desert west of the lake. A weir in the dike at the southern end of the Newfoundland Mountains regulated the level of water in the basin and it sometimes returned salty water from the evaporation basin into the main body of the Great Salt Lake.

At the end of their first year of operation, the pumps had removed about of water from the Great Salt Lake. The project was shut down in June 1989, as the level of the lake had dropped by nearly since reaching its peak levels during June 1986 and March 1987. The Utah Division of Water Resources credits the project with &quot;over one-third of that decline&quot;. In total, the pumps removed of water while they operated.

Although the pumps are no longer in use, they have been kept in place in case the level of the Great Salt Lake ever rises that high again.

===Shrinking===
Drought conditions, climate change, and the overuse of snowmelt have caused the Great Salt Lake to shrink considerably. As of July 2022, the Great Salt Lake occupies approximately . In 1987, it occupied about . As of March 2023, the lake&#x27;s highest recorded surface elevation was For comparison, on April 15, 1987; the lowest recorded surface elevation was on December 17, 2022. In 2023, scientists at Brigham Young University estimated that without policy changes, the lake would dry up in 2028, with local species killed off by overly salty water somewhat before that. Continued shrinkage could also turn the lake into a bowl of toxic dust, poisoning the air around Salt Lake City. 

Environmentalists proposed establishing a level of above sea level as an official state policy, among other interventions. University of Utah researchers proposed a level between 4,198 and 4,205 feet. A non-binding resolution in the state legislature to adopt 4,198 feet was voted down and governor Spencer Cox called it &quot;dumb&quot;.

==Geography==
The Great Salt Lake lends its name to Salt Lake City, originally named &quot;Great Salt Lake City&quot; by the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Brigham Young, who led a group of Mormon pioneers to the Salt Lake Valley southeast of the lake on July 24, 1847.

The lake lies in parts of five counties: Box Elder, Davis, Tooele, Weber, and Salt Lake. Salt Lake City and its suburbs are located to the south-east and east of the lake, between the lake and the Wasatch Mountains, but land around the north and west shores is almost uninhabited. The Bonneville Salt Flats are to the west, and the Oquirrh and Stansbury Mountains rise to the south.

The Great Salt Lake is fed by three major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed directly or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River starts on the north slope of the Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some of Bear River&#x27;s waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river by means of the Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River also starts on the north slope of the Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas; rather, it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River. The Provo River does originate in the Uintas, a few miles from the Weber and Bear. The Jordan flows from the north part of Utah Lake into the south-east corner of the Great Salt Lake.

Due to the lake&#x27;s shallowness, the water level can fall and rise dramatically during dry years or high-precipitation years, thereby reflecting prolonged drought or wet periods. The change in the level of lake level is strongly modulated by the Pacific Ocean through atmospheric circulations that fluctuate at low frequency. By capturing these climate oscillations while using tree-ring reconstruction of lake level, scientists can predict the lake level fluctuation onward for 5–8 years. The Utah Climate Center provides prediction of the Great Salt Lake&#x27;s annual lake level. This forecast uses central tropical Pacific Ocean temperature, watershed precipitation, tree-ring data of 750+ years, and the lake level itself.

A railroad line – the Lucin Cutoff – runs across the lake, crossing the southern end of Promontory Peninsula. The mostly solid causeway supporting the railway divides the lake into three portions: the north-east arm, north-west arm, and southern. The causeway obstructed the normal mixing of the waters of the lake, because there were only three breaches. Because no rivers, except a few minor streams, flow directly into the north-west arm, Gunnison Bay, it is substantially saltier than the rest of the lake. This saltier environment promotes different types of algae from those growing in the southern part of the lake, leading to a marked color difference on the two sides of the causeway. On December 1, 2016, the opening of a new bridge allowed water to flow from the southern arm of the lake into the north-west arm. At the time of opening of the causeway, the north-west arm was nearly lower than the southern arm. By April 2017, the levels of both arms of the lake had risen due to spring runoff, and the north-western arm was within of the southern arm.

===Islands===
Categorically stating the number of islands is difficult, as the method used to determine what is an island is not necessarily the same in each source. Since the water level of the lake can vary greatly between years, what may be considered an island in a high water year may be considered a peninsula in another, or an island in a low water year may be covered during another year. According to the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey, &quot;there are eight named islands in the lake that have never been totally submerged during historic time. All have been connected to the mainland by exposed shoals during periods of low water.&quot; In addition to these eight islands, the lake also contains a number of rocks, reefs, or shoals that become fully or partially submerged at high water levels.

The Utah Geological Survey states &quot;the lake contains 11 recognized islands, although this number varies depending on the level of the lake. Seven islands are in the southern portion of the lake and four in the northwestern portion.&quot;

The size and whether they are counted as islands during any particular year depends mostly on the level of the lake. From largest to smallest, they are Antelope Island, Stansbury Island, Fremont Island, Carrington Island, Dolphin Island, Cub Island, and Badger Island, and various named rocks, reefs, or shoals such as Strongs Knob, Gunnison Island, Goose, Browns, Hat (Bird), Egg Island, Black Rock, and White Rock. Dolphin Island, Cub Island, and Strongs Knob are in the northwestern arm. The rest are in the southern portion of the Great Salt Lake.

Black Rock, Antelope Island, White Rock, Egg Island, Fremont Island, and the Promontory mountain range are each extensions of the Oquirrh Mountain Range, which dips beneath the lake at its southeastern shore. Stansbury, Carrington, and Hat Islands are extensions of the Stansbury mountain range, and Strongs Knob is an extension of the Lakeside Mountains which run along the lake&#x27;s western shore. The lake is deepest in the area between these island chains, measured by Howard Stansbury in 1850 at about deep, and an average depth of 13 feet (four meters). When the water levels are low, Antelope Island becomes connected to the shore as a peninsula, as do Goose Islands, Browns Island, and some of the other islands. Stansbury Island and Strongs Knob remain peninsulas unless the water level rises well-above the average.

===Lake-effect precipitation===

Due to the warm waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake-effect snowfalls are frequent phenomena in the surrounding area. Cold north, north-west, or west winds generally blow across the lake following the passage of a cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest in Tooele County to the east, and north into central Davis County, and can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally within a narrow band which is highly-dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.

The lake-effect snowfalls are more likely to occur in late fall, early winter and spring, due to the higher temperature differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City can be attributed to the lake effect.

==Hydrology==

Because of its high salt concentration, the lake water is unusually dense, and most people can float more easily than in other bodies of water, particularly in Gunnison Bay, the saltier north arm of the lake.

Water levels have been recorded since 1875, averaging about above sea level. Since the Great Salt Lake is a shallow lake with gently sloping shores around all edges except on the south side, small variations in the water level greatly affect the extent of the shoreline. The water level can rise dramatically in wet years and fall during dry years. The water level is also affected by the amount of water flow diverted for agricultural and urban uses. The Jordan and Weber rivers, in particular, are diverted for other uses. In the 1880s, Grove Karl Gilbert predicted that the lake – then in the middle of many years of recession – would virtually disappear except for a small remnant between the islands.

A 2014 study used tree rings collected in the watershed of the Great Salt Lake to create a 576-year record of lake level reconstruction. The lake level change is strongly modulated by Pacific Ocean-coupled ocean/atmospheric oscillations at low frequency and therefore reflects the decadal-scale wet/dry cycles that characterize the region. By capturing these climate oscillations as well as utilizing the tree-ring reconstruction of lake level change, researchers were able to predict the lake level fluctuation onward for as long as 5–8 years.

The Great Salt Lake differs in elevation between the south and north parts. The causeway for the Lucin Cutoff divides the lake into two parts. The water-surface elevation of the south part of the lake is usually higher than that of the north part because most of the inflow to the lake occurs from the south.

===Salinity===
Most of the salts dissolved in the lake and deposited in the desert flats around it reflect the concentration of solutes by evaporation; Lake Bonneville itself was fresh enough to support populations of fish. More salt is added yearly via rivers and streams, though the amount is much less than the relict salt from Bonneville.

The salinity of the lake&#x27;s main basin, Gilbert Bay, is highly variable and depends on the lake&#x27;s level; it ranges from 5 to 27% (50 to 270 parts per thousand). For comparison, the average salinity of the world ocean is 3.5% (35 parts per thousand) and that of the Dead Sea is 33.7%. The ionic composition is similar to seawater, much more so than the Dead Sea&#x27;s water; compared to the ocean, the Great Salt Lake&#x27;s waters are slightly enriched in potassium and depleted in calcium. Dissolved ions do not necessarily increase or decrease in step with changes of total dissolved solids. For example, in October 1903, dissolved solids tallied 27.72% and by February 1910 they were down to 17.68%, with chlorine, sodium and sulfate levels substantially lower, but over the same time calcium, magnesium and potassium &quot;increased&quot;, with the increase of magnesium especially pronounced.

==Ecosystem==

The high salinity in parts of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, nematodes, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson&#x27;s phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.

There are twenty-seven private duck clubs, seven state waterfowl management areas, and a large federal bird refuge on the Great Salt Lake&#x27;s shores. Wetland/wildlife management areas include the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge; Gillmor Sanctuary; Great Salt Lake Shore lands Preserve; Salt Creek, Public Shooting Grounds, Harold Crane, Locomotive Springs, Ogden Bay, Timpie Springs, and Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Areas.

Several islands in the lake provide critical nesting areas for various birds. Access to Hat, Gunnison, and Cub islands is strictly limited by the State of Utah in an effort to protect nesting colonies of American white pelican &quot;(Pelecanus erythrorhynchos).&quot; The islands within the Great Salt Lake also provide habitat for lizard and mammalian wildlife and a variety of plant species. Some species may have been extirpated from the islands. For example, a number of explorers who visited the area in the mid-1800s (e.g. Emmanuel Domenech, Howard Stansbury, Jules Rémy) noted an abundance of yellow-flowered &quot;onions&quot; on several of the islands, which they identified as &quot;Calochortus luteus&quot;. This species today occurs only in California; however, at that time the name &quot;C. luteus&quot; was applied to plants that later were named &quot;C. nuttallii&quot; A yellow-flowered &quot;Calochortus&quot; was first named as a variety of &quot;C. nuttallii&quot; but was later separated into a new species, &quot;C. aureus&quot;. This species occurs in Utah today, though apparently no longer on the islands of the Great Salt Lake.

Because of the Great Salt Lake&#x27;s high salinity, it has few fish, but they do occur in Bear River Bay and Farmington Bay when spring runoff brings fresh water into the lake. A few aquatic animals live in the lake&#x27;s main basin, including centimeter-long brine shrimp &quot;(Artemia franciscana).&quot; Their tiny, hard-walled eggs or cysts (diameter about 200 micrometers) are harvested in quantity during the fall and early winter. They are fed to prawns in Asia, sold as novelty &quot;Sea-Monkeys,&quot; sold either live, frozen, or dehydrated in pet stores as a fish food, and used in testing of toxins, drugs, and other chemicals. There are also two species of brine fly, as well as protozoa, rotifers, bacteria and algae.

Salinity differences between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by &quot;Dunaliella salina&quot;, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color. The dense, high-salinity water of the North Arm flows back through the causeway into the Southern portion of the lake, creating a deep brine layer there.
Although brine shrimp can be found in the arm of the lake north of the causeway, studies conducted by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources indicate that these are likely transient. Populations of brine shrimp are mostly restricted to the lake&#x27;s south arm.

In the two bays that receive most of the lake&#x27;s freshwater inflows, Bear River Bay and Farmington Bay, the diversity of organisms is much higher. Salinities in these bays can approach that of fresh water when the spring snow melt occurs, and this allows a variety of bacteria, algae and invertebrates to proliferate in the nutrient-rich water. The abundance of invertebrates such as gnat larvae (chironomids) and back swimmers (Trichocorixa) are fed upon extensively by the huge shorebird and waterfowl populations that utilize the lake. Fish in these bays are fed upon by diving terns and pelicans.

===Pink Floyd the flamingo===
A solitary Chilean flamingo, named Pink Floyd after the English rock band, wintered at the Great Salt Lake. He escaped from Salt Lake City&#x27;s Tracy Aviary in 1987 and lived in the wild, eating brine shrimp and socializing with gulls and swans. A group of Utah residents suggested petitioning the state to release more flamingos in an effort to keep Floyd company and as a possible tourist attraction. Pink Floyd was last seen in Idaho, in the area of Camas National Wildlife Refuge in 2005.

===Elevated mercury levels===

During a survey in the mid-1990s, U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service researchers discovered a high level of methylmercury in the Great Salt Lake with 25 nanograms per liter of water. For comparison, a fish consumption advisory was issued at the Florida Everglades after water there was found to contain 1 nanogram per liter. The extremely high methylmercury concentrations have been only in the lake&#x27;s anoxic deep brine layer (monimolimnion) below a depth of , but concentrations are also moderately high up in the water column where there is oxygen to support brine shrimp and brine flies.

The toxic metal shows up throughout the lake&#x27;s food chain, from brine shrimp to eared grebes and cinnamon teal.

The finding of high mercury levels prompted further studies, and a health advisory warning hunters not to eat common goldeneye or northern shoveler, two species of duck found in the lake. It has been stated that this does not pose a risk to other recreational users of the lake.

After later studies were conducted with a larger number of birds, the advisories were revised and another was added for cinnamon teal. Seven other species of duck were studied and found to have levels of mercury below EPA guidelines, thus being determined safe to eat.

A study in 2010 suggested that the main source of the mercury is from atmospheric deposition from worldwide industry, rather than local sources. As water levels rise and fall, mercury accumulation does as well. About 16% of the mercury is from rivers, and 84% is from the atmosphere as an inorganic form, which is converted into more toxic methylmercury by bacteria which thrive in the more saline water of the North arm affected by the causeway. A 2020 study found high concentrations of mercury in the lake&#x27;s sediments, a consequence from smelting and mining activities in the surrounding mountains. The mercury and other metals can contaminate the overlying water, and in turn, move into brine shrimp and other organisms.

==Commerce==
Great Salt Lake contributes an estimated $1.3 billion annually to Utah&#x27;s economy, including $1.1 billion from industry (primarily mineral extraction), $136 million from recreation, and $57 million from the harvest of brine shrimp.

===Brine shrimp===
The harvest of brine shrimp cysts during fall and early winter has developed into a significant local industry, with the lake providing 35% to 45% of the worldwide supply of brine shrimp, and cysts selling for as high as . Brine shrimp were first harvested during the 1950s and sold as commercial fish food. In the 1970s, the focus changed to their eggs, known as cysts, which were sold primarily outside the US as food for shrimp, prawns, and some fish. Today, these are mostly sold in East Asia and South America. The amount of cysts and the quality are affected by several factors, but salinity is most important. The cysts will hatch at 2 to 3% salinity, but the greatest productivity is at salinities above about 10%. If the salinity drops near 5% to 6%, the cysts will lose buoyancy and sink, making them more difficult to harvest.

The causeway across the lake was built in the 1950s as a replacement to a wooden trestle. Prior to December 2, 2016, the causeway constrained the flow of water between northern and southern arms, which has a significant impact on various industries surrounding the lake. The construction of a bridge created an opening of the causeway for water to flow between the arms of the lake.

The northern arm of the lake has a much higher salinity, to the point that the native brine shrimp cannot survive in its waters. In the southern portion of the lake, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine shrimp to survive. With the opening of the bridge, the salinity of the northern arm of the lake will likely drop as less saline water from the southern arm of the lake flows into the northern arm. The brine shrimp harvesting industry could benefit from the freer flow of water. There were concerns from the brine shrimp harvesting industry that the conditions in the southern arm of the lake were becoming too saline for the brine shrimp, following several years of lower precipitation in the lake&#x27;s watershed. The precipitation in the watershed was above normal for the water year beginning on October 1, 2016. The additional water allowed the levels of both arms of the lake to rise, creating better conditions for a healthy brine shrimp population.

===Oil and minerals===
Great Salt Lake Minerals Company (a subsidiary of Compass Minerals) extracts minerals from the northern bay. The company potentially benefited from the higher salinity of the north-west arm of the lake but had difficulty accessing water from the lake because of lower water level. Prior to the opening of the causeway, the intake channels had to be extended to reach the water.

Morton Salt, Cargill Salt, Broken Arrow Salt and the Renco Group&#x27;s U.S. Magnesium each extract minerals from the southern bay and could benefit from a more natural mixture of water between the two sides of the lake. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14% of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.

Solar evaporation ponds at the edges of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant.

The lake&#x27;s north arm contains deposits of oil, but it is of poor quality and it is not economically feasible to extract and purify it. As of 1993, approximately of crude oil had been produced from shallow wells along the shore. The oil field at Rozel Point produced an estimated of oil from 30 to 50 wells, but has been inactive since the mid-1980s. Oil seeps in the area had been known since the late 19th century, and attempts at production began in 1904. Industrial debris from this field remained in place near &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; until a cleanup effort by the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining and the Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands was completed in December 2005.

==Recreation==
The lake is one of Utah&#x27;s largest tourist attractions. Antelope Island State Park is a popular tourist destination that offers panoramic views of the lake, hiking and biking trails, wildlife viewing and access to beaches.

The State of Utah operates a marina on the south shore of the lake at Great Salt Lake State Park and another in Antelope Island State Park. With its sudden storms and expansive spread, the lake is a great test of sailing
skills. Single-mast simple sloops are the most popular boats. Sudden storms and lack of experience on the part of boaters are the two most dangerous elements in boating and sailing on the Great Salt Lake.

Dramatically fluctuating lake levels have inhibited the creation and success of tourist-related developments. There is also a problem with pollution from industrial and urban effluent, as well as a natural &quot;lake stink&quot; caused by the decay of insects and other wildlife, particularly when the shallow water is disturbed.

===Saltair===

Three resorts have operated under the name Saltair on the southern shore of the lake since 1893. Rising and lowering water levels have affected each iteration.

The first Saltair pavilion was destroyed by fire on April 22, 1925. A new pavilion was built and the resort was expanded at the same location by new investors, but after being closed for several years, it was destroyed by arson in 1970. The second Saltair included a fun house and a dancing venue.

The current Saltair serves as a concert venue. The new resort was completed in 1981, approximately a mile (1600 m) west of the original.

===Garfield Beach Resort===
The Garfield Beach Resort was established by Captain Thomas Douris in 1881 and was originally called Garfield Landing. The resort was located near Black Rock outside of the town of Corinne, and patrons traveled to it via the steamboat &quot;General Garfield&quot;. After the expansion of the resort, the &quot;General Garfield&quot; was replaced by two steamers, the &quot;Susie Riter&quot; and the &quot;Whirlwind&quot;. The iconic &quot;General Garfield&quot; was moored to the dock as a landmark. The main attraction of the resort was a massive pavilion 400 feet from shore. It covered and included of covered deck. The success of Garfield Beach eventually overtook the neighboring Black Rock resort. In 1887, the resort was purchased by the Utah and Nevada railroad. They improved the site by adding an array of bathhouses, a restaurant, and other amenities, including a bowling alley. The resort was the Salt Lake&#x27;s first to have an electric generator, which powered its many concerts, and parties held atop the pavilion tower. Garfield Beach was the most popular Salt Lake resort until Saltair was built in 1893. The resort was put out of service by a fire in 1904.

==Arts and culture==
=== Spiral Jetty ===
The northwest arm of the lake, near Rozel Point, is the location for Robert Smithson&#x27;s work of land art, &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; (1970), which is only visible when the level of Great Salt Lake drops below above sea level.

=== Oolitic sand ===
The lake and its shores contain oolitic sand, small, rounded, or spherical grains of sand that are made up of a nucleus (generally a small mineral grain) and concentric layers of calcium carbonate and look similar to very small pearls.

==Legends, mysteries and folklore==
=== Whales in the Great Salt Lake ===

The myth of Whales in the Great Salt Lake is a 19th-century Utah folklore story, originally reported in 1888, that has been debunked as a hoax. The story claimed that British scientist James Wickham introduced whales into the Great Salt Lake in 1875.

=== Lake monster ===

In mid-1877, J. H. McNeil was with many other Barnes and Co. Salt Works employees on the lake&#x27;s north shore in the evening. They claimed to have seen a large monster with a body like a crocodile and a horse&#x27;s head in the lake. They claimed this monster attacked the men, who quickly ran away and hid until morning. This creature is regarded by some to have simply been a buffalo in the lake. Thirty years prior, &quot;Brother Bainbridge&quot; claimed to have sighted a creature that looked like a dolphin in the lake near Antelope Island.

===Water babies===

The &quot;Water Babies&quot; are a part of Native American folklore associated with the Great Salt Lake. According to these stories, the cries of infants can be heard near the lake, luring people toward the water. Once someone approaches, they are said to be dragged into the depths by the &quot;Water Babies,&quot; never to return.

===Saltair Sally===
Saltair, the historic resort on the shores of the
Great Salt Lake has purported tales of paranormal activity. The most infamous of these is the story of &quot;Saltair Sally.&quot; In the fall of 2000, duck hunters discovered the partially decomposed remains of a woman near the Saltair area. Initially unidentified, she was referred to as &quot;Saltair Sally&quot; by locals. In 2012, DNA testing identified her as Nikole Bakoles, a 20-year-old mother and homicide victim. The unresolved circumstances surrounding her death have led to local legends suggesting that her spirit haunts the area, with reports of ghostly sightings and unexplained voices.

=== The Case of Jean Baptiste ===

In 1862, Jean Baptiste, a gravedigger in Salt Lake City, was discovered to have robbed nearly 300 graves. Public outrage led to his exile on Fremont Island, but he disappeared, and his fate remains a mystery. Some speculate he was seen in Montana, but no evidence confirms his whereabouts.

<text>John Howard Carpenter (born January 16, 1948) is an American filmmaker, composer, and actor. Most commonly associated with horror, action, and science fiction films of the 1970s and 1980s, he is generally recognized as a master of the horror genre. At the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, the French Directors&#x27; Guild gave him the Golden Coach Award and lauded him as &quot;a creative genius of raw, fantastic, and spectacular emotions&quot;.

Carpenter&#x27;s early films included critical and commercial successes such as &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), &quot;The Fog&quot; (1980), &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), and &quot;Starman&quot; (1984). Though he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker, his other productions from the 1970s and the 1980s only later came to be considered cult classics; these include &quot;Dark Star&quot; (1974), &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; (1976), &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), &quot;Christine&quot; (1983), &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; (1986), &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (1987), &quot;They Live&quot; (1988), &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot; (1994), and &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; (1996). He returned to the &quot;Halloween&quot; franchise as a composer and executive producer on &quot;Halloween&quot; (2018), &quot;Halloween Kills&quot; (2021), and &quot;Halloween Ends&quot; (2022).

Carpenter usually composes or co-composes the music in his films. He won a Saturn Award for Best Music for the soundtrack of &quot;Vampires&quot; (1998) and has released five studio albums: &quot;Lost Themes&quot; (2015), &quot;Lost Themes II&quot; (2016), &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;Lost Themes III: Alive After Death&quot; (2021), and &quot;Lost Themes IV: Noir&quot; (2024). Since 2012, he has co-owned the comic book company Storm King Comics alongside his wife, film producer Sandy King.

==Early life==
John Howard Carpenter was born in Carthage, New York, on January 16, 1948, the son of Milton Jean (née Carter) and music professor Howard Ralph Carpenter. In 1953, after his father accepted a job at Western Kentucky University, the family relocated to Bowling Green, Kentucky. For much of his childhood, he and his family lived in a log cabin on the university&#x27;s campus. He was interested in films from an early age, particularly the westerns of Howard Hawks and John Ford, as well as 1950s low-budget horror films such as &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (which he would remake as &quot;The Thing&quot; in 1982) and high-budget sci-fi like &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.

Carpenter began making short horror films with an 8 mm camera before he had even started high school. Just before he turned 14 in 1962, he made a few major short films: &quot;Godzilla vs. Gorgo&quot;, featuring Godzilla and Gorgo via claymation, and the sci-fi western &quot;Terror from Space&quot;, starring the one-eyed creature from &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot;. He graduated from College High School, then enrolled at Western Kentucky University for two years as an English major and History minor. With a desire to study filmmaking, which no university in Kentucky offered at the time, he moved to California upon transferring to the USC School of Cinematic Arts in 1968. He would ultimately drop out of school in his final semester in order to make his first feature film.

==Career==
===1960s: Student films and Academy Award===
In a beginning film course at USC Cinema during 1969, Carpenter wrote and directed an eight-minute short film, &quot;Captain Voyeur&quot;. The film was rediscovered in the USC archives in 2011 and proved interesting because it revealed elements that would appear in his later film, &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978).

The next year he collaborated with producer John Longenecker as co-writer, film editor, and music composer for &quot;The Resurrection of Broncho Billy&quot; (1970), which won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. The short film was enlarged to 35 mm, sixty prints were made, and the film was released theatrically by Universal Studios for two years in the United States and Canada.

===1970s: From student films to theatrical releases===
Carpenter&#x27;s first major film as director, &quot;Dark Star&quot; (1974), was a science-fiction comedy that he co-wrote with Dan O&#x27;Bannon (who later went on to write &quot;Alien&quot;, borrowing freely from much of &quot;Dark Star&quot;). The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O&#x27;Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing, and directing, while O&#x27;Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of George Lucas who hired him to work with the special effects for the film &quot;Star Wars&quot;). Carpenter received praise for his ability to make low-budget films.

Carpenter&#x27;s next film was &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; (1976), a low-budget thriller influenced by the films of Howard Hawks, particularly &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;. As with &quot;Dark Star&quot;, Carpenter was responsible for many aspects of the film&#x27;s creation. He not only wrote, directed, and scored it, but also edited the film using the pseudonym &quot;John T. Chance&quot; (the name of John Wayne&#x27;s character in &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;). Carpenter has said that he considers &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; to have been his first real film because it was the first film that he filmed on a schedule. The film was the first time Carpenter worked with Debra Hill, who would collaborate with Carpenter on some of his most well-known films.

Carpenter assembled a main cast that consisted of experienced but relatively obscure actors. The two main actors were Austin Stoker, who had appeared previously in science fiction, disaster, and blaxploitation films, and Darwin Joston, who had worked primarily for television and had once been Carpenter&#x27;s next-door neighbor.

The film received a critical reassessment in the United States, where it is now generally regarded as one of the best exploitation films of the 1970s.

Carpenter both wrote and directed the Lauren Hutton thriller &quot;Someone&#x27;s Watching Me!&quot;. This television film is the tale of a single, working woman who, soon after arriving in L.A., discovers that she is being stalked.

&quot;Eyes of Laura Mars&quot;, a 1978 thriller featuring Faye Dunaway and Tommy Lee Jones and directed by Irvin Kershner, was adapted (in collaboration with David Zelag Goodman) from a spec script titled &quot;Eyes&quot;, written by Carpenter, and would become Carpenter&#x27;s first major studio film of his career.

&quot;Halloween&quot; (1978) was a commercial success and helped develop the slasher genre. Originally an idea suggested by producer Irwin Yablans (titled &quot;The Babysitter Murders&quot;), who thought of a film about babysitters being menaced by a stalker, Carpenter took the idea and another suggestion from Yablans that it occur during Halloween and developed a story. Carpenter said of the basic concept: &quot;Halloween night. It has never been the theme in a film. My idea was to do an old haunted house film.&quot;

Film director Bob Clark suggested in an interview released in 2005 that Carpenter had asked him for his own ideas for a sequel to his 1974 film &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (written by Roy Moore) that featured an unseen and motiveless killer murdering students in a university sorority house. As also stated in the 2009 documentary &quot;Clarkworld&quot; (written and directed by Clark&#x27;s former production designer Deren Abram after Clark&#x27;s tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in &quot; Black Christmas&quot;: 
The film was written by Carpenter and Debra Hill with Carpenter stating that the music was inspired by both Dario Argento&#x27;s &quot;Suspiria&quot; (which also influenced the film&#x27;s slightly surreal color scheme) and William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.

Carpenter again worked with a relatively small budget, $300,000. The film grossed more than $65 million initially, making it one of the most successful independent films of all time.

Carpenter has described &quot;Halloween&quot; as &quot;true crass exploitation. I decided to make a film I would love to have seen as a kid, full of cheap tricks like a haunted house at a fair where you walk down the corridor and things jump out at you&quot;. The film has often been cited as an allegory on the virtue of sexual purity and the danger of casual sex, although Carpenter has explained that this was not his intent: &quot;It has been suggested that I was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I&#x27;m not. In &quot;Halloween&quot;, I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers.&quot;

In addition to the film&#x27;s critical and commercial success, Carpenter&#x27;s self-composed &quot;Halloween Theme&quot; became recognizable apart from the film.

In 1979, Carpenter began what was to be the first of several collaborations with actor Kurt Russell when he directed the television film &quot;Elvis&quot;.

===1980s: Continued commercial success===
Carpenter followed up the success of &quot;Halloween&quot; with &quot;The Fog&quot; (1980), a ghostly revenge tale (co-written by Hill) inspired by horror comics such as &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and by &quot;The Crawling Eye&quot;, a 1958 film about monsters hiding in clouds.

Completing &quot;The Fog&quot; was an unusually difficult process for Carpenter. After viewing a rough cut of the film, he was dissatisfied with the result. For the only time in his filmmaking career, he had to devise a way to salvage a nearly finished film that did not meet his standards. In order to make the film more coherent and frightening, Carpenter filmed additional footage that included a number of new scenes.

Despite production problems and mostly negative critical reception, &quot;The Fog&quot; was another commercial success for Carpenter. The film was made on a budget of $1,000,000, but it grossed over $21,000,000 in the United States alone. Carpenter has said that &quot;The Fog&quot; is not his favorite film, although he considers it a &quot;minor horror classic&quot;.

Carpenter immediately followed &quot;The Fog&quot; with the science-fiction adventure &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981). Featuring several actors that Carpenter had collaborated with (Kurt Russell, Donald Pleasence, Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Charles Cyphers, and Frank Doubleday) or would collaborate with again (Harry Dean Stanton), as well as several notable actors (Lee Van Cleef and Ernest Borgnine), it became both commercially successful (grossing more than $25 million) and critically acclaimed (with an 85% on Rotten Tomatoes).

His next film, &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), is notable for its high production values, including innovative special effects by Rob Bottin, special visual effects by matte artist Albert Whitlock, a score by Ennio Morricone and a cast including Russell and respected character actors such as Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Keith David, and Richard Masur. &quot;The Thing&quot; was distributed by Universal Pictures. Although Carpenter&#x27;s film used the same source material as the 1951 Howard Hawks film, &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, it is more faithful to the John W. Campbell Jr. novella &quot;Who Goes There?&quot;, upon which both films were based. Moreover, unlike the Hawks film, &quot;The Thing&quot; was part of what Carpenter later called his &quot;Apocalypse Trilogy&quot;, a trio of films (&quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot;) with bleak endings for the film&#x27;s characters.

Being a graphic, sinister horror film, In a 1999 interview, Carpenter said audiences rejected &quot;The Thing&quot; for its nihilistic, depressing viewpoint at a time when the United States was in the midst of a recession. When it opened, it was competing against the critically and commercially successful &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; ($619million), a family-friendly film released two weeks earlier that offered a more optimistic take on alien visitation.

The impact on Carpenter was immediatehe lost the job of directing the 1984 science fiction horror film &quot;Firestarter&quot; because of &quot;The Thing&quot;″s poor performance. His previous success had gained him a multiple-film contract at Universal, but the studio opted to buy him out of it instead. He continued making films afterward but lost confidence, and did not openly talk about &quot;The Thing&quot;″s failure until a 1985 interview with &quot;Starlog&quot;, where he said, &quot;I was called &#x27;a pornographer of violence&#x27;... I had no idea it would be received that way... &quot;The Thing&quot; was just too strong for that time. I knew it was going to be strong, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be too strong... I didn&#x27;t take the public&#x27;s taste into consideration.&quot;

While &quot;The Thing&quot; was not initially successful, it was able to find new audiences and appreciation on home video, and later on television.

In the years following its release, critics and fans have reevaluated &quot;The Thing&quot; as a milestone of the horror genre. A prescient review by Peter Nicholls in 1992, called &quot;The Thing&quot; &quot;a black, memorable film [that] may yet be seen as a classic&quot;. It has been called one of the best films directed by Carpenter. John Kenneth Muir called it &quot;Carpenter&#x27;s most accomplished and underrated directorial effort&quot;, and critic Matt Zoller Seitz said it &quot;is one of the greatest and most elegantly constructed B-movies ever made&quot;.

Trace Thurman described it as one of the best films ever, and in 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine selected it as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, at number 289, calling it &quot;a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina-wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror&quot;. It is now considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, and a classic of the genre.

Carpenter&#x27;s next film, &quot;Christine&quot;, was the 1983 adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name. The story concerns a high-school nerd named Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who buys a junked 1958 Plymouth Fury which turns out to have supernatural powers. As Cunningham restores and rebuilds the car, he becomes unnaturally obsessed with it, with deadly consequences. &quot;Christine&quot; did respectable business upon its release and was received well by critics. He said he directed it because it was the only thing offered to him at the time.

&quot;Starman&quot; (1984) was produced by Michael Douglas; the script was well received by Columbia Pictures, which chose it in preference to the script for &quot;E.T.&quot; and prompted Steven Spielberg to go to Universal Pictures. Douglas chose Carpenter to be the director because of his reputation as an action director who could also convey strong emotion. &quot;Starman&quot; was reviewed favorably by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;New York Times&quot;, and &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, and described by Carpenter as a film he envisioned as a romantic comedy similar to &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; only with a space alien. The film received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Jeff Bridges&#x27; portrayal of Starman and received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Musical Score for Jack Nitzsche.

After seeing footage of &quot;Starman&quot;, the executive producer of the Superman film series, Ilya Salkind, offered Carpenter the chance to direct the latest Alexander–Ilya Salkind fantasy epic &quot;Santa Claus: The Movie&quot;. Salkind made the offer to Carpenter during lunch at The Ritz, and while he loved the idea of differing from his normal traditions and directing a children&#x27;s fantasy film, he requested 24 hours to think about the offer. The next day he had made a list of requirements should he direct the film; they were: 100 percent creative control, the right to assume scriptwriting duties, being able to co-compose the film&#x27;s musical score, total editorial control, the casting of Brian Dennehy as Santa Claus and a $5 million signing-on fee (the same amount that the film&#x27;s star Dudley Moore was receiving). Salkind withdrew his offer for him to direct.

After the financial failure of his big-budget action–comedy &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot; (1986), Carpenter struggled to get films financed. He resumed making lower budget films such as &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (1987), a film influenced by the BBC series &quot;Quatermass&quot;. Although some of the films from this time, such as &quot;They Live&quot; (1988) did develop a cult audience, he never again realized mass-market potential.

===1990s: Commercial decline===
Carpenter&#x27;s 1990s career is characterized by a number of notable failures including &quot;Memoirs of an Invisible Man&quot; (1992) and &quot;Village of the Damned&quot; (1995). Also notable from this decade are &quot;Body Bags&quot;, a television horror anthology film that was made in collaboration with Tobe Hooper, &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot; (1995), a Lovecraftian homage which did not do well either commercially nor with critics but now has a cult following, &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; (1996), the sequel of the cult classic &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, which received mixed reviews but gained a cult following since then and &quot;Vampires&quot; (1998), which featured James Woods as the leader of a band of vampire hunters in league with the Catholic Church.

During 1998, Carpenter composed the soundtrack (titled &quot;Earth/Air&quot;) for the video game &quot;Sentinel Returns&quot;, published for PC and PlayStation.

===2000s: Semi-retirement===
In 2001, his film &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot; was released and was also unsuccessful. During 2005, there were remakes of &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; and &quot;The Fog&quot;, the latter being produced by Carpenter himself, though in an interview he defined his involvement as, &quot;I come in and say hello to everybody. Go home.&quot;

Carpenter worked as director during 2005 for an episode of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Masters of Horror&quot; television series as one of the thirteen filmmakers involved in the first season. His episode, &quot;Cigarette Burns&quot;, received generally positive reviews from critics and praise from Carpenter&#x27;s fans. He later directed another original episode for the show&#x27;s second season in 2006 titled &quot;Pro-Life&quot;.

===2010s: &quot;The Ward&quot;, focus on music and return to &quot;Halloween&quot;===
&quot;The Ward&quot;, Carpenter&#x27;s first film since &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot;, premiered at Toronto International Film Festival on September 13, 2010, before a limited release in the United States in July 2011. It received generally poor reviews from critics and grossed only $5.3 million worldwide against an estimated $10 million budget. As of 2024, it is the most recent film he directed.

Carpenter narrated the video game &quot;F.E.A.R. 3&quot;, while also consulting on its storyline. On October 10, 2010, Carpenter received the Lifetime Award from the Freak Show Horror Film Festival.

On February 3, 2015, the indie label Sacred Bones Records released his album &quot;Lost Themes&quot;. On October 19, 2015, All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties announced that Carpenter will be performing old and new compositions in London and Manchester, England. In February 2016, Carpenter announced a sequel to &quot;Lost Themes&quot; titled &quot;Lost Themes II&quot;, which was released on April 15 that year. He then released his third studio album, titled &quot;&quot;, on October 20, 2017.

Carpenter returned, as executive producer, co-composer, and creative consultant, on the eleventh entry in the &quot;Halloween&quot; film series, simply titled &quot;Halloween&quot;, released in October 2018. The film is a direct sequel to Carpenter&#x27;s original film, ignoring the continuity of all other subsequent films. It was his first direct involvement with the franchise since 1982&#x27;s &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot;. Carpenter also worked as a composer and executive producer on the 2021 sequel &quot;Halloween Kills&quot; and 2022&#x27;s follow-up &quot;Halloween Ends&quot;.

During Summer Game Fest in June 2023, it was announced that Carpenter was collaborating with Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive on the zombie first-person shooter video game &quot;John Carpenter&#x27;s Toxic Commando&quot;. The game was previously set to release in 2024 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows via the Epic Games Store.

In October 2023, he directed an episode of the Peacock streaming series &quot;Suburban Screams&quot;, while also composing the series theme music and serving as an executive producer.

On December 8, 2024, Carpenter received a Career Achievement Award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.

==Style and influences==
Carpenter&#x27;s films are characterized by minimalist lighting and photography, panoramic shots, use of steadicam, and scores he usually composes himself. With a few exceptions, he has scored all of his films (some of which he co-scored), most famously the themes from &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot;. His music is generally synthesized with accompaniment from piano and atmospherics.

Carpenter is known for his widescreen shot compositions and is an outspoken proponent of Panavision anamorphic cinematography. With some exceptions, all of his films were shot in Panavision anamorphic format with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, generally favoring wider focal lengths. &quot;The Ward&quot; was filmed in Super 35, the first time Carpenter has ever used that system. He has stated that he feels the 35 mm Panavision anamorphic format is &quot;the best movie system there is&quot; and prefers it to both digital and 3D.

==Film music and solo records==

In a 2016 interview, Carpenter stated that it was his father&#x27;s work as a music teacher which first sparked an interest in him to make music. This interest was to play a major role in his later career: he composed the music to most of his films, and the soundtrack to many of those became &quot;cult&quot; items for record collectors. A 21st-Century revival of his music is due in no small amount to the Death Waltz record company, which reissued several of his soundtracks, including &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, &quot;Halloween II&quot;, &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot;, &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot;, &quot;They Live&quot;, &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;The Fog&quot;.

Carpenter was an early adopter of synthesizers, since his film debut &quot;Dark Star&quot;, when he used an EMS VCS3 synth. His soundtracks went on to influence electronic artists who followed, but Carpenter himself admitted he had no particular interest in synthesizers other than that they provided a means to &quot;sound big with just a keyboard&quot;. For many years he worked in partnership with musician Alan Howarth, who would realize his vision by working on the more technical aspects of recording, allowing Carpenter to focus on writing the music.

The renewed interest in John Carpenter&#x27;s music thanks to the Death Waltz reissues and &quot;Lost Themes&quot; albums prompted him to, for the first time ever, tour as a musician. , Carpenter was more focused on his music career than filmmaking, although he was involved in 2018&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; reboot, and its sequels.

Carpenter narrates the documentary film &quot;The Rise of the Synths&quot;, which explores the origins and growth of the synthwave genre, and features numerous interviews with synthwave artists who cite him and other electronic pioneers such as Vangelis, Giorgio Moroder and Tangerine Dream as significant influences. The retro-1980s synthwave band Gunship are featured in the film; Carpenter narrated the opening to their track entitled &quot;Tech Noir&quot;.

Carpenter is featured on the track &quot;Destructive Field&quot; on his godson Daniel Davies&#x27; album &quot;Signals&quot;, released February 28, 2020.

His third solo album &quot;Lost Themes III: Alive After Death&quot; was launched on February 2, 2021. A new (digital) single was released on October 27, 2020, titled &quot;Weeping Ghost&quot;, followed in December 2020 by another new track from the forthcoming album, titled &quot;The Dead Walk&quot;. Two tracks that also appear on the album, &quot;Skeleton&quot; and &quot;Unclear Spirit&quot;, were released in July 2020. On the album, Carpenter collaborated again with his son Cody and his godson Daniel Davies. In August 2023, a fifth collaboration with Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies was announced for Sacred Bones Records, titled &quot;Anthology II: Movie Themes 1976–1988&quot;, and was released on October 6, 2023.

A fourth &quot;Lost Themes&quot; album was announced in March 2024, subtitled &quot;Noir&quot;. It was again recorded in collaboration with Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies. It was released on May 3 on Sacred Bones Records. The album was preceded by the single and official video &quot;My Name is Death&quot;.

==Personal life==
Carpenter met actress Adrienne Barbeau on the set of his television film &quot;Someone&#x27;s Watching Me!&quot; (1978). They married on January 1, 1979, and divorced in 1984. During their marriage, she appeared in his films &quot;The Fog&quot; and &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. They have one son, Cody Carpenter (born May 7, 1984), who became a musician and composer; Cody&#x27;s godfather is English-American musician Daniel Davies, whose own godfather is Carpenter.

Carpenter has been married to film producer Sandy King since 1990. She produced his films &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot;, &quot;Village of the Damned&quot;, &quot;Vampires&quot;, and &quot;Ghosts of Mars&quot;. She was earlier the script supervisor for &quot;Starman&quot;, &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;, &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;They Live&quot;, as well as an associate producer of the latter. She co-created (with Thomas Ian Griffith) the comic book series &quot;Asylum&quot;, with which Carpenter is involved.

In an episode of Animal Planet&#x27;s &quot;Animal Icons&quot; titled &quot;It Came from Japan&quot;, Carpenter discussed his admiration for the original &quot;Godzilla&quot; film. He also appreciates video games as art, and particularly likes the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; games &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot; and &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;, as well as the &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; series. He offered to narrate and help direct the cinematics for &quot;F.E.A.R. 3&quot;, ultimately serving as the game&#x27;s narrator and consulting on its storyline. He has also praised video games such as &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot; and &quot;Fallout 76&quot;. He has also expressed an interest in making a film based on &quot;Dead Space&quot;.

Carpenter has called his political views &quot;inconsistent&quot; and has said that he is against authority figures while also in favour of big government, admitting that this set of views &quot;doesn&#x27;t make any sense&quot;. When asked if he considered himself a libertarian-liberal, he simply responded &quot;kinda&quot;. He has been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump and has blamed modern problems in the United States on unrestrained capitalism.

Carpenter holds a commercial pilot&#x27;s license and flies rotorcraft helicopters. He has included helicopters in his films, many of which feature himself in a cameo role as a pilot.

==Legacy==

Many of Carpenter&#x27;s films have been re-released on DVD as special editions with numerous bonus features. Examples of such are: the collector&#x27;s editions of &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot;, &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot;, &quot;Big Trouble In Little China&quot;, and &quot;The Fog&quot;. Some were re-issued with a new anamorphic widescreen transfer. In the UK, several of Carpenter&#x27;s films have been released as DVD with audio commentary by Carpenter and his actors (&quot;They Live&quot;, with actor/wrestler Roddy Piper, &quot;Starman&quot; with actor Jeff Bridges, and &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; with actor Peter Jason).

Carpenter has been the subject of the documentary film &quot;John Carpenter: The Man and His Movies&quot;, and American Cinematheque&#x27;s 2002 retrospective of his films. Moreover, during 2006, the United States Library of Congress deemed &quot;Halloween&quot; to be &quot;culturally significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

During 2010, writer and actor Mark Gatiss interviewed Carpenter about his career and films for his BBC documentary series &quot;A History of Horror&quot;. Carpenter appears in all three episodes of the series. He was also interviewed by Robert Rodriguez for his &quot;The Director&#x27;s Chair&quot; series on El Rey Network.

Filmmakers that have been influenced by Carpenter include: James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, Robert Rodriguez, James Wan, Edgar Wright, Danny Boyle, Nicolas Winding Refn, Adam Wingard, Neil Marshall, Michael Dougherty, Ben Wheatley, Jeff Nichols, Bong Joon-ho, James Gunn, Mike Flanagan, David Robert Mitchell, The Duffer Brothers, Jeremy Saulnier, Trey Edward Shults, Drew Goddard, David F. Sandberg, James DeMonaco, Adam Green, Ted Geoghegan, Keith Gordon, Brian Patrick Butler, Jack Thomas Smith, and Marvin Kren. The video game &quot;Dead Space 3&quot; is said to be influenced by Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;The Fog&quot;, and &quot;Halloween&quot;, and Carpenter has stated that he would be enthusiastic to adapt that series into a feature film. Specific films influenced by Carpenter&#x27;s include Sean S. Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, which was inspired by the success of &quot;Halloween&quot;, Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;, which was heavily influenced by &quot;The Thing&quot;, Wingard&#x27;s &quot;The Guest&quot;, which was inspired by Michael Myers and influenced by &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot;&#x27;s music, Nichols&#x27; &quot;Midnight Special&quot;, which is said to have used &quot;Starman&quot; as a reference point, and Kren&#x27;s &quot;Blood Glacier&quot;, which is said to be a homage to or recreation of &quot;The Thing&quot;.

Hans Zimmer also cited Carpenter as an influence on his compositions. The 2016 film &quot;The Void&quot; is considered by many critics and fans to be heavily influenced by several of Carpenter&#x27;s films.

<text>Jennifer Beth Thompson (born February 26, 1973) is an American former competition swimmer and anesthesiologist.

She is one of the most decorated Olympians in history: twelve medals, including eight gold medals, in the 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004 Summer Olympics.

Thompson, a Massachusetts native who calls Dover, New Hampshire, her hometown, began swimming at age 7 at a summer country club called Cedardale in Groveland, Massachusetts. During the indoor season, she swam at the Danvers YMCA from ages 8 to 10, and then at the Andover-North Andover YMCA from the ages of 10 to 12. At age 12 she began swimming for Seacoast Swimming Association under coaches Amy and Mike Parratto, and moved to Dover at age 13.

She first appeared on the international scene as a 14-year-old in 1987, when she won the 50-meter freestyle and placed third in the 100-meter freestyle at the Pan American Games. She won her first world championship in 1991, as part of the USA&#x27;s winning 4×100-meter freestyle relay team, and held the world record in the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle when she participated in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Thompson attended Stanford University, and swam for the Stanford Cardinal swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Pacific-10 Conference competition. She was the recipient of the 1994–95 Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year.

In 2006, Thompson received a medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, completed a residency in anesthesiology at the Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and then a fellowship in pediatric anesthesiology at Children&#x27;s Hospital of Boston.

==World competitions and records==

===1992 Olympics===

Thought to be at the height of her competitive career at the time, Thompson was expected to win up to five gold medals at those Olympics. However, she failed to qualify for the final in the 200-meter freestyle, finished a disappointing fifth in the 50-meter, and finished second in the 100-meter, where she was beaten by Zhuang Yong of China. Thompson won two gold medals as part of the 4×100-meter freestyle and 4×100-meter medley teams. Considerable controversy was raised after the 100-meter freestyle when the U.S. team speculated on the loose doping policy standards in Barcelona—at that time the event winner did not have a mandatory doping test—only the second and fourth-place finishers were tested, based on a random draw. Thompson and her teammates believed that the Olympic champion should be tested and that rule was changed a few months later when nine members of the Chinese swimming team tested positive for steroid use.

===University years===
Thompson continued her career as a member of the U.S. national team and a member of the Stanford University swimming team, and continued to rank among the world&#x27;s best swimmers for the next four years. During Thompson&#x27;s four years at Stanford, she was a member of four NCAA championship teams, considered to be some of the most dominant collegiate teams in NCAA history. During that time, Thompson amassed nineteen individual and relay NCAA titles. She competed as a member of the USA Finswimming Team at the 8th World Championship held in Hungary during August 1996. Thompson had a poor performance at the 1996 Olympic Trials which kept her from qualifying in her individual events.

===1996 Olympics===
Thompson won Gold medals on three relay teams at the Olympics; the 4×100-meter freestyle, 4×100-meter medley, and 4×200-meter freestyle.

Between 1997 and 1999, Thompson won eight more world championship titles, including three in a row in the 100-meter freestyle.

===2000 Olympics===
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia she won a bronze in the 100-meter freestyle and was fifth in the 100-meter butterfly. But in the relay events, she swam the anchor leg in helping the USA defend its titles in the 4×100-meter freestyle and the 4×200-meter freestyle relays. She also swam the butterfly leg in the winning 4×100-meter relays. The 4×100-meter freestyle and medley teams set new world records in the process.

===2000 through 2004===

At the World Championships that year, she broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly for the fourth time, winning a qualifying heat in a time of 56.56 en route to a gold medal in the event.
Thompson seemingly retired from competition after the 2000 season with 10 Olympic medals, eight gold, one silver and one bronze, and 12 gold medals at World Championships. In 2001, Thompson moved to New York City to begin studying at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. However, while attending medical school, she made a return to competition at the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan. Thompson won five medals in two days, setting a career-best time in winning the 50-meter freestyle. At the 2003 World Championships, she would win five medals, including two gold medals.

===2004 Olympics===
At age 31, Thompson was the oldest member of the 2004 U.S. Swimming and Diving team, competing in her fourth Olympics in Athens, Greece. She was the anchor member of the 400-meter freestyle relay, where she contributed to a national record of 3:36.39 and a silver medal. She earned another silver medal as a member of the 4×100-meter medley relay. During her Olympic career, Thompson won twelve medals, eight of which were relay gold; the most for any female Olympic swimmer in history.

==Recent life and work==
In 2006, Thompson received a medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She did her internship at the New York City Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and residency anesthesiologist at the Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston. In June 2010, she was assaulted when two men attempted to steal her scooter, but she was able to fight off both of her attackers.

Thompson married Daniel Richard Cumpelik on September 5, 2010.
She currently works as an anesthesiologist for the Spectrum medical group at the Maine Medical Center in Portland, Maine.

Thompson has volunteered as a celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America, a charitable organization that raises money for cancer research, since 1995.

==Accolades and other recognition==

She was the 1993 and 1998 USA Swimming Swimmer of the Year, and ranked as the 62nd greatest female athlete of all time in a 1999 poll conducted by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. She was named by &quot;Swimming World Magazine&quot; as the Female World Swimmer of the Year in 1998, and as Female American Swimmer of the Year in 1993, 1998 and 1999. She was the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation&#x27;s Athlete of the Year in 2000.

Her adopted hometown of Dover, New Hampshire has a public swimming pool named in her honor.

<doc id="52263" wikidata="Q82238" url="?curid=52263" title="Cliff Richard">
<text>Sir Cliff Richard (born Harry Rodger Webb; 14 October 1940) is a British singer and actor. He has total sales of over 21.5 million singles in the United Kingdom and, as of 2012, was the third-top-selling artist in UK Singles Chart history, behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley. 

Richard was originally marketed as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the style of Presley and Little Richard. With his backing group, the Shadows, he dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s to early 1960s. His 1958 hit single &quot;Move It&quot; is often described as Britain&#x27;s first authentic rock and roll song. In the early 1960s, he had a successful screen career with films including &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; and his own television show at the BBC. Increased focus on his Christian faith and subsequent softening of his music led to a more middle-of-the-road image, and he sometimes ventured into contemporary Christian music.

In a career spanning over 65 years, Richard has amassed several gold and platinum discs and awards, including two Ivor Novello Awards and three Brit Awards. More than 130 of his singles, albums, and EPs have reached the UK Top 20, more than any other artist. Richard has had 67 UK top ten singles, the second highest total for an artist (behind Presley). He holds the record, with Presley, as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950s–2000s). He has achieved 14 UK No. 1 singles, and is the only singer to have had a No. 1 single in the UK in each of five consecutive decades. He also had four UK Christmas No. 1 singles, two of which were as a solo artist; &quot;Mistletoe and Wine&quot; and &quot;Saviour&#x27;s Day&quot;.

By the late-1990s, Richard had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has never achieved the same popularity in the United States despite eight US Top 40 singles, including the million-selling &quot;Devil Woman&quot; and &quot;We Don&#x27;t Talk Anymore&quot;. In Canada, he had a successful period in the early 1960s, the late 1970s and early 1980s, with some releases certified gold and platinum. He has remained a popular music, film, and television personality at home in the UK as well as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Northern Europe and Asia, and retains a following in other countries. When not touring, he divides his time between Barbados and Portugal. In 2019, he relocated to New York.

==Biography==
===1940–1958: Childhood and adolescence===
Cliff Richard was born Harry Rodger Webb on 14 October 1940 at King George&#x27;s Hospital (now King George&#x27;s Medical University), Victoria Street, in Lucknow, which was then part of British India. His parents were Rodger Oscar Webb, a manager for a catering contractor that serviced the Indian Railways, and the former Dorothy Marie Dazely. His parents also spent some years in Howrah, West Bengal. After the violence of Direct Action Day, they decided to relocate to Britain permanently. Richard is primarily of English heritage, but he had one great-grandmother who was of half Welsh and half Spanish descent, born of a Spanish great-great-grandmother named Emiline Joseph Rebeiro.

The Webb family lived in a modest home in Maqbara, near the main shopping centre of Hazratganj. Dorothy&#x27;s mother served as the dormitory matron at the La Martiniere Girls&#x27; School. Richard had three sisters, Joan and Jacqui, plus Donna (1942–2016).

In 1948, following Indian independence, the family embarked on a three-week sea voyage to Tilbury, Essex, England, aboard the . The Webbs moved from comparative wealth in India, where they lived in a company-supplied flat at Howrah near Calcutta, to a semi-detached house in Carshalton, north Surrey. Harry Webb attended a local primary school, Stanley Park Juniors, in Carshalton. 

In 1949, his father obtained employment in the credit control office of Thorn Electrical Industries, Enfield, and the family moved in with other relatives in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, where he attended Kings Road Junior Mixed Infants School, until a three-bedroom council house in nearby Cheshunt was allocated to them in 1950, at 12 Hargreaves Close.

He then attended Cheshunt Secondary Modern School from 1952 to 1957. As a member of the top stream, he stayed on beyond the minimum leaving age to take GCE Ordinary Level examinations and gained a pass in English literature. He then started work as a filing clerk for Atlas Lamps. A development of retirement flats, Cliff Richard Court, has been named after him in Cheshunt.

Harry Webb became interested in skiffle. When he was 16, his father bought him a guitar, and in 1957, he formed the school vocal harmony group The Quintones, before singing in the Dick Teague Skiffle Group.

===1958–1963: Success and stardom===

Harry Webb became lead singer of a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name). The 1950s entrepreneur Harry Greatorex wanted the up-and-coming rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer to change his name. The name &quot;Cliff&quot; was adopted as it sounded like &quot;cliff face&quot;, which suggested &quot;Rock&quot;. It was &quot;Move It&quot; writer Ian Samwell who suggested the surname &quot;Richard&quot; as a tribute to Webb&#x27;s musical hero Little Richard.

Before their first large-scale appearance, at the Regal Ballroom in Ripley, Derbyshire in 1958, they adopted the name &quot;Cliff Richard and the Drifters&quot;. The four members were Harry Webb (by then going under the stage name &quot;Cliff Richard&quot;), Ian Samwell on guitar, Terry Smart on drums and Norman Mitham on guitar. None of the other three played with the later and better known Shadows, although Samwell wrote songs for Richard&#x27;s later career. Agent George Ganjou saw the group perform in London, and recommended them to Norrie Paramor for an audition.

For Richard&#x27;s debut session, Paramor provided him with &quot;Schoolboy Crush&quot;, a song previously recorded by American Bobby Helms. Richard was permitted to record one of his own songs for the B-side; this was &quot;Move It&quot;, written and composed by the Drifters&#x27; Samwell while he was on board a number 715 Green Line bus on the way to Richard&#x27;s house for a rehearsal. For the &quot;Move It&quot; session, Paramor used the session guitarist Ernie Shears on lead guitar and Frank Clark on bass.

There are various stories about why the A-side was replaced by the intended B-side. One is that Norrie Paramor&#x27;s young daughter raved about the B-side; another was that influential TV producer Jack Good, who used the act for his TV show &quot;Oh Boy!&quot;, wanted the only song on his show to be &quot;Move It&quot; as opposed to &quot;Schoolboy Crush&quot;. Richard was quoted as saying:
The single went to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. John Lennon credited &quot;Move It&quot; as being the first British rock record.
In the early days, Richard was marketed as the British equivalent of Elvis. Like previous British rockers such as Tommy Steele and Marty Wilde, Richard adopted Elvis-like dress and hairstyle. In performance he struck a pose of rock attitude, rarely smiling or looking at the audience or camera. His late 1958 and early 1959 follow-up singles, &quot;High Class Baby&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; Lovin&#x27; Doll&quot;, were followed by &quot;Mean Streak&quot;, which carried a rocker&#x27;s sense of speed and passion, and Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Living Doll&quot;.

It was on &quot;Living Doll&quot; that the Drifters began to back Richard on record. It was his fifth record and became his first No. 1 single. By that time, the group&#x27;s line-up had changed with the arrival of Jet Harris, Tony Meehan, Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch. The group was obliged to change its name to &quot;The Shadows&quot; after legal complications with the American group the Drifters as &quot;Living Doll&quot; entered the American top 40, licensed by ABC-Paramount. &quot;Living Doll&quot; was used in Richard&#x27;s début film &quot;Serious Charge&quot;, but it was arranged as a country standard, rather than a rock and roll standard.

The Shadows were not a typical backing group. They became contractually separate from Richard, and the group received no royalties for records backing Richard. In 1959, the Shadows (then still the Drifters) landed an EMI recording contract of their own, for independent recordings. That year, they released three singles, two of which featured double-sided vocals and one of which had instrumental A and B sides. They thereafter had several major hits, including five UK No. 1s. The band also continued to appear and record with Richard and wrote many of his hits. On more than one occasion, a Shadows instrumental replaced a Richard song at the top of the British charts.

Richard&#x27;s fifth single &quot;Living Doll&quot; triggered a softer, more relaxed, sound. Subsequent hits, the No. 1s &quot;Travellin&#x27; Light&quot; and &quot;I Love You&quot; and also &quot;A Voice in the Wilderness&quot;, lifted from his film &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot;, and &quot;Theme for a Dream&quot; cemented Richard&#x27;s status as a mainstream pop entertainer along with contemporaries such as Adam Faith and Billy Fury. Throughout the early 1960s, his hits were consistently in the top five.
In 1961, EMI records organised Richard&#x27;s 21st birthday party at its London headquarters in Manchester Square led by his producer Norrie Paramor. Photographs of the celebrations were incorporated into Richard&#x27;s next album, &quot;21 Today&quot;, in which Tony Meehan joined in despite having very recently left the Shadows to be replaced by Brian Bennett.

Typically, the Shadows closed the first half of the show with a 30-minute set of their own, then backed Richard on his show-closing 45-minute stint, as exemplified by the retrospective CD album release of &quot;Live at the ABC Kingston 1962&quot;. Tony Meehan and Jet Harris left the group in 1961 and 1962 respectively, and later had their own chart successes for Decca. The Shadows added bass players Brian Locking (1962–63) and then John Rostill (1963–68) and took on Brian Bennett permanently on drums.

In the early years, particularly on album and EP releases, Richard also recorded ballads backed by the Norrie Paramor Orchestra with Tony Meehan (and later Brian Bennett) as a session drummer. His first such single without the Shadows was &quot;When the Girl in Your Arms Is the Girl in Your Heart&quot; in 1961, and he continued to release one or two per year, including covers of &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Game&quot; in 1963 and &quot;Constantly&quot; in 1964, a revival of the popular Italian hit &quot;L&#x27;edera&quot;. In 1965, sessions under the direction of Billy Sherrill in Nashville, Tennessee were particularly successful, yielding &quot;The Minute You&#x27;re Gone&quot;, which topped the UK singles chart, and &quot;Wind Me Up (Let Me Go)&quot;, which made No. 2.
Richard, and the Shadows in particular, however, never achieved star status in the United States. In 1960 they toured the United States and were well-received, but lacklustre support and distribution from a revolving door of American record labels proved an obstacle to long-term success there, despite several chart records by Richard, including the aforementioned &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Game&quot; on Epic, via a renewed linking of the worldwide Columbia labels after Philips ended its distribution deal with CBS. To the Shadows&#x27; chagrin, &quot;Apache&quot; reached No. 2 in the US through a cover version by Danish guitarist Jorgen Ingmann which was almost unchanged from their worldwide hit. Richard and the band appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which was crucial for the Beatles, but these performances did not help them gain sustained success in North America.

Richard and the Shadows appeared in six feature films, including a debut in the 1959 film &quot;Serious Charge&quot; but most notably in &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, &quot;Summer Holiday&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;, and &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;. These films created their own genre, known as the &quot;Cliff Richard musical&quot;, and led to Richard&#x27;s being named the No. 1 cinema box office attraction in Britain for both 1962 and 1963, beating that of even James Bond. The title song of &quot;The Young Ones&quot; became his biggest-selling single in the United Kingdom, selling over one million copies in the UK. The irreverent 1980s TV sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot; took its name from Richard&#x27;s 1962 film. In mid-1963, Cliff and the Shadows appeared for a season in Blackpool, where Richard had his portrait modelled by Victor Heyfron.

===1964–1975: Changing circumstances===
As with the other contemporary rock acts in Britain, Richard&#x27;s career was affected by the advent of the Beatles and the Mersey sound in 1963 and 1964. He continued to be popular, and have hits in the charts throughout the 1960s, though not at the level that he had enjoyed before. Nor did doors open to him in the US market; he was not considered part of the British Invasion, and despite four Hot 100 hits (including the top 25 &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Game&quot;) between August 1963 and August 1964, the American public had little awareness of him.

Although baptised as an Anglican, Richard did not practise the faith in his early years. In 1964, he became an active evangelical Christian and his faith has become an important aspect of his life. Standing up publicly as an evangelical affected his career in several ways. Initially, he believed that he should quit rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, feeling he could no longer be the rocker who had been called a &quot;crude exhibitionist&quot; and &quot;too sexy for TV&quot;. Richard intended at first to &quot;reform his ways&quot; and become a teacher, but evangelical Christian friends advised him not to abandon his career. Soon after, Richard re-emerged, performing with Christian groups and recording some overtly Christian material. He still recorded secular songs with the Shadows, but devoted a lot of his time to Christian based work, including appearances with the Billy Graham crusades. As time progressed, Richard balanced his faith and work, enabling him to remain one of the most popular singers in Britain, as well as one of its best-known evangelical Christians.

Richard&#x27;s 1965 UK No. 12 hit &quot;On My Word&quot; ended a run of 23 consecutive top ten UK hits between &quot;A Voice in the Wilderness&quot; in 1960 to &quot;The Minute You&#x27;re Gone&quot; in 1965, which, to date, is still a record number of consecutive top ten UK hits for a male artist. Richard continued having international hits, including 1967&#x27;s &quot;The Day I Met Marie&quot;, which reached No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 5 in the Australian charts.

Richard acted in the 1967 film &quot;Two a Penny&quot;, released by Billy Graham&#x27;s World Wide Pictures, in which he played Jamie Hopkins, a young man who gets involved in drug dealing while questioning his life after his girlfriend changes her attitude. He released the live album &quot;Cliff in Japan&quot; in 1967.

In 1968, Richard sang the UK&#x27;s entry in the Eurovision Song Contest, &quot;Congratulations&quot;, written and composed by Bill Martin and Phil Coulter; it finished second, however, by one point to Spain&#x27;s &quot;La La La&quot; by Massiel. According to John Kennedy O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;The Eurovision Song Contest—The Official History&quot;, this was the closest result yet in the contest, and Richard locked himself in the toilet to avoid the nerves of the voting. Nevertheless, &quot;Congratulations&quot; was a huge hit throughout Europe and Australia, and yet another UK No. 1 in April 1968.
After the Shadows split in 1968, Richard continued to record. During the 1970s, Richard took part in several television shows and fronted his own show &quot;It&#x27;s Cliff Richard&quot; from 1970 to 1976. It starred Olivia Newton-John, Hank Marvin and Una Stubbs, and included &quot;A Song for Europe&quot;. He began 1970 by appearing live on the BBC&#x27;s review of the sixties music scene, &quot;Pop Go The Sixties&quot;, which was broadcast across Britain and Europe on 31 December 1969. He performed &quot;Bachelor Boy&quot; with the Shadows and &quot;Congratulations&quot; solo. In 1972, he made a short BBC television comedy film called &quot;The Case&quot; with appearances from comedians and his first ever duets with a woman—Newton-John. He went on to release a double live album, &quot;Cliff Live in Japan 1972&quot;, which featured Newton-John.

His final acting role on the silver screen to date was in 1973, when he starred in the film &quot;Take Me High&quot;.

In 1973, he sang the British Eurovision entry &quot;Power to All Our Friends;&quot; the song finished third, close behind Luxembourg&#x27;s &quot; by Anne-Marie David and Spain&#x27;s &quot; by Mocedades. This time, Richard took Valium to overcome his nerves, and his manager was almost unable to wake him for the performance. Richard also hosted the BBC&#x27;s qualifying heat for the Eurovision Song Contest, &quot;A Song for Europe,&quot; in , , and as part of his BBCTV variety series. He also presented the Eurovision Song Contest Previews for the BBC in 1971 and 1972.

In 1975, he released the single &quot;Honky Tonk Angel&quot;, produced by Hank Marvin and John Farrar, oblivious to its connotations or hidden meanings. As soon as he was notified that a &quot;honky-tonk angel&quot; was southern US slang for a prostitute, the horrified Richard ordered EMI to withdraw it and refused to promote it, despite making a video for it. EMI agreed to his demand despite the fact the single was expected to sell well. About 1,000 copies are known to exist on vinyl.

===1976–1994: Renaissance===
In 1976, the decision was made to repackage Richard as a rock artist. That year, Bruce Welch relaunched Cliff&#x27;s career and produced the landmark album &quot;I&#x27;m Nearly Famous&quot;, which included the successful but controversial guitar-driven track &quot;Devil Woman&quot;, which became Richard&#x27;s first true hit in the United States, and the ballad &quot;Miss You Nights&quot;. In reviewing the new album in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Geoff Brown heralded it the renaissance of Richard. Richard&#x27;s fans were excited about this revival of a performer who had been a part of British rock from its early days. Many big names in music such as Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and Elton John were seen sporting &quot;I&#x27;m Nearly Famous&quot; badges, pleased that their boyhood idol was getting back into the heavier rock in which he had begun his career.

Notwithstanding this, Richard continued to release albums with contemporary Christian music content in parallel with his rock and pop albums, for example: &quot;Small Corners&quot; from 1978 contained the single &quot;Yes He Lives&quot;. On 31 December 1976, he performed his latest single, &quot;Hey, Mr. Dream Maker&quot;, on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;A Jubilee of Music&quot;, celebrating British pop music for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s impending Silver Jubilee.

In 1979, Richard teamed up once again with producer Bruce Welch for the pop hit single &quot;We Don&#x27;t Talk Anymore&quot;, written and composed by Alan Tarney, which hit No. 1 in the UK and No. 7 in the US. Bryan Ferry added hummed backing vocals to the song. The record made Richard the first act to reach the Hot 100&#x27;s top 40 in the 1980s who had also been there in each of the three previous decades. The song was quickly added onto the end of his latest album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Juvenile,&quot; which was re-titled &quot;We Don&#x27;t Talk Anymore&quot; for its release in the United States. It was his first time at the top of the UK singles chart in over ten years, and the song would become his biggest-selling single worldwide, selling almost five million copies throughout the world. Later in 1979, Richard performed with Kate Bush at the London Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s 75th anniversary celebration at the Royal Albert Hall.

With &quot;We Don&#x27;t Talk Anymore&quot; in 1979, Richard finally began to receive some extended success in the United States to follow on from the success of &quot;Devil Woman&quot; in 1976. In 1980, &quot;Carrie&quot; broke into the US top 40, followed by &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, which reached No. 10. His 1980 duet &quot;Suddenly&quot; with Olivia Newton-John, from the film &quot;Xanadu&quot;, peaked at No. 20, followed by &quot;A Little in Love&quot; (No. 17) and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; (No. 23) in 1981. After many years of limited success in the US, three of his singles simultaneously charted on the last Hot 100 of 1980 (&quot;A Little in Love&quot;, &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Suddenly&quot;).

In the UK, meanwhile, &quot;Carrie&quot; reached No. 4 and &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot; peaked at No. 8. In a retrospective review of &quot;Carrie&quot;, AllMusic journalist Dave Thompson praised &quot;Carrie&quot; as being &quot;an enthrallingly atmospheric number. One of the most electrifying of all Cliff Richard&#x27;s recordings.&quot;

In 1980, Richard officially changed his name, by deed poll, from Harry Rodger Webb to Cliff Richard. At the same time, he received, from the Queen, the award of Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to music and charity.

In 1981, the single &quot;Wired for Sound&quot; hit No. 4 in the UK and also became Richard&#x27;s biggest hit in Australia since the early 1960s. To finish the year, &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; hit No. 2 in the UK. On the singles chart, Richard was having his most consistent period of top twenty hits since the mid-1960s. He also was amassing a string of top ten albums, including &quot;I&#x27;m No Hero&quot;, &quot;Wired for Sound&quot;, &quot;Now You See Me, Now You Don&#x27;t&quot;, a live album he recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra titled &quot;Dressed for the Occasion&quot;, and &quot;Silver&quot;, marking his 25th year in show business in 1983.

In 1986, Richard reached No. 1 by teaming up with the cast of the comedy series &quot;The Young Ones&quot; to re-record his smash hit &quot;Living Doll&quot; for the charity Comic Relief. Along with the song, the recording contained comedy dialogue between Richard and the Young Ones. That same year, Richard opened in the West End as a rock musician called upon to defend Earth in a trial set in the Andromeda Galaxy in the multi-media Dave Clark musical &quot;Time&quot;. Three Richard singles, &quot;She&#x27;s So Beautiful&quot;, which reached No. 17 in the UK, &quot;It&#x27;s in Every One of Us&quot; and &quot;Born To Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot;, were released over 1985 and 1986 from the concept album recorded for &quot;Time&quot;.

In August 1986, Richard was involved in a five-car crash in torrential rain on the M4 motorway in West London. Richard&#x27;s car was a write-off,as another car swerved and braked hard. Richard hurt his back in the accident, but was not seriously injured. Police called for a cab from the accident scene so that he was able to perform that night in the &quot;Time&quot; musical. After the show, Richard said: &quot;I&#x27;m lucky to be here&quot;. He said that his seatbelt had prevented him from flying through the windscreen.

In October 1986, &quot;All I Ask of You&quot;, a duet that Richard recorded with Sarah Brightman from the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical version of The Phantom of the Opera reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart. 1987 saw the release of his &quot;Always Guaranteed&quot; album, which became his best-selling album of all-new material, and included the two top-10 hit singles &quot;My Pretty One&quot; and &quot;Some People&quot;.

Richard concluded his thirtieth year in music by achieving a UK Christmas No. 1 single in 1988 with &quot;Mistletoe and Wine&quot;, while simultaneously holding the No. 1 positions on the album and video charts with the compilation &quot;Private Collection&quot;, which collected his biggest hits from 1979 to 1988. &quot;Mistletoe and Wine&quot; was Richard&#x27;s 99th UK single and spent four weeks at the top of the chart. It was the best-selling UK single of 1988, shifting 750,000 copies. The album was certified quadruple platinum, becoming Richard&#x27;s first to be certified multi-platinum by the BPI since it had introduced multi-platinum awards in February 1987.

In May 1989, Richard released his 100th single, &quot;The Best of Me&quot;, becoming the first British artist to achieve the feat. The single peaked at No. 2 in the UK. It was also the lead single from the UK top ten album &quot;Stronger&quot;. Released along with the singles &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Have the Heart&quot; (UK No. 3), &quot;Lean On You&quot; (No. 17) and &quot;Stronger Than That&quot; (No. 14), the album become Richard&#x27;s first studio album to amass four UK top twenty hits.

Richard received the Brits highest honour, The Outstanding Contribution award&quot;, in 1989. In June that year, he filled London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium for two nights with a spectacular titled The Event in front of a combined audience of 144,000 people.

On 30 June 1990, Richard performed to an estimated 120,000 people at England&#x27;s Knebworth Park as part of an all-star concert line-up that also included Paul McCartney, Phil Collins, Elton John and Tears for Fears. The concert in aid of charity was televised around the world and helped to raise $10.5 million for disabled children and young musicians.

Later in 1990, a live album titled &quot;From a Distance: The Event&quot; was released. It compiled highlights of the previous year&#x27;s The Event show, and provided two live tracks as singles, &quot;Silhouettes&quot; (UK No. 10) and &quot;From a Distance&quot; (No. 11). However, it was with the Christmas single &quot;Saviour&#x27;s Day&quot; that Richard scored his 13th UK No. 1 single and his 100th top 40 hit. The album itself reached No. 3 over the Christmas period and was certified double platinum by the BPI.

Following the success of the recent Christmas singles, Richard released his first Christmas album, &quot;Together with Cliff Richard&quot;, in 1991, but his bid for the UK Christmas No. 1 spot again with &quot;We Should Be Together&quot; was unsuccessful (making No. 10). 1992 saw &quot;I Still Believe in You&quot; (No. 7) released as his Christmas single, while 1993 saw Richard&#x27;s first new music studio album for over three years released. Simply titled &quot;The Album&quot;, it debuted at No.1 on the UK album chart. &quot;Peace in Our Time&quot; (No. 8) was the second lead single, followed by &quot;Human Work of Art&quot; (No. 24) and &quot;Healing Love&quot; (No. 19) for Christmas. In 1994, the compilation &quot;The Hit List&quot; was released; meanwhile in the background, Richard was concentrating on bringing the musical &quot;Heathcliff&quot; to the stage.

With Richard&#x27;s succession of hit songs and albums from the late 1970s into the early 1980s, followed by another strong run in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a strong fan base had been reestablished and Richard remained one of the best-known music artists in the country. Over the course of the 1980s, he recorded with Olivia Newton-John, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Phil Everly, Janet Jackson, Sheila Walsh and Van Morrison. Meanwhile, the Shadows later re-formed (and again split). They recorded on their own, but also reunited with Richard in 1978, 1984 and 1989–90.

===1995–2007: Knighthood===
On 17 June 1995, Richard was appointed a Knight Bachelor (invested on 25 October 1995), becoming the first rock star to be so honoured. In 1996, he led the Wimbledon Centre Court crowd in singing during a rain delay when asked by Wimbledon officials to entertain the crowd. In the late 1990s, Richard and former EMI UK managing director Clive Black established the record label Blacknight. In 1998, Richard demonstrated that radio stations were refusing to play his music when he released a dance remix of his forthcoming single &quot;Can&#x27;t Keep This Feeling In&quot; on a white label record using the alias Blacknight. The single was featured on playlists until the artist&#x27;s identity was revealed. Richard then released the single under his own name as the lead single for his album &quot;Real as I Wanna Be&quot;, with each reaching No. 10 in the UK on their respective charts.

In 1999, controversy again arose regarding radio stations refusing to play his releases when EMI, Richard&#x27;s label since 1958, refused to release his song, &quot;The Millennium Prayer&quot;, having judged that the song did not have commercial potential. Richard took it to an independent label, Papillon, which released the charity recording (in aid of Children&#x27;s Promise). The single went on to top the UK chart for three weeks, becoming his fourteenth and, as of December 2022, most recent No.1 single.

Richard&#x27;s next album, in 2001, was a covers project, &quot;Wanted,&quot; followed by another top ten album, &quot;Cliff at Christmas&quot;. The holiday album contained both new and older recordings, including the single &quot;Santa&#x27;s List&quot;, which reached No. 5 in 2003. Richard went to Nashville, Tennessee for his next album project in 2004, employing a writers&#x27; conclave to give him the pick of all new songs for the album &quot;Something&#x27;s Goin&#x27; On&quot;. It was another top 10 album, and produced three UK top 20 singles: &quot;Something&#x27;s Goin&#x27; On&quot;, &quot;I Cannot Give You My Love&quot;, with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees, and &quot;What Car&quot;.
On 14 June 2004, Richard joined the Shadows on-stage at the London Palladium. The Shadows had decided to re-form for another tour of the UK. It was not to be their last tour together, however, as they would re-form once again for a final tour five years later, in 2009.

&quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot;, an album of duets released in 2006, was another top 10 success for Richard and included newly recorded material with Brian May, Dionne Warwick, Anne Murray, Barry Gibb and Daniel O&#x27;Donnell, plus some previously recorded duets with artists such as Phil Everly, Elton John and Olivia Newton-John. &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot; was released to coincide with the UK leg of his latest world tour, Here and Now, which included lesser known songs such as &quot;My Kinda Life&quot;, &quot;How Did She Get Here&quot;, &quot;Hey Mr. Dream Maker&quot;, &quot;For Life&quot;, &quot;A Matter of Moments&quot;, &quot;When The Girl in Your Arms&quot; and the Christmas single &quot;21st Century Christmas&quot;, which debuted at No. 2 on the UK singles chart.

Another compilation album, &quot;Love... The Album&quot; was released on 12 November 2007. Like &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot; before it, this album includes both previously released material and newly recorded songs, namely &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot;, &quot;When You Say Nothing at All&quot;, &quot;All Out of Love&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Not the One&quot; and &quot;When I Need You&quot; (the last was released as a single, reaching No. 38; the album peaked at No. 13).

===2008–present: 50th anniversary and Shadows reunion===

2008, Richard&#x27;s 51st year in the music business saw the release of the eight-CD box set &quot;And They Said It Wouldn&#x27;t Last (My 50 Years in Music)&quot;. In September, a single celebrating his 50 years in pop music, titled &quot;Thank You for a Lifetime&quot; was released. On 14 September 2008 it reached No. 3 on the UK music charts.

On 11 November 2008, Richard&#x27;s official website announced that Cliff and the Shadows would reunite to celebrate their 50th anniversary in the music business. A month later they performed at the Royal Variety Performance. In 2009, Cliff and the Shadows brought their partnership to an end with the Golden Anniversary concert tour of the UK.

A new album, titled &quot;Reunited&quot;, by Richard and the Shadows, was released in September 2009. It was their first studio project in forty years. The 28 tracks recorded comprise 25 re-recordings of their earlier work, with three &quot;new&quot; tracks, originally from that era (and earlier), the single &quot;Singing the Blues&quot;, along with Eddie Cochran&#x27;s &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot; and the Frankie Ford hit &quot;Sea Cruise&quot;. The album charted at No. 6 in the UK charts in its opening week and peaked at No. 4. The reunion tour continued into Europe in 2010. In June 2009, it was reported by Sound Kitchen Studios in Nashville that Richard was to return there shortly to record a new album of original recordings of jazz songs. He was to record fourteen tracks in a week.
Richard performed &quot;Congratulations&quot; at the 70th birthday celebrations of Queen Margrethe II in Denmark on 13 April 2010. On 14 October 2010, Richard celebrated his 70th birthday, and to mark the occasion, he performed a series of six concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, London. To accompany the concerts, a new album of cover versions of swing standards, &quot;Bold as Brass&quot;, was released on 11 October. The official party celebrating Richard&#x27;s 70th birthday was held on 23 October 2010, with guests including Cilla Black, Elaine Paige and Daniel O&#x27;Donnell.

After a week of promotion, Richard flew out to rehearse for the German Night of the Proms concerts in Belgium at the end of October. He made a surprise appearance at the Antwerp concert of the Night of the Proms on Thursday, 28 October 2010 and sang &quot;We Don&#x27;t Talk Anymore&quot; to a great reaction from the surprised 20,000 fans at Sportpaleis Antwerp. In all, he toured 12 German cities in November and December 2010, during the Night of the Proms concerts, as the headline act. The total of 18 concerts were attended by over 300,000 fans. Richard performed a selection of hits and tracks from the &quot;Bold As Brass&quot; album. In November 2010, he achieved his third consecutive UK No. 1 music DVD in three years with the DVD release of &quot;Bold as Brass&quot;.
In October 2011, Richard released his &quot;Soulicious&quot; album, containing duets with American soul singers including Percy Sledge, Ashford and Simpson, Roberta Flack, Freda Payne and Candi Staton. The album was produced by Lamont Dozier and was supported by a short UK arena tour. &quot;Soulicious&quot; became Richard&#x27;s 41st top 10 UK hit album.

He was among the performers at the Diamond Jubilee concert held outside Buckingham Palace in June 2012. On 30 June 2012, Richard helped to carry the Olympic torch from Derby to Birmingham as part of the torch relay for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Richard said that his run with the Olympic torch would be one of his top 10 memories.

Richard was involved in a campaign to extend copyright on sound recordings in the UK from 50 to 95 years, and extend the number of years on which a musician can receive royalties. The campaign was initially unsuccessful, and the UK copyright on many of Richard&#x27;s early recordings expired in 2008. In 2013, following another campaign, copyright on sound recordings was extended to 70 years after first publication to the public for works still in copyright at that point. This means Richard&#x27;s recordings between 1958 and 1962 are out of copyright in the UK, but those from 1963 will be in copyright until 2034. In November 2013, Richard released the 100th album of his career, &quot;The Fabulous Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Songbook&quot;. By that point, Richard had released 47 studio albums, 35 compilations, 11 live albums and 7 film soundtracks.

Richard was scheduled to open for Morrissey at a live concert at New York&#x27;s 19,000-capacity Barclays Center on 21 June 2014. Morrissey said that he was &quot;honoured and thrilled&quot; to have Richard on the bill. It was reported on 16 June 2014 that Morrissey had cancelled the concert after collapsing with an &quot;acute fever&quot;. Richard announced that he would stage a free show for fans in New York on the same night the cancelled concert was due to take place.

In October 2015, Richard performed on tour to mark his 75th birthday. He took to the stage across seven cities in the UK, including six nights at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, where he has performed on over 100 occasions during his career. Richard&#x27;s 2015 tour received a positive review from &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s rock music critic Dave Simpson.
In August 2018, Richard announced the release of the album &quot;Rise Up&quot;, which includes new material. The first single of the album, &quot;Rise Up&quot;, was released in vinyl format and reached No. 1 on the UK Vinyl Singles Chart in October 2018. He performed a duet with Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler on &quot;Taking Control&quot;, which appeared on her 2019 studio album, &quot;Between the Earth and the Stars&quot;. In 2020 Richard released the album &quot;Music... The Air That I Breathe&quot;. On 4 July 2022, Richard sang his 1963 hit &quot;Summer Holiday&quot; at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, as part of the Centenary Celebration.

==Criticism of the music industry and commercial support==
Richard has openly complained about the lack of commercial support he receives from radio stations and record labels. He spoke about this on &quot;The Alan Titchmarsh Show&quot; on ITV in December 2007, pointing out that while new bands needed airplay for promotion and sales, long-established artists such as himself also relied upon airplay for the same reasons. He also noted that 1980s radio stations did play his records and that this went some way to help sales and maintain his media presence. In the BBC Radio 2 documentary &quot;Cliff – Take Another Look&quot;, he pointed out that many documentaries charting the history of British music (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m in a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Band!&quot;) fail to mention him (or the Shadows).

In 1998, Chris Evans, the then breakfast show host on Virgin Radio, vowed he would never again play a record by Richard, stating that he was &quot;too old&quot;. In June 2004, British disc jockey Tony Blackburn was suspended from his radio job at Classic Gold Digital for playing records by Richard against station policy. The head of programmes, Paul Baker, sent an e-mail to Blackburn stating that Richard &quot;doesn&#x27;t match our brand values. He&#x27;s not on the playlist, and you must stop playing him.&quot; On Blackburn&#x27;s next morning breakfast show, he read a print-out of the e-mail live on air to the show&#x27;s 400,000 listeners and went on to play two songs by Richard. Classic Gold managing director John Baish later confirmed Blackburn&#x27;s suspension from the show.

In 2011, digital station Absolute Radio &#x27;60s, dedicated to playing popular music from the 1960s, announced they would not be playing any of Richard&#x27;s records because they said they did not fit &quot;the cool sound... we&#x27;re trying to create&quot;. DJ Pete Mitchell said: &quot;Timeless acts of the decade that remain relevant today are the Beatles, the Stones, the Doors and the Who, not Sir Cliff.&quot; Richard responded to this by saying: &quot;They&#x27;re lying to themselves, and more importantly they&#x27;re lying to the public.&quot;

Richard has spoken of his irritation about other stars who are praised after taking drugs. In 2009, Richard said he was the &quot;most radical rock-and-roll singer Britain has ever seen&quot; as he did not indulge in drugs or sexual promiscuity. Richard said he is proud that he never adopted the hedonistic lifestyle of a typical rock star. He said: &quot;I&#x27;ve never wanted to trash a hotel room.&quot;

Richard has criticised the music industry for encouraging artists to court controversy. In November 2013, he said: &quot;The music industry has changed drastically and that damages young artists. This industry can be very destructive.&quot; Richard expressed concern about the sexually explicit public image of singer Miley Cyrus, following controversy surrounding a semi-naked video for her song &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;. In the 1970s, Richard said that he was disturbed by the visual imagery and mock horror of singer Alice Cooper. In 1997, Richard said of the rock band Oasis: &quot;It&#x27;s just a shame that part of what gives them their kick is their self-destructive impulse.&quot;

In an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2011, the journalist Sam Leith wrote of Richard&#x27;s lack of commercial support among radio stations: &quot;His uncompromising Christianity, his clean-living ways, and his connoisseurship of the fruits of his Portuguese winery have made him an object of incomprehension, even ridicule, for the uncultured, alcopop-drinking younger generation.&quot; Also writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, John Robb opined that because Richard has rebelled against the drink and drugs culture of typical rock stars, this &quot;rebelling against rebellion&quot; has made Richard something of a countercultural icon.

In December 2013, Richard said that he felt two of his singles, &quot;Mistletoe and Wine&quot; and &quot;The Millennium Prayer&quot;, had created a negative reaction against him. He said: &quot;Airplay is vital for single hits. The only way I can have a fair competition is if your records are on the radio. There is an ageism in the radio industry. If you ask me to record a new song, I&#x27;m not sure it would get the support it needs.&quot;

Author and rock music critic Tony Parsons said: &quot;If you don&#x27;t like at least some Cliff Richard, then you don&#x27;t like pop music&quot;. Sting also defended Richard, stating: &quot;Cliff Richard is in my opinion one of Britain&#x27;s finest singers technically and emotionally.&quot;

==Personal life==
Richard&#x27;s father, Rodger Webb, died in 1961, aged 56, which had a great impact on Richard. He later said: &quot;My father died very young. He missed the best parts of my career. When my father was sick, we became very close.&quot; Richard&#x27;s mother, Dorothy, died in October 2007, aged 87, after a decade with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In a 2006 interview, he spoke about the difficulties he and his sisters had in dealing with their mother&#x27;s condition.

Richard is a lifelong bachelor. In a three-page letter written in October 1961 to &quot;his first serious girlfriend&quot;, Australian dancer Delia Wicks, which was made public in April 2010 after her death from cancer, Richard wrote, &quot;Being a pop singer I have to give up one priceless thing – the right to any lasting relationship with any special girl. I&#x27;ve just had to make, probably, one of the biggest decisions I&#x27;m ever going to make and I&#x27;m hoping that it won&#x27;t hurt you too much.&quot; The couple had been dating for 18 months. In the letter he goes on to say, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t give up my career, besides the fact that my mother and sisters, since my father&#x27;s death, rely on me completely. I have showbiz in my blood now and I would be lost without it.&quot; Richard urged her to &quot;find someone who is free to love you as you deserve to be loved&quot; and who &quot;is able to marry you&quot;.

After Delia Wicks died in 2010, aged 71, her brother Graham Wicks said that she had been &quot;devastated&quot; by Richard&#x27;s decision to end their relationship, describing Richard as &quot;a very pleasant man&quot;.

At the age of 22, a year after his relationship with Delia Wicks ended, Richard had a brief romance with the actress Una Stubbs. Later in the 1960s, Richard considered marriage to the dancer Jackie Irving. Richard described Irving as &quot;utterly beautiful&quot; and says for a time they were &quot;inseparable&quot;. Irving went on to marry Adam Faith.

In his autobiography, Richard stressed that &quot;sex is not one of the things that drives me&quot;, but he also wrote of his seduction by Carol Costa, who at the time was the estranged wife of Jet Harris.

In the 1980s, Richard considered asking Sue Barker, a former French Open tennis champion and Wimbledon semi-finalist, if she would agree to marry him. In 2008, Richard said of his relationship with Barker: &quot;I seriously contemplated asking her to marry me, but in the end I realised that I didn&#x27;t love her quite enough to commit the rest of my life to her.&quot;

Richard first met Barker in 1982, when she was aged 25. Their romance attracted considerable media attention after Richard flew to Denmark to watch her play in a tennis match and they were later photographed cuddling and holding hands at Wimbledon. In an interview in February 1983, Richard spoke of the possibility of marriage with her. He said: &quot;I&#x27;m seeing Sue, the only girl I want to see at the moment and if marriage comes on the horizon, I shall relish it.&quot; In September 1983, Richard said that he had no immediate plans to marry Barker. He said: &quot;It&#x27;s not vital to get married and it&#x27;s not vital to be a father. But I would like to settle down and have a family one day.&quot; In July 1984, Barker said of her romance with Richard: &quot;I love him, he&#x27;s great and I&#x27;m sure we love each other.&quot;

In 1986, after Richard&#x27;s romance with Barker had ended and she began dating tennis player Stephen Shaw, Richard said that he was still a friend of Barker. He said: &quot;We have a mutual respect for each other and that means a lot to me.&quot;

When later asked why he has never married, Richard said: &quot;I&#x27;ve had a few false alarms. I&#x27;ve been in love, but marriage is a big commitment and being an artist consumes a great deal of time.&quot; He said that in the early 1970s he was in love with the singer and actress Olivia Newton-John. Richard said: &quot;At the time when I and many of us were in love with Olivia she was engaged to someone else. I&#x27;m afraid I lost the chance.&quot;

In 1988, Richard&#x27;s nephew, Philip Harrison, spent the first four months of his life in a children&#x27;s hospital suffering from serious breathing problems. Richard later helped to raise money for the hospital in east London and said that his nephew &quot;had a terrible time but the hospital saved his life&quot;.

Although he has never married, Richard has rarely lived alone. For many years, he shared his main home with his charity and promotion schedules manager, Bill Latham, and Latham&#x27;s mother. In 1982, Richard described them as his &quot;second family&quot;. Latham&#x27;s girlfriend, Jill, also lived at the house in Weybridge, Surrey, with them for a time. In 1993, Bill Latham said of Richard&#x27;s bachelor status: &quot;His freedom has meant that he has been able to do much more than if he had a family. He always goes the extra mile. If he was to have a relationship, he would give it everything. So because his commitments have been his career, his faith, and more latterly, tennis, he has given himself wholeheartedly to those three activities.&quot;

Richard often declines discussion about close relationships, and when asked about suggestions that he may be homosexual has stated categorically that he is not. When the suggestions were first put to him in the late 1970s, Richard responded by saying: &quot;It&#x27;s untrue. People are very unfair with their criticism and their judgements. I&#x27;ve had girlfriends. But people seem to think that if a bloke doesn&#x27;t sleep around he must be gay. Marriage is a very special thing to me. I&#x27;m certainly not going to do it just to make other people feel satisfied.&quot; In 1986, Richard said that rumours about his being homosexual had previously been &quot;very painful&quot; to him.

When asked in 1992 if he had ever considered the possibility that he might be gay, he responded: &quot;No&quot;. Richard said: &quot;Even if I got married tomorrow there would be a group of people who would believe what they wanted to believe. All that counts is what your family and friends know and they all trust and respect me. What the people outside think, I have no control over.&quot; Later in 1996, Richard said: &quot;I&#x27;m aware of the rumours, but I am not gay.&quot; In 1997, he said: &quot;People who are single shouldn&#x27;t have to be second-class citizens – we needn&#x27;t be embarrassed or feel guilty about it, we all have a role to play.&quot;

Richard said that his faith in God was tested in 1999 after the murder of his close friend, the British television presenter Jill Dando. He said: &quot;I was really angry with God. It shook me rigid that someone as beautiful, talented and harmless could have been killed.&quot; Richard said that Dando had many likeable qualities and described her as &quot;a very genuine person&quot;. He said of Dando&#x27;s murder: &quot;It is very difficult to understand and I find it all very confusing.&quot; He attended her funeral in May 1999 in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.

Richard has spoken of his friendship with John McElynn, an American former missionary whom he met in 2001 on a visit to New York City. In 2008, Richard said: &quot;John now spends most of his time looking after my properties, which means I don&#x27;t have to. John and I have over time struck up a close friendship. He has also become a companion, which is great because I don&#x27;t like living alone, even now.&quot;

In an interview with David Frost in 2002, Richard said that his many good friends have prevented him from feeling lonely and he has always got someone he can talk to. Richard has been a family friend of the Northern Irish broadcaster Gloria Hunniford for over fifty years. When Hunniford&#x27;s daughter Caron Keating was diagnosed with breast cancer and chose to keep her illness private from the public, Richard was among a small close circle of friends who knew of Keating&#x27;s condition. When Keating died in April 2004, Richard attended her funeral in Kent and performed his song &quot;Miss You Nights&quot; in tribute to her.

In 2006, Richard received a Portuguese Order in which he was appointed Commander of the Order of Prince Henry (ComIH), in recognition of his forty years of personal and business involvement in that country, which included investments in winemaking and a house in the Algarve, where he has spent part of the year throughout the decades. Richard finished No. 56 in the 2002 100 Greatest Britons list, sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the public.

In his 2008 autobiography, Richard wrote that his views on certain issues are less judgemental than when he was younger. He called on the Church of England to affirm people&#x27;s commitment in same-sex marriage. He wrote: &quot;In the end, I believe, people are going to be judged for what they are. It seems to me that commitment is the issue, and if anyone comes to me and says: &#x27;This is my partner – we are committed to each other,&#x27; then I don&#x27;t care what their sexuality is. I&#x27;m not going to judge – I&#x27;ll leave that to God.&quot;

In 2009, the British media reported on a growing friendship between Richard and Cilla Black. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said that Richard and Black looked at properties together in Miami and were regularly seen together in Barbados, where they both owned villas. Richard and Black reportedly enjoyed each other&#x27;s company dining together in Marbella and watching tennis in the Royal Box at Wimbledon. After Black died in August 2015, Richard described her as &quot;incredibly gifted&quot; and &quot;full of heart&quot;. He said: &quot;She was a very special person, and I have lost a very wonderful friend. I will miss her dearly.&quot; Richard performed the song &quot;Faithful One&quot; in tribute to Black at her funeral in Liverpool.

In 2010, Richard confirmed that he is no longer a resident of the United Kingdom and had been granted citizenship by Barbados. He said: &quot;I&#x27;m officially a non-resident [of the UK], although I will always be British and proud of it.&quot; He currently divides his time between living in Barbados and Portugal. When asked in February 2013 if he had regrets about not starting a family, Richard said that if he had been married with children he could not have devoted so much time to his career. He said: &quot;My three sisters have children, and it&#x27;s been wonderful to watch them grow up, get married and start families of their own. I&#x27;ve made sure I&#x27;ve always played a part in their lives. So while I think I would have been a good father, I&#x27;ve given myself to my family and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. My &#x27;freedom&#x27; allows me to continue my career. Had I been married, with children, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do what I do now.&quot;

===Nationwide Festival of Light===

In 1971, Richard was a leading supporter of the Nationwide Festival of Light, a movement formed by British Christians who were concerned about the development of the permissive society. Richard joined public figures such as Malcolm Muggeridge, Mary Whitehouse and Bishop Trevor Huddleston to demonstrate in London &quot;for love and family life, against pornography and moral pollution&quot;. Muggeridge criticised the media as being &quot;largely in the hands of those who for one reason or another favour the present Gadarene slide into decadence and Godlessness&quot;.

One of the targets for the Festival of Light&#x27;s campaign was the growth of sexually explicit films. Richard was one of approximately 30,000 people who gathered at London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square for a demonstration. One focus of their protest was against the Swedish sex education film &quot;Language of Love&quot;, which was showing at a nearby cinema.

===Philanthropy===

Since March 1966, Richard has followed the practice of giving away at least one-tenth of his income to charity. Richard has stated that two biblical principles have guided him in how to use his money. He said: &quot;Firstly, it was the love of money (not money itself) that was the root of all evil. Secondly, to be good and responsible stewards of what was entrusted to us.&quot; In 1990, Richard said: &quot;Those of us who have something to offer have to be prepared to give all the time.&quot;

For over forty years, Richard has been a supporter of Tearfund, a Christian charity that aims to tackle poverty in many countries across the world. He has made overseas visits to see their work in Uganda, Bangladesh and Brazil. Richard has said: &quot;Playing a part in relieving poverty is, as I see it, the responsibility of us all.&quot;

Richard has donated to the dementia research charity, Alzheimer&#x27;s Research UK. He has helped to raise funds and awareness of the disease by speaking publicly about his mother&#x27;s condition.

Richard has also supported numerous UK charities over many years through the Cliff Richard Charitable Trust, both through donations and by making personal visits to schools, churches, hospitals, and homes for special needs children. Richard&#x27;s passion for tennis, which was encouraged by his former girlfriend, Sue Barker, also led him in 1991 to establish the Cliff Richard Tennis Foundation. The charity has encouraged thousands of primary schools in the UK to introduce the sport, with over 200,000 children taking part in the tennis sessions which tour the country. The foundation has since become part of the charitable wing of the Lawn Tennis Association.

===Scottish independence referendum===

In August 2014, Richard was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

==Property search, investigation and BBC litigation==

In August 2014, Richard&#x27;s apartment in Berkshire was searched after a complaint to the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Operation Yewtree, which investigated sexual misconduct allegations in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Richard was not arrested, and strongly denied the allegations. The BBC was criticised for its coverage of the search. The former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, QC, criticised the police force for its &quot;completely disreputable conduct&quot; and said its action could make the warrant unlawful. Richard pulled out of a visit to the US Open tennis championships, turned down the freedom of his adopted Portuguese home city of Albufeira, and cancelled a scheduled appearance at Canterbury Cathedral because he did not want the event to be &quot;overshadowed by the false allegation&quot;. He subsequently returned to the UK and voluntarily met with and was interviewed by members of South Yorkshire Police. He was never arrested or criminally charged. Subsequently, David Crompton, chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, was criticised for his interactions with the BBC, and publicly apologised to Richard.

In February 2015, South Yorkshire Police announced that the inquiry into the alleged offences had increased, and would be continuing. Richard subsequently released a statement maintaining that the allegations were &quot;absurd and untrue&quot;. The development came a day after an independent report had concluded that South Yorkshire Police had &quot;interfered with the singer&#x27;s privacy&quot; by telling the BBC about the August 2014 property search. A review by former chief constable Andy Trotter said South Yorkshire Police had breached police guidance on protecting the identity of those under investigation and the handling of the search had dented the force&#x27;s reputation. The BBC&#x27;s tip-off regarding the search reportedly came from within Operation Yewtree, although Crompton said he could not be certain that the leak originated from there.

In May 2016, South Yorkshire Police sent a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. The following month, the CPS announced that after reviewing &quot;evidence relating to claims of non-recent sexual offences dating between 1958 and 1983 made by four men&quot;, there was &quot;insufficient evidence&quot; to charge Richard with an offence, and that no further action against him would be taken. Richard said he was &quot;obviously thrilled that the vile accusations and the resulting investigation have finally been brought to a close&quot;. But he said his naming by the media, despite not being charged, meant he had been &quot;hung out like live bait&quot;. South Yorkshire Police later &quot;apologised wholeheartedly&quot; to Richard after its investigation into the singer was dropped on 16 June 2016. Richard commented: &quot;My reputation will not be fully vindicated because the CPS&#x27;s policy is to only say something general about there being &#x27;insufficient&#x27; evidence. How can there be evidence for something that never took place?&quot; It was subsequently reported that during the 22-month police investigation a man was arrested over a plot to blackmail Richard. The unnamed man in his forties contacted Richard&#x27;s aides and threatened to spread &quot;false stories&quot; unless he received a sum of money.

On 21 June 2016, the BBC apologised publicly to Richard for causing distress after the controversial broadcast. On 27 September 2016, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that the decision not to prosecute Richard over claims of historical sex offences had been upheld. The CPS reviewed the evidence following applications by two of his accusers, and concluded that the decision not to charge Richard was correct. In October 2016, it was reported that Richard was suing the BBC and South Yorkshire Police. Legal papers were filed at the High Court in London on 6 October 2016. South Yorkshire Police later agreed to pay Richard £400,000 after settling a claim he brought against the force.

On 12 April 2018, the case against the BBC opened in the High Court. It was reported that Richard was seeking &quot;very substantial&quot; damages. On 13 April, Richard gave evidence for more than an hour, describing the television coverage as &quot;shocking and upsetting&quot;. His written statement was made available online by his lawyers, Simkins LLP. On 18 July 2018, Richard won his High Court case against the BBC and was awarded £210,000 in damages. On 15 August 2018, the BBC stated they would not appeal against the judgment. The BBC repeated an apology for the distress that Richard had been through. &quot;The Guardian&quot; estimated that the BBC&#x27;s costs for legal fees and damages had reached £1.9 million after losing the case.

== Cultural significance and impact ==
Cliff Richard&#x27;s 1958 hit &quot;Move It&quot; is widely regarded as the first authentic British rock and roll record, and &quot;laid the foundations&quot; for the Beatles and Merseybeat music. John Lennon reportedly said of Richard that before Cliff and the Shadows, there had been nothing worth listening to in British music. His successful performing and recording career in the UK has extended over six decades.

<text>Vincenzo &quot;Enzo&quot; Daniele Scifo (; born 19 February 1966) is a retired Belgian football midfielder. He has also managed the Belgium national under-21 football team and several Belgian club sides. He played for clubs in Belgium, France and Italy, where he won several domestic titles. At international level, he was a member of the Belgium national team, for which he appeared in four FIFA World Cups, being one of three Belgian players ever to do so.

== Early life ==
Scifo was born in La Louvière, Wallonia, to Italian parents from Sicily. He proved himself a highly promising talent in youth football and was nicknamed &quot;Little Pelé&quot; at his local team, where he scored 432 goals in only four seasons as a junior. Scifo joined his local club R.A.A. Louviéroise as a seven-year-old in 1973. He transferred to what used to be Belgium&#x27;s most successful club, R.S.C. Anderlecht, in 1982.

== Club career ==
Scifo made his first team debut with R.S.C. Anderlecht in 1983, at the age of 17. After winning three Belgian First Division championships with the club, and helping the team to the 1984 UEFA Cup Final, only to lose out to Tottenham on penalties, Scifo earned a reputation as one of the most promising young stars of his generation, and moved to his ancestral country for Internazionale in 1987 for a fee of 7.5 billion Lire. At the time, this was the record amount for a football transfer. After an unsuccessful spell in Inter Milan, which saw him manage only four league goals in 28 appearances, he moved to French club Bordeaux in 1988 where he again disappointed, and faced injuries and conflict with senior squad members. His career was revived by a successful move to Auxerre in 1989, at the age of 23, under manager Guy Roux, which led to a return to Italy with Torino in 1991; his second spell in Serie A was more successful, as he reached the 1992 UEFA Cup Final in his first season with Torino, and won the Coppa Italia the following season. Scifo then moved to AS Monaco in 1993, where he enjoyed a similar level of success and won the French championship in 1997. He returned to Anderlecht later that year and won his fourth Belgian league title in the 1999–2000 season. He joined Charleroi in 2000, but retired later in the same season, at the age of 36, after being diagnosed with chronic arthritis. In total, Scifo scored 121 league goals in 478 official matches.

== International career ==
Scifo made his senior international debut on 6 June 1984 for Belgium, in a 2–2 friendly draw against Hungary. In Belgium&#x27;s opening group match of UEFA Euro 1984, on 13 June, he attracted much publicity when he helped his team to a 2–0 victory over Yugoslavia; at the age of 18 years and 115 days, he was the youngest player ever to appear in the finals at the time. Scifo featured in all three of Belgium&#x27;s group matches in the tournament, as they placed third in their group and suffered a first round elimination.

He appeared for Belgium in the 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998 World Cups, playing sixteen games in total; he is one of only 14 players to have participated in four World Cups, and one of only three Belgian players ever to do so. Scifo helped his nation to the semi-finals of the 1986 edition of the tournament in Mexico, playing in all seven of his team&#x27;s matches and scoring two goals as Belgium finished the tournament in fourth place; he was named the best young player of the tournament for his performances throughout the competition. In the 1990 edition of the tournament, held in Italy, Scifo scored a notable goal from long range in Belgium&#x27;s 3-1 first round victory over Uruguay, on 17 June, held in Verona; the goal was later elected as the tenth greatest FIFA World Cup goal of the Century in a 2002 poll, with 2,935 votes. Belgium were eventually eliminated in the second round against England; four years later, at U.S.A. &#x27;94, the Belgian side were once again eliminated in the second round. Scifo retired from international football after Belgium&#x27;s first round elimination in the 1998 World Cup held in France; in total he gained eighty-four international caps and scored eighteen goals.

== Style of play ==
A highly creative midfielder with an eye for goal, Scifo was a classic number 10 playmaker who usually played as an attacking midfielder behind the strikers; he was also capable of playing as a central midfielder, where he functioned as a deep-lying playmaker, or as a wide midfielder along the right flank. Considered one of Belgium&#x27;s greatest ever players, his primary traits as a footballer were his excellent vision, tactical intelligence, and technical skills, which allowed him to orchestrate his team&#x27;s attacking moves from midfield; he was also highly regarded for his balance on the ball, and his ability to dribble with his head up, as well as his accurate shooting and passing ability with his right foot, which enabled him both to score goals or create chances for his teammates. However, despite his talent, he was also criticised by his managers at times for his poor defensive work-rate off the ball, his introverted character, and for being selfish and inefficient at times, in particular in his youth, as he attempted too many individual dribbling runs, rather than looking to provide a simpler pass to an open teammate. Throughout his career, his unique playing style drew comparisons with Gianni Rivera, Giancarlo Antognoni, and his idol Michel Platini.

== After retirement ==
Scifo tried his hand at coaching with R. Charleroi S.C., joining them for the 2000–01 season. Indifferent results led to his resignation in June 2002. He later coached Tubize between 2004 and 2006, and later became head trainer of R.E. Mouscron, another Belgian League team, in 2007. On 6 June 2009, Scifo quit Mouscron due to the club&#x27;s difficult financial situation.

In May 2006, he was part of the historic first European Selection, led by former England manager Terry Venables and Josep Mª Fusté which had its début in Eindhoven in the first EFPA Match.

Scifo returned to club football with Mons between 2012 and 2013. Between 2015 and 2016, he served as the manager of the Belgium U21 national team.

<doc id="52266" wikidata="Q32929" url="?curid=52266" title="War of the Austrian Succession">
<text>The War of the Austrian Succession was a European conflict fought between 1740 and 1748, primarily in Central Europe, the Austrian Netherlands, Italy, the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Related conflicts include King George&#x27;s War in North America, the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, the First Carnatic War, and the First and Second Silesian Wars.

Its pretext was the right of Maria Theresa to succeed her father, Emperor Charles VI, as ruler of the Habsburg monarchy. France, Prussia, and Bavaria saw it as an opportunity to challenge Habsburg power, while Maria Theresa was backed by Britain, the Dutch Republic, and Hanover, collectively known as the Pragmatic Allies. As the conflict widened, it drew in other participants, among them Spain, Sardinia, Saxony, Sweden, and Russia.

Prussia occupied the Austrian province of Silesia in 1740, although Austria and Sardinia defeated Spanish attacks in Northern Italy. By early 1748, France held most of the Austrian Netherlands, but was close to bankruptcy due to the cost of the war and a crippling British naval blockade. The stalemate led to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle which confirmed Maria Theresa in her titles but failed to resolve underlying tensions between the signatories, many of whom were unhappy with the terms. France achieved minimal gains for vast expenditure, while the Spanish gained the Duchies of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla.

Prussia, often considered the clearest winner, acquired Silesia from Austria, an outcome that undermined the long-standing Anglo-Austrian Alliance, since Maria Theresa deeply resented Britain&#x27;s insistence she cede Silesia to make peace and made it her main objective to regain it. At the same time, the war demonstrated that Hanover, then held in personal union with the British Crown, was vulnerable to Prussian attacks, while many British politicians felt they received little benefit from the enormous subsidies paid to Austria. The result was the realignment known as the Diplomatic Revolution. Austria and France ended the rivalry which had dominated European affairs for centuries, while Prussia allied with Great Britain. These changes set the scene for the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756.

==Background==
The immediate cause of the war was the death in 1740 of Emperor Charles VI (1685–1740) and the inheritance of the Habsburg monarchy, often collectively referred to as Austria. The 1703 Mutual Pact of Succession provided that if the Habsburgs became extinct in the male line, these possessions would go first to Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia, daughters of Emperor Joseph I, then those of Charles, his younger brother. Since Salic law excluded women from the inheritance, this agreement required approval by the various Habsburg territories and the Imperial Diet.

Charles succeeded Joseph in 1711 and two years later issued the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, which confirmed the principle of female inheritance. However, it also modified the 1703 agreement by placing the rights of his own children first and after his first child Maria Theresa was born in 1717, Charles&#x27; internal and external policy was dominated by ensuring her succession ahead of his two nieces. Prior to their respective marriages to Frederick Augustus of Saxony and Charles Albert of Bavaria in 1719, both nieces were obliged to formally renounce their rights to the inheritance. Charles assumed the rivalry between Saxony and Bavaria would secure his daughter&#x27;s throne, since neither would be prepared to allow the other to inherit, but instead he gave his two greatest rivals a claim to the Habsburg lands.

Charles was also seeking to ensure the succession of Maria Theresa not just to her family lands but the titles and powers of the Holy Roman Emperor. Although held by a Habsburg for over 300 years, it was an elective position and could not be held by a woman. The problem was exacerbated by tensions within the Holy Roman Empire, caused by dramatic increases in the size and power of Bavaria, Prussia, and Saxony, mirrored by the post-1683 expansion of Habsburg power into lands previously held by the Ottoman Empire. These were the centrifugal forces behind a war that reshaped the traditional European balance of power; the various legal claims were largely pretexts and seen as such.

Bavaria and Saxony refused to be bound by the decision of the Imperial Diet, while in 1738 France agreed to back the &#x27;just claims&#x27; of Charles Albert of Bavaria despite previously accepting the Pragmatic Sanction in 1735. Attempts to offset this involved Austria in the 1733–1735 War of the Polish Succession and the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739, and it was weakened by the losses incurred. The situation was compounded by a failure to prepare Maria Theresa for her new role, and many European statesmen were skeptical Austria could survive the contest that would follow Charles&#x27; death, which finally came about in October 1740.

==Strategies==
On land, fighting focused on three main theatres, Central Europe, Italy, and the Austrian Netherlands, along with a wider naval conflict. The war itself can be divided into three separate but connected conflicts, the first being the Silesian Wars between Prussia and Austria. In the second, Austria and Sardinia defeated Spanish attacks in Northern Italy, while the third featured an increasingly global contest between Britain and France. In the end, French conquest of the Austrian Netherlands gave them clear dominance on land, while Britain&#x27;s victories at sea cemented its place as the dominant naval power.

For much of the 18th century, French military strategy focused on potential threats on its eastern and northern borders, which required a strong land army. Its colonies were left to fend for themselves, or given minimal resources, anticipating they would likely be lost anyway. This strategy was driven by a combination of geography, and the superiority of the British navy, which made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to French colonies. The expectation was military victory in Europe would compensate for any colonial losses; in 1748, France recovered possessions like Louisbourg, in return for withdrawing from the Austrian Netherlands.

The British tried to avoid large-scale commitments of troops on the Continent. They sought to offset the disadvantage this created in Europe by allying themselves with one or more Continental powers whose interests were antithetical to those of their enemies, particularly France. In the War of the Austrian Succession, the British were allied with Austria; by the time of the Seven Years&#x27; War, they were allied with its enemy, Prussia. In contrast to France, once Britain became engaged in the war, it took advantage of the Royal Navy to expand it into the colonies. The British pursued a dual strategy of naval blockade and bombardment of enemy ports, and also utilized their ability to move troops by sea to the utmost. They would harass enemy shipping and attack enemy outposts, frequently using colonists from nearby British colonies in the effort. This plan worked better in North America than in Europe, but set the stage for the Seven Years&#x27; War.

==Campaign of 1740==
Frederick II succeeded his father Frederick William as king of Prussia on 31 May 1740 at the age of 28. Although Prussia had increased in importance over the prior few decades, its disparate and scattered territories prevented it wielding significant power, a reality Frederick intended to change. The death of Emperor Charles VI on 20 October 1740 provided him with an ideal opportunity to acquire Silesia, but he needed to do so before Augustus of Saxony and Poland could pre-empt him.

With a population of 16 million, Austria had an authorised standing army of 157,000, although financial restraints meant its true size was considerably less than that in 1740. Since they had a much greater area to defend, their army was more of &quot;a sieve&quot; than a shield against foreign invasion. In contrast, the Prussian Army was better trained and led than its opponents, while its standing army of 80,000 was disproportionately large, at around 4% of its 2.2 million population. To add to these advantages, in April 1739 Frederick ensured Austria faced war on two fronts when Louis XV of France agreed to attack from the west, while Prussia did so from the north.

In early December 1740, the Prussian army assembled along the river Oder and on 16 December invaded Silesia without a formal declaration of war. Since Austrian military resources were concentrated in Hungary and Italy, they had fewer than 3,000 troops in Silesia, although this increased to 7,000 shortly before the invasion. They held on to the fortresses of Glogau, Breslau, and Brieg, but abandoned the rest of the province and withdrew into Moravia, with both sides taking up winter quarters. In under two weeks Prussia had occupied most of the richest province in the Holy Roman Empire, containing a population of over one million, and the commercial centre of Breslau along with mining, weaving and dyeing industries. However, Frederick underestimated Maria Theresa&#x27;s determination to reverse her loss, while the retention of Austrian fortresses in Southern Silesia meant a quick victory could not be achieved.

==Campaign of 1741==

Early in the year, an Austrian army under von Neipperg relieved Neisse, and marched on Brieg, threatening to cut the Prussians off. On 10 April, just outside Brieg, they were defeated at the Battle of Mollwitz; Frederick made serious mistakes in his first battle, and was so close to defeat that his subordinates ordered him to avoid capture and leave the battlefield. His deputy von Schwerin managed to drag out a victory, both sides losing nearly 25% of their strength.

On 5 June, Frederick signed an alliance against Austria with France, who crossed the Rhine on 15 August. A combined Franco-Bavarian force now advanced along the Danube, towards Vienna, capturing Linz on 14 September. Joined by a Saxon army of 20,000, they advanced on Prague from three different points, initially meeting little resistance. Before long, the Austrians had an army at Tábor, while Neipperg was recalled from Silesia to defend Vienna. Apparently close to defeat, on 21 September Maria Theresa made an emotional speech to the Hungarian Diet in Pressburg. They approved a &quot;levée en masse&quot;, which ultimately produced 22,000 troops, rather than the promised 60,000, but was an assertion of loyalty long remembered.

Maria Theresa was also helped by deep divisions among her opponents and Frederick&#x27;s duplicity. Hoping to weaken Saxony, on 9 October he signed the Klein–Schnellendorf agreement with Neipperg and in what is now considered a memorable act of diplomatic subterfuge, the Austrians surrendered Neisse after a mock defence. Under the prevailing rules of war, this allowed them to receive a pass to the nearest friendly territory and thus be used against Prussia&#x27;s allies elsewhere, rather than being taken prisoner. Her best general, von Khevenhüller incorporated them into an army being assembled for a winter offensive to retake Upper Austria, and attack Bavaria.

While Frederick completed his conquest of Silesia, a French force under Maurice de Saxe took Prague on 26 November 1741, allowing the Bavarian elector, Charles Albert, to be crowned King of Bohemia. The year ended with Khevenhüller decisively defeating a bigger Franco-Bavarian army at Sankt Pölten and advancing up the Danube towards Linz, while a second column under Johann Bärenklau moved through the Tyrol, towards Munich.

==Campaign of 1742==
On 17 January, von Khevenhüller defeated a Bavarian army at Schärding while seven days later 10,000 French soldiers surrendered at Linz. On 12 February, Charles Albert of Bavaria was crowned Emperor Charles VII, the first non-Habsburg to hold the position in 300 years, although Bärenklau captured Munich the same day. Although technically all allies, Prussia, Saxony and Bavaria had no desire to see France established in the Empire, nor to see one another gain relative ground. Maria Theresa ended Austria&#x27;s secret truce with Frederick, first releasing the details. The Austrians assembled a second army of 28,000 to retake Prague, under Charles of Lorraine.
News of the secret truce badly damaged the relationship between Frederick and his allies, but Emperor Charles asked him to relieve the pressure by invading Moravia. Frederick had used the interval to reorganise his cavalry, previously neglected in favour of the infantry, and who performed poorly at Mollwitz; they would prove more effective in the 1742 campaign.

In December 1741, von Schwerin had captured Olmütz; Frederick took Glatz, before moving onto Groß Seelowitz in March 1742. This allowed him to threaten Vienna; a few Prussian patrols even appeared in the suburbs, before withdrawing. In early May, he took the offensive, and moved into north-east Bohemia; by 16 May, he had 10,000 infantry at Kuttenberg, and another 18,000 men under Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau a day&#x27;s march behind.

On the afternoon of 16 May, Charles of Lorraine&#x27;s cavalry ran into Leopold&#x27;s rearguard. Leopold recognized he was in contact with the Austrian main force and so accelerated his march ahead to close the gap with Frederick. At 2:00 am on 17 May, his exhausted troops stopped at the small village of Chotusitz, still three hours from Kutná Hora. Fought later the same day, the Battle of Chotusitz was inconclusive, but technically a Prussian victory, since the Austrians withdrew. On 24 May, French Field Marshal de Broglie won a minor action at Sahay. The two victories left the strategic situation unchanged, since Charles was still able to move against Prague, while the Prussian presence in Moravia remained a threat to Vienna.

However, Habsburg policy was generally to avoid fighting on too many fronts at the same time; Prussia was the most dangerous, and most difficult to defeat. Although recovering Silesia remained a priority for decades, Maria Theresa was willing to agree a temporary truce with Prussia to improve her position elsewhere. This suited Frederick, who was short of money and men and also suspected France was preparing a separate peace. In June, the Treaty of Breslau ended the First Silesian War; Prussian troops withdrew from Bohemia, and Austria recaptured Prague in December.

==Campaign of 1743==
At the beginning of the year, Louis XV insisted Broglie be given command of the Franco-Bavarian forces, creating tension with the Bavarians, and their general von Seckendorff. With most of his lands occupied by the Austrians, Charles VII fled to Augsburg, from where he initiated talks with Vienna and London, feeling he had been abandoned by his French allies. Divided at the top, and their troops weakened by disease, the Franco-Bavarian forces offered limited resistance to the Austrian advance; on 9 May, the Bavarians were defeated outside Simbach, by Charles of Lorraine.

In mid-June, the Pragmatic Army arrived at Aschaffenburg, on the north bank of the river Main. Here they were joined by George II, who was attending the enthronement of a new Elector of Mainz in Wiesbaden. By late June, the Allies were running short of supplies and withdrew towards the nearest supply depot at Hanau, the road to which ran through Dettingen, now a part of Karlstein am Main, where 23,000 French troops blocked the road. Despite a strong position, mistakes made by their commander Gramont, allowed the Allies to win a narrow victory. This was the last time a British monarch would personally lead troops in battle. 

While the Pragmatic Army were able to continue their retreat, they had to abandon their wounded, and although reinforced by Charles of Lorraine were unable to agree what to do next. Charles later described Allied headquarters as a &#x27;republic&#x27;, while Adrien Maurice de Noailles told Louis XV he was &#x27;heavily indebted to the irresolutions of George II.&#x27; They ended by doing nothing, and in October, took up winter quarters in the Netherlands.
Frederick had responded to Dettingen by renewing his search for allies, and building up his army once again. In July, the Russian court discovered an alleged plot to overthrow Empress Elizabeth, and restore three-year old Ivan VI, with his mother Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna as his regent. Whether this amounted to anything more than drunken gossip is disputed; one suggestion is that it was a fabrication by Frederick, designed to remove anti-Prussian opponents, chiefly Chancellor Bestuzhev-Ryumin.

Anna Bestuzhev, wife of his brother Mikhail, and her friend Natalia Lopukhina, confessed to the plot after 25 days of torture; they were publicly flogged, and had their tongues removed before being exiled to Siberia. Fredrick&#x27;s supporters referred to it as the &quot;Botta Conspiracy&quot;, alleging the involvement of Austrian envoy Antoniotto Botta Adorno. When Tsarina Elizabeth demanded Botta be punished, Maria Theresa refused, and the episode poisoned the relationship between Austria and Russia. Frederick managed to divide his two main opponents, but Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin remained in place, leaving the overall position unchanged.

On 13 September, Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, Maria Theresa and Britain agreed the Treaty of Worms, intended to expel Spain from Italy. In return for Sardinian support in Lombardy, the Austrians ceded all their territories west of the river Ticino and Lake Maggiore, along with lands south of the Po. In return, Charles Emmanuel renounced his claim to the strategic Duchy of Milan, guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction, and provided 40,000 troops, paid for by Britain.

France and Spain responded with the Second Pacte de Famille in October, and Louis XV began plans to invade the Austrian Netherlands. The year ended with Saxony agreeing a pact of mutual defence with Austria, leaving Prussia isolated, and facing a renewed offensive as Maria Theresa sought to regain Silesia.

==Campaign of 1744==
Under the 1743 Treaty of Fontainebleau, Louis XV and his uncle, Philip V of Spain agreed on joint action against Britain. This included a proposed invasion of Britain, aimed at restoring the exiled Stuarts, and over the winter, 12,000 French troops and transports were assembled at Dunkirk.

In the February 1744 Battle of Toulon, a combined Franco-Spanish fleet fought an indecisive action with a British naval force commanded by Admiral Mathews. Although Mathews prevented them exiting the Mediterranean and supporting the invasion attempt, he was forced to retreat, which led to his dismissal. Success allowed Spain to land troops in Northern Italy, and in April they captured the important port of Villefranche-sur-Mer, then part of Savoy.

However, storms sank or severely damaged many French ships, while most of Louis&#x27; ministers opposed what they considered an expensive and futile diversion of resources. The invasion was cancelled on 11 March, Louis formally declared war on Britain, and in May, a French army invaded the Austrian Netherlands. As in 1744, they were greatly helped by divisions between the Pragmatic Allies, making it very difficult to formulate a consistent strategy. The British and Hanoverians detested each other, Austrian resources were focused in Alsace, while the Dutch were reluctant to declare war on France, and unsuccessfully tried to persuade Louis to withdraw. The Dutch however did want to protect their Barrier fortresses and Isaac Cronström thus argued to engage the French in the open field. George Wade, supreme commander of the allied army, disagreed. He was under strict orders of the British government to not risk losing his connection to Ostend and not to risk British or Hanoverians troops becoming prisoners of war, which also meant that he refused to put them on garrison duty. The British feared another Jacobite uprising and therefore wanted to be able to send their troops home in time.

As a result, the French made rapid progress, quickly capturing most of the Dutch-held Barrier fortresses along the border, including Menen and Ypres. When an Austrian army under Prince Charles of Lorraine invaded Alsace in early June, Louis went on the defensive in the Southern Netherlands, and travelled to Metz to meet this threat. In early August, he fell dangerously ill with smallpox, a disease often fatal at the time; although he later recovered, this temporarily paralysed the French command system.

With the bulk of the Austrian army occupied in Eastern France, Frederick launched the Second Silesian War on 15 August, and by the end of the month, all 80,000 of his troops were in Bohemia. Although Maria Theresa&#x27;s main objective was to regain Silesia, the speed of the Prussian advance took the Austrians by surprise. On 23 August, Prince Charles withdrew from Alsace to defend Bohemia, with little interference from the French due to Louis&#x27; illness.
By mid-September, Frederick had captured Prague, Tabor, Budweis and Frauenberg; he now advanced up the river Moldau, hoping to catch the Austrians between his forces, and the Franco-Bavarian army he assumed was in pursuit. However, the Bavarians contented themselves with re-occupying Munich, while the French settled down to besiege Freiburg im Breisgau, a town of far less importance to Maria Theresa than Bohemia.

Frederick was left dangerously exposed, a situation worsened in early October when Saxony joined the coalition against him as an active belligerent. Under pressure from Charles of Lorraine and a combined Austro-Saxon force under Count Traun, the Prussians were forced to retreat; by the time they entered Silesia in late November, Frederick&#x27;s army was reduced to 36,000, half of whom then died of dysentery.

Despite the surrender of Freiburg and French advances in the Southern Netherlands, Austria seemed well-positioned at the end of 1744. Frederick&#x27;s retreat damaged his reputation and weakened his army, but the most significant impact was on Franco-Prussian relations, with Louis accused of failing to support Prussia.

In Italy, an Austrian attack on the Kingdom of Naples was unsuccessful, largely due to the incompetence of their commanders. In the north, arguments over strategy, and Spanish accusations of French cowardice at Toulon prevented them from taking full advantage of their victories earlier in the year. This was offset by similar divisions among their opponents; Charles Emmanuel was reluctant to see the Bourbons expelled from Italy, leaving the Habsburgs as the dominant power, while his territorial ambitions could only be achieved at Austrian expense. As a result, neither side could make significant progress in this area.

==Campaign of 1745==

Frederick&#x27;s position continued to deteriorate; on 8 January, Austria, Britain, the Dutch Republic and Saxony signed the Treaty of Warsaw, which was clearly aimed at Prussia. This was accompanied by ominous signs of Russian military activity in Livonia, followed by the death of Emperor Charles VII on 20 January. Since Maria Theresa&#x27;s husband, Grand Duke Francis, was the best-supported candidate to replace him, this was a major setback for the Franco-Prussian alliance.

Charles&#x27; son and heir, Maximilian III Joseph made one last effort to drive the Austrians out of Bavaria, but his demoralised and ill-equipped army was out-manoeuvered by Count Batthyány, while a Franco-Bavarian army was defeated at Pfaffenhofen on 15 April. With most of his electorate once again occupied, on 22 April he signed the Treaty of Füssen, in which he agreed to vote for Francis Stephen as Emperor, and made peace with Austria. Prussia was now isolated; attempts by Frederick to divide his opponents by supporting Frederick Augustus of Saxony for Emperor were unsuccessful, while neither Britain or Russia was willing to mediate for him with Austria.

Bavaria&#x27;s exit allowed France to focus on the Low Countries, which Saxe persuaded Louis XV provided the best opportunity of defeating Britain, whose financial backing was crucial to the Pragmatic Alliance. He proposed to attack Tournai, a vital link in the trading network for Northern Europe, and strongest of the Dutch Barrier Forts, this forcing the Allies to fight on ground of his own choosing. On 11 May, he won a hard-fought victory at Fontenoy, a success that established French dominance in the Netherlands, and caused bitter disputes between the British and Dutch.

On 4 June, Frederick won a major victory at Hohenfriedberg, but despite this, Austria and Saxony continued the war. Prussian requests for French support were ignored; Louis had been warned by his ministers state finances were increasingly strained, making it important to focus their efforts. One area was the Netherlands, particularly after British troops were recalled to deal with the Jacobite rising of 1745. The other was Italy, where a Franco-Spanish army under Maillebois and Infante Philip defeated the Sardinians at Bassignano on 27 September, then captured Alessandria, Valenza and Casale Monferrato.
As a result, France made no effort to block the election of Duke Francis, who was proclaimed Emperor Francis I on 13 September. Bolstered by this significant political victory, Maria Theresa continued her attempts to regain Silesia, only to be defeated once again at the Battle of Soor on 30 September. On 15 December, the Prussians forced Saxony out of the war with victory in the Battle of Kesselsdorf, leading to the Treaty of Dresden on 25th. Austria accepted Frederick&#x27;s ownership of Silesia, while Saxony paid him an indemnity of one million crowns; in return, Prussia accepted the Pragmatic Sanction, acknowledged Francis as Emperor, and evacuated Saxony.

After 1745, Germany ceased to be an active military theatre; although Frederick knew Maria Theresa still intended to regain Silesia, both sides needed a period of peace in order to re-organise. French objectives were less clear; for centuries, the central plank of its foreign policy was weakening the Habsburgs, but it began the war due to concern at British commercial growth post-1713. Since the war in Northern Italy was largely fought to support Spanish aims, this left the Netherlands as the only remaining theatre where France could achieve strategic victory.

Another significant development was the start of the realignment of alliances that became the Diplomatic Revolution in 1756. Under the August &#x27;Convention of Hanover&#x27;, Frederick and George II mutually guaranteed the borders of Hanover and Prussia to each other, and British diplomats tried to persuade Austria to end the Second Silesian War. Franco-Prussian relationships were marked by mutual distrust, while Maria Theresa resented British attempts to persuade her to accept the loss of Silesia.

==Italian Campaigns, 1741–1747==

In central Italy an army of Spaniards and Neapolitans was collected for the purpose of conquering the Duchy of Milan. In 1741, the allied army of 40,000 Spaniards and Neapolitans under the command of the Duke of Montemar had advanced towards Modena, Francesco III d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena had allied himself with them, but the vigilant Austrian commander, Count Otto Ferdinand von Traun had out-marched them, captured Modena and forced the Duke to make a separate peace.

The aggressiveness of the Spanish in Italy forced Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and King Charles Emmanuel of Sardinia into negotiations in early 1742. These negotiations were held at Turin. Maria Theresa sent her envoy Count Schulenburg and King Charles Emmanuel sent the Marquis d&#x27;Ormea. On 1 February 1742, Schulenburg and Ormea signed the Convention of Turin which resolved (or postponed resolution) many differences and formed an alliance between the two countries. In 1742, field marshal Count Traun held his own with ease against the Spanish and Neapolitans. On 19 August 1742, Naples was forced by the arrival of a British naval squadron in Naples&#x27; own harbour, to withdraw her 10,000 troops from the Montemar force to provide for home defence. The Spanish force under Montemar was now too weak to advance in the Po Valley and a second Spanish army was sent to Italy via France. Sardinia had allied herself with Austria in the Convention of Turin and at the same time neither state was at war with France and this led to curious complications, combats being fought in the Isère valley between the troops of Sardinia and of Spain, in which the French took no part. At the end of 1742, the Duke of Montemar was replaced as head of the Spanish forces in Italy by Count Gages.

In 1743, the Spanish on the Panaro had achieved a victory over Traun at Campo Santo on 8 February 1743. However, the next six months were wasted in inaction and Johann Georg Christian, Prince of Lobkowicz, joining Traun with reinforcements from Austria, drove back the Spanish to Rimini. Observing from Venice, Rousseau hailed the Spanish retreat as &quot;the finest military manoeuvre of the whole century&quot;. The Spanish-Savoyard War in the Alps continued without much result, the only incident of note being the first Battle of Casteldelfino (7–10 October 1743), when an initial French offensive was defeated.

In 1744, the Italian war became serious. Prior to the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) Spain and Austria had been ruled by branches of the same (Habsburg) royal house. Consequently, the foreign policies of Austria and Spain in regards to Italy had a symmetry of interests and these interests were usually opposed to the interests of Bourbon controlled France. However, since the Treaty of Utrecht and the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, the childless last Habsburg monarch (Charles II) had been replaced by the Bourbon grandson of the French king Louis XIV Philip of Anjou, who became Philip V in Spain. Spain&#x27;s dominance of Italy and Italian territories subsequently passed to Austria. Now the symmetry of foreign policy interests in regards to Italy existed between Bourbon France and Bourbon Spain with Habsburg Austria usually in opposition. King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia had followed the long-established foreign policy of Savoy of opposing Spanish interference in northern Italy. Now in 1744, Savoy was faced with a grandiose military plan of the combined Spanish and French armies (called the Gallispan army) for conquest of northern Italy.

However, in implementing this plan, the Gallispan generals at the front were hampered by the orders of their respective governments. For example, the commander of the French army in the field, the Prince of Conti, could not get along with, or even reason with, the Marquis de La Mina, the Supreme commander of all Spanish forces. The Prince of Conti felt that the Marquis &quot;deferred blindly to all orders coming from Spain&quot; without any consideration of the realities on the ground. In preparation for the military campaign the Gallispan forces sought to cross the Alps in June 1744 and regroup the army in Dauphiné uniting there with the army on the lower Po.
The support of Genoa allowed a road into central Italy. While the Prince of Conti stayed in the north, Count Gages followed this road to the south. But then the Austrian commander, Prince Lobkowitz took the offensive and drove the Spanish army of the Count de Gages further southward towards the Neapolitan frontier near the small town of Velletri. From June through August 1744, Velletri became the scene of extensive military maneuvering between the French-Spanish army under the command of the Count Gages and the Austrian forces under the command of Prince Lobkowitz The King of Naples (the future Charles III of Spain) was increasingly worried about the Austrian army operating so close to his borders and decided to assist the Spaniards. Together a combined army of French, Spanish and Neapolitans surprised the Austrian army on the night of 16–17 June 1744. The Austrians were routed from three important hills around the town of Velletri during the attack. This battle is sometimes called the &quot;Battle of Nemi&quot; after the small town of Nemi located nearby. Because of this surprise attack, the combined army was able to take possession of the town of Velletri. Thus, the surprise attack has also been called the &quot;first Battle of Velletri&quot;.

In early August 1744, the King of Naples paid a visit in person to the newly captured town of Velletri. Hearing about the presence of the King, the Austrians developed a plan for a daring raid on Velletri. During the predawn hours of 11 August 1744, about 6,000 Austrians under the direct command of Count Browne staged a surprise raid on the town of Velletri. They were attempting to abduct the King of Naples during his stay in the town. However, after occupying Velletri and searching the entire town, the Austrians found no hint of the King of Naples. The King had become aware of what was happening and had fled through a window of the palace where he was staying and rode off half-dressed on horseback out of the town. This was the second Battle of Velletri. The failure of the raid on Velletri meant that the Austrian march toward Naples was over. The defeated Austrians were ordered north where they could be used in the Piedmont of northern Italy to assist the King of Sardinia against the Prince of Conti. Count de Gages followed the Austrians north with a weak force. Meanwhile, the King of Naples returned home.
The war in the Alps and the Apennines had already been keenly contested before the Prince of Conti and the Gallispan army had come down out of the Alps. First, the Fort de Villefranche and Fort du mont Alban near Nice had been stormed by Conti on 20 April 1744. After coming down out of the Alps, Prince Conti began his advance into Piedmont on 5 July 1744. On 19 July 1744, the Gallispan army engaged the Sardinian army in some desperate fighting at Peyre-Longue on 18 July 1744. As a result of the battle, the Gallispan army took control of Casteldelfino in the second Battle of Casteldelfino. Conti then moved on to Demonte where on the night of 8–9 August 1744, (a mere 36 hours before the Spanish army in south of Italy fought the second Battle of Velletri, [as noted above]) the Gallispan army took the fortress of Demonte from the Sardinians in the Battle of Demonte. The King of Sardinia was defeated yet again by Conti in a great Battle at Madonna dell&#x27;Olmo on 30 September 1744 near Coni (Cuneo). Conti did not, however, succeed in taking the huge fortress at Coni and had to retire into Dauphiné for his winter quarters. Thus, the Gallispan army never did combine with the Spanish army under Count of Gages in the south and now the Austro-Sardinian army lay between them.

The campaign in Italy in 1745 was also no mere war of posts. The Convention of Turin of February 1742 (described above), which established a provisional relationship between Austria and Sardinia had caused some consternation in the Republic of Genoa. However, when this provisional relationship was given a more durable and reliable character in the signing of the Treaty of Worms (1743) signed on 13 September 1743, the government of Genoa became fearful. This fear of diplomatic isolation had caused the Genoese Republic to abandon its neutrality in the war and join the Bourbon cause. Consequently, the Genoese Republic signed a secret treaty with the Bourbon allies of France, Spain and Naples. On 26 June 1745, Genoa declared war on Sardinia.
Empress Maria Theresa was frustrated with the failure of Lobkowitz to stop the advance of Gages. Accordingly, Lobkowitz was replaced with Count Schulenburg. A change in the command of the Austrians, encouraged the Bourbon allies to strike first in the spring of 1745. Accordingly, Count de Gages moved from Modena towards Lucca, the Gallispan army in the Alps under the new command of Marshal Maillebois (Prince Conti and Marshal Maillebois had exchanged commands over the winter of 1744–1745) advanced through the Italian Riviera to the Tanaro. In the middle of July 1745, the two armies were at last concentrated between the Scrivia and the Tanaro. Together Count de Gages&#x27;s army and the Gallispan army composed an unusually large number of 80,000 men. A swift march on Piacenza drew the Austrian commander thither and in his absence the allies fell upon and completely defeated the Sardinians at Bassignano on 27 September 1745, a victory which was quickly followed by the capture of Alessandria, Valenza and Casale Monferrato. Jomini calls the concentration of forces which effected the victory &quot;&quot;.
The complicated politics of Italy, however, are reflected in the fact that Count Maillebois was ultimately unable to turn his victory to account. Indeed, early in 1746, Austrian troops, freed by the Austrian peace with Frederick II of Prussia, passed through the Tyrol into Italy, capturing Genoa after a siege. The Gallispan winter quarters at Asti, Italy, were brusquely attacked and a French garrison of 6,000 men at Asti was forced to capitulate. At the same time, Maximilian Ulysses Browne with an Austrian corps struck at the allies on the Lower Po, and cut off their communication with the main body of the Gallispan army in Piedmont. A series of minor actions thus completely destroyed the great concentration of Gallispan troops and the Austrians entered Milan after the Spanish abandoned the city on 19 March 1746. With those actions the Austrians took possession of much of northern Italy. The allies separated, Maillebois covering Liguria, the Spaniards marching against Browne. The latter was promptly and heavily reinforced and all that the Spaniards could do was to entrench themselves at Piacenza, Philip, the Spanish Infante as supreme commander calling up Maillebois to his aid. The French, skilfully conducted and marching rapidly, joined forces once more, but their situation was critical, for only two marches behind them the army of the King of Sardinia was in pursuit, and before them lay the principal army of the Austrians. The pitched Battle of Piacenza on 16 June 1746 was hard-fought but ended in an Austrian victory, with the Spanish army heavily mauled. That the army escaped at all was in the highest degree creditable to Maillebois and to his son and chief of staff. Under their leadership the Gallispan army eluded both the Austrians and the Sardinians and defeated an Austrian corps in the Battle of Rottofreddo on 12 August 1746. Then the Austrian army made good its retreat back to Genoa.

Although the Austrian army was a mere shadow of its former self, when they returned to Genoa, the Austrians were soon in control of northern Italy. The Austrians occupied the Republic of Genoa on 6 September 1746. But they met with no success in their forays towards the Alps. Soon Genoa and drove out the Austrians on 5–11 December 1746. As an Allied invasion of Provence stalled, and the French, now commanded by Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet, duc de Belle-Isle, took the offensive (1747). Genoa held out against a second Austrian siege. As usual the plan of campaign had been referred to Paris and Madrid. A picked corps of the French army under the Chevalier de Belle-Isle (the younger brother of Marshal Belle-Isle) was ordered to storm the fortified pass of Exilles on 10 July 1747. However, the defending army of the Worms allies (Austria and Savoy) handed the French army a crushing defeat at this battle, which became known as the (Colle dell&#x27;Assietta). At this battle, the chevalier, and with him much of the elite of the French nobility, were killed on the barricades. Desultory campaigns continued between the Worms allies and the French until the conclusion of peace at Aix-la-Chapelle.

==The Low Countries, 1745–1748==
The Dutch, British and Austrians withdrew from Fontenoy in good order but Tournai fell to French forces and through a swift advance, Ghent, Oudenarde, Bruges, and Dendermonde soon followed. By the end of July, the French stood on the threshold of Dutch Flanders, the south-western corner of the Dutch Republic. The French-backed Jacobite rising of August, 1745 forced the British to transfer troops from Flanders to deal with it. This prompted the French to seize the strategic ports of Ostend and Nieuwpoort, threatening Britain&#x27;s links to mainland Europe.
During 1746, the French continued their advance into the Austrian Netherlands, taking Antwerp and then clearing Dutch and Austrian forces from the area between Brussels and the Meuse. After defeating the Jacobite Rebellion at Culloden in April, the British launched a diversionary raid on Lorient in an unsuccessful attempt to divert French forces, while the new Austrian commander, Prince Charles of Lorraine, was defeated by Saxe at the Battle of Rocoux in October.

The Dutch Republic itself was now in danger. In April 1747, the French began reducing the Barrier Fortresses along the border with the Austrian Netherlands and invaded Dutch Flanders, which they swiftly captured. A general anger and panic broke out under the Dutch population, who still remembered the French invasion of 1672, and they demanded that William IV should be appointed stadtholder. The regents of Zeeland and Holland, fearing violence against them, soon appointed William stadtholder. The remaining provinces followed and by 10 May the Second Stadtholderless Period had ended. William was also appointed head of all the Dutch armed forces. The strategic situation, however, failed to change and at Lauffeld on 2 July 1747, Saxe won another victory over a British and Dutch army under the Prince of Waldeck and Cumberland; the French then besieged Maastricht and Bergen op Zoom, which fell in September. Although the Dutch States Navy was in the poorest condition it had ever been in, its positioning in the estuaries and rivers of Zeeland and Holland, however, prevented French incursions into those provinces.

The French advance lent greater urgency to ongoing peace talks at the Congress of Breda, which took place to the sound of French artillery firing on Maastricht. Following their 1746 alliance with Austria, an army of 30,000 Russians marched from Livonia to the Rhine, but arrived too late to be of use. Maastricht surrendered on 7 May and on 18 October 1748, the war ended with the signing of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle.

==The Peace of 1748==
Negotiations between Britain and France had been taking place at Breda since June 1746; the terms they agreed were then imposed on the other parties at Aix-la-Chapelle. Despite their victories in Flanders, French Finance Minister Machault repeatedly warned of the impending collapse of their financial system. The British naval blockade led to the collapse of French customs receipts and caused severe food shortages, especially among the poor; after Cape Finisterre in October, the French Navy could no longer protect their colonies or trade routes.This was followed in November by a convention between Britain and Russia; in February 1748, a Russian corps of 37,000 arrived in the Rhineland. Although the Dutch city of Maastricht surrendered to French forces in May 1748, ending the war was increasingly urgent. Louis XV therefore agreed to return the Austrian Netherlands, whose acquisition had cost so much. Few of his countrymen understood this decision; combined with the lack of tangible benefits for helping Prussia, it led to the phrase &quot;as stupid as the Peace&quot;.

A commission to negotiate competing territorial claims in North America was set up, but made very little progress. Britain regained Madras, in return for restoring Louisbourg, in Nova Scotia, much to the fury of British colonists. Neither of the two main protagonists appeared to have gained much for their investment and both viewed the Treaty as an armistice, not a peace.
In Austria, reactions were mixed; Maria Theresa was determined to regain Silesia and resented British support for Prussia&#x27;s occupation. On the other hand, the Treaty confirmed her right to the Monarchy, while the Habsburgs had survived a potentially disastrous crisis, regained the Austrian Netherlands without fighting and made only minor concessions in Italy. Administrative and financial reforms made it stronger in 1750 than 1740, while its strategic position was strengthened through installing Habsburg allies as rulers of key territories in Northwest Germany, the Rhineland and Northern Italy.

Of the other combatants, Spain retained its predominance in Spanish America and made minor gains in Northern Italy, gaining the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza for Infante Philip. With French support, Prussia doubled in size with the acquisition of Silesia but twice made peace without informing their ally; Louis XV already disliked Frederick and now viewed him as untrustworthy. In the Dutch Republic the signing of the peace terms, the elevation of the Prince of Orange and the birth of his son caused great joy, but dissatisfaction towards the ruling regime remained. William IV had changed little, did not reckon with his political opponents and, like them, was accused of French sympathies. Many began to think that improvements would not be obtained unless they were violently demanded; and so riots arose. The war confirmed the decline of the Dutch Republic, and the dismantlement of the Barrier fortresses marked the end of its period as a great power; combined with a sense they received little value for the subsidies paid to Maria Theresa, Britain moved to align itself with Prussia, rather than Austria, in order to protect Hanover from French aggression.

These factors led to the realignment known as the 1756 Diplomatic Revolution and the 1756 to 1763 Seven Years&#x27; War, which was even grander in scale than its predecessor.

==North America==
The war was also conducted in North America and India. In North America the conflict was known in the British colonies as King George&#x27;s War, and did not begin until after formal war declarations of France and Britain reached the colonies in May 1744. The frontiers between New France and the British colonies of New England, New York, and Nova Scotia were the site of frequent small scale raids, primarily by French colonial troops and their Indian allies against British targets, although several attempts were made by British colonists to organise expeditions against New France. The most significant incident was the capture of the French Fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island (Île Royale) by an expedition (29 April16 June 1745) of colonial militia organised by Massachusetts Governor William Shirley, commanded by William Pepperrell of Maine (then part of Massachusetts), and assisted by a Royal Navy fleet. A French expedition to recover Louisbourg in 1746 failed due to bad weather, disease, and the death of its commander. Louisbourg was returned to France in exchange for Madras, generating much anger among the British colonists, who felt they had eliminated a nest of privateers with its capture.

==India==

The war marked the beginning of a powerful struggle between Britain and France in India and of European military ascendancy and political intervention in the subcontinent. Major hostilities began with the arrival of a naval squadron under Mahé de la Bourdonnais, carrying troops from France. In September 1746 Bourdonnais landed his troops near Madras and laid siege to the port. Although it was the main British settlement in the Carnatic, Madras was weakly fortified and had only a small garrison, reflecting the thoroughly commercial nature of the European presence in India hitherto. On 10 September, only six days after the arrival of the French force, Madras surrendered. The terms of the surrender agreed by Bourdonnais provided for the settlement to be ransomed back for a cash payment by the British East India Company. However, this concession was opposed by Dupleix, the governor general of the Indian possessions of the Compagnie des Indes. When Bourdonnais was forced to leave India in October after the devastation of his squadron by a cyclone Dupleix reneged on the agreement. The Nawab of the Carnatic Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan intervened in support of the British and advanced to retake Madras, but despite vast superiority in numbers his army was easily and bloodily crushed by the French, in the first demonstration of the gap in quality that had opened up between European and Indian armies.

The French now turned to the remaining British settlement in the Carnatic, Fort St. David at Cuddalore, which was dangerously close to the main French settlement of Pondichéry. The first French force sent against Cuddalore was surprised and defeated nearby by the forces of the Nawab and the British garrison in December 1746. Early in 1747 a second expedition laid siege to Fort St David but withdrew on the arrival of a British naval squadron in March. A final attempt in June 1748 avoided the fort and attacked the weakly fortified town of Cuddalore itself, but was routed by the British garrison.

With the arrival of a naval squadron under Admiral Edward Boscawen, carrying troops and artillery, the British went on the offensive, laying siege to Pondichéry. They enjoyed a considerable superiority in numbers over the defenders, but the settlement had been heavily fortified by Dupleix and after two months the siege was abandoned.

The peace settlement brought the return of Madras to the British company, exchanged for Louisbourg in Canada. However, the conflict between the two companies continued by proxy during the interval before the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War, with British and French forces fighting on behalf of rival claimants to the thrones of Hyderabad and the Carnatic.

==Naval operations==

The naval operations of this war were entangled with the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, which broke out in 1739 in consequence of the long disputes between Britain and Spain over their conflicting claims in America. The war was remarkable for the prominence of privateering on both sides. It was carried on by the Spaniards in the West Indies with great success, and actively at home. The French were no less active in all seas. Mahé de la Bourdonnais&#x27;s attack on Madras partook largely of the nature of a privateering venture. The British retaliated with vigour. The total number of captures by French and Spanish corsairs was in all probability larger than the list of British—as the French wit Voltaire drolly put it upon hearing his government&#x27;s boast, namely, that more British merchants were taken because there were many more British merchant ships to take; but partly also because the British government had not yet begun to enforce the use of convoy so strictly as it did in later times.

===West Indies===
War on Spain was declared by Great Britain on 23 October 1739, which has become known as the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear. A plan was laid for combined operations against the Spanish colonies from east and west. One force, military and naval, was to assault them from the West Indies under Admiral Edward Vernon. Another, to be commanded by Commodore George Anson, afterwards Lord Anson, was to round Cape Horn and to fall upon the Pacific coast of Latin America. Delays, bad preparations, dockyard corruption, and the squabbles of the naval and military officers concerned caused the failure of a hopeful scheme. On 21 November 1739, Admiral Vernon did, however, succeed in capturing the ill-defended Spanish harbour of Porto Bello in present-day Panama. When Vernon had been joined by Sir Chaloner Ogle with massive naval reinforcements and a strong body of troops, an attack was made on Cartagena de Indias in what is now Colombia (9 March24 April 1741). The delay had given the Spanish under Sebastián de Eslava and Blas de Lezo time to prepare. After two months of skilful defence by the Spanish, the British attack finally succumbed to a massive outbreak of disease and withdrew having suffered a dreadful loss of lives and ships.

The war in the West Indies, after two other unsuccessful attacks had been made on Spanish territory, died down and did not revive until 1748. The expedition under Anson sailed late, was very ill-provided, and less strong than had been intended. It consisted of six ships and left Britain on 18 September 1740. Anson returned alone with his flagship the &quot;Centurion&quot; on 15 June 1744. The other vessels had either failed to round the Horn or had been lost. But Anson had harried the coast of Chile and Peru and had captured a Spanish galleon of immense value near the Philippines, completing a circumnavigation of the world. His cruise was a great feat of resolution and endurance.

After the failure of the British invasions and a Spanish counter invasion of Georgia in 1742, belligerent naval actions in the Caribbean were left to the privateers of both sides. Fearing great financial and economic losses should a treasure fleet be captured, the Spanish reduced the risk by increasing the number of convoys, thereby reducing their value. They also increased the number of ports they visited and reduced the predictability of their voyages.

In 1744, a British force of 300 men accompanied by two privateers from Saint Kitts successfully captured the French half of neighbouring Saint Martin, occupying it until the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In late May 1745 two French royal frigates of 36 and 30 guns respectively under Commodore La Touché, plus three privateers in retaliation sailed from Martinique to invade and capture the British colony of Anguilla but were repelled with heavy loss in the Battle of Anguilla.

The last year of the war saw two significant actions in the Caribbean. A second British assault on Santiago de Cuba which also ended in failure and a naval action which arose from an accidental encounter between two convoys. The action unfolded in a confused way with each side at once anxious to cover its own trade and to intercept that of the other. Capture was rendered particularly desirable for the British by the fact that the Spanish homeward-bound fleet would be laden with bullion from the American mines. The advantage lay with the British when one Spanish warship ran aground and another was captured but the British commander failed to capitalise and the Spanish fleet took shelter in Havana.

===Mediterranean===
While Anson was pursuing his voyage round the world, Spain was mainly intent on the Italian policy of the king. A squadron was fitted out at Cádiz to convey troops to Italy. It was watched by the British admiral Nicholas Haddock. When the blockading squadron was forced off by want of provisions, the Spanish admiral Don Juan José Navarro put to sea. He was followed, but when the British force came in sight of him Navarro had been joined by a French squadron under Claude-Élisée de Court de La Bruyère (December 1741). The French admiral told Haddock that he would support the Spaniards if they were attacked and Haddock retired. France and Great Britain were not yet openly at war, but both were engaged in the struggle in Germany—Great Britain as the ally of the Queen of Hungary, Maria Theresa; France as the supporter of the Bavarian claimant of the empire. Navarro and de Court went on to Toulon, where they remained until February 1744. A British fleet watched them, under the command of Admiral Richard Lestock, until Sir Thomas Mathews was sent out as commander-in-chief and as Minister to the Court of Turin.

Sporadic manifestations of hostility between the French and British took place in different seas, but avowed war did not begin until the French government issued its declaration of 30 March, to which Great Britain replied on 31 March. This formality had been preceded by French preparations for the invasion of England, and by the Battle of Toulon between the British and a Franco-Spanish fleet. On 11 February, a most confused battle was fought, in which the van and centre of the British fleet was engaged with the Spanish rear and centre of the allies. Lestock, who was on the worst possible terms with his superior, took no part in the action. Mathews fought with spirit but in a disorderly way, breaking the formation of his fleet, and showing no power of direction, while Navarro&#x27;s smaller fleet retained cohesion and fought off the energetic but confused attacks of its larger enemy until the arrival of the French fleet forced the heavily damaged British fleet to withdraw. The Spanish fleet then sailed to Italy where it delivered a fresh army and supplies that had a decisive impact upon the war. The mismanagement of the British fleet in the battle, by arousing deep anger among the people, led to a drastic reform of the British navy.

===Northern waters===
The French scheme to invade Britain was arranged in combination with the Jacobite leaders, and soldiers were to be transported from Dunkirk. In February 1744, a French fleet of twenty sail of the line entered the English Channel under Jacques Aymar, comte de Roquefeuil, before the British force under Admiral John Norris was ready to oppose him. But the French force was ill-equipped, the admiral was nervous, his mind dwelt on all the misfortunes which might possibly happen, and the weather was bad. De Roquefeuil came up almost as far as The Downs, where he learnt that Sir John Norris was at hand with twenty-five sail of the line, and thereupon precipitately retreated. The military expedition prepared at Dunkirk to cross under cover of De Roquefeuil&#x27;s fleet naturally did not start. The utter weakness of the French at sea, due to long neglect of the fleet and the bankrupt state of the treasury, was shown during the Jacobite rising of 1745, when France made no attempt to profit by the distress of the British government.

The Dutch, having by this time joined Great Britain, made a serious addition to the naval power opposed to France, though the Dutch Republic was compelled by the necessity for maintaining an army in Flanders to play a very subordinate part at sea. Not being stimulated by formidable attack, and having immediate interests both at home and in Germany, the British government was slow to make use of its latest naval strength. Spain, which could do nothing of an offensive character, was almost neglected. During 1745 the New England expedition which took Louisburg (30 April16 June) was covered by a British naval force, but little else was accomplished by the naval efforts of any of the belligerents.

In 1746, a British combined naval and military expedition to the coast of France—the first of a long series of similar ventures which in the end were derided as &quot;breaking windows with guineas&quot;—was carried out during August and October. The aim was the capture of the French East India Company&#x27;s dockyard at Lorient, but it was not attained.

From 1747 until the close of the war in October 1748, the naval policy of the British government, without reaching a high level, was more energetic and coherent. A closer watch was kept on the French coast, and effectual means were taken to intercept communication between France and her American possessions. In the spring information was obtained that an important convoy for the East and West Indies was to sail from Lorient. The convoy was intercepted by Anson on 3 May, and in the First Battle of Cape Finisterre, British admiral George Anson&#x27;s fourteen ships of the line wiped out the French escort of six ships of the line and three armed Indiamen, although in the meantime the merchant ships escaped.

On 14 October, another French convoy, protected by a strong squadron, was intercepted by a well-appointed and well-directed squadron of superior numbers—the squadrons were respectively eight French and fourteen British—in the Bay of Biscay. In the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre which followed, the French admiral, Henri-François des Herbiers, Marquis de l&#x27;Estenduère, succeeded in covering the escape of most of the merchant ships, but Hawke&#x27;s British squadron took six of his warships. Most of the merchantmen were later intercepted and captured in the West Indies. This disaster convinced the French government of its helplessness at sea, and it made no further effort.

===Indian Ocean===

In the East Indies, attacks on French commerce by a British squadron under Curtis Barnett in 1745 led to the despatch of a French squadron commanded by Mahé de la Bourdonnais. After an inconclusive clash off Negapatnam in July 1746, Edward Peyton, Barnett&#x27;s successor, withdrew to Bengal, leaving Bourdonnais unopposed on the Coromandel Coast. He landed troops near Madras and besieged the port by land and sea, forcing it to surrender on 10 September 1746. In October the French squadron was devastated by a cyclone, losing four ships of the line and suffering heavy damage to four more, and the surviving ships withdrew. French land forces went on to make several attacks on the British settlement at Cuddalore, but the eventual replacement of the negligent Peyton by Thomas Griffin resulted in a return to British naval supremacy which put the French on the defensive. Despite the appearance of another French squadron, the arrival of large-scale British reinforcements under Edward Boscawen (who considered but did not make an attack on Île de France on the way) gave the British overwhelming dominance on land and sea, but the ensuing siege of Pondichéry organised by Boscawen was unsuccessful.

===Military methods and technologies===

European warfare in the early modern period was characterised by the widespread adoption of firearms in combination with more traditional bladed weapons. Eighteenth-century European armies were built around units of massed infantry armed with smoothbore flintlock muskets and bayonets. Cavalrymen were equipped with sabres and pistols or carbines; light cavalry were used principally for reconnaissance, screening and tactical communications, while heavy cavalry were used as tactical reserves and deployed for shock attacks. Smoothbore artillery provided fire support and played the leading role in siege warfare. Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key fortifications positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict. Decisive field battles were relatively rare, though they played a larger part in Frederick&#x27;s theory of warfare than was typical among his contemporary rivals.

The War of the Austrian Succession, like most European wars of the eighteenth century, was fought as a so-called cabinet war in which disciplined regular armies were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign&#x27;s interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century. Military logistics was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised magazines and distributed by baggage trains that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids. Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established winter quarters in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring.

<text>The Sabra and Shatila massacre was the 16–18 September 1982 killing of between 1,300 and 3,500 civiliansmostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiasin the city of Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War. It was perpetrated by the Lebanese Forces, one of the main Christian militias in Lebanon, and supported by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that had surrounded Beirut&#x27;s Sabra neighbourhood and the adjacent Shatila refugee camp.

In June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon with the intention of rooting out the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). By 30 August 1982, under the supervision of the Multinational Force, the PLO withdrew from Lebanon following weeks of battles in West Beirut and shortly before the massacre took place. Various forces—Israeli, Lebanese Forces and possibly also the South Lebanon Army (SLA)—were in the vicinity of Sabra and Shatila at the time of the slaughter, taking advantage of the fact that the Multinational Force had removed barracks and mines that had encircled Beirut&#x27;s predominantly Muslim neighborhoods and kept the Israelis at bay during the siege of Beirut. The Israeli advance over West Beirut in the wake of the PLO withdrawal, which enabled the Lebanese Forces raid, was in violation of the ceasefire agreement between the various forces.

The killings are widely believed to have taken place under the command of Lebanese politician Elie Hobeika, whose family and fiancée had been murdered by Palestinian militants and left-wing Lebanese militias during the Damour massacre in 1976, itself a response to the Karantina massacre of Palestinians and Lebanese Shias at the hands of Christian militias. In total, between 300 and 400 militiamen were involved in the massacre, including some from the South Lebanon Army. As the massacre unfolded, the IDF received reports of atrocities being committed, but did not take any action to stop it. Instead, Israeli troops were stationed at the exits of the area to prevent the camp&#x27;s residents from leaving and, at the request of the Lebanese Forces, shot flares to illuminate Sabra and Shatila through the night during the massacre.

In February 1983, an independent commission chaired by Irish diplomat Seán MacBride, assistant to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, concluded that the IDF, as the then occupying power over Sabra and Shatila, bore responsibility for the militia&#x27;s massacre. The commission also stated that the massacre was a form of genocide. And in February 1983, the Israeli Kahan Commission found that Israeli military personnel had failed to take serious steps to stop the killings despite being aware of the militia&#x27;s actions, and deemed that the IDF was indirectly responsible for the events, and forced erstwhile Israeli defense minister Ariel Sharon to resign from his position &quot;for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge&quot; during the massacre.

==Background==
=== Lebanese Civil War and Israeli-PLO skirmishes ===
From 1975 to 1990, groups in competing alliances with neighboring countries fought against each other in the Lebanese Civil War. Infighting and massacres between these groups claimed several thousand victims. Examples: the Syrian-backed Karantina massacre (January 1976) by the Kataeb and its allies against Kurds, Syrians and Palestinians in the predominantly Muslim slum district of Beirut; Damour (January 1976) by the PLO against Christian Maronites, including the family and fiancée of the Lebanese Forces intelligence chief Elie Hobeika; and Tel al-Zaatar (August 1976) by Phalangists and their allies against Palestinian refugees living in a camp administered by UNRWA. The total death toll in Lebanon for the whole civil war period was around 150,000 victims.

As the civil war unfolded, Israel and the PLO had been exchanging attacks since the early 1970s until early 1980s.

The casus belli cited by the Israeli side to declare war, however, was an assassination attempt, on 3 June 1982, made upon Israeli Ambassador to Britain Shlomo Argov. The attempt was the work of the Iraq-based Abu Nidal, possibly with Syrian or Iraqi involvement. Historians and observers such as David Hirst and Benny Morris have commented that the PLO could not have been involved in the assault, or even approved of it, as Abu Nidal&#x27;s group was a bitter rival to Arafat&#x27;s PLO and even murdered some of its members. The PLO issued a condemnation of the attempted assassination of the Israeli ambassador. Nonetheless, Israel used the event as a justification to break the ceasefire with the PLO, and as a casus belli for a full-scale invasion of Lebanon.

=== Post-war assessment ===
After the war, Israel presented its actions as a response to terrorism being carried out by the PLO from several fronts, including the border with Lebanon. However, these historians have argued that the PLO was respecting the ceasefire agreement then in force with Israel and keeping the border between the Jewish state and Lebanon more stable than it had been for over a decade. During that ceasefire, which lasted eight months, UNIFIL—the UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon—reported that the PLO had launched not a single act of provocation against Israel. The Israeli government tried out several justifications to ditch the ceasefire and attack the PLO, even eliciting accusations from the Israeli opposition that &quot;demagogy&quot; from the government threatened to pull Israel into war. Before the attempted assassination of the ambassador, all such justifications had been shot down by its ally, the United States, as an insufficient reason to launch a war against the PLO.

On 6 June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon moving northwards to surround the capital, Beirut. Following an extended siege of the city, the fighting was brought to an end with a U.S.-brokered agreement between the parties on 21 August 1982, which allowed for safe evacuation of the Palestinian fighters from the city under the supervision of Western nations and guaranteed the protection of refugees and the civilian residents of the refugee camps.

On 15 June 1982, 10 days after the start of the invasion, the Israeli Cabinet passed a proposal put forward by the Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, that the IDF should not enter West Beirut but this should be done by Lebanese Forces. Chief of Staff, Rafael Eitan, had already issued orders that the Lebanese predominantly Christian, right-wing militias should not take part in the fighting and the proposal was to counter public complaints that the IDF were suffering casualties whilst their allies were standing by. The subsequent Israeli inquiry estimated the strength of militias in West Beirut, excluding Palestinians, to be around 7,000. They estimated the Lebanese Forces to be 5,000 when fully mobilized of whom 2,000 were full-time.

On 23 August 1982, Bachir Gemayel, leader of the right-wing Lebanese Forces, was elected President of Lebanon by the National Assembly. Israel had relied on Gemayel and his forces as a counterbalance to the PLO, and as a result, ties between Israel and Maronite groups, from which hailed many of the supporters of the Lebanese Forces, had grown stronger.

By 1 September, the PLO fighters had been evacuated from Beirut under the supervision of Multinational Force. The evacuation was conditional on the continuation of the presence of the Multinational Force in Lebanon (MNF) to provide security for the community of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Two days later the Israeli Premier Menachem Begin met Gemayel in Nahariya and strongly urged him to sign a peace treaty with Israel. Begin also wanted the continuing presence of the SLA in southern Lebanon (Haddad supported peaceful relations with Israel) in order to control attacks and violence, and action from Gemayel to move on the PLO fighters which Israel believed remained a hidden threat in Lebanon. However, the Phalangists, who were previously united as reliable Israeli allies, were now split because of developing alliances with Syria, which remained militarily hostile to Israel. As such, Gemayel rejected signing a peace treaty with Israel and did not authorize operations to root out the remaining PLO militants.

On 11 September 1982, the international forces that were guaranteeing the safety of Palestinian refugees left Beirut. Then on 14 September, Gemayel was assassinated in a massive explosion which demolished his headquarters. Eventually, the culprit, Habib Tanious Shartouni, a Lebanese Christian, confessed to the crime. He turned out to be a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party and an agent of Syrian intelligence. Palestinian and Lebanese Muslim leaders denied any connection to him.

On the evening of 14 September, following the news that Bachir Gemayel had been assassinated, Prime Minister Begin, Defense Minister Sharon and Chief of Staff Eitan agreed that the Israeli army should invade West Beirut. The public reason given was to be that they were there to prevent chaos. In a separate conversation, at 20:30 that evening, Sharon and Eitan agreed that the IDF should not enter the Palestinian refugee camps but that the Phalange should be used. The only other member of the cabinet who was consulted was Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Shortly after 6.00 am 15 September, the Israeli army entered West Beirut, This Israeli action breached its agreement with the United States not to occupy West Beirut and was in violation of the ceasefire.

 writes that while the massacre was presented as a reaction to the assassination of Bachir, it represented the posthumous achievement of his &quot;radical solution&quot; to Palestinians in Lebanon, who he thought of as &quot;people too many&quot; in the region. Later, the Israeli army&#x27;s monthly journal &quot;Skira Hodechith&quot; wrote that the Lebanese Forces hoped to provoke &quot;the general exodus of the Palestinian population&quot; and aimed to create a new demographic balance in Lebanon favouring the Christians.

== Attack ==
=== Lead-up events ===
On the night of 14/15 September 1982 the IDF chief of staff Raphael Eitan flew to Beirut where he went straight to the Phalangists&#x27; headquarters and instructed their leadership to order a general mobilisation of their forces and prepare to take part in the forthcoming Israeli attack on West Beirut. He also ordered them to impose a general curfew on all areas under their control and appoint a liaison officer to be stationed at the IDF forward command post. He told them that the IDF would not enter the refugee camps but that this would be done by the Phalangist forces. The militia leaders responded that the mobilisation would take them 24 hours to organise.

On morning of Wednesday 15 September Israeli Defence Minister, Sharon, who had also travelled to Beirut, held a meeting with Eitan at the IDF&#x27;s forward command post, on the roof of a five-storey building 200 metres southwest of Shatila camp. Also in attendance were Sharon&#x27;s aide Avi Duda&#x27;i, the Director of Military Intelligence -Yehoshua Saguy, a senior Mossad officer, General Amir Drori, General Amos Yaron, an Intelligence officer, the Head of GSS—Avraham Shalom, the Deputy Chief of Staff—General Moshe Levi and other senior officers. It was agreed that the Phalange should go into the camps. According to the Kahan Commission report throughout Wednesday, R.P.G. and light-weapons fire from the Sabra and Shatila camps was directed at this forward command post, and continued to a lesser degree on Thursday and Friday (16–17 September). It also added that by Thursday morning, the fighting had ended and all was &#x27;calm and quiet&#x27;.

Following the assassination of Lebanese Christian President Bachir Gemayel, the Phalangists sought revenge. By noon on 15 September, Sabra and Shatila had been surrounded by the IDF, which set up checkpoints at the exits and entrances, and used several multi-story buildings as observation posts. Amongst them was the seven-story Kuwaiti embassy which, according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, had &quot;an unobstructed and panoramic view&quot; of Sabra and Shatila. Hours later, IDF tanks began shelling Sabra and Shatila.

The following morning, 16 September, the sixth IDF order relating to the attack on West Beirut was issued. It specified: &quot;The refugee camps are not to be entered. Searching and mopping up the camps will be done by the Phalangists/Lebanese Army&quot;.

According to Linda Malone of the Jerusalem Fund, Ariel Sharon and Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan met with Phalangist militia units and invited them to enter Sabra and Shatila, claiming that the PLO was responsible for Gemayel&#x27;s assassination. The meeting concluded at 15:00 on 16 September.

Shatila had previously been one of the PLO&#x27;s three main training camps for foreign fighters and the main training camp for European fighters. The Israelis maintained that 2,000 to 3,000 terrorists remained in the camps, but were unwilling to risk the lives of more of their soldiers after the Lebanese army repeatedly refused to &quot;clear them out.&quot; No evidence was offered for this claim. There were only a small number of forces sent into the camps and they suffered minimal casualties. Two Phalangists were wounded, one in the leg and another in the hand. Investigations after the massacre found few weapons in the camps. Thomas Friedman, who entered the camps on Saturday, mostly found groups of young men with their hands and feet bound, who had been then lined up and machine-gunned down gang-land style, not typical he thought of the kind of deaths the reported 2,000 terrorists in the camp would have put up with.

=== Massacre ===
An hour later, 1,500 militiamen assembled at Beirut International Airport, then occupied by Israel. Under the command of Elie Hobeika, they began moving towards the area in IDF-supplied jeeps, some bearing weapons provided by Israel, following Israeli guidance on how to enter it. The forces were mostly Phalangist, though there were some men from Saad Haddad&#x27;s &quot;Free Lebanon forces&quot;. According to Ariel Sharon and Elie Hobeika&#x27;s bodyguard, the Phalangists were given &quot;harsh and clear&quot; warnings about harming civilians. However, it was by then known that the Phalangists presented a special security risk for Palestinians. It was published in the edition of 1 September of &quot;Bamahane&quot;, the IDF newspaper, that a Phalangist told an Israeli official: &quot;[T]he question we are putting to ourselves is—how to begin, by raping or killing?&quot; A US envoy to the Middle East expressed horror after being told of Sharon&#x27;s plans to send the Phalangists inside the camps, and Israeli officials themselves acknowledged the situation could trigger &quot;relentless slaughter&quot;.

The first unit of 150 Phalangists entered Sabra and Shatila at sunset on Thursday, 16 September. They entered the homes of the camp residents and began shooting and raping them, often taking groups outside and lining them up for execution. During the night, the Israeli forces fired illuminating flares over the area. According to a Dutch nurse, the camp was as bright as &quot;a sports stadium during a football game&quot;.

At 19:30, the Israeli Cabinet convened and was informed that the Phalangist commanders had been informed that their men must participate in the operation and fight, and enter the extremity of Sabra, while the IDF would guarantee the success of their operation though not participate in it. The Phalangists were to go in there &quot;with their own methods&quot;. After Gemayel&#x27;s assassination there were two possibilities, either the Phalange would collapse or they would undertake revenge, having killed Druze for that reason earlier that day. With regard to this second possibility, it was noted, &#x27;it will be an eruption the likes of which has never been seen; I can already see in their eyes what they are waiting for.&#x27; &#x27;Revenge&#x27; was what Bachir Gemayel&#x27;s brother had called for at the funeral earlier. Levy commented: &#x27;the Phalangists are already entering a certain neighborhood—and I know what the meaning of revenge is for them, what kind of slaughter. Then no one will believe we went in to create order there, and we will bear the blame. Therefore, I think that we are liable here to get into a situation in which we will be blamed, and our explanations will not stand up ...&quot; The press release that followed reads:

In the wake of the assassination of the President-elect Bashir Jemayel, the I.D.F. has seized positions in West Beirut in order to forestall the danger of violence, bloodshed and chaos, as some 2,000 terrorists, equipped with modern and heavy weapons, have remained in Beirut, in flagrant violation of the evacuation agreement.

An Israeli intelligence officer present in the forward post, wishing to obtain information about the Phalangists&#x27; activities, ordered two distinct actions to find out what was happening. The first failed to turn up anything. The second resulted in a report at 20:00 from the roof, stated that the Phalangists&#x27; liaison officer had heard from an operative inside the camp that he held 45 people and asked what he should do with him. The liaison officer told him to more or less &quot;Do the will of God.&quot; The Intelligence Officer received this report at approximately 20:00 from the person on the roof who heard the conversation. He did not pass on the report.

At roughly the same time or a little earlier at 19:00, Lieutenant Elul testified that he had overheard a radio conversation between one of the militia men in the camp and his commander Hobeika in which the former asking what he was to do with 50 women and children who had been taken prisoner. Hobeika&#x27;s reply was: &quot;This is the last time you&#x27;re going to ask me a question like that; you know exactly what to do.&quot; Other Phalangists on the roof started laughing. Amongst the Israelis there was Brigadier General Yaron, Divisional Commander, who asked Lieutenant Elul, his Chef de Bureau, what the laughter was about; Elul translated what Hobeika had said. Yaron then had a five-minute conversation, in English, with Hobeika. What was said is unknown.

The Kahan Commission determined that the evidence pointed to &#x27;two different and separate reports&#x27;, noting that Yaron maintained that he thought they referred to the same incident, and that it concerned 45 &quot;dead terrorists&quot;. At the same time, 20:00, a third report came in from liaison officer G. of the Phalangists who in the presence of numerous Israeli officers, including general Yaron, in the dining room, stated that within 2 hours the Phalangists had killed 300 people, including civilians. He returned sometime later and changed the number from 300 to 120.

At 20:40, General Yaron held a briefing, and after it the Divisional Intelligence Officer stated that it appeared no terrorists were in the Shatila camp, and that the Phalangists were in two minds as to what to do with the women, children and old people they had massed together, either to lead them somewhere else or that they were told, as the liaison officer was overheard saying, to &#x27;do what your heart tells you, because everything comes from God.&#x27; Yaron interrupted the officer and said he&#x27;d checked and that &#x27;they have no problems at all,&#x27; and that with regard to the people, &#x27;It will not, will not harm them.&#x27; Yaron later testified he had been sceptical of the reports and had in any case told the Phalangists not to harm civilians. At 21:00 Maj. Amos Gilad predicted during a discussion at Northern Command that, rather than a cleansing of terrorists, what would take place was a massacre, informing higher commanders that already between 120 and 300 had already been killed by that time.

At 23:00 the same evening, a report was sent to the IDF headquarters in East Beirut, reporting the killings of 300 people, including civilians. The report was forwarded to headquarters in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and to the office of the Bureau Chief of the director of Military Intelligence, Lt. Col. Hevroni, at 05:30 the following day where it was seen by more than 20 senior Israeli officers. It was then forwarded to his home by 06:15. That same morning an IDF historian copied down a note, which later disappeared, which he had found in the Northern Command situation room in Aley.

During the night the Phalangists entered the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps. Even though it was agreed that they would not harm civilians, they &#x27;butchered.&#x27; They did not operate in orderly fashion but dispersed. They had casualties, including two killed. They will organize to operate in a more orderly manner—we will see to it that they are moved into the area.&quot;

Early on that morning, between 08:00 and 09:00, several IDF soldiers stationed nearby noted killings were being conducted against the camp refugees. A deputy tank commander some away, Lieutenant Grabowski, saw two Phalangists beating two young men, who were then taken back into the camp, after which shots rang out, and the soldiers left. Sometime later, he saw the Phalangists had killed a group of five women and children. When he expressed a desire to make report, the tank crew said they had already heard a communication informing the battalion commander that civilians had been killed, and that the latter had replied, &quot;We know, it&#x27;s not to our liking, and don&#x27;t interfere.&quot;

At around 08:00, military correspondent Ze&#x27;ev Schiff received a tip-off a source in the General Staff in Tel Aviv that there had been a slaughter in the camps. Checking round for some hours, he got no confirmation other than that there &quot;there&#x27;s something.&quot; At 11:00 he met with Mordechai Tzipori, Minister of Communications and conveyed his information. Unable to reach Military Intelligence by phone, he got in touch with Yitzhak Shamir at 11:19 asking him to check reports of a Phalangist slaughter in the camps. Shamir testified that from his recollection the main thing Tzipori had told him of was that 3/4 IDF soldiers killed, no mention of a massacre or slaughter, as opposed to a &quot;rampage&quot; had been made. He made no check because his impression was that the point of the information was to keep him updated on IDF losses. At a meeting with American diplomats at 12:30 Shamir made no mention of what Tzipori told him, saying he expected that he would hear from Ariel Sharon, the Military Intelligence chief and the American Morris Draper about the situation in West Beirut, At that noontime meeting Sharon insisted that &quot;terrorists&quot; needed &quot;mopping up.&quot; Americans pressed for the intervention of the Lebanese National Army, and for an IDF withdrawal immediately. Sharon replied:

I just don&#x27;t understand, what are you looking for? Do you want the terrorists to stay? Are you afraid that somebody will think that you were in collusion with us? Deny it. We denied it,

adding that nothing would happen except perhaps for a few more terrorists being killed, which would be a benefit to all. Shamir and Sharon finally agreed to a gradual withdrawal, at the end of Rosh Hashana, two days later. Draper then warned them:

Sure, the I.D.F. is going to stay in West Beirut and they will let the Lebanese go and kill the Palestinians in the camps.

Sharon replied:

So, we&#x27;ll kill them. They will not be left there. You are not going to save them. You are not going to save these groups of the international terrorism.. . If you don&#x27;t want the Lebanese to kill them, we will kill them.

In the afternoon, before 16:00, Lieutenant Grabowski had one of his men ask a Phalangist why they were killing civilians, and was told that pregnant women will give birth to children who will grow up to be terrorists.

At Beirut airport at 16:00 journalist Ron Ben-Yishai heard from several Israeli officers that they had heard that killings had taken place in the camps. At 11:30 he telephoned Ariel Sharon to report on the rumours, and was told by Sharon that he had already heard of the stories from the Chief of Staff.
At 16:00 in a meeting with the Phalangist staff, with Mossad present, the Israeli Chief of Staff said he had a &quot;positive impression&quot; of their behavior in the field and from what the Phalangists reported, and asked them to continue &#x27;mopping up the empty camps&#x27; until 5 am, whereupon they must desist due to American pressure. According to the Kahan Commission investigation, neither side explicitly mentioned to each other reports or rumours about the way civilians were being treated in the camp. Between 18:00 and 20:00, Israeli Foreign Ministry personnel in Beirut and in Israel began receiving various reports from U.S. representatives that the Phalangists had been observed in the camps and that their presence was likely to cause problems. On returning to Israel, the Chief of Staff spoke to Ariel Sharon between 20:00 and 21:00, and according to Sharon, informed him that the &quot;Lebanese had gone too far&quot;, and that &quot;the Christians had harmed the civilian population more than was expected.&quot; This, he testified, was the first he had ever heard of Phalangist irregularities in the camps. The Chief of Staff denied they had discussed any killings &quot;beyond what had been expected&quot;.

Later in the afternoon, a meeting was held between the Israeli Chief of Staff and the Phalangist staff.

On the morning of Friday, 17 September, the Israeli Army surrounding Sabra and Shatila ordered the Phalange to halt their operation, concerned about reports of a massacre.

== Foreign reporters&#x27; testimonies ==

On 17 September, while Sabra and Shatila still were sealed off, a few independent observers managed to enter. Among them were a Norwegian journalist and diplomat Gunnar Flakstad, who observed Phalangists during their cleanup operations, removing dead bodies from destroyed houses in the Shatila camp.

Many of the bodies found had been severely mutilated. Young men had been castrated, some were scalped, and some had the Christian cross carved into their bodies.

Janet Lee Stevens, an American journalist, later wrote to her husband, Dr. Franklin Lamb, &quot;I saw dead women in their houses with their skirts up to their waists and their legs spread apart; dozens of young men shot after being lined up against an alley wall; children with their throats slit, a pregnant woman with her stomach chopped open, her eyes still wide open, her blackened face silently screaming in horror; countless babies and toddlers who had been stabbed or ripped apart and who had been thrown into garbage piles.&quot;

Before the massacre, it was reported that the leader of the PLO, Yasir Arafat, had requested the return of international forces, from Italy, France and the United States, to Beirut to protect civilians. Those forces had just supervised the departure of Arafat and his PLO fighters from Beirut. Italy expressed &#x27;deep concerns&#x27; about &#x27;the new Israeli advance&#x27;, but no action was taken to return the forces to Beirut. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in September 1982:

Yasir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, demanded today that the United States, France and Italy send their troops back to Beirut to protect its inhabitants against Israel...&quot;The dignity of three armies and the honor of their countries is involved&quot;, Mr. Arafat said at his news conference. &quot;I ask Italy, France and the United States: What of your promise to protect the inhabitants of Beirut?&quot;

In interviews with film director Lokman Slim in 2005, some of the Lebanese Christian militia fighters reported that, prior to the massacre, the IDF took them to training camps in Israel and showed them documentaries about the Holocaust. The Israelis told the Lebanese fighters that the same would happen to them too, as a minority in Lebanon, if the fighters did not take action against the Palestinians. The film was called &quot;Massaker&quot;, it featured six perpetrators of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and it was awarded the &quot;Fipresci Prize&quot; at the 2005 Berlinale.

==Number of victims==
* Palestinian Red Crescent estimated that over 2,000 had been killed. 1,200 death certificates were issued to anyone who produced three witnesses claiming a family member disappeared during the time of the massacre.
* Bayan Nuwayhed al-Hout in her &quot;Sabra and Shatila: September 1982&quot; gives a minimum consisting of 1,300 named victims based on detailed comparison of 17 victim lists and other supporting evidence, and estimates an even higher total of 3500.
* Robert Fisk wrote, &quot;After three days of rape, fighting and brutal executions, militias finally leave the camps with 1,700 dead&quot;.
* In his book published soon after the massacre, the Israeli journalist Amnon Kapeliouk of &quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&quot;, arrived at about 2,000 bodies disposed of after the massacre from official and Red Cross sources and &quot;very roughly&quot; estimated 1,000 to 1,500 other victims disposed of by the Phalangists themselves to a total of 3,000–3,500.
* In his book, &quot;Sabra &amp; Shatila: Inquiry into a Massacre&quot;, Israeli journalist Amnon Kapeliouk, concluded a maximum of 3,000 to 3,500 people were killed.
* The Lebanese army&#x27;s chief prosecutor, Assad Germanos, investigated the killings, but following orders from above, did not summon Lebanese witnesses. Also Palestinian survivors from the camps were afraid to testify, and Phalangist fighters were expressly forbidden to give testimony. Germanos&#x27; report concluded that 460 people had been killed (including 15 women and 20 children.)
* Israeli intelligence estimated 700–800 dead.

==Role of various parties==
The primary responsibility for the massacre is generally attributed to Elie Hobeika. Robert Maroun Hatem, Elie Hobeika&#x27;s bodyguard, stated in his book &quot;From Israel to Damascus&quot; that Hobeika ordered the massacre of civilians in defiance of Israeli instructions to behave like a &quot;dignified&quot; army.

Hobeika was assassinated by a car bomb in Beirut on 24 January 2002. Lebanese and Arab commentators blamed Israel for the murder of Hobeika, with alleged Israeli motive that Hobeika would be &quot;apparently poised to testify before the Belgian court about Sharon&#x27;s role in the massacre&quot; (see section above). Prior to his assassination, Elie Hobeika had stated &quot;I am very interested that the [Belgian] trial starts because my innocence is a core issue.&quot;

According to Alain Menargues, on 15 September, an Israeli special operations group of Sayeret Matkal entered the camp to liquidate a number of Palestinian cadres, and left the same day. It was followed the next day, by &quot;killers&quot; from the Sa&#x27;ad Haddad&#x27;s South Lebanon Army, before the Lebanese Forces units of Elie Hobeika entered the camps.

The US responsibility was considerable; indeed the Arab states and the PLO blamed the US. The negotiations under the mediation of US diplomat Philip Habib, which oversaw the withdrawal of the PLO from Beirut, had assigned responsibility to the American-led Multinational Force for guaranteeing the safety of those non-combatant Palestinians who remained. The US administration was criticized for the early withdrawal of the Multinational Force, a criticism which George Shultz accepted later. Shultz recounted in his memoirs that &quot;The brutal fact is that we are partially responsible. We took the Israelis and Lebanese at their word&quot;. On 20 September the Multinational Force was redeployed to Beirut.

== Aftermath ==

===U.N. condemnation===

On 16 December 1982, the United Nations General Assembly condemned the massacre and declared it to be an act of genocide.
The voting record on section D of Resolution 37/123 was: yes: 123; no: 0; abstentions: 22; non-voting: 12.

The delegate for Canada stated: &quot;The term genocide cannot, in our view, be applied to this particular inhuman act&quot;. The delegate of Singapore – voting &#x27;yes&#x27; – added: &quot;My delegation regrets the use of the term &#x27;an act of genocide&#x27; ... [as] the term &#x27;genocide&#x27; is used to mean acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.&quot; Canada and Singapore questioned whether the General Assembly was competent to determine whether such an event would constitute genocide. The Soviet Union, by contrast, asserted that: &quot;The word for what Israel is doing on Lebanese soil is genocide. Its purpose is to destroy the Palestinians as a nation.&quot; The Nicaragua delegate asserted: &quot;It is difficult to believe that a people that suffered so much from the Nazi policy of extermination in the middle of the twentieth century would use the same fascist, genocidal arguments and methods against other peoples.&quot;

The United States commented that &quot;While the criminality of the massacre was beyond question, it was a serious and reckless misuse of language to label this tragedy genocide as defined in the 1948 Convention&quot;.

William Schabas, director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland, stated that &quot;there was little discussion of the scope of the term genocide, which had obviously been chosen to embarrass Israel rather than out of any concern with legal precision&quot;.

===Irish Commission (MacBride)===
The independent commission headed by Seán MacBride looking into reported violations of International Law by Israel, however, did find that the concept of genocide applied to the case as it was the intention of those behind the massacre &quot;the deliberate destruction of the national and cultural rights and identity of the Palestinian people&quot;. Individual Jews throughout the world also denounced the massacre as genocide.

The MacBride Commission&#x27;s report, &quot;Israel in Lebanon&quot;, concluded that the Israeli authorities or forces were responsible in the massacres and other killings that have been reported to have been carried out by Lebanese militiamen in Sabra and Shatila in the Beirut area between 16 and 18 September. Unlike the Israeli commission, the McBride Commission did not work with the idea of separate degrees of responsibility, viz., direct and indirect.

===Kahan Commission (Israel)===
Israel&#x27;s own Kahan commission found that only &quot;indirect&quot; responsibility befitted Israel&#x27;s involvement. For British journalist David Hirst, Israel crafted the concept of indirect responsibility so as to make its involvement and responsibility seem smaller. He said of the commission&#x27;s verdict that it was only by means of errors and omissions in the analysis of the massacre that the commission was able to reach the conclusion of indirect responsibility.

The Kahan Commission concluded Israeli Defense minister Sharon bore personal responsibility &quot;for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge&quot; and &quot;not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed&quot;. Sharon&#x27;s negligence in protecting the civilian population of Beirut, which had come under Israeli control, amounted to a non-fulfilment of a duty with which the Defense Minister was charged, and it was recommended that Sharon be dismissed as Defense Minister.

At first, Sharon refused to resign, and Begin refused to fire him. It was only after the death of Emil Grunzweig after a grenade was tossed by a right-wing Israeli into the dispersing crowd of a Peace Now protest march, which also injured ten others, that a compromise was reached: Sharon would resign as Defense Minister, but remain in the Cabinet as a minister without portfolio. Notwithstanding the dissuading conclusions of the Kahan report, Sharon would later become Prime Minister of Israel.

The Kahan commission also recommended the dismissal of Director of Military Intelligence Yehoshua Saguy, and the effective promotion freeze of Division Commander Brig. Gen. Amos Yaron for at least three years.

On 25 September 1982, Peace Now, which had been established 4 years previously, organised in Tel Aviv a protest demonstration which brought to the streets some 10% of Israel’s population, an estimated 400,000 participants. They expressed their anger and demanded an investigation into Israel&#x27;s part and responsibility in the massacre. It would remain Israel&#x27;s largest street protest until the 2023 Israeli judicial reform protests and 7 September 2024 rally for the liberation of hostages in exchange for a cease-fire deal with Hamas.

An opinion poll indicated that 51.7% of the Israeli public thought the commission was too harsh, and only 2.17% too lenient.

===Post-war testimonies by Lebanese Forces operatives===
Lokhman Slim and Monika Borgman&#x27;s &quot;Massaker&quot;, based on 90 hours of interviews with the LF soldiers who participated in the massacre, gives the participants&#x27; memories of how they were drawn into the militia, trained with the Israeli army and unleashed on the camps to take revenge for the murder of Bachir Gemayel. The motivations are varied, from blaming beatings from their fathers in childhood, the effects of the brutalization of war, obedience to one&#x27;s leaders, a belief that the camp women would breed future terrorists, and the idea three-quarters of the residents were terrorists. Others spoke of their violence without traces of repentance.

=== Lawsuits against Sharon ===
==== Sharon&#x27;s libel suit ====
Ariel Sharon sued &quot;Time&quot; magazine for libel in American and Israeli courts in a $50 million suit, after &quot;Time&quot; published a story in its 21 February 1983, issue, implying that Sharon had &quot;reportedly discussed with the Gemayels the need for the Phalangists to take revenge&quot; for Bachir&#x27;s assassination. The jury found the article false and defamatory, although &quot;Time&quot; won the suit in the U.S. court because Sharon&#x27;s defense failed to establish that the magazine&#x27;s editors and writers had &quot;acted out of malice&quot;, as required under U.S. libel law.

==== Relatives of victims sue Sharon ====
After Sharon&#x27;s 2001 election as Israeli Prime Minister, relatives of the victims of the massacre filed a lawsuit. On 24 September 2003, Belgium&#x27;s Supreme Court dismissed the war crimes case against Ariel Sharon, since none of the plaintiffs had Belgian nationality at the start of the case.

=== Reprisal attacks ===
According to Robert Fisk, Osama bin Laden cited the Sabra and Shatila massacre as one of the motivations for the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, in which al-Qaeda attacked an American Air Force housing complex in Saudi Arabia.

<text>Sir Edward Richard George Heath (9 July 1916 – 17 July 2005), commonly known as Ted Heath, was a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1970 to 1974 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1965 to 1975. Heath also served for 51 years as a Member of Parliament from 1950 to 2001. Outside politics, Heath was a yachtsman, a musician, and an author.

Born in Broadstairs, Kent, Heath was the son of a chambermaid and carpenter. He attended Chatham House Grammar School in Ramsgate, Kent, and became a leader within student politics while studying at Balliol College at the University of Oxford. During World War II, Heath served as an officer in the Royal Artillery. He worked briefly in the Civil Service, but resigned in order to stand for Parliament, and was elected for Bexley at the 1950 election. He was promoted to become Chief Whip by Anthony Eden in 1955, and in 1959 was appointed to the Cabinet by Harold Macmillan as Minister of Labour. He later held the role of Lord Privy Seal and in 1963, was made President of the Board of Trade by Alec Douglas-Home. After the Conservatives were defeated at the 1964 election, Heath was elected as Leader of the Conservative Party in 1965, becoming Leader of the Opposition. Although he led the Conservatives to a landslide defeat at the 1966 election, he remained in the leadership, and at the 1970 election led his party to an unexpected victory.

During his time as prime minister, Heath oversaw the decimalisation of British coinage in 1971, and in 1972 he led the reformation of local government, significantly reducing the number of local authorities and creating several new metropolitan counties, much of which remains to this day. A strong supporter of British membership of the European Economic Community (EEC), Heath&#x27;s &quot;finest hour&quot; came in 1973, when he led the United Kingdom into membership of what would later become the European Union. However, his premiership also coincided with the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, with his approval of internment without trial and subsequent suspension of the Stormont Parliament seeing the imposition of direct British rule. Unofficial talks with Provisional Irish Republican Army delegates were unsuccessful, as was the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973, which led the MPs of the Ulster Unionist Party to withdraw from the Conservative whip. Heath also tried to reform British trade unionism with the Industrial Relations Act, and hoped to deregulate the economy and make a transfer from direct to indirect taxation, such as with the introduction of value-added tax in 1973. However, a miners&#x27; strike at the start of 1974 severely damaged the Government, causing the implementation of the Three-Day Week to conserve energy. Attempting to resolve the situation, Heath called an election for February 1974, attempting to obtain a mandate to face down the miners&#x27; wage demands, but this instead resulted in a hung parliament, with the Conservatives losing their majority. Despite gaining fewer votes, the Labour Party won four more seats, and Heath resigned as Prime Minister on 4 March after talks with the Liberal Party to form a coalition government were unsuccessful.

After losing a second successive election in October 1974, Heath&#x27;s leadership was challenged by Margaret Thatcher and, on 4 February, she narrowly outpolled him in the first round. Heath chose to resign the leadership rather than contest the second round, returning to the backbenches, where he would remain until 2001. In 1975, he played a major role in the referendum on British membership of the EEC, campaigning for the eventually successful &quot;remain&quot; vote. Heath would later become an embittered critic of Thatcher during her time as prime minister, speaking and writing against the policies of Thatcherism. Following the 1992 election, he became Father of the House, until his retirement from the Commons in 2001. He died in 2005, aged 89. Heath has been described by the BBC as &quot;the first working-class meritocrat&quot; to become Conservative leader in &quot;the party&#x27;s modern history&quot; and &quot;a One Nation Tory in the Disraeli tradition who rejected the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism that Thatcher would enthusiastically endorse.&quot;

==Early life==
Heath was born at 54 Albion Road, Broadstairs, Kent, on 9 July 1916, the son of William George Heath (1888–1976), a carpenter who built airframes for Vickers during the First World War, and was subsequently employed as a builder and Edith Anne Heath (&quot;née&quot; Pantony; 1888–1951), a lady&#x27;s maid. His father was later a successful small businessman after taking over a building and decorating firm. Heath&#x27;s paternal grandfather had run a small dairy business, and when that failed worked as a porter at Broadstairs Station on the Southern Railway. Edward was four years old when his younger brother, John, was born; there was no question that Edward was the &quot;favoured brother&quot;. Heath was known as &quot;Teddy&quot; as a young man. He was educated at Chatham House Grammar School in Ramsgate, and in 1935 with the aid of a county scholarship he went up to study at Balliol College, Oxford.

In later years, Heath&#x27;s peculiar accent, with its &quot;strangulated&quot; vowel sounds, combined with his non-Standard pronunciation of &quot;l&quot; as &quot;w&quot; and &quot;out&quot; as &quot;eout&quot;, was satirised by Monty Python in the audio sketch &quot;Teach Yourself Heath&quot; (released on a 7&quot; flexi-disc single included with initial copies of their 1972 LP &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Previous Record&quot;). Heath&#x27;s biographer John Campbell speculates that his speech, unlike that of his father and younger brother, who both spoke with Kent accents, must have undergone &quot;drastic alteration on encountering Oxford&quot;, although retaining elements of Kent speech.

==Oxford==
A talented musician, Heath won the college&#x27;s organ scholarship in his first term (he had previously tried for the organ scholarships at St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and Keble College, Oxford) which enabled him to stay at the university for a fourth year; he eventually graduated with a Second Class Honours BA in Philosophy, politics and economics in 1939.

While at university Heath became active in Conservative Party politics. On the key political issue of the day, foreign policy, he opposed the Conservative-dominated government of the day ever more openly. His first Paper Speech (i.e. a major speech listed on the Order Paper along with the visiting guest speakers) at the Oxford Union, in 1936, was in opposition to the appeasement of Germany by returning her colonies, confiscated during the First World War.

In June 1937 Heath was elected President of the Oxford University Conservative Association as a pro-Spanish Republic candidate, in opposition to the pro-Franco John Stokes (himself later a Conservative MP). In 1937–38 Heath was chairman of the national Federation of University Conservative Associations, and in the same year (his third at university) he was Secretary and then Librarian of the Oxford Union. At the end of the year he was defeated for the Presidency of the Oxford Union by another Balliol candidate, Alan Wood, on the issue of whether the Chamberlain government should give way to a left-wing Popular Front. On that occasion, Heath supported the government.

In his final year Heath was President of Balliol College Junior Common Room, an office held in subsequent years by his near-contemporaries Denis Healey, who would become a lifelong friend and political rival and Roy Jenkins, and as such was invited to support the Master of Balliol Alexander Lindsay, who stood as an anti-appeasement &#x27;Independent Progressive&#x27; candidate against the official Conservative candidate, Quintin Hogg, in the 1938 Oxford by-election.

Heath, who had himself applied to be the Conservative candidate for the by-election, accused the government in an October Union Debate of &quot;turning all four cheeks&quot; to Adolf Hitler, and was elected as President of the Oxford Union in November 1938, sponsored by Balliol, after winning the Presidential Debate that &quot;This House has No Confidence in the National Government as presently constituted&quot;. He was thus President in Hilary term 1939; the visiting Leo Amery described him in his diaries as &quot;a pleasant youth&quot;.

As an undergraduate, Heath travelled widely in Europe. His opposition to appeasement was nourished by his witnessing first-hand a Nuremberg rally in 1937, where he met leading Nazis Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, and Heinrich Himmler at an SS cocktail party. He later described Himmler as &quot;the most evil man I have ever met&quot;. He was in Germany for two months to learn German but did not keep up any fluency in the language in later life. In 1938 he visited Barcelona, then under attack from Spanish Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War. On one occasion a car in which he was travelling came under machine-gun fire, while on another a bomb hit his hotel whilst he was observing an air raid from outside. In the summer of 1939, accompanied by his Jewish friend Madron Seligman, he travelled to Danzig and Poland. They made the return journey by hitchhiking and rail across Germany through mobilising troops, returning to Britain just before the declaration of war.

==Second World War==
Heath spent late 1939 and early 1940 on a debating tour of the United States before being called up. On 22 March 1941, he received an emergency commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. During the war he initially served with heavy anti-aircraft guns around Liverpool (which suffered heavy German bombing raids in May 1941) and by early 1942 was regimental adjutant, with the substantive rank of captain.

Heath participated as an adjutant in the Normandy landings, where he met Maurice Schumann, French Foreign Minister under Pompidou. As a temporary major commanding a battery of his own, he provided artillery support during the Allied campaigns in France and Germany in 1944–45, for which he received a mention in despatches on 8 November 1945.

Heath later remarked that &quot;[it&#x27;s] one thing to be in the war, and you see the enemy on the other side and so you bombard them, and then later on when you pass over their ground, you see dead bodies lying around&quot;. In September 1945 he commanded a firing squad that executed a Polish soldier convicted of rape and murder. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division (MBE) on 24 January 1946. He was demobilised in August 1946 and promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel on 1 May 1947.

Heath joined the Honourable Artillery Company as a lieutenant-colonel on 1 September 1951, in which he remained active throughout the 1950s, rising to commanding officer of the Second Battalion; a portrait of him in full dress uniform still hangs in the Queens Room of the HAC&#x27;s Armoury House. In April 1971, as prime minister, he wore his lieutenant-colonel&#x27;s insignia to inspect troops.

==Post-war, 1945–1950==
Before the war, Heath had won a scholarship to Gray&#x27;s Inn and had begun making preparations for a career at the Bar, but after the war he was placed in joint top position in the civil service examinations. He then became a civil servant in the Ministry of Civil Aviation (he was disappointed not to be posted to the Treasury, but declined an offer to join the Foreign Office, fearing that foreign postings might prevent him from entering politics).

Heath joined a team under Alison Munro tasked with drawing up a scheme for British airports using some of the many Second World War RAF bases, and was specifically charged with planning the home counties. Years later she attributed his evident enthusiasm for Maplin Airport to this work. Then much to the surprise of civil service colleagues, he sought adoption as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Bexley and resigned in November 1947.

After working as news editor of the &quot;Church Times&quot; from February 1948 to September 1949, Heath worked as a management trainee at the merchant bankers Brown, Shipley &amp; Co. until his election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bexley in the February 1950 general election. In the election he defeated an old contemporary from the Oxford Union, Ashley Bramall, by a margin of 133 votes.

== Early political career (1950–1965)==
===Member of Parliament===

Heath made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 26 June 1950, in which he appealed to the Labour government to participate in the Schuman Plan. As MP for Bexley, he gave enthusiastic speeches in support of the young candidate for neighbouring Dartford, Margaret Roberts, later Margaret Thatcher.

He was appointed as an opposition whip by Winston Churchill in February 1951. He remained in the whips&#x27; office after the Conservatives won the 1951 general election, rising rapidly to Joint Deputy Chief Whip, Deputy Chief Whip and, in December 1955, Government Chief Whip under Anthony Eden. Journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft has observed that &quot;Of all government jobs, this requires firmness and fairness allied to tact and patience and Heath&#x27;s ascent seems baffling in hindsight&quot;.

=== In office ===
Due to the convention that whips did not speak in Parliament, Heath managed to keep out of the controversy over the Suez Crisis. On the announcement of Eden&#x27;s resignation, Heath submitted a report on the opinions of the Conservative MPs regarding Eden&#x27;s possible successors. This report favoured Harold Macmillan and helped to secure Macmillan the premiership in January 1957. Macmillan later appointed Heath Minister of Labour, a Cabinet Minister—as Chief Whip Heath had attended Cabinet, but had not been formally a member—after winning the October 1959 election.

In 1960 Macmillan appointed Heath Lord Privy Seal with responsibility for the negotiations to secure the UK&#x27;s first attempt to join the European Communities (or Common Market, as it was then more widely known). After extensive negotiations, involving detailed agreements about the UK&#x27;s agricultural trade with Commonwealth countries such as New Zealand, British entry was vetoed by the French President, Charles de Gaulle, at a press conference in January 1963 – much to the disappointment of Heath, who was a firm supporter of European common market membership for the United Kingdom. He oversaw a successful application when serving as prime minister a decade later.

After this setback, a major humiliation for Macmillan&#x27;s foreign policy, Heath was not a contender for the party leadership on Macmillan&#x27;s retirement in October 1963. Under prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home he was President of the Board of Trade and Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development, and oversaw the abolition of retail price maintenance, as well as the move of the August Bank Holiday to extend the holiday season and reduce congestion.

==Leader of the Opposition (1965–1970)==

=== Party leadership ===

After the Conservative Party lost the general election of 1964, the defeated Home changed the party leadership rules to allow for a ballot by MPs and then, in July 1965, he resigned. Heath—who was Shadow Chancellor at the time, and had recently won favourable publicity for leading the fight against Labour&#x27;s Finance Bill—unexpectedly won the party&#x27;s leadership contest, gaining 150 votes to Reginald Maudling&#x27;s 133 and Enoch Powell&#x27;s 15. Heath became the Conservatives&#x27; youngest leader and retained office following the party&#x27;s defeat in the general election of 1966.

In April 1968 Enoch Powell made his controversial &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech, which criticised immigration to the United Kingdom. Soon afterwards Heath telephoned Margaret Thatcher to inform her that he was going to sack Powell from the Shadow cabinet; she recalled that she &quot;really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis&quot;. The next day Heath sacked Powell. Several Conservatives on the right protested against Powell&#x27;s sacking. According to Heath, he never spoke to Powell again.

=== 1970 election ===
With another general election approaching in 1970 a Conservative policy document emerged from the Selsdon Park Hotel that offered free-market–oriented policies as solutions to the country&#x27;s unemployment and inflation problems. Heath stated that the Selsdon weekend only reaffirmed policies that had actually been evolving since he became leader of the Conservative Party. The Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, thought the document a vote-loser and dubbed it the product of &quot;Selsdon Man&quot; – after the supposedly prehistoric &quot;Piltdown Man&quot; – to portray it as reactionary. Heath&#x27;s Conservative Party won the general election of 1970 with 330 seats to Labour&#x27;s 287. The new cabinet included the future prime minister Margaret Thatcher (Education and Science), William Whitelaw (Leader of the House of Commons) and the former prime minister Alec Douglas-Home (Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs).

==Prime minister (1970–1974)==

===Welfare state===
During Heath&#x27;s first year in office, higher charges were introduced for benefits of the welfare state such as school meals, spectacles, dentistry, and prescriptions. Entitlement to State Sickness Benefit was also changed so that it would only be paid after the first three days of sickness. In 1971 a series of measures was introduced designed to limit the availability of supplementary benefit. In particular, as noted by one study, &quot;tax rebates and strike pay were treated as resources, subject to a £4 disregard.&quot; From April 1972 a man returning from work after being on strike had to pay back any supplementary benefit received to tide him over during the first 15 days at work before he got his pay. In February 1973, the rules about help in urgent cases were made more stringent. As a result of the squeeze in the education budget, the provision of free school milk was ended for 8- to 11-year-olds (it had already been ended for older children by Harold Wilson); the tabloid press christened Margaret Thatcher, the then Education Secretary as &quot;Margaret Thatcher: Milk Snatcher&quot;. Despite these measures, the Heath government encouraged a significant increase in welfare spending, and Thatcher blocked Macleod&#x27;s other posthumous education policy: the abolition of the Open University, which had recently been founded by the preceding Labour government. In addition, despite the end of cheap milk provision however, 700,000 school children remained entitled to free milk. The Legal Advice and Assistance Act 1972 provided for better facilities for advice and assistance at an early stage in a dispute. The Social Needs (Grants) Act 9NI) 1970 &quot;made provision for the authorisation of the payment of grants towards expenditure incurred due to special social need in urban areas.&quot; In January 1973, the Criminal Justice Act 1972 came into effect in England and Wales. It extended the court&#x27;s power &quot;to order an offender to pay compensation for personal injury, loss, or damage.&quot; In June 1973 a new lower rate of attendance allowance was introduced for those aged 16 to 64, while lower rates &quot;for the aged under 15 and those over 65 were introduced on 1 October and 3 December respectively.&quot; Another change allowed for small claims of less than £75 to be dealt with in a less formal manner within the County Court system. Rules of evidence and requirements of legal representation were relaxed to make it viable to claim such small sums under the County Court Act 1959 as amended by the Administration of Justice Act (E&amp;W) 1973. The Land Compensation Act of 1973 “increased compensation for persons displaced by public development projects.”

Provision was made under the National Insurance (Old Persons&#x27; and Widows&#x27; Pensions and Attendances Allowances) Act 1970 for pensions to be paid to old people who had been excluded from the pre-1948 pension schemes and were accordingly excluded from the comprehensive scheme that was introduced in 1948. About 100,000 people were affected by this change, half of whom were receiving Supplementary Benefit under the social security scheme. The Act also made improvements to the Widow&#x27;s Pension scheme by introducing a scale that started at 30 shillings a week for women widowed at the age of 40 and rose to the full rate of £5 at the age of 50.

Considerable support was provided for nursery school building, and a long-term capital investment programme in school building was launched. A Family Fund was set up to assist families with children who had congenital conditions, while new benefits were introduced benefiting hundreds of thousands of disabled persons whose disabilities had been caused neither by war nor by industrial injury. An Attendance Allowance was introduced for those needing care at home, together with Invalidity Benefit for the long-term sick, while a higher Child Allowance was made available where invalidity allowance was paid. Widow&#x27;s Benefits were introduced for those aged between forty and fifty years of age, improved subsidies for slum clearance were made available, while Rent Allowances were introduced for private tenants. In April 1971, the right to education was given to all children with Down&#x27;s syndrome for the first time. The National Insurance (Married Women) Amendment Regulations 1971 extended the provisions of the National Insurance (Married Women) Regulations 1948. The Pneumoconiosis, Byssinosis and Miscellaneous Diseases Benefit (Amendment) Scheme of 1971 made various improvements to the previous Pneumoconiosis, Byssinosis and Miscellaneous Diseases Benefit scheme introduced in 1966. The Workmen’s Compensation (Supplementation) Amendment Scheme 1971 increased the weekly rate of lesser incapacity allowance that was payable under certain circumstances. Provision was also made (in regards to interest on compensation for injurious affection where no land is taken) for interest to payable on injurious affection, for the injurious affection claim, on farm loss payments, and on disturbance payments.

The school leaving age was raised to 16, while Family Income Supplement was introduced to boost the incomes of low-income earners. Families who received this benefit were exempted from NHS charges while the children in such families were eligible for free school meals. Non-contributory pensions were also introduced for all persons aged eighty and above, while the Social Security Act 1973 was passed which introduced benefit indexation in the United Kingdom for the first time by index-linking benefits to prices to maintain their real value. An amendment to the Social Security Act of 1973 required the secretary of state to publicize benefits for the disabled. The National Insurance Act of 1971 introduced a special addition with no means test for all pensioners over 80, while in 1972 a £10 Christmas bonus was introduced. Annual upratings for all pensioners was also introduced. From October 1973 onwards a higher &#x27; long – term rate &#x27; of supplementary benefit &quot;was paid to those who had received supplementary benefit for a continuous period.&quot; A decision was also made (from October 1973 onwards) to uprate long-term benefits by a larger amount than short-term benefits. That same year, a basic short-term rates were introduced for everyone else; the short-term sick and unemployed in the main. From 1972 onwards, &quot;while there is no statutory commitment to this effect, the same cash increases have been made in the leading supplementary benefit scale rates as in their national insurance counterparts.&quot; In 1973, a statutory commitment to uprate national insurance benefits in line with prices was introduced in 1973. The Industrial Relations Act of 1971 gave employees &quot;the right, depending on a minimum qualifying period, to appeal to an industrial tribunal, where compensation for unfair dismissal could be awarded based on length of service,&quot; and in 1972 preservation of accrued pension benefits after 5 or more years&#x27; service was introduced. The Legal Advice and Assistance Act 1972 set up a Green Form scheme under which advice of up to two hours, free of charge to the poorest or at reduced rates to those of modest means, became available. The Housing Finance Act 1972 &quot;introduced a national formula for rent increases in the public sector and a mandatory system of local rent and rate rebates that survived subsequent legislation.&quot; The Supplementary Benefit (Determination of Requirements) Regulations 1972 increased the rent addition for non-householders and removed the present age qualification. The Students&#x27; Dependents&#x27; Allowances Regulations 1973 enabled the Secretary of State &quot;to pay allowances to students attending first degree university etc. courses and courses for the training of teachers.&quot; A social security amendment of 1973 provided for allowing the Supplementary Benefits Commission &quot;to make payments to cover funeral expenses without having regard to the powers of local authorities, so that the commission will not be inhibited by the fact that local authorities have certain powers concerning the disposal of bodies.&quot; Subsequently, the Commission &quot;revised its policy on payments towards funeral expenses . Claimants are no longer advised to ask the Local Authority to make funeral arrangements, and the Commission will consider paying towards the costs of a private funeral under its powers to meet exceptional needs.&quot;

The Redundant Mineworkers and Concessionary Coal (Payments Schemes) Order 1973 provided for three new types of benefits, including &quot;lump sums based on length of service for men redundant between age 35 and 55, and for men over 55 who due to lack of service in the industry do not qualify for basic benefit; a new benefit equivalent to the current rate of unemployment benefit to be paid to men when they have exhausted their 156 weeks of basic benefit until they reach age 65; and concessionary coal benefits for men made redundant between age 55 and 60, and certain men redundant over age 60. (Most men redundant over age 60 already receive concessionary coal under existing arrangements.) In addition, &quot;The amount of benefit which a beneficiary may retain if he obtains other employment has also been increased.&quot; The Employment and Training Act 1973 included various provisions. For instance, as specified in the text of the Act, &quot;The Secretary of State may— pay to any person appointed in pursuance of the preceding paragraph such subsistence and travelling allowances and such compensation for loss of remunerative time as the Secretary of State may determine with the approval of the Minister for the Civil Service.&quot; In addition, &quot;An industrial training board may— pay maintenance and travelling allowances to persons attending courses provided or approved by the board; make grants or loans to persons providing courses or other facilities approved by the board, to persons who make studies for the purpose of providing such courses or facilities and to persons who maintain arrangements to provide such courses or facilities which are not for the time being in use; pay fees to persons providing further education in respect of persons who receive it in association with their training in courses provided or approved by the board; make payments to persons in connection with arrangements under which they or employees of theirs make use of courses or other facilities provided or approved by the board.&quot;

The Redundant Mineworkers (Payments Scheme) Order 1972 was intended to be make available for 3 years &quot;to any miner who is made redundant after he has reached 55 to help him to adjust to the new situation and to the difficulties which confront him.&quot; It included a number of provisions for miners and their dependents including the addition of cost of living increments, a basic scheme benefit, an increase from £3 to £6 a week to the benefit &quot;which can be kept if a redundant mineworker finds a new job and enters new employment, because if he did he would probably incur income tax, perhaps National Insurance contributions, travelling expenses and other expenses which might well have exceeded the £3 which he would have been able to draw if he had continued to draw that from the redundant mineworkers payment scheme.&quot; The rent allowance which is payable to a redundant mineworker was made transferable to a new house if he were to move his home, the rules regarding the offsetting of State and other coal industry benefits against the total of the mineworkers&#x27; redundancy payment benefit were eased, and the scheme was changed &quot;so that in the event of a second redundancy—if a miner is made redundant a second time—his earnings are computed on the wages paid in the year immediately before the second redundancy as opposed to his previous level of earnings.&quot; Also, &quot;these last three concessions will apply to men who are in the existing scheme, not only to miners who might be made redundant in future, but to all those who are part of the existing scheme at the present time.&quot; The scheme also provided that the general increases in benefits, such as the special hardship allowance and workmen&#x27;s compensation supplementation would not be offset as at present, and also provided for increases in benefits paid to men on workmen&#x27;s compensation as a result of becoming total or major incapacity cases, award of special hardship allowance in respect of an accident or disease sustained after redundancies. In addition, &quot;any general increase in unemployment benefit between 6th April, 1972, and 6th April, 1973, will be offset against the benefit of men made redundant after 6th April, 1973.&quot; Also, &quot;the maximum amount of benefit that can be kept by those who get a job is increased from £3 to £6&quot; weekly, and &quot;the table of basic benefit appropriate to the various ranges of pre-redundancy earnings set out in Appendix 4 has been recalculated so that the basic benefit, plus the 1971 rate of unemployment benefit for a man and one adult dependant, equals, after tax and on average over the three years, 90 per cent. of previous take-home pay.&quot; Other provisions included service in the coal industry &quot;before nationalisation can now count towards the 10 qualifying years&quot; and that women &quot;who are not paying the full National Insurance stamp will be able to get some benefit despite not being eligible for unemployment benefit.&quot; In addition, &quot;days of absence from home which disqualify a person from unemployment benefit, and also from 72 scheme benefit, will be counted as days rather than one day in a week resulting in a whole week&#x27;s disqualification as at present.&quot; Also, &quot;a man made redundant within the terms of the scheme and reemployed in the coal industry for more than a year and then made redundant a second time can choose on which of the two pre-redundancy earnings he wishes his benefit to be calculated.&quot; In addition, &quot;the requirement that in order to continue getting the rent allowance a person must continue to live in the same house in which he was living when he was made redundant, and that this house must continue to be owned by the board, is removed.&quot; Also, &quot;the relevant tax year on which pre-redundancy earnings are based will now be the previous tax year for everybody, instead of being two years ago for those made redundant during April.&quot; Also, as noted by one MP, &quot;Following the introduction of the first redundant mineworkers payments scheme in 1968, which provided benefits for men aged 55 or over on redundancy who otherwise satisfied the requirements of the scheme, there was pressure to enhance the terms available to enable such men to receive concessionary coal as though they had reached normal retirement age. The Government responded to this pressure in the Coal Industry Act 1973, amending the power to make schemes benefiting redundant mineworkers in the 1967 Act.&quot; Also in 1973, the first concessionary coal payments scheme was introduced by order, which provided for reimbursement to the National Coal Board &quot;of the full cost of concessionary coal to men aged 55 to 59 who qualified for benefits under the redundant mineworkers payments scheme from 14 December 1969, and half the cost of providing concessionary coal to such men age 60 to 65.&quot;

A number of new superannuation provisions were introduced for various categories of workers. For those in the NHS, this included years and days used in benefit calculations instead of years and half years, the introduction of practitioner dynamising introduced i.e. 1.4% pensions, best of the last 3 years Total Superannuable Remuneration introduced instead of average of last 3 years, 3 x lump sum introduced for post 24 March 1972 service (married men), the introduction of a half rate widow&#x27;s pension (was previously 1/3), a new rate of Child Allowance, a reduction in the qualifying period for pensions from 10 years to 5 years, the abolition of the qualifying period for Death Gratuities (DG), the introduction of double incapacity build up for service between 5 years and 9 years 364 days (or to age 65 if less), the introduction of 3 months initial widows pension, the introduction of widows limited pension (for 3, 4.5 or 6 months) for those widows who do not have title to continuing widows pensions, the introduction of a Limited Child Allowance, the introduction of automatic payment of benefits at age 70, the introduction of Added Years purchase, &quot;Pensions Increase Supplement may apply&quot; from January 1973 to October 1975, the extension of service to take account of untaken annual leave introduced for ancillary staff, and &quot;Part time service may be superannuable provided half or more of the w/t basic is worked.&quot; The Pensions (Increase) Act of 1971 provided for regular increases in public service pensions by statutory instrument. The Act was later amended in 1972 and 1974 &quot;to lower the minimum qualifying age for pensions increase from 60 to 55 and to provide for all pensions paid to widows of scheme members to be increased.&quot;

The Superannuation Act of 1972 provided for new arrangements for premature retirement on grounds of limited efficiency, granted civil servants rights to their pensions and established the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme, the Civil Service Additional Voluntary Contribution Scheme (CSAVCS), the Civil Service Compensation Scheme (CSCS) and the Civil Service Injury Benefits Scheme (CSIBS). The Local Government (Retirement of Chief Officers) Regulations 1973 provided &quot;for persons identified as chief officers and deputy chief officers of local authorities, and certain other persons affected by local government reorganisation, to elect for early retirement on enhanced pension terms and thereby forgo any right to claim compensation which might otherwise have been exercised under section 259 of the Local Government Act 1972.&quot; Section 27 of the Water Act 1973 empowered water authorities to establish and administer pension schemes and funds. The Social Security Act of 1973 made further provisions &quot;for occupational pensions, established the Occupational Pensions Board and the contributory reserve pension scheme under a Reserve Pension Board for not recognised pensionable employment.&quot;

===Scottish nationalism===
Scottish nationalism grew as a political force, while the decimalisation of British coinage, begun under the previous Labour government, was completed eight months after Heath came to power. The Central Policy Review Staff was established by Heath in February 1971, while the Local Government Act 1972 changed the boundaries of the counties of England and Wales and created Metropolitan Counties around the major cities (e.g. Merseyside around Liverpool): this caused significant public anger. Heath did not divide England into regions, choosing instead to await the report of the Crowther Commission on the constitution; the 10 Government Office Regions were eventually set up by the Major government in 1994.

===Economic policy===
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Iain Macleod, died and was replaced on 20 July 1970 by Anthony Barber. Heath&#x27;s planned economic policy changes (including a significant shift from direct to indirect taxation) remained largely unimplemented: the Selsdon policy document was more or less abandoned as unemployment increased considerably by 1972. By January that year, the number of unemployed reached a million, the highest level for more than two decades. Opposed to unemployment on moral grounds, Heath encouraged a famous &quot;U-Turn&quot; in economic policy that precipitated what became known as the &quot;Barber Boom&quot;. This was a two-range process involving the budgets of 1972 and 1973, the former of which pumped £2.5 billion into the economy in increased pensions and benefits and tax reductions. By early 1974, as a result of this Keynesian economic strategy, unemployment had fallen to under 550,000. The economic boom did not last, and the Heath government implemented various cuts that led to the abandonment of policy goals such as a planned expansion of nursery education.

===Trade unions===
Much of the government&#x27;s attention, as well as the media and public opinion, focused on deteriorating labour relations, as the government sought to weaken the economic power of the trade unions, which had grown steadily since 1945. The Industrial Relations Act 1971 set up a special court under the judge Lord Donaldson. Its imprisonment of striking dockworkers was a public relations disaster and became an object lesson for the Thatcher government of the 1980s. Thatcher relied instead on confiscating the assets of unions that courts found to have violated anti-strike laws.

The trade unions responded with a full-scale counterattack on a government hobbled by inflation and high unemployment. Especially damaging to the government&#x27;s credibility were the two miners&#x27; strikes of 1972 and 1974, the latter of which resulted in much of the country&#x27;s industry working a Three-Day Week in an attempt to conserve energy. The National Union of Mineworkers won its case but the energy shortages and the resulting breakdown of domestic consensus contributed to the eventual downfall of his government.

===Unemployment===
There was a steep rise in unemployment for the first two years of the Heath ministry, but it was then reversed. Labour in 1964 had inherited an unemployment count of around 400,000 but saw unemployment peak at 631,000 in early 1967. At election time in June 1970, the unemployment numbers were still high at 582,000. Heath and the Conservatives were pledged to &quot;full employment&quot; but within a year it became clear that they were losing that battle, as the official unemployment count crept towards 1,000,000 and some newspapers suggested that it was even higher. In January 1972 it was officially confirmed that unemployment had risen above 1,000,000 – a level not seen for more than 30 years. Various other reports around this time suggested that unemployment was higher still, with &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper claiming that &quot;nearly 3,000,000&quot; people were jobless by March of that year.

===Foreign policy===

Upon entering office in June 1970, Heath immediately set about trying to reverse Wilson&#x27;s policy of ending Britain&#x27;s military presence East of Suez. Heath took the United Kingdom into Europe on 1 January 1973, following passage in Parliament of the European Communities Act 1972 in October.

He publicly supported the massive U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong in December 1972.

According to John McEvoy and Mark Curtis of Declassified UK, his government quickly recognised the military regime of Augusto Pinochet in Chile and maintained good relations with it, despite the illegal nature of the Pinochet regime&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état.

In October 1973 he placed a British arms embargo on all combatants in the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War, which mostly affected the Israelis by preventing them obtaining spares for their Centurion tanks. Heath refused to allow US intelligence gathering from British bases in Cyprus, resulting in a temporary halt in the US signals intelligence tap.

He favoured links with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, visiting Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1974 and 1975 and remaining an honoured guest in China on frequent visits thereafter and forming a close relationship with Mao&#x27;s successor Deng Xiaoping. Heath realised that to become closer to Europe he needed to be further from the United States, so he downplayed the Special Relationship that had long knitted the two nations together. The two nations differed on such major crises as Britain&#x27;s EC membership, the Nixon economic &quot;shocks&quot; of 1971, the Bangladesh Liberation War, détente with Soviet Union, Kissinger&#x27;s Year of Europe and the Middle East crisis of 1973.

===Northern Ireland===

Heath served as Prime Minister during an especially violent period of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Events such as the Falls Curfew, Operation Motorman and Bloody Sunday led to the near-collapse in relations between the Irish Catholic community and British security forces. In 1971, Heath sent MI6 officer Frank Steele to hold talks with the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and find common ground to begin official negotiations. In July 1972, Heath permitted the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw, to hold unofficial talks in London with an IRA delegation by Seán Mac Stíofáin. In the aftermath of these unsuccessful talks, Heath pushed for a peaceful settlement with Northern Irish political parties exclusively committed to nonviolence.

The 1973 Sunningdale Agreement, which proposed a power-sharing deal, was strongly repudiated by many Unionists, including the Ulster Unionist Party, which withdrew its MPs at Westminster from the Conservative whip. The proposal was finally brought down by the Unionist Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike in 1974, by which time Heath was no longer in office.

Heath was targeted by the IRA for introducing internment without trial in Northern Ireland. In December 1974, an IRA active service unit threw a bomb onto the first-floor balcony of his home in Wilton Street, Belgravia where it exploded. Heath had been conducting a Christmas carol concert at Broadstairs and arrived home 10 minutes after the bomb exploded. No one was injured in the attack, but a landscape painted by Winston Churchill – given to Heath as a present – was damaged. In January 2003, Heath gave evidence to the Saville Inquiry and stated that he had never sanctioned unlawful lethal force in Northern Ireland.

==Fall from power==


===1974 general elections===
Heath tried to bolster his government by calling a general election for 28 February 1974, using the election slogan &quot;Who governs Britain?&quot;. The result of the election was inconclusive with no party gaining an overall majority in the House of Commons; the Conservatives had the most votes but Labour had slightly more seats. Heath began negotiations with Jeremy Thorpe, leader of the Liberal Party, but when these failed, he resigned as prime minister on 4 March 1974, and was replaced by Wilson&#x27;s minority Labour government, eventually confirmed, though with a tiny majority, in a second election in October. To date, Heath is the last British Prime Minister to have both assumed and lost their term of office by means of a general election.

===Rise of Thatcher===
Heath came to be seen as a liability by many Conservative MPs, party activists and newspaper editors. His personality was considered cold and aloof, annoying even to his friends. Alan Watkins observed in 1991 that his &quot;brusqueness, his gaucherie, his lack of small or indeed any talk, his sheer bad manners&quot; were among the factors costing him the support of Conservative backbenchers in the subsequent Conservative leadership election.

He resolved to remain Conservative leader, even after losing the October 1974 general election, and at first it appeared that by calling on the loyalty of his front-bench colleagues he might prevail. In the weeks following the second election defeat, Heath came under tremendous pressure to concede a review of the rules and agreed to establish a commission to propose changes and to seek re-election. There was no clear challenger after Enoch Powell had left the party and Keith Joseph had ruled himself out after controversial statements implying that the working classes should be encouraged to use more birth control. Joseph&#x27;s close friend and ally Margaret Thatcher, who believed that an adherent to the philosophy of the Centre for Policy Studies should stand, joined the leadership contest in his place alongside the outsider Hugh Fraser. Aided by Airey Neave&#x27;s campaigning among backbench MPs — whose earlier approach to William Whitelaw had been rebuffed, out of loyalty to Heath — she emerged as the only serious challenger.

The new rules permitted new candidates to enter the ballot in a second round of voting should the first be inconclusive, so Thatcher&#x27;s challenge was considered by some to be that of a stalking horse. Neave deliberately understated Thatcher&#x27;s support to attract wavering votes from MPs who were keen to see Heath replaced even though they did not necessarily want Thatcher to replace him.

On 4 February 1975, Thatcher defeated Heath in the first ballot by 130 votes to 119, with Fraser coming in a distant third with 16 votes. This was not a big enough margin to give Thatcher the 15% majority necessary to win on the first ballot, but having finished in second place Heath immediately resigned and did not contest the next ballot. His favoured candidate, William Whitelaw, lost to Thatcher in the second vote one week later (Thatcher 146, Whitelaw 79, Howe 19, Prior 19, Peyton 11). The vote polarised along right-left lines, with in addition the region, experience and education of the MP having their effects. Heath and Whitelaw were stronger on the left, among Oxbridge and public school graduates, and in MPs from Northern England or Scotland.

Thatcher had promised Heath a seat in the Shadow Cabinet and planned to offer him whatever post he wanted. His advisors agreed he should wait at least six months, so he declined. He never relented and his refusal was called &quot;the incredible sulk&quot;. Thatcher visited Heath at his home shortly after her election as leader and had to stay for coffee with his PPS Timothy Kitson so the waiting press would not realise how brief the visit had been. Heath claimed that he had simply declined her request for advice about how to handle the press, whilst Thatcher claimed that she offered him any Shadow Cabinet position he wanted and asked him to lead the Conservative campaign in the imminent EEC referendum, only to be rudely rebuffed.

==Later career (1975–2001)==

For many years, Heath persisted in criticism of the party&#x27;s new ideological direction. At the time of his defeat, he was still popular with rank-and-file Conservative members and was warmly applauded at the 1975 Conservative Party Conference. He played a leading role in the 1975 referendum campaign in which the UK voted to remain part of the EEC, and he remained active on the international stage, serving on the Brandt Commission investigation into developmental issues, particularly on North–South projects (Brandt Report).

His relations with Thatcher remained poor, and in 1979–80, he turned down her offers of the positions of Ambassador to the United States and Secretary General of NATO. He continued as a central figure on the left of the party and, at the 1981 Conservative Party conference, openly criticised the government&#x27;s economic policy of monetarism, which had seen inflation rise from 13% in 1979 to 18% in 1980 then fall to 4% by 1983, but had seen unemployment double from around 1.5 million to a postwar high of 3.3 million during that time.

In 1990, he flew to Baghdad to attempt to negotiate the release of aircraft passengers on British Airways Flight 149 and other British nationals taken hostage when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. After the events of Black Wednesday in 1992, he stated in the House of Commons that government should build a fund of reserves to counter currency speculators.

In 1987, he was nominated in the election for the Chancellorship of the University of Oxford but lost to Roy Jenkins as a result of splitting the Conservative vote with Lord Blake.
Heath continued to serve as a backbench MP for the London constituency of Old Bexley and Sidcup and was, from 1992, the longest-serving MP (&quot;Father of the House&quot;) and the oldest British MP. As Father of the House, he oversaw the election of two Speakers of the Commons, Betty Boothroyd and Michael Martin. Heath was created a Knight Companion of the Garter on 23 April 1992. He retired from Parliament at the 2001 general election. Heath and Tony Benn were the last two serving MPs to have been elected during the reign of George VI, with Heath serving continuously since 1950.

Heath maintained business links with several companies including a Saudi think tank, two investment funds and a Chinese freight operator, mainly as an adviser on China or a member of the governing board. According to Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong, his commercial interests in China could have been one of the reasons why he denounced the democratic reforms introduced in the run-up to the handover of Hong Kong.

Parliament broke with precedent by commissioning a bust of Heath while he was still alive. Commentators have noted how the statue of Margaret Thatcher appears to overshadow Heath&#x27;s bust. The 1993 bronze work, by Martin Jennings, was moved to the Members&#x27; Lobby in 2002. On 29 April 2002, in his eighty-sixth year, he made a public appearance at Downing Street alongside the then–prime minister Tony Blair and the three other surviving former prime ministers at the time (James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major), as well as relatives of deceased prime ministers, for a dinner which was part of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II. This was to be one of his last public appearances, as the following year saw a decline in his health.

==Personal life==
===Private residence===
In the 1960s, Heath had lived in Albany, off Piccadilly; at the unexpected end of his premiership, the French couple living there refused his demand that they move out so that he could have his flat back (&quot;So much for European Unity!&quot; Heath later wrote in his memoirs). For four months, Heath took the flat of Conservative MP Timothy Kitson; Kitson declined his offer to pay rent but later recalled an occasion when his own watch broke, and Heath in response invited him to take one of a large collection that he had been given on his travels. In July 1974, the Duke of Westminster, a major London landowner and ardent Europhile, allowed Heath to rent a property in Wilton Street, Belgravia, for an annual rent of £1,250 (£ at 2025 prices), a tenth of the market value. The house had three storeys and a basement flat for Heath&#x27;s housekeeper, and he continued to use it as his London home until old age prevented him from climbing the stairs.

In February 1985, Heath acquired a Wiltshire home, Arundells, in the Cathedral close at Salisbury, where he resided until his death twenty years later. In January 2006, it was announced that Heath had placed his house and contents, valued at £5 million in his will, in a charitable foundation, the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, to conserve the house as a museum to his career. The house is open to the public for guided tours from March to October; displayed therein is a large collection of personal effects as well as Heath&#x27;s personal library, photo collections, and paintings by Winston Churchill.

In his will, Heath, who had no descendants, left only two legacies: £20,000 to his brother&#x27;s widow, and £2,500 to his housekeeper.

===Yachting===
Heath was a keen yachtsman. He bought his first yacht &quot;Morning Cloud&quot; in 1969 and won the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race that year. He captained Britain&#x27;s winning team for the Admiral&#x27;s Cup in 1971 – while prime minister – and also captained the team in the 1979 Fastnet race. He was a member of the Broadstairs Sailing Club, where he learnt to sail on a Snipe and a Fireball before moving on to success in larger boats.

===Classical music===
Heath maintained an interest in classical music as a pianist, organist and orchestral conductor, famously installing a Steinway grand in 10 Downing Street – bought with his £450 Charlemagne Prize money, awarded for his unsuccessful efforts to bring Britain into the EEC in 1963, and chosen on the advice of his friend, the pianist Moura Lympany – and conducting Christmas carol concerts in Broadstairs every year from his teens until old age.

Heath conducted the London Symphony Orchestra, notably at a gala concert at the Royal Festival Hall in November 1971, at which he conducted Sir Edward Elgar&#x27;s overture &quot;Cockaigne (In London Town)&quot;. He also conducted the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra, as well as orchestras in Germany and the United States. During his premiership, Heath invited musician friends, such as Isaac Stern, Yehudi Menuhin, Clifford Curzon and the Amadeus Quartet, to perform either at Chequers or 10 Downing Street. Heath was the founding President of the European Community Youth Orchestra (in 1976), now the European Union Youth Orchestra.

In 1988, Heath recorded Beethoven&#x27;s Triple Concerto, Op. 56 (with members of the Trio Zingara as soloists) and Boccherini&#x27;s Cello Concerto in G major, G480.

===Football===
Heath was a supporter of the Lancashire football club Burnley, and just after the end of his term as prime minister in 1974 he opened the £450,000 Bob Lord Stand at the club&#x27;s Turf Moor stadium.

===Author===

Heath wrote several books in the second half of the 1970s: &quot;Sailing&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, and &quot;Travels&quot;. He also compiled a collection of carols called &quot;The Joy of Christmas&quot;, published in 1978 by Oxford University Press, which contained the music and lyrics to a wide variety of Christmas carols, each accompanied by a reproduction of a piece of religious art and a short introduction by Heath.

Heath&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Course of My Life&quot;, appeared in 1998. According to his obituary in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, this &quot;had involved dozens of researchers and writers (some of whom he never paid) over many years&quot;.

===&quot;Grocer Heath&quot;===
In 1964, despite substantial opposition from many Conservative MPs and independent grocers and shopkeepers, Heath led a successful fight to abolish resale price maintenance.

&quot;Private Eye&quot;, a satirical current affairs magazine, thereupon persistently ridiculed him as &quot;Grocer Heath&quot;. The magazine also parodied him as the managing director of a struggling small company, &quot;Heathco&quot;.

===Sexuality===
Heath never married. He had been expected to marry childhood friend Kay Raven, who was reportedly tired of waiting and married an RAF officer whom she met on holiday in 1950. In a four-sentence paragraph of his memoirs, Heath claimed that he had been too busy establishing a career after the war and had &quot;perhaps ... taken too much for granted&quot;. In a 1998 TV interview with Michael Cockerell, Heath said that he had kept her photograph in his flat for many years afterwards.

His interest in music kept him on friendly terms with female musicians, including pianist Moura Lympany. When Heath was prime minister she was approached by the Conservative MP Tufton Beamish, who said: &quot;Moura, Ted must get married. Will you marry him?&quot; She said she would have done but was in love with someone else. She later said the most intimate thing Heath had done was to put his arm around her shoulder.

Bernard Levin wrote at the time in &quot;The Observer&quot; that the UK had to wait until the emergence of the permissive society for a prime minister who was a virgin. In later life, according to his official biographer Philip Ziegler, at dinner parties Heath was &quot;apt to relapse into morose silence or completely ignore the woman next to him and talk across her to the nearest man&quot;; others at the time claimed Heath was just not talkative at parties.

There were many innuendos in &quot;Private Eye&quot; about it and chants insinuating he was homosexual could be heard outside Downing Street during protests by trade unionists against his Industrial Relations Bill.

John Campbell, who published a biography of Heath in 1993, devoted four pages to a discussion of the evidence concerning Heath&#x27;s sexuality. While acknowledging that Heath was often assumed by the public to be gay, not least because it is &quot;nowadays ... whispered of any bachelor&quot;, he found &quot;no positive evidence&quot; that this was so &quot;except for the faintest unsubstantiated rumour&quot; (the footnote refers to a mention of a &quot;disturbing incident&quot; at the beginning of the Second World War in a 1972 biography by Andrew Roth). Campbell ultimately concluded that the most significant aspect of Heath&#x27;s sexuality was his complete repression of it.

Brian Coleman, the Conservative Party London Assembly member for Barnet and Camden, claimed in 2007 that Heath, to protect his career, had stopped cottaging in the 1950s. Coleman said it was &quot;common knowledge&quot; among Conservatives that Heath had been given a stern warning by police when he underwent background checks for the post of privy counsellor. Heath&#x27;s biographer Philip Ziegler wrote in 2010 that Coleman was able to provide &quot;little or no information&quot; to back up this statement, that no man had ever claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Heath, nor was any trace of homosexuality to be found in his papers, and that &quot;those who knew him well&quot; insist that he had no such inclination. He believes Heath to have been asexual, although he does mention a letter from one &quot;Freddy&quot;, who seems hurt that &quot;Teddie&quot; had spurned his advances (chapter 2 of his book).

Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, who was Heath&#x27;s friend and former private secretary, stated his belief that Heath was asexual, saying that he &quot;never detected a whiff of sexuality in relation to men, women or children.&quot; Another friend and confidant, Sara Morrison, former vice-chairman of the Conservative Party, said Heath had &quot;effectively&quot; told her &quot;that he was sexless&quot;. Charles Moore, in his authorised biography of Margaret Thatcher, said that Bill Deedes believed that Thatcher &quot;seem[ed] convinced&quot; Heath was gay, whilst Moore believed it is &quot;possible&quot; that Thatcher&#x27;s reference, in interview in 1974, to Heath not having a family, was a deliberate hint that he was gay, in order to discredit him. Thatcher certainly seems to have disliked Heath. &quot;When I look at him and he looks at me,&quot; she once remarked, according to Ziegler (Chapter 4), &quot;it doesn&#x27;t feel like a man looking at a woman, more like a woman looking at another woman.&quot;

When he moved to Arundells in 1985, Heath hired Derek Frost, life partner of Jeremy Norman, to modernise and redecorate the house in Salisbury. He became friends with the couple, though never close. When they asked Heath why he had not supported homosexual law reform (he was either absent from the debates in the 1960s or voted against Lord Arran&#x27;s first Bill in May 1965), he replied that he had always been in favour but that &quot;the rank and file of the party would never have stood for it.&quot; Norman&#x27;s view is that Heath was &quot;a deeply closeted gay man&quot; who &quot;decided early in life to sublimate his sexuality to his political ambitions.&quot; In later life, Heath voted for the lowering of the age of same-sex consent to eighteen and then sixteen.

Similarly, Michael McManus, who was Heath&#x27;s private secretary in the 1990s and helped with his memoirs, writes in his book on gay conservative politicians that he &quot;was left in no doubt whatsoever that Heath was a gay man who had sacrificed his personal life to his political career, exercising iron self-control and living a celibate existence as he climbed the &#x27;greasy pole&#x27; of preferment.&quot;

===Allegations of child sexual abuse===

In April 2015, a rape claim against Heath was investigated by the Metropolitan Police but was dropped. In August 2015, several police forces were investigating allegations of child sexual abuse by Heath. Hampshire, Jersey, Kent, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Thames Valley constabularies and London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police investigated such claims. It was reported that a man had claimed that at the age of 12 years he had been raped by Heath in a Mayfair flat in 1961, after he had run away from home. Allegations about Heath were investigated as part of Operation Midland, the Metropolitan Police inquiry into claims of historic child abuse and related homicides. A witness called &quot;Nick&quot; was introduced to the police by the former &quot;Exaro&quot; website, who had asked him about alleged child sexual abuse by prominent figures at the Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico, London; Heath was reported to be one of the figures. In 2018 &quot;Nick&quot;, whose real name is Carl Beech, was arrested and charged over child pornography offences and in January 2019 he pleaded guilty. Beech, who had fabricated allegations against Heath and other prominent politicians and civil servants, was sentenced in July 2019 to eighteen years in prison.

Also in August 2015, Sky News reported that Jersey police were investigating allegations against Heath as part of Operation Whistle, and a similar investigation, Operation Conifer, was launched by Wiltshire Police at the same time. The Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, which operates the museum at Arundells, his home in Salisbury, said it welcomed the investigation. In November 2016, criminologist Richard Hoskins said that the evidence used against Heath in Operation Conifer, including discredited allegations of satanic ritual abuse, was &quot;preposterous&quot;, &quot;fantastical&quot; and gained through the &quot;controversial&quot; practice of recovered-memory therapy. Operation Conifer was closed in March 2017, having cost a reported £1.5 million over two years, as no corroborating evidence had been found in any of the 42 allegations by 40 individuals (including three different names used by one person).

In September 2017, it was announced that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse would review the police investigation into Heath. Police said that if Heath were still alive they would have interviewed him under caution in relation to seven out of the 42 allegations, but nothing should be inferred about his guilt or innocence. In his summary report, Chief Constable Mike Veale confirmed that &quot;no further corroborative evidence was found&quot; to support the satanic abuse claims.

==Illness and death==

In August 2003, at the age of 87, Heath suffered a pulmonary embolism while on holiday in Salzburg, Austria. He never fully recovered, and owing to his declining health and mobility made very few public appearances in the last two years of his life. His last appearance was at the unveiling of a set of gates at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral dedicated to Churchill on 30 November 2004.

In his final public statement, Heath paid tribute to James Callaghan, who died on 26 March 2005, saying &quot;James Callaghan was a major fixture in the political life of this country during his long and varied career. When in opposition he never hesitated to put firmly his party&#x27;s case. When in office he took a smoother approach towards his supporters and opponents alike. Although he left the House of Commons in 1987 he continued to follow political life and it was always a pleasure to meet with him. We have lost a major figure from our political landscape.&quot;

Just under four months later, Sir Edward Heath died at his home from pneumonia at 7.30 pm on 17 July 2005, at the age of 89, the day after his spokesman said he was &#x27;nearing the end of his life&#x27;. He was cremated on 25 July 2005 at a funeral service attended by 1,500 people. On the day after his death, the BBC Parliament channel showed the BBC results coverage of the 1970 election. A memorial service was held for Heath in Westminster Abbey on 8 November 2005, which was attended by 2,000 people. Three days later his ashes were interred in Salisbury Cathedral. In a tribute to him, the then-prime minister Tony Blair stated &quot;He was a man of great integrity and beliefs he held firmly from which he never wavered&quot;.
