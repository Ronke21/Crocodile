<text>Antonio Stradivari (, , ; – 18 December 1737) was an Italian luthier and a craftsman of string instruments such as violins, cellos, guitars, violas and harps. The Latinized form of his surname, &quot;Stradivarius&quot;, as well as the colloquial &quot;Strad&quot; are terms often used to refer to his instruments. It is estimated that Stradivari produced 1,116 instruments, of which 960 were violins. Around 650 instruments survive, including 450 to 512 violins. His instruments are considered some of the finest ever made, and are extremely valuable collector&#x27;s items.

== Biography ==

=== Family and early life ===
Antonio Stradivari&#x27;s birthdate, presumably between 1644 and 1649, has been debated amongst historians due to the numerous inconsistencies in the evidence of the latter. The 1668 and 1678 censuses report him actually growing younger, a fact explained by the probable loss of statistics from 1647 to 1649, when renewed belligerency between France&#x27;s Modenese and Spain&#x27;s Milanese proxies led to a flow of refugees that included Stradivari&#x27;s mother.

Stradivari&#x27;s ancestry consisted of notable citizens of Cremona, dating back to at least the 12th or 13th century. The earliest mention of the family name, or a variation upon it, is in a land grant dating from 1188. The origin of the name itself has several possible explanations; some sources say it is the plural of &quot;stradivare&quot;, essentially meaning &quot;toll-man&quot; in Lombard, while others say that the form &quot;de Strataverta&quot; derives from , which in Cremonese dialect means &quot;open road&quot;.

Antonio&#x27;s parents were Alessandro Stradivari, son of Giulio Cesare Stradivari, and Anna Moroni, daughter of Leonardo Moroni. They married on 30 August 1622, and had at least three children between 1623 and 1628: Giuseppe Giulio Cesare, Carlo Felice, and Giovanni Battista. The baptismal records of the parish of S. Prospero then stop, and it is unknown whether they had any children from 1628 to 1644. This gap in the records may be due to the family leaving Cremona in response to war, famine, and plague in the city from 1628 to 1630, or the records may have been lost due to clerical reforms imposed by Joseph II of Austria in 1788. The latter explanation is supported by the word &quot;Cremonensis&quot; (of Cremona) on many of Stradivari&#x27;s labels, which suggests that he was born in the city instead of merely moving back there to work. Antonio was born in 1644, a fact deducible from later violins. However, there are no records or information available on his early childhood, and the first evidence of his presence in Cremona is the label of his oldest surviving violin from 1666.

Stradivari likely began an apprenticeship with Nicola Amati between the ages of 12 and 14, although a minor debate surrounds this fact. One of the few pieces of evidence supporting this is the label of his 1666 violin, which reads, &quot;Alumnus Nicolai Amati, faciebat anno 1666&quot;. However, Stradivari did not repeatedly put Amati&#x27;s name on his labels, unlike many of Amati&#x27;s other students. Stradivari&#x27;s early violins actually bear less resemblance to Amati&#x27;s than his later instruments do. M. Chanot-Chardon, a well-known French luthier, asserted that his father had a label of Stradivari&#x27;s stating, &quot;Made at the age of thirteen, in the workshop of Nicolò Amati&quot;. This label has never been found or confirmed. Amati would also have been a logical choice for Antonio&#x27;s parents, as he represented an old family of violin makers in Cremona, and was far superior to most other luthiers in Italy.

Some researchers believe there is a closer educational association between Antonio Stradivari and Francesco Rugeri than has previously been recognized. Despite the long-held belief that Antonio Stradivari was the pupil of Nicolò Amati, there are important discrepancies between their work. Some researchers believe early instruments by Stradivari bear a stronger resemblance to Francesco Rugeri&#x27;s work than Amati&#x27;s. Additionally, the utilization of a small dorsal pin or small hole, invariably used not just by Nicolò Amati but all of his recognized pupils — but not used by Antonio Stradivari — adds further evidence that Stradivari may not have learnt his craft from Amati. This pin or hole was fundamental in the graduation of the thickness of the plates and was a technique passed on through generations of pupils of the Amati. This dorsal pin is also not found in any of the instruments of the Rugeri family, suggesting Antonio Stradivari may have actually learnt his craft from Francesco Rugeri, both of them having been influenced by Amati. W.E. Hill &amp; Sons concede that they fail to find the hand of Stradivari in any of Nicola Amati&#x27;s work, although the unmistakable hands of Andrea Guarneri and Francesco Rugeri are evident.

An alternative theory is that Stradivari started out as a woodworker: the house he lived in from 1667 to 1680 was owned by Francesco Pescaroli, a woodcarver and inlayer. Stradivari may even have been employed to decorate some of Amati&#x27;s instruments, without being a true apprentice. This theory is supported by some of Stradivari&#x27;s later violins, which have elaborate decorations and purfling.

Assuming that Stradivari was a student of Amati, he would have begun his apprenticeship in 1656–58 and produced his first decent instruments in 1660, at the age of 16. His first labels were printed from 1660 to 1665, which indicates that his work had sufficient quality to be offered directly to his patrons. However, he probably stayed in Amati&#x27;s workshop until about 1684, using his master&#x27;s reputation as a launching point for his career.

=== First marriage ===

Stradivari married his first wife, Francesca Ferraboschi, on 4 July 1667. A clue to how they would have met lies in the 1659 Easter census, which lists the Ferraboschi family four houses away from the Amati residence. Francesca was the young widow of the Giacomo Capra, with whom she had two children. Francesca&#x27;s brother had shot Giacomo with a crossbow on the Piazza Garibaldi (formerly the Piazza Santa Agata) in 1664. He was later exiled, though allowed to return to Cremona many years later. After their marriage, Stradivari moved into a house known as the Casa del Pescatore, or the Casa Nuziale, in his wife&#x27;s parish. The couple had a daughter, Giulia Maria, three to four months later. They remained in the house until 1680, during which time they had five more children, starting with an infant son who lived for only a week, and then Francesco, Catterina, Alessandro, and Omobono Stradivari.

Stradivari purchased a house now known as No. 1 Piazza Roma (formerly No. 2 Piazza San Domenico) around 1680 for the sum of 7000 lire, 2000 of which he paid at the time of the purchase. The totality of the house was paid for by 1684. The residence was just doors away from those of several other violin-making families of Cremona, including the Amatis and Guarneris. Stradivari probably worked in the loft and attic, and he stayed in this house for the rest of his life.

Stradivari&#x27;s wife Francesca died on 20 May 1698, and received an elaborate funeral five days later.

=== Second marriage ===
Stradivari married his second wife, Antonia Maria Zambelli, on 24 August 1699. She was 35 at the time of the marriage. They had five children from 1700 to 1708—Francesca Maria, Giovanni Battista Giuseppe, Giovanni Battista Martino, Giuseppe Antonio, and Paolo.
=== Death ===
Stradivari died in Cremona on 18 December 1737, aged 93, after roughly 75 years of crafting instruments. He is buried in the Church of San Domenico. The tomb was acquired eight years prior to his death, having been bought from a Cremonese family, substituting his name for theirs in the tombstone.

=== Will ===
Stradivari generated substantial wealth in his lifetime. His will, dated 1729, counted eight living heirs, including his wife. Zambelli was left with her clothing, bed linens, household items, and half of her jewelry. Antonia would become the responsibility of his two eldest sons. Annunciata Caterina was left her jewelry, clothing, linens, and income on loans. Paolo, the youngest child, would get six finished violins—valued at 1,000 lire—as well as some household effects and cash. Three other children who had joined religious orders were left with their share of inheritance: Maria, a nun, would get an annuity; Alessandro, a priest, would get fixed income on a home mortgage loan; and Giuseppe, another priest, would get some income on half a share from a pastry shop. There were also annual payments to his two sons of 150 and 300 lire each and 170 lire for Annunciata and 100 for Francesca.

His remaining two sons from his first marriage had both worked in the family shop. Omobono, who had left the dwelling aged eighteen in search of new employment possibilities in Naples, would inherit six violins, and Francesco, who was named his father&#x27;s successor, would inherit the rest of the estate, including all of the tools, stencils, finished violins, patterns, and—ostensibly—his father&#x27;s reputation. In 1733, he had bought his youngest son a partnership in a local textile firm for the large amount of 25,000 lire.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Stradivari probably developed his own style slowly. Some of his early violins were smaller, with notable exception to this is the 1679 &quot;Hellier&quot; violin, which had much larger proportions. Stradivari&#x27;s early (pre-1684) violins are in strong contrast to Amati&#x27;s instruments from the same time period; Stradivari&#x27;s have a stronger build; less rounded curves, with the purfling set farther in.

By 1680, Stradivari had acquired at least a small, yet growing, reputation. In 1682, a Venetian banker ordered a complete set of instruments, which he planned to present to King James II of England. The fate of these instruments is unknown. Cosimo III de&#x27; Medici bought another five years later. Amati died in 1684, an event followed by a noticeable increase in Stradivari&#x27;s production. The years 1684 and 1685 also marked an important development in his style—the dimensions he used generally increased, and his instruments were more in the style of Amati&#x27;s work of the 1640s and 1650s. Stradivari&#x27;s instruments underwent no major change in the next five years, although in 1688 he began cutting a more distinct bevel and began outlining the heads of instruments in black, a quite original improvement.

Stradivari&#x27;s relatively early success in his career may have allowed him to use a more experimental approach to violin building. In fact, Stradivari&#x27;s early career is marked by wide experimentation, and his instruments during this period are generally considered of a lesser quality than his later work. However, the precision with which he carved the heads and inserted the purfling quickly marked him as one of the most dextrous craftsmen in the world, a prime example of this being the 1690 &quot;Tuscan&quot; violin. Pre-1690 instruments are sometimes termed &quot;Amatisé&quot; but this is not completely accurate; it is largely because Stradivari created many more instruments later on that people try to connect his early work with Amati&#x27;s style.

By 1680 Stradivari moved to No. 1 Piazza Roma (formerly No. 2 Piazza San Domenico). The house was just doors away from those of several other violin-making families of Cremona, including the Amatis and Guarneris. Stradivari probably worked in the loft and attic, and he lived in this house for the rest of his life.

=== &quot;Golden&quot; period and later years ===
In the early 1690s, Stradivari made a pronounced departure from this earlier style of instrument-making, changing two key elements of his instruments. First, he began to make violins with a larger pattern than previous instruments; these larger violins usually are known as &quot;Long Strads&quot;. He also switched to using a darker, richer varnish, as opposed to a yellower varnish similar to that used by Amati. He continued to use this pattern until 1698, with few exceptions. Between 1698 and 1700, he abandoned the Long Strad model and returned to a slightly shorter model, which he used until his death. The period from 1700 to 1725 is often termed the &quot;Golden Period&quot; of his production. Instruments made during this time are usually considered of a higher quality than his earlier instruments. These instruments also fetch much higher prices than his other instruments and are especially prized by collectors. Late-period instruments made from the late 1720s until his death in 1737 show signs of Stradivari&#x27;s advancing age. These late instruments may be a bit less beautiful than the Golden Period instruments, but many nonetheless possess a fine tone. Heavier and looser craftsmanship of the late Stradivari output can be seen in the 1734 &#x27;Habeneck&#x27;.

== Stradivari and the Cremonese violin making school ==
=== Influence in the 18th century ===
The Stradivari parish, San Matteo, and the Amati parish, San Faustino, comprised the center of Cremonese violin making. They exerted influence on one another&#x27;s shape, varnish and sound of instruments, but also on many of their contemporaries&#x27;; they defined violin making standards for the next 300 years.

Even at the beginning of the 18th century, Stradivari&#x27;s influence could be seen not only in the work of Cremonese makers, but also international ones, such as Barak Norman&#x27;s, one of the first important British makers. In the 1720s Daniel Parker, a very important British luthier, produced fine violins after Stradivari&#x27;s work selling anywhere from £30,000 to £60,000 in recent auctions. Parker based his best instruments on Stradivari&#x27;s &quot;long pattern&quot;, having the opportunity to study one or more of the instruments. Well into the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume, the leading French luthier of his time, also made many important copies of Strads and Guarneris.

In the 18th century, Cremonese luthiers were the suppliers and local players on the demand side. After Stradivari&#x27;s death, this drastically changed. Although the Cremonese luthiers remained the suppliers, the demand side now consisted mainly of collectors, researchers, imitators, profiteers, and speculators. Many local players could no longer afford the sought-out instruments and most of the purchased instruments would be hidden in private collections, put in museums, or simply put back in their cases, hoping that they would gain value over time. This is when the Stradivari &quot;fever&quot; really took off. The violin collector Count Ignazio Alessandro Cozio di Salabue, Vuillaume, and later Tarisio Auctions have all contributed to this frenzy that would extend well into the 21st century. Also, most of the other major Cremonese luthiers died soon after Stradivari, putting an end to the golden period of Cremona&#x27;s violin making, which lasted more than 150 years, starting with the Amatis and ending with the Cerutis.

The Cremonese maker Vincenzo Rugeri (1663–1719), while staying true to the Grand Amati Pattern by Nicolo Amati, was influenced by Stradivari in that he adopted a somewhat lower arch consistent with Stradivarian ideals.

Members of the Gagliano family such as Gennaro and Nicolo made excellent copies of the instruments in the 1740s, though the only similarity to Stradivari&#x27;s instruments was the execution of the form and arching as well as consistently fine and detailed varnish. Nicolo would usually use the &quot;forma&quot; B model for his cellos and as the quality of the output steadily declined within the family, the Stradivari models were almost abandoned in Naples.

Having acquired many Strads from Paolo Stradivari, Count Cozio commissioned Giovanni Battista Guadagnini to make some replicas of the instruments. Although many features of Strads are present in the copies, they still remain heavily influenced by Guadagnini&#x27;s workshop principles and represent well the maker&#x27;s Turin period.

Vincenzo Panormo was also one of the many luthiers who based many of his violins on Strads. He learned about them in Paris between 1779 and 1789 when he worked closely with Léopold Renaudin, another one of Strad&#x27;s followers. Stradivari&#x27;s influence could also be seen in Spain with the outstanding work of José Contreras of Granada and Madrid. Having the privilege to be exposed to Stradivari&#x27;s instruments through the Spanish court, he was experienced enough to replace the scroll of a 1717 Stradivari cello and possibly even make its back and ribs. He had a great ability to imitate the original varnish and intricacy of the instrument.

=== Influence in the 19th and 20th century ===
The 19th century was not as eventful in comparison to the previous centuries. Some of the most important luthiers from this part of history include Giovanni Rota, as well as the two non-Italian makers François Chanot in France and the artist, inventor and musician William Sidney Mount in the US, who both created experimental violins.

The 20th century was the so-called rebirth of Cremonese making, when luthiers such as Giuseppe Antonio Rocca, Giovanni Battista Morassi, Beltrami, and the Antoniazzi family emerged from a seemingly uneventful and experimental period. These makers, sometimes basing their early violins on Strads, would later on make their own models and would inspire each other&#x27;s work.
=== Stradivari and his sons ===
Even though Antonio had a very long working life, it is impossible for him to have crafted more than 1,000 instruments entirely by himself, meaning that his sons, Francesco and Omobono, as well as possibly a third son, must have been working on and off in his shop. It is known that having left the workshop at eighteen, Omobono made a few instruments on his own, such as the &#x27;Blagrove&#x27; and another violin dating from 1732. On his side, Francesco made very few violins independently, such as the 1742 &#x27;Salabue&#x27; and &#x27;Oliveira&#x27;, spending his lifetime in his father&#x27;s shop. This was one of the main reasons that Francesco had a large part in Antonio&#x27;s will, and Omobono a lesser one. One of the major differences between Antonio and his sons&#x27; craftsmanship was the quality of the purfling on their instruments, which in the case of Francesco and Omobono has been referred to as &quot;startlingly poor&quot;.

&quot;Only a handful of instruments are reliably attributed to Francesco alone. ... [There are only] two authentic labels known: &#x27;Franciscus Stradivarius Cremonensis / Filius Antonii faciebat Anno 1742&#x27; ... Notably it omits the A+S stamp that occurs on Antonio&#x27;s labels. Another label states &#x27;Sotto la Disciplina d&#x27;Antonio / Stradivari F. in Cremona 1737&#x27;. This is of course the year of his father&#x27;s death, and the phrase &#x27;sotto la disciplina&#x27; (&#x27;under the discipline&#x27;), although it appears in a few other instruments, may here be a particular sign of his respect.&quot;

== Stradivarius instruments ==

The Hills Violin Shop estimates that Stradivari produced 1,116 instruments, of which 960 were violins. It is also estimated that around 650 of these instruments survive, including 450 to 512 violins.

Stradivari&#x27;s instruments are regarded as amongst the finest bowed stringed instruments ever created, are highly prized, and are still played by professionals today. His violins are desired more than those of any other luthier except his contemporary, Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesù, who commands a similar respect among violinists. However, neither blind listening tests nor acoustic analysis have ever demonstrated that Stradivarius instruments are better than other high-quality instruments or even reliably distinguishable from them.

While the usual label for a Stradivarius instrument, whether genuine or false, uses the traditional Latin inscription, after the McKinley Tariff Act of 1890, copies were also inscribed with the country of origin. Since thousands of instruments are based on Stradivari&#x27;s models and bear the same name as his models, many unwary people are deceived into purchasing forged Stradivarius instruments, which can be avoided by authenticating the instrument.

Some violinists and cellists use Stradivari instruments in their work. Yo-Yo Ma uses the &quot;Davidov Stradivarius&quot;, Julian Lloyd Webber employs the &quot;Barjansky Stradivarius&quot;, and, until his death in 2007, Mstislav Rostropovich played on the &quot;Duport Stradivarius&quot;. The &quot;Soil&quot; of 1714 is owned by virtuoso Itzhak Perlman. The &quot;Countess Polignac&quot; is currently played by Gil Shaham. The Vienna Philharmonic uses several Stradivari instruments that were purchased by Austria&#x27;s central bank Österreichische Nationalbank and other sponsors: &quot;Chaconne&quot;, 1725; &quot;ex-Hämmerle&quot;, 1709; &quot;ex-Smith-Quersin&quot;, 1714; &quot;ex-Arnold Rosé&quot;, &quot;ex-Viotti&quot;, 1718; and &quot;ex-Halphen&quot;, 1727. Viktoria Mullova owns and plays the &quot;Jules Falk&quot;. Joshua Bell owns and plays the Gibson ex-Huberman.

The London sales of &quot;The Mendelssohn&quot; at £902,000 ($1,776,940) in 1990 and &quot;The Kreutzer&quot; for £947,500 in 1998 constitute two top-selling Stradivari. A record price paid at a public auction for a Stradivari was $2,032,000 for the &quot;Lady Tennant&quot; at Christie&#x27;s in New York, April 2005. On 16 May 2006, Christie&#x27;s auctioned Stradivari&#x27;s 1707 &quot;Hammer&quot; for a new record of US$3,544,000. On 2 April 2007, Christie&#x27;s sold a Stradivari violin, the 1729 &quot;Solomon, Ex-Lambert&quot;, for more than $2.7 million to an anonymous bidder in the auction house&#x27;s fine musical instruments sale. Its price, US$2,728,000 including Christie&#x27;s commission, far outdid its estimated value: $1 million to $1.5 million. On 14 October 2010, a 1697 Stradivari violin known as &quot;The Molitor&quot; was sold online by Tarisio Auctions for a world-record price of $3,600,000 to violinist Anne Akiko Meyers: at the time its price was the highest for any musical instrument sold at auction. On 21 June 2011, the Lady Blunt Stradivarius, a 1721 violin, was auctioned by Tarisio to an anonymous bidder for almost £10 million, with all proceeds going to help the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. This was over four times the previous auction record for a Stradivari violin. The Baron von der Leyen Strad was auctioned by Tarisio on 26 April 2012, for $2.6 million.

Publicly displayed collections of Stradivari instruments are those of:

*the Library of Congress with three violins, a viola, and a cello
*the Spanish royal collection with five instruments (an undecorated cello plus a quartet of decorated instruments: two violins, the &quot;Spanish I and II&quot;, the &quot;Spanish Court&quot; cello, and the &quot;Spanish Court&quot; viola) exhibited at the Royal Palace of Madrid (&quot;Palacio Real de Madrid&quot;) 
*London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Music (Royal Academy of Music Museum) with several instruments by Antonio Stradivari, including the &quot;Joachim&quot; (1698), &quot;Rutson&quot; (1694), the &quot;Crespi&quot; (1699), &quot;Viotti ex-Bruce&quot; (1709), &quot;Kustendyke&quot; (1699), &quot;Maurin&quot; (1718) and the &quot;Ex Back&quot; (1666) violins, &quot;Ex Kux&quot; (1714), and the &quot;Archinto&quot; (1696) violas, the &quot;Marquis de Corberon&quot; (1726) and the &quot;Markevitch&quot; (1709) celli. 
*the Musée de la musique in Paris displays several beautiful Stradivari instruments that formerly belonged to the Paris Conservatory.

The collection of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra had the largest number of Stradivari in its string section, purchased in 2003 from the collection of Herbert R. Axelrod, until it decided to sell them in 2007. A collection assembled by Rodman Wanamaker in the 1920s contained as many as 65 stringed instruments by such masters as Stradivari, Gofriller, Baptiste and Giuseppe Guarneri. Included was &quot;The Swan&quot;, the last violin made by Stradivari, and soloist instrument of the great Cuban 19th-century virtuoso Joseph White. The collection, known as The Cappella, was used in concerts with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Leopold Stokowski before being dispersed after Wanamaker&#x27;s death. The Vienna Philharmonic uses four violins and one cello. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has three Stradivari violins dated 1693, 1694 and 1717. The National Music Museum, in Vermillion, South Dakota, has in its collection one of two known Stradivari guitars, one of eleven known violas da gamba, later modified into a cello form, one of two known choral mandolins, and one of six Stradivari violins that still retain their original neck. In the interests of conservation, the &quot;Messiah Stradivarius&quot; violin—on display in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England—has not been played at all in recent years.

<doc id="56458" wikidata="Q498916" url="?curid=56458" title="Apraxia">
<text>Apraxia is a motor disorder caused by damage to the brain (specifically the posterior parietal cortex or corpus callosum), which causes difficulty with motor planning to perform tasks or movements. The nature of the damage determines the disorder&#x27;s severity, and the absence of sensory loss or paralysis helps to explain the level of difficulty. Children may be born with apraxia; its cause is unknown, and symptoms are usually noticed in the early stages of development. Apraxia occurring later in life, known as &quot;acquired apraxia&quot;, is typically caused by traumatic brain injury, stroke, dementia, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, brain tumor, or other neurodegenerative disorders. The multiple types of apraxia are categorized by the specific ability and/or body part affected.

The term &quot;apraxia&quot; comes .

==Types==
The several types of apraxia include:
* Apraxia of speech (AOS) is having difficulty planning and coordinating the movements necessary for speech (e.g. potato=totapo, topato). AOS can independently occur without issues in areas such as verbal comprehension, reading comprehension, writing, articulation, or prosody.
* Buccofacial or orofacial apraxia, the most common type of apraxia, is the inability to carry out facial movements on demand. For example, an inability to lick one&#x27;s lips, wink, or whistle when requested to do so. This suggests an inability to carry out volitional movements of the tongue, cheeks, lips, pharynx, or larynx on command.
* Constructional apraxia is the inability to draw, construct, or copy simple configurations, such as intersecting shapes. These patients have difficulty copying a simple diagram or drawing basic shapes.
* Gait apraxia is the loss of ability to have normal function of the lower limbs such as walking. This is not due to loss of motor or sensory functions.
* Ideational/conceptual apraxia is having an inability to conceptualize a task and impaired ability to complete multistep actions. This form of apraxia consists of an inability to select and carry out an appropriate motor program. For example, the patient may complete actions in incorrect orders, such as buttering bread before putting it in the toaster, or putting on shoes before putting on socks. Also, a loss occurs in the ability to voluntarily perform a learned task when given the necessary objects or tools. For instance, if given a screwdriver, these patients may try to write with it as if it were a pen, or try to comb their hair with a toothbrush.
* Ideomotor apraxia is having deficits in the ability to plan or complete motor actions that rely on semantic memory. These patients are able to explain how to perform an action, but unable to &quot;imagine&quot; or act out a movement such as &quot;pretend to brush your teeth&quot; or &quot;pucker as though you bit into a sour lemon.&quot; When the ability to perform an action automatically when cued remains intact, though, this is known as automatic-voluntary dissociation. For example, they may not be able to pick up a phone when asked to do so, but can perform the action without thinking when the phone rings.
* Limb-kinetic apraxia is having the inability to perform precise, voluntary movements of extremities. For example, a person affected by limb apraxia may have difficulty waving hello, tying shoes, or typing on a computer. This type is common in patients who have experienced a stroke, some type of brain trauma, or have Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.
* Oculomotor apraxia is having difficulty moving the eye on command, especially with saccade movements that direct the gaze to targets. This is one of the three major components of Balint&#x27;s syndrome.

==Causes==
Apraxia is most often due to a lesion located in the dominant (usually left) hemisphere of the brain, typically in the frontal and parietal lobes. Lesions may be due to stroke, acquired brain injuries, or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease or other dementias, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, or Huntington&#x27;s disease. Also, apraxia possibly may be caused by lesions in other areas of the brain.

Ideomotor apraxia is typically due to a decrease in blood flow to the dominant hemisphere of the brain and particularly the parietal and premotor areas. It is frequently seen in patients with corticobasal degeneration.

Ideational apraxia has been observed in patients with lesions in the dominant hemisphere near areas associated with aphasia, but more research is needed on ideational apraxia due to brain lesions. The localization of lesions in areas of the frontal and temporal lobes would provide explanation for the difficulty in motor planning seen in ideational apraxia, as well as its difficulty to distinguish it from certain aphasias.

Constructional apraxia is often caused by lesions of the inferior nondominant parietal lobe, and can be caused by brain injury, illness, tumor, or other condition that can result in a brain lesion.

==Diagnosis==
Although qualitative and quantitative studies exist, little consensus exists on the proper method to assess for apraxia. The criticisms of past methods include failure to meet standard psychometric properties and research-specific designs that translate poorly to nonresearch use.

The Test to Measure Upper Limb Apraxia (TULIA) is one method of determining upper limb apraxia through the qualitative and quantitative assessment of gesture production. In contrast to previous publications on apraxic assessment, the reliability and validity of TULIA was thoroughly investigated. The TULIA consists of subtests for the imitation and pantomime of nonsymbolic (&quot;put your index finger on top of your nose&quot;), intransitive (&quot;wave goodbye&quot;), and transitive (&quot;show me how to use a hammer&quot;) gestures. Discrimination (differentiating between well- and poorly performed tasks) and recognition (indicating which object corresponds to a pantomimed gesture) tasks are also often tested for a full apraxia evaluation.

However, a strong correlation may not be seen between formal test results and actual performance in everyday functioning or activities of daily living (ADLs). A comprehensive assessment of apraxia should include formal testing, standardized measurements of ADLs, observation of daily routines, self-report questionnaires, and targeted interviews with the patients and their relatives.

As stated above, apraxia should not be confused with aphasia (the inability to understand language); however, they frequently occur together. Apraxia is so often accompanied by aphasia that many believe that if a person displays AOS, then the patient also having some level of aphasia should be assumed.

==Treatment==
Treatment for individuals with apraxia includes speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Currently, no medications are indicated for the treatment of apraxia, only therapy treatments. Generally, treatments for apraxia have received little attention for several reasons, including the tendency for the condition to resolve spontaneously in acute cases. Additionally, the very nature of the automatic-voluntary dissociation of motor abilities that defines apraxia means that patients may still be able to automatically perform activities if cued to do so in daily life. Nevertheless, patients experiencing apraxia have less functional independence in their daily lives, and that evidence for the treatment of apraxia is scarce. However, a literature review of apraxia treatment to date reveals that although the field is in its early stages of treatment design, certain aspects can be included to treat apraxia.

One method is through rehabilitative treatment, which has been found to positively impact apraxia, as well as ADLs. In this review, rehabilitative treatment consisted of 12 different contextual cues, which were used to teach patients how to produce the same gesture under different contextual situations. Additional studies have also recommended varying forms of gesture therapy, whereby the patient is instructed to make gestures (either using objects or symbolically meaningful and nonmeaningful gestures) with progressively less cuing from the therapist. Patients with apraxia may need to use a form of alternative and augmentative communication depending on the severity of the disorder. In addition to using gestures as mentioned, patients can also use communication boards or more sophisticated electronic devices if needed.

No single type of therapy or approach has been proven as the best way to treat a patient with apraxia, since each patient&#x27;s case varies. One-on-one sessions usually work the best, though, with the support of family members and friends. Since everyone responds to therapy differently, some patients will make significant improvements, while others will make less progress. The overall goal for treatment of apraxia is to treat the motor plans for speech, not treating at the phoneme (sound) level. Individuals with apraxia of speech should receive treatment that focuses on the repetition of target words and rate of speech. The overall goal for treatment of apraxia should be to improve speech intelligibility, rate of speech, and articulation of targeted words.

<text>Canavan disease, or Canavan–Van Bogaert–Bertrand disease, is a rare and fatal autosomal recessive degenerative disease that causes progressive damage to nerve cells and loss of white matter in the brain. It is one of the most common degenerative cerebral diseases of infancy. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aminoacylase 2, and is one of a group of genetic diseases referred to as leukodystrophies. It is characterized by degeneration of myelin in the phospholipid layer insulating the axon of a neuron and is associated with a gene located on human chromosome 17.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of the most common (and most serious) form of Canavan disease typically appear in early infancy usually between the first three to six months of age. Canavan disease then progresses rapidly from that stage, with typical cases involving intellectual disability, loss of previously acquired motor skills, feeding difficulties, abnormal muscle tone (i.e., initial floppiness – hypotonia – that may eventually translate into spasticity), poor head control, and megalocephaly (abnormally enlarged head). Paralysis, blindness, or seizures may also occur.

There exists a much less common variant of Canavan disease which is generally much less serious and involves later onset of symptoms, which are often mild and nonspecific enough to go unrecognized as manifestations of Canavan&#x27;s disease. This variant does not seem to have any effect on lifespan and is typically limited to minor cases of speech and motor skill development delay.

==Pathophysiology==

Canavan disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. When both parents are carriers, the chance of having an affected child is 25%. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families with two parental carriers.

Canavan disease is caused by a defective &quot;ASPA&quot; gene which is responsible for the production of the enzyme aspartoacylase. Decreased aspartoacylase activity prevents the normal breakdown of &quot;N&quot;-acetylaspartate, wherein the accumulation of &quot;N&quot;-acetylaspartate, or lack of its further metabolism interferes with the growth of the myelin sheath of the nerve fibers of the brain. The myelin sheath is the fatty covering that surrounds nerve cells and acts as an insulator, allowing for efficient transmission of nerve impulses.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of neonatal/infantile Canavan disease relies on the demonstration of a very high concentration of &quot;N&quot;-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the urine. In mild/juvenile Canavan disease, NAA may only be slightly elevated; thus, the diagnosis relies on molecular genetic testing of &quot;ASPA&quot;, the gene encoding the enzyme aspartoacylase.

==Treatment==
No cure for Canavan disease is known, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Physical therapy may help improve motor skills, and educational programs may help improve communication skills. Seizures are treated with antiepileptic drugs and gastrostomy is used to help maintain adequate food intake and hydration when swallowing difficulties exist. Also, an experimental treatment uses lithium citrate. When a person has Canavan disease, their levels of &quot;N&quot;-acetylaspartate are chronically elevated. The lithium citrate was proven in a rat genetic model of Canavan disease to decrease levels of &quot;N&quot;-acetyl aspartate significantly. When tested on a human, the subject&#x27;s condition reversed during a two-week wash-out period after withdrawal of lithium.

The investigation revealed both decreased &quot;N&quot;-acetylaspartate levels in regions of the brain tested and magnetic resonance spectroscopic values that are more characteristic of normal development and myelination. This evidence suggests that a larger controlled trial of lithium may be warranted as supportive therapy for children with Canavan disease.

Experimental gene therapy trial results, published in 2002, used a healthy gene to take over for the defective one that causes Canavan disease.

In human trials, the results of which were published in 2012, this method appeared to improve the patient&#x27;s life without long-term adverse effects during a five-year follow-up.

==Prognosis==
Canavan disease typically results in death or development of life-threatening conditions by the age of ten, though life expectancy is variable, and is highly dependent on specific circumstances. On the other hand, the milder variants of the disorder seem not to have any effect on lifespan.

==Prevalence==

Although Canavan disease may occur in any ethnic group, it mostly affects people of Eastern European Jewish ancestry with about one in 40 (2.5%) individuals of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry being a carrier.

== History ==
Canavan disease was first described in 1931 by Myrtelle Canavan. In 1931, she co-wrote a paper discussing the case of a child who had died at 16 months old and whose brain had a spongy white section. Canavan was the first to identify this degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, which was later named Canavan disease.

===Lawsuit===

The discovery of the gene for Canavan disease, and subsequent events, generated considerable controversy. In 1987, the Greenbergs, a family with two children affected by Canavan disease, donated tissue samples to Reuben Matalon, a researcher at the University of Chicago, who was looking for the Canavan gene. He successfully identified the gene in 1993 and developed a test for it that would enable antenatal (before birth) counseling of couples at risk of having a child with the disease. For a while, the Canavan Foundation offered free genetic testing using Matalon&#x27;s test.

However, in 1997, after he relocated to Florida, Matalon&#x27;s new employer, Miami Children&#x27;s Hospital, patented the gene and started claiming royalties on the genetic test, forcing the Canavan Foundation to withdraw their free testing. A subsequent lawsuit brought by the Canavan Foundation against Miami Children&#x27;s Hospital was resolved with a sealed out-of-court settlement. The case is sometimes cited in arguments about the appropriateness of patenting genes.

==Research==
Research involving triacetin supplementation has shown promise in a rat model. Triacetin, which can be enzymatically cleaved to form acetate, enters the brain more readily than the negatively charged acetate. The defective enzyme in Canavan disease, aspartoacylase, converts &quot;N&quot;-acetylaspartate into aspartate and acetate. Mutations in the gene for aspartoacylase prevent the breakdown of &quot;N&quot;-acetylaspartate and reduce brain acetate availability during brain development. Acetate supplementation using triacetin is meant to provide the missing acetate so brain development can continue normally.

A team of researchers headed by Paola Leone at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, has tried a procedure involving the insertion of six catheters into the brain that deliver a solution containing 600 to 900 billion engineered virus particles. The virus, a modified version of adeno-associated virus, is designed to replace the aspartoacylase enzyme. Children treated with this procedure to date have shown marked improvements, including the growth of myelin, with decreased levels of the &quot;N&quot;-acetylaspartate toxin.

A team of researchers of University of Massachusetts Medical School is working on developing rAAV-based and optimized gene replacement therapy, that would travel across the blood-brain-barrier.

Researchers discovered the first drug-like inhibitors of &quot;N&quot;-acetyltransferase.

<text>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a nerve compression syndrome associated with the collected signs and symptoms of compression of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Carpal tunnel syndrome usually has no known cause, but there are environmental and medical risk factors associated with the condition. CTS can affect both wrists.

Other conditions can cause CTS such as wrist fracture or rheumatoid arthritis. After fracture, the resulting swelling, bleeding, and deformity compress the median nerve. With rheumatoid arthritis, the enlarged synovial lining of the tendons causes compression.

The main symptoms are pain in the hand, numbness, and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring finger.

Symptoms are typically most troublesome at night. Many people sleep with their wrists bent, and the ensuing symptoms may lead to awakening. Untreated, and over years to decades, CTS causes loss of sensibility, weakness, and shrinkage (atrophy) of the thenar muscles at the base of the thumb.
Work-related factors such as vibration, wrist extension or flexion, hand force, and repetitive strain are risk factors for CTS. Other risk factors include being overweight, female, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, and genetics.

Diagnosis can be made with a high probability based on characteristic symptoms and signs. It can also be measured with electrodiagnostic tests.
People wake less often at night if they wear a wrist splint. Injection of corticosteroids may or may not alleviate symptoms better than simulated (placebo) injections. There is no evidence that corticosteroid injection sustainably alters the natural history of the disease, which seems to be a gradual progression of neuropathy.

Surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is the only known disease modifying treatment.
== Anatomy ==

The carpal tunnel is an anatomical compartment located at the base of the palm. Nine flexor tendons and the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel that is surrounded on three sides by the carpal bones that form an arch. The median nerve provides feeling or sensation to the thumb, index finger, long finger, and half of the ring finger. At the level of the wrist, the median nerve supplies the muscles at the base of the thumb that allow it to abduct, move away from the other four fingers, as well as move out of the plane of the palm. The carpal tunnel is located at the middle third of the base of the palm, bounded by the bony prominence of the scaphoid tubercle and trapezium at the base of the thumb, and the hamate hook that can be palpated along the axis of the ring finger. From the anatomical position, the carpal tunnel is bordered on the anterior surface by the transverse carpal ligament, also known as the flexor retinaculum. The flexor retinaculum is a strong, fibrous band that attaches to the pisiform and the hamulus of the hamate. The proximal boundary is the distal wrist skin crease, and the distal boundary is approximated by a line known as Kaplan&#x27;s cardinal line. This line uses surface landmarks, and is drawn between the apex of the skin fold between the thumb and index finger to the palpated hamate hook.

== Pathophysiology ==

The carpal tunnel is formed by the carpal bones and the transverse carpal ligament. The median nerve passes through this space along with the flexor tendons. Increased compartmental pressure for any reason can squeeze the median nerve. Theoretically, increased pressure can interfere with normal intraneural blood flow, eventually causing a cascade of physiological changes in the nerve itself. There is a dose-respondent curve such that greater and longer periods of pressure are associated with greater nerve dysfunction. The symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome causes are hypertrophy of the synovial tissue surrounding the flexor tendons such as with rheumatoid arthritis.

Prolonged pressure can lead to a cascade of physiological changes in neural tissue. First, the blood-nerve barrier breaks down (increased permeability of perineureum and endothelial cells of endoneural blood vessels). If the pressure continues, the nerves will start the process of demyelination under the area of compression. This will result in abnormal nerve conduction even when the pressure is relieved leading to persistent sensory symptoms until remyelination can occur. If the compression continues and is severe enough, axons may be injured and Wallerian degeneration will occur. At this point there may be weakness and muscle atrophy, depending on the extent of axon damage.

The critical pressure above which the microcirculatory environment of a nerve becomes compromised depends on diastolic/systolic blood pressure. Higher blood pressure will require higher external pressure on the nerve to disrupt its microvascular environment. The critical pressure necessary to disrupt the blood supply of a nerve is approximately 30mm Hg below diastolic blood pressure or 45mm Hg below mean arterial pressure. For normohypertensive (normal blood pressure) adults, the average values for systolic blood pressure is 116mm Hg diastolic blood pressure is 69mm Hg. Using this data, the average person would become symptomatic with approximately 39mm Hg of pressure in the wrist (69 - 30 = 39 and 69 + (116 - 69)/3 - 45 ~ 40). Carpal tunnel syndrome patients tend to have elevated carpal tunnel pressures (12-31mm Hg) compared to controls (2.5 - 13mm Hg). Applying pressure to the carpal tunnel of normal subjects in a lab can produce mild neurophysiological changes at 30mm Hg with a rapid, complete sensory block at 60mm Hg. Carpal tunnel pressure may be affected by wrist movement/position, with flexion and extension capable of raising the tunnel pressure as high as 111mm Hg. Many of the activities associated with carpal tunnel symptoms such as driving, holding a phone, etc. involve flexing the wrist and it is likely due to an increase in carpal tunnel pressure during these activities.

Nerve compression can result in various stages of nerve injury. The majority of carpal tunnel syndrome patients have a degree I nerve injury (Sunderland classification), also called neuropraxia. This is characterized by a conduction block, segmental demyelination, and intact axons. With no further compression, the nerves will remyelinate and fully recover. Severe carpal tunnel syndrome patients may have degree II/III injuries (Sunderland classification), or axonotmesis, where the axon is injured partially or fully. With axon injury there would be muscle weakness or atrophy, and with no further compression the nerves may only partially recover.

While there is evidence that chronic compression is a major cause of carpal tunnel syndrome, it may not be the only cause. Several alternative, potentially speculative, theories exist which describe alternative forms of nerve entrapment. One is the theory of nerve scarring (specifically adherence between the mesoneurium and epineureum) preventing the nerve from gliding during wrist/finger movements, causing repetitive traction injuries. Another is the double crush syndrome, where compression may interfere with axonal transport, and two separate points of compression (e.g. neck and wrist), neither enough to cause local demyelination, may together impair normal nerve function.

== Epidemiology ==
Carpal tunnel syndrome is estimated to affect one out of ten people during their lifetime and is the most common nerve compression syndrome. There is notable variation in such estimates based on how one defines the problem, in particular whether one studies people presenting with symptoms vs. measurable median neuropathy whether or not people are seeking care. Idiopathic neuropathy accounts for about 90% of all nerve compression syndromes. The best data regarding CTS comes from population-based studies, which demonstrate no relationship to gender, and increasing prevalence (accumulation) with age.

== Symptoms ==
The characteristic symptom of CTS is numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in the thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger. These areas process sensation through the median nerve. Numbness or tingling is usually worse with sleep. People tend to sleep with their wrists flexed, which increases pressure on the nerve. Ache and discomfort may be reported in the forearm or even the upper arm. Symptoms that are not characteristic of CTS include pain in the wrists or hands, loss of grip strength, minor loss of sleep, and loss of manual dexterity.

As the median neuropathy gets worse, there is loss of sensibility in the thumb, index, middle, and thumb side of the ring finger. As the neuropathy progresses, there may be first weakness, then to atrophy of the muscles of thenar eminence (the flexor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, and abductor pollicis brevis). The sensibility of the palm remains normal because the superficial sensory branch of the median nerve branches proximal to the transverse carpal ligament (TCL) and travels superficial to it.

Median nerve symptoms may arise from nerve compression at the level of the thoracic outlet or the area where the median nerve passes between the two heads of the pronator teres in the forearm, although this is debated.

== Signs ==
Severe CTS is associated with measurable loss of sensibility. Diminished threshold sensibility (the ability to distinguish different amounts of pressure) can be measured using Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing. Diminished discriminant sensibility can be measured by testing two-point discrimination: the number of millimeters two points of contact need to be separated before you can distinguish them.

A person with idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome will not have any sensory loss over the thenar eminence (bulge of muscles in the palm of hand and at the base of the thumb). This is because the palmar branch of the median nerve, which innervates that area of the palm, separates from the median nerve and passes over the carpal tunnel.

Severe CTS is also associated with weakness and atrophy of the muscles at the base of the thumb. The ability to palmarly abduct the thumb may be lost. CTS can be detected on examination using one of several maneuvers to provoke paresthesia (a sensation of tingling or &quot;pins and needles&quot; in the median nerve distribution). These so-called provocative signs include:
* Phalen&#x27;s maneuver. Performed by fully flexing the wrist, then holding this position and awaiting symptoms. A positive test is one that results in paresthesia in the median nerve distribution within sixty seconds.
* Tinel&#x27;s sign is performed by lightly tapping the median nerve just proximal to flexor retinaculum to elicit paresthesia.
* Durkan&#x27;s test, &quot;carpal compression test&quot;, or applying firm pressure to the palm over the nerve for up to 30 seconds to elicit paresthesia.
* Hand elevation test The hand elevation test is performed by lifting both hands above the head. Paresthesia in the median nerve distribution within 2 minutes is considered positive.

Diagnostic performance characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity are reported, but difficult to interpret because of the lack of a consensus reference standard for CTS.

== Causes ==

Most presentations of CTS have no known disease cause (idiopathic).

The association of other factors with CTS is a source of notable debate. It is important to distinguish factors that provoke symptoms, and factors that are associated with seeking care, from factors that make the neuropathy worse.

Genetic factors are believed to be the most-important determinants of who develops carpal tunnel syndrome. In other words, one&#x27;s wrist structure seems programmed at birth to develop CTS later in life. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of carpal tunnel syndrome identified 50 genomic loci significantly associated with the disease, including several loci previously known to be associated with human height.

Some other factors that contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome are conditions such as diabetes, alcoholism, vitamin deficiency or toxicity as well as exposure to toxins. Conditions such as these don&#x27;t necessarily increase the interstitial pressure of the carpal tunnel. One case-control study noted that individuals classified as obese (BMI &gt;29) are 2.5 times more likely than slender individuals (BMI &lt;20) to be diagnosed with CTS. It is not clear whether this association is due to an alteration of pathophysiology, a variation in symptoms, or a variation in care-seeking.

=== Discrete pathophysiology and CTS ===

Hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsies is a genetic condition that appears to increase the probability of developing CTS. Heterozygous mutations in the gene SH3TC2, associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth, may confer susceptibility to neuropathy, including CTS.

Association between common benign tumors such as lipomas, ganglion, and vascular malformation should be handled with care. Such tumors are very common and are more likely to cause pressure on the median nerve. Similarly, the association between transthyretin amyloidosis-associated polyneuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome is under investigation. Prior carpal tunnel release is often noted in individuals who later present with transthyretin amyloid-associated cardiomyopathy. There is consideration that bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome could be a reason to consider amyloidosis, timely diagnosis of which could improve heart health. Amyloidosis is rare, even among people with carpal tunnel syndrome (0.55% incidence within 10 years of carpal tunnel release). In the absence of other factors associated with a notable probability of amyloidosis, it is not clear that biopsy at the time of carpal tunnel release has a suitable balance between potential harms and potential benefits.

Other specific pathophysiologies that can cause CTS via pressure include:
* Rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases that cause inflammation of the flexor tendons.
* With severe untreated hypothyroidism, generalized myxedema causes deposition of mucopolysaccharides within both the perineurium of the median nerve, as well as the tendons passing through the carpal tunnel. Association of CTS with lesser degrees of hypothyroidism is questioned.
* Pregnancy may bring out symptoms in genetically predisposed individuals, which may be caused by the temporary changes in hormones and fluid increase pressure in the carpal tunnel. High progesterone levels and water retention may increase the size of the synovium.
* Bleeding and swelling from a fracture or dislocation. This is referred to as acute carpal tunnel syndrome.
* Acromegaly causes excessive secretion of growth hormones. This causes the soft tissues and bones around the carpal tunnel to grow and compress the median nerve.

====Other considerations====
* Double crush syndrome is a debated hypothesis that nerve compression or irritation of nerve branches contributing to the median nerve in the neck, or anywhere above the wrist, increases sensitivity of the nerve to compression in the wrist. There is little evidence to support this theory and some concern that it may be used to justify more surgery.

=== CTS and activity ===
Work-related factors that increase risk of CTS include vibration (5.4 odds ratio), hand force (4.2), and repetition (2.3). Exposure to wrist extension or flexion at work increases the risk of CTS by 2.0 times. , a systematic review of studies looking at the relationship between CTS and computer use has found current studies to be inconclusive and contradictory, due to poor study methods and confounding variables not being accounted for.

The international debate regarding the relationship between CTS and repetitive hand use (at work in particular) is ongoing. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has adopted rules and regulations regarding so-called &quot;cumulative trauma disorders&quot; based concerns regarding potential harm from exposure to repetitive tasks, force, posture, and vibration.

A review of available scientific data by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) indicated that job tasks that involve highly repetitive manual acts or specific wrist postures were associated with symptoms of CTS, but there was not a clear distinction of paresthesia (appropriate) from pain (inappropriate) and causation was not established. The distinction from work-related arm pains that are not carpal tunnel syndrome was unclear. It is proposed that repetitive use of the arm can affect the biomechanics of the upper limb or cause damage to tissues. It is proposed that postural and spinal assessment along with ergonomic assessments should be considered, based on observation that addressing these factors has been found to improve comfort in some studies although experimental data are lacking and the perceived benefits may not be specific to those interventions. A 2010 survey by NIOSH showed that two-thirds of the 5million carpal tunnel diagnosed in the US that year were related to work. Women are more likely to be diagnosed with work-related carpal tunnel syndrome than men. Many if not most patients described in published series of carpal tunnel release are older and often not working.

Normal pressure of the carpal tunnel has been defined as a range of . Wrist flexion increases the pressure eight-fold and extension increases it ten-fold. There is speculation that repetitive flexion and extension in the wrist can cause thickening of the synovial tissue that lines the tendons within the carpal tunnel.

=== Associated conditions ===
A variety of patient factors can lead to CTS, including heredity, size of the carpal tunnel, associated local and systematic diseases, and certain habits. Non-traumatic causes generally happen over a period of time, and are not triggered by one certain event. Many of these factors are manifestations of physiologic aging.

== Diagnosis ==
There is no consensus reference standard for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. A combination of characteristic symptoms (how it feels) and signs (what the clinician finds on exam) are associated with a high probability of CTS without electrophysiological testing.

Electrodiagnostic testing including electromyography, and nerve conduction studies can objectively measure and verify median neuropathy.

Ultrasound can image and measure the cross sectional diameter of the median nerve, which has some correlation with CTS. The role of ultrasound in diagnosis—just as for electrodiagnostic testing—is a matter of debate. EDX cannot fully exclude the diagnosis of CTS due to the lack of sensitivity.

The role of confirmatory electrodiagnostic testing is debated. The goal of electrodiagnostic testing is to compare the speed of conduction in the median nerve with conduction in other nerves supplying the hand. When the median nerve is compressed, it will conduct more slowly than normal and more slowly than other nerves. Nerve compression results in damage to the myelin sheath and manifests as delayed latencies and slowed conduction velocities. Electrodiagnosis rests upon demonstrating impaired median nerve conduction across the carpal tunnel in context of normal conduction elsewhere.

It is often stated that normal electrodiagnostic studies do not preclude the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. The rationale for this is that a threshold of neuropathy must be reached before study results become abnormal and also that threshold values for abnormality vary. Others contend that idiopathic median neuropathy at the carpal tunnel with normal electrodiagnostic tests would represent very, very mild neuropathy that would be best managed as a normal median nerve. Even more important, notable symptoms with mild disease is strongly associated with unhelpful thoughts and symptoms of worry and despair. Notable CTS should remind clinicians to always consider the whole person, including their mindset and circumstances, in strategies to help people get and stay healthy.

A joint report published by the American Association of Neuromuscular &amp; Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM), the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPM&amp;R), and the American Academy of Neurology defines practice parameters, standards, and guidelines for EDX studies of CTS based on an extensive critical literature review. This joint review concluded median and sensory nerve conduction studies are valid and reproducible in a clinical laboratory setting and a clinical diagnosis of CTS can be made with a sensitivity greater than 85% and specificity greater than 95%. The AANEM has issued evidence-based practice guidelines for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, both by electrodiagnostic studies and by neuromuscular ultrasound.

=== Imaging ===
The role of MRI or ultrasound imaging in the diagnosis of CTS is unclear. Their routine use is not recommended. Morphological MRI has high sensitivity but low specificity for CTS. High signal intensity may suggest accumulation of axonal transportation, myelin sheath degeneration or oedema. However, more recent quantitative MRI techniques which derive repeatable, reliable and objective biomarkers from nerves and skeletal muscle may have utility, including diffusion-weighted (typically diffusion tensor) MRI which has demonstrable normal values and aberrations in carpal tunnel syndrome.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Cervical radiculopathy can also cause paresthesia abnormal sensibility in the hands and wrist. The distribution usually follows the nerve root, and the paresthesia may be provoked by neck movement. Electromyography and imaging of the cervical spine can help to differentiate cervical radiculopathy from carpal tunnel syndrome if the diagnosis is unclear. Carpal tunnel syndrome is sometimes applied as a label to anyone with pain, numbness, swelling, or burning in the radial side of the hands or wrists. When pain is the primary symptom, carpal tunnel syndrome is unlikely to be the source of the symptoms.

When the symptoms and signs point to atrophy and muscle weakness more than numbness, consider neurodegenerative disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or Charcot-Marie Tooth.

== Prevention ==
There is little or no data to support the concept that activity adjustment prevents carpal tunnel syndrome. The evidence for using a wrist rest at a computer keyboard is debated. There is also little research supporting that ergonomics is related to carpal tunnel syndrome.

Given that biological factors such as genetic predisposition and anthropometric features are more strongly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome than occupational/environmental factors such as hand use, CTS might not be prevented by activity modifications.

Some claim that worksite modifications such as switching from a QWERTY computer keyboard layout to Dvorak is helpful, but meta-analyses of the available studies note limited supported evidence.

== Treatment ==

There are more than 50 types of treatments for CTS with varied levels of evidence and recommendation across healthcare guidelines, with evidence most strongly supporting surgery, steroids, splinting for wrist positioning, and physical or occupational therapy interventions. When selecting treatment, it is important to consider the severity and chronicity of the CTS pathophysiology and to distinguish treatments that can alter the natural history of the pathophysiology (disease-modifying treatments) and treatments that only alleviate symptoms (palliative treatments). The strongest evidence for disease-modifying treatment in chronic or severe CTS cases is carpal tunnel surgery to change the shape of the carpal tunnel.

The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends proceeding conservatively with a course of nonsurgical therapies tried before release surgery is considered. A different treatment should be tried if the current treatment fails to resolve the symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks. Early surgery with carpal tunnel release is indicated where there is evidence of median nerve denervation or a person elects to proceed directly to surgical treatment. Recommendations may differ when carpal tunnel syndrome is found in association with the following conditions: diabetes mellitus, coexistent cervical radiculopathy, hypothyroidism, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome in the workplace. CTS related to another pathophysiology is addressed by treating that pathology. For instance, disease-modifying medications for rheumatoid arthritis or surgery for traumatic acute carpal tunnel syndrome.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend gabapentin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), yoga, acupuncture, low level laser therapy, magnet therapy, vitamin B6 or other supplements.

=== Splint immobilization ===
Wrist braces (splints) alleviate symptoms by keeping the wrist straight, which avoids the increased pressure in the carpal tunnel associated with wrist flexion or extension. They are used primarily to help people sleep.

Many health professionals suggest that, for the best results, one should wear braces at night. When possible, braces can be worn during the activity primarily causing stress on the wrists. The brace should not generally be used during the day as wrist activity is needed to keep the wrist from becoming stiff and to prevent muscles from weakening.

=== Corticosteroids ===
Corticosteroid injections may provide temporary alleviation of symptoms although they are not clearly better than placebo. This form of treatment is thought to reduce discomfort in those with CTS due to its ability to decrease median nerve swelling. The use of ultrasound while performing the injection is more expensive but leads to faster resolution of CTS symptoms. The injections are done under local anesthesia. This treatment is not appropriate for extended periods, however. In general, local steroid injections are only used until more definitive treatment options can be used. Corticosteroid injections do not appear to slow disease progression.

=== Surgery ===
Release of the transverse carpal ligament is undertaken in carpal tunnel surgery. The purpose of cutting the transverse carpal ligament is to relieve pressure on the median nerve, and this is a type of nerve decompression surgery. It is recommended when there is constant (not just intermittent) numbness, muscle weakness, or atrophy, and when night-splinting or other palliative interventions no longer alleviate intermittent symptoms. The surgery may be done with local or regional anesthesia with or without sedation, or under general anesthesia. In general, milder cases can be controlled without surgery for months to years, but severe cases are unrelenting symptomatically and are likely to result in surgical treatment.

=== Physical and occupational therapy ===
There are many different techniques used in manual therapy for patients with CTS. Some examples are manual and instrumental soft tissue mobilizations, massage therapy, bone mobilizations or manipulations, and neurodynamic techniques, focused on skeletal system or soft tissue.

A randomized control trial published in 2017 sought to examine the efficacy of manual therapy techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. The study included a total of 140 individuals diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and the patients were divided into two groups. One group received treatment that consisted of manual therapy. In cases of epineural tethering in the upper extremity, manual therapy can reduce this dysfunction and can have a positive impact on the gliding of the nerves through the carpal tunnel while moving the elbow, fingers, or wrist. Manual therapy included the incorporation of specified neurodynamic techniques, functional massage, and carpal bone mobilizations. Another group only received treatment through electrophysical modalities. The duration of the study was over the course of 20 physical therapy sessions for both groups. Results of this study showed that the group being treated through manual techniques and mobilizations yielded a 290% reduction in overall pain when compared with pain levels after treatment. Total function improved by 47%. Conversely, the group being treated with electrophysical modalities reported a 47% reduction in overall pain with a 9% increase in function.

Self-myofascial ligament stretching has been suggested as an effective technique, although a meta-analysis claimed this kind of therapy does not show significant improvement in symptoms or function. Tendon and nerve gliding exercises appear to be useful in carpal tunnel syndrome.

=== Alternative medicine ===
A 2018 Cochrane review on acupuncture and related interventions for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome concluded that, &quot;Acupuncture and laser acupuncture may have little or no effect in the short term on symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in comparison with placebo or sham acupuncture.&quot; It was also noted that all studies had an unclear or high overall risk of bias and that all evidence was of low or very low quality.

== Prognosis ==

The natural history of untreated CTS seems to be gradual worsening of the neuropathy. It is difficult to prove that this is always the case, but the supportive evidence is compelling.

Atrophy of the thenar muscles, weakness of palmar abduction, and loss of sensibility (constant numbness as opposed to intermittent paresthesia) are signs of advanced neuropathy. Advanced neuropathy is often permanent. The nerve will try to recover after surgery for more than 2 years, but the recovery may be incomplete.

Paresthesia may increase after release of advanced carpal tunnel syndrome, and people may feel worse than they did prior to surgery for many months.

Troublesome recovery seems related to symptoms of anxiety or depression, and unhelpful thoughts about symptoms (such as worst-case or catastrophic thinking) as well as advanced neuropathy with potentially permanent neuropathy.

Recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome after successful surgery is rare. Caution is warranted in considering additional surgery for people dissatisfied with the result of carpal tunnel release as perceived recurrence may more often be due to renewed awareness of persistent symptoms rather than worsening pathology.

== History ==
CTS was first described around 1850, but infrequently diagnosed until findings publicized by neurologist W. Russell Brain in 1947. People were often diagnosed with acroparesthesia. Clinicians would often ascribe it to &quot;poor circulation&quot; and not pursue it further.

Sir James Paget described median nerve compression at the carpal tunnel in two patients after trauma in 1854. The first was due to an injury where a cord had been wrapped around a man&#x27;s wrist. The second was related to a distal radial fracture. For the first case Paget performed an amputation of the hand. For the second case Paget recommended a wrist splint.

The first to notice the association between the carpal ligament pathology and median nerve compression appear to have been Pierre Marie and Charles Foix in 1913. They described the results of a postmortem of an 80-year-old man with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. They suggested that division of the carpal ligament would be curative in such cases. Putman had previously described a series of 37 patients and suggested a vasomotor origin. The association between the thenar muscle atrophy and compression was noted in 1914. The name &quot;carpal tunnel syndrome&quot; appears to have been coined by Moersch in 1938.

Physician George S. Phalen of the Cleveland Clinic drew attention to the pathology of compression as the reason for CTS after working with a group of patients in the 1950s and 1960s.

===Treatment===

In 1933 Sir James Learmonth outlined a method of nerve decompression of the nerve at the wrist. This procedure appears to have been pioneered by the Canadian surgeons Herbert Galloway and Andrew MacKinnon in 1924 in Winnipeg but was not published. Endoscopic release was described in 1988.

<text>Joubert syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects the cerebellum, an area of the brain that controls balance and coordination.

Joubert syndrome is one of the many genetic syndromes associated with syndromic retinitis pigmentosa. The syndrome was first identified in 1969 by pediatric neurologist Marie Joubert in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, while working at the Montreal Neurological Institute and McGill University.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Most of the signs and symptoms of the Joubert syndrome appear very early in infancy with most children showing delays in gross motor milestones. Although other signs and symptoms vary widely from individual to individual, they generally fall under the hallmark of cerebellum involvement or in this case, lack thereof. Consequently, the most common features include ataxia (lack of muscle control), hyperpnea (abnormal breathing patterns), sleep apnea, abnormal eye and tongue movements, and hypotonia in early childhood. Other malformations such as polydactyly (extra fingers and toes), cleft lip or palate, tongue abnormalities, and seizures may also occur. Developmental delays, including cognitive, are always present to some degree. Severe forms have been noted to include hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.

Those with this syndrome often exhibit specific facial features such as a broad forehead, arched eyebrows, ptosis (droopy eyelids), hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), low-set ears, and a triangle shaped mouth. Additionally, this disease can include a broad range of other abnormalities in other organ systems such as retinal dystrophy, kidney diseases, liver diseases, skeletal deformities, and endocrine (hormonal) problems.

== Genetics ==
Several mutations have been identified in individuals with Joubert syndrome (JBTS) which allowed for classification of the disorder into subtypes.

This disorder can be caused by mutations in more than 30 genes within genetic makeup. The primary cilia play an important role in the structure and function of cells. When primary cilia are mutated and defective, it can cause various genetic disorders among individuals. This mutation of primary cilia can disrupt significant signaling pathways during the development of the fetus.

Mutations in these various genes are known to cause around 60-90% of Joubert Syndrome cases. In the remaining cases, the cause is unknown if not linked to a mutation of known genes.
== Diagnosis ==
The disorder is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis and a malformed brain stem (molar tooth sign), both of which can be visualized on a transverse view of the head MRI scan. Together with this sign, the diagnosis is based on the physical symptoms and genetic testing for mutations. If the gene mutations have been identified in a family member, prenatal or carrier diagnosis can be pursued.

Joubert Syndrome is known to affect 1 in 80,000-100,000 newborns. Due to the variety of genes this disorder involves, it is likely to be underdiagnosed. It is commonly found in Ashkenazi Jewish, French-Canadians, and Hutterite ethnic populations. Most cases of Joubert syndrome are autosomal recessive; in these cases, both parents are either carriers or affected. Rarely, Joubert syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. In these cases, males are more commonly affected because they must have one X chromosome mutated, while affected females must have mutated genes on both X chromosomes.

== Treatment ==
Treatment for Joubert syndrome is symptomatic and supportive. Infants with abnormal breathing patterns should be monitored. The syndrome is associated with progressive worsening of the kidneys, the liver, and the eyes and thus requires regular monitoring.

Delays in gross motor skills, fine motor skills, and speech development are seen in almost all individuals with Joubert syndrome. Delays can be due to low muscle tone as well as impaired motor coordination. Some children have also been noted to have visual impairment due to abnormal eye movements. Developmental delays are usually treated with physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy interventions. Most children diagnosed with Joubert syndrome can achieve standard milestones, although often at a much later age.

== Prognosis ==
In a sample of 19 children, a 1997 study found that 3 died before the age of 3, and 2 never learned to walk. The children had various levels of delayed development with developmental quotients from 60 to 85.

== Research ==
Research has revealed that a number of genetic disorders, not previously thought to be related, may indeed be related as to their root cause. Joubert syndrome is one such disease. It is a member of an emerging class of diseases called ciliopathies.

The underlying cause of the ciliopathies may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell, organelles which are present in many cellular types throughout the human body. The cilia defects adversely affect &quot;numerous critical developmental signaling pathways&quot; essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases.

Currently recognized ciliopathies include Joubert syndrome, primary ciliary dyskinesia (also known as Kartagener Syndrome), Bardet–Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney disease and polycystic liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alström syndrome, Meckel–Gruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration.

Joubert syndrome type 2 is disproportionately frequent among people of Jewish descent.

<doc id="56465" wikidata="Q83124" url="?curid=56465" title="Cassava">
<text>Manihot esculenta, commonly called cassava, manioc, or yuca (among numerous regional names), is a woody shrub of the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, native to South America, from Brazil, Paraguay and parts of the Andes. Although a perennial plant, cassava is extensively cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as an annual crop for its edible starchy tuberous root. Cassava is predominantly consumed in boiled form, but substantial quantities are processed to extract cassava starch, called tapioca, which is used for food, animal feed, and industrial purposes. The Brazilian , and the related &quot;garri&quot; of West Africa, is an edible coarse flour obtained by grating cassava roots, pressing moisture off the obtained grated pulp, and finally drying it (and roasting in the case of both and &quot;garri&quot;).

Cassava is the third-largest source of carbohydrates in food in the tropics, after rice and maize, making it an important staple; more than 500 million people depend on it. It offers the advantage of being exceptionally drought-tolerant, and able to grow productively on poor soil. The largest producer is Nigeria, while Thailand is the largest exporter of cassava starch.

Cassava is grown in sweet and bitter varieties; both contain toxins, but the bitter varieties have them in much larger amounts. Cassava has to be prepared carefully for consumption, as improperly prepared material can contain sufficient cyanide to cause poisoning. The more toxic varieties of cassava have been used in some places as famine food during times of food insecurity. Farmers may however choose bitter cultivars to minimise crop losses.

== Etymology ==

The generic name &quot;Manihot&quot; and the common name &quot;manioc&quot; both derive from the Guarani (Tupi) name &quot;mandioca&quot; or &quot;manioca&quot; for the plant. The specific name &quot;esculenta&quot; is Latin for &#x27;edible&#x27;. The common name &quot;cassava&quot; is a 16th century word from the French or Portuguese &quot;cassave&quot;, in turn from Taíno &quot;caçabi&quot;. The common name &quot;yuca&quot; or &quot;yucca&quot; is most likely also from Taíno, via Spanish &quot;yuca&quot; or &quot;juca&quot;.

== Description ==

The harvested part of a cassava plant is the storage root. This is long and tapered, with an easily detached rough brown rind. The white or yellowish flesh is firm and even in texture. Commercial cultivars can be wide at the top, and some long, with a woody vascular bundle running down the middle. The tuberous roots are largely starch, with small amounts of calcium (16 milligrams per 100 grams), phosphorus (27 mg/100 g), and vitamin C (20.6 mg/100 g). Cassava roots contains little protein, whereas the leaves are rich in it, except for being low in methionine, an essential amino acid.

=== Genome ===

The complete and haplotype-resolved African cassava (TME204) genome has been reconstructed and made available using the Hi-C technology. The genome shows abundant novel gene loci with enriched functionality related to chromatin organization, meristem development, and cell responses. Differentially expressed transcripts of different haplotype origins were enriched for different functionality during tissue development. In each tissue, 20–30% of transcripts showed allele-specific expression differences with &lt;2% of direction-shifting. Despite high gene synteny, the HiFi genome assembly revealed extensive chromosome rearrangements and abundant intra-genomic and inter-genomic divergent sequences, with significant structural variations mostly related to long terminal repeat retrotransposons.

Although smallholders are otherwise economically inefficient producers, they are vital to productivity at particular times. Small cassava farmers are no exception. Genetic diversity is vital when productivity has declined due to pests and diseases, and smallholders tend to retain less productive but more diverse gene pools.

The molecular genetics of starchy root development in cassava have been analyzed and compared to other root and tuber crops, including possible (unproven) roles for
 (FT) orthologs.

== History ==

Wild populations of &quot;M. esculenta&quot; subspecies &quot;flabellifolia&quot;, shown to be the progenitor of domesticated cassava, are centered in west-central Brazil, where it was likely first domesticated no more than 10,000 years ago. Forms of the modern domesticated species can also be found growing in the wild in the south of Brazil. By 4600 BC, cassava pollen appears in the Gulf of Mexico lowlands, at the San Andrés archaeological site. The oldest direct evidence of cassava cultivation comes from a 1,400-year-old Maya site, Joya de Cerén, in El Salvador. It became a staple food of the native populations of northern South America, southern Mesoamerica, and the Taino people in the Caribbean islands, who grew it using a high-yielding form of shifting agriculture by the time of European contact in 1492. Cassava was a staple food of pre-Columbian peoples in the Americas and is often portrayed in indigenous art. The Moche people often depicted cassava in their ceramics.

Spaniards in their early occupation of Caribbean islands did not want to eat cassava or maize, which they considered insubstantial, dangerous, and not nutritious. They much preferred foods from Spain, specifically wheat bread, olive oil, red wine, and meat, and considered maize and cassava damaging to Europeans. The cultivation and consumption of cassava were nonetheless continued in both Portuguese and Spanish America. Mass production of cassava bread became the first Cuban industry established by the Spanish. Ships departing to Europe from Cuban ports such as Havana, Santiago, Bayamo, and Baracoa carried goods to Spain, but sailors needed to be provisioned for the voyage. The Spanish also needed to replenish their boats with dried meat, water, fruit, and large amounts of cassava bread. Sailors complained that it caused them digestive problems.

Portuguese traders introduced cassava to Africa from Brazil in the 16th century. Around the same period, it was introduced to Asia through Columbian Exchange by Portuguese and Spanish traders, who planted it in their colonies in Goa, Malacca, Eastern Indonesia, Timor and the Philippines. Cassava has also become an important crop in Asia. While it is a valued food staple in parts of eastern Indonesia, it is primarily cultivated for starch extraction and bio-fuel production in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Cassava is sometimes described as the &quot;bread of the tropics&quot; but should not be confused with the tropical and equatorial bread tree &quot;(Encephalartos)&quot;, the breadfruit &quot;(Artocarpus altilis)&quot; or the African breadfruit &quot;(Treculia africana)&quot;. This description definitely holds in Africa and parts of South America; in Asian countries such as Vietnam fresh cassava barely features in human diets.
Cassava was introduced to East Africa around 1850 by Arab and European settlers, who promoted its cultivation as a reliable crop to mitigate the effects of drought and famine.

There is a legend that cassava was introduced in 1880–1885 to the South Indian state of Kerala by the King of Travancore, Vishakham Thirunal Maharaja, after a great famine hit the kingdom, as a substitute for rice. However, cassava was cultivated in the state before that time. Cassava is called kappa or maricheeni in Malayalam, and tapioca in Indian English usage.

== Cultivation ==

Optimal conditions for cassava cultivation are mean annual temperatures between , annual precipitation between , and an annual growth period of no less than 240 days. Cassava is propagated by cutting the stem into sections of approximately , these being planted prior to the wet season. Cassava growth is favorable under temperatures ranging from , but it can tolerate temperatures as low as and as high as . These conditions are found, among other places, in the northern part of the Gulf Coastal Plain in Mexico. In this part of Mexico the following soil types have been shown to be good for cassava cultivation: phaeozem, regosol, arenosol, andosol and luvisol.

=== Harvesting ===

Before harvest, the leafy stems are removed. The harvest is gathered by pulling up the base of the stem and cutting off the tuberous roots.

=== Handling and storage ===

Cassava deteriorates after harvest, when the tuberous roots are first cut. The healing mechanism produces coumaric acid, which oxidizes and blackens the roots, making them inedible after a few days. This deterioration is related to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species initiated by cyanide release during mechanical harvesting. Cassava shelf life may be increased up to three weeks by overexpressing a cyanide-insensitive alternative oxidase, which suppressed ROS by 10-fold. Post-harvest deterioration is a major obstacle to the export of cassava. Fresh cassava can be preserved like potato, using thiabendazole or bleach as a fungicide, then wrapping in plastic, freezing, or applying a wax coating.

While alternative methods for controlling post-harvest deterioration have been proposed, such as preventing reactive oxygen species effects by using plastic bags during storage and transport, coating the roots with wax, or freezing roots, such strategies have proved to be economically or technically impractical, leading to breeding of cassava varieties with improved durability after harvest, achieved by different mechanisms. One approach used gamma rays to try to silence a gene involved in triggering deterioration; another strategy selected for plentiful carotenoids, antioxidants which may help to reduce oxidization after harvest.

== Pests and diseases ==

Cassava is subject to pests from multiple taxonomic groups, including nematodes, and insects, as well as diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, and fungi. All cause reductions in yield, and some cause serious losses of crops.

=== Viruses ===

Several viruses cause enough damage to cassava crops to be of economic importance. The African cassava mosaic virus causes the leaves of the cassava plant to wither, limiting the growth of the root. An outbreak of the virus in Africa in the 1920s led to a major famine. The virus is spread by the whitefly and by the transplanting of diseased plants into new fields. Sometime in the late-1980s, a mutation occurred in Uganda that made the virus even more harmful, causing the complete loss of leaves. This mutated virus spread at a rate of per year, and as of 2005 was found throughout Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. Viruses are a severe production limitation in the tropics. They are the primary reason for the complete lack of yield increases in the 25 years . Cassava brown streak virus disease is a major threat to cultivation worldwide. Cassava mosaic virus (CMV) is widespread in Africa, causing cassava mosaic disease (CMD). Bredeson et al. 2016 find the &quot;M. esculenta&quot; cultivars most widely used on that continent have &quot;M. carthaginensis&quot; subsp. &quot;glaziovii&quot; genes of which some appear to be CMD resistance genes. Although the ongoing CMD pandemic affects both East and Central Africa, Legg &quot;et al.&quot; found that these two areas have two distinct subpopulations of the vector, &quot;Bemisia tabaci&quot; whiteflies. Genetically engineered cassava offers opportunities for the improvement of virus resistance, including CMV and CBSD resistance.

=== Bacteria ===

Among the most serious bacterial pests is &quot;Xanthomonas axonopodis&quot; pv. &quot;manihotis&quot;, which causes bacterial blight of cassava. This disease originated in South America and has followed cassava around the world. Bacterial blight has been responsible for near catastrophic losses and famine in past decades, and its mitigation requires active management practices. Several other bacteria attack cassava, including the related &quot;Xanthomonas campestris&quot; pv. &quot;cassavae&quot;, which causes bacterial angular leaf spot.

=== Fungi ===
Several fungi bring about significant crop losses, one of the most serious being cassava root rot; the pathogens involved are species of &quot;Phytophthora&quot;, the genus which causes potato blight. Cassava root rot can result in losses of as much as 80 percent of the crop. 
A major pest is a rust caused by &quot;Uromyces manihotis&quot;. 
Superelongation disease, caused by &quot;Elsinoë brasiliensis&quot;, can cause losses of over 80 percent of young cassava in Latin America and the Caribbean when temperature and rainfall are high.

=== Nematodes ===

Nematode pests of cassava are thought to cause harms ranging from negligible to seriously damaging, making the choice of management methods difficult. A wide range of plant parasitic nematodes have been reported associated with cassava worldwide. These include &quot;Pratylenchus brachyurus&quot;, &quot;Rotylenchulus reniformis&quot;, &quot;Helicotylenchus&quot; spp., &quot;Scutellonema&quot; spp. and &quot;Meloidogyne&quot; spp., of which &quot;Meloidogyne incognita&quot; and &quot;Meloidogyne javanica&quot; are the most widely reported and economically important. &quot;Meloidogyne&quot; spp. feeding produces physically damaging galls with eggs inside them. Galls later merge as the females grow and enlarge, and they interfere with water and nutrient supply. Cassava roots become tough with age and restrict the movement of the juveniles and the egg release. It is therefore possible that extensive galling can be observed even at low densities following infection. Other pests and diseases can gain entry through the physical damage caused by gall formation, leading to rots. They have not been shown to cause direct damage to the enlarged tuberous roots, but plant height can be reduced if the root system is reduced.
Nematicides reduce the numbers of galls per feeder root, along with fewer rots in the tuberous roots. The organophosphorus nematicide femaniphos does not reduce crop growth or harvest yield. Nematicide use in cassava does not increase harvested yield significantly, but lower infestation at harvest and lower subsequent storage loss provide a higher effective yield. The use of tolerant and resistant cultivars is the most practical management method in most locales.

=== Insects ===

Insects such as stem borers and other beetles, moths including &quot;Chilomima clarkei&quot;, scale insects, fruit flies, shootflies, burrower bugs, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, gall midges, leafcutter ants, and termites contribute to losses of cassava in the field, while others contribute to serious losses, between 19% and 30%, of dried cassava in storage. In Africa, a previous issue was the cassava mealybug (&quot;Phenacoccus manihoti&quot;) and cassava green mite (&quot;Mononychellus tanajoa&quot;). These pests can cause up to 80 percent crop loss, which is extremely detrimental to the production of subsistence farmers. These pests were rampant in the 1970s and 1980s but were brought under control following the establishment of the Biological Control Centre for Africa of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) under the leadership of Hans Rudolf Herren. The Centre investigated biological control for cassava pests; two South American natural enemies &quot;Anagyrus lopezi&quot; (a parasitoid wasp) and &quot;Typhlodromalus aripo&quot; (a predatory mite) were found to effectively control the cassava mealybug and the cassava green mite, respectively.

== Production ==


In 2022, world production of cassava root was 330 million tonnes, led by Nigeria with 18% of the total (table). Other major growers were Democratic Republic of the Congo and Thailand.

Cassava is the third-largest source of carbohydrates in food in the tropics, after rice and maize. making it an important staple; more than 500 million people depend on it. It offers the advantage of being exceptionally drought-tolerant, and able to grow productively on poor soil. Cassava grows well within 30° of the equator, where it can be produced at up to above sea level, and with of rain per year. These environmental tolerances suit it to conditions across much of South America and Africa.

Cassava yields a large amount of food energy per unit area of land per day – , as compared with for rice, for wheat and for maize.

Cassava, yams (&quot;Dioscorea&quot; spp.), and sweet potatoes (&quot;Ipomoea batatas&quot;) are important sources of food in the tropics. The cassava plant gives the third-highest yield of carbohydrates per cultivated area among crop plants, after sugarcane and sugar beets. Cassava plays a particularly important role in agriculture in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, because it does well on poor soils and with low rainfall, and because it is a perennial that can be harvested as required. Its wide harvesting window allows it to act as a famine reserve and is invaluable in managing labor schedules. It offers flexibility to resource-poor farmers because it serves as either a subsistence or a cash crop. Worldwide, 800 million people depend on cassava as their primary food staple.

== Toxicity ==

Cassava roots, peels and leaves are dangerous to eat raw because they contain linamarin and lotaustralin, which are toxic cyanogenic glycosides. These are decomposed by the cassava enzyme linamarase, releasing poisonous hydrogen cyanide. Cassava varieties are often categorized as either bitter (high in cyanogenic glycosides) or sweet (low in those bitter compounds). Sweet cultivars can contain as little as 20 milligrams of cyanide per kilogram of fresh roots, whereas bitter cultivars may contain as much as 1000 milligrams per kilogram. Cassavas grown during drought are especially high in these toxins. A dose of 25 mg of pure cassava cyanogenic glucoside, which contains 2.5 mg of cyanide, is sufficient to kill a rat. Excess cyanide residue from improper preparation causes goiters and acute cyanide poisoning, and is linked to ataxia (a neurological disorder affecting the ability to walk, also known as &quot;konzo&quot;). It has also been linked to tropical fibrocalcific pancreatitis in humans, leading to chronic pancreatitis.

Symptoms of acute cyanide intoxication appear four or more hours after ingesting raw or poorly processed cassava: vertigo, vomiting, goiter, ataxia, partial paralysis, collapse, and death. It can be treated easily with an injection of thiosulfate (which makes sulfur available for the patient&#x27;s body to detoxify by converting the poisonous cyanide into thiocyanate).

Chronic, low-level exposure to cyanide may contribute to both goiter and tropical ataxic neuropathy, also called konzo, which can be fatal. The risk is highest in famines, when as many as 3 percent of the population may be affected.

Like many other root and tuber crops, both bitter and sweet varieties of cassava contain antinutritional factors and toxins, with the bitter varieties containing much larger amounts. The more toxic varieties of cassava have been used in some places as famine food during times of food insecurity. For example, during the shortages in Venezuela in the late 2010s, dozens of deaths were reported due to Venezuelans resorting to eating bitter cassava in order to curb starvation. Cases of cassava poisoning were also documented during the famine accompanying the Great Leap Forward (1958–1962) in China. Farmers may select bitter cultivars to reduce crop losses.

Societies that traditionally eat cassava generally understand that processing (soaking, cooking, fermentation, etc.) is necessary to avoid getting sick. Brief soaking (four hours) of cassava is not sufficient, but soaking for 18–24 hours can remove up to half the level of cyanide. Drying may not be sufficient, either.

For some smaller-rooted, sweet varieties, cooking is sufficient to eliminate all toxicity. The cyanide is carried away in the processing water and the amounts produced in domestic consumption are too small to have environmental impact. The larger-rooted, bitter varieties used for production of flour or starch must be processed to remove the cyanogenic glucosides. The large roots are peeled and then ground into flour, which is then soaked in water, squeezed dry several times, and toasted. The starch grains that flow with the water during the soaking process are also used in cooking. The flour is used throughout South America and the Caribbean. Industrial production of cassava flour, even at the cottage level, may generate enough cyanide and cyanogenic glycosides in the effluents to have a severe environmental impact.

==Uses==

===Food and drink===

There are many ways of cooking cassava. It has to be prepared correctly to remove its toxicity. The root of the sweet variety is mild to the taste, like potatoes; Jewish households sometimes use it in cholent. It can be made into a flour that is used in breads, cakes and cookies. In Brazil, &quot;farofa&quot;, a dry meal made from cooked powdered cassava, is roasted in butter, eaten as a side dish, or sprinkled on other food. In Taiwanese culture, later spread to the United States, cassava &quot;juices&quot; are dried to a fine powder and used to make tapioca, a popular starch used to make bubbles, a chewy topping in bubble tea.

Alcoholic beverages made from cassava include cauim (Brazil), kasiri (Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname), parakari or kari (Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam), and nihamanchi (South America),

=== Preparation of bitter cassava ===

An ancestral method used by the indigenous people of the Caribbean to detoxify cassava is by peeling, grinding, and mashing; filtering the mash through a basket tube (sebucan or tipiti) to remove the hydrogen cyanide; and drying and sieving the mash for flour. The poisonous filtrate water was boiled to release the hydrogen cyanide, and used as a base for stews.

A safe processing method known as the &quot;wetting method&quot; is to mix the cassava flour with water into a thick paste, spread it in a thin layer over a basket and then let it stand for five hours at 30 °C in the shade. In that time, about 83% of the cyanogenic glycosides are broken down by linamarase; the resulting hydrogen cyanide escapes to the atmosphere, making the flour safe for consumption the same evening.

The traditional method used in West Africa is to peel the roots and put them into water for three days to ferment. The roots are then dried or cooked. In Nigeria and several other west African countries, including Ghana, Cameroon, Benin, Togo, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso, they are usually grated and lightly fried in palm oil to preserve them. The result is a foodstuff called garri. Fermentation is also used in other places such as Indonesia, such as Tapai. The fermentation process also reduces the level of antinutrients, making the cassava a more nutritious food. The reliance on cassava as a food source and the resulting exposure to the goitrogenic effects of thiocyanate has been responsible for the endemic goiters seen in the Akoko area of southwestern Nigeria.

Bioengineering has been applied to grow cassava with lower cyanogenic glycosides combined with fortification of vitamin A, iron and protein to improve the nutrition of people in sub-Saharan Africa.

In Guyana the traditional cassareep is made from bitter cassava juice. The juice is boiled until it is reduced by half in volume, to the consistency of molasses and flavored with spices—including cloves, cinnamon, salt, sugar, and cayenne pepper. Traditionally, cassareep was boiled in a soft pot, the actual &quot;pepper pot&quot;, which would absorb the flavors and also impart them (even if dry) to foods such as rice and chicken cooked in it. The poisonous but volatile hydrogen cyanide is evaporated by heating. Nevertheless, improperly cooked cassava has been blamed for a number of deaths. Amerindians from Guyana reportedly made an antidote by steeping chili peppers in rum. The natives of Guyana traditionally brought the product to town in bottles, and it is available on the US market in bottled form.

=== Nutrition ===

Raw cassava is 60% water, 38% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat (table). In a reference serving, raw cassava provides of food energy and 23% of the Daily Value (DV) of vitamin C, but otherwise has no micronutrients in significant content (i.e., above 10% of the relevant DV).

=== Biofuel ===

Cassava has been studied as a feedstock to produce ethanol as a biofuel, including to improve the efficiency of conversion from cassava flour, and to convert crop residues such as stems and leaves as well as the more easily processed roots. China has created facilities to produce substantial amounts of ethanol fuel from cassava roots.

===Animal feed===

Cassava roots and hay are used worldwide as animal feed. Young cassava hay is harvested at three to four month, when it reaches about above ground; it is dried in the sun until its dry matter content approaches 85 percent. The hay contains 20–27 percent protein and 1.5–4 percent tannin. It is valued as a source of roughage for ruminants such as cattle.

=== Laundry starch ===

Cassava is used in laundry products, especially as starch to stiffen shirts and other garments.

== Folklore ==

In Java, a myth relates that food derives from the body of Dewi Teknowati, who killed herself rather than accept the advances of the god Batara Guru. She was buried, and her lower leg grew into a cassava plant.
In Trinidad, folk stories tell of a &quot;saapina&quot; or snake-woman; the word is related to &quot;sabada&quot;, meaning to pound, for what is traditionally a woman&#x27;s work of pounding cassava.

The identity of the Macushi people of Guyana is closely bound up with the growth and processing of cassava in their slash-and-burn subsistence lifestyle. A story tells that the great spirit Makunaima climbed a tree, cutting off pieces with his axe; when they landed on the ground, each piece became a type of animal. The opossum brought the people to the tree, where they found all the types of food, including bitter cassava. A bird told the people how to prepare the cassava safely.

<text>Neurofibromatosis (NF) refers to a group of three distinct genetic conditions in which tumors grow in the nervous system. The tumors are non-cancerous (benign) and often involve the skin or surrounding bone. Although symptoms are often mild, each condition presents differently. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is typically characterized by café au lait spots (light-brown flat patches of skin), neurofibromas (small bumps in or under the skin), scoliosis (side-way curvature of the back), and headaches. Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), on the other hand, may present with early-onset hearing loss, cataracts, tinnitus, difficulty walking or maintaining balance, and muscle atrophy. The third type is called schwannomatosis and often presents in early adulthood with widespread pain, numbness, or tingling due to nerve compression.
The cause is a genetic mutation in certain oncogenes. These can be inherited, or in about half of cases spontaneously occur during early development. Different mutations result in the three types of NF. Neurofibromatosis arise from the supporting cells of the nervous system rather than the neurons themselves. In NF1, the tumors are neurofibromas (tumors of the peripheral nerves), while in NF2 and schwannomatosis tumors of Schwann cells are more common. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms, examination, medical imaging, and biopsy. Genetic testing may rarely be done to support the diagnosis.
There is no known prevention or cure. Surgery may be done to remove tumors that are causing problems or have become cancerous. Radiation and chemotherapy may also be used if cancer occurs. A cochlear implant or auditory brainstem implant may help some who have hearing loss due to the condition.
In the United States, about 1 in 3,500 people have NF1 and 1 in 25,000 have NF2. Males and females are affected equally often. In NF1, symptoms are often present at birth or develop before 10 years of age. While the condition typically worsens with time, most people with NF1 have a normal life expectancy. In NF2, symptoms may not become apparent until early adulthood. NF2 increases the risk of early death. Descriptions of the condition occur as far back as the 1st century. It was formally described by Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1882, after whom it was previously named.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Neurofibromatosis type 1 in early life may cause learning and behavior problems – about 60% of children who have NF1 have mild difficulty in school. Signs the individual might have are as follows:
* Six or more light brown dermatological spots (&quot;café au lait spots&quot;)
* At least two neurofibromas
* At least two growths on the eye&#x27;s iris
* Abnormal growth of the spine (scoliosis)
* Lisch nodules
* Tumors on the adrenal glands called pheochromocytomas

People with neurofibromatosis type 2 can exhibit the same type of skin symptoms as type 1, but not necessarily in every case. Symptoms may include pain due to pressure on nerves, tinnitus, weakness in fingers, numbness, headaches. The symptom most characteristic of NF2 is hearing loss. The hearing loss occurs due to the pressure of tumors on the acoustic nerve. The same pressure can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea.

The main symptom of schwannomatosis is localized pain. This pain is due to tissues and nerves experiencing more pressure because of nearby tumors.

==Cause==

The three types of neurofibromatosis are caused by different mutations on chromosomes. NF1 is caused by a mutation on the NF1 gene on the arm of chromosome 17. NF2 is caused by a mutation on the NF2 tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22. Schwannomatosis is caused by various mutations on chromosome 22.

Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means only one copy of the affected gene is needed for the disorder to develop. If one parent has neurofibromatosis, his or her children have a 50% chance of developing the condition as well. The severity of the parent&#x27;s condition does not affect the child; the affected child may have mild NF1 even though it was inherited from a parent with a severe form of the disorder. The types of neurofibromatosis are:
* Neurofibromatosis type I, in which the nerve tissue grows tumors (neurofibromas) that may be benign, but may cause serious damage by compressing nerves and other tissues.
* Neurofibromatosis type II, in which bilateral acoustic neuromas (tumors of the vestibulocochlear nerve or cranial nerve 8 (CN VIII) also known as schwannoma) develop, often leading to hearing loss. 
* Schwannomatosis, in which painful schwannomas develop on spinal and peripheral nerves.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology is varied, and each NF type has a different one:

* Neurofibromatosis type I is the most common of the three types and is caused by genetic changes in the NF1 gene located on chromosome 17 (17q11.2). This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein known the neurofibromin, which functions as a tumor suppressor and therefore serves as a signal regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. A dysfunction or lack of neurofibromin can affect regulation, and cause uncontrolled cell proliferation, leading to the tumors (neurofibromas) that characterize NF1. The neurofibromas caused by NF consist of Schwann cells, fibroblasts, perineuronal cells, mast cells and axons embedded in an extracellular matrix. Another function of neurofibromin is to bind to microtubules that play a role in the release of adenylyl cyclase and its activity. Adenylyl cyclase plays an essential role in cognition. Neurofibromin&#x27;s role in the activity of adenylyl cyclase explains why patients with NF experience cognitive impairment.

* Neurofibromatosis type II is caused by a mutation on chromosome 22 (22q12). The mutation falls on the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. The gene normally encodes a cytoplasmic protein known as merlin. The normal function of merlin is to regulate the activity of multiple growth factors, the mutated copy of the gene leads to merlin&#x27;s loss of function. The loss of function leads to increased activity of growth factors normally regulated by merlin, leading to the formation of the tumors associated with NF2.

* Schwannomatosis is caused by a mutation on the SMARCB1 gene. This gene is located near the NF2 tumor suppressor gene leading to the thought that schwannomatosis and NF2 were the same condition. The two conditions show different mutations on two different genes. The normal function of the SMARCB1 gene is to encode a protein called SMARCB1 that is part of a larger protein complex whose function is not completely understood. The complex including SMARCB1 plays a role in tumor suppression. The mutation of the SMARCB1 gene causes a loss of function in the complex leading to the formation of tumors indicative of schwannomatosis.

==Diagnosis==

The neurofibromatoses are considered as RASopathies and as members of the &quot;neurocutaneous syndromes&quot; (&quot;phakomatoses&quot;).
The diagnosis of neurofibromatosis is done via the following means:

===Differential diagnosis===
Conditions similar to NF include:

==Treatment==
Surgical removal of tumors is an option; however, the risks involved should be assessed first. With regard to OPG (optic pathway gliomas), the preferred treatment is chemotherapy. However, radiotherapy is not recommended in children who present with this disorder. It is recommended that children diagnosed with NF1 at an early age have an examination each year, which allows any potential growths or changes related to the disorder to be monitored.

==Prognosis==

In most cases, symptoms of NF1 are mild, and individuals live normal and productive lives. In some cases, however, NF1 can be severely debilitating and may cause cosmetic and psychological issues. The course of NF2 varies greatly among individuals. In some cases of NF2, the damage to nearby vital structures, such as other cranial nerves and the brain stem, can be life-threatening. Most individuals with schwannomatosis have significant pain. In some extreme cases, the pain will be severe and disabling.

==Epidemiology==
In the United States, about 1 in 3,500 people have NF1, 1 in 25,000 have NF2, and 1 in 40,000 have schwannomatosis. Males and females are affected equally often in all three conditions. In NF1, symptoms are often present at birth or develop before 10 years of age. While the condition typically worsens with time, most people with NF1 have a normal life expectancy. In NF2, symptoms may not become apparent until early adulthood. NF2 increases the risk of early death. Schwannomatosis symptoms develop in early childhood and can worsen with time. Typically life expectancy is unaffected in those with schwannomatosis.

==History==
Descriptions of what is believed to be the condition go as far back as the 1st century. The conditions were formally described by Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1882, after whom it was previously named.

<doc id="56469" wikidata="Q1876206" url="?curid=56469" title="Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease">
<text>Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is an X-linked neurological disorder that damages oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. It is caused by mutations in proteolipid protein 1 (&quot;PLP1&quot;), a major myelin protein. It is characterized by a decrease in the amount of insulating myelin surrounding the nerves (hypomyelination) and belongs to a group of genetic diseases referred to as leukodystrophies.

==Signs and symptoms==
The hallmark signs and symptoms of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease include little or no movement in the arms or legs, respiratory difficulties, and characteristic horizontal movements of the eyes left to right.

The onset of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is usually in early infancy. The most characteristic early signs are nystagmus (rapid, involuntary, rhythmic motion of the eyes) and low muscle tone. Motor abilities are delayed or never acquired, mostly depending upon the severity of the mutation. Most children with Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease learn to understand language, and usually have some speech. Other signs may include tremor, lack of coordination, involuntary movements, weakness, unsteady gait, and over time, spasticity in legs and arms. Muscle contractures often occur over time. Mental functions may deteriorate. Some patients may have convulsions and skeletal deformation, such as scoliosis, resulting from abnormal muscular stress on bones.

==Cause==
Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is caused by X-linked recessive mutations in the major myelin protein proteolipid protein 1 (&quot;PLP1&quot;). This causes hypomyelination in the central nervous system and severe neurological disease. The majority of mutations result in duplications of the entire &quot;PLP1&quot; gene. Deletions of &quot;PLP1&quot; locus (which are rare) cause a milder form of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease than is observed with the typical duplication mutations, which demonstrates the critical importance of gene dosage at this locus for normal CNS function.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is often first suggested after identification by magnetic resonance imaging of abnormal white matter (high T2 signal intensity, i.e. T2 lengthening) throughout the brain, which is typically evident by about 1 year of age, but more subtle abnormalities should be evident during infancy. Unless a family history consistent with sex-linked inheritance exists, the condition is often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy. Once a &quot;PLP1&quot; mutation is identified, prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation genetic diagnostic testing is possible.

===Classification===
The disease is one in a group of genetic disorders collectively known as leukodystrophies that affect the growth of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering—which acts as an insulator—on nerve fibers in the central nervous system. The several forms of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease include classic, congenital, transitional, and adult variants. Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease is the common name for hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (HLD). There are at least 26 HLD variants cataloged by the National Institutes of Health National Library of Medicine and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes.

Milder mutations of the &quot;PLP1&quot; gene that mainly cause leg weakness and spasticity, with little or no cerebral involvement, are classified as spastic paraplegia 2 (SPG2).

==Treatment==
No cure for Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease has been developed. Outcomes are variable: people with the most severe form of the disease do not usually survive to adolescence, although with milder forms, survival into adulthood is possible.

A phase I clinical trial using an antisense oligonucleotide (known as ION356) targeted against &quot;PLP1&quot; is expected to begin in early 2024.

==Research==
In December 2008, StemCells, Inc received clearance in the United States to conduct a phase I clinical trials of human neural stem cell transplantation. The trial did not show meaningful efficacy and the company has since gone bankrupt.

In 2019 Paul Tesar, a professor at Case Western Reserve University, used CRISPR and antisense therapy in a mouse model of Pelizaeus–Merzbacher with success. In 2022 Case Western Reserve University entered an exclusive licensing agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to develop a human treatment for the disorder.

<text>Leopold I (born Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld; 16 December 1790 – 10 December 1865) was the first king of the Belgians, reigning from 21 July 1831 until his death in 1865.

The youngest son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Leopold took a commission in the Imperial Russian Army and fought against Napoleon after French troops overran Saxe-Coburg during the Napoleonic Wars. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, Leopold moved to the United Kingdom, where in 1816 he married Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only child of the British Prince Regent (later George IV). Leopold and Charlotte&#x27;s marriage was happy, but it ended after a year and a half when Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son. Leopold continued to enjoy considerable status in Britain.

After the Greek War of Independence, Leopold was offered the throne of Greece under the 1830 London Protocol that created an independent Greek state, but turned it down, believing it to be too precarious. Instead, he accepted the throne of Belgium in 1831 following the country&#x27;s independence in 1830. The Belgian government offered the position to Leopold because of his diplomatic connections with royal houses across Europe, and because as the British-backed candidate, he was not affiliated with other powers, such as France, which were believed to have territorial ambitions in Belgium which might threaten the European balance of power created by the 1815 Congress of Vienna.

Leopold took his oath as King of the Belgians on 21 July 1831, an event commemorated annually as Belgian National Day. The following year, he married Princess Louise of Orléans, with whom he had four children: Louis Philippe, Leopold, Philippe, and Charlotte. The King had another two sons, George and Arthur, by his mistress, Arcadie Claret. Leopold&#x27;s reign was marked by attempts by the Dutch to recapture Belgium and, later, by internal political division between Liberals and Catholics. As a Protestant, Leopold was considered liberal and encouraged economic modernisation, playing an important role in funding the creation of Belgium&#x27;s first railway in 1835 and subsequent industrialisation. As a result of the ambiguities in the Belgian Constitution, Leopold was able to slightly expand the monarch&#x27;s powers during his reign and assumed multiple ministries. He also played an important role in stopping the spread of the Revolutions of 1848 into Belgium. He died in 1865 and was succeeded by his son, Leopold II.

==Early life==

Leopold was born at Ehrenburg Palace in Coburg in the small German duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in modern-day Bavaria on 16 December 1790. He was the eighth child and youngest son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and Countess Augusta Reuss of Ebersdorf. In 1826, Saxe-Coburg had acquired the city of Gotha from the neighbouring Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and gave up Saalfeld to Saxe-Meiningen, becoming Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The dynasty of this name was therefore founded by Leopold&#x27;s eldest brother, Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the father of Albert, Prince Consort of the United Kingdom. Leopold was baptised on 17 December 1790, with his baptismal name remaining the same as his birth name, in honour of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor. Leopold&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Princess Sophie Antoinette of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, often assisted in parenting duties and signalled that he was her favourite grandson.

From 1797, Leopold was tutored by Charles-Theodore Hoflender, a graduate of the University of Jena and a professor in Coburg. Leopold, under Hoflender, studied Biblical history, Christianity, mathematics and languages, including Greek, Latin and Russian. In 1799, Leopold and his siblings also became tutored by Johann Philipp Hohnbaum, who specialised in teaching physical education and in teaching history of Great Britain, the Holy Roman Empire and Saxony. Hohnbaum cited that Leopold was fascinated by history and conflicts such as the Thirty Years War. Lutheran pastor Gottlieb Scheler also taught Leopold catechism. Historian Olivier Defrance wrote that Scheler&#x27;s teaching of Pietism had a lasting influence on Leopold. From 1804, aged thirteen, Leopold kept a diary and learnt English, French and Italian. Leopold often heard stories of military experience from his great-uncle, Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and inherited his father&#x27;s passion for pigeon racing and floriculture.

==Pre-regnal years==
===Military career===
====Russian Imperial army====
In 1796, Leopold&#x27;s older sister, Princess Juliane of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, married Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia, making the House of Romanov her house by marriage. The following year, at just six years old, Leopold received a Russian military title. He achieved the rank of captain and subsequently was given an honorary commission of the rank of colonel in the &quot;Izmaylovsky&quot; Regiment, part of the Imperial Guard, in the Imperial Russian Army, on 7 May 1789 and 11 September 1798. Leopold also began to specialise in the Russian language. On 19 March 1801, he was transferred to the Imperial Guard Cavalry Regiment, when six years later, aged twelve, he received a promotion to the rank of major general.

In 1805, at fourteen years old, Leopold accompanied his older brother, Ernest, Hereditary Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, to Moravia, where the headquarters of Alexander I, Emperor of Russia were located, however Leopold nor Ernest partook in combat. Following the Battle of Austerlitz, during the Napoleonic Wars, French troops occupied the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg in 1806. Leopold and his father, Francis, took refuge in Saalfeld, however Francis died on 9 December 1806, six days before the Treaty of Poznan signed the Duchy to the Confederation of the Rhine, thus abolishing the Duchy&#x27;s sovereignty. When Napoleon learned that Ernest had previously fought against the French, he removed the Duchy from the Confederation, before seizing the properties of Leopold&#x27;s family. Leopold and his mother were confined to a section of one of the confiscated castles and were not let out. During this time, Leopold wrote to his sister, Princess Sophie of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld: &quot;The poor country of Cobourg is terribly penalized; It must pay 981,000 francs; it&#x27;s huge. Our coffers and our estates, in short all our income, were confiscated by the Emperor Napoleon. No appanage can be paid.&quot; After intervention by the Russian Emperor, Napoleon declared the Duchy to be part of the Confederation of the Rhine once more by adding it to the Treaty of Tilsit. Ernest as the new reigning Duke was allowed to return to Coburg in July 1807.
Leopold soon went to Paris where he became part of the Imperial Court of Napoleon. Napoleon&#x27;s wife, Joséphine de Beauharnais, took a protective attitude of Leopold, who met Napoleon in October 1808. According to historian Carlo Bronne, Napoloen was in awe of Leopold and briefly considered making him is aide-de-camp. In Spring 1808, Leopold contracted typhoid fever and when he recovered, he shortly became regent of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld when Ernest visited Russia. Napoleon later offered Leopold the position of adjutant, but he refused and instead went to Russia to take up a military career in the Imperial Russian cavalry, which then later went to war with France. Leopold accompanied Emperor Alexander I in September 1808 and represented his home Duchy at the Congress of Erfurt, where Napoleon failed to strengthen Franco-Russian relations while the Duchy&#x27;s interests were ignored. He wrote to Alexander I for assistance, leading to Napoleon demanding that he resign from the Russian army.

====Napoleonic battles====
In Autumn 1810, Leopold was asked by Ernest to find financial aid for the Duchy, which was lacking soldiers and had been badly affected by war and its previous occupation. Leopold met with Napoleon, who refused to aid the Duchy, but offered that Leopold join the French army. Leopold strongly refused, as did Joséphine. In May 1811, Leopold went to Munich and although he was unsuccessful in securing funding, he managed to persuade Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria to return small territories that Bavaria had previously annexed from the Duchy. Leopold was hailed in the media for this achievement. Following his visit to Munich, Leopold travelled to Vienna, then to various Italian cities during the winter. He wrote: &quot;The years of 1810 and 1811 were quite calm. I was disappointed to find myself forbidden from serving in Russia by Napoleon who held my brother responsible, because he knew that otherwise he would not have been able to prevent me.&quot; In March 1813, Leopold was finally allowed to rejoin the Russian Imperial army.

During 1813, Leopold was an active member of the Russian army and participated in the liberation of German states from Napoleonic France. On 28 February 1813, after the signing of the Treaty of Kalisz, Leopold said to Emperor Alexander, &quot;I was the first German Prince who joined the liberating army&quot;. Leopold participated in multiple conflicts against French troops, including the Battle of Lützen, Battle of Bautzen and Battle of Leipzig. He worked closely with his brother-in-law, Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia, during this time. On 26 August 1813, Leopold helped Duke Eugen of Württemberg escape his occupiers. Three days later, Leopold was nearly captured by French forces. Later, on 29 and 30 August 1813, Leopold fought in the Battle of Kulm as the head of his &quot;cuirassier&quot; division. The battle was a French loss, and Leopold was decorated for his participation with the Cross of St. George, the Order of St. Andrew, the Order of Alexander Nevsky, the Order of Saint Anna and the Kulm Cross. Additionally, he was promoted to Major General in the Russian Army.

Leopold and Konstantin Pavlovich were unsuccessful in reuniting with Leopold&#x27;s sister, Julianne, in Bern in January 1814. Leopold entered France with the Russian army on 30 January. On 1 February, he participated in the Battle of Brienne, which resulted in the occupation of Troyes. Additionally, during the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube, Leopold commanded the right wing on the army, with France successfully defeated, before Paris was marched on four days later. On 31 March, Leopold too entered Paris, as Napoleon fell, to which Leopold commented: &quot;This is the extent to which prudence has humiliated this tyrant, to the horror of all those who would want to follow his example.&quot; Leopold and Ernest represented the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld at the Congress of Vienna. The Kingdom of Prussia, which Leopold and the Russian Imperial army had fought alongside, was opposed to any gains made by the Duchy, which had been against the annexation of Saxony, an ally of France. During the Congress, Leopold held audience with Archduke John of Austria and Chancellor Klemens von Metternich. When Napoleon returned from exile in March 1815, Leopold commanded a Russian cavalry brigade as a lieutenant general, aged 25, on the outskirts of France, as Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo.

===Marriage to Charlotte of Wales===


In Spring 1814, Leopold accompanied Emperor Alexander to England, where Princess Charlotte of Wales was seeking a spouse. Charlotte was the only legitimate child of Prince George, Prince Regent (later George IV), and therefore second in line to the British throne. George had hoped Charlotte would marry William, Prince of Orange, but Charlotte favoured Leopold. Emperor Alexander was also opposed to Charlotte marrying William as he believed a future personal union between Great Britain and the Netherlands would become a maritime superpower and dominate the seas. Leopold and Charlotte lost contact for months, and the latter often wrote to the former asking that he return to Britain to propose to her. Leopold received British citizenship in March 1816. Finally, the pair married at Carlton House in London on 2 May 1816. Although George was displeased, he found Leopold to be charming and possessing every quality to make his daughter happy, and so approved their marriage. The same year Leopold received an honorary commission to the rank of Field Marshal and Knight of the Order of the Garter. The Regent also considered making Leopold a royal duke, the Duke of Kendal, though the plan was abandoned due to government fears that it would draw Leopold into party politics and would be viewed as a demotion for Charlotte. The couple lived initially at Camelford House on Park Lane, and then at Marlborough House on Pall Mall.

Leopold and Charlotte moved into Claremont House in August 1816. When Charlotte later suffered a miscarriage, Leopold became concerned for her health. When Charlotte again fell pregnant, she was advised by her obstetrician, Sir Richard Croft, to drastically reduce her diet, however Leopold&#x27;s physician, Christian Stockmar, heavily disagreed with this advice. Charlotte gave birth to a stillborn son on 5 November 1817. She suffered complications and, just after midnight on 6 November, also died. Leopold was said to have been heartbroken by Charlotte&#x27;s death.


Had Charlotte survived, she would have become queen of the United Kingdom on the death of her father and Leopold presumably would have assumed the role of prince consort, later taken by his nephew Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Stockmar, who became Leopold&#x27;s private secretary, advised him to stay in Britain rather than returning to Coburg and despite Charlotte&#x27;s death, George granted Leopold the British style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; by Order in Council on 6 April 1818. However, the British public was opposed to the annuity of 50,000 pounds sterling paid by the British government to Leopold, who was no longer even a member of the British royal family. From 1828 to 1829, Leopold had an affair with the actress Caroline Bauer, who bore a striking resemblance to Charlotte. Caroline was a cousin of Stockmar. She came to England with her mother and took up residence at Longwood House, a few miles from Claremont House. But, by mid-1829, the liaison was over, and the actress and her mother returned to Berlin. Many years later, in memoirs published after her death, she declared that she and Leopold had engaged in a morganatic marriage and that he had bestowed upon her the title of Countess Montgomery. He would have broken this marriage when the possibility arose that he could become King of Greece. The son of Stockmar denied that these events ever happened, and indeed no records have been found of a civil or religious marriage with the actress.

Following Charlotte&#x27;s death, Leopold assisted members of his family in acceding to various European thrones. He encouraged his sister, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to marry George&#x27;s brother, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, after her first husband, Emich Carl, 2nd Prince of Leiningen, had died. Victoria and Edward were the parents of the future Queen Victoria, who was born in 1819 and lost her father in 1820. Leopold allowed her and her mother to live with him in Claremont House and convinced George, who was now monarch, to give apartments in Kensington Palace to them. Leopold went on to support George&#x27;s wife, Caroline of Brunswick, in marital disputes and even visited Caroline during George&#x27;s crowning, leading to disdain from George. Leopold nonetheless remained in Britain for another fourteen years after the death of Charlotte, however regularly travelled Europe.

In 1819, Leopold received Niederfüllbach Castle in Coburg and began preparing to make it his main residence. Leopold&#x27;s brother, Ernest, had married Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, who went on to inherit the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha, though Ernest insisted he reigned over it. From thereon, Ernest&#x27;s Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Louise&#x27;s Duchy of Saxe-Gotha merged to form the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Before the couple divorced in 1826, Ernest and Louise had two sons, the future Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Albert, who went on to marry Queen Victoria. Whilst in Paris, Leopold was encouraged to marry Marie-Caroline of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duchess of Berry, the widowed daughter-in-law of Charles X of France, however Leopold declined due to differing views and opinions on matters with the French royal house.

===Refusal of the Greek throne===
Following a Greek rebellion against the Ottoman Empire, Leopold was offered the throne of an independent Greece as part of the London Protocol of February 1830, which stipulated that the new monarch could not be of Great Britain, France or Russia.

Though Leopold resided in Britain, he was not considered a member of the British royal family as he was not of the House of Hanover. He was quite popular across Europe for his role in the Napoleonic wars and, according to Defrance, was often mentioned in Greek &quot;anglophile circles&quot;. Despite popularity, he was often in dispute with George and the British government, who supported Leopold as a candidate for the Greek throne and subsequently demanded he give up his British possessions. Leopold eventually agreed and accepted this offer from Duke of Wellington, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and his Cabinet. However, Leopold was still anxious to accept the Greek throne and demanded certain conditions, including having the Greco-Ottoman border changed in Greece&#x27;s favour by amending the border crossing the Achelous River and Valley, receiving financial and military aid while the state was being set up, and having protection of Greece by the Great Powers from foreign aggression. He argued this zone of protection should be extended all the way to Samos and Crete, whose populations had been active in the Greek War of Independence. Most of his demands were agreed to in a series of discussions, with particular priority in protecting the majority Christian inhabitants of the Greek islands. With the Great Powers mainly satisfied, they signed new international protocol, officially giving Leopold, &quot;the son-in-law of George IV&quot;, the title of &quot;Sovereign Prince of Greece&quot;. A few days later, on 28 February 1830, Leopold officially accepted the Greek crown.

Leopold contacted Ioannis Kapodistrias, the &quot;de facto&quot; Governor of the Greek State, who he had known since the Napoleonic Wars. Leopold asked of him in his letters to provide assistance in his accession to the throne, however Kapodistrias&#x27; reply on 6 April was not of reassuring nature. Kapodistrias insisted that Leopold&#x27;s border changes did not satisfy Greece, provoked the Ottoman Empire and would need to be ratified by the legislature. Contrary to historians Michel Lhéritier and Édouard Driault, Defrance claims that Kapodistrias&#x27;s motive was to possibly intimidate Leopold. Kapodistrias also very strongly encouraged Leopold to convert to Greek Orthodoxy to the wishes of the Greek people, but Leopold was displeased by this. Later that month, the Greek Senate drafted a memorandum addressed to Leopold to welcome him and give a list of requests of the Greek people, including the border issue, the inclusion of Samos, Crete and Psara in the new Greek nation and the religion of Leopold. From London, Leopold worked to achieve these requests and even succeeded in increasing loans granted to Greece from 12 million to 60 million francs, however he failed to resolve the border dispute and annex Crete from the Ottoman Empire. Feeling the Greek population was too demanding and precarious, Leopold turned down the offer to become King of Greece on 17 May 1830. The role would subsequently be accepted by Otto of Wittelsbach in May 1832 who ruled until he was finally deposed in October 1862. Otto would then be replaced by the House of Glücksburg, with Prince Wilhelm of Denmark becoming George I of Greece.

==Reign==
===Acceptance of the Belgian throne===
====Search for a monarch====
At the end of August 1830, rebels in the Southern provinces (modern-day Belgium) of the United Netherlands rose up against Dutch rule. The rising, which began in Brussels, pushed the Dutch army back, and the rebels defended themselves against a Dutch attack. International powers meeting in London agreed to support the independence of Belgium, even though the Dutch refused to recognize the new state. In November 1830, a National Congress was established in Belgium to create a constitution for the new state. Fears of &quot;mob rule&quot; associated with republicanism after the French Revolution of 1789, as well as the example of the recent, liberal July Revolution in France, led the Congress to decide that Belgium would be a popular, constitutional monarchy. The choice of candidates for the position was one of the most controversial issues faced by the revolutionaries. The Congress refused to consider any candidate from the Dutch ruling house of Orange-Nassau. Some Orangists had hoped to offer the position to William I or his son, William, Prince of Orange, which would bring Belgium into personal union with the Netherlands like Luxembourg. The Great Powers also worried that a candidate from another state could risk destabilizing the international balance of power and lobbied for a neutral candidate.

Eventually the Congress was able to draw up a shortlist. The viable possibilities were felt to be Auguste of Leuchtenberg, son of Eugène de Beauharnais, and Louis, Duke of Nemours, son of the Louis Philippe I of France. All the candidates were French and the choice between them was principally between choosing the Bonapartism of Beauharnais or Leuchtenberg and supporting the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe. Louis Philippe realized that the choice of either of the Bonapartists could be first stage of a coup against him, but that his son would also be unacceptable to other European powers suspicious of French intentions. Nemours refused the offer. With no definitive choice in sight, Catholics and Liberals united to elect Erasme Louis Surlet de Chokier, a minor Belgian nobleman, as regent to buy more time for a definitive decision in February 1831.

Due to opposition of previous candidates, the Belgian Congress proposed Leopold, who had been proposed at an early stage, but had been dropped because of French opposition. The problems caused by the French candidates and the increased international pressure for a solution led to his reconsideration. Leopold was known by the Congress due to his military past and a delegation of Belgian representatives was sent to London to meet Leopold. On 22 April, he was finally approached by said delegation at Marlborough House to officially offer him the throne. Leopold read over the Treaty of the Eighteen Articles prior to it being signed on 9 July 1831, officially separating Belgium and the Netherlands. The treaty also included the possibility of a repurchase of Luxembourg by Belgium. Despite all this, Leopold remained reluctant to accept the Belgian throne.

====Accession====
On 16 July 1831, Leopold travelled from Dover to Calais on the royal yacht &quot;Crusader&quot;, deciding to accept the throne. The next day he drove by car to Dunkirk and entered Belgium at De Panne. Whilst travelling to Brussels on horseback, he was greeted with patriotic enthusiasm along his route. The accession ceremony took place on 21 July on the Place Royale in Brussels. A stand had been erected on the steps of the Church of St. James on Coudenberg, surrounded by the names of revolutionaries fallen during the fighting in 1830. After a ceremony of resignation by the regent, Leopold, dressed in the uniform of a Belgian lieutenant-general, swore loyalty to the constitution, under the supervision of congressman Jean-Baptiste Nothomb, and became king. Leopold said in his speech: &quot;I have come hither to work for the welfare of this country, and to preserve, by my acceptance of the crown, the peace of Europe; whatever can contribute to these two things, I will do it; anything beyond that will be harmful.&quot; Leopold&#x27;s enthronement has generally been used to mark the end of the revolution and the start of the Kingdom of Belgium and is celebrated each year as the Belgian national holiday.

===Consolidation of independence===
Although the Belgian Constitution to which Leopold swore gave the monarch command of the army only as an honorary title, Leopold signalled on multiple occasions that he would personally place himself in charge of the army if Belgium were to be attacked. The Belgian population was widely content with this due to his previous military experience. Less than two weeks after Leopold&#x27;s accession, on 2 August 1831, the Netherlands invaded Belgium, starting the Ten Days&#x27; Campaign. Leopold immediately requested that Belgian Prime Minister, Joseph Lebeau, contact the foreign offices in London and Paris for assistance. Leopold here followed the Constitution, which forbade him personally from calling upon foreign powers without permission from the legislature, which at this time had not yet been elected. The small Belgian army was overwhelmed by the Dutch assault and was pushed back, and Leopold took command of a small force that defended the outskirts of Brussels. Leopold once again appealed to the French for support. The French promised support, and the arrival of their &quot;&quot; in Belgium forced the Dutch to retreat. Great Britain refused to intervene. Eventually, the Netherlands accepted a diplomatic mediation and returned behind to the pre-war border. Skirmishes continued for eight years, but in April 1839, the two countries signed the Treaty of London, whereby the Dutch finally recognised Belgium&#x27;s independence.
Leopold&#x27;s attitude during the war earned him both praise and criticism in the Belgian media. For example, an article in &quot;L&#x27;Indépendance Belge&quot; read, &quot;The King of the Belgians, [...] showed rare composure and intrepidity. Always in the most perilous places, he was often obliged to fulfill both the functions of generalissimo and those of second lieutenant.&quot; However, an article the following day critiqued, &quot;The approach of our troops repaired everything, but what is less repairable is the failure that the Belgians suffered in the opinion of Europe.&quot; Following the war and large losses that Belgium suffered, Leopold reorganised national defence, disbanded the &quot;Garde Civique&quot; and legislated the army&#x27;s numbers at 80,000 men. When the Dutch abandoned Belgium, they left a garrison force that closed the Scheldt to Belgian shipping, meaning that the port of Antwerp was effectively useless. The Netherlands and the Dutch colonies in particular, which had been profitable markets for Belgian manufacturers before 1830, became totally closed to Belgian goods. The French Army of the North, which had helped Belgium considerably in the Ten Days&#x27; Campaign, defeated the Dutch army the following year and lifted the siege of Antwerp on 15 November 1832. However, the Dutch managed to burn down much of the city before its liberation, and subsequent fighting remained until the Netherlands was finally defeated on 23 December 1832. The Dutch government continued to refuse to recognise the Treaty of the Eighteen Articles and William I of the Netherlands organised in May 1833 an embargo of Dutch coasts. Belgian, British and Dutch delegations subsequently met in Zonhoven to resolve the matters, but Leopold left unsatisfied as no agreements were definitively made.

In April 1834, anti-orangist riots broke out in Brussels and soon developed into protests in favour of Leopold. Several of the former residences of William&#x27;s family in Belgium and hotels in Brussels were ransacked, leading to Leopold travelling in on horseback and convincing the protestors to disband by giving a speech. Leopold&#x27;s advisors believed that peace had been restored and suggested he left, but soon after the Hotel of Trazegnies was also ransacked and the military were sent in. Over 115 people were arrested and seven were wounded, before the Belgian legislature passes a law that would punish pro-Orangist propaganda. Subsequently, Leopold took charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to deal with diplomatic clashes with the Netherlands, including the matter of Belgian claims to Dutch Limburg, which Leopold was unable to obtain, thus ruining his prospect for a new railway line through the region. He was successful however in reducing the country&#x27;s debt to the Netherlands from 8,400,000 to 5,400,000 florins. The Netherlands would finally go on to recognise Belgian independence by signing the Treaty of London in 1839. The Belgio-Dutch border was agreed to on 8 August 1843 with the Treaty of Maastricht.

Leopold was generally unsatisfied with the amount of power allocated to the monarch in the Constitution, and sought to extend it wherever the Constitution was ambiguous or unclear while generally avoiding involvement in routine politics.

===Marriage, family and residences===

Though Leopold was now monarch, due to his widowed status, there was concern over the issue of dynastic succession with Leopold having no issue. To strengthen ties with France, Leopold considered marrying a French princess and approached the King of the French, Louis Philippe I, who agreed to Leopold marrying his daughter, Louise of Orléans. They married on 9 August 1832 at the Château de Compiègne and participated in a civil ceremony, a Catholic service and a Lutheran blessing. Although the marriage was arranged, author Patrick Roegiers writes that the pair found happiness in each other. Soon after their wedding, Leopold asked the government if Louise could be appointed regent while he travelled, but they unanimously opposed. Leopold and Louise gave birth to their first son, Louis Philippe, on 24 July 1833, however the infant died nine months later on 16 May 1834 from an inflammation of mucous membranes. Two years later, on 9 April 1835, Louise gave birth to a second son, Leopold. Two more children, Philippe and Charlotte, followed on 24 March 1837 and 7 June 1840 respectively.

Of his three royal residences, the Royal Palace of Antwerp, the Royal Palace of Brussels and the Castle of Laeken, Leopold chose the latter as it reminded him of his erstwhile British residence, Claremont House. There, Leopold and Louise lived a generally relaxed and quiet life, with Louise stating that &quot;The King, his dog and I&quot; only lived there. According to Bronne, they would wake up mid-morning, attend mass and then read through their mail, which was sent in from Paris. Louise was often excited to read Parisian mail as it often came from her own family. When receiving politicians, officials and members of Belgian aristocracy, Leopold would often engage in cue sports.

In 1844, Leopold met Arcadie Claret, the eighteen-year-old daughter of an officer in the Belgian army. They very soon after had an affair and Leopold encouraged her to marry to avoid being caught out. Claret married Ferdinand Meyer in 1845, who managed the royal stables and agreed to be her husband in return for financial compensation. However, Meyer soon left for Coburg to allow Leopold and Claret to continue their relationship. Claret was placed in a house near the Royal Palace of Brussels and was discovered as Leopold&#x27;s mistress by the media, who also highlights Louise&#x27;s declining health. Claret&#x27;s house was attacked by the public for her use of palace carriages when going out. Leopold, per his advisors, encouraged Claret to have more restraint when travelling, but she left Belgium for Germany in October 1850. She eventually returned to Belgium and moved into Château of Stuyvenberg. Leopold had two illegitimate sons, George and Arthur, by Claret. was born in 1849, and in 1852. At Leopold&#x27;s request, in 1862 his two sons were created Freiherr von Eppinghoven by his nephew, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1863, Claret was also created Baronin von Eppinghoven.

===Domestic policy, politics and infrastructure===
While the drafters of the Belgian Constitution aimed to make Belgium a constitutional monarchy, making the monarch a neutral and impartial arbiter, Leopold had managed to assign himself significant powers, such as assuming multiple ministries and taking charge of many diplomatic, administrative and military domains. From 1831 to 1846, politics in Belgium was divided between Liberal and Catholic parties, along with unionist governments. Catholicism had always been the dominant religion in Belgium, yet Leopold had always refused to convert from his Lutheran faith and favoured the Liberals. To appease to the public, he sought to maintain cordial relations with the Holy See, though historian Louis de Lichtervelde suggests it may have been to reassure and consolidate his own power against &quot;the only other force [Catholicism]&quot; that had more popularity of him. Leopold also believed that the Church would act as a means of unity for Belgium, which was linguistically divided.
Historians believe that the fall of the Theux government in April 1840 was feared by Leopold as it was it marked the first time in modern Belgian history, and under his reign, that a government had collapsed. Leopold was opposed to Lebeau forming government as his party had voted against Barthélémy de Theux de Meylandt, which caused the government&#x27;s collapse. In 1846, the Party for Freedom and Progress convened to strengthen the cooperation between the executive and legislature, and as a result of new Bills passed by Charles Rogier&#x27;s government, the role of the monarch was reduced and Liberals dominated politics, advocating for free trade, freedoms, liberties and secularisation. During the second half of Leopold&#x27;s reign, the Liberals remained in power. While meeting with the government, Leopold made it clear that he believed the appointment and dismissal of ministers was his prerogative per the Constitution, and demanded that he be informed in advance of all government, ministerial and administrative decisions.

Throughout Leopold&#x27;s reign, Belgium experienced economic and industrial progress, despite economic crises during the early decades of his reign. The period between 1845 and 1849 was particularly hard in Flanders, where harvests failed and a third of the population became dependent on poor relief, and have been described as the &quot;worst years of Flemish history&quot;. The economic situation in Flanders also increased the internal migration to Brussels and the industrial areas of Wallonia, which continued throughout the period. Despite this, Leopold worked closely with the government to develop infrastructure, to which he promised in his enthronement speech: &quot;Multiple efforts will be directed towards the improvement and extension of agriculture, commerce and industry; they contribute to spreading prosperity among the various classes of inhabitants and to cementing harmony.&quot; In 1842, Leopold failed to pass laws to regulate child and women labour. He wanted to ban them from working in certain industries, such as harvesting in which he believe they dominated, however the Bill he proposed was defeated and child labour continued to be abused. For example, in 1850, the coal industry employed nearly 3300 women, 4400 boys and 1221 girls under the age of sixteen in underground labour. In agriculture, similar statistics existed with harsh working conditions and low wages. An investigation was conducted in 1853 and 1854 by journalist Édouard Ducpétiaux found that the average Belgian worker had to devote 65.8% of their wage to basic needs. The issue of low wages was never recognised or tended to by Leopold.

The opening of the first railway line connecting Belgium to continental Europe was promoted by Leopold. He was an early supporter of railways, and Belgium&#x27;s first stretch of railway, between northern Brussels and Mechelen, was completed in 1835. When completed, it was one of the first passenger railways on the continent. The development of railways allowed for the growth of the industry and in an 1847 speech, Leopold remarked: &quot;Freight transport and railway revenues continue to increase at a remarkable rate. Measures are being prepared to increase them further and to introduce improvements in the operation of this important service.&quot; Multiple historians attribute the development and production of cast iron, steel, coal, glassworks and cloth weaving to Leopold&#x27;s reign. Earlier in 1835, Leopold had inaugurated the National Bank of Belgium, which solidified the 1832 creation and circulation of the Belgian franc. Leopold appeared on coinage and postage stamps, which had helped to congeal the legitimacy of his reign in the early years.

===Revolution of 1848===

In 1848, protests plagued the majority of Europe. The success of economic reforms partially mitigated the effects of the economic downturn and meant that Belgium was not as badly affected as its neighbours by the Revolutions of 1848. Nevertheless, in early 1848, a large number of radical publications appeared. The most serious threat of the 1848 revolutions in Belgium was posed by Belgian émigré groups. Shortly after the French Revolution of 1848, Belgian migrant workers living in Paris were encouraged to return to Belgium to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. Around 6000 armed émigrés of the &quot;Belgian Legion&quot; attempted to cross the Belgian frontier. The first group, travelling by train, was stopped and quickly disarmed at Quiévrain on 26 March 1848. The second group crossed the border on 29 March and headed for Brussels. They were confronted by Belgian troops at the hamlet of Risquons-Tout and, during fighting, seven émigrés were killed and most of the rest were captured.

In order to defuse tension, the government adopted multiple measured aimed at liberalising the country and preventing it from being attacked by revolutionary ideas of its neighbours. For example, the stamp duty on newspapers was abolished and agents who the state believed could serve as potential disturbances to public order, such as Karl Marx, were expelled from Belgium in March. Ultimately, Leopold theatrically offered his abdication, if this was the wish of the majority of his people. Historians such as Stengers and Éliane Gubin claim that it was the first time in his life that Leopold regretted not taking up the offer of the Greek throne. The defeat at Risquons-Tout effectively ended the revolutionary threat to Belgium, as the situation in Belgium began to recover that summer after a good harvest, and fresh elections returned a strong Liberal majority. At the end of 1848, Leopold commented on the situation: &quot;You know this country which, I can say without false modesty, has been administered in an exemplary manner for almost 18 years. It proved itself well during the crisis and despite the terrible neighborhood of Paris. [...] After this trial by fire, the country became very solid [...], I gained the trust of most of the Cabinets and also of the people; I intend to use it and use it to the full for the benefit of Europe.&quot;

===Foreign policy===
====Role in European affairs====

For his role in European affairs, Leopold was dubbed the &quot;Nestor of Europe&quot;, after the wise mediator in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. This was also due to his connection to other monarchs. For example, Leopold&#x27;s niece was Queen of Great Britain, his nephew was Prince Consort of Great Britain and his nephew was the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He remained in close contact with his sovereign relatives, particularly Queen Victoria. Historian Jean Stengers records that Leopold&#x27;s intervention in European affairs was to look after Belgian interests, to look after British interests and to encourage peace to maintain the conservative order. Not only did Leopold have high correspondence with other leaders, but he regularly travelled and made informal and state visits. Throughout his reign and particularly in the 1840s, a main goal of his was to repair Franco-British relations due to the Eastern question. He organised a meeting between his father-in-law, Louis Philippe I of France, and his niece, Queen Victoria, in 1843 at the Château d&#x27;Eu, marking the first time in thirteen years that the House of Orléans received a foreign monarch. The following year, Louis Philippe visited Victoria in Britain, with Leopold and Louise organising his itinerary. Moreover, with the rise of Prussia to the east of Belgium, Leopold worked to maintain amicable ties with the German states. In August 1843, along with members of the British royal family, Leopold travelled to Brühl and stayed at Stolzenfels Castle with the Prussian monarch and forty members of other German royalty. Notably, the Emperor of Russia, Nicholas I, did not attend despite his invite. In 1844, per Jules Van Praet, Russia and Belgium established relations.

The rise of Prussia as the dominating German power continued to occur throughout the decades of Leopold&#x27;s reign. The new German Confederation&#x27;s legislature became the Frankfurt Assembly, which was the first pan-German parliament with representatives from each German state, including the German-speaking areas of the Austrian Empire. Leopold&#x27;s name was suggested as a potential candidate for the federal leader of the Confederation who would bear the imperial crown of Germany. Naturally, the entry of Belgium into the German Confederation was then discussed. Leopold was opposed to both of these propositions as it was contravene Belgium&#x27;s status as a neutral power and would diminish the independence of the country. The German Confederation nonetheless soon disbanded, though German Unification would later occur after Leopold&#x27;s death.

When Louis Philippe was deposed in the 1848 French Revolution, Leopold remained neutral and was one of the first heads of state to recognise the new French Republic. While this pleased the new French government, it came as a shock to other European nations who had admired Belgian neutrality, imposed by Article VII of the Treaty of London (1839). While most historians have depicted Leopold as faithful to this, others have not, such as Belgian historian Jan Anckaer, who interprets Leopold&#x27;s diplomatic efforts in the Second Egyptian-Ottoman War in 1840 and Belgium&#x27;s manufacture of arms for Russia during the Crimean War as breaches of neutrality. Following the July Monarchy, the Second French Empire was ignited, which worried the Belgian government. Immediately following the 1851 French coup d&#x27;état, Leopold sent Prime Minister Henri de Brouckère to Paris to meet the new Napoleon III to assure cordial relations. Leopold saw the new regime in France as a threat and began limiting the number of French political refugees to maintain on the good side of Napoleon, who Leopold met in Calais in 1854. The following year, Leopold sent his eldest son to Paris for an exhibition as the official Belgian delegation.

Furthermore, despite initial skirmishes at the start of his tenure, Leopold wanted to repair relations with the Netherlands. In October 1859, Leopold sent his youngest son to The Hague on a state visit, where he met with the Dutch royal family. On 18 October 1861 in Liège, Leopold received William III of the Netherlands, who returned via Belgium after meeting with Napoleon III. The day before the Belgian and Dutch monarchs met, Leopold wrote to Victoria: &quot;He will be very well received, his process is rightly appreciated here. Being received in the very country where you were Crown Prince is a little painful and you feel slightly embarrassed.&quot; The meeting is successful.

====Role in colonial affairs====
When Leopold swore allegiance to the Constitution, Belgium had no colonial possessions and could not lay claim to any Dutch colonies. However, Belgium did seek to develop its industry and trade, which it saw would require establishing commercial relations with non-European countries. Leopold also believed that acquiring a colony would solve the issue of rising poverty rates, a cause of rapid industrialisation and food shortages following war with the Netherlands. In attempting to set up colonies, Leopold engaged in multiple planning projects which he personally funded, however they were all abandoned by the government. He proposed taking the Isle of Pines, Tortuga and other territories in the Antilles. Sweden made Belgium an offer to cede the island of Saint Barthélemy, but France soon took it up. Other colonial prospects of Leopold&#x27;s that resulted in failure included taking the Faroe Islands, setting up a Belgian protectorate in New Zealand, installing a Belgian trading post in Abyssinia, taking the Nicobar Islands per an English shipping company&#x27;s suggestion, and establishing a consortium in the Philippines that would pay Spain at 5% interest.

The Belgian Colonisation Company was founded on 18 September 1841 and was funded by Leopold. Its objectives were to &quot;create agricultural, industrial and commercial establishments in different states of Central America and other places&quot; and &quot;to establish commercial relations between these countries and Belgium&quot;. The company purchased 404,666 hectares of land in Santo Tomás de Castilla, present-day Guatemala, granted by Guatemalan dictator Rafael Carrera. An exploration commission was sent on 9 November 1841 in order to finalise the purchase, however Belgian delegates soon began leaving due to unsanitary conditions, though Leopold pushed for the project to continue. Until 1847, Belgium sent ships full of settlers, served prisoners and working-class men to the territory, promising a more hopeful future, however this failed due to harsh conditions leading to a high mortality rate. In 1855, Guatemala pulled out from the deal.

Later, in 1859, Great Britain and France sent expeditionary forces to China, bound for Beijing. Under Leopold&#x27;s eldest son, Leopold, who held an interest in the Far East, Belgium sought to involve itself by sending volunteers so that the country would economically benefit and strengthen ties with Britain and France. Napoleon III was contacted by the Belgian monarch, and the two agreed to Belgian involvement, however the government stated that it would pull out if conflict were to occur. In 1860, Leopold sent his youngest son, Philip, to Brazil so that he could marry one of the daughters of the Emperor of Brazil, Pedro II. Pedro subsequently gifted Philip with multiple territories for European migrants to settle on. Leopold was eager for the marriage to work as it would establish a branch of his family in South America. However, Philip was unimpressed and abandoned the project. By the end of Leopold&#x27;s reign, Belgium still lacked colonies, however his son would soon acquire the Congo as his own personal private property, before it would secede to Belgium.

====Role in family affairs and the death of Louise====

As a member of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Leopold was eager to his family&#x27;s influence rise throughout Europe. He skillfully used his family connections and marriages to protect Belgium from French ambitions and the threat of annexation by Napoleon III. Leopold supported the marriage of his nephew, Ferdinand, to the Queen of Portugal, Maria II, in 1836. Portugal had a longstanding alliance with Great Britain and with his nephew now on the Portuguese throne &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, Leopold hoped it would bring Belgium and Britain closer. In 1840, Leopold&#x27;s nephew, Albert, married his first cousin and Leopold&#x27;s niece, Queen Victoria, thus cementing Anglo-Belgian ties. In 1843, Leopold&#x27;s nephew, Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, married Louise&#x27;s sister, Princess Clémentine of Orléans, thus again uniting the two royal houses. Though Leopold had influenced all these royal marriages, he was not always as successful. In 1846, August&#x27;s brother, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, failed to marry Isabella II of Spain.

Meanwhile, in France in 1850, Louise had caught a cold while attending a ceremony commemorating her recently deceased father. Though medical experts did not seem concerned, Louise died prematurely on 11 October 1850, aged 38. It was the second time Leopold was widowed and he became deeply saddened by this.

Per Defrance, the mood in the royal court fell sombre dramatically after this. Leopold and Louise&#x27;s children, who were barely teenagers, suffered in the absence of their mother and were often left to nannys. Louise had personally educated her children and now tutors needed to be found. Leopold became more reclusive and distanced from his family, with it becoming normal for their only form of communication to be by letter, either in French or German. Leopold found comfort in Louise&#x27;s friend and his daughter&#x27;s tutor, Countess Denise d&#x27;Hulst, and he attempted to father his two sons, who began regularly rebelling against him.

As his children aged, Leopold was gladdened to see his eldest son and daughter marry into the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, who served as the Emperors of Austria and previously of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1853, Leopold&#x27;s eldest son married Marie Henriette of Austria, a first cousin of Emperor Franz Joseph I. Four years later, Leopold encouraged the matrimonial pairing of his daughter, Charlotte, with Archduke Maximilian of Austria, who was later appointed the Emperor of Mexico. Additionally, Leopold&#x27;s great-nephew, Edward, Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII), married Alexandra of Denmark in 1862 under the auspices of Leopold. Edward&#x27;s mother, Queen Victoria, continued Leopold&#x27;s legacy of arranging royal marriages for the family, becoming nicknamed the &quot;grandmother of Europe&quot;. However, Leopold&#x27;s role in Belgian diplomacy diminished in favour of the government in the later years of his reign. In 1859, he failed to convince his Cabinet to send a Belgian brigade to support Anglo-French naval troops in China, and in 1863, he played little role in negotiations concerning the purchase of the Scheldt toll.

===Later reign===
====Silver Jubilee====

In Summer 1856, Leopold celebrated his Silver Jubilee, celebrating 25 years of his reign and since the inauguration of the first King of the Belgians. On 21 July 1856, Leopold travelled on horseback on the same route that he had taken when he first arrived in Belgium, through Laeken and then to the Royal Palace of Brussels. His two sons also travel with him, and he attended a Te Deum of gratitude in his honour. While Leopold had become more recluse as his reign continued, he was delighted with his jubilee and made many appearances. In the following months of the anniversary, Leopold and his sons visit each province of the country, where they stay at each capital and attend processions, balls, banquets, Church services and factory tours. Stockmar, who was in retirement in Coburg, wrote in his diary his surprise of the use of the Dutch language during the tour.

The following year, Belgium faced political crisis when Catholic Prime Minister Pierre de Decker introduced a new Bill into Parliament which he believed would act as a unifying force between the Catholics and the Liberals. For 27 parliamentary sessions, the Bill is debated as it was deemed controversial by the shadow ministry and Opposition. Protests by the public against the Bill soon broke out in the capital cities and demonstrators surrounded the Palace of the Nation. On 28 May, Leopold called in troops to calm the protests and angrily declared: &quot;I will ride on horseback if necessary to protect the national representation; I will not allow the majority to be outraged; I will crush these scoundrels.&quot; As rioting continued, Leopold suggested that the articles in the Bill be separated, but de Decker denounced him and soon abandoned it completely. Leopold sent him a letter, which was published in the &quot;Moniteur&quot;, in which he criticised the government and wrote: &quot;It was not I who abandoned them in 1857, it was they who abandoned me. I was ready to ride a horse, I wouldn&#x27;t have backed down. They left me in the presence of disorder; they reduced me to giving in to disorder and no one could understand how profound such humiliation was.&quot;

On 9 November 1857, after de Decker resigned and the government fell, Rogier returned to office and formed a Liberal government, which lasted for ten years and went on to outlive Leopold. Rogier also held the position of Minister of the Interior, with parliamentarians Walthère Frère-Orban and Victor Tesch assuming other different ministries. This new government acted by the Constitution, but took an anticlerical attitude due to the protests. In 1861, the government introduced new legislation regarded scholarships, which took funding away from Catholic cemeteries as a punishment for the previous government who had done the same for atheist cemeteries. Leopold was strongly against these anti-religious stances taken by Rogier&#x27;s Cabinet, but remained impartial per his constitutional role as a neutral figurehead, though he did threaten to override new changes if it was made clear they were not the will of the majority. However, after 1857, Leopold&#x27;s main concern for Belgium is its defence and he was glad when Antwerp was chosen as the future development site of the National Redoubt.

In 1859, a statue of Leopold was erected at the top of the Congress Column to mark his earlier Silver Jubilee. On 12 June, Leopold is also delighted by the birth of his first grandson, Prince Leopold. Furthermore, in 1860, Leopold again visited each provincial capital city despite being ill and his declining health. Upon his return to Brussels in September 1860, Leopold decided to no longer preside over the Council of Ministers and to roll back on his other duties due to his aging condition. Additionally, all of Leopold&#x27;s mail was now read by and responded to by Van Praet, instead of by Leopold directly.

====Interests in the Americas====
Unlike Leopold&#x27;s elder son, Leopold&#x27;s daughter, Charlotte, personally chose her husband of Archduke Maximilian, the younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I. Leopold preferred that she married his great-nephew, Peter V of Portugal, but did not oppose her decision. A few weeks after their wedding, in September 1857, Maximilian was appointed Viceroy of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. During the Austro-Sardinian War, Leopold gave unwanted strategic advice to Franz Joseph, who mocked and did not follow it. When Austria lost Lombardy, Leopold advised Prussia to assemble an army on the Rhine, which was seen as Leopold taking the Prussian side in the Austro-Prussian rivalry.
In 1861, the American Civil War commenced and despite Belgian neutrality, Leopold was in favour of the Confederate States due to economic the United States Union&#x27;s imposition of economic blockades, including the refusal to export South American goods to Europe. According to historian Francis Balace, Leopold played an important role as a mediator between the United States and the rest of Europe, as well as in convincing other European states to back the South. In contrast, historian Jacques Portes has downplayed the significance of Leopold&#x27;s role by painting him as an ineffective transmitter of correspondence between the two sides with little care for Belgium&#x27;s impartiality.
In Mexico, President Benito Juárez suspended the country&#x27;s payment of its foreign debt in July 1861, to the displeasure of Great Britain, France and Spain. Napoleon III took it as an opportunity to intervene in Mexico, aiming to spread Catholicism and the influence of the United States in the Americas. He offered the imperial crown of Mexico to Maximilian as an apology to Austria for earlier siding with Sardinia. Much to the delight of Leopold, Maximilian accepted and left Austria with Charlotte for Mexico, arriving in Mexico City on 12 June 1864 despite armed opposition from republicans. Leopold encouraged the sending of a Belgian Legion, composed of 4000 male volunteers, to support his daughter. The Legion was badly defeated by republican forces at the Battle of Tacámbaro in April 1865, but was victorious in July under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred van der Smissen. When the American Civil War ended, the United States government signalled its support for Juárez. Maximilian and Charlotte asked Leopold for some advice, but the helpless aging monarch merely replied, &quot;God bless you, I can no longer help you.&quot; The strong Mexican resistance and failure to push back against it led to Napoleon III abandoning Mexico on 15 January 1866. Charlotte escaped Mexico in July to get assistance from European states, who ignored her and left Maximilian, who refused to abdicate and was later executed on 18 June 1867.

====Final years====
Until the age of 70, Leopold endured relatively good health. However, in 1861, he faced several problems that severely affected him. His sister, Princess Victoria, died in March and his great-nephew, Peter V, aged 24, died of typhoid fever in November, only weeks before his brother, Infante João, Duke of Beja, also died. Additionally, his nephew, Albert, died in December. Leopold attended his funeral to support his niece, Queen Victoria, and during this time suffered from kidney stones. Leopold underwent a lithotripsy in the following March and many more in the subsequent months. Despite his health issues, Leopold was still able to engage in leisure activities, such as hunting, however he suffered a stroke at the beginning of 1865. His health continued to decline for the remainder of the year.

==Death and funeral==

On 23 November 1865, Leopold was urgently brought back from the Royal Château of Ardenne to Laeken due to health issues. He signed multiple royal decrees to hide his declining health, which was leaked to the public by the &quot;Moniteur&quot; on 2 December. Confined to his bed, Leopold summoned a pianist to play him the overture to &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, as he was diagnosed with dysentery and had mobility struggles. On 9 December, Leopold was expected to die, however he survived the night, and he was visited by his daughter-in-law, Marie Henriette of Austria, who knelt by his side and exchanged words with him. She convinced him to allow his family to visit, which they swiftly did, along with his personal chaplain, Pastor Frederick William Becker. Leopold said in their presence, &quot;Forgive me, my God, forgive me.&quot; Holding his daughter-in-law&#x27;s hand, Leopold died on 10 December 1865 at 11:45 am at the age of 74. He was succeeded by his 30-year-old son, the new King Leopold II, who would reign until 1909.

Leopold&#x27;s state funeral was held on 16 December 1865. He was initially buried next to his wife in the Saint Barbara Chapel of the Notre-Dame de Laeken. On 20 April 1876, he and Louise&#x27;s remains were moved to the Royal Crypt in the Church of Our Lady of Laeken. Over 500,000 people watched Leopold&#x27;s funeral procession on 16 December 1865. Many members of European royalty were in attendance, including the Belgian royal family, Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, Luís I of Portugal, Archduke Joseph Karl of Austria, Louis III, Grand Duke of Hesse, Leopold, Hereditary Prince of Hohenzollern, Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours, Prince Henri, Duke of Aumale, François d&#x27;Orléans, Prince of Joinville, Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau, Frederick, Prince Royal of Prussia (later Frederick III), Prince Adalbert of Prussia, Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden, Prince George of Saxony (later George I) and Charles I of Württemberg. Diplomats from France, Russia and the Ottoman Empire were also in attendance. Due to Leopold&#x27;s Protestant faith, a Protestant version of the Church of Our Lady of Laeken was quickly built opposite Saint Barbara Chapel for the funeral. Leopold&#x27;s coffin was placed in an ebony chest laced with gold, which was sealed by Tesch, the Minister of Justice.

==Legacy==
===In memoriam===
Belgian National Day is celebrated annually to mark the anniversary of Leopold&#x27;s pledge to the Constitution, oath and installation as King of the Belgians. Several monuments have been dedicated in Leopold&#x27;s honour. The Monument to the Dynasty was erected in Brussels at the initiative of Leopold II. Other monuments built include his statue on top of the Congress Column in 1859, a monument in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, at the request of Queen Victoria in 1867, the Equestrian Statue of Leopold I in Leopold Square in Antwerp in 1872, the Monument to Leopold I in Mons in 1877, the Monument to Leopold I in the Park of Laeken in 1880, the Equestrian Statue of Leopold I in Ostend in 1901, and the Monument to Leopold I in La Panne in 1958. Additionally, several Belgian naval vessels have been named in his honour, including the &quot;Leopold I&quot;, a frigate acquired by Belgium in 2007. His monogram features on the flag of the Flemish town of Leopoldsburg. His likeness has also appeared on postage stamps and commemorative coins issued since his death.

<doc id="56472" wikidata="Q43723" url="?curid=56472" title="Benjamin Netanyahu">
<text>Benjamin Netanyahu (born 21 October 1949) is an Israeli politician who has been serving as the prime minister of Israel since 2022, having previously held the office from 1996 to 1999 and from 2009 to 2021. Netanyahu is the longest-serving prime minister in Israel&#x27;s history, having served a total of over 17 years.

Born to secular Jewish parents, Netanyahu was raised in West Jerusalem and the United States. He returned to Israel in 1967 to join the Israel Defense Forces and served in the Sayeret Matkal special forces as a captain before being honorably discharged. In 1972, he returned to the United States, and after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Netanyahu worked for the Boston Consulting Group before moving back to Israel in 1978 to found the Yonatan Netanyahu Anti-Terror Institute. Between 1984 and 1988 Netanyahu was Israel&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations. Netanyahu rose to prominence after election as chair of Likud in 1993, becoming leader of the opposition. In the 1996 general election, Netanyahu became the first Israeli prime minister elected directly by popular vote, and its youngest. Netanyahu was defeated in the 1999 election and retired from politics, entering the private sector. He returned and served as minister of foreign affairs and finance, initiating economic reforms, before resigning over the Gaza disengagement plan.

Netanyahu returned to lead Likud in 2005 and was leader of the opposition between 2006 and 2009. After the 2009 legislative election, Netanyahu formed a coalition with other right-wing parties and became prime minister again. He led Likud to victory in the 2013 and 2015 elections. Netanyahu made his closeness to Donald Trump, a friend since the 1980s, central to his appeal from 2016. During Trump&#x27;s first presidency, the US recognized Jerusalem as capital of Israel, Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and brokered the Abraham Accords, normalization agreements between Israel and the Arab world. Netanyahu has faced criticism over expanding Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, deemed illegal under international law. In 2019, Netanyahu was indicted on charges of breach of trust, bribery and fraud, and relinquished all ministerial posts except prime minister. The 2018–2022 Israeli political crisis led to a rotation agreement between Netanyahu and Benny Gantz. This collapsed in 2020, leading to a March 2021 election. In June 2021, Netanyahu was removed from the premiership, before returning after the 2022 election.

Netanyahu&#x27;s coalition pursued judicial reform, which was met with large-scale protests in early 2023. The 7 October attacks by Hamas-led Palestinian groups in the same year triggered the Gaza war, with Netanyahu facing nationwide protests for the security lapse during the attack and failure to secure the return of Israeli hostages. In October 2024, he also ordered an invasion of Lebanon with the stated goal of destroying the military capabilities of Hezbollah, a key ally of Hamas that helped them since the 7 October attack. After the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024, Netanyahu directed an invasion of Syria against the Syrian opposition. Netanyahu&#x27;s government has been accused of genocide in Gaza, culminating in the &quot;South Africa v. Israel&quot; case before the International Court of Justice in December 2023. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant in November 2024 for Netanyahu along with former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas militant Mohammed Deif, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity as part of the ICC investigation in Palestine.

== Early life and military career ==

Netanyahu was born in 1949 in Tel Aviv. His mother, Tzila Segal (1912–2000), was born in Petah Tikva in the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, and his father, Warsaw-born Benzion Netanyahu (né Mileikowsky; 1910–2012), was a historian specializing in the Jewish Golden age of Spain. His paternal grandfather, Nathan Mileikowsky, was a rabbi and Zionist writer. When Netanyahu&#x27;s father immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, he hebraized his surname from &quot;Mileikowsky&quot; to &quot;Netanyahu&quot;, meaning &quot;God has given.&quot; While his family is predominantly Ashkenazi, he has said that a DNA test revealed him to have some Sephardic ancestry. He claims descent from the Vilna Gaon.

Netanyahu was the second of three children. He was initially raised and educated in Jerusalem, where he attended Henrietta Szold Elementary School. A copy of his evaluation from his 6th grade teacher Ruth Rubenstein indicated that Netanyahu was courteous, polite, and helpful; that he was &quot;responsible and punctual&quot;; and that he was friendly, disciplined, cheerful, brave, active, and obedient.

Between 1956 and 1958, and again from 1963 to 1967, his family lived in the United States in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, while father Benzion Netanyahu taught at Dropsie College.
Benjamin attended and graduated from Cheltenham High School and was active in the debate club, chess club, and soccer. He and his brother Yonatan grew dissatisfied with what they saw as the superficial way of life they encountered in the area, including the prevalent youth counterculture movement and the liberal sensibilities of the Reform synagogue, Temple Judea of Philadelphia, that the family attended.

After graduating from high school in 1967, Netanyahu returned to Israel to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces. He trained as a combat soldier and served for five years in a special forces unit of the IDF, Sayeret Matkal. He took part in numerous cross-border raids during the 1967–70 War of Attrition, including the March 1968 Battle of Karameh, when the IDF attacked Jordan to capture PLO leader Yasser Arafat but were repulsed with heavy casualties, rising to become a team-leader in the unit. He was wounded in combat on multiple occasions. He was involved in many other missions, including the 1968 Israeli raid on Lebanon and the rescue of the hijacked Sabena Flight 571 in May 1972, in which he was shot in the shoulder. He was discharged from active service in 1972 but remained in the Sayeret Matkal reserves. Following his discharge, he left to study in the United States but returned in October 1973 to serve in the Yom Kippur War. He took part in special forces raids along the Suez Canal against Egyptian forces before leading a commando attack deep inside Syrian territory, the details of which remain classified today.

=== Education ===

Netanyahu returned to the United States in late 1972 to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After briefly returning to Israel to fight in the Yom Kippur War, he returned to the United States and, under the name Ben Nitay, completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture in February 1975 and earned a master&#x27;s degree from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1976. Concurrently, he was studying towards a doctorate in political science, until his studies were broken off by the death of his brother in the Entebbe raid.

At MIT, Netanyahu studied a double-load while simultaneously taking courses at Harvard University, completing his bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture in two and a half years, despite taking a break to fight in the Yom Kippur War. Professor Leon B. Groisser at MIT recalled: &quot;He did superbly. He was very bright. Organized. Strong. Powerful. He knew what he wanted to do and how to get it done.&quot;

At that time he changed his name to Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Nitai (Nitai, a reference to both Mount Nitai and to the eponymous Jewish sage Nittai of Arbela, was a pen name often used by his father for articles). Years later, in an interview with the media, Netanyahu clarified that he decided to do so to make it easier for Americans to pronounce his name. This fact has been used by his political rivals to accuse him indirectly of a lack of Israeli national identity and loyalty.

In 1976, Netanyahu&#x27;s older brother Yonatan Netanyahu was killed. Yonatan was serving as the commander of Benjamin&#x27;s former unit, the Sayeret Matkal, and died during the counter-terrorism hostage-rescue mission Operation Thunderbolt in which his unit rescued more than 100 mostly Israeli hostages hijacked by terrorists and flown to the Entebbe Airport in Uganda.

==Early career==
Netanyahu was headhunted to be an economic consultant for the Boston Consulting Group in Boston, Massachusetts, working at the company between 1976 and 1978. At the Boston Consulting Group, he was a colleague of Mitt Romney, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. Romney described Netanyahu at the time as &quot;a strong personality with a distinct point of view&quot;, and said, &quot;We can almost speak in shorthand... [w]e share common experiences and have a perspective and underpinning which is similar.&quot; Netanyahu said that their &quot;easy communication&quot; was a result of &quot;B.C.G.&#x27;s intellectually rigorous boot camp&quot;.

In 1978, Netanyahu appeared on Boston local television, under the name &quot;Ben Nitai&quot;, where he argued: &quot;The real core of the conflict is the unfortunate Arab refusal to accept the State of Israel... For 20 years the Arabs had both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and if self-determination, as they now say, is the core of the conflict, they could have easily established a Palestinian state.&quot;
In 1978, Netanyahu returned to Israel. Between 1978 and 1980, he ran the Jonathan Netanyahu Anti-Terror Institute, a non-governmental organization devoted to the study of terrorism; the Institute held a number of international conferences focused on the discussion of international terrorism. From 1980 to 1982, he was director of marketing for Rim Industries in Jerusalem. During this period Netanyahu made his first connections with several Israeli politicians, including Minister Moshe Arens.

Arens appointed him as his Deputy Chief of Mission at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., while Arens was ambassador to the United States, a position he held from 1982 until 1984. During the 1982 Lebanon War, he was called up for reserve duty in Sayeret Matkal and requested to be released from service, preferring to remain in the US and serve as a spokesperson for Israel in the wake of harsh international criticism of the war. He presented Israel&#x27;s case to the media during the war and established a highly efficient public relations system in the Israeli embassy. Between 1984 and 1988, Netanyahu served as the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. Netanyahu was influenced by Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, with whom he formed a relationship during the 1980s. He referred to Schneerson as &quot;the most influential man of our time&quot;. At this time Netanyahu became friends with Fred Trump, the father of future U.S. President Donald Trump.

== Leader of the Opposition (1993–1996) ==
Prior to the 1988 Israeli legislative election, Netanyahu returned to Israel and joined the Likud party. In the Likud&#x27;s internal elections, Netanyahu was placed fifth on the party list. Later on he was elected as a Knesset member of the 12th Knesset, and was appointed as a deputy of the foreign minister Moshe Arens, and later on David Levy. Netanyahu and Levy did not cooperate and the rivalry between the two only intensified afterwards. During the Gulf War in early 1991, the English-fluent Netanyahu emerged as the principal spokesman for Israel in media interviews on CNN and other news outlets. During the Madrid Conference of 1991 Netanyahu was a member of the Israeli delegation headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. After the Madrid Conference Netanyahu was appointed as Deputy Minister in the Israeli Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

Following the defeat of the Likud party in the 1992 Israeli legislative elections the Likud party held a party leadership election in 1993, and Netanyahu was victorious, defeating Benny Begin, son of the late prime minister Menachem Begin, and veteran politician David Levy (Sharon initially sought Likud party leadership as well, but quickly withdrew when it was evident that he was attracting minimal support). Shamir retired from politics shortly after the Likud&#x27;s defeat in the 1992 elections.

Following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin at the end of a rally in support of the Oslo Accords, Rabin&#x27;s temporary successor Shimon Peres decided to call early elections in order to give the government a mandate to advance the peace process. Netanyahu was the Likud&#x27;s candidate for prime minister in the 1996 Israeli legislative election which took place on 29 May 1996 and were the first Israeli elections in which Israelis elected their prime minister directly. Netanyahu hired American Republican political operative Arthur Finkelstein to run his campaign, and although the American style of sound bites and sharp attacks elicited harsh criticism, Netanyahu won the 1996 election, becoming the youngest person in the history of the position and the first Israeli prime minister to be born in the State of Israel (Yitzhak Rabin was born in Jerusalem, under the British Mandate of Palestine, prior to the 1948 founding of the Israeli state).

Netanyahu&#x27;s victory over the pre-election favorite Shimon Peres surprised many. The main catalyst in the downfall of the latter was a wave of suicide bombings shortly before the elections; on 3 and 4 March 1996, Palestinians carried out two suicide bombings, killing 32 Israelis, with Peres seemingly unable to stop the attacks. During the campaign, Netanyahu stressed that progress in the peace process would be based on the Palestinian National Authority fulfilling its obligations – mainly fighting terrorism – and the Likud campaign slogan was, &quot;Netanyahu – making a safe peace&quot;. However, although Netanyahu won the election for prime minister, Peres&#x27;s Israeli Labor Party received more seats in the Knesset elections. Netanyahu had to rely on a coalition with the ultra-Orthodox parties, Shas and UTJ in order to form a government.

== Prime minister (1996–1999) ==

=== First term ===
A spate of suicide bombings reinforced the Likud position for security. Hamas claimed responsibility for most of the bombings. As prime minister, Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the Oslo Accords. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, and the amending of the Palestinian National Charter. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages. Netanyahu said that these concessions only gave encouragement to extremist elements, without receiving any tangible gestures in return. He called for tangible gestures of Palestinian goodwill in return for Israeli concessions. Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, Prime Minister Netanyahu continued their implementation, but his Premiership saw a marked slow-down in the peace process.

In 1996, Netanyahu and Jerusalem&#x27;s mayor Ehud Olmert decided to open an exit in the Arab Quarter for the Western Wall Tunnel, which prior prime minister Shimon Peres had instructed to be put on hold for the sake of peace. This sparked three days of rioting by Palestinians, resulting in dozens of both Israelis and Palestinians being killed.

Netanyahu first met Palestinian President Arafat on 4 September 1996. Prior to the meeting, the two leaders spoke by telephone. The meetings would continue through Autumn 1996. On their first meeting, Netanyahu said: &quot;I would like to emphasize that we have to take into account the needs and the requirements of both sides on the basis of reciprocity and the assurance of the security and well-being of both Israelis and Palestinian alike.&quot; Arafat said: &quot;We are determined to work with Mr. Netanyahu and with his government.&quot; The talks culminated on 14 January 1997, in the signing of the Hebron Protocol. The signing of the Hebron Protocol with the Palestinian Authority resulted in the redeployment of Israeli forces in Hebron and the turnover of civilian authority in much of the area to the control of the Palestinian Authority.
Eventually, the lack of progress of the peace process led to new negotiations which produced the Wye River Memorandum in 1998 which detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority to implement the earlier Interim Agreement of 1995. It was signed by Netanyahu and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, and on 17 November 1998, Israel&#x27;s 120 member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Wye River Memorandum by a vote of 75–19. In a nod to the 1967 Khartoum conference, Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized a policy of &quot;three no(s)&quot;: no withdrawal from the Golan Heights, no discussion of the case of Jerusalem, no negotiations under any preconditions.

In 1997, Netanyahu authorized a Mossad operation to assassinate Hamas leader Khaled Mashal in Jordan, just three years after the two countries had signed a peace treaty. The Mossad team, covering as five Canadian tourists, entered Jordan on 27 September 1997 and injected poison into Mashal&#x27;s ears in a street in Amman. The plot was exposed and two agents were arrested by the Jordanian police while three others hid in the Israeli embassy which was then surrounded by troops. An angry King Hussein demanded Israel to give out the antidote and threatened to annul the peace treaty. Netanyahu relented to the demands after pressure by US President Bill Clinton and ordered the release of 61 Jordanian and Palestinian prisoners including Sheikh Ahmad Yassin. The incident sent the nascent Israeli-Jordanian relations plummeting.

During his term, Netanyahu also began a process of economic liberalization, taking steps towards a free-market economy. Under his watch, the government began selling its shares in banks and major state-run companies. Netanyahu also greatly eased Israel&#x27;s strict foreign exchange controls, enabling Israelis to take an unrestricted amount of money out of the country, open foreign bank accounts, hold foreign currency, and invest freely in other countries.
Throughout his term, Netanyahu was opposed by the political left wing in Israel and lost support from the right because of his concessions to the Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere, and due to his negotiations with Arafat generally. Netanyahu lost favor with the Israeli public after a long chain of scandals involving his marriage and corruption charges. In 1997, police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges for influence-peddling. He was accused of appointing an attorney general who would reduce the charges but prosecutors ruled that there was insufficient evidence to go to trial. In 1999, Netanyahu faced another scandal when the Israel Police recommended that he be tried for corruption for $100,000 in free services from a government contractor; Israel&#x27;s attorney general did not prosecute, citing difficulties with evidence.

====Hamas and Hezbollah====
The months leading up to the 1996 Israeli election were marred by a series of Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. After the Shin Bet assassinated Hamas military leader Yahya Ayyash on 5 January 1996, Mohammed Deif, now commander of the Qassam Brigades, organized a mass-casualty bombing campaign inside Israel as retaliation, including the Dizengoff Center suicide bombing in Tel Aviv and the two Jaffa Road bus bombings in Jerusalem. These operations were, in their scale, scope and sophistication, different and larger than any attacks of the past, and it has been alleged that both Syria and Iran had helped in their planning and financing. According to a report, Syrian Minister of Defense Mustafa Tlass instructed Ghazi Kanaan, the commander of Syrian forces in Lebanon, to establish links between Hezbollah and Hamas fighters, who were then trained both in Lebanon and in Iran and participated in the retaliatory operations for the murder of Ayyash. According to Mike Kelly, Hamas operative Hassan Salameh, who planned three of the attacks, was trained in Iran. In 2000, families of American victims of the attacks filed a lawsuit against Tlass, Kanaan and Iranian Minister of Intelligence Ali Fallahian.

According to Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman, Deif&#x27;s campaign of massive retaliation and the failure of Israeli intelligence services to prevent it, was one of the factors that led to the defeat of Prime Minister Shimon Peres and the Israeli Labor Party in the 1996 Israeli general election and the victory of the right-wing Likud party of Netanyahu, who opposed the Oslo peace process:

The wave of terror in February and March 1996 was a case study in how suicide attacks could alter the course of history. At the beginning of February, Peres was up twenty points in the polls over his opposition, the conservative hawk Benjamin &quot;Bibi&quot; Netanyahu. By the middle of March, Netanyahu had closed the gap significantly, and Peres led by only five percentage points. On May 29, Netanyahu won by 1 percent of the vote. This was all due to the terror attacks, which Peres simply couldn&#x27;t stop. Yahya Ayyash&#x27;s disciples had ensured the right wing&#x27;s victory and &quot;derailed the peace process,&quot; in the words of the deputy head of the Shin Bet, Yisrael Hasson. Curiously enough, though, after the election, the attacks stopped for almost a year. Some said this was because of Arafat&#x27;s campaign against Hamas, and the arrest of many members of its military wing. Others believed that Hamas no longer had any reason to carry out suicide attacks, because Netanyahu had already almost completely stopped the peace process, which was the short-term goal of the attacks anyway.

In 1997 Ali Fallahian, the iranian Intelligence Minister, authorized a new Hamas bombing campaign to further disrupt the peace process, and Hamas leader Khaled Meshal, then living in Amman, Jordan, picked Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, an expert bomb-maker in the West Bank, to construct the bombs, and sent five suicide bombers to detonate them simultaneously in Jerusalem on 30 July 1997 (Mahane Yehuda market bombings) and 4 September 1997 (Ben Yehuda street bombings)), killing 21 Israelis.
According to Ronen Bergman based on internal IDF sources, Mashal&#x27;s antidote only secured the release of the two Mossad Kidon agents that were carrying out the assassination attempt. At least six other Mossad agents involved in the operations were holed up in the Israeli embassy. King Hussein would only release them if Israel released Ahmed Yassin and a large number of other Palestinian prisoners. King Hussein needed the demands to be &quot;enough to enable the king to be able to publicly defend the release of the hit team.&quot;

On the same day that Hamas bombed the Ben Yehuda street in Jerusalem, Hezbollah executed a well-planned ambush on the IDF&#x27;s naval specia forces Shayetet 13 in Ansariya, South Lebanon, killing 12 Israeli commandos. On 25 May 1998, the remains of Itamar Ilyah as well as body parts of at least two other soldiers who died in the Ansariya ambush were exchanged for 65 Lebanese prisoners and the bodies of 40 Hizbullah fighters and Lebanese soldiers captured by Israel. Among those returned to Lebanon, were the remains of Hadi Nasrallah, the son of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in a clash with IDF a week after the Ansariya ambush.
 Netanyahu called it &quot;one of the worst tragedies that has ever occurred to us&quot;.

These major Israeli failures against Hamas and Hezbollah under Netanyahu&#x27;s first premiership and their results in the subsequent releases of imprisoned Palestinian and Lebanese leaders from Israeli jails are thought to have dealt a blow to Netanyahu&#x27;s rhetoric of a &quot;tough stance&quot; towards enemies of Israel, and to have played a role in his defeat in the 1999 Israeli general election.

===Election defeat===
After being defeated by Ehud Barak in the 1999 Israeli prime ministerial election, Netanyahu temporarily retired from politics. He subsequently served as a senior consultant with Israeli communications equipment manufacturer BATM Advanced Communications for two years.

With the fall of the Barak government in late 2000, Netanyahu expressed his desire to return to politics. By law, Barak&#x27;s resignation was supposed to lead to elections for the prime minister position only. Netanyahu insisted that general elections should be held, claiming that otherwise it would be impossible to have a stable government. Netanyahu decided eventually not to run for the prime minister position, a move which facilitated the surprising rise to power of Ariel Sharon, who at the time was considered less popular than Netanyahu. In 2002, after the Israeli Labor Party left the coalition and vacated the position of foreign minister, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon appointed Netanyahu as foreign minister. Netanyahu challenged Sharon for the leadership of the Likud party in the 2002 Likud leadership election, but failed to oust him.

On 9 September 2002, a scheduled speech by Netanyahu at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada was canceled after hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters overwhelmed security and smashed through a glass window. Netanyahu was not present at the protest, having remained at his hotel throughout the duration. He later accused the activists of supporting terrorism and &quot;mad zealotry&quot;. Weeks later on 1 October 2002 around 200 protesters met Netanyahu outside his Heinz Hall appearance in Pittsburgh although Pittsburgh Police, Israeli security and a Pittsburgh SWAT unit allowed his speeches to continue downtown at the hall and the Duquesne Club as well as suburban Robert Morris University.

On 12 September 2002, Netanyahu testified (under oath as a private citizen) before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform regarding the nuclear threat posed by the Iraqi régime: &quot;There is no question whatsoever that Saddam is seeking and is working and is advancing towards the development of nuclear weapons – no question whatsoever&quot;, he said. &quot;And there is no question that once he acquires it, history shifts immediately.&quot; In his testimony, Netanyahu also said, &quot;If you take out Saddam, Saddam&#x27;s regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region.&quot;

== Minister of Finance (2003–2005) ==
After the 2003 Israeli legislative election, in what many observers regarded as a surprise move, Sharon offered the Foreign Ministry to Silvan Shalom and offered Netanyahu the Finance Ministry. Some pundits speculated that Sharon made the move because he deemed Netanyahu a political threat given his demonstrated effectiveness as foreign minister, and that by placing him in the Finance Ministry during a time of economic uncertainty, he could diminish Netanyahu&#x27;s popularity. Netanyahu accepted the new appointment. Sharon and Netanyahu came to an agreement that Netanyahu would have complete freedom as finance minister and have Sharon back all of his reforms, in exchange for Netanyahu&#x27;s silence over Sharon&#x27;s management of Israel&#x27;s military and foreign affairs.

As finance minister, Netanyahu undertook an economic plan in order to restore Israel&#x27;s economy from its low point during the Second Intifada. Netanyahu claimed that a bloated public sector and excessive regulations were largely responsible for stifling economic growth. His plan involved a move toward more liberalized markets, although it was not without its critics. He instituted a program to end welfare dependency by requiring people to apply for jobs or training, reduced the size of the public sector, froze government spending for three years, and capped the budget deficit at 1%. The taxation system was streamlined and taxes were cut, with the top individual tax rate reduced from 64% to 44% and the corporate tax rate from 36% to 18%. A host of state assets worth billions of dollars were privatized, including banks, oil refineries, the El Al national airline, and Zim Integrated Shipping Services. The retirement ages for both men and women were raised, and currency exchange laws were further liberalized. Commercial banks were forced to spin off their long-term savings. In addition, Netanyahu attacked monopolies and cartels to increase competition. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an &#x27;economic miracle&#x27; by the end of his tenure.

However, opponents in the Labor party (and even a few within his own Likud) viewed Netanyahu&#x27;s policies as &quot;Thatcherite&quot; attacks on the venerated Israeli social safety net. Ultimately, unemployment declined while economic growth soared, the debt-to-GDP ratio dropped to one of the lowest in the world, and foreign investment reached record highs.

Netanyahu threatened to resign from office in 2004 unless the Gaza pullout plan was put to a referendum. He later modified the ultimatum and voted for the program in the Knesset, indicating immediately thereafter that he would resign unless a referendum was held within 14 days. He submitted his resignation letter on 7 August 2005, shortly before the Israeli cabinet voted 17 to 5 to approve the initial phase of withdrawal from Gaza.

== Leader of the Opposition (2006–2009) ==
Following the withdrawal of Sharon from the Likud, Netanyahu was one of several candidates who vied for the Likud leadership. His most recent attempt prior to this was in September 2005 when he had tried to hold early primaries for the position of the head of the Likud party, while the party held the office of prime minister – thus effectively pushing Ariel Sharon out of office. The party rejected this initiative. Netanyahu retook the leadership on 20 December 2005, with 47% of the primary vote, to 32% for Silvan Shalom and 15% for Moshe Feiglin. In the March 2006 Knesset elections, Likud took the third place behind Kadima and Labor and Netanyahu served as Leader of the Opposition. On 14 August 2007, Netanyahu was reelected as chairman of the Likud and its candidate for the post of prime minister with 73% of the vote, against far-right candidate Moshe Feiglin and World Likud chairman Danny Danon. He opposed the 2008 Israel–Hamas ceasefire, like others in the Knesset opposition. Specifically, Netanyahu said: &quot;This is not a relaxation, it&#x27;s an Israeli agreement to the rearming of Hamas ... What are we getting for this?&quot;

In the first half of 2008, doctors removed a small colon polyp that proved to be benign.

Following Tzipi Livni&#x27;s election to head Kadima and Olmert&#x27;s resignation from the post of prime minister, Netanyahu declined to join the coalition Livni was trying to form and supported new elections, which were held in February 2009. Netanyahu was the Likud&#x27;s candidate for prime minister in the 2009 Israeli legislative election which took place on 10 February 2009, as Livni, the previous designated acting prime minister under the Olmert government, had been unable to form a viable governing coalition. Opinion polls showed Likud in the lead, but with as many as a third of Israeli voters undecided.

In the election itself, Likud won the second highest number of seats, Livni&#x27;s party having outnumbered the Likud by one seat. A possible explanation for Likud&#x27;s relatively poor showing is that some Likud supporters defected to Avigdor Lieberman&#x27;s Yisrael Beiteinu party. Netanyahu, however, claimed victory on the basis that right-wing parties won the majority of the vote, and on 20 February 2009, Netanyahu was designated by Israeli President Shimon Peres to succeed Ehud Olmert as prime minister, and began his negotiations to form a coalition government.

Despite right wing parties winning a majority of 65 seats in the Knesset, Netanyahu preferred a broader centrist coalition and turned to his Kadima rivals, chaired by Tzipi Livni, to join his government. This time it was Livni&#x27;s turn to decline to join, with a difference of opinion on how to pursue the peace process being the stumbling block. Netanyahu did manage to entice a smaller rival, the Labour party, chaired by Ehud Barak, to join his government, giving him a certain amount of centrist tone. Netanyahu presented his cabinet for a Knesset &quot;Vote of Confidence&quot; on 31 March 2009. The 32nd Government was approved that day by a majority of 69 lawmakers to 45 (with five abstaining) and the members were sworn in.

== Prime minister (2009–2021) ==

=== Second term ===

In 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton voiced support for the establishment of a Palestinian state – a solution not endorsed by prime minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom she had earlier pledged the United States&#x27; cooperation. Upon the arrival of President Obama administration&#x27;s special envoy, George Mitchell, Netanyahu said that any furtherance of negotiations with the Palestinians would be conditioned on the Palestinians recognizing Israel as a Jewish state.

During President Obama&#x27;s Cairo speech on 4 June 2009 in which Obama addressed the Muslim world, Obama stated, among other things, &quot;The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.&quot; Following Obama&#x27;s Cairo speech Netanyahu immediately called a special government meeting. On 14 June, ten days after Obama&#x27;s Cairo speech, Netanyahu gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he endorsed a &quot;Demilitarized Palestinian State&quot;, though said that Jerusalem must remain the unified capital of Israel. Netanyahu stated that he would accept a Palestinian state if Jerusalem were to remain the united capital of Israel, the Palestinians would have no army, and the Palestinians would give up their demand for a right of return. He also argued the right for a &quot;natural growth&quot; in the existing Jewish settlements in the West Bank while their permanent status is up to further negotiation. Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said that the speech had &quot;closed the door to permanent status negotiations&quot; due to Netanyahu&#x27;s declarations on Jerusalem, refugees and settlements.

Three months after starting his term, Netanyahu remarked that his cabinet already had achieved several notable successes, such as the establishment of a working national unity government, and a broad consensus for a &quot;two-state solution&quot;. A July 2009 survey by Ha&#x27;aretz found that most Israelis supported the Netanyahu government, giving him a personal approval rating of about 49 percent. Netanyahu has lifted checkpoints in the West Bank in order to allow freedom of movement and a flow of imports; a step that resulted in an economic boost in the West Bank. In 2009, Netanyahu welcomed the Arab Peace initiative (also known as the &quot;Saudi Peace Initiative&quot;) and lauded a call by Bahrain&#x27;s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa to normalize relations with Israel.

In August 2009, Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas declared that he would be willing to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the UN General Assembly, where Netanyahu had accepted president Obama&#x27;s invitation for a &quot;triple summit&quot;, although he said it would not necessarily lead to negotiations. Netanyahu was reported to be in a pivotal moment over these understandings, that were reported to include a compromise over permission on continuing the already approved construction in the West Bank in exchange for freezing all settlements thereafter, as well as continuing building in East Jerusalem, and at the same time stopping the demolition of houses of Arab inhabitants there. On 4 September 2009, it was reported that Netanyahu was to agree to settlers&#x27; political demands to approve more settlement constructions before a temporary settlement freeze agreement took place. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed &quot;regret&quot; over the move; however, one U.S. official said the move will not &quot;derail [the] train&quot;.

On 7 September 2009, Netanyahu left his office without reporting where he was headed. The prime minister&#x27;s military secretary, Maj. Gen. Meir Kalifi, later reported Netanyahu had visited a security facility in Israel. Several different news agencies reported several different stories about where he was. On 9 September 2009, &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot; reported that the Israeli leader had made a secret flight to Moscow to try to persuade Russian officials not to sell S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems to Iran. Headlines branded Netanyahu a &quot;liar&quot; and dubbed the affair a &quot;fiasco&quot;. It was later reported that the PM&#x27;s military secretary would be dismissed due to the affair. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that the trip was made to share the names of Russian scientists that Israel believes are abetting the alleged Iranian nuclear weapons program.

On 24 September 2009, in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Netanyahu said Iran poses a threat to the peace of the world and that it is incumbent on the world body to prevent the Islamic Republic from obtaining nuclear weapons. Waving the blueprints for Auschwitz and invoking the memory of his own family members murdered by the Nazis, Netanyahu delivered a passionate and public riposte to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s questioning of the Holocaust, asking: &quot;Have you no shame?&quot;

In response to pressure from the Obama administration urging the sides to resume peace talks, on 25 November 2009 Netanyahu announced a partial 10-month settlement construction freeze plan. The announced partial freeze had no significant effect on actual settlement construction, according to an analysis by the major Israeli daily &quot;Haaretz&quot;. U.S. special envoy George Mitchell said, &quot;while the United States shares Arab concerns about the limitations of Israel&#x27;s gesture, it is more than any Israeli government has ever done&quot;. In his announcement Netanyahu called the move &quot;a painful step that will encourage the peace process&quot; and urged the Palestinians to respond. The Palestinians rejected the call, stating the gesture was &quot;insignificant&quot; in that thousands of recently approved settlement buildings in the West Bank would continue to be built and there would be no freeze of settlement activity in East Jerusalem.

In March 2010, Israel&#x27;s government approved construction of an additional 1,600 apartments in a large Jewish housing development in northern East Jerusalem called Ramat Shlomo despite the position of the current U.S. Government that acts such as this thwart the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. The Israeli government&#x27;s announcement occurred during a visit by U.S. Vice-president Joe Biden and the U.S. government subsequently issued a strongly worded condemnation of the plan. Netanyahu subsequently issued a statement that all previous Israeli governments had continuously permitted construction in the neighborhood, and that certain neighborhoods such as Ramat Shlomo and Gilo have always been included as part of Israel in any final agreement plan that has been proposed by either side to date. Netanyahu regretted the timing of the announcement but asserted that &quot;our policy on Jerusalem is the same policy followed by all Israeli governments for the 42 years, and it has not changed.&quot;
In September 2010, Netanyahu agreed to enter direct talks, mediated by the Obama administration, with the Palestinians for the first time in a long while. The ultimate aim of these direct talks is to forge the framework of an official &quot;final status settlement&quot; to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict by forming a two-state solution for the Jewish people and the Palestinian people. On 27 September, the 10-month settlement freeze ended, and the Israeli government approved new construction in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. On retiring from office in July 2011, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had said that Netanyahu was ungrateful to the United States and endangering Israel. Responding, the Likud party defended Netanyahu by saying that most Israelis supported the Prime Minister and that he had broad support in the United States.

Netanyahu unsuccessfully called for the early release of Jonathan Pollard, an American serving a life sentence for passing secret U.S. documents to Israel in 1987. He has raised the issue at the Wye River Summit in 1998, where he claimed that U.S. President Bill Clinton had privately agreed to release Pollard. In 2002, Netanyahu visited Pollard at his North Carolina prison. The Israeli prime minister maintained contact with Pollard&#x27;s wife, and was active in pressing the Obama administration to release Pollard.

In 2011, social justice protests broke out across Israel. Hundreds of thousands of people protested Israel&#x27;s high cost of living throughout the country. In response, Netanyahu appointed the Trajtenberg Committee, headed by professor Manuel Trajtenberg, to examine the problems and propose solutions. The committee submitted recommendations to lower the high cost of living in September 2011. Although Netanyahu promised to push the proposed reforms through the cabinet in one piece, differences inside his coalition resulted in the reforms being gradually adopted.

Netanyahu&#x27;s cabinet also approved a plan to build a fiber-optic cable network across the country to bring cheap, high-speed fiber-optic Internet access to every home.

In 2012, Netanyahu initially planned to call early elections, but subsequently oversaw the creation of a controversial government of national unity to see Israel through until the national elections of 2013. In May 2012, Netanyahu officially recognized for the first time the right for Palestinians to have their own state in an official document, a letter to Mahmoud Abbas, though as before he declared it would have to be demilitarized. On 25 October 2012, Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman announced that their respective political parties, Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu, had merged and would run together on a single ballot in Israel&#x27;s 22 January 2013 general elections.

=== Third term ===

The 2013 election returned Netanyahu&#x27;s Likud Beiteinu coalition with 11 fewer seats than the combined Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu parties had going into the vote. Nevertheless, as leader of what remained the largest faction in the Knesset, Israeli president Shimon Peres charged Netanyahu with the task of forming the Thirty-third government of Israel. The new coalition included the Yesh Atid, The Jewish Home and Hatnuah parties and excludes the ultra-Orthodox parties at the insistence of Yesh Atid and the Jewish Home.

During Netanyahu&#x27;s third term, he continued his policy of economic liberalization. In December 2013, the Knesset approved the Business Concentration Law, which intended to open Israel&#x27;s highly concentrated economy to competition to lower consumer prices, reduce income inequality, and increase economic growth. Netanyahu had formed the Concentration Committee in 2010, and the bill, which was pushed forward by his government, implemented its recommendations. The new law banned multi-tiered corporate holding structures, in which a CEO&#x27;s family members or other affiliated individuals held public companies which in turn owned other public companies, and who were thus able to engage in price gouging. Under the law, corporations were banned from owning more than two tiers of publicly listed companies and from holding both financial and non-financial enterprises. All conglomerates were given four to six years to sell excess holdings. Netanyahu also began a campaign of port privatization to break what he viewed as the monopoly held by workers of the Israel Port Authority, so as to lower consumer prices and increase exports. In July 2013, he issued tenders for the construction of private ports in Haifa and Ashdod. Netanyahu has also pledged to curb excess bureaucracy and regulations to ease the burden on industry.
In April 2014, and again in June, Netanyahu spoke of his deep concerns when Hamas and the Palestinian Authority agreed and then formed a unity government, and was severely critical of both the United States and European governments&#x27; decision to work with the Palestinian coalition government. He blamed Hamas for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June 2014, and launched a massive search and arrest operation on the West Bank, targeting members of Hamas in particular, and over the following weeks hit 60 targets in Gaza. Missile and rocket exchanges between Gaza militants and the IDF escalated after the bodies of the teenagers, who had been killed almost immediately as the government had good reasons to suspect, were discovered on 30 June 2014. After several Hamas operatives were killed, either in an explosion or from an Israeli bombing, Hamas officially declared it would launch rockets from Gaza into Israel, and Israel started Operation Protective Edge in the Gaza Strip, formally ending the November 2012 ceasefire agreement. The prime minister did a round of television shows in the United States and described Hamas as &quot;genocidal terrorists&quot; in an interview on CNN. When asked if Gazan casualties from the operation might spark &quot;a third intifada&quot;, Netanyahu replied that Hamas was working towards that goal.

In October 2014, Netanyahu&#x27;s government approved a privatization plan to reduce corruption and politicization in government companies, and strengthen Israel&#x27;s capital market. Under the plan, minority stakes of up to 49% in state-owned companies, including arms manufacturers, energy, postal, water, and railway companies, as well as the ports of Haifa and Ashdod. That same month, Netanyahu called criticism of settlements &quot;against the American values&quot;, a remark that earned him a sharp rebuke from the White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, who noted that American values had resulted in Israel receiving not only consistent funding but protective technology such as Iron Dome. Netanyahu explained that he does not accept restrictions on where Jews could live, and said that Jerusalem&#x27;s Arabs and Jews should be able to buy homes wherever they want. He said he was &quot;baffled&quot; by the American condemnation. &quot;It&#x27;s against the American values. And it doesn&#x27;t bode well for peace. The idea that we&#x27;d have this ethnic purification as a condition for peace, I think it&#x27;s anti-peace.&quot; Not long thereafter, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic reported that the relationship between Netanyahu and the White House had reached a new low, with the U.S. administration angry over Israel&#x27;s settlement policies, and Netanyahu expressing contempt for the American administration&#x27;s grasp of the Middle East.

On 2 December 2014, Netanyahu fired two of his ministers, Finance Minister Yair Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid party and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, head of Hatnua. The changes led to the dissolution of the government, with new elections expected on 17 March 2015.

In January 2015, Netanyahu was invited to address the US Congress. This speech marked Netanyahu&#x27;s third speech to a joint session of Congress. The day before announcing he would address Congress, &quot;Time&quot; reported that he tried to derail a meeting between U.S. lawmakers and the head of Mossad, Tamir Pardo, who intended warning them against imposing further sanctions against Iran, a move that might derail nuclear talks. Leading up to the speech, on 3 March 2015, Israeli consuls general in the United States &quot;expect[ed] fierce negative reaction from U.S. Jewish communities and Israel&#x27;s allies&quot;. Objections included the arrangement of the speech without the support and engagement of the Obama administration and the timing of the speech before Israel&#x27;s 17 March 2015 election. Seven American Jewish lawmakers met with Ron Dermer, Israel&#x27;s ambassador to the U.S. and recommended that Netanyahu instead meet with lawmakers privately to discuss Iran. In making the speech, Netanyahu claimed to speak for all Jews worldwide, a claim disputed by others in the Jewish community. Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, stated that &quot;American Jews are largely appalled by the notion that Netanyahu, or any other Israeli politician – one that we did not elect and do not choose to be represented by – claims to speak for us.&quot;

As election day approached in what was perceived to be a close race in the 2015 Israeli elections, Netanyahu answered &#x27;indeed&#x27; when asked whether a Palestinian state would not be established in his term. He said that support of a Palestinian state is tantamount to yielding territory for radical Islamic terrorists to attack Israel. However, Netanyahu reiterated &quot;I don&#x27;t want a one-state solution. I want a peaceful, sustainable two-state solution. I have not changed my policy.&quot;

=== Fourth term ===


In the 2015 election, Netanyahu returned with his party Likud leading the elections with 30 mandates, making it the single highest number of seats for the Knesset. President Rivlin granted Netanyahu an extension until 6 May 2015 to build a coalition when one had not been finalized in the first four weeks of negotiations. He formed a coalition government within two hours of the midnight 6 May deadline. His Likud party formed the coalition with Jewish Home, United Torah Judaism, Kulanu, and Shas.

On 28 May 2015, Netanyahu announced that he would be running for an unprecedented fifth term as prime minister in the next general election and that he supports Likud&#x27;s current process of picking MK candidates.

In August 2015, Netanyahu&#x27;s government approved a two-year budget that would see agricultural reforms and lowering of import duties to reduce food prices, deregulation of the approval process in construction to lower housing costs and speed up infrastructure building, and reforms in the financial sector to boost competition and lower fees for financial services. In the end, the government was forced to compromise by removing some key agricultural reforms.

In October 2015, Netanyahu drew widespread criticism for claiming that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, gave Adolf Hitler the idea for the Holocaust in the preceding months to the Second World War, convincing the Nazi leader to exterminate Jews rather than just expel them from Europe. This idea is dismissed by mainstream historians, who note that al-Husseini&#x27;s meeting with Hitler took place approximately five months after the mass murder of Jews began. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she did not accept Netanyahu&#x27;s claims, and reiterated an acceptance of her country&#x27;s crimes during the Nazi era. Netanyahu later explained that his &quot;aim was not to absolve Hitler from the responsibility he bears, but to show that the father of the Palestinian nation at the time, without a state and before the &#x27;occupation&#x27;, without the territories and with the settlements, even then aspired with systemic incitement for the destruction of the Jews.&quot; Some of the strongest criticism came from Israeli academics: Yehuda Bauer said Netanyahu&#x27;s claim was &quot;completely idiotic&quot;, while Moshe Zimmermann stated that &quot;any attempt to deflect the burden from Hitler to others is a form of Holocaust denial.&quot;

In March 2016, Netanyahu&#x27;s coalition faced a potential crisis as ultra-Orthodox members threatened to withdraw over the government&#x27;s proposed steps to create non-Orthodox prayer space at the Western Wall. They have stated they will leave the coalition if the government offers any further official state recognition of Conservative and Reform Judaism.

On 23 December 2016, the United States, under the Obama Administration, abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, effectively allowing it to pass. On 28 December, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry strongly criticized Israel and its settlement policies in a speech. Netanyahu strongly criticized both the UN Resolution and Kerry&#x27;s speech in response. On 6 January 2017, the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million in United States dollars.

On 22 February 2017, Netanyahu became the first serving prime minister of Israel to visit Australia. He was accompanied by his wife, Sara. The three-day official visit included a delegation of business representatives, and Netanyahu and Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull were scheduled to sign several bilateral agreements. Netanyahu recalled that it was the Australian Light Horse regiments that liberated Beersheba during World War I, and this began what has been a relationship of 100 years between the countries.

On 12 October 2017, shortly after the United States announced the same action, Netanyahu&#x27;s government announced it was leaving UNESCO due to what it saw as anti-Israel actions by the agency, and it made that decision official in December 2017. The Israeli government officially notified UNESCO of the withdrawal in late December 2017.

On 30 April 2018, Netanyahu accused Iran of not holding up its end of the Iran nuclear deal after presenting a cache of over 100,000 documents detailing the extent of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. Iran denounced Netanyahu&#x27;s presentation as &quot;propaganda&quot;.

Netanyahu praised the 2018 North Korea–United States summit. He said in a statement, &quot;I commend US President Donald Trump on the historic summit in Singapore. This is an important step in the effort to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.&quot;

On 19 July 2018, the Knesset passed the Nation-State Bill, a Basic Law supported by Netanyahu&#x27;s coalition government. Analysts saw the bill as a sign of Netanyahu&#x27;s coalition advancing a right-wing agenda.

Prior to the April 2019 Israeli legislative election, Netanyahu helped broker a deal that united the Jewish Home party with the far-right Otzma Yehudit party, in order to form the Union of the Right-Wing Parties. The motivation of the deal was to overcome the electoral threshold for smaller parties. The deal was criticized in the media, as Otzma is widely characterized as racist and traces its origins to the extremist Kahanist movement.

====Criminal investigations and indictment====

Since January 2017, Netanyahu has been investigated and questioned by Israeli police in two cases, &quot;Case 1000&quot; and &quot;Case 2000&quot;. The two cases are connected. In Case 1000, Netanyahu is suspected of having obtained inappropriate favors from businessmen, including James Packer and Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan. Case 2000 involves alleged attempts to strike a deal with the publisher of the &quot;Yedioth Ahronot&quot; newspaper group, Arnon Mozes, to promote legislation to weaken Yedioth&#x27;s main competitor, Israel Hayom, in exchange for more favorable coverage of Netanyahu.

On 3 August 2017, Israeli police confirmed for the first time that Netanyahu was suspected of crimes involving fraud, breach of trust, and bribes in cases &quot;1000&quot; and &quot;2000&quot;. The next day, it was reported that the Prime Minister&#x27;s former chief of staff, Ari Harow, had signed a deal with prosecutors to testify against Netanyahu in these cases.
On 13 February 2018, Israeli police recommended that Netanyahu be charged with corruption. According to a police statement, sufficient evidence exists to indict the prime minister on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in the two cases. Netanyahu responded that the allegations were baseless and that he would continue as prime minister. On 25 November 2018, it was reported that Economic Crimes Division Director Liat Ben-Ari recommended indictment for both cases.

On 28 February 2019, the Israeli attorney general announced his intent to file indictments against Netanyahu on bribe and fraud charges in three different cases. Netanyahu was formally indicted on 21 November 2019. If Netanyahu is convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison for bribery and a maximum of three years for fraud and breach of trust. He is the first sitting prime minister in Israel&#x27;s history to be charged with a crime. On 23 November 2019, it was announced that Netanyahu, in compliance with legal precedent set by the Israeli Supreme Court in 1993, would relinquish his agriculture, health, social affairs and diaspora affairs portfolios. The matter of forcing a prime minister to resign due to an indictment has yet to be tested in court. He was officially charged on 28 January 2020.

Netanyahu&#x27;s criminal trial was set to begin on 24 May 2020, having been initially scheduled for March of that year but delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of April 2023, the criminal trial was still ongoing.

=== Fifth term ===
On 17 May 2020, Netanyahu was sworn in for a fifth term as prime minister in a coalition with Benny Gantz. Against a background of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel and Netanyahu&#x27;s criminal trial, extensive demonstrations broke out against him in front of the prime minister&#x27;s residence. Following this, Netanyahu ordered to disperse the demonstrations using COVID-19 special regulations, limiting them to 20 people and at a distance of 1,000 meters from their homes. However, the exact opposite was achieved; the demonstrations were enlarged and dispersed to over 1,000 centers. By March 2021, Israel became the country with the highest vaccinated population per capita in the world against COVID-19.

After tensions escalated in Jerusalem in May 2021, Hamas fired rockets on Israel from Gaza, which prompted Netanyahu to initiate Operation Guardian of the Walls, lasting eleven days. After the operation, Israeli politician and leader of the Yamina alliance Naftali Bennett announced that he had agreed to a deal with Leader of the Opposition Yair Lapid to form a rotation government that would oust Netanyahu from his position as prime minister. On 13 June 2021, Bennett and Lapid formed a coalition government, and Netanyahu was ousted as prime minister, ending his 12-year tenure.

==Leader of the Opposition (2021–2022)==
After the end of his second premiership, Netanyahu began his third stint as the leader of the opposition. Likud remained the largest party in the twenty-fourth Knesset.
He led the opposition into the 2022 Israeli legislative election.

== Prime minister (2022–present) ==
=== Sixth term ===


After the 2022 election, Netanyahu was sworn in as prime minister again as the leader of a hardline coalition. He officially started his sixth term on 29 December 2022.

The first months of Netanyahu&#x27;s sixth term were centered around a proposed reform package in the judicial branch, which drew widespread criticism. Critics highlighted the negative effects it would have on the separation of powers, the office of the Attorney General, the economy, public health, women and minorities, workers&#x27; rights, scientific research, the overall strength of Israel&#x27;s democracy and its foreign relations. After weeks of public protests on Israel&#x27;s streets, joined by a growing number of military reservists, Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant spoke against the reform on 25 March, calling for a halt of the legislative process &quot;for the sake of Israel&#x27;s security&quot;. Netanyahu announced his intention to remove Gallant from his post the following day, sparking further mass protests across Israel and ultimately leading to Netanyahu agreeing to delay the legislation for a month.

In February 2023, the new government under Netanyahu approved the legalization of nine settler outposts in the occupied West Bank. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich took charge of most of the Civil Administration, obtaining broad authority over civilian issues in the West Bank. Israeli peace groups condemned the move as &quot;de jure&quot; annexation of the occupied territories. In March 2023, Netanyahu&#x27;s government repealed a 2005 law whereby four Israeli settlements, Homesh, Sa-Nur, Ganim and Kadim, were dismantled as part of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. In June 2023, Netanyahu&#x27;s coalition shortened the procedure of approving settlement construction and gave Finance Minister Smotrich the authority to approve one of the stages, changing the system operating for the last 27 years. In its first six months, construction of 13,000 housing units in settlements, almost triple the amount advanced in the whole of 2022.

Israel refused to send lethal weapons to Ukraine. In June 2023, Netanyahu said that Israel is concerned &quot;with the possibility that systems that we would give to Ukraine would fall into Iranian hands and could be reverse engineered, and we would find ourselves facing Israeli systems used against Israel.&quot;

On 7 October 2023, after Palestinian militants from Gaza launched a major surprise attack, Netanyahu announced that Israel would enter in a state of war against Hamas. He threatened to &quot;turn all the places where Hamas is organized and hiding into cities of ruins&quot;, called Gaza &quot;the city of evil&quot;, and urged its residents to &quot;leave now&quot;. He later proposed that opposition parties Yesh Atid and National Unity enter an emergency unity government amid the conflict, after Leader of the Opposition Lapid urged Nethanyahu put &quot;aside our differences and form an emergency, narrow, professional government.&quot;

Netanyahu was criticized for presiding over Israel&#x27;s biggest intelligence failure in 50 years, and has faced protests calling for his removal. The outbreak of war led to increased opposition to Netanyahu and the government from Israeli citizens due to a perceived failure to anticipate the Hamas-led attack, with increased calls for Netanyahu&#x27;s resignation. A poll in 2023 showed that 56% of Israelis believed that Netanyahu must resign after the war, with 86% of respondents holding the country&#x27;s leadership responsible for the security failings that led to the attack. On 28 October 2023, Netanyahu was accused of using &quot;dangerous rhetoric&quot; when comparing Hamas to Amalek, stating: &quot;You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible. And we do remember.&quot; On 29 October, Netanyahu blamed Israel&#x27;s security chiefs for Hamas&#x27;s attack in a post on X (formerly Twitter); this was later deleted following criticism.
On 11 November 2023, he rejected calls for a ceasefire in the war and warned that Israel will &quot;stand firm against the world if necessary.&quot; He said the Israel Defense Forces would remain in Gaza &quot;as long as necessary&quot; and Israel would prevent the Palestinian Authority from returning to Gaza. Netanyahu called allegations that Israel is breaking international law &quot;hogwash&quot; and described Palestinian civilian casualties as &quot;collateral damage.&quot; On 5 December 2023, he faced criticism during a meeting with released Israeli hostages. One of the hostages accused him of putting politics &quot;above the return of the kidnapped.&quot; In December 2023, Netanyahu said that Israel should support the &quot;voluntary migration&quot; of Palestinians from Gaza. Netanyahu has been accused of genocide by non-governmental organizations, culminating in the &quot;South Africa v. Israel&quot; case before the International Court of Justice in December 2023. 

On 20 May 2024, Karim Khan, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, announced his intention to apply for an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on several counts of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

On 24 July 2024, Netanyahu addressed another joint session of the United States Congress, amidst widespread protest, to solicit support for the Gaza war. He called protesters &quot;useful idiots&quot; and pledged a &quot;total victory&quot; in Gaza. On 24 July, he met with 2024 Republican nominee for president Donald Trump in Florida at his Mar-a-Lago residence where he criticized presumptive Democratic nominee for President Kamala Harris for vowing that she &quot;will not be silent&quot; about atrocities in Gaza.

On 19 October 2024, a drone attack believed to have originated from Lebanon was made on Netanyahu&#x27;s residence in Caesarea. Netanyahu was not in the residence at the time, while no casualties were reported. Netanyahu accused Hezbollah of trying to assassinate him in the attack.

On 21 November 2024, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his former defence minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif for alleged war crimes committed during the Gaza war. Netanyahu described the ruling as &quot;absurd and false lies&quot; and said the decision is &quot;antisemitic&quot;.

== Political positions ==
=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===
Netanyahu opposed the Oslo Accords from their inception. In 1993, he dedicated a chapter, entitled &quot;Trojan Horse&quot;, of his book &quot;A Place Among the Nations&quot; to argue against the Oslo peace process. He asserted that Amin al-Husseini had been one of the masterminds of the Holocaust, and that Yasser Arafat was heir to the former&#x27;s &quot;alleged exterminationist Nazism&quot;. During his term as prime minister in the late 1990s, Netanyahu consistently reneged on commitments made by previous Israeli governments as part of the Oslo peace process, leading American peace envoy Dennis Ross to note that &quot;neither President Clinton nor Secretary [of State Madeleine] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace.&quot; In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said:

On 9 August 2009, speaking at the opening of his weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu promised not to repeat the &quot;mistake&quot; of the Gaza unilateral pullout, saying, &quot;We will not repeat this mistake. We will not create new evacuees&quot;, and adding that &quot;the unilateral evacuation brought neither peace nor security. On the contrary&quot;, and that &quot;We want an agreement with two factors, the first of which is the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and [the second is] a security settlement. In the case of Gaza, both of these factors were lacking&quot;. He also said, &quot;Should we achieve a turn toward peace with the more moderate partners, we will insist on the recognition of the State of Israel and the demilitarization of the future Palestinian state&quot;. In October 2014, Netanyahu said:

Netanyahu had previously called U.S.-backed peace talks a waste of time, while at the same time refusing to commit to the same two-state solution as had other Israeli leaders, until a speech in June 2009. He repeatedly made public statements which advocated an &quot;economic peace&quot; approach, meaning an approach based on economic cooperation and joint effort rather than continuous contention over political and diplomatic issues. This is in line with many significant ideas from the Peace Valley plan. He raised these ideas during discussions with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Netanyahu continued to advocate these ideas as the Israeli elections approached. Netanyahu has said:

 Right now, the peace talks are based on only one thing, only on peace talks. It makes no sense at this point to talk about the most contractible issue. It&#x27;s Jerusalem or bust, or right of return or bust. That has led to failure and is likely to lead to failure again ... We must weave an economic peace alongside a political process. That means that we have to strengthen the moderate parts of the Palestinian economy by handing rapid growth in those areas, rapid economic growth that gives a stake for peace for the ordinary Palestinians.&quot;

In January 2009, prior to the February 2009 Israeli elections Netanyahu informed Middle East envoy Tony Blair that he would continue the policy of the Israeli governments of Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert by expanding settlements in the West Bank, in contravention of the Road Map, but not building new ones.

In 2013, Netanyahu denied reports that his government would agree to peace talks on the basis of the green line. In 2014 he agreed to the American framework based on the green line and said that Jewish settlers must be allowed the option of staying in their settlements under Palestinian rule.

In 2014, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat criticized Netanyahu, calling him &quot;ideologically corrupt&quot; and a war criminal.

For years, Netanyahu backed Qatari transfers of hundreds of millions of dollars to Gaza, in the hope that it would pacify Gaza, turn Hamas into an effective counterweight to the Palestinian Authority and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. In 2019, Netanyahu said at a private Likud party meeting, &quot;Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas. This is part of our strategy – to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.&quot; Often, cash was delivered in suitcases by a Qatari official who was escorted by Israeli intelligence officers. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Netanyahu continued backing the payments in response to Qatari questions as late as September 2023. In 2025, Shin Beth started an investigation into the alleged ties between Netanyahu&#x27;s advisors and Qatar. 
In January 2020, Netanyahu publicly supported Trump&#x27;s Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. After the peace proposal failed, Trump said Netanyahu &quot;never wanted peace&quot; with the Palestinians.

Former United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that on 22 May 2017, Netanyahu showed Donald Trump a fake and altered video of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas calling for the killing of children. This was at a time when Trump was considering if Israel was the obstacle to peace. Netanyahu had showed Trump the fake video to change his position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords agreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (the Israel–United Arab Emirates normalization agreement) and Bahrain, respectively (the Bahrain–Israel normalization agreement). This was the first time any Arab country had normalized relations with Israel since Jordan in 1994. The accords were signed by Bahrain&#x27;s foreign minister, UAE&#x27;s foreign minister and Netanyahu on 15 September 2020 at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C.
On 23 October 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Sudan will start to normalize ties with Israel, making it the third Arab state to do so as part of the Trump administration-brokered Abraham Accords. Sudan fought in wars against Israel in 1948 and 1967. Netanyahu thanked &quot;President Trump and his team above all&quot;, saying that &quot;together with him we are changing history ... despite all the experts and commentators who said it was impossible. Israel was completely isolated and they told us we were heading into a political tsunami. What&#x27;s happening is the absolute opposite.&quot; This was followed by Morocco establishing relations with Israel in December. In July 2024, Pakistan officially designated him a &quot;terrorist&quot;, calling him responsible for the atrocities in Gaza.

==== Bar-Ilan speech ====
In June 2009, Netanyahu delivered an address at Bar-Ilan University, known as the &quot;Bar-Ilan speech&quot;, at Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, that was broadcast live in Israel and across parts of the Arab world, on the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. He endorsed for the first time the notion of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Netanyahu&#x27;s speech could be viewed in part as a response to Obama&#x27;s 4 June speech at Cairo. &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot; claimed Obama&#x27;s words had &quot;resonated through Jerusalem&#x27;s corridors&quot;.

As part of his proposal, Netanyahu demanded full demilitarization of the proposed state, with no army, rockets, missiles, or control of its airspace, and said Jerusalem would be undivided Israeli territory. He stated that the Palestinians should recognize Israel as the Jewish national state with an undivided Jerusalem. He rejected a right of return for Palestinian refugees, saying, &quot;any demand for resettling Palestinian refugees within Israel undermines Israel&#x27;s continued existence as the state of the Jewish people.&quot; He stated that a complete stop to settlement building in the West Bank, as required by the 2003 road map for peace, was impossible and the expansions would be limited based on the &quot;natural growth&quot; of the population, including immigration, with no new territories taken. Nevertheless, Netanyahu affirmed that he accepted the road map. He did not discuss whether or not the settlements should be part of Israel after peace negotiations, simply stating that the &quot;question will be discussed&quot;.

In a response to Obama&#x27;s statements in his Cairo speech, Netanyahu remarked, &quot;there are those who say that if the Holocaust had not occurred, the State of Israel would never have been established. But I say that if the State of Israel would have been established earlier, the Holocaust would not have occurred.&quot; He said, &quot;this is the homeland of the Jewish people, this is where our identity was forged.&quot; He stated that he would be willing to meet with any &quot;Arab leader&quot; for negotiations without preconditions, specifically mentioning Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon. The address represented a new position for Netanyahu&#x27;s government on the peace process.

Right-wing members of Netanyahu&#x27;s governing coalition criticized his remarks for the creation of a Palestinian State, believing all of the land should come under Israeli sovereignty. Likud MK Danny Danon said Netanyahu went &quot;against the Likud platform&quot;, while MK Uri Orbach of Habayit Hayehudi said it had &quot;dangerous implications&quot;. Opposition party Kadima leader Tzipi Livni remarked that she thinks Netanyahu does not really believe in the two-state solution at all; she thought he only said what he did as a feigned response to international pressure. Peace Now criticized the speech, stating it did not address the Palestinians as equal partners in the peace process. The Secretary General of Peace Now, said, &quot;It&#x27;s a rerun of Netanyahu from his first term&quot;.

On 9 August 2009, speaking at the opening of a government meeting, Netanyahu repeated his claims from the Palestinians: &quot;We want an agreement with two factors, the first of which is the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and (the second of which is) a security settlement&quot;.

Netanyahu&#x27;s speech provoked mixed reaction from the international community. The Palestinian National Authority rejected the conditions on a Palestinian State. Saeb Erekat said, &quot;Netanyahu&#x27;s speech closed the door to permanent status negotiations&quot;. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said it reflected a &quot;racist and extremist ideology&quot; and called on Arab nations to &quot;form stronger opposition&quot;. Palestinian Islamic Jihad labeled it &quot;misleading&quot; and demanded stronger opposition to Israel from Arab nations. According to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, some leaders advocated a third intifada in response to the speech.

The Arab League dismissed it, declaring that &quot;Arabs would not make concessions regarding issues of Jerusalem and refugees&quot; and that &quot;we know his history and style of evasion&quot;, adding that the Arab League would not recognize Israel as a Jewish state. Referring to Netanyahu&#x27;s demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people, Egypt&#x27;s president Hosni Mubarak remarked, &quot;You won&#x27;t find anyone to answer that call in Egypt, or in any other place.&quot; Issuing a less blunt response, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said the speech was &quot;not complete&quot; and it hoped for another, &quot;different Israeli proposal...built on the commitment to the two-state solution&quot;. Syrian state media condemned the speech and wrote &quot;Netanyahu has confirmed that he rejects the Arab peace initiative for peace along with all the initiatives and resolutions of the Security Council to relative peace.&quot;

Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said &quot;Arab leaders should be more united and preserve the spirit of resistance to face the Israeli stands regarding the peace process and the Palestinian refugee issue.&quot; He called on the international community to exert more pressure on Israel to accept the Arab Peace Initiative, as he said &quot;Israel still has a will of military confrontation which can be proved in its offensives on Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.&quot; Jordanian officials said &quot;The ideas presented by Netanyahu do not live up to what was agreed on by the international community as a starting point for achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region.&quot; Former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad referred to the speech as &quot;bad news&quot;.

The Czech Republic praised Netanyahu&#x27;s address. &quot;...this is a step in the right direction. The acceptance of a Palestinian state was present there&quot;, said Foreign Minister Jan Kohout, whose country held the EU&#x27;s presidency at the time. President Obama&#x27;s press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said the speech was an &quot;important step forward&quot;. Obama stated that &quot;this solution can and must ensure both Israel&#x27;s security and the Palestinians&#x27; legitimate aspirations for a viable state&quot;. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt stated that &quot;the fact that he uttered the word state is a small step forward&quot;. He added that &quot;whether what he mentioned can be defined as a state is a subject of some debate&quot;. France praised the speech but called on Israel to cease building settlements in the West Bank. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stated, &quot;I can only welcome the prospect of a Palestinian state outlined by the Israeli prime minister.&quot; The Foreign Ministry of Russia called the speech &quot;a sign of readiness for dialogue&quot; but said &quot;it does not open up the road to resolving the Israeli–Palestinian problem. The conditions on the Palestinians would be unacceptable.&quot;

=== Economic views ===

By 1998, Netanyahu had acquired a reputation as &quot;the advocate of the free-market&quot; and in 1999 told the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;: &quot;Peace is an end of itself [...] peace, without free markets, will not produce growth. But free markets without peace do produce growth.&quot; As prime minister in his first term, he significantly reformed the banking sector, removing barriers to investment abroad, mandatory purchases of government securities and direct credit. As Minister of Finance (2003–2005), Netanyahu introduced a major overhaul of the Israeli economy. He introduced a welfare to work program, he led a program of privatization, reduced the size of the public sector, reformed and streamlined the taxation system and passed laws against monopolies and cartels with the aim of increasing competition. Netanyahu extended capital gains taxes from companies to individuals, which allowed him to enlarge the tax base while reducing taxes on incomes. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an &#x27;economic miracle&#x27; by the end of his tenure. Direct investment in the Israeli economy had increased by an annualized 380%. On the other hand, his critics have labelled his economic views as Margaret Thatcher-inspired &quot;popular capitalism&quot;.

Netanyahu defines capitalism as &quot;the ability to have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from trying to do the same&quot;. He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: &quot;It was the first time that the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and I could see that they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn&#x27;t get the competition or the growth ... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I&#x27;ll change that.&quot;

=== Views on counter-terrorism ===
Netanyahu has said his own &quot;hard line against all terrorists&quot; came as a result of his brother&#x27;s death. Yoni Netanyahu had been killed while leading the hostage-rescue mission at Operation Entebbe.

In addition to having taken part in counter-terrorist operations during his service in the military, Netanyahu has published three books on the subject of fighting terrorism. He identifies terrorism as a form of totalitarianism, writing: The more far removed the target of the attack from any connection to the grievance enunciated by the terrorists, the greater the terror ... Yet for terrorism to have any impact, it is precisely the lack of connection, the lack of any possible involvement or &quot;complicity&quot; of the chosen victims in the cause the terrorists seek to attack, that produces the desired fear. For terrorism&#x27;s underlying message is that every member of society is &quot;guilty&quot;, that anyone can be a victim, and that therefore no one is safe... In fact, the methods reveal the totalitarian strain that runs through all terrorist groups... It is not only that the ends of the terrorists do not succeed in justifying the means they choose; their choice of means indicate what their true ends are. Far from being fighters for freedom, terrorists are the forerunners of tyranny. Terrorists use the techniques of violent coercion in order to achieve a regime of violent coercion.Netanyahu cautions that:The trouble with active anti-terror activities... is that they do constitute a substantial intrusion on the lives of those being monitored.He believes there is a balance between civil liberties and security, which should depend on the level of sustained terrorist attacks in a country. During periods of sustained attack, there should be shift towards security, due to &quot;the monstrous violation of personal rights which is the lot of the victims of terror and their families&quot;. But this should be regularly reviewed, with an emphasis on guarding civil liberties and individual privacy wherever and whenever security considerations allow: &quot;The concern of civil libertarians over possible infringements of the rights of innocent citizens is well placed, and all additional powers granted the security services should require annual renewal by the legislature, this in addition to judicial oversight of actions as they are taken in the field.&quot;

He advises tighter immigration laws as an essential tool to preemptively combat terrorism: &quot;This era of immigration free-for-all should be brought to an end. An important aspect of taking control of the immigration situation is stricter background checks of potential immigrants, coupled with the real possibility of deportation.&quot;

He also cautions that it is essential that governments do not conflate terrorists with those legitimate political groups that may or may not hold extremist views, but which advance their positions by means of debate and argument: &quot;Democracies have their share of anti-immigrant or anti-establishment parties, as well as advocates of extreme nationalism or internationalism ... [T]hey are often genuinely convinced participants in democracy, accepting its basic ground rules and defending its central tenets. These can and must be distinguished from the tiny splinters at the absolute fringes of democratic society, which may endorse many similar ideas, but use them as a pretext to step outside the rubric of the democratic system&quot;.

In particular, Ronald Reagan was an admirer of Netanyahu&#x27;s work on counter-terrorism, and Reagan recommended Netanyahu&#x27;s book &quot;Terrorism: How the West Can Win&quot; to all senior figures in his administration.

=== Death penalty ===
In 2017, Netanyahu called for the death penalty to be imposed on the perpetrator of the 2017 Halamish stabbing attack. Representatives in his government introduced a bill which would allow the death penalty for terrorism to the Knesset. In a preliminary vote in January 2018, 52 of 120 members of the Israeli parliament voted in favor while 49 opposed, to make it easier for judges to hand down the death penalty. The amendment to the penal code would still require three more readings if it is to become law.

=== LGBT rights ===
Netanyahu supports equal rights for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) persons. He said: &quot;The struggle for every person to be recognized as equal before the law is a long struggle, and there is still a long way to go ... I am proud that Israel is among the most open countries in the world in relation to the LGBT community discourse.&quot; During an event held for the annual community rights day at the Knesset, Netanyahu said that he was &quot;asked to come here in the middle of my busy schedule to say one thing to the male and female members of the LGBT community: We must be guided by the conviction that every person is created in the image of God.&quot; However, some of his coalition government&#x27;s party members opposed same-sex marriage.

=== Ethiopian Jewish integration ===
In 2015, after Ethiopian Jewish protests against police brutality, Netanyahu said: &quot;We will bring a comprehensive plan to the government to assist you in every way. There is no room for racism and discrimination in our society, none ... We will turn racism into something contemptible and despicable.&quot;

=== African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem ===
Netanyahu supports the integration of the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem into Israeli society, and takes part in celebrations in honor of this community&#x27;s &quot;exodus&quot; from America to Israel, which occurred in 1967. In 2012, Netanyahu expressed appreciation towards &quot;the cooperative society that is working towards the inclusion of the Hebrew Israelite community in Israeli society at large,&quot; and declared that the experience of the community in the land of Israel is &quot;an integral part of the Israeli experience.&quot;

=== Iran ===

In an 8 March 2007 interview with CNN, opposition leader Netanyahu claimed that &quot;there is only one difference between Nazi Germany and the Islamic Republic of Iran, namely that the first entered a worldwide conflict and then sought atomic weapons, while the latter is first seeking atomic weapons and, once it has them, will then start a world war.&quot; Netanyahu repeated these remarks at a news conference in April 2008. This was similar to earlier remarks that &quot;it&#x27;s 1938, and Iran is Germany, and Iran is racing to arm itself with atomic bombs&quot;.

On 20 February 2009, after being asked to be the prime minister of Israel, Netanyahu described Iran as the greatest threat that Israel has ever faced: &quot;Iran is seeking to obtain a nuclear weapon and constitutes the gravest threat to our existence since the war of independence.&quot; Speaking before the UN General Assembly in New York on 24 September 2009, Netanyahu expressed a different opinion than Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s speech at the forum, saying those who believe Tehran is a threat only to Israel are wrong. &quot;The Iranian regime&quot;, he said, &quot;is motivated by fanaticism ... They want to see us go back to medieval times. The struggle against Iran pits civilization against barbarism. This Iranian regime is fueled by extreme fundamentalism.&quot; &quot;By focusing solely on Iran&quot;, columnist Yossi Melman speculated that Netanyahu&#x27;s foreign policy, &quot;... took the Palestinian issue off the world agenda.&quot; After four days of shelling from the Iranian-funded Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Melman asked, &quot;Is it worth initiating a crisis with Iran? Will the Israeli public be able to cope with Iran&#x27;s response?&quot;

According to Uzi Eilam, a retired brigadier general and the ex-director of Israel&#x27;s Atomic Energy Commission, Netanyahu is using the threat of atomic Iran as a means of reaching his own goals. Directly blaming Netanyahu, he said: &quot;Netanyahu is using the Iranian threat to achieve a variety of political objectives.&quot; He also said: &quot;These declarations are unnecessarily scaring Israel&#x27;s citizens, given Israel is not party to the negotiations to determine whether Iran will or will not dismantle its nuclear program.&quot;
By 2012, Netanyahu is reported to have formed a close, confidential relationship with Defense Minister Ehud Barak as the two men considered possible Israeli military action against Iran&#x27;s nuclear facilities, following Israel&#x27;s established Begin Doctrine. The pair were accused of acting on &quot;messianic&quot; impulses by Yuval Diskin, former head of the Shin Bet, who added that their warmongering rhetoric appealed to &quot;the idiots within the Israeli public&quot;. Diskin&#x27;s remarks were supported by former Mossad chief Meir Dagan, who himself had previously said that an attack on Iran was &quot;the stupidest thing I have ever heard&quot;. A few weeks later, the RAND Corporation (a leading American think-tank that advises the Pentagon) also openly disagreed with Netanyahu&#x27;s belligerent stance: &quot;In doing so, and without naming names, RAND sided with former Mossad chief Meir Dagan and former head of the Shin Bet Yuval Diskin.&quot;

Early in 2012, he used the opening ceremony for Israel&#x27;s Holocaust Remembrance Day to warn against the dangers of an Iranian nuclear bomb, saying he was following the example of Jewish leaders during World War II who struggled to raise the alarm about the Nazis&#x27; genocidal intentions. Israeli academic Avner Cohen accused Netanyahu of showing &quot;contempt&quot; for the Holocaust by putting it to &quot;political use&quot;, and former Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami similarly condemned Netanyahu&#x27;s &quot;vulgar manipulation of the memory of the Holocaust&quot;. Immediately after the 2012 Burgas bus bombing, Netanyahu confirmed that the attack had been undertaken in coordination with Iran.

Netanyahu stated during a 29 July meeting that, in his opinion, &quot;all the sanctions and diplomacy so far have not set back the Iranian programme by one iota&quot;. And in August he stated that the United States only might respond to a massive attack against Israel. On 28 September 2012, Netanyahu gave a speech to the UN General Assembly in which he set forward a &quot;red line&quot; of 90% uranium enrichment, stating that if Iran were to reach this level, it would become an intolerable risk for Israel. Netanyahu used a cartoon graphic of a bomb to illustrate his point, indicating three stages of uranium enrichment, noting that Iran had already completed the first stage, and stating that &quot;By next spring, at most by next summer at current enrichment rates, [Iran] will have finished the medium enrichment and move on to the final stage. From there, it&#x27;s only a few months, possibly a few weeks before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb.&quot; At the time, according to cables leaked in 2015, Mossad&#x27;s assessment was that Iran did not appear ready to enrich uranium to levels required for a nuclear bomb.

In an October 2013 interview with BBC Persian Service, Netanyahu praised the history of Persia and said: &quot;If the Iranian regime has nuclear weapons, the Iranian people will never be free of dictatorship and will live in eternal servitude.&quot;

The U.S. military&#x27;s 2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike, which killed the high-level Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, brought strong reactions from around the world. Netanyahu praised the air strike, saying that Trump had acted &quot;swiftly, forcefully and decisively&quot;.

=== Bank of China terror financing case ===
In 2013, Netanyahu found himself caught between conflicting commitments made to the family of American terror victim Daniel Wultz and the Government of China. Although Netanyahu was reported to have previously promised U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen that Israel would fully cooperate in the terror-financing case against Bank of China in U.S. District Court, the prime minister reportedly made a conflicting promise to the Government of China prior to a state visit to China in May 2013. Attorney David Boies, lead counsel for the Wultz family, told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;While we are respectful of China&#x27;s interests, and of the diplomatic pressure to which Israel has been subjected, those interests and that pressure cannot be permitted to obstruct the ability of American courts to hear critical evidence.&quot;

In August 2013, Ros-Lehtinen, chair of the House Middle East and South Asia subcommittee, told the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; she raised the issue while leading a congressional delegation to Israel, stressing to Israeli officials the importance of them providing the Wultz family what they need for their lawsuit. &quot;I am hopeful that we can bring this case to a conclusion that is satisfactory to the family, but we need community support to not waver at this critical time,&quot; Ros-Lehtinen said.

U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee, also spoke out on the issue with the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;: &quot;In South Florida, we all know too well of the tragic circumstances surrounding the cowardly terrorist attack that took Daniel Wultz&#x27;s innocent life. I have been working, hand in hand with the Wultz family and the state of Israel to ensure any and all of those involved in this terrorist activity, including the Bank of China, pay for their crimes so that justice can be served.&quot;

=== Defense and security ===

In 2011, Netanyahu arranged for 1000 Hamas and Fatah prisoners to be swapped for Gilad Shalit, including terrorists with &quot;blood on their hands&quot;. Israeli officials estimate that 60% of those who are released &quot;resume terrorism attacks&quot;.

In 2011, Israeli General Staff concluded that the armed forces cannot maintain their battle readiness under Netanyahu&#x27;s proposed cuts. However Netanyahu decided to cut social programs instead, and promised to increase the defense budget by about six percent. In spite of this, the Israeli military still fell NIS 3.7 million short from its projected budget, which could damage their war capabilities. According to a U.S. State Department representative in November 2011, under the leadership of Netanyahu and Obama, Israel and the United States have enjoyed unprecedented security cooperation.

Under Netanyahu&#x27;s leadership, the Israeli National Security Council has seen an expanded role in foreign policy planning and decision-making.

During the Gaza war he called for Israel to assume &quot;overall security responsibility&quot; over the Gaza Strip, saying &quot;we&#x27;ve seen what happens when we don&#x27;t have it [...] what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn&#x27;t imagine&quot;.

===Illegal immigration===
In his 1995 book &quot;Fighting Terrorism: How Democracies Can Defeat Domestic and International Terrorism&quot;, Netanyahu strongly argued that tightening immigration laws in the West is the most effective method to combat terrorism. &quot;This era of immigration free-for-all should be brought to an end&quot;, he wrote in 1995.

In 2012, the Netanyahu government passed the &quot;Prevention of Infiltration Law&quot;, which mandated automatic detention of all people, including asylum-seekers, who enter Israel without permission. Amnesty International called it &quot;an affront to international law&quot;. Between 2009 and 2013, approximately 60,000 people crossed into Israel from various African countries. Netanyahu said that &quot;this phenomenon is very grave and threatens the social fabric of society, our national security and our national identity.&quot; Many of these migrants are held in detention camps in the Negev desert. When the Supreme Court of Israel declared the &quot;Prevention of Infiltration Law&quot; illegal for permitting immediate and indefinite detention of asylum seekers from Africa, Netanyahu requested new legislation to work around the Supreme Court ruling.

Netanyahu is critical of what he sees as the overly open immigration policy of EU nations. Netanyahu has urged the leaders of Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland to close their borders to illegal immigration.

== Relations with foreign leaders ==
As the longest serving prime minister of Israel for over 17 years, he developed close relationships with foreign leaders. Netanyahu has a close relationship with Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, their having known each other for decades due to the privileged relationship between the Likud Party and the EPP, the European People&#x27;s Party. Orban particularly admired Netanyahu while he was working as finance minister, and received advice from him while Netanyahu was Finance Minister of Israel.

Netanyahu has been noted for his close and friendly relationship with former-late Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Netanyahu has said of Berlusconi: &quot;We are lucky that there is a leader such as yourself.&quot; Netanyahu has described Berlusconi as &quot;one of the greatest friends&quot;.

Netanyahu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi developed a close relationship and ties between India and Israel increased during their rule.

Netanyahu had a warm relationship and &quot;personal friendship&quot; with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In his 2022 book, Netanyahu wrote positively about Putin and describes him as &quot;smart, sophisticated and focused on one goal – returning Russia to its historical greatness&quot;. Their relationship has been strained since the start of the Gaza war. 

In early 2018, the Polish parliament adopted a new Polish law criminalizing suggestions that Poles were collectively complicit in Holocaust-related or other war crimes that had been committed during World War II by the Axis powers. Later that year at the Munich Security Conference, Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said &quot;it is not going to be seen as criminal to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators ... not only German perpetrators&quot; implicated in the Jewish Holocaust. Netanyahu called his Polish counterpart&#x27;s comment &quot;outrageous&quot; for saying that Jews had been among the Holocaust&#x27;s perpetrators. The resulting crisis in Israel–Poland relations was resolved in late June that year when the two prime ministers issued a joint communiqué endorsing research into the Jewish Holocaust and condemning the misnomer &quot;Polish concentration camps&quot;.

According to Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, during the visit of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Jerusalem, Netanyahu failed to publicly address Ukraine&#x27;s official policy of rehabilitating local Nazi collaborators like UPA leader Roman Shukhevych, who had participated in the murder of Jews.

Netanyahu has developed a close relationship with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro following Bolsonaro&#x27;s election in 2018.

Netanyahu has a good relationship with Argentinian president Javier Milei, having called him a &quot;great friend of the Jewish State&quot;, shortly after Milei started his tenure as president.

Since 2023, Netanyahu and Chinese President Xi Jinping have been engaged in diplomacy, arising due to strained ties between the US and Israel. The diplomatic situation has been made complicated due to the Gaza war, where China has remained neutral.

Netanyahu and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan have tense relations. In March 2019, after being denounced by Turkey as a racist for saying that Israel was the nation-state of the Jewish people only, Netanyahu called Erdoğan a dictator and mocked him for imprisoning journalists in a tweet. In response, Erdoğan called Netanyahu as &quot;the thief who heads Israel&quot;, referencing the ongoing corruption scandals against Netanyahu. In the same speech, Erdoğan further escalated the spat by addressing to Netanyahu directly, saying, &quot;you are a tyrant. You are a tyrant who slaughters 7-year-old Palestinian kids&quot;, and further in April 2018, calling Israel &quot;terror state&quot; and Netanyahu &quot;terrorist&quot;. Netanyahu tweeted that &quot;Erdoğan is among Hamas&#x27;s biggest supporters and there is no doubt that he well understands terrorism and slaughter.&quot; Netanyahu condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria and warned against ethnic cleansing of Kurds by Turkey and its proxies.

=== US leaders ===
Netanyahu has close ties with the congressional leadership of the U.S. Republican Party and with its 2012 presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. He and Romney first became acquainted when both worked at the Boston Consulting Group in the mid-1970s.

During the 2011 G-20 Cannes summit, then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy was overheard saying to then-U.S. President Barack Obama, &quot;I cannot bear Netanyahu, he&#x27;s a liar&quot;, and Obama reportedly responded, &quot;You&#x27;re fed up with him, but I have to deal with him every day.&quot;

In October 2014, author Jeffrey Goldberg related a conversation in which Goldberg said that a senior official of the Obama administration called Netanyahu a &quot;chickenshit&quot; after Netanyahu accused U.S. President Barack Obama of &quot;acting contrary to American values&quot;. Goldberg went on to say that Netanyahu and his cabinet were largely to blame for the tensions between the Netanyahu and Obama governments. Secretary of State John Kerry phoned Netanyahu to clarify that &quot;such statements are disgraceful, unacceptable and damaging&quot; and &quot;do not reflect the position of the United States&quot;. Netanyahu responded by saying &quot;I&#x27;m being attacked because of my determination to defend Israel&#x27;s interests. The safety of Israel is not important to those who attack me anonymously and personally.&quot; Because of evident rifts between Netanyahu and members of the Obama administration, observers have characterized the relationship as having reached a crisis level by October 2014. The relationship between Netanyahu and the Obama administration had become problematic enough that Goldberg reported in November 2014 that his conversations with Netanyahu and other Israeli officials indicated that Israel would wait until a new U.S. president is elected before attempting to repair the relationship with the White House. According to Alon Pinkas, a former diplomat and adviser to Israeli prime ministers, &quot;Netanyahu&#x27;s self-righteousness that this resolution is going to be changed or reversed by Trump is totally unfounded.&quot;

On 23 December 2016, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for an end to Israeli settlements. In a departure from longstanding American policy, the U.S., under the Obama administration, abstained from the vote and did not exercise its veto power. At the behest of the Netanyahu government, President-elect Trump attempted to intercede by publicly advocating for the resolution to be vetoed, as well as successfully persuading Egypt&#x27;s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to temporarily withdraw it from consideration. The resolution was then &quot;proposed again by Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela&quot; – and passed 14 to 0. Netanyahu&#x27;s office alleged that &quot;the Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against this gang-up at the UN, it colluded with it behind the scenes&quot;, adding: &quot;Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution.&quot;

Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump have known each other for many years. Netanyahu had been a friend of Donald Trump&#x27;s father, Fred, when Netanyahu lived in New York during the 1980s, serving as UN ambassador. In 2013, Trump made a video endorsing Netanyahu during the Israeli elections saying, &quot;vote for Benjamin – terrific guy, terrific leader, great for Israel&quot;. In June 2019, Netanyahu officially renamed a settlement in the disputed Golan Heights after Donald Trump. However, Trump aide Jared Kushner has claimed that in January 2020, Trump became frustrated with Netanyahu&#x27;s rhetoric regarding annexation of the Jordan Valley, and considered endorsing his political opponent, Benny Gantz. Following Netanyahu&#x27;s congratulations for Joe Biden after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the relationship deteriorated, with Trump accusing him of disloyalty and stating Netanyahu had &quot;made a terrible mistake&quot;.

U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has been friendly with Netanyahu for many years. In November 2011 and in the 2012 U.S. vice presidential debate, Biden stated that the relationship has lasted for 39 years. In March 2010, Netanyahu remarked during a joint statement with Biden during his visit of Israel that their friendship had started almost three decades prior.

== Personal life ==

=== Family tree ===




=== Family and background ===
Netanyahu was born in Tel Aviv, to Benzion Netanyahu (original name Mileikowsky) and Tzila (Cela; née Segal). His mother was born in 1912 in Petah Tikva, then in Ottoman Palestine, now Israel. Though all his grandparents were born in the Russian Empire (now Belarus, Lithuania and Poland), his mother&#x27;s parents emigrated to Minneapolis in the United States. He is related to Rabbi Eliyahu of Vilna (the Vilna Gaon) on his paternal side.

Netanyahu&#x27;s father, Benzion, was a professor of Jewish history at Cornell University, editor of the Encyclopaedia Hebraica, and a senior aide to Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, who remained active in research and writing into his nineties.

Netanyahu&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Nathan Mileikowsky, a leading Zionist rabbi and JNF fundraiser. Netanyahu&#x27;s older brother, Yonatan, was killed in Uganda during Operation Entebbe in 1976. His younger brother, Iddo, is a radiologist and writer. All three brothers served in the Sayeret Matkal reconnaissance unit of the Israel Defense Forces.

=== Marriages and relationships ===

Netanyahu has been married three times and has been involved in multiple extramarital affairs. Netanyahu&#x27;s first marriage was to Miriam Weizmann, whom he met in Israel. Weizmann lived near Yonatan Netanyahu&#x27;s apartment in Jerusalem, where Netanyahu was based during his military service. By the time Netanyahu&#x27;s service was finished, Weizmann had completed her own military service as well as a degree in chemistry from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1972, they both left to study in the United States, where she enrolled in Brandeis University, while Netanyahu studied at MIT. They married soon afterward. The couple had one daughter, Noa (born 29 April 1978).

In 1978, while Weizmann was pregnant, Netanyahu met a non-Jewish British student named Fleur Cates at the university library, and began an affair. His marriage ended in divorce soon after Miriam discovered the affair. In 1981, Netanyahu married Cates, and she converted to Judaism. After moving with Netanyahu to Israel, Cates sued for divorce in 1988.

His third wife, Sara Ben-Artzi, was working as a flight attendant on an El Al flight from New York to Israel when they met. She was in the process of completing a master&#x27;s degree in psychology. The couple married in 1991. They have two sons: Yair (born 26 July 1991), a former soldier in the IDF Spokesperson&#x27;s Unit, and Avner (born 10 October 1994), a national Bible champion, winner of the National Bible Quiz for Youth in Kiryat Shmona, and former soldier in the IDF Combat Intelligence Collection Corps.

In 1993, Netanyahu confessed on live television to having an affair with Ruth Bar, his public relations adviser. He said that a political rival had planted a secret video camera that had recorded him in a sexually compromising position with Bar, and that he had been threatened with the release of the tape to the press unless he quit the Likud leadership race. Netanyahu and Sara repaired their marriage, and he was elected to the leadership of Likud. In 1996, the media reported that he had a 20-year friendship with Katherine Price-Mondadori, an Italian-American woman.

=== Health ===
Netanyahu has been suffering from right bundle branch block (RBBB) since around 2003. On 22 July 2023, a pacemaker was implanted in his body. A hernia was discovered on him in March 2024. In December 2024, his prostate was removed following a urinary tract infection caused by an enlargement.

His personal physician and close friend is the Romanian-born pediatrist Herman Berkovits.

<doc id="56474" wikidata="Q128147" url="?curid=56474" title="Kingston upon Hull">
<text>Kingston upon Hull, usually shortened to Hull, is a historic maritime city and unitary authority area in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It lies upon the River Hull at its confluence with the Humber Estuary, inland from the North Sea. It is a tightly bounded city which excludes the majority of its suburbs, with a population of (), it is the fourth-largest city in the Yorkshire and the Humber region. The built-up area has a population of 436,300.

Hull has more than 800 years of seafaring history and is known as Yorkshire&#x27;s maritime city. The town of Wyke on Hull was founded late in the 12th century by the monks of Meaux Abbey as a port from which to export their wool. Renamed &quot;Kings-town upon Hull&quot; in 1299, Hull had been a market town, military supply port, trading centre, fishing and whaling centre and industrial metropolis.
Hull was an early theatre of battle in the English Civil Wars. Its 18th-century Member of Parliament, William Wilberforce, took a prominent part in the abolition of the slave trade in Britain.

The city offers a variety of museums and art galleries, a city centre marina and historic old town, stunning architecture, and a thriving arts scene. Due to Hull&#x27;s growing appeal as an outdoor film location, particularly for period dramas using the Old Town&#x27;s historic streets and buildings, plans for a purpose-built film studio complex have been approved by Hull City Council. The £3m complex could open by the end of 2025. The city has earned the nickname &quot;Hullywood&quot; in recent years, after productions including &quot;The Crown&quot;, &quot;Enola Holmes 2&quot;, &quot;The Personal History of David Copperfield&quot;, &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Blitz&quot; have been filmed in the city.

In 2017, it was the UK City of Culture and hosted the Turner Prize at the city&#x27;s Ferens Art Gallery. Other notable landmarks in the city are the Minster, the tidal surge barrier, and The Deep Hull&#x27;s award-winning aquarium. Areas of the town centre include the old town (including its museum quarter) and the marina. Hull University was founded in 1927 and had over 16,000 students in 2022. Rugby league football teams include clubs Hull F.C. and Hull Kingston Rovers. The city&#x27;s association football club is Hull City (EFL Championship). Hull RUFC and Hull Ionians both play in the National League 2 North of rugby union.

The city came 2nd in the &quot;Time Out&quot; list of the 15 best places to visit in the UK in 2024, with the guide commenting that the city has got &quot;The Deep, an enormous aquarium with 3,000 species, a picturesque old town which survived the city&#x27;s relentless WWII bombings, and lots of up and coming indie art galleries like Ground and Artlink. Don&#x27;t sleep on Hull&quot;. In 2016, it was named as one of the top 10 cities in the world to visit by Rough Guides alongside cities such as Seoul, Vancouver, Amsterdam and Reykjavik. In 2017, the city was featured in The Sunday Times Best Places to Live Guide and in 2024 was named as one of the UK&#x27;s most &quot;up and coming&quot; places to move to.

==History==
===Wyke and wool trade===
Kingston upon Hull stands on the north bank of the Humber Estuary at the mouth of its tributary, the River Hull. The valley of the River Hull has been inhabited since the early Neolithic period but there is little evidence of a substantial settlement in the area of the present city. The area was attractive to people because it gave access to a prosperous hinterland and navigable rivers but the site was poor, being remote, low-lying and with no fresh water. It was originally an outlying part of the hamlet of Myton, named Wyke. The name is thought to originate either from a Scandinavian word &quot;Vik&quot; meaning inlet or from the Saxon &quot;Wic&quot; meaning dwelling place or refuge.

The River Hull was a good haven for shipping, whose trade included the export of wool from Meaux Abbey, which owned Myton. In 1293, the town of Wyke was acquired from the abbey by King Edward I, who, on 1 April 1299, granted it a royal charter that renamed the settlement &quot;King&#x27;s town upon Hull&quot; or Kingston upon Hull. The charter is preserved in the archives of the Guildhall. When first created, the borough straddled the ancient parishes of Hessle and North Ferriby, but was remote from either parish church. A chapel of ease dedicated to Holy Trinity was built to serve the part of the borough in Hessle parish; that church subsequently became Hull Minster. St Mary&#x27;s Church similarly began as a chapel of ease for the part of the borough in North Ferriby parish.

In 1440, a further charter incorporated the town and instituted local government consisting of a mayor, a sheriff and twelve aldermen.

In his &quot;Guide to Hull (1817)&quot;, J. C. Craggs provides a colourful background to Edward&#x27;s acquisition and naming of the town. He writes that the King and a hunting party started a hare which &quot;led them along the delightful banks of the River Hull to the hamlet of Wyke ... [Edward], charmed with the scene before him, viewed with delight the advantageous situation of this hitherto neglected and obscure corner. He foresaw it might become subservient both to render the kingdom more secure against foreign invasion, and at the same time greatly to enforce its commerce&quot;. Pursuant to these thoughts, Craggs continues, Edward purchased the land from the Abbot of Meaux, had a manor hall built for himself, issued proclamations encouraging development within the town, and bestowed upon it the royal appellation, &quot;King&#x27;s Town&quot;.

===Prospering port===
The port served as a base for Edward I during the First War of Scottish Independence and later developed into the foremost port on the east coast of England. It prospered by exporting wool and woollen cloth, and importing wine and timber. Hull also established a flourishing commerce with the Baltic ports of the Hanseatic League.

From its medieval beginnings, Hull&#x27;s main trading links were with Scotland and northern Europe. Scandinavia, the Baltic and the Low Countries were all key trading areas for Hull&#x27;s merchants. In addition, there was trade with France, Spain and Portugal.

Sir William de la Pole was the town&#x27;s first mayor. A prosperous merchant, de la Pole founded a family that became prominent in government. Another successful son of a Hull trading family was bishop John Alcock, who founded Jesus College, Cambridge and was a patron of the grammar school in Hull. The increase in trade after the discovery of the Americas and the town&#x27;s maritime connections are thought to have played a part in the introduction of a virulent strain of syphilis through Hull and on into Europe from the New World.
The town prospered during the 16th and early 17th centuries, and Hull&#x27;s affluence at this time is preserved in the form of several well-maintained buildings from the period, including Wilberforce House, now a museum documenting the life of William Wilberforce.

During the English Civil War, Hull became strategically important because of the large arsenal located there. Very early in the war, on 11 January 1642, the king named the Earl of Newcastle governor of Hull while Parliament nominated Sir John Hotham and asked his son, Captain John Hotham, to secure the town at once. Sir John Hotham and Hull corporation declared support for Parliament and denied Charles I entry into the town. Charles I responded to these events by besieging the town. This siege helped precipitate open conflict between the forces of Parliament and those of the Royalists.
After the Civil War, docks were built along the route of the town walls, which were demolished. The first dock (1778, renamed Queen&#x27;s Dock in 1854) was built in the area occupied by Beverley and North gates, and the intermediate walls, which were demolished, a second dock (Humber Dock, 1809) was built on the land between Hessle and Myton gates, and a third dock between the two was opened 1829 as Junction Dock (later Prince&#x27;s Dock).

Whaling played a major role in the town&#x27;s fortunes until the mid-19th century. As sail power gave way to steam, Hull&#x27;s trading links extended throughout the world. Docks were opened to serve the frozen meat trade of Australia, New Zealand and South America. Hull was also the centre of a thriving inland and coastal trading network, serving the whole of the United Kingdom.

===City status===
Throughout the second half of the 19th century and leading up to the First World War, the Port of Hull played a major role in the emigration of Northern European settlers to the New World, with thousands of emigrants sailing to Hull and stopping for administrative purposes before travelling on to Liverpool and then North America.

Parallel to this growth in passenger shipping was the emergence of the Wilson Line of Hull (which had been founded in 1825 by Thomas Wilson). By the early 20th century, the company had grown – largely through its monopolisation of North Sea passenger routes and later mergers and acquisitions – to be the largest privately owned shipping company in the world, with over 100 ships sailing to different parts of the globe. The Wilson Line was sold to the Ellerman Lines – which itself was owned by Hull-born magnate (and the richest man in Britain at the time) Sir John Ellerman.

Hull&#x27;s prosperity peaked in the decades just before the First World War; it was during this time, in 1897, that city status was granted. Many of the suburban areas on the western side of Hull were built in the 1930s, particularly Willerby Road and Anlaby Park, as well as most of Willerby itself. 

===Wartime bombing===

The city&#x27;s port and industrial facilities, its proximity to mainland Europe and ease of location being on a big estuary, led to much damage from bombing during the Second World War; much of the city centre was destroyed. Hull had 95 per cent of its houses damaged or destroyed, making it the second most severely bombed British city or town by number of damaged or destroyed buildings, after from London, during the Second World War. More than 1,200 people died in air raids on the city and some 3,000 others were injured.

The worst of the bombing occurred in 1941. Little was known about this destruction by the rest of the country at the time, since most of the radio and newspaper reports did not reveal Hull by name but referred to it as &quot;a North-East town&quot; or &quot;a northern coastal town&quot;. Most of the city centre was rebuilt after the war. In 2006 researchers found documents in the local archives that suggested an unexploded wartime bomb might be buried beneath the Boom, in Hull a redevelopment.

After the decline of the whaling industry after the Second World War, emphasis shifted to deep-sea trawling until the Anglo-Icelandic Cod War of 1975–1976. The conditions set at the end of this dispute started Hull&#x27;s economic decline.

===City of Culture===
In 2017 Hull was awarded the title of &#x27;City of Culture&#x27; by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. There were festivals in public spaces to promote the city and its new title. At the start of the year there was a huge firework display attracting a crowd of 25,000.
==Governance==
===Municipal===

Following the Local Government Act 1888, Hull became a county borough, a local government district independent of the East Riding of Yorkshire. This district was dissolved under the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 when it became a non-metropolitan district of the newly created shire county of Humberside. Humberside (and its county council) was abolished on 1 April 1996 and Hull was made a unitary authority area.

The single-tier local authority of the city is now Hull City Council (officially Kingston upon Hull City Council), headquartered in the Guildhall in the city centre. The council was designated as the UK&#x27;s worst performing authority in both 2004 and 2005, but in 2006 was rated as a two star &#x27;improving adequate&#x27; council and in 2007 it retained its two stars with an &#x27;improving well&#x27; status. In the 2008 corporate performance assessment the city retained its &quot;improving well&quot; status but was upgraded to a three star rating.

The Liberal Democrats won overall control of the City Council in the 2007 local elections, ending several years in which no single party had a majority. They retained control in the 2008 local elections by an increased majority and in the 2010 local elections. Following the UK&#x27;s local elections of 2011, the Labour Party gained control of the council, increasing their majority in the 2012 and retained this following the 2014 local elections. They increased their majority by one in the 2015 local elections, but lost it in the 
2016 local elections. In the 2018 local elections all of the council was up for election following boundary changes that reduced the number of seats by 2. Labour retained control of the council but with a much reduced majority, while in the 2019 local elections there was no change to the make-up of the council. In the 2021 local elections the Liberal Democrats gained a couple of seats but Labour retained control by just three seats. On 3 March 2022, Labour councillor Julia Conner defected to the Liberal Democrats, reducing the Labour majority to one. The Liberal Democrats won overall control of the City Council in the 2022 local elections to end ten years of Labour rule, increasing their majority in the 2023 local elections.

===Parliament===
The city returned three members of parliament to the House of Commons and at the last general election, in 2019, elected three Labour MPs: Emma Hardy, Diana Johnson and Karl Turner.

William Wilberforce is the most celebrated of Hull&#x27;s former MPs. He was a native of the city and the member for Hull from 1780 to 1784 when he was elected as an Independent member for Yorkshire.

==Geography==

Kingston upon Hull is on the northern bank of the Humber Estuary. The city centre is west of the River Hull and close to the Humber. The city is built upon alluvial and glacial deposits which overlie chalk rocks but the underlying chalk has no influence on the topography. The land within the city is generally very flat and is only 2 to 4 metres (6.5 to 13 ft) above sea level. Because of the relative flatness of the site there are few physical constraints upon building and many open areas are the subject of pressures to build.

The parishes of Drypool, Marfleet, Sculcoates, and most of Sutton parish, were absorbed within the borough of Hull in the 19th and 20th centuries. Much of their area has been built over, and socially and economically they have long been inseparable from the city. Only Sutton retained a recognisable village centre in the late 20th century, but on the south and east the advancing suburbs had already reached it. The four villages were, nevertheless, distinct communities, of a largely rural character, until their absorption in the borough—Drypool and Sculcoates in 1837, Marfleet in 1882, and Sutton in 1929. The current boundaries of the city are tightly drawn and exclude many of the metropolitan area&#x27;s nearby villages, of which Cottingham is the largest. The city is surrounded by the rural East Riding of Yorkshire.
Some areas of Hull lie on reclaimed land at or below sea level. The Hull Tidal Surge Barrier is at the point where the River Hull joins the Humber Estuary and is lowered at times when unusually high tides are expected. It is used between 8 and 12 times per year and protects the homes of approximately 10,000 people from flooding. Due to its low level, Hull is expected to be at increasing levels of risk from flooding due to global warming.

Historically, Hull has been affected by tidal and storm flooding from the Humber; the last serious floods were in the 1950s, in 1953, 1954 and the winter of 1959.

Many areas of Hull were flooded during the June 2007 United Kingdom floods, with 8,600 homes and 1,300 businesses affected.

Further flooding occurred in 2013, resulting in a new flood defence scheme to protect homes and businesses, stretching from St Andrews Quay Retail Park to Victoria Dock, linking to other defences at Paull and Hessle. Started in 2016, it was completed in early 2021. The scheme was officially opened on 3 March 2022, by Rebecca Pow.

At around 00:56 GMT on 27 February 2008, Hull was north of the epicentre of an earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter Scale which lasted for nearly 10 seconds. This was an unusually large earthquake for this part of the world. Another notable quake occurred early in the morning of 10 June 2018.

===Climate===
Located in Northern England, Hull has a temperate maritime climate which is dominated by the passage of mid-latitude depressions. The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream makes the region mild for its latitude. Locally, the area is sunnier than most areas this far north in the British Isles, and also considerably drier, due to the rain shadowing effect of the Pennines. It is somewhat warmer than west coast areas at a similar latitude such as Liverpool in summer due to stronger shielding from maritime air but also colder in winter and North Sea breezes keep the city cooler than inland areas during summer. It is also one of the most northerly areas where the July average maximum temperature exceeds , although this appears to be very localised around the city. Flooding in June 2007 caused significant damage to areas of the city. Droughts and heatwaves also occur such as in 2003, 2006 and recently in 2018.

The absolute maximum temperature recorded is , set in July 2022. Typically, the warmest day should reach , though slightly over 10 days should achieve a temperature of or more in an &quot;average&quot; year. All averages refer to the 1991–2020 period.

The absolute minimum temperature is , recorded during January 1982. Winters are generally mild for the latitude with snow only occurring a couple of times a year on average and mostly only staying for a day or two before melting. It is frequently cloudy and the North Sea winds make it feel colder than it actually is. An average of 32.5 nights should report an air frost. Heavy snowfalls do occasionally occur such as in 2010.

On 23 November 1981, during the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak, Hull was struck by two tornadoes which passed through, and caused damage to residential buildings across the north-eastern suburbs of Hull and uprooted trees.

==Demography==

According to the 2001 UK census, Hull had a population of 243,589 living in 104,288 households. The population density was 34.1 per hectare. Of the total number of homes 47.85% were rented compared with a national figure of 31.38% rented. The population had declined by 7.5% since the 1991 UK census, and has been officially estimated as 256,200 in July 2006.

In 2001, approximately 53,000 people were aged under 16, 174,000 were aged 16–74, and 17,000 aged 75 and over. Of the total population 97.7% were white and the largest minority ethnic group was of 749 people who considered themselves to be ethnically Chinese. There were 3% of people living in Hull who were born outside the United Kingdom. In 2006, the largest minority ethnic grouping was Iraqi Kurds who were estimated at 3,000. Most of these people were placed in the city by the Home Office while their applications for asylum were being processed. In 2001, the city was 71.7% Christian. A further 18% of the population indicated they were of no religion while 8.4% did not specify any religious affiliation.

Historically, minorities of many faiths and nationalities have lived around the docks, Old Town and City Centre, coming in from European ports like Hamburg, aided by continental railways and steam-ships from the mid-1800s. Over 2 million passed through Hull between 1850 and 1914, on the way to a new life in America and elsewhere, but some planned or decided to stay. Dutch, Jews, Germans, Scandinavians and others were sometimes prominently involved in the life of the port city. They found opportunity but endured discrimination at times, such that these communities have now largely dispersed.

Also in 2001, the city had a high proportion, at 6.2%, of people of working age who were unemployed, ranking 354th out of 376 local and unitary authorities within England and Wales.

The Seven Seas Fish Trail marks Hull&#x27;s fishing heritage, leading its followers through old and new sections of the city, following a wide variety of sealife engraved in the pavement. Running along Spring Bank there is also an elephant trail, with stone pavers carved by a local artist to the designs of members of the community. This trail commemorates the Victorian Zoological Gardens and the route taken daily by the elephant as it walked from its house down Spring Bank to the zoo and back, stopping for gingerbread at a shop on the way. The animals are further represented on the Albany Street &#x27;Home Zone&#x27; a project involving local residents and resulting in sculptures of a hippo (&#x27;Water Horse&#x27;) at the bottom of Albany Street; an elephant balancing on its trunk on an island in the middle; and two bears climbing poles and reaching out to each other to form an open archway across the entrance to Albany Street from Spring Bank.

====Three Ships mural====
The mural is on a curved screen attached to the end-wall of the old city centre Co-operative store building sited at the intersection where Jameson Street meets King Edward Street, now a mainly pedestrianised area created for the City of Culture 2017.

Built by 1963 and later home to BHS, the building closed in 2016 with the collapse of BHS retail stores and was scheduled for demolition due to asbestos content. The building was listed as Grade II after lobbying by local pressure group Hull Heritage Action Group, potentially preventing demolition of the mural-wall. Specialist spraying to seal the building&#x27;s internal structure has enabled moves to determine the actual level of asbestos in the mural-wall itself and provided a possible solution to incorporate the wall into a new development.

The city has two main theatres. Hull New Theatre, which opened in 1939, with a £16 million refurbishment in 2016–17, is the largest venue which features musicals, opera, ballet, drama, children&#x27;s shows and pantomime.

Hull is close to the Humber Bridge, which provides links to south of the river Humber. It was built between 1972 and 1981, and at that time was the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world. It is, as of 2024, twelfth on the list. Before the bridge was built, those wishing to cross the Humber had to either take a Humber Ferry or travel inland as far as Goole.
In March 2021, a new footbridge was opened connecting the city to Princes Quay waterfront, marina and fruit market over Castle Street, a dual carriageway road also designated A63. Named &quot;Murdoch&#x27;s Connection&quot; after Hull&#x27;s first female doctor, GP Mary Murdoch, the name was nominated by pupils from Newland School for Girls in Newland, Hull. Works began in autumn 2018 but progress was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. There was no opening ceremony due to distancing restrictions; instead, videos were compiled. Members of the public have been requested not to attach love locks.

===Ports===

P&amp;O Ferries provide daily overnight ferry services from King George Dock in Hull to Rotterdam.
Services to Rotterdam are worked by ferries MS &quot;Pride of Rotterdam&quot; and . Previous Services to Zeebrugge were worked by ferries MS &quot;Pride of Bruges&quot; and MS &quot;Pride of York&quot; (previously named ). Both &quot;Pride of Rotterdam&quot; and &quot;Pride of Hull&quot; are too wide to pass through the lock at Hull. Associated British Ports built a new terminal at Hull to accommodate the passengers using these two ferries. The Rotterdam Terminal at the Port of Hull, was built at a cost of £14.3 million. In January 2021, P&amp;O Ferries ceased their overnight ferry to Zeebrugge.

===Airports===
The nearest airport is Humberside Airport, away in Lincolnshire, which provides a few charter flights but also has high-frequency flights to Amsterdam with KLM and Aberdeen with Eastern Airways each day.

The nearest airport with intercontinental flights is Leeds Bradford Airport is away.

===Cycling===
According to the 2001 census data cycling in the city is well above the national average of 2%, with a 12% share of the travel to work traffic. A report by the University of East London in 2011 ranked Hull as the fourth-best cycling city in the United Kingdom.

===Roads===
The main road into and out of Hull is the M62 motorway/A63 road, one of the main east–west routes in Northern England. It provides a link to the cities of Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool, as well as the rest of the country via the UK motorway network. The motorway itself ends some distance from the city; the rest of the route is along the A63 dual carriageway. This east–west route forms a small part of the European road route E20. 

Road transport in Hull suffers from delays caused both by the many bridges over the navigable River Hull, which bisects the city and can cause disruption at busy times. 

The city has three railway level crossings in the city; it formerly had more with bridges built to go over the tracks on Hessle Road in 1962 and Anlaby Road in 1964. A nearby road was renamed from Garrison Road to Roger Millward Way in 2018, after rugby player Roger Millward who played for Hull Kingston Rovers. The developments are part of a wider improvement and redevelopment scheme.

==Infrastructure==

===Telephone system===

Hull is the only city in the UK with its own independent telephone network company, KCOM, formerly KC and Kingston Communications, a subsidiary of KCOM Group. Its distinctive cream telephone boxes can be seen across the city. KCOM produces its own &#x27;White Pages&#x27; telephone directory for Hull and the wider KC area. Colour Pages is KCOM&#x27;s business directory, the counterpart to Yellow Pages. The company was formed in 1902 as a municipal department by the City Council and is an early example of municipal enterprise. It remains the only locally operated telephone company in the UK, although it is now privatised. KCOM&#x27;s Internet brands are Karoo Broadband (ISP serving Hull) and Eclipse (national ISP).
Initially Hull City Council retained a 44.9 per cent interest in the company and used the proceeds from the sale of shares to fund the city&#x27;s sports venue, the MKM Stadium, among other things. On 24 May 2007 it sold its remaining stake in the company for over £107 million.

KCOM (Kingston Communications) was one of the first telecoms operators in Europe to offer ADSL to business users, and the first in the world to run an interactive television service using ADSL, known as Kingston Interactive TV (KiT), which has since been discontinued due to financial problems. In the last decade, the KCOM Group has expanded beyond Hull and diversified its service portfolio to become a nationwide provider of telephone, television, and Internet access services, having close to 180,000 customers projected for 2007. After its ambitious programme of expansion, KCOM has struggled in recent years and now has partnerships with other telecommunications firms such as BT who are contracted to manage its national infrastructure. Telephone House, on Carr Lane, the firm&#x27;s 1960s-built headquarters, in stark modernist style, is a local landmark.

In October 2019, Hull became the first UK city to have full fibre broadband available for all residents.

===Hydraulic power===
The first public hydraulic power network, supplying many companies, was constructed in Hull. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company began operation in 1877, with Edward B. Ellington as its engineer and the main pumping station (now a Grade II listed building) in Catherine Street. Ellington was involved in most British networks, including those in London, Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, but the advent of electrical power combined with wartime damage meant the Hull company was wound up in 1947.

===Public services===
Policing in Kingston upon Hull is provided by Humberside Police. In October 2006 the force was named (jointly with Northamptonshire Police) as the worst-performing police force in the United Kingdom, based on data released from the Home Office. However, after a year of &quot;major improvements&quot;, the Home Office list released in October 2007 shows the force rising several places (although still among the bottom six of 43 forces rated). Humberside Police received ratings of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;fair&quot; in most categories.

HM Prison Hull is located in the city and is operated by HM Prison Service. It caters for up to 1,000 Category B/C adult male prisoners.

Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Humberside Fire and Rescue Service, which has its headquarters near Hessle and five fire stations in Hull. This service was formed in 1974 following local government reorganisation from the amalgamation of the East Riding of Yorkshire County Fire Service, Grimsby Borough Fire and Rescue Service, Kingston Upon Hull City Fire Brigade and part of the Lincoln (Lindsey) Fire Brigade and a small part of the West Riding of Yorkshire County Fire and Rescue Service.

Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust provides healthcare from three sites, Hull Royal Infirmary, Castle Hill Hospital and, until 2008, Princess Royal Hospital and there are several private hospitals including ones run by BUPA and Nuffield Hospitals. The Yorkshire Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport. NHS primary health care services are commissioned by the Hull Clinical Commissioning Group and are provided at several smaller clinics and general practitioner surgeries across the city. NHS Mental health services in Hull are provided by Humber NHS Foundation Trust. It runs a memory clinic in Coltman Street, west Hull designed to help older people with early onset dementia.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority. The Waste Recycling Group is a company which works in partnership with the Hull City and East Riding of Yorkshire councils to deal with the waste produced by residents. The company plans to build an energy from waste plant at Salt End to deal with 240,000 tonnes of rubbish and put waste to a productive use by providing power for the equivalent of 20,000 houses. Hull&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is CE Electric UK (YEDL); there are no power stations in the city. Yorkshire Water manages Hull&#x27;s drinking and waste water. Drinking water is provided by boreholes and aquifers in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and it is abstracted from the River Hull at Tophill Low, near Hutton Cranswick. Should either supply experience difficulty meeting demand, water abstracted from the River Derwent at both Elvington and Loftsome Bridge can be moved to Hull via the Yorkshire water grid. There are many reservoirs in the area for storage of potable and non-potable water. Waste water and sewage has to be transported in a wholly pumped system because of the flat nature of the terrain to a sewage treatment works at Salt End. The treatment works is partly powered by both a wind turbine and a biogas CHP engine.

==Education==
===Higher education===

====University of Hull====

Kingston upon Hull is home to the University of Hull, which was founded in 1927 and received its Royal Charter in 1954. It now has a total student population of around 20,000 across its main campuses in Hull and Scarborough. The main University campus is in North Hull, on Cottingham Road. Notable alumni include former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, social scientist Lord Anthony Giddens, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; presenter and writer Jenni Murray, Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Oxford and co-developer of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine Dame Sarah Gilbert, Nobel Prize laureate and Professor of Economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business Guido Imbens, and the Oscar winning film director Anthony Minghella. The University of Hull is a partner in the new University Centre of the Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education (GIFE) being built in Grimsby, North Lincolnshire.

====University of Lincoln====
The University of Lincoln grew out of the University of Humberside, a former polytechnic based in Hull. In the 1990s the focus of the institution moved to nearby Lincoln and the administrative headquarters and management moved in 2001. The University of Lincoln has retained a campus in George Street in Hull city centre whilst Hull University purchased the adjacent University of Lincoln campus site on Cottingham Road.

===Specialist===
Hull York Medical School is a joint venture between the University of Hull and the University of York. It first admitted students in 2003 as a part of the British government&#x27;s attempts to train more doctors.

The Northern Academy of Performing Arts and Northern Theatre School both provide education in musical theatre, performance and dance.

The Hull School of Art, founded in 1861, is regarded nationally and internationally for its excellence as a specialist creative centre for higher education.

===Colleges===

There is a further education college, Hull College, and two large sixth form colleges, Wyke College and Wilberforce College. East Riding College operates a small adult education campus in the city, and Endeavour Learning and Skills Centre is an adult education provision operated by Hull Training &amp; Adult Education.

===Schools===
Hull has over 100 local schools; of these, Hull City Council supports 14 secondary and 71 primary schools. The highest achieving state school in Hull is Malet Lambert School, Schools which are independent of the City Council include Hymers College and Tranby School. The latter, which is run by the United Church Schools Trust, was formed by the merging of Hull Grammar School and Hull High School. Hull Trinity House Academy has been offering pre-sea training to prospective mariners since 1787, which was a boys only school until September 2022, when it began to admit girls. This left Newland School for Girls the only single-sex school in the city.

The city has had a poor examination success rate for many years and is often at the bottom of government GCSE league tables.
In 2007 the city moved off the bottom of these tables for pupils who achieve five A* to C grades, including English and Maths, at General Certificate of Secondary Education by just one place when it came 149th out of 150 local education authorities. However, the improvement rate of 4.1 per cent, from 25.9 per cent in 2006 to 30 per cent in summer 2007, was among the best in the country.
They returned to the bottom of the table in 2008 when 29.3 per cent achieved five A* to C grades which is well below the national average of 47.2 per cent. There are insufficient places in referral units for school children with special needs or challenging behaviour due to squeezed budgets and cuts to children&#x27;s services.

==Dialect and accent==
The local accent is quite distinctive and noticeably different from the rest of the East Riding; however it is still categorised among Yorkshire accents. The most notable feature of the accent is the strong I-mutation in words like &quot;goat&quot;, which is in standard English and across most of Yorkshire, becomes (&quot;gert&quot;) in and around parts of Hull (cf. similar &quot;refined&quot; pronunciations in Leeds/York), although there is variation across areas and generations.
In common with much of England (outside of the far north), another feature is dropping the H from the start of words, for example Hull is more often pronounced &#x27;Ull in the city. The vowel in &quot;Hull&quot; is pronounced the same way as in northern English, however, and not as the very short that exists in Lincolnshire. Though the rhythm of the accent is more like that of northern Lincolnshire than that of the rural East Riding, which is perhaps due to migration from Lincolnshire to the city during its industrial growth, one feature that it does share with the surrounding rural area is that an sound in the middle of a word often becomes an : for example, &quot;five&quot; may sound like &quot;fahve&quot;, &quot;time&quot; like &quot;tahme&quot;.

The SQUARE–NURSE merger is a feature of Hull&#x27;s dialect. The vowel sound in words such as &quot;burnt, nurse, first&quot; is pronounced with an sound, as is also heard in Middlesbrough and in areas of Liverpool yet this sound is very uncommon in most of Yorkshire. The word pairs spur/spare and fur/fair illustrate this.
The generational and/or geographic variation can be heard in word pairs like pork/poke or cork/coke, or hall/hole, which some people pronounce almost identically, sounding to non-locals like they are using the second of the two variations – while others make more of a vocal distinction; anyone called &quot;Paul&quot; (for example) soon becomes aware of this (pall/pole).

==Notable people==

:&quot;Most of the notable people associated with the city can be found in the People from Kingston upon Hull and People associated with the University of Hull categories.&quot;

People from Hull are called &quot;Hullensians&quot; and the city has been the birthplace and home to many notable people. Amongst those of historic significance with a connection to Hull are former city MP William Wilberforce who was instrumental in the abolition of slavery
and Amy Johnson, aviator who was the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia.

Entertainers from the city include; Dorothy Mackaill, 1950s singer David Whitfield, sports commentator Tony Green, actors Sir Tom Courtenay, Ian Carmichael, John Alderton, actress Maureen Lipman and Reece Shearsmith.

guitarist Mick Ronson and bassist Trevor Bolder, who worked with David Bowie, and more recently 2000s indie band The Paddingtons.

The astrophysicist Edward Arthur Milne and logician John Venn both hailed from Hull. The poet Philip Larkin lived in Hull for 30 years and wrote much of his mature work in the city. An earlier poet, Andrew Marvell represented the city in Parliament during the 17th century. Artist David Remfry RA studied at Hull College of Art before moving to London and New York.

Chemist George Gray, who had a 45-year career at the university, developed the first stable liquid crystals that became an immediate success for the screens of all sorts of electronic gadgets.

Notable sportspeople include Ebenezer Cobb Morley (16 August 1831 – 20 November 1924), an English sportsman who is regarded as the father of the Football Association and modern football. Clive Sullivan, rugby league player, who played for both of Hull&#x27;s professional rugby league teams, was the first black Briton to captain any national representative team. The main A63 road into the city from the Humber Bridge is named after him (Clive Sullivan Way). Nick Barmby played for Tottenham Hotspur, Middlesbrough, Everton, Liverpool, and Leeds United before returning to play for his hometown club Hull City. He also won 23 England caps and played in the famous 5–1 victory over Germany in 2001. Another footballer is Dean Windass, who had two spells with Hull City.

<doc id="56476" wikidata="Q917357" url="?curid=56476" title="Rett syndrome">
<text>Rett syndrome (RTT) is a genetic disorder that typically becomes apparent after 6-18 months of age and almost exclusively in girls. Symptoms include impairments in language and coordination, and repetitive movements. Those affected often have slower growth, difficulty walking, and a smaller head size. Complications of Rett syndrome can include seizures, scoliosis, and sleeping problems. The severity of the condition is variable.
Rett syndrome is due to a genetic mutation in the &quot;MECP2&quot; gene, on the X chromosome. It almost always occurs as a new mutation, with less than one percent of cases being inherited. It occurs almost exclusively in girls; boys who have a similar mutation typically die shortly after birth. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and can be confirmed with genetic testing.
There is no known cure for Rett syndrome. Treatment is directed at improving symptoms. Anticonvulsants may be used to help with seizures. Special education, physiotherapy, and leg braces may also be useful depending on the needs of the child. Many of those with the condition live into middle age.
The condition affects about 1 in 8,500 females. In 1999, Lebanese-American physician Huda Zoghbi discovered the mutation that causes the condition.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Stage I===
Stage I, called early-onset, typically begins between 6 and 18 months of age. This stage is often overlooked because symptoms of the disorder may be somewhat vague, and parents and doctors may not notice the subtle slowing of development at first. The infant may begin to show less eye contact and have reduced interest in toys. There may be delays in gross motor skills such as sitting or crawling. Hand-wringing and decreasing head growth may occur, but not enough to draw attention. This stage usually lasts for a few months but can continue for more than a year.

===Stage II===
Stage II, or the rapid destructive stage, usually begins between ages 1 and 4 and may last for weeks or months. Its onset may be rapid or gradual as the child loses purposeful hand skills and spoken language. Characteristic hand movements such as wringing, washing, clapping, or tapping, as well as repeatedly moving the hands to the mouth often begin during this stage which is called mouthing. The child may hold the hands clasped behind the back or held at the sides, with random touching, grasping, and releasing. The movements continue while the child is awake but disappear during sleep. Breathing irregularities such as episodes of apnea and hyperventilation may occur, although breathing usually improves during sleep. Some girls also display autistic-like symptoms such as loss of social interaction and communication. Walking may be unsteady and initiating motor movements can be difficult. Slowed head growth is usually noticed during this stage.

===Stage III===
Stage III, or the plateau or pseudo-stationary stage, usually begins between ages 2 and 10 and can last for years. Apraxia, motor problems, and seizures are prominent during this stage. However, there may be improvement in behavior, with less irritability, crying, and autistic-like features. In stage III there may be more interest in the surroundings and alertness, attention span, and communication skills may improve. Many girls remain in this stage for most of their lives.

===Stage IV===
Stage IV, or the late motor deterioration stage, can last for years or decades. Prominent features include reduced mobility, curvature of the spine, and muscle weakness, rigidity, spasticity, and increased muscle tone with abnormal posturing of an arm or leg. Girls who were previously able to walk may stop walking. Cognition, communication, or hand skills generally do not decline in stage IV. Repetitive hand movements may decrease and eye gaze usually improves.

===Variants===
The signs and symptoms of the typical form of the Rett syndrome are well described.
In addition to the classical form of Rett syndrome, several atypical forms have been described over the years; the main groups are:
* Congenital variant (Rolando variant): in this severe subtype of Rett syndrome, the development of the patients and their head circumference are abnormal from birth. The typical gaze of Rett syndrome patients is usually absent;
* Zappella variant of Rett Syndrome or preserved speech variant: in this subtype of Rett syndrome the patients acquire some manual skills and language is partially recovered around the age of 5 years (that is after the regression phase). Height, weight and head circumference are often in the normal range, and a good gross motor function can be observed. The Zappella variant is a milder form of Rett syndrome;
* Hanefeld variant or early epilepsy variant. In this form of Rett syndrome, the patients have epilepsy before 5 months of age.
The definition itself of the Rett syndrome has been refined over the years: as the atypical forms subsist near to the classical form (Hagberg &amp; Gillberg, 1993), the &quot;Rett Complex&quot; terminology has been introduced.

==Cause==
Genetically, Rett syndrome (RTT) is often caused by mutations in the gene MECP2 located on the X chromosome (which is involved in transcriptional silencing and epigenetic regulation of methylated DNA), and can arise sporadically or from germline mutations. In less than 10% of RTT cases, mutations in the genes CDKL5 or FOXG1 have also been found to resemble it. Rett syndrome is initially diagnosed by clinical observation, and is commonly associated with a genetic defect in the MECP2 gene.

It has been argued that Rett syndrome is in fact a neurodevelopmental condition as opposed to a neurodegenerative condition. One piece of evidence for this is that mice with induced Rett syndrome show no neuronal death, and some studies have suggested that their phenotypes can be partially rescued by adding functional MECP2 gene back when they are adults. This information has also helped lead to further studies aiming to treat the disorder.

===Sporadic mutations===

In at least 95% of Rett syndrome cases, the cause is a &quot;de novo&quot; mutation in the child, almost exclusively from a de novo mutation on the male copy of the X chromosome. It is not yet known what causes the sperm to mutate, and such mutations are rare.

===Germline mutations===
It can also be inherited from phenotypically normal mothers who have a germline mutation in the gene encoding &quot;methyl-CpG-binding protein-2&quot;, MeCP2. In these cases, inheritance follows an X-linked dominant pattern and is seen almost exclusively in females, as most males die &quot;in utero&quot; or shortly after birth. MECP2 is found near the end of the long arm of the X chromosome at Xq28. An atypical form of RTT, characterized by infantile spasms or early onset epilepsy, can also be caused by a mutation to the gene encoding &quot;cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5&quot; (CDKL5). As stated by Aine Merwick, Margaret O&#x27;Brien, and Norman Delanty in an article on gene disorders titled &quot;Complex single gene disorders and epilepsy&quot;, &quot;Rett syndrome affects one in every 12,500 female live births by age 12 years.&quot;

==Mechanism==
===Pontine noradrenergic deficits===
Brain levels of norepinephrine are lower in people with Rett syndrome (reviewed in). The genetic loss of &quot;MECP2&quot; changes the properties of cells in the locus coeruleus, the exclusive source of noradrenergic innervation to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These changes include hyperexcitability and decreased functioning of its noradrenergic innervation. Moreover, a reduction of the tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) mRNA level, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, was detected in the whole pons of &quot;MECP2&quot;-null male as well as in adult heterozygous (&quot;MECP2&quot;+/-) female mice. Using immunoquantitative techniques, a decrease of Th protein staining level, number of locus coeruleus Th-expressing neurons and density of dendritic arborization surrounding the structure was shown in symptomatic &quot;MeCP2&quot;-deficient mice. However, locus coeruleus cells are not dying, but are more likely losing their fully mature phenotype, since no apoptotic neurons in the pons were detected.

Researchers have concluded that &quot;Because these neurons are a pivotal source of norepinephrine throughout the brainstem and forebrain and are involved in the regulation of diverse functions disrupted in Rett syndrome, such as respiration and cognition, we hypothesize that the locus coeruleus is a critical site at which loss of &quot;MECP2&quot; results in CNS dysfunction.&quot; The restoration of normal locus coeruleus function may therefore be of potential therapeutic value in the treatment of Rett syndrome.

===Midbrain dopaminergic disturbances===
The majority of dopamine in the mammalian brain is synthesized by nuclei located in the mesencephalon. The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the retrorubral field (RRF) contain dopaminergic neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (Th, i.e. the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis).

The nigro-striatal pathway originates from the SNpc; its principal rostral target is the caudate-putamen (CPu), which it irradiates through the median forebrain bundle (MFB). This connection is involved in the tight modulation of motor strategies computed by a cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.

Indeed, based on the canonical anatomofunctional model of basal ganglia, nigrostriatal dopamine is able to modulate the motor loop by acting on dopaminergic receptors located on striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons.

Dysregulation of the nigrostriatal pathway is causative from Parkinson disease (PD) in humans. Toxic and/or genetic ablation of SNpc neurons produces experimental parkinsonism in mice and primates. The common features of PD and PD animal models are motor impairments (hypotonia, bradykinesia, hypokinesia).

RTT pathology, in some aspects, overlaps the motor phenotype observed in PD patients. Several neuropathological studies on postmortem brain samples argued for an SNpc alteration, evidenced by neuromelanin hypopigmentation, reduction in the structure area, and even, controversially, signs of apoptosis. In parallel, a hypometabolism was underlined by a reduction of several catecholamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline) and their principal metabolic by-products. Mouse models of RTT are available; the most studied are constitutively deleted &quot;Mecp2&quot; mice developed by Adrian Bird or Katelyn McCormick laboratories.

In accordance with the motor spectrum of the RTT phenotype, &quot;Mecp2&quot;-null mice show motor abnormalities from postnatal day 30 that worsen until death. These models offer a crucial substrate to elucidate the molecular and neuroanatomical correlates of &quot;MeCP2&quot;-deficiency. Recently (2008), it was shown that the conditional deletion of &quot;Mecp2&quot; in catecholaminergic neurons (by crossing of Th-Cre mice with loxP-flanked &quot;Mecp2&quot; ones) recapitulates a motor symptomatology; it was further documented that brain levels of Th in mice lacking &quot;MeCP2&quot; in catecholaminergic neurons only are reduced, participating to the motor phenotype.

However, the most studied model for the evaluation of therapeutics is the &quot;Mecp2&quot;-null mouse (totally devoid of &quot;MeCP2&quot;). In this context, a reduction in the number and soma size of Th-expressing neurons is present from 5 weeks of age and is accompanied by a decrease of Th immunoreactivity in the caudate-putamen, the principal target of dopaminergic neurons arising from the SNpc. Moreover, a neurochemical analysis of dopaminergic contents in microdissected midbrain and striatal areas revealed a reduction of dopamine at five and nine weeks of age. It is noteworthy that later on (at nine weeks), the morphological parameters remain altered but not worsened, whereas the phenotype progresses and behavioral deficits are more severe. The amount of fully activated Th (Serine40-phosphorylated isoform) in neurons that remain in the SNpc is mildly affected at 5 weeks but severely impaired by 9 weeks. Finally, using a chronic and oral L-Dopa treatment on &quot;MeCP2&quot;-deficient mice, authors reported an amelioration of some of the motor deficits previously identified. Altogether, these results argue for an alteration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in &quot;MeCP2&quot;-deficient animals as a contributor of the neuromotor deficits.

There is an association of Rett syndrome with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

===Molecular functions of MECP2 in Rett syndrome pathology===
As reviewed by Sharifi and Yasui, MECP2 protein, encoded by the &quot;MECP2&quot; gene binds to DNA with a high affinity for CpG methylated DNA sites and affects transcription. MECP2 can bind to 5mc (5-methylcytosine) and 5hmc (5-hydroxymethylcytosine) with similar affinity, and these dinucleotides account for the majority of MECP2 binding sites in the mammalian genome. MECP2 is involved in higher order chromatin organization and appears necessary for compacting chromosomes. MECP2 binding to DNA influences mRNA splicing events. MECP2 also appears to function in DNA repair processes. &quot;MECP2-/+&quot; deficient female mice have elevated rates of cell death when exposed to DNA damaging agents and are prone to early senescence.

==Diagnosis==

Prior to the discovery of a genetic cause, Rett syndrome had been designated as a pervasive developmental disorder by the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM), together with the autism spectrum disorders. Some argued against this conclusive assignment because RTT resembles non-autistic disorders such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, or Down syndrome that also exhibit autistic features.
After research proved the molecular mechanism, in 2013 the DSM-5 removed the syndrome altogether from classification as a mental disorder.

Rett syndrome diagnosis involves close observation of the child&#x27;s growth and development to observe any abnormalities in regards to developmental milestones. A diagnosis is considered when decreased head growth is observed. Conditions with similar symptoms must first be ruled out.

There are certain criteria that must be met for the diagnosis. A blood test can rule in or rule out the presence of the MECP2 mutation, however, this mutation is present in other conditions as well.

For a classic diagnosis, all four criteria for ruling in a diagnosis must be met, as well as the two criteria for ruling out a diagnosis. Supportive criteria may also be present, but are not required for diagnosis. For an atypical or variant diagnosis, at least two of the four criteria for ruling in the diagnosis must be met, as well as five of the eleven supportive criteria. A period of symptom regression followed by recovery or symptom stabilization must also occur. Children are often misdiagnosed as having autism, cerebral palsy, or another form of developmental delay. A positive test for the MECP2 mutation is not enough to make a diagnosis.

Ruling in
* Decreased or loss of use of fine motor skills
* Decreased or loss of verbal speech
* Abnormalities during gait
* Repetitive hand movements such as wringing/squeezing or clapping/tapping
Ruling out
* Traumatic or anoxic/hypoxic brain injury, neurometabolic disease, or severe infection that may better explain symptoms
* Abnormal psychomotor development during the first six months of life

Supportive criteria
* Breathing disturbances when awake
* Bruxism while awake
* Impaired sleep pattern
* Abnormal muscle tone
* Peripheral vasomotor disturbances
* Scoliosis/kyphosis
* Growth retardation
* Small cold hands and feet
* Inappropriate laughing/screaming spells
* Diminished response to pain
* Intense eye communication (eye pointing)

==Treatment==

There is no cure for Rett syndrome. Treatment is directed towards improving function and addressing symptoms. A multi-disciplinary team approach is typically used to treat the person throughout life. This team may include a primary care physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist, nutritionist, and support services in academic and occupational settings. Some children may require special equipment and aids such as braces to arrest scoliosis, splints to modify hand movements, and nutritional programs to help them maintain adequate weight.

Because of the increased risk of sudden cardiac death, when long QT syndrome is found on an annual screening EKG it is treated with an anti-arrhythmic such as a beta-blocker. There is some evidence that phenytoin may be more effective than a beta-blocker.

While medicinal interventions to mitigate breathing challenges in children with Rett Syndrome (RTT) are still being developed, children with RTT may be prescribed rebreathing techniques (e.g., rebreathing masks), oxygen delivery, or non-invasive ventilation as preventative or rescue breathing treatments. High oxidative stress levels in individuals with RTT have exacerbated effects on their cardiorespiratory health and functionality, dramatically increasing the risk for sudden cardiac death—an anomaly that has an associated 300x increased occurrence risk in children with Rett Syndrome. Due to this, it is vital to closely monitor atypical breathing behaviors in children with RTT, making sure to effectively use lifesaving respiratory improvement devices and strategies as prescribed.  

Prescribed treatment methods may vary depending on the breathing characteristic phenotype expressed by the child. Physicians have identified three major RTT breathing phenotypes; forceful breathers, feeble breathers, and apneustic breathers. For forceful breathers, for example, rebreathing masks may be used while the child is awake.

==Prognosis==
Male fetuses with the disorder rarely survive to term. Because the disease-causing gene is located on the X chromosome, a female born with an MECP2 mutation on her X chromosome has another X chromosome with an ostensibly normal copy of the same gene, while a male with the mutation on his X chromosome has no other X chromosome, only a Y chromosome; thus, he has no normal gene. Without a normal gene to provide normal proteins in addition to the abnormal proteins caused by a MECP2 mutation, the XY karyotype male fetus is unable to slow the development of the disease, hence the failure of many male fetuses with a MECP2 mutation to survive to term. Males with pathogenic &quot;MECP2&quot; mutations usually die within the first 2 years from severe encephalopathy, unless they have one or more extra X chromosomes, or have somatic mosaicism.

Females with a MECP2 mutation, however, have a non-mutant chromosome that provides them enough normal protein to survive longer. Research shows that males with Rett syndrome may result from Klinefelter&#x27;s syndrome, in which the male has an XXY karyotype. Thus, a non-mutant &quot;MECP2&quot; gene is necessary for a Rett&#x27;s-affected embryo to survive in most cases, and the embryo, male or female, must have another X chromosome.

There have, however, been several cases of 46,XY karyotype males with a MECP2 mutation (associated with classical Rett syndrome in females) carried to term, who were affected by neonatal encephalopathy and died before 2 years of age. The incidence of Rett syndrome in males is unknown, partly owing to the low survival of male fetuses with the Rett syndrome-associated MECP2 mutations, and partly to differences between signs caused by MECP2 mutations and those caused by Rett&#x27;s.

Females can live up to 40 years or more. Laboratory studies on Rett syndrome may show abnormalities such as:
* EEG abnormalities from 2 years of age
* atypical brain glycolipids
* elevated CSF levels of &quot;beta&quot;-endorphin and glutamate
* reduction of substance P
* decreased levels of CSF nerve growth factors

A high proportion of deaths are abrupt, but most have no identifiable cause; in some instances death is the result most likely of:
* spontaneous brainstem dysfunction
* cardiac arrest, likely due to long QT syndrome, ventricular tachycardia or other arrhythmias
* seizures
* gastric perforation

==History==
Andreas Rett, a pediatrician in Vienna Austria, first described the condition in 1966. As his writings were in German, they did not become widely known in the English-speaking world. Bengt Hagberg, a Swedish pediatrician, published an English article in 1983 and named the condition after Rett. In 1999, Lebanese-American physician Huda Zoghbi discovered the mutation that causes the condition.

==Research==
Gene therapy is under study in animal models to achieve regulated expression of a normal MECP2 gene. In March 2022, Taysha Gene Therapies announced that they had received Clinical Trial Application (CTA) approval from Health Canada for a clinical trial of their investigational gene therapy for adult females with Rett Syndrome.

<text>North is one of the four compass points or cardinal directions. It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west. &quot;North&quot; is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography. 

==Etymology==
The word &quot;north&quot; is related to the Old High German &quot;nord&quot;, both descending from the Proto-Indo-European unit *&quot;ner-&quot;, meaning &quot;left; below&quot; as north is to left when facing the rising sun. Similarly, the other cardinal directions are also related to the sun&#x27;s position.

The Latin word &quot;borealis&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;boreas&quot; &quot;north wind, north&quot; which, according to Ovid, was personified as the wind-god Boreas, the father of Calais and Zetes. &quot;Septentrionalis&quot; is from &quot;septentriones&quot;, &quot;the seven plow oxen&quot;, a name of &quot;Ursa Major&quot;. The Greek ἀρκτικός (&quot;arktikós&quot;) is named for the same constellation, and is the source of the English word &quot;Arctic&quot;.

Other languages have other derivations. For example, in Lezgian, &quot;kefer&quot; can mean both &quot;disbelief&quot; and &quot;north&quot;, since to the north of the Muslim Lezgian homeland there are areas formerly inhabited by non-Muslim Caucasian and Turkic peoples. In many languages of Mesoamerica, &quot;north&quot; also means &quot;up&quot;. 

In Romanian the old word for north is &quot;mĭazănoapte&quot;, from Latin &quot;mediam noctem&quot; meaning &quot;midnight&quot; and in 
Hungarian is &quot;észak&quot;, which is derived from &quot;éjszaka&quot; (&quot;night&quot;), since between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle the Sun never shines from the north.

North is sometimes abbreviated as N.

==Mapping and navigation==
By convention, the &quot;top or upward-facing&quot; side of a map is north.

To go north using a compass for navigation, set a bearing or azimuth of 0° or 360°. Traveling directly north traces a meridian line upwards.

North is specifically the direction that, in Western culture, is considered &quot;the&quot; fundamental direction:
* North is used (explicitly or implicitly) to define all other directions.
* The (visual) top edges of maps usually correspond to the northern edge of the area represented, unless explicitly stated otherwise or landmarks are considered more useful for that territory than specific directions.
* On any rotating astronomical object, &quot;north&quot; often denotes the side appearing to rotate counterclockwise when viewed from afar along the axis of rotation. However, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines the geographic north pole of a planet or any of its satellites in the Solar System as the planetary pole that is in the same celestial hemisphere, relative to the invariable plane of the Solar System, as Earth&#x27;s north pole. This means some objects, such as Uranus, rotate in the retrograde direction: when seen from the IAU north, the spin is clockwise.

==Magnetic north and declination==
Magnetic north is of interest because it is the direction indicated as north on a properly functioning (but uncorrected) magnetic compass. The difference between it and true north is called the magnetic declination (or simply the declination where the context is clear). For many purposes and physical circumstances, the error in direction that results from ignoring the distinction is tolerable; in others a mental or instrument compensation, based on assumed knowledge of the applicable declination, can solve all the problems. But simple generalizations on the subject should be treated as unsound, and as likely to reflect popular misconceptions about terrestrial magnetism.

Maps intended for usage in orienteering by compass will clearly indicate the local declination for easy correction to true north. Maps may also indicate grid north, which is a navigational term referring to the direction northwards along the grid lines of a map projection.

==Roles of north as prime direction==
The visible rotation of the night sky around the visible celestial pole provides a vivid metaphor of that direction corresponding to &quot;up&quot;. Thus the choice of the north as corresponding to &quot;up&quot; in the northern hemisphere, or of south in that role in the southern, is, before worldwide communication, anything but an arbitrary one - at least for night-time astronomers. (Note: the southern hemisphere lacks a prominent visible analog to the northern Pole Star.) On the contrary, Chinese and Islamic cultures considered south as the proper &quot;top&quot; end for maps. In the cultures of Polynesia, where navigation played an important role, winds - prevailing local or ancestral - can define cardinal points.

In Western culture:
* Maps tend to be drawn for viewing with either true north or magnetic north at the top.
* Globes of the earth have the North Pole at the top, or if the Earth&#x27;s axis is represented as inclined from vertical (normally by the angle it has relative to the axis of the Earth&#x27;s orbit), in the top half.
* Maps are usually labelled to indicate which direction on the map corresponds to a direction on the earth,
** usually with a single arrow oriented to the map&#x27;s representation of true north,
** occasionally with a single arrow oriented to the map&#x27;s representation of magnetic north, or two arrows oriented to true and magnetic north respectively,
** occasionally with a compass rose, but if so, usually on a map with north at the top and usually with north decorated more prominently than any other compass point.
* &quot;Up&quot; is a metaphor for north. The notion that north should always be &quot;up&quot; and east at the right was established by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy. The historian Daniel Boorstin suggests that perhaps this was because the better-known places in his world were in the northern hemisphere, and on a flat map these were most convenient for study if they were in the upper right-hand corner.

North is quite often associated with colder climates because most of the world&#x27;s populated land at high latitudes is located in the Northern Hemisphere. The Arctic Circle passes through the Arctic Ocean, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut), Denmark (Greenland) and Iceland.

==Roles of east and west as inherently subsidiary directions==
While the choice of north over south as prime direction reflects quite arbitrary historical factors, east and west are not nearly as natural alternatives as first glance might suggest. Their folk definitions are, respectively, &quot;where the sun rises&quot; and &quot;where it sets&quot;. Except on the Equator, however, these definitions, taken together, would imply that
* east and west would not be 180 degrees apart, but instead would differ from that by up to twice the degrees of latitude of the location in question, and
* they would each move slightly from day to day and, in the temperate zones, markedly over the course of the year.

Reasonably accurate folk astronomy, such as is usually attributed to Stone Age peoples or later Celts, would arrive at east and west by noting the directions of rising and setting (preferably more than once each) and choosing as prime direction one of the two mutually opposite directions that lie halfway between those two. The true folk-astronomical definitions of east and west are &quot;the directions, a right angle from the prime direction, that are closest to the rising and setting, respectively, of the sun (or moon).

==Cultural references==
Being the &quot;default&quot; direction on the compass, north is referred to frequently in Western popular culture. Some examples include:

* &quot;North of X&quot; is a phrase often used by Americans to mean &quot;more than X&quot; or &quot;greater than X&quot; in relation to the conventional direction of north being upwards, i.e. &quot;The world population is north of 7 billion people&quot; or &quot;north of 40 [years old]&quot;.

<doc id="56479" wikidata="Q846241" url="?curid=56479" title="Theaetetus (dialogue)">
<text>The Theaetetus (; &quot;Theaítētos&quot;, lat. &quot;Theaetetus&quot;) is a philosophical work written by Plato in the early-middle 4th century BCE that investigates the nature of knowledge, and is considered one of the founding works of epistemology. Like many of Plato&#x27;s works, the &quot;Theaetetus&quot; is written in the form of a dialogue, in this case between Socrates and the young mathematician Theaetetus and his teacher Theodorus of Cyrene. 
In the dialogue, Socrates and Theaetetus attempt to come up with a definition of &quot;episteme&quot;, or knowledge, and discuss three definitions of knowledge: knowledge as nothing but &quot;perception&quot;, knowledge as &quot;true judgment&quot;, and, finally, knowledge as a &quot;true judgment with an account.&quot; Each of these definitions is shown to be unsatisfactory as the dialogue ends in aporia as Socrates leaves to face a hearing for his trial for impiety.

As one of the major works of Plato&#x27;s theory of knowledge, the &quot;Theaetetus&quot; was influential on Platonism from at least the time of the Skeptical Academy of the 3rd century BCE through the Neoplatonism of the 6th century CE. It has also been the subject of increased attention in modern times as a result of its influence on Edmund Gettier, who challenged the existing definitions of knowledge as a &quot;justified true belief&quot; in a paper that investigated Plato&#x27;s theory of knowledge as outlined in this work.

== Date and setting ==
The &quot;Theaetetus&quot; is one of the few works of Plato that gives contextual clues on the timeline of its authorship: The dialogue is framed by a brief scene in which Euclid of Megara and his friend Terpsion witness a wounded Theataetus returning on his way home after from fighting in an Athenian battle at Corinth, from which he apparently died of his wounds. Euclid tells his friend that he has a written record of a dialogue between Socrates and Theaetetus, which occurred when Theaetetus was quite a young man. The dialogue is then read aloud to the two men by a slave owned by Euclid.

The exact timeline of which battle at Corinth has been a matter of some disagreement between scholars: it has generally been presumed that the battle occurred in 369 BC; when Theaetetus would have been in his late forties, but more recently, scholars including Debra Nails have argued that the battle referenced in the dialogue was a different battle in Corinth that occurred much earlier, in 391 BC, when Theatetus would have been in his late 20s. 

As far as internal characteristics, the dialogue is considered to be similar to the &quot;earlier&quot; dialogues of Plato, such as the &quot;Euthyphro&quot; or the &quot;Crito&quot;, in that Plato&#x27;s Socrates discusses the nature of knowledge in the Theaetetus without giving any of his own views, and the dialogue ultimately ends in aporia without a satisfying answer. However, it also resembles many of the more philosophically complex &quot;later&quot; dialogues such as &quot;Parmenides&quot;, &quot;Phaedrus&quot; and the dialogues &quot;Sophist&quot; and &quot;Statesman&quot; which serve as a narrative sequel.

==Characters of the dialogue==
* Euclid of Megara - the founder of the Megarian school of philosophy, a student of Socrates and contemporary of Plato.
* Terpsion - a friend of Euclid who is unknown outside of this dialogue, although later fables about him, that were likely written on the basis of this dialogue are preserved by Plutarch and in the Cynic epistles.
* Socrates - the famous teacher of Plato, who was executed by the people of Athens in 399 BC. In the dialogue, which takes place just before Socrates visits the Palace of the King Archon for his trial, Socrates is an old man of about 70.
* &quot;Theodorus&quot; - a Greek mathematician from Cyrene, a prosperous Greek colony on the coast of North Africa, in what is now Libya, on the eastern end of the Gulf of Sidra. Theodorus explored the theory of incommensurable quantities, and according to Diogenes Laertius, was said to have taught mathematics to Plato, although the historicity of this claim cannot be verified.
* &quot;Theaetetus&quot; - A Greek mathematician from Athens, who is credited in Book X of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; with developing a method for measuring irrational lengths in terms of square roots, as well as the proof that there are precisely five regular convex polyhedra. According to the dialogue, he evidently resembled Socrates in the snubness of his nose and bulging of his eyes. He apparently died from wounds and dysentery after the battle in Corinth that occurs in the frame story of the dialogue. 

Socrates, Theaetetus, and Theodorus reappear the following day in the &quot;Sophist&quot; an apparent continuation of the conversation contained within the book of Euclid, where they are also joined by an unnamed Eleatic stranger and a boy also named Socrates.

==Outline==
The narrative of the dialogue is set in a wrestling school. Socrates asks Theodorus if he knows of any geometry students who show particular promise. Theodorus assures him that he does, but that he does not want to over-praise the boy, lest anyone suspect he is in love with him. He says that the boy, Theaetetus, is a young Socrates look-alike, rather homely, with a snub-nose and protruding eyes. The two older men spot Theaetetus rubbing himself down with oil, and Theodorus reviews the facts about him, that he is intelligent, virile, and an orphan whose inheritance has been squandered by trustees. Socrates declares Theaetetus will have benefited from discovering what he does not know, and that he may be better able to approach the topic in the future. The conversation ends with Socrates&#x27; announcement that he has to go to court to face a criminal indictment.

Socrates tells Theaetetus that he cannot make out what knowledge is, and is looking for a simple formula for it. Theaetetus says he really has no idea how to answer the question, and Socrates tells him that he is there to help. Socrates says he has modelled his career after his midwife mother. She delivered babies and for his part, Socrates can tell when a young man is in the throes of trying to give birth to a thought. Socrates considers his philosophical work as midwifery (Maieutics). This method, later also called Socratic method, consists in eliciting knowledge by a series of questions and answers.
=== Protagoras&#x27; theory of knowledge ===
Socrates thinks that the idea that knowledge is perception must be identical in meaning, if not in actual words, to Protagoras&#x27; famous maxim &quot;Man is the measure of all things.&quot; 

Socrates wrestles to conflate the two ideas, and stirs in for good measure a claim about Homer being the captain of a team of Heraclitan flux theorists. Socrates dictates a complete textbook of logical fallacies to the bewildered Theaetetus. When Socrates tells the child that he (Socrates) will later be smaller &quot;without losing an inch&quot; because Theaetetus will have grown relative to him, the child complains of dizziness . In an often quoted line, Socrates says with delight that &quot;wonder (thaumazein) belongs to the philosopher&quot;. He admonishes the boy to be patient and bear with his questions, so that his hidden beliefs may be yanked out into the bright light of day. When Socrates sums up what they have agreed on so far, it becomes problematic that knowledge is sense perception, for Socrates raises the question that &quot;When the same wind blows, one of us feels cold and the other not?&quot; As a result, he introduces the idea of Heraclitean flux to act as a defense to the wind objection. Heracliteanism shows that &quot;Nothing is in itself just one thing...Everything is in a process of coming to be&quot;. Thus as there is no fixed meaning in things, but they draw their meaning in a referential difference to other things, the wind objection can be incorporated into Theaetetus&#x27;s claim that &quot;Knowledge is sense perception&quot;. As a result, they can then continue their inquiry as to the truth of this claim. It is important to note that the Heraclitean doctrine of Flux is not the same as the Protagorean doctrine. The Protagorean is radical truth relativism whereas the Heraclitean is radical reality relativism. It serves as a supporting theory to the Protagorean interpretation of Theaetetus&#x27;s claim, in order that they might fully inquire as to the validity of this premise. Socrates admits that it is unfortunate that Protagoras is dead and cannot defend his idea against people such as himself. He says that the two of them are &quot;trampling on his orphan&quot; but the charge remains. Since Protagoras is dead, Socrates puts himself in the sophist&#x27;s shoes and tries to do him the favor of defending his idea. Socrates concedes that if Protagoras were still alive, he would have more to say in his own defense, and that they are now essentially mistreating &quot;his orphan child.&quot; Putting words in the dead sophist&#x27;s mouth, Socrates declares that Protagoras asserts with his maxim that all things are in motion and whatever seems to be the case, is the case for the perceiver, whether the individual or the state. At the end of his speech, Socrates admits to Theodorus that Protagoras would have done a far better job of defending his own ideas. Theodorus tells Socrates that he must be kidding, that he has come to the task with boyish vigor. Theodorus does not claim to be a disciple of Protagoras, but states that he was a friend. Socrates invites Theodorus to put up a more vigorous defense of Protagoras, as he does not want it suggested that he has used the child&#x27;s timidity (of Theaetetus) to aid him in his argument against the doctrine of Protagoras.. Socrates, not at all certain that he has not misrepresented Protagoras in making each man the measure of his own wisdom, presses Theodorus on the question of whether any follower of Protagoras (himself included) would contend that nobody thinks anyone else is wrong. Theodorus proves to be helpless against Socrates&#x27; arguments. He agrees that Protagoras concedes that those who disagree with him are correct. In making Protagoras a complete epistemological relativist, where every person&#x27;s individual perceptions are his reality and his truth, both Socrates and Theodorus paint Protagoras as maintaining an absurd position.
Socrates then proceeds to explain why philosophers seem clumsy and stupid to the common lot of humanity. Socrates explains that philosophers are open to mockery because they are not concerned about what interests most people: they could not care less about the scandals in their neighbor&#x27;s house, the tracing of one&#x27;s ancestry to Heracles, and so on. In contrast, the philosopher is concerned with things that &quot;are&quot;, such as beauty and knowledge, which are &quot;truly higher up&quot;. It is here that Socrates draws the classic portrait of the absent-minded intellectual who cannot make his bed or cook a meal (175e). Socrates adds a big bifurcation to this speech, saying that there are only two kinds of lives to be lived: a divinely happy one, lived by righteous philosophers or a godless, miserable one, such as most people live. Socrates admits this was a digression that threatens to drown his original project, which was to define knowledge. Theodorus, the old geometer, tells Socrates that he finds this sort of thing easier to follow than his earlier arguments. Socrates says that the men of flux, like Homer and Heraclitus, are really hard to talk to because you can&#x27;t pin them down. When you ask them a question, he says, they pluck from their quiver a little aphorism to let fly at you, and as you try to figure that one out, they wing another one at you. They leave nothing settled either in discourse, or in their own minds. Socrates adds that the opposite school of thought, that teaches of the &quot;immovable whole&quot; is just as hard to talk to. Socrates says he met the father of the idea, Parmenides, when he was quite young, but does not want to get into another digression over it.

===Definitions of knowledge===

Socrates compares the human mind to an aviary. Socrates draws the distinction between &quot;having&quot; and &quot;possessing&quot;; the former typically implies the latter, though on the other hand, one can possess something, such as a bird, without actually having it (with them at any moment). Socrates says that as a man goes hunting about in his mind for knowledge of something, he might grab hold of the wrong thing. He says that mistaking &quot;eleven&quot; for &quot;twelve&quot; is like going in for a pigeon and coming up with a dove, Theaetetus joins in the game, and says that to complete the picture, you need to envision pieces of ignorance flying around in there with the birds. But if this is the case, how would you be able to distinguish between the birds representing real knowledge and the ones representing false ones? Are there other birds that represent this type of knowledge? Socrates comes to the conclusion that this is absurd and therefore he discards the aviary analogy. After discarding the bird-cage analogy, Socrates and Theaetetus return to the definition of knowledge as &#x27;true judgement&#x27; . This, Theaetetus argues, is true because it is &#x27;free from mistakes.&#x27; However Socrates introduces an example of a jury in the law-courts, being persuaded of an opinion by a lawyer. This persuasion is not the same as knowing the truth, as all is produced is &#x27;conviction&#x27; in judging whatever the lawyers want. Although Theaetetus hopes it is possible the lawyer will be able to &#x27;persuade&#x27; the jury of the truth, Socrates is unsatisfied as if they are justly persuaded, they will have true knowledge. However, in Socrates&#x27; belief, they cannot make a correct judgement as they would not have true knowledge. With this conflict, Socrates decides that true judgement and knowledge must be different things. After distinguishing between knowledge and true judgement, Theaetetus recalls being told that true judgement &#x27;with an account (&quot;logos&quot;) equates to knowledge. Things without an account are &#x27;unknowable&#x27;, while things with an account are &#x27;knowable&#x27;.

Socrates responds by telling of a dream, in which he overheard people talking of primary elements. These primary elements can only be named, they cannot be thought of as existing or not - he gives examples of words like &#x27;itself, or that, each, alone or this.&#x27; While they can be added to other words, they by themselves are just a name. When these elements are added together, Socrates says that a &#x27;complex&#x27; is formed. The primary elements are &#x27;unaccountable and unknowable, but perceivable&#x27; while the complexes are &#x27;knowable and expressible&#x27; and so can be objects of &#x27;true judgement&#x27;. He concludes his dream by agreeing with Theaetetus that knowledge is &#x27;true judgement with an account.&#x27; However, Socrates exposes some difficulties by examining letters. He takes the first two letters of his name, S and O to wonder if the syllable &#x27;So&#x27; is knowable while the individual letters are not. Theaetetus finds the idea strange, so Socrates deduces that in order to know the syllable, the letters must be known first. Socrates proposes that the syllable can be a &#x27;single form&#x27; produced from the letters. With this in mind, Socrates considers whether the &#x27;sum&#x27; and the &#x27;whole&#x27; are the same. Theaetetus initially says they are not, but changes his mind in confusion when Socrates leads him through maths and the different ways of expressing the number six. After agreeing this, Socrates returns to the subject of syllables and letters to conclude from Theaetetus&#x27; answers that syllables are different from letters and cannot contain letters. Theaetetus admits this idea is ridiculous. Socrates returns to talking about elements and complexes to propose that they are in the same class, as they have &#x27;no parts and [are] a single form.&#x27; Socrates sums up this reversal by remarking that if anyone tries to tell them the complex is knowable and expressable while the element is the opposite, &#x27;we had better not listen to him&#x27;. He cites the example of a musician distinguishing individual notes (conceded to be elements of music) to propose that elements are &#x27;much more clearly known.&#x27; Socrates proposes an account to be &#x27;making one&#x27;s thought apparent vocally by means of words and verbal expressions.&#x27; However, he wonders if that is so, everyone will be able to make judgement &#x27;with an account&#x27; as they can all (except for the deaf and dumb) vocalize and express opinions on matters. Socrates examines it further by suggesting that a man who can vocalize his judgement must be able to make reference to the primary elements of the subject. Giving an example of defining a wagon by its individual parts, agreement is reached that an account is &#x27;going through a thing element by element.&#x27; Socrates questions Theaetetus by drawing on his learning of how to write, and the idea that if you misplace individual elements (letters) of a name, that does not mean you have knowledge of it. This finishes Socrates&#x27; second definition of an account as &#x27;the way to the whole through the elements&#x27; . 

The third definition Socrates offers is &#x27;being able to tell some mark by which the object you are asked about differs from all other things&#x27; , giving the example that the Sun is distinct for its brightness. However, this definition of an account fails as by getting to know the differentness of an object, you have to acquire knowledge about it. Thus the answer to the initial question &#x27;What is knowledge&#x27; would be heavily circuitous - correct judgement accompanied by &#x27;knowledge&#x27; of the differentness, which Socrates admits is &#x27;silly&#x27; . 

Socrates concludes the dialogue by announcing that all the two have produced are mere &quot;wind-eggs&quot; and that he must be getting on now to the courthouse to face his trial being brought against him by Meletus.

== Significant references in the dialogue ==
In this dialogue, Socrates refers to Epicharmus of Kos as &quot;the prince of Comedy&quot; and Homer as &quot;the prince of Tragedy&quot;, and both as &quot;great masters of either kind of poetry&quot;. This is significant because it is one of the very few extant references in greater antiquity (Fourth century BCE) to Epicharmus and his work. Another reference is in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Gorgias&quot; dialogue.

The dialogue references the Trial of Socrates, which takes place in 399 BCE and which the main dialogue immediately precedes. At the end of the dialogue, as Socrates is leaving to face a hearing at the Porch of the King Archon, he agrees to meet Theaetetus and Theodorus in the same place the following day, a conversation that is recounted in the &quot;Sophist&quot; and &quot;Statesman&quot; dialogues. The dialogue &quot;Euthyphro&quot; also is set on the same day, and would have occurred immediately after the Theaetetus, as it occurs outside the Porch of the King Archon as Socrates awaits his hearing.

The dialogue includes the earliest reference to The Astrologer who Fell into a Well, one of Aesop&#x27;s fables, in which the pre-Socratic philosopher Thales, who is known for his work in astronomy and his successful prediction of a solar eclipse, is so distracted by the stars that he forgets the ground below him, and proceeds to trip over a well.

== Legacy ==

=== Later Platonism ===
The Theaetetus was a popular dialogue in classical antiquity. Writing in the 1st century BCE, the Middle Platonist Eudorus of Alexandria references the definition of a philosopher as a &quot;likeness to a god&quot; and uses it to justify his synthesis of Platonism with Pythagorean teachings on virtue. One of Eudorus&#x27;s contemporaries, Philo of Alexandria also quoted from it frequently, implying that he considered it an important work. The Theaetetus was also the subject of many philosophical commentaries. The earliest surviving Platonic commentary, dating from between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE, is a commentary on the Theaetetus, which goes into detail on the nature of knowledge outlined in the work and compares it to the definitions of knowledge outlined in the Meno. The Theaetetus is also referenced frequently by Alcinous in his &quot;Handbook of Platonism&quot;.

In Late antiquity, the work was included in the Neoplatonic curriculum of twelve dialogues developed by Iamblichus, where it was preceded by the Cratylus, and considered a theoretical work on logic.

=== Gettier problems ===
In the 20th century, the dialogue and its definition of knowledge as a &quot;Justified True Belief&quot; were investigated by Edmund Gettier, who investigated Platonic epistemology as related in the Theaetetus and the &quot;Meno&quot; is his work &quot;Is Justified True Belief Knowledge (1963)&quot; where he develops the Gettier problem, an example of the type of scenario which challenges the notion that a justified true belief is the same thing as knowledge.

===Wittgenstein===
In the later years of his philosophy Wittgenstein took an interest in the Theaetetus. He sent a copy of it to his friend Maurice O&#x27;Connor Drury and told him that &quot;Plato in this dialogue is occupied with the same problems that I am writing about&quot;. He later quoted the text in Philosophical Investigations. Although he found that the text was preoccupied with the same problems he was dealing with, he critiqued what he considered the false pretence of discussion, telling O.K. Bouwsma that &quot;The young man Theaetetus is introduced as a promising, bright youngster, but he shows none of this. He has no fight in him at all. Why doesn&#x27;t he make a stand? Socrates arguing with these weaklings!&quot;

<text>Q fever or query fever is a disease caused by infection with &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot;, a bacterium that affects humans and other animals. This organism is uncommon, but may be found in cattle, sheep, goats, and other domestic mammals, including cats and dogs. The infection results from inhalation of a spore-like small-cell variant, and from contact with the milk, urine, feces, vaginal mucus, or semen of infected animals. Rarely, the disease is tick-borne. The incubation period can range from . Humans are vulnerable to Q fever, and infection can result from even a few organisms. The bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogenic parasite.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The incubation period is usually two to three weeks. The most common manifestation is flu-like symptoms: abrupt onset of fever, malaise, profuse perspiration, severe headache, muscle pain, joint pain, loss of appetite, upper respiratory problems, dry cough, pleuritic pain, chills, confusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. About half of infected individuals exhibit no symptoms.

During its course, the disease can progress to an atypical pneumonia, which can result in a life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome, usually occurring during the first four to five days of infection.

Less often, Q fever causes (granulomatous) hepatitis, which may be asymptomatic or become symptomatic with malaise, fever, liver enlargement, and pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. This hepatitis often results in the elevation of transaminase values, although jaundice is uncommon. Q fever can also rarely result in retinal vasculitis.

The chronic form of Q fever is virtually identical to endocarditis (i.e. inflammation of the inner lining of the heart), which can occur months or decades following the infection. It is usually fatal if untreated. However, with appropriate treatment, the mortality falls to around 10%.

A minority of Q fever survivors develop Q fever fatigue syndrome after acute infection, one of the more well-studied post-acute infection syndromes. Q fever fatigue syndrome is characterised by post-exertional malaise and debilitating fatigue. People with Q fever fatigue syndrome frequently meet the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Symptoms often persist years after the initial infection.

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis is usually based on serology (looking for an antibody response) rather than looking for the organism itself. Serology allows the detection of chronic infection by the appearance of high levels of the antibody against the virulent form of the bacterium. Molecular detection of bacterial DNA is increasingly used. Contrary to most obligate intracellular parasites, &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot; can be grown in an axenic culture, but its culture is technically difficult and not routinely available in most microbiology laboratories.

Q fever can cause endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) which may require transoesophageal echocardiography to diagnose. Q fever hepatitis manifests as an elevation of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, but a definitive diagnosis is only possible on liver biopsy, which shows the characteristic fibrin ring granulomas.

== Prevention ==
Research done in the 1960s1970s by French Canadian-American microbiologist and virologist Paul Fiset was instrumental in the development of the first successful Q fever vaccine.

Protection is offered by Q-Vax, a whole-cell, inactivated vaccine developed by an Australian vaccine manufacturing company, CSL Limited. The intradermal vaccination is composed of killed &quot;C. burnetii&quot; organisms. Skin and blood tests should be done before vaccination to identify pre-existing immunity because vaccinating people who already have immunity can result in a severe local reaction. After a single dose of vaccine, protective immunity lasts for many years. Revaccination is not generally required. Annual screening is typically recommended.

In 2001, Australia introduced a national Q fever vaccination program for people working in &quot;at-risk&quot; occupations. Vaccinated or previously exposed people may have their status recorded on the Australian Q Fever Register, which may be a condition of employment in the meat processing industry or in veterinary research. An earlier killed vaccine had been developed in the Soviet Union, but its side effects prevented its licensing abroad.

Preliminary results suggest vaccination of animals may be a method of control. Published trials proved that use of a registered phase vaccine (Coxevac) on infected farms is a tool of major interest to manage or prevent early or late abortion, repeat breeding, anoestrus, silent oestrus, metritis, and decreases in milk yield when &quot;C. burnetii&quot; is the major cause of these problems.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of acute Q fever with antibiotics is very effective. Commonly used antibiotics include doxycycline, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin; the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine is also used. Chronic Q fever is more difficult to treat and can require up to four years of treatment with doxycycline and quinolones or doxycycline with hydroxychloroquine. If a person has chronic Q fever, doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine will be prescribed for at least 18 months. Q fever in pregnancy is especially difficult to treat because doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are contraindicated in pregnancy. The preferred treatment for pregnancy and children under the age of eight is co-trimoxazole.

==Epidemiology==
Q fever is a globally distributed zoonotic disease caused by a highly sustainable and virulent bacterium. The pathogenic agent is found worldwide, with the exception of New Zealand and Antarctica. Understanding the transmission and risk factors of Q fever is crucial for public health due to its potential to cause widespread infection.

===Transmission and occupational risks===
Transmission primarily occurs through the inhalation of contaminated dust, contact with contaminated milk, meat, or wool, and particularly birthing products. Ticks can transfer the pathogenic agent to other animals. While human-to-human transmission is rare, often associated with the transmission of birth products, sexual contact, and blood transfusion, certain occupations pose higher risks for Q fever:

* Veterinary personnel
* Stockyard workers
* Farmers
* Sheep shearers
* Animal transporters
* Laboratory workers handling potentially infected veterinary samples or visiting abattoirs
* People who cull and process kangaroos
* Hide (tannery) workers

It is important to note that anyone who has contact with animals infected with Q fever bacteria, especially people who work on farms or with animals, is at an increased risk of contracting the disease. Understanding these occupational risks is crucial for public health.

===Prevalence and risk factors===
Studies indicate a higher prevalence of Q fever in men than in women, potentially linked to occupational exposure rates. Other contributing risk factors include geography, age, and occupational exposure. Diagnosis relies on blood compatibility testing, with treatment varying for acute and chronic cases. Acute disease often responds to doxycycline, while chronic cases may require a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine. It is worth noting that Q fever was officially reported in the United States as a notifiable disease in 1999 due to its potential biowarfare agent status.

Q fever exhibits global epidemiological patterns, with higher incidence rates reported in certain countries. In Africa, wild animals in rainforests primarily transmit the disease, making it endemic. Unique patterns are observed in Latin America, but reporting is sporadic and inconsistent between and among countries, making it difficult to track and address.

Recent outbreaks in European countries, including the Netherlands and France, have been linked to urbanized goat farming, raising concerns about the safety of intensive livestock farming practices and the potential risks of zoonotic diseases. Similarly, in the United States, Q fever is more common in livestock farming regions, especially in the West and the Great Plains. California, Texas, and Iowa account for almost 40% of reported cases, with a higher incidence during the spring and early summer when livestock are breeding, regardless of whether the infection is acute or chronic.

These outbreaks have affected a significant number of people, with immunocompromised individuals being more severely impacted. The global nature of Q fever and its association with livestock farming highlight the importance of implementing measures to prevent and control the spread of the disease, particularly in high-risk regions.

===Age and occupational exposure===
Older men in the West and Great Plains regions, involved in close contact with livestock management, are at a higher risk of contracting chronic Q fever. This risk may be further increased for those with a history of cardiac problems. The disease can manifest years after the initial infection, presenting symptoms such as non-specific fatigue, fever, weight loss, and endocarditis. Additionally, certain populations are more vulnerable to Q fever, including children living in farming communities, who may experience similar symptoms as adults. There have also been reported cases of Q fever among United States military service members, particularly those deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, which further highlights the importance of understanding and addressing the occupational risks associated with Q fever.

===Prevention and public health education===
Proper public health education is crucial in reducing the number of Q fever cases. Raising awareness about transmission routes, occupational risks, and preventive measures, such as eliminating unpasteurized milk products from the diet, can help prevent the spread of disease.

Interdisciplinary collaboration between medical personnel and farmers is critical when developing strategies for control and prevention in a community. Awareness campaigns should particularly target occupations that work with livestock, focusing on risk-reduction procedures such as herd monitoring, implementing sanitation practices and personal protective equipment, and vaccinating animals. Locating livestock farms at least 500 meters away from residential areas can also help reduce animal-to-human transmission.

== History ==

Q fever was first described in 1935 by Edward Holbrook Derrick in slaughterhouse workers in Brisbane, Queensland. The &quot;Q&quot; stands for &quot;query&quot; and was applied at a time when the causative agent was unknown; it was chosen over suggestions of abattoir fever and Queensland rickettsial fever, to avoid directing negative connotations at either the cattle industry or the state of Queensland.

The pathogen of Q fever was discovered in 1937, when Frank Macfarlane Burnet and Mavis Freeman isolated the bacterium from one of Derrick&#x27;s patients. It was originally identified as a species of &quot;Rickettsia&quot;. H.R. Cox and Gordon Davis elucidated the transmission when they isolated it from ticks found in the US state of Montana in 1938. It is a zoonotic disease whose most common animal reservoirs are cattle, sheep, and goats. &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot; – named for Cox and Burnet – is no longer regarded as closely related to the Rickettsiae, but as similar to &quot;Legionella&quot; and &quot;Francisella&quot;, and is a Gammaproteobacterium.

== Society and culture ==
An early mention of Q fever was important in one of the early Dr. Kildare films (1939, &quot;Calling Dr. Kildare&quot;). Kildare&#x27;s mentor Dr. Gillespie (Lionel Barrymore) tires of his protégé working fruitlessly on &quot;exotic diagnoses&quot; (&quot;I think it&#x27;s Q fever!&quot;) and sends him to work in a neighborhood clinic, instead.

=== Biological warfare ===
&quot;C. burnetii&quot; has been used to develop biological weapons.

The United States investigated it as a potential biological warfare agent in the 1950s, with eventual standardization as agent OU. At Fort Detrick and Dugway Proving Ground, human trials were conducted on Whitecoat volunteers to determine the median infective dose (18 MICLD50/person i.h.) and course of infection. The Deseret Test Center dispensed biological Agent OU with ships and aircraft, during Project 112 and Project SHAD. As a standardized biological, it was manufactured in large quantities at Pine Bluff Arsenal, with 5,098 gallons in the arsenal in bulk at the time of demilitarization in 1970.

&quot;C. burnetii&quot; is currently ranked as a &quot;category B&quot; bioterrorism agent by the CDC. It can be contagious and is very stable in aerosols in a wide range of temperatures. Q fever microorganisms may survive on surfaces for up to 60 days. It is considered a good agent in part because its ID50 (number of bacilli needed to infect 50% of individuals) is considered to be one, making it the lowest known.

==In animals==
Q fever can affect many species of domestic and wild animals, including ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, bison, deer species...), carnivores (dogs, cats, seals...), rodents, reptiles and birds. However, ruminants (cattle, goats, and sheep) are the most frequently affected animals, and can serve as a reservoir for the bacteria.

=== Clinical signs ===
In contrast to humans, though a respiratory and cardiac infection could be experimentally reproduced in cattle, the clinical signs mainly affect the reproductive system. Q fever in ruminants is, therefore, mainly responsible for abortions, metritis, retained placenta, and infertility.

The clinical signs vary between species. In small ruminants (sheep and goats), it is dominated by abortions, premature births, stillbirths, and the birth of weak lambs or kids. One of the characteristics of abortions in goats is that they are very frequent and clustered in the first year or two after contamination of the farm. This is known as an abortion storm.

In cattle, although abortions also occur, they are less frequent and more sporadic. The clinical picture is rather dominated by nonspecific signs such as placental retentions, metritis, and consequent fertility disorders.

=== Epidemiology ===
With the exception of New Zealand, which is currently free of Q fever, the disease is present throughout the world. Numerous epidemiological surveys have been carried out. They have shown that about one in three cattle farms and one in four sheep or goat farms are infected, but wide variations are seen between studies and countries. In China, Iran, Great Britain, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Spain, the US, Belgium, Denmark, Croatia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Serbia, Slovenia, and Jordan, for example, more than 50% of cattle herds were infected with Q fever.

Infected animals shed the bacteria by three routes - genital discharge, faeces, and milk. Excretion is greatest at the time of parturition or abortion, and placentas and aborted fetuses are the main sources of bacteria, particularly in goats.

As &quot;C. burnetii&quot; is small and resistant in the environment, it is easily airborne and can be transmitted from one farm to another, even if several kilometres away.

=== Control ===

==== Biosecurity measures ====
Based on the epidemiological data, biosecurity measures can be derived:
* The spread of manure from infected farms should be avoided in windy conditions
* The level of hygiene must be very high during parturition and fetal annexes, and fetuses must be collected and destroyed as soon as possible

==== Medical measures ====
A vaccine for cattle, goats, and sheep exists. It reduces clinical expression such as abortions and decreases excretion of the bacteria by the animals leading to control of Q fever in herds.

In addition, vaccination of herds against Q fever has been shown to reduce the risk of human infection.

<text>Tay–Sachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The most common form is infantile Tay–Sachs disease, which becomes apparent around the age of three to six months of age, with the infant losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl. This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five. Less commonly, the disease may occur later in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset). These forms tend to be less severe, but the juvenile form typically results in death by age 15.
Tay–Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the &quot;HEXA&quot; gene on chromosome 15, which codes a subunit of the hexosaminidase enzyme known as hexosaminidase A. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The mutation disrupts the activity of the enzyme, which results in the build-up of the molecule GM2 ganglioside within cells, leading to toxicity. Diagnosis may be supported by measuring the blood hexosaminidase A level or genetic testing. Tay–Sachs disease is a type of GM2 gangliosidosis and sphingolipidosis.
The treatment of Tay–Sachs disease is supportive in nature. This may involve multiple specialties as well as psychosocial support for the family. The disease is rare in the general population. In Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians of southeastern Quebec, the Old Order Amish of Pennsylvania, and the Cajuns of southern Louisiana, the condition is more common. Approximately 1 in 3,600 Ashkenazi Jews at birth are affected.
The disease is named after British ophthalmologist Waren Tay, who in 1881 first described a symptomatic red spot on the retina of the eye; and American neurologist Bernard Sachs, who described in 1887 the cellular changes and noted an increased rate of disease in Ashkenazi Jews. Carriers of a single Tay–Sachs allele are typically normal. It has been hypothesized that being a carrier may confer protection from tuberculosis, explaining the persistence of the allele in certain populations. Researchers are looking at gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy as possible treatments.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Tay–Sachs disease is typically first noticed in infants around 6 months old displaying an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimuli, known as the &quot;startle response&quot;. There may also be listlessness or muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are differentiated based on the onset age of neurological symptoms.

=== Infantile ===
Infants with Tay–Sachs disease appear to develop normally for the first six months after birth. Then, as neurons become distended with GM2 gangliosides, a relentless deterioration of mental and physical abilities begins. The child may become blind, deaf, unable to swallow, atrophied, and paralytic. Death usually occurs before the age of four.

=== Juvenile ===
Juvenile Tay–Sachs disease is rarer than other forms of Tay–Sachs and usually is initially seen in children between two and ten years old. People with Tay–Sachs disease experience cognitive and motor skill deterioration, dysarthria, dysphagia, ataxia, and spasticity. Death usually occurs between the ages of five and fifteen years.

=== Late-onset ===
A rare form of this disease, known as Adult-Onset or Late-Onset Tay–Sachs disease, usually has its first symptoms during the 30s or 40s. In contrast to the other forms, late-onset Tay–Sachs disease is usually not fatal as the effects can stop progressing. It is frequently misdiagnosed. It is characterized by unsteadiness of gait and progressive neurological deterioration. Symptoms of late-onset Tay–Sachs – which typically begin to be seen in adolescence or early adulthood – include speech and swallowing difficulties, unsteadiness of gait, spasticity, cognitive decline, and psychiatric illness, particularly a schizophrenia-like psychosis. Late-onset Tay–Sachs patients may become fully wheelchair-bound.

Until the 1970s and 1980s, when the disease&#x27;s molecular genetics became known, the juvenile and adult forms of the disease were not always recognized as variants of Tay–Sachs disease. Post-infantile Tay–Sachs was often misdiagnosed as another neurological disorder, such as Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia.

==Genetics==
Tay–Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, meaning that when both parents are carriers, there is a 25% risk of giving birth to an affected child with each pregnancy. The affected child would have received a mutated copy of the gene from each parent. A person with one mutated copy and one normal copy is a carrier, like the parent they received the mutant copy from. Tay–Sachs carriers are known to be more resistant to infections of mycobacteria, including tuberculosis, compared to a person with two normal copies of the gene.

Tay–Sachs results from mutations in the &quot;HEXA&quot; gene on chromosome 15, which encodes the alpha-subunit of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A, a lysosomal enzyme. By 2000, more than 100 different mutations had been identified in the human &quot;HEXA&quot; gene. These mutations have included single base insertions and deletions, splice phase mutations, missense mutations, and other more complex patterns. Each of these mutations alters the gene&#x27;s protein product (i.e., the enzyme), sometimes severely inhibiting its function. In recent years, population studies and pedigree analysis have shown how such mutations arise and spread within small founder populations. Initial research focused on several such founder populations:
* Ashkenazi Jews. A four base pair insertion in exon 11 (1278insTATC) results in an altered reading frame for the &quot;HEXA&quot; gene. This mutation is the most prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and leads to the infantile form of Tay–Sachs disease.
* Cajuns. The same 1278insTATC mutation found among Ashkenazi Jews occurs in the Cajun population of southern Louisiana. Researchers have traced the ancestry of carriers from Louisiana families back to a single founder couple – not known to be Jewish – who lived in France in the 18th century.
* French Canadians. Two mutations, unrelated to the Ashkenazi/Cajun mutation, are absent in France but common among certain French-Canadian communities living in southeastern Quebec and Acadians from the Province of New Brunswick. Pedigree analysis suggests that mutations were uncommon before the late 17th century.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, when the biochemical basis of Tay–Sachs disease was first becoming known, no mutations had been sequenced directly for genetic diseases. Researchers of that era did not yet know how common polymorphisms would prove to be. The &quot;Jewish Fur Trader Hypothesis&quot;, with its implication that a single mutation must have spread from one population into another, reflected the knowledge at the time. Subsequent research, however, has proven that a large variety of different &quot;HEXA&quot; mutations can cause the disease. Because Tay–Sachs was one of the first genetic disorders for which widespread genetic screening was possible, it is one of the first genetic disorders in which the prevalence of compound heterozygosity has been demonstrated.

Compound heterozygosity ultimately explains the disease&#x27;s variability, including the late-onset forms. The disease can potentially result from the inheritance of two unrelated mutations in the &quot;HEXA&quot; gene, one from each parent. Classic infantile Tay–Sachs disease results when a child has inherited mutations from both parents that completely stop the biodegradation of gangliosides. Late-onset forms occur due to the diverse mutation base – people with Tay–Sachs disease may technically be heterozygotes, with two differing &quot;HEXA&quot; mutations that both inactivate, alter, or inhibit enzyme activity. When a patient has at least one &quot;HEXA&quot; copy that still enables some hexosaminidase A activity, a later onset disease form occurs. When disease occurs because of two unrelated mutations, the patient is said to be a compound heterozygote.

Heterozygous carriers (individuals who inherit one mutant allele) show abnormal enzyme activity but manifest no disease symptoms. This phenomenon is called dominance; the biochemical reason for wild-type alleles&#x27; dominance over nonfunctional mutant alleles in inborn errors of metabolism comes from how enzymes function. Enzymes are protein catalysts for chemical reactions; as catalysts, they speed up reactions without being used up in the process, so only small enzyme quantities are required to carry out a reaction. Someone homozygous for a nonfunctional mutation in the enzyme-encoding gene has little or no enzyme activity, so will manifest the abnormal phenotype (i.e. will develop full-blown disease). A normal: mutated heterozygote (heterozygous individual, also known as a &#x27;carrier&#x27;) has at least half of the normal enzyme activity level, due to the expression of the wild-type allele. This level is normally enough to enable normal functioning and thus prevent phenotypic expression (i.e. a normal: mutated carrier will not become ill).

==Pathophysiology==
Tay–Sachs disease is caused by insufficient activity of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. Hexosaminidase A is a vital hydrolytic enzyme, found in the lysosomes, that breaks down sphingolipids. When hexosaminidase A is no longer functioning properly, the lipids accumulate in the brain and interfere with normal biological processes. Hexosaminidase A specifically breaks down fatty acid derivatives called gangliosides; these are made and biodegraded rapidly in early life as the brain develops. Patients with and carriers of Tay–Sachs can be identified by a simple blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity.

The hydrolysis of GM2-ganglioside requires three proteins. Two of them are subunits of hexosaminidase A; the third is a small glycolipid transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which acts as a substrate-specific cofactor for the enzyme. Deficiency in any one of these proteins leads to ganglioside storage, primarily in the lysosomes of neurons. Tay–Sachs disease (along with AB-variant GM2-gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) occurs because a mutation inherited from both parents deactivates or inhibits this process. Most Tay–Sachs mutations probably do not directly affect protein functional elements (e.g., the active site). Instead, they cause incorrect folding (disrupting function) or disable intracellular transport.

==Diagnosis==
In patients with a clinical suspicion of Tay–Sachs disease, with any age of onset, the initial testing involves an enzyme assay to measure the activity of hexosaminidase in serum, fibroblasts, or leukocytes. Total hexosaminidase enzyme activity is decreased in individuals with Tay–Sachs as is the percentage of hexosaminidase A. After confirmation of decreased enzyme activity in an individual, confirmation by molecular analysis can be pursued. All patients with infantile-onset Tay–Sachs disease have a &quot;cherry red&quot; macula in the retina, easily observable by a physician using an ophthalmoscope. This red spot is a retinal area that appears red because of gangliosides in the surrounding retinal ganglion cells. The choroidal circulation is showing through &quot;red&quot; in this foveal region where all retinal ganglion cells are pushed aside to increase visual acuity. Thus, this cherry-red spot is the only normal part of the retina; it shows up in contrast to the rest of the retina. Microscopic analysis of the retinal neurons shows they are distended from excess ganglioside storage. Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher disease, Niemann–Pick disease, and Sandhoff disease), hepatosplenomegaly (liver and spleen enlargement) is not seen in Tay–Sachs.

==Prevention==

Three main approaches have been used to prevent or reduce the incidence of Tay–Sachs:
* Prenatal diagnosis. If both parents are identified as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), the most common form of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.
* Preimplantation genetic diagnosis. By retrieving the mother&#x27;s eggs for in vitro fertilization, it is possible to test the embryo for the disorder before implantation. Healthy embryos are then selected and transferred into the mother&#x27;s womb, while unhealthy embryos are discarded. In addition to Tay–Sachs disease, preimplantation genetic diagnosis has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia among other genetic disorders.
* Pre-marriage screening. In Orthodox Jewish circles, the organization Dor Yeshorim carries out an anonymous screening program so that carriers for Tay–Sachs and other genetic disorders can avoid marrying each other.

==Management==
As of 2010, no treatment addressed the cause of Tay–Sachs disease or could slow its progression; people receive supportive care to ease the symptoms and extend life by reducing the chance of contracting infections. Infants are given feeding tubes when they can no longer swallow. In late-onset Tay–Sachs, medication (e.g., lithium for depression) can sometimes control psychiatric symptoms and seizures, although some medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, haloperidol, and risperidone) are associated with significant adverse effects.

==Outcomes==
As of 2010, even with the best care, children with infantile Tay–Sachs disease usually die by the age of 4. Children with the juvenile form are likely to die between the ages of 5–15, while the lifespans of those with the adult form will probably not be affected.

==Epidemiology==
Ashkenazi Jews have a high incidence of Tay–Sachs and other lipid storage diseases. In the United States, about 1 in 27 to 1 in 30 Ashkenazi Jews is a recessive carrier. The disease incidence is about 1 in every 3,500 newborns among Ashkenazi Jews. French Canadians and the Cajun community of Louisiana have an occurrence similar to the Ashkenazi Jews. Irish Americans have a 1 in 50 chance of being a carrier. In the general population, the incidence of carriers as heterozygotes is about 1 in 300. The incidence is approximately 1 in 320,000 newborns in the general population in the United States.

Three general classes of theories have been proposed to explain the high frequency of Tay–Sachs carriers in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:
* Heterozygote advantage. When applied to a particular allele, this theory posits that mutation carriers have a selective advantage, perhaps in a particular environment.
* Reproductive compensation. Parents who lose a child because of disease tend to &quot;compensate&quot; by having additional children following the loss. This phenomenon may maintain and possibly even increase the incidence of autosomal recessive disease.
* Founder effect. This hypothesis states that the high incidence of the 1278insTATC chromosomes is the result of an elevated allele frequency that existed by chance in an early founder population.

Tay–Sachs disease was one of the first genetic disorders for which epidemiology was studied using molecular data. Studies of Tay–Sachs mutations using new molecular techniques such as linkage disequilibrium and coalescence analysis have brought an emerging consensus among researchers supporting the founder effect theory.

==History==

Waren Tay and Bernard Sachs were two physicians. They described the disease&#x27;s progression and provided differential diagnostic criteria to distinguish it from other neurological disorders with similar symptoms.

Both Tay and Sachs reported their first cases among Ashkenazi Jewish families. Tay reported his observations in 1881 in the first volume of the proceedings of the British Ophthalmological Society, of which he was a founding member. By 1884, he had seen three cases in a single family. Years later, Bernard Sachs, an American neurologist, reported similar findings when he reported a case of &quot;arrested cerebral development&quot; to other New York Neurological Society members.

Sachs, who recognized that the disease had a familial basis, proposed that the disease should be called &quot;amaurotic familial idiocy&quot;. However, its genetic basis was still poorly understood. Although Gregor Mendel had published his article on the genetics of peas in 1865, Mendel&#x27;s paper was largely forgotten for more than a generation – not rediscovered by other scientists until 1899. Thus, the Mendelian model for explaining Tay–Sachs was unavailable to scientists and doctors of the time. The first edition of the Jewish Encyclopedia, published in 12 volumes between 1901 and 1906, described what was then known about the disease:
It is a curious fact that amaurotic family idiocy, a rare and fatal disease of children, occurs mostly among Jews. The largest number of cases has been observed in the United States—over thirty in number. It was at first thought that this was an exclusively Jewish disease because most of the cases at first reported were between Russian and Polish Jews, but recently there have been reported cases occurring in non-Jewish children. The chief characteristics of the disease are progressive mental and physical enfeeblement; weakness and paralysis of all the extremities; and marasmus, associated with symmetrical changes in the macula lutea. On investigation of the reported cases, they found that neither consanguinity nor syphilitic, alcoholic, or nervous antecedents in the family history are factors in the etiology of the disease. No preventive measures have as yet been discovered, and no treatment has been of benefit, all the cases having terminated fatally.
Jewish immigration to the United States peaked in the period 1880–1924, with the immigrants arriving from Russia and countries in Eastern Europe; this was also a period of nativism (hostility to immigrants) in the United States. Opponents of immigration often questioned whether immigrants from southern and eastern Europe could be assimilated into American society. Reports of Tay–Sachs disease contributed to a perception among nativists that Jews were an inferior race.

In 1969, Shintaro Okada and John S. O&#x27;Brien showed that Tay–Sachs disease was caused by an enzyme defect; they also proved that Tay–Sachs patients could be diagnosed by an assay of hexosaminidase A activity. The further development of enzyme assays demonstrated that levels of hexosaminidases A and B could be measured in patients and carriers, allowing the reliable detection of heterozygotes. During the early 1970s, researchers developed protocols for newborn testing, carrier screening, and prenatal diagnosis. By the end of 1979, researchers had identified three variant forms of GM2 gangliosidosis, including Sandhoff disease and the AB variant of GM2-gangliosidosis, accounting for false negatives in carrier testing.

==Society and culture==

Since carrier testing for Tay–Sachs began in 1971, millions of Ashkenazi Jews have been screened as carriers. Jewish communities embraced the cause of genetic screening from the 1970s on. The success with Tay–Sachs disease has led Israel to become the first country that offers free genetic screening and counseling for all couples and opened discussions about the proper scope of genetic testing for other disorders in Israel.

Because Tay–Sachs disease was one of the first autosomal recessive genetic disorders for which there was an enzyme assay test (before polymerase chain reaction testing methods), it was intensely studied as a model for all such diseases, and researchers sought evidence of a selective process. A continuing controversy is whether heterozygotes (carriers) have or had a selective advantage. The presence of four different lysosomal storage disorders in the Ashkenazi Jewish population suggests a past selective advantage for heterozygous carriers of these conditions.&quot;

This controversy among researchers has reflected various debates among geneticists at large:
* Dominance versus overdominance. In applied genetics (selective and agricultural breeding), this controversy has reflected the century-long debate over whether dominance or overdominance provides the best explanation for heterosis (hybrid vigor).
* The classical/balance controversy. The classical hypothesis of genetic variability, often associated with Hermann Muller, maintains that most genes are of a normal wild type and that most individuals are homozygous for that wild type, while most selection is purifying selection that operates to eliminate deleterious alleles. The balancing hypothesis, often associated with Theodosius Dobzhansky, states that heterozygosity will be common at loci and that it frequently reflects either directional selection or balancing selection.
* Selectionists versus neutralists. In theoretical population genetics, selectionists emphasize the primacy of natural selection as a determinant of evolution and variation within a population, while neutralists favor a form of Motoo Kimura&#x27;s neutral theory of molecular evolution, which emphasizes the role of genetic drift.

==Research directions==

===Enzyme replacement therapy===
Enzyme replacement therapy techniques have been investigated for lysosomal storage disorders, and could potentially be used to treat Tay–Sachs as well. The goal would be to replace the nonfunctional enzyme, a process similar to insulin injections for diabetes. However, in previous studies, the &quot;HEXA&quot; enzyme itself has been thought to be too large to pass through the specialized cell layer in the blood vessels that form the blood–brain barrier in humans.

Researchers have also tried directly instilling the deficient enzyme hexosaminidase A into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which bathes the brain. However, intracerebral neurons seem unable to take up this physically large molecule efficiently even when it is directly by them. Therefore, this approach to treatment of Tay–Sachs disease has also been ineffective so far.

===Jacob sheep model===
Tay–Sachs disease exists in Jacob sheep. The biochemical mechanism for this disease in the Jacob sheep is virtually identical to that in humans, wherein diminished activity of hexosaminidase A results in increased concentrations of GM2 ganglioside in the affected animal. Sequencing of the &quot;HEXA&quot; gene cDNA of affected Jacobs sheep reveal an identical number of nucleotides and exons as in the human &quot;HEXA&quot; gene, and 86% nucleotide sequence identity. A missense mutation (G444R) was found in the &quot;HEXA&quot; cDNA of the affected sheep. This mutation is a single nucleotide change at the end of exon 11, resulting in that exon&#x27;s deletion (before translation) via splicing. The Tay–Sachs model provided by the Jacob sheep is the first to offer promise as a means for gene therapy clinical trials, which may prove useful for disease treatment in humans.

===Substrate reduction therapy===
Other experimental methods being researched involve substrate reduction therapy, which attempts to use alternative enzymes to increase the brain&#x27;s catabolism of GM2 gangliosides to a point where residual degradative activity is sufficient to prevent substrate accumulation. One experiment has demonstrated that using the enzyme sialidase allows the genetic defect to be effectively bypassed, and as a consequence, GM2 gangliosides are metabolized so that their levels become almost inconsequential. If a safe pharmacological treatment can be developed – one that increases expression of lysosomal sialidase in neurons without other toxicity – then this new form of therapy could essentially cure the disease.

Another metabolic therapy under investigation for Tay–Sachs disease uses miglustat. This drug is a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyzes the first step in synthesizing glucose-based glycosphingolipids like GM2 ganglioside.

===Increasing β-hexosaminidase A activity===
As Tay–Sachs disease is a deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A, deterioration of affected individuals could be slowed or stopped through the use of a substance that increases its activity. However, since in infantile Tay–Sachs disease there is no β-hexosaminidase A, the treatment would be ineffective, but for people affected by Late-Onset Tay–Sachs disease, β-hexosaminidase A is present, so the treatment may be effective. The drug pyrimethamine has been shown to increase activity of β-hexosaminidase A. However, the increased levels of β-hexosaminidase A still fall far short of the desired &quot;10% of normal HEXA&quot;, above which the phenotypic symptoms begin to disappear.

=== Cord blood transplant ===
This is a highly invasive procedure that involves destroying the patient&#x27;s blood system with chemotherapy and administering cord blood. Of five people who had received the treatment as of 2008, two were still alive after five years and they still had a great deal of health problems.

Critics point to the procedure&#x27;s harsh nature—and the fact that it is unapproved. Other significant issues involve the difficulty in crossing the blood–brain barrier, as well as the great expense, as each unit of cord blood costs $25,000, and adult recipients need many units.

=== Gene therapy ===
On 10 February 2022, the first-ever gene therapy was announced, it uses an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver the correct instruction for the HEXA gene on brain cells which causes the disease. Only two children were part of a compassionate trial presenting improvements over the natural course of the disease and no vector-related adverse events.

<text>Tourette syndrome or Tourette&#x27;s syndrome (abbreviated as TS or Tourette&#x27;s) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in childhood or adolescence. It is characterized by multiple movement (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. Common tics are blinking, coughing, throat clearing, sniffing, and facial movements. These are typically preceded by an unwanted urge or sensation in the affected muscles known as a premonitory urge, can sometimes be suppressed temporarily, and characteristically change in location, strength, and frequency. Tourette&#x27;s is at the more severe end of a spectrum of tic disorders. The tics often go unnoticed by casual observers.

Tourette&#x27;s was once regarded as a rare and bizarre syndrome and has popularly been associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks). It is no longer considered rare; about 1% of school-age children and adolescents are estimated to have Tourette&#x27;s, though coprolalia occurs only in a minority. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette&#x27;s; it is not always correctly identified, because most cases are mild, and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence. Therefore, many go undiagnosed or may never seek medical attention. Extreme Tourette&#x27;s in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is rare, but for a small minority, severely debilitating tics can persist into adulthood. Tourette&#x27;s does not affect intelligence or life expectancy.

There is no cure for Tourette&#x27;s and no single most effective medication. In most cases, medication for tics is not necessary, and behavioral therapies are the first-line treatment. Education is an important part of any treatment plan, and explanation alone often provides sufficient reassurance that no other treatment is necessary. Other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), are more likely to be present among those who are referred to specialty clinics than they are among the broader population of persons with Tourette&#x27;s. These co-occurring conditions often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence it is important to correctly distinguish co-occurring conditions and treat them.

Tourette syndrome was named by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot for his intern, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who published in 1885 an account of nine patients with a &quot;convulsive tic disorder&quot;. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The mechanism appears to involve dysfunction in neural circuits between the basal ganglia and related structures in the brain.

== Classification ==
Most published research on Tourette syndrome originates in the United States; in international TS research and clinical practice, the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) is preferred over the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, which is criticized in the 2021 &quot;European Clinical Guidelines.

In the fifth version of the DSM (DSM-5), published in 2013, Tourette syndrome is classified as a motor disorder (a disorder of the nervous system that causes abnormal and involuntary movements). It is listed in the neurodevelopmental disorder category. Tourette&#x27;s is at the more severe end of the spectrum of tic disorders; its diagnosis requires multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic to be present for more than a year. Tics are sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic movements that involve discrete muscle groups, while vocal (phonic) tics involve laryngeal, pharyngeal, oral, nasal or respiratory muscles to produce sounds. The tics must not be explained by other medical conditions or substance use.

Other tic disorders include persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tics, in which one type of tic (motor or vocal, but not both) has been present for more than a year; and provisional tic disorder, in which motor or vocal tics have been present for less than one year. The fifth edition of the DSM replaced what had been called &quot;transient tic disorder&quot; with &quot;provisional tic disorder&quot;, recognizing that &quot;transient&quot; can only be defined in retrospect. Some experts believe that TS and persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder should be considered the same condition, because vocal tics are also motor tics in the sense that they are muscular contractions of nasal or respiratory muscles.

Tourette syndrome is defined only slightly differently by the WHO; in its ICD-11, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tourette syndrome is classified as a disease of the nervous system and a neurodevelopmental disorder, and only one motor tic and one or more vocal tics are required for diagnosis. Older versions of the ICD called it &quot;combined vocal and multiple motor tic disorder [de la Tourette]&quot;.

Genetic studies indicate that tic disorders cover a spectrum that is not recognized by the clear-cut distinctions in the current diagnostic framework. Since 2008, studies have suggested that Tourette&#x27;s is not a unitary condition with a distinct mechanism, as described in the existing classification systems. Instead, the studies suggest that subtypes should be recognized to distinguish &quot;pure TS&quot; from TS that is accompanied by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) or other disorders, similar to the way that subtypes have been established for other conditions, such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Elucidation of these subtypes awaits fuller understanding of the genetic and other causes of tic disorders.

== Characteristics ==
=== Tics ===

Tics are movements or sounds that take place &quot;intermittently and unpredictably out of a background of normal motor activity&quot;, having the appearance of &quot;normal behaviors gone wrong&quot;. The tics associated with Tourette&#x27;s ; they change in number, frequency, severity, anatomical location, and complexity; each person experiences a unique pattern of fluctuation in their severity and frequency. Tics may also occur in &quot;bouts of bouts&quot;, which also vary among people. The variation in tic severity may occur over hours, days, or weeks. Tics may increase when someone is experiencing stress, fatigue, anxiety, or illness, or when engaged in relaxing activities like watching TV. They sometimes decrease when an individual is engrossed in or focused on an activity like playing a musical instrument.

In contrast to the abnormal movements associated with other movement disorders, the tics of Tourette&#x27;s are nonrhythmic, often preceded by an unwanted urge, and temporarily suppressible. Over time, about 90% of individuals with Tourette&#x27;s feel an urge preceding the tic, similar to the urge to sneeze or scratch an itch. The urges and sensations that precede the expression of a tic are referred to as premonitory sensory phenomena or premonitory urges. People describe the urge to express the tic as a buildup of tension, pressure, or energy which they ultimately choose consciously to release, as if they &quot;had to do it&quot; to relieve the sensation or until it feels &quot;just right&quot;. The urge may cause a distressing sensation in the part of the body associated with the resulting tic; the tic is a response that relieves the urge in the anatomical location of the tic. Examples of this urge are the feeling of having something in one&#x27;s throat, leading to a tic to clear one&#x27;s throat, or a localized discomfort in the shoulders leading to shrugging the shoulders. The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation, similar to scratching an itch or blinking to relieve an uncomfortable feeling in the eye. Some people with Tourette&#x27;s may not be aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics. Children may be less aware of it than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity; by the age of ten, most children recognize the premonitory urge.

Premonitory urges which precede the tic make suppression of the impending tic possible. Because of the urges that precede them, tics are described as semi-voluntary or &quot;unvoluntary&quot;, rather than specifically &quot;involuntary&quot;; they may be experienced as a &quot;voluntary&quot;, suppressible response to the unwanted premonitory urge. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults than children. People with tics are sometimes able to suppress them for limited periods of time, but doing so often results in tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette&#x27;s may seek a secluded spot to release the suppressed urge, or there may be a marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or work. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor&#x27;s office, so they may need to be observed when not aware of being watched.

Complex tics related to speech include coprolalia, echolalia and palilalia. Coprolalia is the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases. Although it is the most publicized symptom of Tourette&#x27;s, only about 10% of people with Tourette&#x27;s exhibit it, and it is not required for a diagnosis. Echolalia (repeating the words of others) and palilalia (repeating one&#x27;s own words) occur in a minority of cases. Complex motor tics include copropraxia (obscene or forbidden gestures, or inappropriate touching), echopraxia (repetition or imitation of another person&#x27;s actions) and palipraxia (repeating one&#x27;s own movements).

=== Onset and progression ===
There is no typical case of Tourette syndrome, but the age of onset and the severity of symptoms follow a fairly reliable course. Although onset may occur anytime before eighteen years, the typical age of onset of tics is from five to seven, and is usually before adolescence. A 1998 study from the Yale Child Study Center showed that tic severity increased with age until it reached its highest point between ages eight and twelve. Severity declines steadily for most children as they pass through adolescence, when half to two-thirds of children see a dramatic decrease in tics.

In people with TS, the first tics to appear usually affect the head, face, and shoulders, and include blinking, facial movements, sniffing and throat clearing. Vocal tics often appear months or years after motor tics but can appear first. Among people who experience more severe tics, complex tics may develop, including &quot;arm straightening, touching, tapping, jumping, hopping and twirling&quot;. There are different movements in contrasting disorders (for example, the autism spectrum disorders), such as self-stimulation and stereotypies.

The severity of symptoms varies widely among people with Tourette&#x27;s, and many cases may be undetected. Most cases are mild and almost unnoticeable; many people with TS may not realize they have tics. Because tics are more commonly expressed in private, Tourette syndrome may go unrecognized, and casual observers might not notice tics. Most studies of TS involve males, who have a higher prevalence of TS than females, and gender-based differences are not well studied; a 2021 review suggested that the characteristics and progression for females, particularly in adulthood, may differ and better studies are needed.

Most adults with TS have mild symptoms and do not seek medical attention. While tics subside for the majority after adolescence, some of the &quot;most severe and debilitating forms of tic disorder are encountered&quot; in adults. In some cases, what appear to be adult-onset tics can be childhood tics re-surfacing.

=== Co-occurring conditions ===
Because people with milder symptoms are unlikely to be referred to specialty clinics, studies of Tourette&#x27;s have an inherent bias towards more severe cases. When symptoms are severe enough to warrant referral to clinics, ADHD and OCD are often also found. In specialty clinics, 30% of those with TS also have mood or anxiety disorders or disruptive behaviors. In the absence of ADHD, tic disorders do not appear to be associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in those who have more comorbid conditions. When ADHD is present along with tics, the occurrence of conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder increases. Aggressive behaviors and angry outbursts in people with TS are not well understood; they are not associated with severe tics, but are connected with the presence of ADHD. ADHD may also contribute to higher rates of anxiety, and aggression and anger control problems are more likely when both OCD and ADHD co-occur with Tourette&#x27;s.

Compulsions that resemble tics are present in some individuals with OCD; &quot;tic-related OCD&quot; is hypothesized to be a subgroup of OCD, distinguished from non-tic related OCD by the type and nature of obsessions and compulsions. Compared to the more typical compulsions of OCD without tics that relate to contamination, tic-related OCD presents with more &quot;counting, aggressive thoughts, symmetry and touching&quot; compulsions. Compulsions associated with OCD without tics are usually related to obsessions and anxiety, while those in tic-related OCD are more likely to be a response to a premonitory urge. There are increased rates of anxiety and depression in those adults with TS who also have OCD.

Among individuals with TS studied in clinics, between 2.9% and 20% had autism spectrum disorders, but one study indicates that a high association of autism and TS may be partly due to difficulties distinguishing between tics and tic-like behaviors or OCD symptoms seen in autistic people.

Not all people with Tourette&#x27;s have ADHD or OCD or other comorbid conditions, and estimates of the rate of pure TS or TS-only vary from 15% to 57%; in clinical populations, a high percentage of those under care do have ADHD. Children and adolescents with pure TS are not significantly different from their peers without TS on ratings of aggressive behaviors or conduct disorders, or on measures of social adaptation. Similarly, adults with pure TS do not appear to have the social difficulties present in those with TS plus ADHD.

Among those with an older age of onset, more substance abuse and mood disorders are found, and there may be self-injurious tics. Adults who have severe, often treatment-resistant tics are more likely to also have mood disorders and OCD. Coprolalia is more likely in people with severe tics plus multiple comorbid conditions.

=== Neuropsychological function ===
There are no major impairments in neuropsychological function among people with Tourette&#x27;s, but conditions that occur along with tics can cause variation in neurocognitive function. A better understanding of comorbid conditions is needed to untangle any neuropsychological differences between TS-only individuals and those with comorbid conditions.

Only slight impairments are found in intellectual ability, attentional ability, and nonverbal memory—but ADHD, other comorbid disorders, or tic severity could account for these differences. In contrast with earlier findings, visual motor integration and visuoconstructive skills are not found to be impaired, while comorbid conditions may have a small effect on motor skills. Comorbid conditions and severity of tics may account for variable results in verbal fluency, which can be slightly impaired. There might be slight impairment in social cognition, but not in the ability to plan or make decisions. Children with TS-only do not show cognitive deficits. They are faster than average for their age on timed tests of motor coordination, and constant tic suppression may lead to an advantage in switching between tasks because of increased inhibitory control.

Learning disabilities may be present, but whether they are due to tics or comorbid conditions is controversial; older studies that reported higher rates of learning disability did not control well for the presence of comorbid conditions. There are often difficulties with handwriting, and disabilities in written expression and math are reported in those with TS plus other conditions.

== Causes ==

The exact cause of Tourette&#x27;s is unknown, but it is well established that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. Genetic epidemiology studies have shown that Tourette&#x27;s is highly heritable, and 10 to 100 times more likely to be found among close family members than in the general population. The exact mode of inheritance is not known; no single gene has been identified, and hundreds of genes are likely involved. Genome-wide association studies were published in 2013 and 2015 in which no finding reached a threshold for significance; a 2019 meta-analysis found only a single genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 13, but that result was not found in broader samples. Twin studies show that 50 to 77% of identical twins share a TS diagnosis, while only 10 to 23% of fraternal twins do. But not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms. A few rare highly penetrant genetic mutations have been found that explain only a small number of cases in single families (the &quot;SLITRK1, HDC&quot;, and &quot;CNTNAP2&quot; genes).

Psychosocial or other non-genetic factors—while not causing Tourette&#x27;s—can affect the severity of TS in vulnerable individuals and influence the expression of the inherited genes. Pre-natal and peri-natal events increase the risk that a tic disorder or comorbid OCD will be expressed in those with the genetic vulnerability. These include paternal age; forceps delivery; stress or severe nausea during pregnancy; and use of tobacco, caffeine, alcohol, and cannabis during pregnancy. Babies who are born premature with low birthweight, or who have low Apgar scores, are also at increased risk; in premature twins, the lower birthweight twin is more likely to develop TS.

Autoimmune processes may affect the onset of tics or exacerbate them. Both OCD and tic disorders are hypothesized to arise in a subset of children as a result of a post-streptococcal autoimmune process. Its potential effect is described by the controversial hypothesis called PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections), which proposes five criteria for diagnosis in children. PANDAS and the newer pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) hypotheses are the focus of clinical and laboratory research, but remain unproven. There is also a broader hypothesis that links immune-system abnormalities and immune dysregulation with TS.

Some forms of OCD may be genetically linked to Tourette&#x27;s, although the genetic factors in OCD with and without tics may differ. The genetic relationship of ADHD to Tourette syndrome, however, has not been fully established. A genetic link between autism and Tourette&#x27;s has not been established as of 2017.

== Mechanism ==

The exact mechanism affecting the inherited vulnerability to Tourette&#x27;s is not well established. Tics are believed to result from dysfunction in cortical and subcortical brain regions: the thalamus, basal ganglia and frontal cortex. Neuroanatomic models suggest failures in circuits connecting the brain&#x27;s cortex and subcortex; imaging techniques implicate the frontal cortex and basal ganglia. In the 2010s, neuroimaging and postmortem brain studies, as well as animal and genetic studies, made progress towards better understanding the neurobiological mechanisms leading to Tourette&#x27;s. These studies support the basal ganglia model, in which neurons in the striatum are activated and inhibit outputs from the basal ganglia.

Cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits, or neural pathways, provide inputs to the basal ganglia from the cortex. These circuits connect the basal ganglia with other areas of the brain to transfer information that regulates planning and control of movements, behavior, decision-making, and learning. Behavior is regulated by cross-connections that &quot;allow the integration of information&quot; from these circuits. Involuntary movements may result from impairments in these CSTC circuits, including the sensorimotor, limbic, language and decision making pathways. Abnormalities in these circuits may be responsible for tics and premonitory urges.

The caudate nuclei may be smaller in subjects with tics compared to those without tics, supporting the hypothesis of pathology in CSTC circuits in Tourette&#x27;s. The ability to suppress tics depends on brain circuits that &quot;regulate response inhibition and cognitive control of motor behavior&quot;. Children with TS are found to have a larger prefrontal cortex, which may be the result of an adaptation to help regulate tics. It is likely that tics decrease with age as the capacity of the frontal cortex increases. Cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuits may also be impaired, contributing to &quot;sensory, limbic and executive&quot; features. The release of dopamine in the basal ganglia is higher in people with Tourette&#x27;s, implicating biochemical changes from &quot;overactive and dysregulated dopaminergic transmissions&quot;.

Histamine and the H3 receptor may play a role in the alterations of neural circuitry. A reduced level of histamine in the H3 receptor may result in an increase in other neurotransmitters, causing tics. Postmortem studies have also implicated &quot;dysregulation of neuroinflammatory processes&quot;.

== Diagnosis ==
According to the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-5), Tourette&#x27;s may be diagnosed when a person exhibits both multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics over a period of one year. The motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred before the age of 18 and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—for example, autism or other causes of tics—must be ruled out.

Patients referred for a tic disorder are assessed based on their family history of tics, vulnerability to ADHD, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and a number of other chronic medical, psychiatric and neurological conditions. In individuals with a typical onset and a family history of tics or OCD, a basic physical and neurological examination may be sufficient. There are no specific medical or screening tests that can be used to diagnose Tourette&#x27;s; the diagnosis is usually made based on observation of the individual&#x27;s symptoms and family history, and after ruling out secondary causes of tic disorders (tourettism).

Delayed diagnosis often occurs because professionals mistakenly believe that TS is rare, always involves coprolalia, or must be severely impairing. The DSM has recognized since 2000 that many individuals with Tourette&#x27;s do not have significant impairment; diagnosis does not require the presence of coprolalia or a comorbid condition, such as ADHD or OCD. Tourette&#x27;s may be misdiagnosed because of the wide expression of severity, ranging from mild (in the majority of cases) or moderate, to severe (the rare but more widely recognized and publicized cases). About 20% of people with Tourette syndrome do not realize that they have tics.

Tics that appear early in the course of TS are often confused with allergies, asthma, vision problems, and other conditions. Pediatricians, allergists and ophthalmologists are among the first to see or identify a child as having tics, although the majority of tics are first identified by the child&#x27;s parents. Coughing, blinking, and tics that mimic unrelated conditions such as asthma are commonly misdiagnosed. In the UK, there is an average delay of three years between symptom onset and diagnosis. 

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Tics that may appear to mimic those of Tourette&#x27;s—but are associated with disorders other than Tourette&#x27;s—are known as tourettism and are ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. The abnormal movements associated with choreas, dystonias, myoclonus, and dyskinesias are distinct from the tics of Tourette&#x27;s in that they are more rhythmic, not suppressible, and not preceded by an unwanted urge. Developmental and autism spectrum disorders may manifest tics, other stereotyped movements, and stereotypic movement disorder. The stereotyped movements associated with autism typically have an earlier age of onset; are more symmetrical, rhythmical and bilateral; and involve the extremities (for example, flapping the hands).

If another condition might better explain the tics, tests may be done; for example, if there is diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity, an EEG may be ordered. An MRI can rule out brain abnormalities, but such brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. Measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone blood levels can rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. If there is a family history of liver disease, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson&#x27;s disease. The typical age of onset of TS is before adolescence. In teenagers and adults with an abrupt onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for stimulants might be requested.

Increasing episodes of tic-like behavior among teenagers (predominantly adolescent girls) were reported in several countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers linked their occurrence to followers of certain TikTok or YouTube artists. Described in 2006 as &quot;psychogenic&quot;, abrupt-onset movements resembling tics are referred to as a &quot;functional movement disorder&quot; or &quot;functional tic-like movements&quot;. Functional tic-like movements can be difficult to distinguish from tics that have an organic (rather than psychological) cause. They may occur alone or co-exist in individuals with tic disorders. These tics are inconsistent with the classic tics of TS in several ways: the premonitory urge (present in 90% of those with tics disorders) is absent in functional tic-like movements; the suppressibility seen in tic disorders is lacking; there is no family or childhood history of tics and there is a female predominance in functional tics, with a later-than-typical age of first presentation; onset is more abrupt than typical with movements that are more suggestible; and there is less co-occurring OCD or ADHD and more co-occurring disorders. Functional tics are &quot;not fully stereotypical&quot;, do not respond to medications, do not demonstrate the classic waxing and waning pattern of Tourettic tics, and do not progress in the typical fashion, in which tics often first appear in the face and gradually move to limbs.

Other conditions that may manifest tics include Sydenham&#x27;s chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington&#x27;s disease, neuroacanthocytosis, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson&#x27;s disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The extreme self-injurious behaviors of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may be confused with Tourette syndrome or stereotypies, but self-injury is rare in TS even in cases of violent tics. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out without medical or screening tests.

=== Screening for other conditions ===
Although not all those with Tourette&#x27;s have comorbid conditions, most presenting for clinical care exhibit symptoms of other conditions along with their tics. ADHD and OCD are the most common, but autism spectrum disorders or anxiety, mood, personality, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders may also be present. Learning disabilities and sleep disorders may be present; higher rates of sleep disturbance and migraine than in the general population are reported. A thorough evaluation for comorbidity is called for when symptoms and impairment warrant, and careful assessment of people with TS includes comprehensive screening for these conditions.

Comorbid conditions such as OCD and ADHD can be more impairing than tics, and cause greater impact on overall functioning. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in individuals with comorbid Tourette&#x27;s and ADHD may be accounted for by the ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying comorbid conditions. Children and adolescents with TS who have learning difficulties are candidates for psychoeducational testing, particularly if the child also has ADHD.

== Management ==
There is no cure for Tourette&#x27;s. There is no single most effective medication, and no one medication effectively treats all symptoms. Most medications prescribed for tics have not been approved for that use, and no medication is without the risk of significant adverse effects. Treatment is focused on identifying the most troubling or impairing symptoms and helping the individual manage them. Because comorbid conditions are often a larger source of impairment than tics, they are a priority in treatment. The management of Tourette&#x27;s is individualized and involves shared decision-making between the clinician, patient, family and caregivers. Practice guidelines for the treatment of tics were published by the American Academy of Neurology in 2019.

Education, reassurance and psychobehavioral therapy are often sufficient for the majority of cases. In particular, psychoeducation targeting the patient and their family and surrounding community is a key management strategy. Watchful waiting &quot;is an acceptable approach&quot; for those who are not functionally impaired. Symptom management may include behavioral, psychological and pharmacological therapies. Pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, while psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may ameliorate depression and social isolation, and improve family support. The decision to use behavioral or pharmacological treatment is &quot;usually made after the educational and supportive interventions have been in place for a period of months, and it is clear that the tic symptoms are persistently severe and are themselves a source of impairment in terms of self-esteem, relationships with the family or peers, or school performance&quot;.

=== Psychoeducation and social support ===

Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders, and psychoeducation is the first step. A child&#x27;s parents are typically the first to notice their tics; they may feel worried, imagine that they are somehow responsible, or feel burdened by misinformation about Tourette&#x27;s. Effectively educating parents about the diagnosis and providing social support can ease their anxiety. This support can also lower the chance that their child will be unnecessarily medicated or experience an exacerbation of tics due to their parents&#x27; emotional state.

People with Tourette&#x27;s may suffer socially if their tics are viewed as &quot;bizarre&quot;. If a child has disabling tics, or tics that interfere with social or academic functioning, supportive psychotherapy or school accommodations can be helpful. Even children with milder tics may be angry, depressed or have low self-esteem as a result of increased teasing, bullying, rejection by peers or social stigmatization, and this can lead to social withdrawal. Some children feel empowered by presenting a peer awareness program to their classmates. It can be helpful to educate teachers and school staff about typical tics, how they fluctuate during the day, how they impact the child, and how to distinguish tics from naughty behavior. By learning to identify tics, adults can refrain from asking or expecting a child to stop ticcing, because &quot;tic suppression can be exhausting, unpleasant, and attention-demanding and can result in a subsequent rebound bout of tics&quot;.

Adults with TS may withdraw socially to avoid stigmatization and discrimination because of their tics. Depending on their country&#x27;s healthcare system, they may receive social services or help from support groups.

=== Behavioral ===

Behavioral therapies using habit reversal training (HRT) and exposure and response prevention (ERP) are first-line interventions in the management of Tourette syndrome, and have been shown to be effective. Because tics are somewhat suppressible, when people with TS are aware of the premonitory urge that precedes a tic, they can be trained to develop a response to the urge that competes with the tic. Comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) is based on HRT, the best researched behavioral therapy for tics. TS experts debate whether increasing a child&#x27;s awareness of tics with HRT/CBIT (as opposed to ignoring tics) can lead to more tics later in life.

When disruptive behaviors related to comorbid conditions exist, anger control training and parent management training can be effective. CBT is a useful treatment when OCD is present. Relaxation techniques, such as exercise, yoga and meditation may be useful in relieving the stress that can aggravate tics. Beyond HRT, the majority of behavioral interventions for Tourette&#x27;s (for example, relaxation training and biofeedback) have not been systematically evaluated and are not empirically supported.

=== Medication ===
Children with tics typically present when their tics are most severe, but because the condition waxes and wanes, medication is not started immediately or changed often. Tics may subside with education, reassurance and a supportive environment. When medication is used, the goal is not to eliminate symptoms. Instead, the lowest dose that manages symptoms without adverse effects is used, because adverse effects may be more disturbing than the symptoms being treated with medication.

The classes of medication with proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. Some antihypertensive agents are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. The antihypertensives clonidine and guanfacine are typically tried first in children; they can also help with ADHD symptoms, but there is less evidence that they are effective for adults. The neuroleptics risperidone and aripiprazole are tried when antihypertensives are not effective, and are generally tried first for adults. Because of lower side effects, aripiprazole is preferred over other antipsychotics. The most effective medication for tics is haloperidol, but it has a higher risk of side effects. Methylphenidate can be used to treat ADHD that co-occurs with tics, and can be used in combination with clonidine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are used to manage anxiety and OCD.

=== Other ===

Complementary and alternative medicine approaches, such as dietary modification, neurofeedback and allergy testing and control have popular appeal, but they have no proven benefit in the management of Tourette syndrome. Despite this lack of evidence, up to two-thirds of parents, caregivers and individuals with TS use dietary approaches and alternative treatments and do not always inform their physicians.

There is low confidence that tics are reduced with tetrahydrocannabinol, and insufficient evidence for other cannabis-based medications in the treatment of Tourette&#x27;s. There is no good evidence supporting the use of acupuncture or transcranial magnetic stimulation; neither is there evidence supporting intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, or antibiotics for the treatment of PANDAS.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a valid option for individuals with severe symptoms that do not respond to conventional therapy and management, although it is an experimental treatment. Selecting candidates who may benefit from DBS is challenging, and the appropriate lower age range for surgery is unclear; it is potentially useful in less than 3% of individuals. The ideal brain location to target has not been identified as of 2019.

=== Pregnancy ===
A quarter of women report that their tics increase before menstruation; however, studies have not shown consistent evidence of a change in frequency or severity of tics related to pregnancy or hormonal levels. Overall, symptoms in women respond better to haloperidol than they do for men.

Most women find they can withdraw from medication during pregnancy without much trouble. When needed, medications are used at the lowest doses possible. During pregnancy, neuroleptic medications are avoided when possible because of the risk of pregnancy complications. When needed, olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine are most often used as they have not been shown to cause fetal abnormalities. One report found that haloperidol could be used during pregnancy, to minimize the side effects in the mother, including low blood pressure, and anticholinergic effects, although it may cross the placenta.

If severe tics might interfere with administration of local anesthesia, other anesthesia options are considered. Neuroleptics in low doses may not affect the breastfed infant, but most medications are avoided. Clonidine and amphetamines may be present in breast milk.

== Prognosis ==

Tourette syndrome is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges from mild to severe. Symptoms typically subside as children pass through adolescence. In a group of ten children at the average age of highest tic severity (around ten or eleven), almost four will see complete remission by adulthood. Another four will have minimal or mild tics in adulthood, but not complete remission. The remaining two will have moderate or severe tics as adults, but only rarely will their symptoms in adulthood be more severe than in childhood.

Regardless of symptom severity, individuals with Tourette&#x27;s have a normal life span. Symptoms may be lifelong and chronic for some, but the condition is not degenerative or life-threatening. Intelligence among those with pure TS follows a normal curve, although there may be small differences in intelligence in those with comorbid conditions. The severity of tics early in life does not predict their severity in later life. There is no reliable means of predicting the course of symptoms for a particular individual, but the prognosis is generally favorable. By the age of fourteen to sixteen, when the highest tic severity has typically passed, a more reliable prognosis might be made.

Tics may be at their highest severity when they are diagnosed, and often improve as an individual&#x27;s family and friends come to better understand the condition. Studies report that almost eight out of ten children with Tourette&#x27;s experience a reduction in the severity of their tics by adulthood, and some adults who still have tics may not be aware that they have them. A study that used video to record tics in adults found that nine out of ten adults still had tics, and half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free displayed evidence of mild tics.
=== Quality of life ===
People with Tourette&#x27;s are affected by the consequences of tics and by the efforts to suppress them. Head and eye tics can interfere with reading or lead to headaches, and forceful tics can lead to repetitive strain injury. Severe tics can lead to pain or injuries; as an example, a rare cervical disc herniation was reported from a neck tic. Some people may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor.

A supportive family and environment generally give those with Tourette&#x27;s the skills to manage the disorder. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished or teased at home or at school is likely to fare worse than a child who enjoyed an understanding environment. The long-lasting effects of bullying and teasing can influence self-esteem, self-confidence, and even employment choices and opportunities. Comorbid ADHD can severely affect the child&#x27;s well-being in all realms, and extend into adulthood.

Factors impacting quality of life change over time, given the natural fluctuating course of tic disorders, the development of coping strategies, and a person&#x27;s age. As ADHD symptoms improve with maturity, adults report less negative impact in their occupational lives than do children in their educational lives. Tics have a greater impact on adults&#x27; psychosocial function, including financial burdens, than they do on children. Adults are more likely to report a reduced quality of life due to depression or anxiety; depression contributes a greater burden than tics to adults&#x27; quality of life compared to children. As coping strategies become more effective with age, the impact of OCD symptoms seems to diminish.

== Epidemiology ==
Tourette syndrome is a common but underdiagnosed condition that reaches across all social, racial and ethnic groups. It is three to four times more frequent in males than in females. Observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults because tics tend to remit or subside with maturity and a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults. Up to 1% of the overall population experiences tic disorders, including chronic tics and transient (provisional or unspecified) tics in childhood. Chronic tics affect 5% of children and transient tics affect up to 20%.

Many individuals with tics do not know they have tics, or do not seek a diagnosis, so epidemiological studies of TS &quot;reflect a strong ascertainment bias&quot; towards those with co-occurring conditions. The reported prevalence of TS varies &quot;according to the source, age, and sex of the sample; the ascertainment procedures; and diagnostic system&quot;, with a range reported between 0.15% and 3.0% for children and adolescents. Sukhodolsky, et al. wrote in 2017 that the best estimate of TS prevalence in children was 1.4%. Both Robertson and Stern state that the prevalence in children is 1%. The prevalence of TS in the general population is estimated as 0.3% to 1.0%. According to turn of the century census data, these prevalence estimates translated to half a million children in the US with TS and half a million people in the UK with TS, although symptoms in many older individuals would be almost unrecognizable.

Tourette syndrome was once thought to be rare: in 1972, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) believed there were fewer than 100 cases in the United States, and a 1973 registry reported only 485 cases worldwide. However, numerous studies published since 2000 have consistently demonstrated that the prevalence is much higher. Recognizing that tics may often be undiagnosed and hard to detect, newer studies use direct classroom observation and multiple informants (parents, teachers and trained observers), and therefore record more cases than older studies. As the diagnostic threshold and assessment methodology have moved towards recognition of milder cases, the estimated prevalence has increased.

Because of the high male prevalence of TS, there is limited data on females from which conclusion about gender-based differences can be drawn; caution may be warranted in extending conclusions to females regarding the characteristics and treatment of tics based on studies of mostly males. A 2021 review stated that females may see a later peak than males in symptoms, with less remission over time, along with a higher prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders.

== History ==

A French doctor, Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, reported the first case of Tourette syndrome in 1825, describing the Marquise de Dampierre, an important woman of nobility in her time. In 1884, Jean-Martin Charcot, an influential French physician, assigned his student and intern Georges Gilles de la Tourette, to study patients with movement disorders at the Salpêtrière Hospital, with the goal of defining a condition distinct from hysteria and chorea. In 1885, Gilles de la Tourette published an account in &quot;Study of a Nervous Affliction&quot; of nine people with &quot;convulsive tic disorder&quot;, concluding that a new clinical category should be defined. The eponym was bestowed by Charcot after and on behalf of Gilles de la Tourette, who later became Charcot&#x27;s senior resident.

Following the 19th-century descriptions, a psychogenic view prevailed and little progress was made in explaining or treating tics until well into the 20th century. The possibility that movement disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis lethargica epidemic from 1918 to 1926 was linked to an increase in tic disorders.

During the 1960s and 1970s, as the beneficial effects of haloperidol on tics became known, the psychoanalytic approach to Tourette syndrome was questioned. The turning point came in 1965, when Arthur K. Shapiro—described as &quot;the father of modern tic disorder research&quot;—used haloperidol to treat a person with Tourette&#x27;s, and published a paper criticizing the psychoanalytic approach. In 1975, &quot;The New York Times&quot; headlined an article with &quot;Bizarre outbursts of Tourette&#x27;s disease victims linked to chemical disorder in brain&quot;, and Shapiro said: &quot;The bizarre symptoms of this illness are rivaled only by the bizarre treatments used to treat it.&quot;

During the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette&#x27;s emerged, in which a genetic predisposition is seen to interact with non-genetic and environmental factors. The fourth revision of the DSM (DSM-IV) in 1994 added a diagnostic requirement for &quot;marked distress or significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning&quot;, which led to an outcry from TS experts and researchers, who noted that many people were not even aware they had TS, nor were they distressed by their tics; clinicians and researchers resorted to using the older criteria in research and practice. In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association revised its diagnostic criteria in the fourth text revision of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR) to remove the impairment requirement, recognizing that clinicians often see people who have Tourette&#x27;s without distress or impairment.

== Society and culture ==


Not everyone with Tourette&#x27;s wants treatment or a cure, especially if that means they may lose something else in the process. The researchers Leckman and Cohen believe that there may be latent advantages associated with an individual&#x27;s genetic vulnerability to developing Tourette syndrome that may have adaptive value, such as heightened awareness and increased attention to detail and surroundings.

Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers and professionals from all walks of life are found among people with Tourette&#x27;s. The athlete Tim Howard, described by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as the &quot;rarest of creatures—an American soccer hero&quot;, and by the Tourette Syndrome Association as the &quot;most notable individual with Tourette Syndrome around the world&quot;, says that his neurological makeup gave him an enhanced perception and an acute focus that contributed to his success on the field.

Samuel Johnson is a historical figure who likely had Tourette syndrome, as evidenced by the writings of his friend James Boswell. Johnson wrote &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; in 1747, and was a prolific writer, poet, and critic. There is little support for speculation that Mozart had Tourette&#x27;s: the potentially coprolalic aspect of vocal tics is not transferred to writing, so Mozart&#x27;s scatological writings are not relevant; the composer&#x27;s available medical history is not thorough; the side effects of other conditions may be misinterpreted; and &quot;the evidence of motor tics in Mozart&#x27;s life is doubtful&quot;.
Likely portrayals of TS or tic disorders in fiction predating Gilles de la Tourette&#x27;s work are &quot;Mr. Pancks&quot; in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; and &quot;Nikolai Levin&quot; in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. The entertainment industry has been criticized for depicting those with Tourette syndrome as social misfits whose only tic is coprolalia, which has furthered the public&#x27;s misunderstanding and stigmatization of those with Tourette&#x27;s. The coprolalic symptoms of Tourette&#x27;s are also fodder for radio and television talk shows in the US and for the British media. High-profile media coverage focuses on treatments that do not have established safety or efficacy, such as deep brain stimulation, and alternative therapies involving unstudied efficacy and side effects are pursued by many parents.

== Research directions ==
Research since 1999 has advanced knowledge of Tourette&#x27;s in the areas of genetics, neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and neuropathology, but questions remain about how best to classify it and how closely it is related to other movement or psychiatric disorders. Modeled after genetic breakthroughs seen with large-scale efforts in other neurodevelopmental disorders, three groups are collaborating in research of the genetics of Tourette&#x27;s:
*The Tourette Syndrome Association International Consortium for Genetics (TSAICG)
*Tourette International Collaborative Genetics Study (TIC Genetics)
*European Multicentre Tics in Children Studies (EMTICS)

Compared to the progress made in gene discovery in certain neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders—autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder—the scale of related TS research is lagging in the United States due to funding.

<text>A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. The exact frequency response of the filter depends on the filter design. The filter is sometimes called a high-cut filter, or treble-cut filter in audio applications. A low-pass filter is the complement of a high-pass filter.

In optics, high-pass and low-pass may have different meanings, depending on whether referring to the frequency or wavelength of light, since these variables are inversely related. High-pass frequency filters would act as low-pass wavelength filters, and vice versa. For this reason, it is a good practice to refer to wavelength filters as &quot;short-pass&quot; and &quot;long-pass&quot; to avoid confusion, which would correspond to &quot;high-pass&quot; and &quot;low-pass&quot; frequencies.

Low-pass filters exist in many different forms, including electronic circuits such as a &quot;hiss filter&quot; used in audio, anti-aliasing filters for conditioning signals before analog-to-digital conversion, digital filters for smoothing sets of data, acoustic barriers, blurring of images, and so on. The moving average operation used in fields such as finance is a particular kind of low-pass filter and can be analyzed with the same signal processing techniques as are used for other low-pass filters. Low-pass filters provide a smoother form of a signal, removing the short-term fluctuations and leaving the longer-term trend.

Filter designers will often use the low-pass form as a prototype filter. That is a filter with unity bandwidth and impedance. The desired filter is obtained from the prototype by scaling for the desired bandwidth and impedance and transforming into the desired bandform (that is, low-pass, high-pass, band-pass or band-stop).

==Examples==
Examples of low-pass filters occur in acoustics, optics and electronics.

A stiff physical barrier tends to reflect higher sound frequencies, acting as an acoustic low-pass filter for transmitting sound. When music is playing in another room, the low notes are easily heard, while the high notes are attenuated.

An optical filter with the same function can correctly be called a low-pass filter, but conventionally is called a &quot;longpass&quot; filter (low frequency is long wavelength), to avoid confusion.

In an electronic low-pass RC filter for voltage signals, high frequencies in the input signal are attenuated, but the filter has little attenuation below the cutoff frequency determined by its RC time constant. For current signals, a similar circuit, using a resistor and capacitor in parallel, works in a similar manner. (See current divider discussed in more detail below.)

Electronic low-pass filters are used on inputs to subwoofers and other types of loudspeakers, to block high pitches that they cannot efficiently reproduce. Radio transmitters use low-pass filters to block harmonic emissions that might interfere with other communications. The tone knob on many electric guitars is a low-pass filter used to reduce the amount of treble in the sound. An integrator is another time constant low-pass filter.

Telephone lines fitted with DSL splitters use low-pass filters to separate DSL from POTS signals (and high-pass vice versa), which share the same pair of wires (&quot;transmission channel&quot;).

Low-pass filters also play a significant role in the sculpting of sound created by analogue and virtual analogue synthesisers. &quot;See subtractive synthesis.&quot;

A low-pass filter is used as an anti-aliasing filter before sampling and for reconstruction in digital-to-analog conversion.

==Ideal and real filters==
An ideal low-pass filter completely eliminates all frequencies above the cutoff frequency while passing those below unchanged; its frequency response is a rectangular function and is a brick-wall filter. The transition region present in practical filters does not exist in an ideal filter. An ideal low-pass filter can be realized mathematically (theoretically) by multiplying a signal by the rectangular function in the frequency domain or, equivalently, convolution with its impulse response, a sinc function, in the time domain.

However, the ideal filter is impossible to realize without also having signals of infinite extent in time, and so generally needs to be approximated for real ongoing signals, because the sinc function&#x27;s support region extends to all past and future times. The filter would therefore need to have infinite delay, or knowledge of the infinite future and past, to perform the convolution. It is effectively realizable for pre-recorded digital signals by assuming extensions of zero into the past and future, or, more typically, by making the signal repetitive and using Fourier analysis.

Real filters for real-time applications approximate the ideal filter by truncating and windowing the infinite impulse response to make a finite impulse response; applying that filter requires delaying the signal for a moderate period of time, allowing the computation to &quot;see&quot; a little bit into the future. This delay is manifested as phase shift. Greater accuracy in approximation requires a longer delay.

Truncating an ideal low-pass filter result in ringing artifacts via the Gibbs phenomenon, which can be reduced or worsened by the choice of windowing function. Design and choice of real filters involves understanding and minimizing these artifacts. For example, simple truncation of the sinc function will create severe ringing artifacts, which can be reduced using window functions that drop off more smoothly at the edges.

The Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula describes how to use a perfect low-pass filter to reconstruct a continuous signal from a sampled digital signal. Real digital-to-analog converters uses real filter approximations.

==Time response==

The time response of a low-pass filter is found by solving the response to the simple low-pass RC filter.

Using Kirchhoff&#x27;s Laws we arrive at the differential equation

:formula_1

=== Step input response example ===
If we let formula_2 be a step function of magnitude formula_3 then the differential equation has the solution
:formula_4
where formula_5 is the cutoff frequency of the filter.

== Frequency response ==
The most common way to characterize the frequency response of a circuit is to find its Laplace transform transfer function, formula_6. Taking the Laplace transform of our differential equation and solving for formula_7 we get

:formula_8

== Difference equation through discrete time sampling ==
A discrete difference equation is easily obtained by sampling the step input response above at regular intervals of formula_9 where formula_10 and formula_11 is the time between samples. Taking the difference between two consecutive samples we have

:formula_12

Solving for formula_13 we get

:formula_14

Where formula_15

Using the notation formula_16 and formula_17, and substituting our sampled value, formula_18, we get the difference equation

:formula_19

=== Error analysis ===
Comparing the reconstructed output signal from the difference equation, formula_19, to the step input response, formula_21, we find that there is an exact reconstruction (0% error). This is the reconstructed output for a time-invariant input. However, if the input is &quot;time variant&quot;, such as formula_22, this model approximates the input signal as a series of step functions with duration formula_11 producing an error in the reconstructed output signal. The error produced from &quot;time variant&quot; inputs is difficult to quantify but decreases as formula_24.

==Discrete-time realization==
Many digital filters are designed to give low-pass characteristics. Both infinite impulse response and finite impulse response low pass filters, as well as filters using Fourier transforms, are widely used.

===Simple infinite impulse response filter===

The effect of an infinite impulse response low-pass filter can be simulated on a computer by analyzing an RC filter&#x27;s behavior in the time domain, and then discretizing the model.
From the circuit diagram to the right, according to Kirchhoff&#x27;s Laws and the definition of capacitance:
(t) - v_{\text{out}}(t) = R \; i(t)&lt;/math&gt;|}}
(t)&lt;/math&gt;|}}
where formula_25 is the charge stored in the capacitor at time . Substituting equation into equation gives formula_26, which can be substituted into equation so that
:formula_27

This equation can be discretized. For simplicity, assume that samples of the input and output are taken at evenly spaced points in time separated by formula_28 time. Let the samples of formula_29 be represented by the sequence formula_30, and let formula_31 be represented by the sequence formula_32, which correspond to the same points in time. Making these substitutions,
:formula_33
Rearranging terms gives the recurrence relation
:formula_34

That is, this discrete-time implementation of a simple &quot;RC&quot; low-pass filter is the exponentially weighted moving average
:formula_35

By definition, the &quot;smoothing factor&quot; is within the range formula_36. The expression for yields the equivalent time constant in terms of the sampling period formula_28 and smoothing factor ,
:formula_38
Recalling that
:formula_39 so formula_40
note and formula_41 are related by,
:formula_42
and
:formula_43

If =0.5, then the &quot;RC&quot; time constant equals the sampling period. If formula_44, then &quot;RC&quot; is significantly larger than the sampling interval, and formula_45.

The filter recurrence relation provides a way to determine the output samples in terms of the input samples and the preceding output. The following pseudocode algorithm simulates the effect of a low-pass filter on a series of digital samples:

 // Return RC low-pass filter output samples, given input samples,
 // time interval &quot;dt&quot;, and time constant &quot;RC&quot;
 function lowpass(&quot;real[1..n]&quot; x, &quot;real&quot; dt, &quot;real&quot; RC)
 var &quot;real[1..n]&quot; y
 var &quot;real&quot; α := dt / (RC + dt)
 y[1] := α * x[1]
 for i from 2 to n
 y[i] := α * x[i] + (1-α) * y[i-1]
 return y

The loop that calculates each of the &quot;n&quot; outputs can be refactored into the equivalent:

 for i from 2 to n
 y[i] := y[i-1] + α * (x[i] - y[i-1])

That is, the change from one filter output to the next is proportional to the difference between the previous output and the next input. This exponential smoothing property matches the exponential decay seen in the continuous-time system. As expected, as the time constant &quot;RC&quot; increases, the discrete-time smoothing parameter formula_46 decreases, and the output samples formula_32 respond more slowly to a change in the input samples formula_48; the system has more &quot;inertia&quot;. This filter is an infinite-impulse-response (IIR) single-pole low-pass filter.

===Finite impulse response===
Finite-impulse-response filters can be built that approximate the sinc function time-domain response of an ideal sharp-cutoff low-pass filter. For minimum distortion, the finite impulse response filter has an unbounded number of coefficients operating on an unbounded signal. In practice, the time-domain response must be time truncated and is often of a simplified shape; in the simplest case, a running average can be used, giving a square time response.

===Fourier transform===
For non-realtime filtering, to achieve a low pass filter, the entire signal is usually taken as a looped signal, the Fourier transform is taken, filtered in the frequency domain, followed by an inverse Fourier transform. Only O(n log(n)) operations are required compared to O(n2) for the time domain filtering algorithm.

This can also sometimes be done in real time, where the signal is delayed long enough to perform the Fourier transformation on shorter, overlapping blocks.

==Continuous-time realization==
There are many different types of filter circuits, with different responses to changing frequency. The frequency response of a filter is generally represented using a Bode plot, and the filter is characterized by its cutoff frequency and rate of frequency rolloff. In all cases, at the &quot;cutoff frequency,&quot; the filter attenuates the input power by half or 3 dB. So the order of the filter determines the amount of additional attenuation for frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.
* A first-order filter, for example, reduces the signal amplitude by half (so power reduces by a factor of 4, or , every time the frequency doubles (goes up one octave); more precisely, the power rolloff approaches 20 dB per decade in the limit of high frequency. The magnitude Bode plot for a first-order filter looks like a horizontal line below the cutoff frequency, and a diagonal line above the cutoff frequency. There is also a &quot;knee curve&quot; at the boundary between the two, smoothly transitioning between the two straight-line regions. If the transfer function of a first-order low-pass filter has a zero as well as a pole, the Bode plot flattens out again, at some maximum attenuation of high frequencies; such an effect is caused for example by a little bit of the input leaking around the one-pole filter; this one-pole–one-zero filter is still a first-order low-pass. &quot;See Pole–zero plot and RC circuit.&quot;
* A second-order filter attenuates high frequencies more steeply. The Bode plot for this type of filter resembles that of a first-order filter, except that it falls off more quickly. For example, a second-order Butterworth filter reduces the signal amplitude to one-fourth of its original level every time the frequency doubles (so power decreases by 12 dB per octave, or 40 dB per decade). Other all-pole second-order filters may roll off at different rates initially depending on their Q factor, but approach the same final rate of 12 dB per octave; as with the first-order filters, zeroes in the transfer function can change the high-frequency asymptote. See RLC circuit.
* Third- and higher-order filters are defined similarly. In general, the final rate of power rolloff for an order- all-pole filter is 6 dB per octave (20 dB per decade).

On any Butterworth filter, if one extends the horizontal line to the right and the diagonal line to the upper-left (the asymptotes of the function), they intersect at exactly the &quot;cutoff frequency&quot;, 3 dB below the horizontal line. The various types of filters (Butterworth filter, Chebyshev filter, Bessel filter, etc.) all have different-looking &quot;knee curves&quot;. Many second-order filters have &quot;peaking&quot; or resonance that puts their frequency response &quot;above&quot; the horizontal line at this peak.

The meanings of &#x27;low&#x27; and &#x27;high&#x27;—that is, the cutoff frequency—depend on the characteristics of the filter. The term &quot;low-pass filter&quot; merely refers to the shape of the filter&#x27;s response; a high-pass filter could be built that cuts off at a lower frequency than any low-pass filter—it is their responses that set them apart. Electronic circuits can be devised for any desired frequency range, right up through microwave frequencies (above 1 GHz) and higher.

===Laplace notation===
Continuous-time filters can also be described in terms of the Laplace transform of their impulse response, in a way that makes it easy to analyze all characteristics of the filter by considering the pattern of poles and zeros of the Laplace transform in the complex plane. (In discrete time, one can similarly consider the Z-transform of the impulse response.)

For example, a first-order low-pass filter can be described by the continuous time transfer function, in the Laplace domain, as:
:formula_49

where &quot;H&quot; is the transfer function, &quot;s&quot; is the Laplace transform variable (complex angular frequency), &quot;τ&quot; is the filter time constant, formula_50 is the cutoff frequency, and &quot;K&quot; is the gain of the filter in the passband. The cutoff frequency is related to the time constant by:
:formula_51

== Electronic low-pass filters ==
===First-order passive===

==== RC filter ====

One simple low-pass filter circuit consists of a resistor in series with a load, and a capacitor in parallel with the load. The capacitor exhibits reactance, and blocks low-frequency signals, forcing them through the load instead. At higher frequencies, the reactance drops, and the capacitor effectively functions as a short circuit. The combination of resistance and capacitance gives the time constant of the filter formula_52 (represented by the Greek letter tau). The break frequency, also called the turnover frequency, corner frequency, or cutoff frequency (in hertz), is determined by the time constant:

:formula_53

or equivalently (in radians per second):

:formula_54

This circuit may be understood by considering the time the capacitor needs to charge or discharge through the resistor:
* At low frequencies, there is plenty of time for the capacitor to charge up to practically the same voltage as the input voltage.
* At high frequencies, the capacitor only has time to charge up a small amount before the input switches direction. The output goes up and down only a small fraction of the amount the input goes up and down. At double the frequency, there&#x27;s only time for it to charge up half the amount.

Another way to understand this circuit is through the concept of reactance at a particular frequency:
* Since direct current (DC) cannot flow through the capacitor, DC input must flow out the path marked formula_55 (analogous to removing the capacitor).
* Since alternating current (AC) flows very well through the capacitor, almost as well as it flows through a solid wire, AC input flows out through the capacitor, effectively short circuiting to the ground (analogous to replacing the capacitor with just a wire).

The capacitor is not an &quot;on/off&quot; object (like the block or pass fluidic explanation above). The capacitor variably acts between these two extremes. It is the Bode plot and frequency response that show this variability.

====RL filter====

A resistor–inductor circuit or RL filter is an electric circuit composed of resistors and inductors driven by a voltage or current source. A first-order RL circuit is composed of one resistor and one inductor and is the simplest type of RL circuit.

A first-order RL circuit is one of the simplest analogue infinite impulse response electronic filters. It consists of a resistor and an inductor, either in series driven by a voltage source or in parallel driven by a current source.

=== Second-order passive ===

====RLC filter====

An RLC circuit (the letters R, L, and C can be in a different sequence) is an electrical circuit consisting of a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, connected in series or in parallel. The RLC part of the name is due to those letters being the usual electrical symbols for resistance, inductance, and capacitance, respectively. The circuit forms a harmonic oscillator for current and will resonate in a similar way as an LC circuit will. The main difference that the presence of the resistor makes is that any oscillation induced in the circuit will die away over time if it is not kept going by a source. This effect of the resistor is called damping. The presence of the resistance also reduces the peak resonant frequency somewhat. Some resistance is unavoidable in real circuits, even if a resistor is not specifically included as a component. An ideal, pure LC circuit is an abstraction for the purpose of theory.

There are many applications for this circuit. They are used in many different types of oscillator circuits. Another important application is for tuning, such as in radio receivers or television sets, where they are used to select a narrow range of frequencies from the ambient radio waves. In this role, the circuit is often called a tuned circuit. An RLC circuit can be used as a band-pass filter, band-stop filter, low-pass filter, or high-pass filter. The RLC filter is described as a &quot;second-order&quot; circuit, meaning that any voltage or current in the circuit can be described by a second-order differential equation in circuit analysis.

==== Second-order low-pass filter in standard form ====

The transfer function formula_56 of a second-order low-pass filter can be expressed as a function of frequency formula_57 as shown in Equation 1, the Second-Order Low-Pass Filter Standard Form.

:formula_58

In this equation, formula_57 is the frequency variable, formula_41 is the cutoff frequency, formula_61 is the frequency scaling factor, and formula_62 is the quality factor. Equation 1 describes three regions of operation: below cutoff, in the area of cutoff, and above cutoff. For each area, Equation 1 reduces to:

* formula_63: formula_64 - The circuit passes signals multiplied by the gain factor formula_65.
* formula_66: formula_67 - Signals are phase-shifted 90° and modified by the quality factor formula_62.
* formula_69: formula_70 - Signals are phase-shifted 180° and attenuated by the square of the frequency ratio. This behavior is detailed by Jim Karki in &quot;Active Low-Pass Filter Design&quot; (Texas Instruments, 2023).

With attenuation at frequencies above formula_41 increasing by a power of two, the last formula describes a second-order low-pass filter. The frequency scaling factor formula_61 is used to scale the cutoff frequency of the filter so that it follows the definitions given before.

=== Higher order passive filters ===
Higher-order passive filters can also be constructed (see diagram for a third-order example).


===First order active===
An &quot;active&quot; low-pass filter adds an active device to create an active filter that allows for gain in the passband.

In the operational amplifier circuit shown in the figure, the cutoff frequency (in hertz) is defined as:

:formula_73

or equivalently (in radians per second):

:formula_74

The gain in the passband is −&quot;R&quot;2/&quot;R&quot;1, and the stopband drops off at −6 dB per octave (that is −20 dB per decade) as it is a first-order filter.

<text>A high-pass filter (HPF) is an electronic filter that passes signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency. The amount of attenuation for each frequency depends on the filter design. A high-pass filter is usually modeled as a linear time-invariant system. It is sometimes called a low-cut filter or bass-cut filter in the context of audio engineering. High-pass filters have many uses, such as blocking DC from circuitry sensitive to non-zero average voltages or radio frequency devices. They can also be used in conjunction with a low-pass filter to produce a band-pass filter.

In the optical domain filters are often characterised by wavelength rather than frequency. High-pass and low-pass have the opposite meanings, with a &quot;high-pass&quot; filter (more commonly &quot;short-pass&quot;) passing only &quot;shorter&quot; wavelengths (higher frequencies), and vice versa for &quot;low-pass&quot; (more commonly &quot;long-pass&quot;).

==Description==
In electronics, a filter is a two-port electronic circuit which removes frequency components from a signal (time-varying voltage or current) applied to its input port. A high-pass filter attenuates frequency components below a certain frequency, called its cutoff frequency, allowing higher frequency components to pass through. This contrasts with a low-pass filter, which attenuates frequencies higher than a certain frequency, and a bandpass filter, which allows a certain band of frequencies through and attenuates frequencies both higher and lower than the band. 

In optics a high pass filter is a transparent or translucent window of colored material that allows light longer than a certain wavelength to pass through and attenuates light of shorter wavelengths. Since light is often measured not by frequency but by wavelength, which is inversely related to frequency, a high pass optical filter, which attenuates light frequencies below a cutoff frequency, is often called a short-pass filter; it attenuates longer wavelengths.

==Continuous-time circuits==

=== First-order passive ===

A resistor and either a capacitor or an inductor can be configured as a first-order high-pass filter. The simple first-order capacitive high-pass filter shown in Figure 1 is implemented by placing an input voltage across the series combination of a capacitor and a resistor and using the voltage across the resistor as an output. The transfer function of this linear time-invariant system is:

:formula_1

The product of the resistance and capacitance (&quot;R&quot;×&quot;C&quot;) is the time constant (τ); it is inversely proportional to the cutoff frequency &quot;f&quot;&quot;c&quot;, that is,

:formula_2

where &quot;f&quot;&quot;c&quot; is in hertz, &quot;τ&quot; is in seconds, &quot;R&quot; is in ohms, and &quot;C&quot; is in farads. At the cutoff frequency, the filter&#x27;s frequency response reaches -3dB referenced to the gain at an infinite frequency.

=== First-order active ===

Figure 2 shows an active electronic implementation of a first-order high-pass filter using an operational amplifier. The transfer function of this linear time-invariant system is:

:formula_3

In this case, the filter has a passband gain of −&quot;R&quot;2/&quot;R&quot;1 and has a cutoff frequency of

:formula_4

Because this filter is active, it may have non-unity passband gain. That is, high-frequency signals are inverted and amplified by &quot;R&quot;2/&quot;R&quot;1.

All of these first-order high-pass filters are called differentiators, because they perform differentiation for signals whose frequency band is well below the filter&#x27;s cutoff frequency.
=== Higher orders ===
Filters of higher order have steeper slope in the stopband, such that the slope of n-order filters equals 20n dB per decade. Higher order filters can be achieved simply by cascading these first order filters. While impedance matching and loading must be taken into account when chaining passive filters, active filters can be easily chained because the signal is restored by the output of the op amp at each stage. Various filter topologies and network synthesis filters for higher orders exist, which ease design.

== Discrete-time realization ==
Discrete-time high-pass filters can also be designed. Discrete-time filter design is beyond the scope of this article; however, a simple example comes from the conversion of the continuous-time high-pass filter above to a discrete-time realization. That is, the continuous-time behavior can be discretized.

From the circuit in Figure 1 above, according to Kirchhoff&#x27;s Laws and the definition of capacitance:

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the charge stored in the capacitor at time formula_7. Substituting Equation (Q) into Equation (I) and then Equation (I) into Equation (V) gives:

:formula_8

This equation can be discretized. For simplicity, assume that samples of the input and output are taken at evenly spaced points in time separated by formula_9 time. Let the samples of formula_10 be represented by the sequence formula_11, and let formula_12 be represented by the sequence formula_13 which correspond to the same points in time. Making these substitutions:

:formula_14

And rearranging terms gives the recurrence relation

:formula_15

That is, this discrete-time implementation of a simple continuous-time RC high-pass filter is

:formula_16

By definition, formula_17. The expression for parameter formula_18 yields the equivalent time constant formula_19 in terms of the sampling period formula_9 and formula_18:

:formula_22.
Recalling that
:formula_23 so formula_24
then formula_18 and formula_26 are related by:
:formula_27
and
:formula_28.

If formula_29, then the formula_19 time constant equal to the sampling period. If formula_31, then formula_19 is significantly smaller than the sampling interval, and formula_33.

=== Algorithmic implementation ===
The filter recurrence relation provides a way to determine the output samples in terms of the input samples and the preceding output. The following pseudocode algorithm will simulate the effect of a high-pass filter on a series of digital samples, assuming equally spaced samples:

 // Return RC high-pass filter output samples, given input samples,
 // time interval &quot;dt&quot;, and time constant &quot;RC&quot;
 function highpass(&quot;real[1..n]&quot; x, &quot;real&quot; dt, &quot;real&quot; RC)
 var &quot;real[1..n]&quot; y
 var &quot;real&quot; α := RC / (RC + dt)
 y[1] := x[1]
 for i from 2 to n
 y[i] := α × y[i−1] + α × (x[i] − x[i−1])
 return y

The loop which calculates each of the formula_34 outputs can be refactored into the equivalent:

 for i from 2 to n
 y[i] := α × (y[i−1] + x[i] − x[i−1])

However, the earlier form shows how the parameter α changes the impact of the prior output and current &quot;change&quot; in input . In particular,
* A large α implies that the output will decay very slowly but will also be strongly influenced by even small changes in input. By the relationship between parameter α and time constant formula_19 above, a large α corresponds to a large formula_19 and therefore a low corner frequency of the filter. Hence, this case corresponds to a high-pass filter with a very narrow stopband. Because it is excited by small changes and tends to hold its prior output values for a long time, it can pass relatively low frequencies. However, a constant input (i.e., an input with ) will always decay to zero, as would be expected with a high-pass filter with a large formula_19.
* A small α implies that the output will decay quickly and will require large changes in the input (i.e., is large) to cause the output to change much. By the relationship between parameter α and time constant formula_19 above, a small α corresponds to a small formula_19 and therefore a high corner frequency of the filter. Hence, this case corresponds to a high-pass filter with a very wide stopband. Because it requires large (i.e., fast) changes and tends to quickly forget its prior output values, it can only pass relatively high frequencies, as would be expected with a high-pass filter with a small formula_19.

==Applications==
===Audio===
High-pass filters have many applications. They are used as part of an audio crossover to direct high frequencies to a tweeter while attenuating bass signals which could interfere with, or damage, the speaker. When such a filter is built into a loudspeaker cabinet it is normally a passive filter that also includes a low-pass filter for the woofer and so often employs both a capacitor and inductor (although very simple high-pass filters for tweeters can consist of a series capacitor and nothing else).
As an example, the formula above, applied to a tweeter with a resistance of 10 Ω, will determine the capacitor value for a cut-off frequency of 5 kHz.
formula_41, or approx 3.2 μF.

An alternative, which provides good quality sound without inductors (which are prone to parasitic coupling, are expensive, and may have significant internal resistance) is to employ bi-amplification with active RC filters or active digital filters with separate power amplifiers for each loudspeaker. Such low-current and low-voltage line level crossovers are called active crossovers.

Rumble filters are high-pass filters applied to the removal of unwanted sounds near to the lower end of the audible range or below. For example, noises (e.g., footsteps, or motor noises from record players and tape decks) may be removed because they are undesired or may overload the RIAA equalization circuit of the preamp.

High-pass filters are also used for AC coupling at the inputs of many audio power amplifiers, for preventing the amplification of DC currents which may harm the amplifier, rob the amplifier of headroom, and generate waste heat at the loudspeakers voice coil. One amplifier, the professional audio model DC300 made by Crown International beginning in the 1960s, did not have high-pass filtering at all, and could be used to amplify the DC signal of a common 9-volt battery at the input to supply 18 volts DC in an emergency for mixing console power. However, that model&#x27;s basic design has been superseded by newer designs such as the Crown Macro-Tech series developed in the late 1980s which included 10 Hz high-pass filtering on the inputs and switchable 35 Hz high-pass filtering on the outputs. Another example is the QSC Audio PLX amplifier series which includes an internal 5 Hz high-pass filter which is applied to the inputs whenever the optional 50 and 30 Hz high-pass filters are turned off.
Mixing consoles often include high-pass filtering at each channel strip. Some models have fixed-slope, fixed-frequency high-pass filters at 80 or 100 Hz that can be engaged; other models have sweepable high-pass filters, filters of fixed slope that can be set within a specified frequency range, such as from 20 to 400 Hz on the Midas Heritage 3000, or 20 to 20,000 Hz on the Yamaha M7CL digital mixing console. Veteran systems engineer and live sound mixer Bruce Main recommends that high-pass filters be engaged for most mixer input sources, except for those such as kick drum, bass guitar and piano, sources which will have useful low-frequency sounds. Main writes that DI unit inputs (as opposed to microphone inputs) do not need high-pass filtering as they are not subject to modulation by low-frequency stage wash—low frequency sounds coming from the subwoofers or the public address system and wrapping around to the stage. Main indicates that high-pass filters are commonly used for directional microphones which have a proximity effect—a low-frequency boost for very close sources. This low-frequency boost commonly causes problems up to 200 or 300 Hz, but Main notes that he has seen microphones that benefit from a 500 Hz high-pass filter setting on the console.

===Image===
High-pass and low-pass filters are also used in digital image processing to perform image modifications, enhancements, noise reduction, etc., using designs done in either the spatial domain or the frequency domain. The unsharp masking, or sharpening, operation used in image editing software is a high-boost filter, a generalization of high-pass.

<text>Arthur Henry &quot;Sarsfield&quot; Ward (15 February 1883 – 1 June 1959), better known as Sax Rohmer, was an English novelist. He is best remembered for his series of novels featuring the master criminal Fu Manchu.

== Life and work ==
Born in Birmingham to working class Irish parents William Ward (c. 1850–1932), a clerk, and Margaret Mary (née Furey; c. 1850–1901), Arthur Ward initially pursued a career as a civil servant before concentrating on writing full-time. He worked as a poet, songwriter and comedy sketch writer for music hall performers before creating the Sax Rohmer persona and pursuing a career writing fiction. 

Like his contemporaries Algernon Blackwood and Arthur Machen, Rohmer claimed membership to one of the factions of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Rohmer also claimed ties to the Rosicrucians, but the validity of his claims has been questioned. His doctor and family friend Dr R. Watson Councell may have been his only legitimate connection to such organisations. 

His first published work was issued in 1903, when the short story &quot;The Mysterious Mummy&quot; was sold to &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Rohmer&#x27;s main literary influences seem to have been Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle and M. P. Shiel. He gradually transitioned from writing for music hall performers to concentrating on short stories and serials for magazine publication. In 1909 he married Rose Elizabeth Knox.

He published his first book &quot;Pause!&quot; anonymously in 1910.

In 1934, Sax Rohmer moved into a newly refurbished house, Little Gatton in Gatton Road, Reigate, Surrey, where he lived until 1946.

He died after succumbing to Asian flu in 1959.

== The Fu Manchu series ==

After penning &quot;Little Tich&quot; in 1911 (as ghostwriter for the music hall entertainer of the same name) he wrote the first Fu Manchu novel, &quot;The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu&quot;, first published in a serialisation from October 1912 to June 1913. It was an immediate success, with its story of Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie facing the supposed worldwide conspiracy of the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;. The Fu Manchu stories, together with his more conventional detective series characters — Paul Harley, Gaston Max, Red Kerry, Morris Klaw (an occult detective), and the Crime Magnet — made Rohmer one of the most successful and financially well-off authors of the 1920s and 1930s.

Rohmer believed that conditions for launching a Chinese villain were ideal because the Boxer Rebellion had &quot;started off rumors of a Yellow Peril which had not yet died down. 

The first three Fu Manchu books were published in the four years between 1913 and 1917; but it was not until 1931 (some 14 years after the third book in the series) that Rohmer returned to the series with &quot;Daughter of Fu Manchu&quot;. The reason for the long interval was that Rohmer wanted to be rid of the series after &quot;The Si-Fan Mysteries&quot;. The first three books had been successfully filmed by Stoll in the twenties as a pair of serials. 

Rohmer&#x27;s first effort at reviving the Fu Manchu property was ultimately reworked as &quot;The Emperor of America&quot;. The original intent had been for the head of the organisation to be Fu Manchu&#x27;s daughter. He kept Head Centre as a female criminal mastermind to combat Drake Roscoe, but was very unhappy with the book both as it started and in its finished form. He would later return to Drake Roscoe and his female supervillain for the Sumuru series. In the meantime, he tried again to focus his energies on what was first titled &quot;Fu Manchu&#x27;s Daughter&quot; for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in 1930, but with an older (now knighted) Denis Nayland Smith as the protagonist once more. The results were infinitely better and jump-started the series in the process.

In the 28 years from 1931 to 1959, Rohmer added a further 10 books to the Fu Manchu series, meaning the series totals 13 books in all (not counting the posthumous short story collection &quot;The Wrath of Fu Manchu and Other Stories&quot;). The Fu Manchu series was criticised by the Chinese government and Chinese communities in the U.S. for what was perceived as negative ethnic stereotyping. Sociologist Virginia Berridge has stated that Rohmer created a false image of London&#x27;s Chinese community as crime-ridden, further claiming that the Limehouse Chinese were one of the most law-abiding of London&#x27;s ethnic minorities. Critic Jack Adrian has written: &quot;Rohmer&#x27;s own racism was careless and casual, a mere symptom of his times&quot;. Colin Watson commented: &quot;So vehement and repetitive were Sax Rohmer&#x27;s references to Asiatic plotting against &#x27;white&#x27; civilisation that they cannot be explained simply as the frills of melodramatic narration.&quot;

== Other work ==
Rohmer became a friend of escapologist Harry Houdini, who wrote to him in praise of Rohmer&#x27;s &quot;The Romance of Sorcery&quot;. Rohmer based his mystery-solving magician character Bazarada on Houdini.

&quot;The Orchard of Tears&quot; is an odd book in the context of Sax Rohmer&#x27;s other work. There are no Oriental villains or exotic locations; rather, there are gentle rabbits and lambs in pastoral settings and a great deal of philosophical musing. As much as he enjoyed Fu Manchu — and the notoriety and income the character provided — Rohmer had other interests and a markedly serious side. The departure from his expected subject matter is plainly signalled by the book&#x27;s dedication: &quot;To the slaves of the pomegranate, sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, who drink at the fountain of life, this chalice is offered as a loving-cup&quot;.

In &quot;The Quest of the Sacred Slipper&quot; (1919) terror comes to Britain when a self-centered archaeologist unearths one of Islam&#x27;s holiest relics—the sacred slipper of the prophet Mohammed. Until it is returned to its rightful people, the implacable Hassan of Aleppo vows his reign of death and destruction shall not cease. Behind these inhuman outrages is a secret group of fanatics. Not even the best men of Scotland Yard seem able to apprehend them. 

&quot;Tales of Chinatown&quot; (1922) is a collection of 10 short stories published in hardcover by Cassell in 1922 and Doubleday, Page and Company in 1922. All of the stories first appeared in magazine format. This collection includes a story that is considered to be one of his best and also has been anthologised many times; &quot;Tcheriapin&quot;. The story &quot;The Hand of the Mandarin Quong&quot; was rewritten for this book; first published as &quot;Hand of the White Sheikh&quot;, Rohmer changed the setting to a Chinatown background and published it as &quot;The Mystery of the Shriveled Hand&quot;; the title was then changed again for this collection.

Rohmer also wrote several novels of supernatural horror, including &quot;Brood of the Witch-Queen&quot;, described by Adrian as &quot;Rohmer&#x27;s masterpiece&quot;. Rohmer was very poor at managing his wealth, however, and made several disastrous business decisions that hampered him throughout his career.

His final success came with a 1946–1949 BBC Light Programme radio series that led to a series of 1950s novels featuring a female variation on Fu Manchu, Sumuru. The Sumuru series consists of five books. Two films featuring the character played by Shirley Eaton were also produced by Harry Alan Towers, as was a 2003 British-South African-German film, &quot;Sumuru&quot;.

Rohmer also wrote numerous short stories; &quot;The Master of Hollow Grange&quot; (1920) is a homage to M. R. James&#x27; story &quot;Lost Hearts&quot;, featuring a mad scientist who preys on children.

Rohmer&#x27;s work was banned in Nazi Germany, causing Rohmer to complain that he could not understand such censorship, stating &quot;my stories are not inimical to Nazi ideals&quot;.

After World War II, Rohmer and his wife moved to New York, only returning to London shortly before his death. He died in 1959 at the age of 76, due to an outbreak of &quot;Asian flu&quot;.

His wife, Rose Elizabeth (Knox) Ward (1886–1979), published her own mystery novel, &quot;Bianca in Black&quot;, in 1958 under the pen name Elizabeth Sax Rohmer. Some editions of the book mistakenly credit her as Rohmer&#x27;s daughter. She and Cay Van Ash (1918–1994), her husband&#x27;s former assistant, wrote a biography of the author, &quot;Master of Villainy: A Biography of Sax Rohmer&quot;, published in 1972.

<text>Bergen (, ), historically Bjørgvin, is a city and municipality in Vestland county on the west coast of Norway. , its population was roughly 289,330. Bergen is the second-largest city in Norway after the national capital Oslo. The municipality covers and is on the peninsula of Bergenshalvøyen. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on Byfjorden, &#x27;the city fjord&#x27;. The city is surrounded by mountains, causing Bergen to be called the &quot;city of seven mountains&quot;. Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the administrative centre of Vestland county. The city consists of eight boroughs: Arna, Bergenhus, Fana, Fyllingsdalen, Laksevåg, Ytrebygda, Årstad, and Åsane.

Trading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by King Olav Kyrre and was named Bjørgvin, &#x27;the green meadow among the mountains&#x27;. It served as Norway&#x27;s capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a bureau city of the Hanseatic League. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between Northern Norway and abroad, and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was overtaken by the capital, Christiania (now known as Oslo). What remains of the quays, Bryggen, is a World Heritage Site. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years. The Bergen School of Meteorology was developed at the Geophysical Institute starting in 1917, the Norwegian School of Economics was founded in 1936, and the University of Bergen in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own county. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county.

The city is an international centre for aquaculture, shipping, the offshore petroleum industry and subsea technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance. Bergen Port is Norway&#x27;s busiest in terms of both freight and passengers, with over 300 cruise ship calls a year bringing nearly half a million passengers to Bergen, a number that has doubled in 10 years. Almost half of the passengers are German or British. The city&#x27;s main football team is SK Brann and a unique tradition of the city is the buekorps, which are traditional marching neighbourhood youth organisations. Natives speak a distinct dialect, known as Bergensk. The city features Bergen Airport, Flesland and Bergen Light Rail, and is the terminus of the Bergen Line. Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities.

Bergen has a mild winter climate, though with significant precipitation. From December to March, Bergen can, in rare cases, be up to warmer than Oslo, even though both cities are at about 60° North. In summer however, Bergen is several degrees cooler than Oslo due to the same maritime effects. The Gulf Stream keeps the sea relatively warm, considering the latitude, and the mountains protect the city from cold winds from the north, north-east and east.

==History==


The city of Bergen was traditionally thought to have been founded by king Olav Kyrre, son of Harald Hardråde in 1070AD, four years after the Viking Age in England ended with the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Modern research has, however, discovered that a trading settlement had already been established in the 1020s or 1030s.

Bergen gradually assumed the function of capital of Norway in the early 13th century, as the first city where a rudimentary central administration was established. The city&#x27;s cathedral was the site of the first royal coronation in Norway in the 1150s, and continued to host royal coronations throughout the 13th century. Bergenhus fortress dates from the 1240s and guards the entrance to the harbour in Bergen. The functions of the capital city were lost to Oslo during the reign of King Haakon V (1299–1319).

In the middle of the 14th century, North German merchants, who had already been present in substantial numbers since the 13th century, founded one of the four &quot;&quot; of the Hanseatic League at Bryggen in Bergen. The principal export traded from Bergen was dried cod from the northern Norwegian coast, which started . The city was granted a monopoly for trade from the north of Norway by King Håkon Håkonsson (1217–1263). Stockfish was the main reason that the city became one of North Europe&#x27;s largest centres for trade. By the late 14th century, Bergen had established itself as the centre of the trade in Norway. The Hanseatic merchants lived in their own separate quarter of the town, where Middle Low German was used, enjoying exclusive rights to trade with the northern fishermen who each summer sailed to Bergen. The Hansa community resented Scottish merchants who settled in Bergen, and on 9 November 1523 several Scottish households were targeted by German residents. Today, Bergen&#x27;s old quayside, Bryggen, is on UNESCO&#x27;s list of World Heritage Sites. 

In 1349, the Black Death was brought to Norway by an English ship arriving in Bergen. Later outbreaks occurred in 1618, 1629 and 1637, on each occasion taking about 3,000 lives. In the 15th century, the city was attacked several times by the Victual Brothers, and in 1429 they succeeded in burning the royal castle and much of the city. In 1665, the city&#x27;s harbour was the site of the Battle of Vågen, when an English naval flotilla attacked a Dutch merchant and treasure fleet supported by the city&#x27;s garrison. Accidental fires sometimes got out of control, and one in 1702 reduced most of the town to ashes.

Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, Bergen remained one of the largest cities in Scandinavia, and it was Norway&#x27;s biggest city until the 1830s, being overtaken by the capital city of Oslo. From around 1600, the Hanseatic dominance of the city&#x27;s trade gradually declined in favour of Norwegian merchants (often of Hanseatic ancestry), and in the 1750s, the &#x27;, or major trading post of the Hanseatic League, finally closed. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Bergen was involved in the Atlantic slave trade. Bergen-based slave trader Jørgen Thormøhlen, the largest shipowner in Norway, was the main owner of the slave ship &quot;Cornelia&quot;, which made two slave-trading voyages in 1673 and 1674 respectively; he also developed the city&#x27;s industrial sector, particularly in the neighbourhood of Møhlenpris, which is named after him. Bergen retained its monopoly of trade with northern Norway until 1789. The Bergen stock exchange, the &#x27;, was established in 1813.

=== Modern history ===
Bergen was separated from Hordaland as a county of its own in 1831. It was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see ). The rural municipality of was merged with Bergen on 1 January 1877. The rural municipality of Årstad was merged with Bergen on 1 July 1915.

During World War II, Bergen was occupied on the first day of the German invasion on 9 April 1940, after a brief fight between German ships and the Norwegian coastal artillery. The Norwegian resistance movement groups in Bergen were Saborg, Milorg, &quot;&quot;, Sivorg, &#x27; and the Communist Party. On 20 April 1944, during the German occupation, the Dutch cargo ship &#x27; anchored off the Bergenhus Fortress, loaded with over 120 tons of explosives, and blew up, killing at least 150 people and damaging historic buildings. The city was subject to some Allied bombing raids, aimed at German naval installations in the harbour. Some of these caused Norwegian civilian casualties numbering about 100.

Bergen is also well known in Norway for the Isdal Woman (), an unidentified person who was found dead at Isdalen (&quot;Ice Valley&quot;) on 29 November 1970. The unsolved case encouraged international speculation over the years and it remains one of the most profound mysteries in recent Norwegian history.

The rural municipalities of Arna, Fana, Laksevåg, and Åsane were merged with Bergen on 1 January 1972. The city lost its status as a separate county on the same date, and Bergen is now a municipality, in the county of Vestland.

===Fires===
The city&#x27;s history is marked by numerous great fires. In 1198, the faction set fire to the city in connection with a battle against the faction during the civil war. In 1248, and burned, and 11 churches were destroyed. In 1413 another fire struck the city, and 14 churches were destroyed. In 1428 the city was plundered by the Victual Brothers, and in 1455, Hanseatic merchants were responsible for burning down Munkeliv Abbey. In 1476, burned down in a fire started by a drunk trader. In 1582, another fire hit the city centre and . In 1675, 105 buildings burned down in . In 1686 another great fire hit , destroying 231 city blocks and 218 boathouses. The greatest fire in history was in 1702, when 90% of the city was burned to ashes. In 1751, there was a great fire at . In 1756, yet another fire at burned down 1,500 buildings, and further great fires hit in 1771 and 1901. In 1916, 300 buildings burned down in the city centre including the Swan pharmacy, the oldest pharmacy in Norway, and in 1955 parts of burned down.

===Toponymy===
Bergen is pronounced in English or and in Norwegian (in the local dialect ). The Old Norse forms of the name were and (and in Icelandic and Faroese the city is still called ). The first element is (n.) or (n.), which translates as &#x27;mountain(s)&#x27;. The last element is (f.), which means a new settlement where there used to be a pasture or meadow. Bergen is often called &quot;the city among the seven mountains&quot;. The playwright Ludvig Holberg, inspired by the seven hills of Rome, decided that his home town must be blessed with a corresponding seven mountains, though locals debate which seven they are.

In 1918, there was a campaign to reintroduce the Norse form &#x27; as the name of the city. This was turned down – but as a compromise, the name of the diocese was changed to &#x27;.

==Geography==

Bergen occupies most of the peninsula of Bergenshalvøyen in the district of Midthordland in mid-western Hordaland. The municipality covers an area of . Most of the urban area is on or close to a fjord or bay, although the urban area has several mountains. The city centre is surrounded by the Seven Mountains, although there is disagreement as to which of the nine mountains constitute these. Ulriken, Fløyen, Løvstakken and Damsgårdsfjellet are always included as well as three of Lyderhorn, Sandviksfjellet, Blåmanen, Rundemanen and Kolbeinsvarden. Gullfjellet is Bergen&#x27;s highest mountain, at above mean sea level. Bergen is far enough north that during clear nights at the solstice, there is borderline civil daylight in spite of the sun having set.

Bergen is sheltered from the North Sea by the islands Askøy, Holsnøy (the municipality of Meland) and Sotra (the municipalities of Fjell and Sund). Bergen borders the municipalities Alver and Osterøy to the north, Vaksdal and Samnanger to the east, Os (Bjørnafjorden) and Austevoll to the south, and Øygarden and Askøy to the west.

==Climate==

Bergen has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Dolk&quot;), with mild summers and cool winters. Rainfall is plentiful in all seasons, along with intermittent snowfall during winter, which often melts quickly. The exceptionally plentiful precipitation that defines the city is caused by orographic lift, sometimes causing more than two months of consecutive rainy days. The city is therefore considered the rainiest city in Europe, although it is not the wettest &quot;place&quot; on the continent.

Bergen&#x27;s weather is much warmer than the city&#x27;s latitude (60.4° N) might suggest. Temperatures below −10 °C (14 °F) are rare. Summer temperatures sometimes reach the upper 20s, although temperatures over 30°C were previously only seen a few days each decade. The growing season in Bergen is exceptionally long for its latitude, more than 200 days. Its mild winters and proximity to the Gulf Stream provide the city with a plant hardiness zone of 8b and 9a depending on location; this zone is much more common below 50°N even in Europe, with cities as far south as Bordeaux, Thessaloniki and Istanbul falling into this category. The average date for the last overnight freeze (low below ) in spring is April 4 and average date for first freeze in autumn is November 7 giving a frost-free season of 216 days.

Extreme temperatures are also quite rare in the city. The highest temperature ever recorded was on 26 July 2019, beating the previous record from 2018 at degrees, and the lowest was in January 1987.

The city is quite cloudy year round, although old sunshine hours data might have caused an underestimate of sunshine hours, due to the city&#x27;s mountainside location. A new sun recorder was established at Bergen Airport, Flesland (a location with less terrain obscuring the sun) in December 2015, and this recorded an average of 1,596 hours of sun annually during 2016–2022.

==Demographics==
, the municipality had a population of 286,930, making the population density 599 people per km2. Urban areas outside the city limits, as defined by Statistics Norway, consist of Indre Arna (6,536 residents on 1 January 2012), Fanahammeren (3,690), Ytre Arna (2,626), Hylkje (2,277) and Espeland (2,182).

As of 2007, people of Norwegian origin (those who have two parents born in Norway) make up 84.5% of Bergen&#x27;s residents. In addition, 8.1% were first or second generation immigrants of Western background and 7.4% were first or second generation immigrants of non-Western background. The population grew by 4,549 people in 2009, a growth rate of 1.8%. Ninety-six percent of the population lives in urban areas. As of 2002, the average gross income for men above the age of 17 is 426,000 Norwegian krone (NOK), the average gross income for women above the age of 17 is NOK238,000, with the total average gross income being NOK330,000. In 2007, there were 104.6 men for every 100 women in the age group of 20–39. 22.8% of the population were under 17years of age, while 4.5% were 80 and above.

The immigrant population (those with two foreign-born parents) in Bergen, includes 42,169 individuals with backgrounds from more than 200 countries representing 15.5% of the city&#x27;s population (2014). Of these, 50.2% have background from Europe, 28.9% from Asia, 13.1% from Africa, 5.5% from Latin America, 1.9% from North America, and 0.4% from Oceania. The immigrant population in Bergen in the period 1993–2008 increased by 119.7%, while the ethnic Norwegian population grew by 8.1% during the same period. The national average is 138.0% and 4.2%. The immigrant population has thus accounted for 43.6% of Bergen&#x27;s population growth and 60.8% of Norway&#x27;s population growth during the period 1993–2008, compared with 84.5% in Oslo.

The immigrant population in Bergen has changed a lot since 1970. As of 1 January 1986, there were 2,870 people with a non-Western immigrant background in Bergen. In 2006, this figure had increased to 14,630, so the non-Western immigrant population in Bergen was five times higher than in 1986. This is a slightly slower growth than the national average, which has sextupled during the same period. Also in relation to the total population in Bergen, the proportion of non-Westerns increased significantly. In 1986, the proportion of the total population in the municipality of non-Western background was 3.6%. In January 2006, people with a non-Western immigrant background accounted for 6 percent of the population in Bergen. The share of Western immigrants has remained stable at around 2% in the period. The number of Poles in Bergen rose from 697 in 2006 to 3,128 in 2010.

As of 2022, immigrants of non-Western origin and their children enumerated 30,540, and made up an estimated 11% of Bergen&#x27;s population. Immigrants of Western origin and their children enumerated 22,954, and made up an estimated 9% of Bergen&#x27;s population.

The Church of Norway is the largest denomination in Bergen, with 201,006 (79.74%) registered adherents in 2012. Bergen is the seat of the Diocese of Bjørgvin with Bergen Cathedral as its centrepiece, while St John&#x27;s Church is the city&#x27;s most prominent. As of 2012, the state church is followed by 52,059 irreligious, 4,947 members of various Protestant free churches, 3,873 actively registered Catholics, 2,707 registered Muslims, 816 registered Hindus, 255 registered Russian Orthodox and 147 registered Oriental Orthodox.

==Cityscape==

The city centre of Bergen lies in the west of the municipality, facing the fjord of Byfjorden. It is among a group of mountains known as the Seven Mountains, although the number is a matter of definition. From here, the urban area of Bergen extends to the north, west and south, and to its east is a large mountain massif. Outside the city centre and the surrounding neighbourhoods (i.e. Årstad, inner Laksevåg and Sandviken), the majority of the population lives in relatively sparsely populated residential areas built after 1950. While some are dominated by apartment buildings and modern terraced houses (e.g. Fyllingsdalen), others are dominated by single-family homes.
The oldest part of Bergen is the area around the bay of Vågen in the city centre. Originally centred on the bay&#x27;s eastern side, Bergen eventually expanded west and southwards. Few buildings from the oldest period remain, the most significant being St Mary&#x27;s Church from the 12th century. For several hundred years, the extent of the city remained almost constant. The population was stagnant, and the city limits were narrow. In 1702, seven-eighths of the city burned. Most of the old buildings of Bergen, including Bryggen (which was rebuilt in a mediaeval style), were built after the fire. The fire marked a transition from tar covered houses, as well as the remaining log houses, to painted and some brick-covered wooden buildings.
The last half of the 19th century saw a period of rapid expansion and modernisation. The fire of 1855 west of Torgallmenningen led to the development of regularly sized city blocks in this area of the city centre. The city limits were expanded in 1876, and Nygård, Møhlenpris and Sandviken were urbanized with large-scale construction of city blocks housing both the poor and the wealthy. Their architecture is influenced by a variety of styles; historicism, classicism and Art Nouveau. The wealthy built villas between Møhlenpris and Nygård, and on the side of Mount Fløyen; these areas were also added to Bergen in 1876. Simultaneously, an urbanization process was taking place in Solheimsviken in Årstad, at that time outside the Bergen municipality, centred on the large industrial activity in the area. The workers&#x27; homes in this area were poorly built, and little remains after large-scale redevelopment in the 1960s–1980s.
After Årstad became a part of Bergen in 1916, a development plan was applied to the new area. Few city blocks akin to those in Nygård and Møhlenpris were planned. Many of the worker class built their own homes, and many small, detached apartment buildings were built. After World War II, Bergen had again run short of land to build on, and, contrary to the original plans, many large apartment buildings were built in Landås in the 1950s and 1960s. Bergen acquired Fyllingsdalen from Fana municipality in 1955. Like similar areas in Oslo (e.g. Lambertseter), Fyllingsdalen was developed into a modern suburb with large apartment buildings, mid-rises, and some single-family homes, in the 1960s and 1970s. Similar developments took place beyond Bergen&#x27;s city limits, for example in Loddefjord. 

At the same time as planned city expansion took place inside Bergen, its extra-municipal suburbs also grew rapidly. Wealthy citizens of Bergen had been living in Fana since the 19th century, but as the city expanded it became more convenient to settle in the municipality. Similar processes took place in Åsane and Laksevåg. Most of the homes in these areas are detached row houses, single family homes or small apartment buildings. After the surrounding municipalities were merged with Bergen in 1972, expansion has continued in largely the same manner, although the municipality encourages condensing near commercial centres, future Bergen Light Rail stations, and elsewhere.

As part of the modernisation wave of the 1950s and 1960s, and due to damage caused by World War II, the city government ambitiously planned redevelopment of many areas in central Bergen. The plans involved demolition of several neighbourhoods of wooden houses, namely Nordnes, Marken, and Stølen. None of the plans was carried out in its original form; the Marken and Stølen redevelopment plans were discarded and that of Nordnes only carried out in the area that had been most damaged by war. The city council of Bergen had in 1964 voted to demolish the entirety of Marken, however, the decision proved to be highly controversial and the decision was reversed in 1974. Bryggen was under threat of being wholly or partly demolished after the fire of 1955, when a large number of the buildings burned to the ground. Instead of being demolished, the remaining buildings were restored and accompanied by reconstructions of some of the burned buildings.

Demolition of old buildings and occasionally whole city blocks is still taking place, the most recent major example being the 2007 razing of Jonsvollskvartalet at Nøstet.

Billboards are banned in the city.

==Administration==

The municipality has had a parliamentary government since 2000. Up until then, Bergen had been governed by the city council (). The government now consists of seven government members called commissioners, and is appointed by the city council, the supreme authority of the city.

The tables below show the current and historical composition of the council by political party. 











===Boroughs===

Bergen is divided into eight boroughs, as seen on the map to the right. Clockwise, starting with the northernmost, the boroughs are Åsane, Arna, Fana, Ytrebygda, Fyllingsdalen, Laksevåg, Årstad and Bergenhus. The city centre is in Bergenhus. Parts of Fana, Ytrebygda, Åsane and Arna are not part of the Bergen urban area, explaining why the municipality has approximately 20,000 more inhabitants than the urban area.

Local borough administrations have varied since Bergen&#x27;s expansion in 1972. From 1974, each borough had a politically chosen administration. From 1989, Bergen was divided into 12 health and social districts, each locally administered. From 2000 to 2004, the former organizational form with eight politically chosen local administrations was again in use and from 2008 through to 2010, a similar form existed where the local administrations had less power than previously.


(Pertaining to the table above: The acreage figures include fresh water and uninhabited mountain areas, except: 
1 1 The borough Bergenhus is , the rest is water and uninhabited mountain areas.
2 2 The borough Årstad is , the rest is water and uninhabited mountain areas.)

Former borough: Sentrum
Sentrum (literally, &quot;Centre&quot;) was a borough (with the same name as a present-day neighbourhood). The borough was numbered &quot;01&quot;, and its perimeter was from Store Lungegårdsvann and Strømmen along Puddefjorden around Nordnes and over to Skuteviken, up Mt. Fløyen east of Langelivannet, on to Skansemyren and over Forskjønnelsen to Store Lungegårdsvann, south of the railroad tracks.

The population of the (now defunct) borough, numbered in 1994 more than 18,000 people.

==Education==
There are 64 elementary schools, 18 lower secondary schools and 20 upper secondary schools in Bergen, as well as 11 combined elementary and lower secondary schools. Bergen Cathedral School is the oldest school in Bergen and was founded by Pope Adrian IV in 1153.

The &quot;Bergen School of Meteorology&quot; was developed at the Geophysical Institute beginning in 1917, the Norwegian School of Economics was founded in 1936, and the University of Bergen in 1946.

The University of Bergen has 16,000 students and 3,000 staff, making it the third-largest educational institution in Norway. Research in Bergen dates back to activity at Bergen Museum in 1825, although the university was not founded until 1946. The university has a broad range of courses and research in academic fields and three national centres of excellence, in climate research, petroleum research and medieval studies. The main campus is in the city centre. The university co-operates with Haukeland University Hospital within medical research. The Chr. Michelsen Institute is an independent research foundation established in 1930 focusing on human rights and development issues.

The Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, which has its main campus in Kronstad, has 16,000 students and 1800 staff. It focuses on professional education, such as teaching, healthcare and engineering. The college was created through amalgamation in 1994; campuses are spread around town but will be co-located at Kronstad. The Norwegian School of Economics is in outer Sandviken and is the leading business school in Norway, having produced three Economy Nobel Prize laureates. The school has more than 3,000 students and approximately 400 staff. Other tertiary education institutions include the Bergen School of Architecture, the Bergen National Academy of the Arts, in the city centre with 300 students, and the Norwegian Naval Academy in Laksevåg. The Norwegian Institute of Marine Research has been in Bergen since 1900. It provides research and advice relating to ecosystems and aquaculture. It has a staff of 700 people.

==Economy==

In August 2004, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named the city one of Europe&#x27;s 14 &quot;secret capitals&quot; where Bergen&#x27;s capital reign is acknowledged within maritime businesses and activities such as aquaculture and marine research, with the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) (the second-largest oceanography research centre in Europe) as a leading institution. Some of the world&#x27;s largest aquaculture companies, such as Mowi and Lerøy are headquartered in the city. Shipowners based in Bergen control a significant portion of the Norwegian merchant fleet, including shipowners such as Wilson, Odfjell and Gearbulk. The city has a large presence of financial institutions. Banks Sbanken and Sparebanken Vest are headquartered in the city. The Norwegian branches of insurance companies Tryg, DNB Livsforsikring and Nordea Liv are headquartered in Bergen, along with a significant presence of marine insurance companies, including Norwegian Hull Club. A number of banks maintain large corporate banking divisions in connection with shipping and aquaculture in the city.

Bergen is the main base for the Royal Norwegian Navy (at Haakonsvern) and its international airport Flesland is the main heliport for the Norwegian North Sea oil and gas industry, from where thousands of offshore workers commute to their work places onboard oil and gas rigs and platforms.

Tourism is an important income source for the city. The hotels in the city may be full at times, due to the increasing number of tourists and conferences. Bergen is recognized as the unofficial capital of the region known as Western Norway, and recognized and marketed as the gateway city to the world-famous fjords of Norway, and for that reason, it has become Norway&#x27;s largest – and one of Europe&#x27;s largest – cruise ship ports of call.

==Transport==

Bergen Port, operated by Bergen Port Authority, is the largest seaport in Norway.
In 2011, the port saw 264 cruise calls with 350,248 visitors, In 2009, the port handled 56million tonnes of cargo, making it the ninth-busiest cargo port in Europe. There are plans to move the port out of the city centre, but no location has been chosen. Fjord Line operates a cruiseferry service to Hirtshals, Denmark. Bergen is the southern terminus of Hurtigruten, the Coastal Express, which operates with daily services along the coast to Kirkenes.

Bergen connects to the island of Bjorøy via the subsea Bjorøy Tunnel.

Bergen Station is the terminus of the Bergen Line, which runs to Oslo. Vy operates express trains to Oslo and the Bergen Commuter Rail to Voss. Between Bergen and Arna Station, the train runs about every 30minutes through the Ulriken Tunnel; there is no corresponding road tunnel, forcing road vehicles to travel via Åsane or Nesttun.
Bergen is one of the smallest cities in Europe to have both tram and trolleybus electric urban transport systems simultaneously . Public transport in Hordaland is managed by Skyss, which operates an extensive city bus network in Bergen and to many neighbouring municipalities, including one route which operates as a trolleybus. The trolleybus system in Bergen is the only one still in operation in Norway and one of two trolleybus systems in Scandinavia.

The modern tram Bergen Light Rail () opened between the city centre and Nesttun in 2010, extended to Rådal (Lagunen Storsenter) in 2013 and to the Bergen airport Flesland in 2017. Extensions to other boroughs may occur later. Fløibanen is a funicular which runs from the city centre to Mount Fløyen and Ulriksbanen is an aerial tramway which runs to Mount Ulriken.

Bergensk is the native dialect of Bergen. It was strongly influenced by Low German-speaking merchants from the mid-14th to mid-18th centuries. During the Dano-Norwegian period from 1536 to 1814, Bergen was more influenced by Danish than other areas of Norway. The Danish influence removed the female grammatical gender in the 16th century, making Bergensk one of very few Norwegian dialects with only two instead of three grammatical genders. The Rs are uvular trills, as in French, which probably spread to Bergen some time in the 18th century, overtaking the alveolar trill in the time span of two to three generations. Owing to an improved literacy rate, Bergensk was influenced by riksmål and bokmål in the 19th and 20th centuries. This led to large parts of the German-inspired vocabulary disappearing and pronunciations shifting slightly towards East Norwegian.

The 1986 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest took place in Bergen. Bergen was the host city for the 2017 UCI Road World Championships. The city is also a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of gastronomy since 2015.

===Music===

Bergen has been the home of several notable alternative bands, collectively referred to as the Bergen Wave. These bands include Röyksopp and Kings of Convenience on the small, Bergen-based record label Tellé Records, as well as related side-projects, such as The Whitest Boy Alive, Kommode, and Visekongene on independent labels. Other internationally well-received artists also originating from Bergen include Aurora, Sondre Lerche, Kygo, Boy Pablo and Alan Walker.

Bergen is also known as the &quot;black metal capital of Norway&quot;, due to its role in the early Norwegian black metal scene and the amount of acts to come from the city in the early 1990s. Also the singer Einar Selvik of the band Wardruna was born in Bergen and became famous thanks to the TV series &quot;Vikings&quot;.

Bergen is also the birthplace of composer Edvard Grieg. The biggest music festival in the city is Bergenfest.

===Street art===
Bergen is considered to be the street art capital of Norway. Famed artist Banksy visited the city in 2000 and inspired many to start creating street art. Soon after, the city brought up the most famous street artist in Norway: Dolk. His art can still be seen in several places in the city, and in 2009 the city council choose to preserve Dolk&#x27;s work &quot;Spray&quot; with protective glass. In 2011, Bergen council launched a plan of action for street art in Bergen from 2011 to 2015 to ensure that &quot;Bergen will lead the fashion for street art as an expression both in Norway and Scandinavia&quot;.

The Madam Felle (1831–1908) monument in Sandviken, is in honour of a Norwegian woman of German origin, who in the mid-19th century managed, against the will of the council, to maintain a counter of beer. A well-known restaurant of the same name is now elsewhere in Bergen. The monument was erected in 1990 by sculptor Kari Rolfsen, supported by an anonymous donor. Madam Felle, civil name Oline Fell, was posthumously remembered in a popular song, possibly originally a folksong, &quot;Kjenner Dokker Madam Felle?&quot; by Lothar Lindtner and Rolf Berntzen on an album in 1977.

==International relations==
Each year Bergen sells the Christmas tree seen in Newcastle&#x27;s Haymarket as a sign of the ongoing friendship between the sister cities, which were connected by a ferry service from 1890 to 2008. The Nordic friendship cities of Bergen, Gothenburg, Turku and Aarhus arrange inter-Nordic camps each year by registering tenth-grade school classes from each of the other cities to school camps, for a profit. Bergen received a totem pole as a gift of friendship from the city of Seattle on the city&#x27;s 900th anniversary in 1970. It is now placed in the Nordnes Park and gazes out over the sea towards the friendship city far to the west.
