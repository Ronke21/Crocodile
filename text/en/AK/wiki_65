<text>The Morrill Land-Grant Acts are United States statutes that allowed for the creation of land-grant colleges in U.S. states using the proceeds from sales of federally owned land, often obtained from Native American tribes through treaty, cession, or seizure. The Morrill Act of 1862 (12 Stat. 503 (1862) later codified as et seq.) was enacted during the American Civil War, and the Morrill Act of 1890 (the Agricultural College Act of 1890 (, later codified as et seq.)) expanded this model.

==Passage of original bill==
Beginning in the 1830s, a political movement called for the creation of agriculture colleges. The movement was led by Professor Jonathan Baldwin Turner of Illinois College. For example, the Michigan Constitution of 1850 called for the creation of an &quot;agricultural school&quot;, though it was not until February 12, 1855, that Michigan governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed a bill establishing the United States&#x27; first agriculture college, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, known today as Michigan State University, which served as a model for the Morrill Act.

On February 8, 1853, the Illinois Legislature adopted a resolution, drafted by Turner, calling for the Illinois congressional delegation to work to enact a land-grant bill to fund a system of industrial colleges, one in each state. Senator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois believed it was advisable that the bill should be introduced by an eastern congressman, and two months later Representative Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont introduced his bill.

Unlike the Turner Plan, which provided an equal grant to each state, the Morrill bill allocated land based on the number of senators and representatives each state had in Congress. This was more advantageous to the more populous eastern states.

The Morrill Act was first proposed in 1857, and was passed by Congress in 1859, but it was vetoed by President James Buchanan. In 1861, Morrill resubmitted the act with the amendment that the proposed institutions would teach military tactics as well as engineering and agriculture. Aided by the secession of many states that did not support the plans, the reconfigured Morrill Act was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on July 2, 1862.

==Land-grant colleges==


The purpose of the land-grant colleges was:
without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactic, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the legislatures of the States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.

From the early to mid-19th century the federal government, through 162 violence-backed cessions, expropriated approximately 10.7 million acres of land from 245 tribal nations and divided it into roughly 80,000 parcels for redistribution. Under the act, each eligible state received of federal land, either within or contiguous to its boundaries, for each member of congress the state had as of the census of 1860. This land, or the proceeds from its sale, was to be used toward establishing and funding the educational institutions described above. Under provision six of the Act, &quot;No State while in a condition of rebellion or insurrection against the government of the United States shall be entitled to the benefit of this act,&quot; in reference to the recent secession of several Southern states and the contemporaneously raging American Civil War. However, after the war, in the 1870s, Mississippi, Virginia, and South Carolina each assigned one African American college land grant status; these were, respectively, Alcorn University, Hampton Institute, and Claflin University.

In 1890 the 1862 Act was extended to the former Confederate states (see below for more detailed information), and it was eventually extended to every state and territory, including those created after 1862. If the federal land within a state was insufficient to meet that state&#x27;s land grant, the state was issued scrip which authorized the state to select federal lands in other states to fund its institution. For example, New York carefully selected valuable timber land in Wisconsin to fund Cornell University. The resulting management of this scrip by the university yielded one third of the total grant revenues generated by all the states, even though New York received only one-tenth of the 1862 land grant. Overall, the 1862 Morrill Act allocated of land, which when sold yielded a collective endowment of $7.55 million.

On September 12, 1862, the state of Iowa was the first to accept the terms of the Morrill Act which provided the funding boost needed for the fledgling State Agricultural College and Model Farm (eventually renamed Iowa State University of Science and Technology). The first land-grant institution actually created under the Act was Kansas State University, which was established on February 16, 1863, and opened on September 2, 1863.

The land grant colleges transformed engineering education in America and boosted the United States into a position of leader in technical education. Before the Civil War, American colleges primarily trained students in classical studies and the liberal arts. For the most part, only the relatively affluent could afford higher education, and entrance requirements often required proficiency in the dead languages of Latin and Ancient Greek. The first Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees, which typically required no Latin, came into being around 1850. American engineers were mostly educated at the United States Military Academy, on fortress construction, and their instructors were the authors of most engineering texts of the day. The Morrill Act changed all of that. Though the Congressional debates about the Act were largely focused on benefits to agriculture, the mechanic arts were specifically included in the Act&#x27;s language, meaning applied sciences and engineering. The Act prohibited spending the endowment on constructing buildings as expensive and unnecessary, so instead the tools for engineering education increased, such as textbooks, laboratories and equipment. The number of engineers skyrocketed. Whereas in 1866 there were around 300 American men who had graduated with engineering degrees and only six reputable colleges granting them, just four years later there were 21 colleges offering engineering degrees and the total number of engineers graduated had tripled to 866. The following decade added another 2,249 engineers, and by 1911 the United States was graduating 3,000 engineers a year, with a total of 38,000 in the work force. At the time, Germany was graduating 1,800 engineers per year. The US had become the leader in technical education just 50 years after passage of the Morrill Act.

With a few exceptions (including Cornell University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), nearly all of the land-grant colleges are public. (Cornell University, while private, administers several state-supported statutory colleges that fulfill its public land-grant mission to the state of New York.)

To maintain their status as land-grant colleges, a number of programs are required to be maintained by the college. These include programs in agriculture and engineering, as well as a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program.

==Expansion==
The second Morrill Act (1890) was also aimed at the former Confederate states. This act required each state to show that race was not an admissions criterion, or else to designate a separate land-grant institution for African Americans. Thus, the second Morrill Act facilitated segregated education, although it also provided higher educational opportunities for African Americans who otherwise would not have had them. Among the seventy colleges and universities which eventually evolved from the Morrill Acts are several of today&#x27;s historically Black colleges and universities. Though the 1890 Act granted cash instead of land, it granted colleges under that act the same legal standing as the 1862 Act colleges; hence the term &quot;land-grant college&quot; properly applies to both groups.

Later on, other colleges such as the University of the District of Columbia and the &quot;1994 land-grant colleges&quot; for Native Americans were also awarded cash by Congress in lieu of land to achieve &quot;land-grant&quot; status.

In imitation of the land-grant colleges&#x27; focus on agricultural and mechanical research, Congress later established programs of sea grant colleges (aquatic research, in 1966), urban grant colleges (urban research, in 1985), space grant colleges (space research, in 1988), and sun grant colleges (sustainable energy research, in 2003).

==Agricultural experiment stations and cooperative extension service==
Starting in 1887, Congress also funded agricultural experiment stations and various categories of agricultural and veterinary research &quot;under direction of&quot; the land-grant universities. Congress later recognized the need to disseminate the knowledge gained at the land-grant colleges to farmers and homemakers. The Smith–Lever Act of 1914 started federal funding of cooperative extension, with the land-grant universities&#x27; agents being sent to virtually every county of every state. In some states, the annual federal appropriations to the land-grant college under these laws exceed the current income from the investment of the sales proceeds of the original land grants. In the fiscal year 2006 USDA budget, $1.033 billion went to research and cooperative extension activities nationwide. For this purpose, then President George W. Bush proposed a $1.035 billion appropriation for fiscal year 2008.

<doc id="55595" wikidata="Q4017633" url="?curid=55595" title="Wade–Davis Bill">
<text>The Wade–Davis Bill of 1864 () was a bill &quot;to guarantee to certain States whose governments have been usurped or overthrown a republican form of government,&quot; proposed for the Reconstruction of the South. In opposition to President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s more lenient ten percent plan, the bill made re-admittance to the Union for former Confederate states contingent on a majority in each ex-Confederate state to take the Ironclad Oath to the effect they had never in the past supported the Confederacy. The bill passed both houses of Congress on July 2, 1864, but was pocket vetoed by Lincoln and never took effect. The Radical Republicans were outraged that Lincoln did not sign the bill. Lincoln wanted to mend the Union by carrying out the ten percent plan. He believed it would be too difficult to repair all of the ties within the Union if the Wade–Davis bill passed.

==Background==
The Wade–Davis Bill emerged from a plan introduced in the Senate by Ira Harris of New York in February, 1863.

It was written by two Radical Republicans, Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio and Representative Henry Winter Davis of Maryland, and proposed to base the Reconstruction of the South on the federal government&#x27;s power to guarantee a republican form of government. The Bill was also important for national and congressional power. Although federally imposed conditions of reconstruction retrospectively seem logical, there was a widespread belief that southern Unionism would return the seceded states to the Union after the Confederacy&#x27;s military power was broken. This belief was not fully abandoned until later in 1863. The provisions, critics complained, were virtually impossible to meet, thus making it likely there would be permanent national control over the states formerly in rebellion.

== Legislative history ==

=== House of Representatives ===
The bill was formally introduced February 15, 1864, as . The final vote of the house was 73–59.

=== Senate voting ===
==Lincoln&#x27;s veto==
One of Lincoln&#x27;s objections was to the idea that seceded states needed to &quot;re-join&quot; the Union (an idea that permeated the whole bill). From Lincoln&#x27;s point of view, states were not constitutionally allowed to secede in the first place, so the ordinances of secession were null and void from the moment they passed. Thus the war was being fought to &quot;compel the obedience of rebellious individuals,” not of rebellious states per se. The language of the bill undermined this argument, as the possibility of Confederate states being “readmitted” implied those states in rebellion were not part of the Union anymore. Moreover, the bill compelled those states to draft new Constitutions banning slavery, which was arguably unconstitutional at the time (as Congress had no power to deal with slavery within individual states).

On a more pragmatic level, Lincoln also feared the bill would sabotage his own reconstruction activities in states like Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee, all of which had passed ordinances of secession but were under Federal occupation and controlled by pro-Union governments. He believed that Wade–Davis would jeopardize state-level emancipation movements in loyal border states like Missouri and, especially, Maryland. The bill threatened to destroy the delicate political coalitions which Lincoln had begun to construct between Northern and Southern moderates. More broadly, it underscored how differently Lincoln and Radical Republicans viewed Confederates: Lincoln believed they could be coaxed back into peaceful coexistence, while Radical Republicans believed the Confederates were traitors and therefore could not be trusted. Lincoln ended up killing the bill with a pocket veto, and it was not resurrected.

==The aftermath==

Davis was a bitter enemy of Lincoln because he believed that the President was too lenient in his policies for the South. Davis and Wade issued a manifesto &quot;To the Supporters of the Government&quot; on August 4, 1864, accusing Lincoln of using reconstruction to secure electors in the South who would &quot;be at the dictation of his personal ambition,&quot; and condemning what they saw as his efforts to usurp power from Congress (&quot;the authority of Congress is &quot;paramount&quot; and must be respected&quot;). The Manifesto backfired, however, and while it initially caused much debate on the nature of the Reconstruction to come, Winter Davis was not renominated for his Congressional seat in Maryland. Its ideas, particularly that Congress should be the main driver of the post-war process and that the Presidency should be a weaker office (the President &quot;must confine himself to his executive duties – &quot;to obey and execute&quot;, not to make the laws –, to suppress by arms armed rebellion, and leave political reorganization to Congress&quot;), did influence Congressional Republicans during the following years, however, eventually leading to Andrew Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial.

Lincoln survived their attacks and greatly strengthened his position with a landslide victory in the 1864 election, and national passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in February, 1865. He momentarily marginalized the Radicals in terms of shaping Reconstruction policy. After Lincoln&#x27;s death, Radical Republicans battled President Andrew Johnson, who tried to implement a version of Lincoln&#x27;s plan. The midterm elections of 1866 turned into a referendum on the Fourteenth amendment and the trajectory of Reconstruction policy. With the Republicans&#x27; victory, Congress took control of Reconstruction. The radicals wanted a much harsher plan, but they did not try to reimpose the terms of Wade-Davis. Instead they implemented the Reconstruction Acts and took control of the former rebel states with the United States Army, which registered black men as voters and barred some former Confederate leaders from running for office.

<text>The National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864 were two United States federal banking acts that established a system of national banks chartered at the federal level, and created the United States National Banking System. They encouraged development of a national currency backed by bank holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and established the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as part of the United States Department of the Treasury. The Act shaped today&#x27;s national banking system and its support of a uniform U.S. banking policy.

==Background==
===Antebellum Period===
At the end of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836, the control of banking regimes devolved mostly to the states. Different states adopted policies including a total ban on banking (as in Wisconsin), a single state-chartered bank (as in Indiana and Illinois), limited chartering of banks (as in Ohio), and free entry (as in New York). While the relative success of New York&#x27;s &quot;free banking&quot; laws led several states also to adopt a free-entry banking regime, the system remained poorly integrated across state lines. Though all banknotes were uniformly denominated in dollars, notes would often circulate at a steep discount in states beyond their issue.

In the end, well-publicized frauds arose in states like Michigan, which had adopted free entry regimes but did not require the redeemability of bank issues for specie. The perception of dangerous &quot;wildcat banking”, along with the poor integration of the U.S. banking system, led to increasing public support for a uniform national banking regime.

The United States government, on the other hand, still had limited taxation capabilities and so had an interest in the seigniorage potential of a national bank. In 1846, the Polk Administration created a United States Treasury system that moved public funds from private banks to Treasury branches to fund the Mexican–American War. However, the revenue generated this way was limited without a national currency.

===Civil War===
This became more urgent during the Civil War, when Congress and Lincoln were struggling to finance the war efforts. Without a national mechanism for issuing currency, the Lincoln administration could not exploit the powers and loopholes that, for example, Britain could with its central bank, in order to finance the high expenses involved. Previously, the damage that would be done to state banks by national competition was sufficient to prevent significant national bank chartering. But using the war crisis, Lincoln was able to expand this effort.
One of the first attempts to issue a national currency came in the early days of the Civil War when Congress approved the Legal Tender Act of 1862, allowing the issue of $150 million in national notes known as greenbacks and mandating that paper money be issued and accepted in lieu of gold and silver coins. The bills were backed only by the national government&#x27;s promise to redeem them and their value was dependent on public confidence in the government as well as the ability of the government to give out specie in exchange for the bills in the future. Many thought this promise backing the bills was about as good as the green ink printed on one side, hence the name &quot;greenbacks.&quot;

The Second Legal Tender Act, enacted July 11, 1862, a Joint Resolution of Congress, and the Third Legal Tender Act, enacted March 3, 1863, expanded the limit to $450 million. The largest amount of greenbacks outstanding at any one time was calculated as $447,300,203.10.

The National Bank Act (ch. 58, ; February 25, 1863), originally known as the National Currency Act, was passed in the Senate by a 23–21 vote, and was supplemented a year later by the National Banking Act of 1864. The goals of these acts was to create a single national currency, a nationalized bank chartering system, and to raise money for the Union war effort. The Act established national banks that could issue National Bank Notes which were backed by the United States Treasury and printed by the government itself. The quantity of notes that a bank was allowed to issue was proportional to the bank&#x27;s level of capital deposited with the Comptroller of the Currency at the Treasury. To further control the currency, the Act taxed notes issued by state and local banks, essentially pushing non-federally issued paper currency out of circulation.
Since the establishment of the Republic, state governments had held authority to regulate banks. Before the act, state legislatures typically issued bank charters on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration whether the area needed a new bank, and if the applicant was of good moral standing. As this system could be subject to corruption, states began passing &quot;free banking&quot; laws in 1837, which meant that any applicant who filled out the correct paperwork and deposited an in-kind payment to the state would be granted a charter. By the 1860s, over half of states had such a law on the books. However, the National Banking Act of 1864 (ch. 106, ; June 3, 1864) brought a close to the issue by establishing federally-issued bank charters, which took banking out of the hands of state governments. The first bank to receive a national charter was the First National Bank of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Charter #1). The first new national bank to open was The First National Bank of Davenport, Iowa (Charter #15). Additionally, more than 1,500 state banks converted themselves to national banks.

==National Bank Acts==
=== National Bank Act of 1863===
The National Bank Act of 1863, also known as the National Currency Act of 1863, was passed on February 25, 1863, and was the first attempt to establish a federal banking system after the failures of the First and Second Banks of the United States, and served as the predecessor to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The act allowed the creation of national banks, set out a plan for establishing a national currency backed by government securities held by other banks, and gave the federal government the ability to sell war bonds and securities (in order to help the war effort). National banks were chartered by the federal government, and were subject to stricter regulation; they had higher capital requirements and were not allowed to loan more than 10% of their holdings. A high tax on state banks was levied to discourage competition, and by 1865 most state banks had either received national charters or collapsed. 
===National Bank Act of 1864===

The 1864 act, based on a New York State law, brought the federal government into active supervision of commercial banks.

===National Bank Acts of 1865 and 1866===
Further acts passed in 1865 and 1866 imposed a tax to speed the adoption of the system. All banks (national or otherwise) had to pay a 10 percent tax on payments that they made in currency notes other than national bank notes. The tax rate was intentionally set so high as to effectively prohibit further circulation of state bank and private notes. By this time the conversion from state banks to national banks was well underway. The constitutionality of the tax came before the Supreme Court in &quot;Veazie Bank v. Fenno&quot;, a case by a state-chartered Maine bank and the collector of internal revenue. The Court ruled 7–2 in favor of the government. State banks declined until the 1870s, when the growing popularity of checks and the declining profitability of national bank currency issues caused a resurgence.

==Resurgence of state banks==

The granting of charters led to the creation of many national banks and a national banking system which grew at a fast pace. The number of national banks rose from 66 immediately after the Act to 7,473 in 1913. Initially, this rise in national banking came at the expense of state banking—the number of state banks dwindled from 1,466 in 1863 to 247 in 1868. Though state banks were no longer allowed to issue notes, local bankers took advantage of less strict capital requirements ($10,000 for state banks vs. $50,000–200,000 for national banks) and opened new branches en masse. These new state banks then served as competition for national banks, growing to 15,526 in number by 1913.

Hugh McCulloch originally opposed the National Banking Act but it grew on him and he organized the Currency Bureau. Part of his plans to revamp this portion of the banking system included hiring a new staff, being hands-on with several aspects such as &quot;personally evaluating applications for bank charters and consoled prospective bankers&quot;, and &quot;assisting in the design of the new national bank notes, and arranged for their engraving, printing, and distribution.&quot; As an result of McCulloch&#x27;s efforts, many banks were just not willing to conform to his system of operations. This prompted Congress to pass &quot;a 10 percent tax on the notes of state banks, signaling its determination that national banks would triumph and the state banks would fade away.&quot;

A later act, passed on March 3, 1865, imposed a tax of 10 percent on the notes of state banks to take effect on July 1, 1866. Similar to previous taxes, this effectively forced all non-federal currency from circulation. It also resulted in the creation of demand deposit accounts, and encouraged banks to join the national system, increasing the number of national banks substantially.

==Legacy==
The National Banking Acts served to create the (federal-state) dual structure that is now a defining characteristic of the U.S. banking system and economy. The Comptroller of the Currency continues to have significance in the U.S. economy and is responsible for administration and supervision of national banks as well as certain activities of bank subsidiaries (per the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999). In 2004, the Act was used by John D. Hawke, Jr., Comptroller of the Currency, to effectively bar state attorneys general from national bank oversight and regulatory roles. Many blame the resulting lack of oversight and regulation for the late-2000s recession, the bailout of the U.S. financial system and the subprime mortgage crisis.

<doc id="55601" wikidata="Q208592" url="?curid=55601" title="Sleepy Hollow (film)">
<text>Sleepy Hollow is a 1999 gothic supernatural horror film directed by Tim Burton. It is a film adaptation loosely based on Washington Irving&#x27;s 1820 short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, and stars Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, with Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Christopher Lee, and Jeffrey Jones in supporting roles. The plot follows police constable Ichabod Crane (Depp) sent from New York City to investigate a series of murders in the village of Sleepy Hollow by a mysterious Headless Horseman.

Development began in 1993 at Paramount Pictures, with Kevin Yagher originally set to direct Andrew Kevin Walker&#x27;s script as a low-budget slasher film. Disagreements with Paramount resulted in Yagher being demoted to prosthetic makeup designer, and Burton was hired to direct in June 1998. Filming took place from November 1998 to May 1999. The film was an international co-production between Germany and the United States.

The film had its world premiere at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on November 17, 1999, and was released in the United States on November 19, 1999, by Paramount Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the performances, direction, screenplay and musical score, as well as its dark humor, visual effects and atmosphere. It grossed approximately $207 million worldwide. &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction.

==Plot==

In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane is dispatched to the upstate Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, which has been plagued by a series of brutal decapitations: a wealthy father and son, and a widow. Received by the insular town elders—wealthy businessman Baltus Van Tassel; town doctor Thomas Lancaster; the Reverend Steenwyck; notary James Hardenbrook; and magistrate Samuel Philipse—Ichabod learns that locals believe the killer is the undead apparition of a headless Hessian mercenary from the American Revolutionary War who rides a black steed in search of his missing head.

Ichabod begins his investigation, skeptical of the paranormal story. Boarding at the home of Baltus and his wife, Lady Van Tassel, he is taken with Baltus&#x27; spiritual daughter, Katrina. When a fourth victim is killed, Ichabod takes the victim&#x27;s son, Young Masbath, under his wing. Ichabod and Masbath exhume the victims on a tip from Philipse, learning that the widow died pregnant; Ichabod witnesses the Horseman killing Philipse shortly after. He, Young Masbath and Katrina, venture into the Western Woods, where a crone reveals the location of the Horseman&#x27;s grave at the &quot;Tree of the Dead.&quot; He digs up the Horseman&#x27;s grave and discovers the skull has been taken, deducing that it has been stolen by someone who now controls him and that the tree is his portal into the living world.

That night, the Horseman kills the village midwife and her family, as well as Katrina&#x27;s suitor Brom when he attempts to intervene; Ichabod hypothesizes that the Horseman is attacking select targets linked by a conspiracy. He and Masbath visit Hardenbrook, who reveals that the first victim, Peter Van Garrett, had secretly married the widow, writing a new will that left his estate to her and her unborn child. Ichabod deduces that all the victims (except Brom) are either beneficiaries or witnesses to this new will, and that the Horseman&#x27;s master is the person who would have otherwise inherited the estate: Baltus, a Van Garrett relative.

Upon discovering the accusation, Katrina burns the evidence. Hardenbrook commits suicide, and Steenwyck convenes a town meeting to discredit Ichabod, but Baltus bursts into the assembly at the church, announcing that the Horseman has killed his wife. The Horseman attacks the church, but is unable to enter. In the chaos, the remaining elders turn on and attack each other: Steenwyck and Lancaster are killed, and the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out of the church and acquiring his head.

Initially concluding that Katrina controls the Horseman, Ichabod discovers that her diagram, which he believed summoned the Horseman, is really one of protection, and additionally finds a post-mortem wound on &quot;Lady Van Tassel&#x27;s&quot; body. Lady Van Tassel, alive and well, then reveals herself to Katrina, and explains her true heritage from an impoverished family evicted years ago by Van Garrett when he favored Baltus and Katrina instead. She swore revenge against Van Garrett and all who had wronged her, pledging herself to Satan if he would raise the Horseman to avenge her, and also to claim the Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates uncontested. Manipulating her way into the Van Tassel household, she used fear, blackmail, and lust to draw the other elders into her plot. Having eliminated all other heirs and witnesses — and having killed her sister, the crone, for aiding Ichabod — she summons the Horseman to finish Katrina.

Ichabod and Masbath rush to the windmill as the Horseman arrives. After an escape that destroys the windmill and the subsequent chase to the Tree of the Dead, Ichabod retrieves the Horseman&#x27;s skull from Lady Van Tassel and returns it to him, breaking the curse, and setting the Horseman free from Lady Van Tassel&#x27;s control. With his head restored, the Horseman spares Katrina and abducts Lady Van Tassel, giving her a bloody kiss and returning to Hell with her in tow. Ichabod returns to New York with Katrina and Young Masbath, just in time for the new century.

* Michael Gambon as Baltus Van Tassel: Katrina&#x27;s father. After Peter Van Garrett is murdered, he is placed as the leader of the town.
* Casper Van Dien as Brom Van Brunt: A strong and arrogant aristocratic man who is romantically involved with Katrina. 
* Jeffrey Jones as Reverend Steenwyck: The austere, corrupt town pastor.
* Christopher Lee as the Burgomaster.

* Ian McDiarmid as Dr. Thomas Lancaster: The town doctor and surgeon.
* Michael Gough as Notary James Hardenbrook: The wizened, cowardly town notary.
* Marc Pickering as Young Masbath: An orphan who looks towards Ichabod as a father figure after his father is slain by the Horseman.
* Lisa Marie as Lady Crane &quot;(in flashbacks)&quot;: Ichabod&#x27;s mother who practiced benign witchcraft, for which she was killed by her strict religious husband.
* Steven Waddington as Mr. Killian
* Ray Park and Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman: A brutal and sadistic Hessian mercenary sent to America during the American Revolutionary War who loses his head during battle. Walken portrays the Hessian while Park performs the Headless Horseman.

* Alun Armstrong as the High Constable
* Mark Spalding as Jonathan Masbath
* Jessica Oyelowo as Sarah
* Tony Maudsley as Van Ripper

* Sean Stephens as Thomas Killian
Other roles include Michael Feast as Spotty Man, Jamie Foreman as Thuggish Constable, Philip Martin Brown as a Constable, and an uncredited Martin Landau as Peter Van Garrett, Sleepy Hollow&#x27;s chief citizen until his death at the hands of the Headless Horseman.

==Production==

===Development===
In 1993, Kevin Yagher, a make-up effects designer who had turned to directing with &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, had the notion to adapt Washington Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; into a feature film. Through his agent, Yagher was introduced to Andrew Kevin Walker; they spent a few months working on a film treatment that transformed Ichabod Crane from a schoolmaster from Connecticut to a banished New York City detective. Yagher and Walker subsequently pitched &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; to various studios and production companies, eventually securing a deal with producer Scott Rudin, who had been impressed with Walker&#x27;s unproduced spec script for &quot;Seven&quot;. Rudin optioned the project to Paramount Pictures in a deal that had Yagher set to direct, with Walker scripting; the pair would share story credit. Following the completion of &quot;&quot;, Yagher had planned &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; as &quot;a low-budget effects showcase with a spectacular murder every five minutes or so,&quot; characterized by its screenwriter as a &quot;pretentious slasher movie&quot;. Paramount had reservations about the film, interpreting it as a typical period piece—&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say they weren&#x27;t enthusiastic about it, but they didn&#x27;t see the commercial viability,&quot; producer Adam Schroeder noted. &quot;The studio thinks &#x27;old literary classic&#x27; and they think &quot;The Crucible&quot;. There was a fear about that... We started developing it before horror movies came back.&quot;

Paramount CEO Sherry Lansing revived studio interest in 1998. Schroeder, who shepherded Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; as a studio executive at 20th Century Fox in 1990, suggested that Burton direct the film. Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope; Burton only became aware of Coppola&#x27;s involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;″s trailer and saw Coppola&#x27;s name on it. Burton, coming off the troubled production of &quot;Superman Lives&quot;, was hired to direct in June 1998. Excited about Burton&#x27;s involvement, Yagher stepped down as director &quot;with good grace&quot;, remaining involved in the project as the lead creature effects artist. Burton considered the film his first venture into a primarily horror-focused tone. &quot;I had never really done something that was more of a horror film,&quot; he explained, &quot;and it&#x27;s funny, because those are the kind of movies that I like probably more than any other genre.&quot; His interest in directing a horror film was influenced by his love for Hammer Film Productions and &quot;Black Sunday&quot;—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. As a result, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is an homage to various Hammer Film Productions, including &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde&quot;, and other films such as &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, various Roger Corman horror films, &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;, and &quot;Scream Blacula Scream&quot;. The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s. &quot;One of my teachers had worked on the Disney version as one of the layout artists on the chase, and he brought in some layouts from it, so that was exciting. It was one of the things that maybe shaped what I like to do.&quot; Burton worked with Walker on rewrites, but Rudin suggested that Tom Stoppard rewrite the script to add to the comical aspects of Ichabod&#x27;s bumbling mannerisms, and emphasize the character&#x27;s romance with Katrina. His work went uncredited through the WGA screenwriting credit system.

=== Casting ===
While Johnny Depp was Burton&#x27;s first choice for the role of Ichabod Crane, Paramount required him to consider Brad Pitt, Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis. Depp was cast in July 1998 for his third collaboration with Burton. Depp wanted Ichabod to parallel Irving&#x27;s description of the character in the short story. This included a long prosthetic snipe nose, huge ears, and elongated fingers. Paramount turned down his suggestions, and after Depp read Tom Stoppard&#x27;s rewrite of the script, he was inspired to take the character even further. &quot;I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl,&quot; Depp explained. He did not wish to portray the character as a typical action star would have, and instead took inspiration by Angela Lansbury&#x27;s performance in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s good,&quot; Burton reasoned, &quot;because I&#x27;m not the greatest action director, or the greatest director in any genre, and he&#x27;s not the greatest action star, or the greatest star in any genre.&quot; Depp modeled Ichabod&#x27;s detective personality from Basil Rathbone in the 1939 &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; film series. He also studied Roddy McDowall&#x27;s acting for additional influence. Burton added that &quot;the idea was to try to find an elegance in action of the kind that Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing or Vincent Price had.&quot;

&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; also reunited Burton with Jeffrey Jones (from &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and &quot;Ed Wood&quot;) as Reverend Steenwyck, Christopher Walken (Max Shreck in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;) as the Hessian Horseman, Martin Landau (&quot;Ed Wood&quot;) in a cameo role, and Hammer veteran Michael Gough (Alfred in Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; films), whom Burton tempted out of retirement. The Hammer influence was further confirmed by the casting of Christopher Lee in a small role as the Burgomaster who sends Crane to Sleepy Hollow.

===Filming===
The original intention had been to shoot &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; predominantly on location with a $30 million budget. Towns were scouted throughout Upstate New York along the Hudson Valley, and the filmmakers decided on Tarrytown for an October 1998 start date. The Historic Hudson Valley organization assisted in scouting locations, which included the Philipsburg Manor House and forests in the Rockefeller State Park Preserve. &quot;They had a wonderful quality to them,&quot; production designer Rick Heinrichs reflected on the locations, &quot;but it wasn&#x27;t quite lending itself to the sort of expressionism that we were going for, which wanted to express the feeling of foreboding.&quot; Disappointed, the filmmakers scouted locations in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, and considered using Dutch colonial villages and period town recreations in the Northeastern United States. When no suitable existing location could be found, coupled with a lack of readily available studio space in the New York area needed to house the production&#x27;s large number of sets, producer Scott Rudin suggested the United Kingdom.

Rudin believed Britain offered the level of craftsmanship in period detail, painting and costuming that was suitable for the film&#x27;s design. Having directed &quot;Batman&quot; entirely in Britain, Burton agreed, and designers from &quot;Batman&quot;″s art department were employed by Paramount for &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;. As a result, principal photography was pushed back to November 20, 1998, at Leavesden Film Studios, which had been recently vacated by &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. The majority of filming took place at Leavesden, with other work taking place at Shepperton Studios, where the massive Tree of the Dead set was built using Stage H. Production then moved to the Culden Faw Estate, Hambleden for a month-long shoot in March, where the town of Sleepy Hollow was constructed. &quot;We came to England figuring we would find a perfect little town,&quot; producer Adam Schroeder recalled, &quot;and then we had to build it anyway.&quot; Filming in Britain continued through April, and a few scenes were shot using a sound stage in Yonkers, New York the following May.

===Design===
Responsible for the film&#x27;s production design was Rick Heinrichs, whom Burton intended to use on &quot;Superman Lives&quot;. While the production crew was always going to build a substantial number of sets, the decision was made early on that optimally fulfilling Burton&#x27;s vision would necessitate shooting &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; in a totally controlled environment at Leavesden Film Studios. The production design was influenced by Burton&#x27;s love for Hammer Film Productions and the film &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1960)—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. Heinrichs was also influenced by American colonial architecture, German expressionist cinema, Dr. Seuss illustrations, and Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Dracula Has Risen from the Grave&quot;.

One sound stage at Leavesden was dedicated to the &quot;Forest to Field&quot; set, for the scene in which the Headless Horseman races out of the woods and into a field. This stage was then transformed into, variously, a graveyard, a corn field, a field of harvested wheat, a churchyard, and a snowy battlefield. In addition, a small backlot area was devoted to a New York City street and waterfront tank.

====Cinematography====
Burton was impressed by the cinematography in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1998) and hired Emmanuel Lubezki as &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;″s director of photography. Initially, Lubezki and Burton contemplated shooting the film in black and white, and in old square Academy ratio. When that proved unfeasible, they opted to apply bleach bypass to desaturate the image and increase the color black. Burton and Lubezki intentionally planned the over-dependency of smoke and soft lighting to accompany the film&#x27;s sole wide-angle lens strategy. Lubezki also used Hammer horror and Mexican Luchador films from the 1960s, such as &quot;Santo Contra los Zombies&quot; and &quot;Santo vs. las Mujeres Vampiro&quot;. Lighting effects increased the dynamic energy of the Headless Horseman, while the contrast of the film stock was increased in post-production to add to the monochromatic feel.

Leavesden Studios, a converted airplane factory, presented problems because of its relatively low ceilings. This was less of an issue for &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, in which set height was generally achieved by digital means. &quot;Our visual choices get channeled and violent,&quot; Heinrichs elaborated, &quot;so you end up with liabilities that you tend to exploit as virtues. When you&#x27;ve got a certain ceiling height, and you&#x27;re dealing with painted backings, you need to push atmosphere and diffusion.&quot; This was particularly the case in several exteriors that were built on sound stages. &quot;We would mitigate the disadvantages by hiding lights with teasers and smoke.&quot;

====Visual effects====
The majority of &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;″s 150 visual effects shots were handled by Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), while Kevin Yagher supervised the human and creature effects. Framestore also assisted on digital effects, and The Mill handled motion control photography. In part a reaction to the computer-generated effects in &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, Burton opted to use as limited an amount of digital effects as possible. Ray Park, who served as the Headless Horseman stunt double, wore a blue ski mask for the chroma key effect, digitally removed by ILM. Burton and Heinrichs applied to &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; many of the techniques they had used in stop motion animation on &quot;Vincent&quot;—such as forced perspective sets.

The windmill was a 60-foot-tall forced-perspective exterior (visible to highway travellers miles away), a base and rooftop set and a quarter-scale miniature. The interior of the mill, which was about 30 feet high and 25 feet wide, featured wooden gears equipped with mechanisms for grinding flour. A wider view of the windmill was rendered on a Leavesden soundstage set with a quarter-scale windmill, complete with rotating vanes, painted sky backdrop and special-effects fire. &quot;It was scary for the actors who were having burning wood explode at them,&quot; Heinrichs recalled. &quot;There were controls in place and people standing by with hoses, of course, but there&#x27;s always a chance of something going wrong.&quot; For the final shot of the burning mill exploding, the quarter-scale windmill and painted backdrop were erected against the outside wall of the &quot;flight shed&quot;, a spacious hangar on the far side of Leavesden Studios. The hangar&#x27;s interior walls were knocked down to create a 450-foot run, with a 40-foot width still allowing for coach and cameras. Heinrichs tailored the sets so cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki could shoot from above without seeing the end of the stage.

Actor Ian McDiarmid, who portrayed Dr. Lancaster, had just finished another Leavesden production with &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. He compared the aesthetics of the two films, stating that physical sets helped the actors get into a natural frame of mind. &quot;Having come from the blue-screen world of &quot;Star Wars&quot; it was wonderful to see gigantic, beautifully made perspective sets and wonderful clothes, and also people recreating a world. It&#x27;s like the way movies used to be done&quot;

===Musical score===
The film score was written and produced by Danny Elfman. It won the Golden Satellite Award and was also nominated by the Las Vegas Film Critics.

==Release==
===Marketing===
To promote &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, Paramount Pictures featured the film&#x27;s trailer at San Diego Comic-Con in August 1999. The following October, the studio launched a website, which &quot;Variety&quot; described as being the &quot;most ambitious online launch of a motion picture to date.&quot; The site (sleepyhollowmovie.com) offered visitors live video chats with several of the filmmakers hosted by Yahoo! Movies and enabled them to send postcards, view photos, trailers and a six-minute behind-the-scenes featurette edited from a broadcast that aired on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. Extensive tours of 10 sets were offered, where visitors were able to roam around photographs, including the sets for the entire town of Sleepy Hollow, forest, church, graveyard and covered bridge. Arthur Cohen, president of worldwide marketing for Paramount, explained that the &quot;Web-friendly&quot; pre-release reports from websites such as Ain&#x27;t It Cool News and Dark Horizons encouraged the studio to create the site. In the weeks pre-dating the release of &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, a toy line was marketed by McFarlane Toys. Simon &amp; Schuster also published &quot;The Art of Sleepy Hollow&quot; (), which included the film&#x27;s screenplay and an introduction by Tim Burton. A novelization, also published by Simon &amp; Schuster, was written by Peter Lerangis.

===Box office===
&quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; was released in the United States on November 19, 1999, in 3,069 theaters, grossing $30,060,467 in its opening weekend at the No. 2 spot behind &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. It would drop into fourth place behind the latter film, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and &quot;End of Days&quot; the following weekend. &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; eventually earned $101,068,340 in domestic gross, and $106 million in foreign sales, coming to a worldwide total of $207,068,340.

===Home media===
Paramount Home Video first released &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; on DVD and VHS in the United States on May 23, 2000. The HD DVD release came in July 2006, while the film was released on Blu-ray two years later, in June 2008.
An unofficial video game adaptation of the film titled &quot;Cursed Fates: The Headless Horseman&quot; was released by Fenomen Games and Big Fish Games on January 6, 2013. For the 20th anniversary, Paramount Home Entertainment released a Blu-ray digibook with a photobook containing the original story on September 24, 2019. For the upcoming 25th anniversary of the film, Paramount Pictures released a remastered 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version on September 5, 2023. 

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 71% of critics gave &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; a positive review based on 129 reviews with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states, &quot;It isn&#x27;t Tim Burton&#x27;s best work, but &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; entertains with its stunning visuals and creepy atmosphere.&quot; Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 35 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be &quot;generally favorable&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 stars out of 4 and said: &quot;This is the best-looking horror film since Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;&quot;. He praised Johnny Depp&#x27;s performance and Tim Burton&#x27;s methods of visual design. &quot;Johnny Depp is an actor able to disappear into characters,&quot; Ebert continued, &quot;never more readily than in one of Burton&#x27;s films.&quot; Richard Corliss wrote, in his review for &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Burton&#x27;s richest, prettiest, weirdest [film] since &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. The simple story bends to his twists, freeing him for an exercise in high style.&quot; David Sterritt of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; gave praise to filmmaking and the high-spirited acting of cast, but believed Andrew Kevin Walker&#x27;s writing was too repetitious and formulaic for the third act.

Owen Gleiberman from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; is &quot;a choppily plotted crowd-pleaser that lacks the seductive, freakazoid alchemy of Burton&#x27;s best work.&quot; Gleiberman compared the film to &quot;The Mummy&quot;, and said &quot;it feels like every high-powered action climax of the last 10 years. Personally, I&#x27;d rather see Burton so intoxicated by a movie that he lost his head.&quot; Andrew Johnston of &quot;Time Out New York&quot; wrote &quot;[l]ike the best of Burton&#x27;s films, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; takes place in a world so richly imagined that, despite its abundant terrors, you can&#x27;t help wanting to step through the screen.&quot; Mick LaSalle, writing in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, criticized Burton&#x27;s perceived image as a creative artist. &quot;All &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; has going for it is art direction, and even in that it falls back on cliché.&quot;

Jonathan Rosenbaum from the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; &quot;a ravishing visual experience, a pretty good vehicle for some talented American and English actors,&quot; but concluded that the film was a missed opportunity to depict an actual representation of the short story. &quot;Burton&#x27;s fidelity is exclusively to the period feeling he gets from disreputable Hammer horror films and a few images culled from &quot;Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot;. When it comes to one of America&#x27;s great stories, Burton obviously couldn&#x27;t care less.&quot;

<text>The peanut (Arachis hypogaea), also known as the groundnut, goober (US), goober pea, pindar (US) or monkey nut (UK), is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds. It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics by small and large commercial producers, both as grain legume and as an oil crop. Atypically among legumes, peanut pods develop underground leading botanist Carl Linnaeus to name peanuts &quot;hypogaea&quot;, which means &quot;under the earth&quot;.

The peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae), commonly known as the legume, bean, or pea family. Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules, which improve soil fertility, making them valuable in crop rotations.

Despite not meeting the botanical definition of a nut as &quot;a fruit whose ovary wall becomes hard at maturity,&quot; peanuts are usually categorized as nuts for culinary purposes and in common English. Some people are allergic to peanuts, a potentially fatal reaction to peanuts; this is distinct from tree nut allergies.

Peanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds, and, as a culinary nut, are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines. World production of shelled peanuts in 2020 was 54 million tonnes, led by China with 34% of the total.

== Botanical description ==
The peanut is an annual herbaceous plant growing tall. As a legume, it belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae, also known as Leguminosae, and commonly known as the legume, bean, or pea family. Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nodules.

The leaves are opposite and pinnate with four leaflets (two opposite pairs; no terminal leaflet); each leaflet is long and across. Like those of many other legumes, the leaves are nyctinastic; that is, they have &quot;sleep&quot; movements, closing at night.

The flowers are across, and yellowish orange with reddish veining. They are borne in axillary clusters on the stems above ground and last for just one day. The ovary is located at the base of what appears to be the flower stem but is a highly elongated floral cup.

Peanut fruits develop underground, an unusual feature known as geocarpy. After fertilization, a short stalk at the base of the ovary—often termed a gynophore, but which appears to be part of the ovary—elongates to form a thread-like structure known as a &quot;peg&quot;. This peg grows into the soil, allowing the fruit to develop underground. These pods, technically called legumes, are long, normally containing one to four seeds. The shell of the peanut fruit consists primarily of a mesocarp with several large veins traversing its length.
Parts of the peanut include:
* Shell – outer covering, in contact with soil
* Cotyledons (two) – the main edible part
* Seed coat – brown paper-like covering of the edible part
* Radicle – embryonic root at the bottom of the cotyledon, which can be snapped off
* Plumule – embryonic shoot emerging from the top of the radicle

=== Peanut phytochemistry ===
Peanuts contain polyphenols, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, phytosterols and dietary fiber in amounts similar to several tree nuts. Peanut skins contain resveratrol.

== History ==
The &quot;Arachis&quot; genus is native to South America, east of the Andes, around Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil. Cultivated peanuts (&quot;A. hypogaea&quot;) arose from a hybrid between two wild species of peanut, thought to be &quot;A. duranensis&quot; and &quot;A. ipaensis&quot;. The initial hybrid would have been sterile, but spontaneous chromosome doubling restored its fertility, forming what is termed an amphidiploid or allotetraploid. Genetic analysis suggests the hybridization may have occurred only once and gave rise to &quot;A. monticola&quot;, a wild form of peanut that occurs in a few limited locations in northwestern Argentina, or in southeastern Bolivia, where the peanut landraces with the most wild-like features are grown today, and by artificial selection to &quot;A. hypogaea&quot;.

The process of domestication through artificial selection made &quot;A. hypogaea&quot; dramatically different from its wild relatives. The domesticated plants are bushier, more compact, and have a different pod structure and larger seeds. From this primary center of origin, cultivation spread and formed secondary and tertiary centers of diversity in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Over time, thousands of peanut landraces evolved; these are classified into six botanical varieties and two subspecies (as listed in the peanut scientific classification table). Subspecies &quot;A. h. fastigiata&quot; types are more upright in their growth habit and have shorter crop cycles. Subspecies &quot;A. h. hypogaea&quot; types spread more on the ground and have longer crop cycles.

The oldest known archeological remains of pods have been dated at about 7,600 years old, possibly a wild species that was in cultivation, or &quot;A. hypogaea&quot; in the early phase of domestication. They were found in Peru, where dry climatic conditions are favorable for the preservation of organic material. Almost certainly, peanut cultivation antedated this at the center of origin where the climate is moister. Many pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Moche, depicted peanuts in their art. Cultivation was well-established in Mesoamerica before the Spanish arrived. There, the conquistadors found the (the plant&#x27;s Nahuatl name, hence the name in Spanish &quot;cacahuate&quot;) offered for sale in the marketplace of Tenochtitlan. Its cultivation was introduced in Europe in the 19th century through Spain, particularly Valencia, where it is still produced, albeit marginally. European traders later spread the peanut worldwide, and cultivation is now widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. In West Africa, it substantially replaced a crop plant from the same family, the Bambara groundnut, whose seed pods also develop underground. In Asia, it became an agricultural mainstay, and this region is now the largest producer in the world.

Peanuts were introduced to the US during the colonial period and grown as a garden crop. According to Bernard Romans, groundnuts were introduced into colonial East Florida by Black people from &quot;Guinea&quot;, where the plant is also endemic. Starting in 1870 they were used as an animal feedstock until human consumption grew in the 1930s. George Washington Carver (1864–1943) championed the peanut as part of his efforts for agricultural extension in the American South, where soils were depleted after repeated plantings of cotton. He invented and promulgated hundreds of peanut-based products, including cosmetics, paints, plastics, gasoline and nitroglycerin.

The US Department of Agriculture initiated a program to encourage agricultural production and human consumption of peanuts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Peanut butter was developed in the 1890s in the US. It became well known after the Beech-Nut company began selling peanut butter at the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair of 1904.

== Varieties ==
=== Cultivars in the United States ===

There are many peanut cultivars grown around the world. The market classes grown in the United States are Spanish, Runner, Virginia, and Valencia. Peanut production in the US is divided into three major areas: the southeastern US region which includes Alabama, Georgia, and Florida; the southwestern US region which includes New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas; and the third region in the general eastern US which includes Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. In Georgia, Naomi Chapman Woodroof is responsible for developing the breeding program of peanuts resulting in a harvest almost five times greater.

Certain cultivar groups are preferred for particular characteristics, such as differences in flavor, oil content, size, shape, and disease resistance. Most peanuts marketed in the shell are of the Virginia type, along with some Valencias selected for large size and the attractive appearance of the shell. Spanish peanuts are used mostly for peanut candy, salted nuts, and peanut butter.

==== Spanish group ====
The small Spanish types are grown in South Africa and the southwestern and southeastern United States. Until 1940, 90% of the peanuts grown in the US state of Georgia were Spanish types, but the trend since then has been larger-seeded, higher-yielding, more disease-resistant cultivars. Spanish peanuts have a higher oil content than other types of peanuts. In the US, the Spanish group is primarily grown in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.

Cultivars of the Spanish group include &#x27;Dixie Spanish&#x27;, &#x27;Improved Spanish 2B&#x27;, &#x27;GFA Spanish&#x27;, &#x27;Argentine&#x27;, &#x27;Spantex&#x27;, &#x27;Spanette&#x27;, &#x27;Shaffers Spanish&#x27;, &#x27;Natal Common (Spanish)&#x27;, &quot;White Kernel Varieties&#x27;, &#x27;Starr&#x27;, &#x27;Comet&#x27;, &#x27;Florispan&#x27;, &#x27;Spanhoma&#x27;, &#x27;Spancross&#x27;, &#x27;OLin&#x27;, &#x27;Tamspan 90&#x27;, &#x27;AT 9899–14&#x27;, &#x27;Spanco&#x27;, &#x27;Wilco I&#x27;, &#x27;GG 2&#x27;, &#x27;GG 4&#x27;, &#x27;TMV 2&#x27;, and &#x27;Tamnut 06&#x27;.

==== Runner group ====
Since 1940, the southeastern US region has seen a shift to producing Runner group peanuts. This shift is due to good flavor, better roasting characteristics, and higher yields when compared to Spanish types, leading to food manufacturers&#x27; preference for the use in peanut butter and salted nuts. Georgia&#x27;s production is now almost 100% Runner-type.

Cultivars of Runners include &#x27;Southeastern Runner 56-15&#x27;, &#x27;Dixie Runner&#x27;, &#x27;Early Runner&#x27;, &#x27;Virginia Bunch 67&#x27;, &#x27;Bradford Runner&#x27;, &#x27;Egyptian Giant&#x27; (also known as &#x27;Virginia Bunch&#x27; and &#x27;Giant&#x27;), &#x27;Rhodesian Spanish Bunch&#x27; (Valencia and Virginia Bunch), &#x27;North Carolina Runner 56-15&#x27;, &#x27;Florunner&#x27;, &#x27;Virugard&#x27;, &#x27;Georgia Green&#x27;, &#x27;Tamrun 96&#x27;, &#x27;Flavor Runner 458&#x27;, &#x27;Tamrun OL01&#x27;, &#x27;Tamrun OL02&#x27; &#x27;AT-120&#x27;, &#x27;Andru-93&#x27;, &#x27;Southern Runner&#x27;, &#x27;AT1-1&#x27;, &#x27;Georgia Brown&#x27;, &#x27;GK-7&#x27;, and &#x27;AT-108&#x27;.

==== Virginia group ====
The large-seeded Virginia group peanuts are grown in the US states of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and parts of Georgia. They are increasing in popularity due to the demand for large peanuts for processing, particularly for salting, confections, and roasting in shells.

Virginia group peanuts are either bunch or running in growth habit. The bunch type is upright to spreading. It attains a height of , and a spread of , with rows that seldom cover the ground. The pods are borne within of the base of the plant.

Cultivars of Virginia-type peanuts include &#x27;NC 7&#x27;, &#x27;NC 9&#x27;, &#x27;NC 10C&#x27;, &#x27;NC-V 11&#x27;, &#x27;VA 93B&#x27;, &#x27;NC 12C&#x27;, &#x27;VA-C 92R&#x27;, &#x27;Gregory&#x27;, &#x27;VA 98R&#x27;, &#x27;Perry&#x27;, &#x27;Wilson, &#x27;Hull&#x27;, &#x27;AT VC-2&#x27; and &#x27;Shulamit&#x27;.

==== Valencia group ====

Valencia group peanuts are coarse and have heavy reddish stems and large foliage. In the United States, large commercial production is primarily in the South Plains of West Texas and in eastern New Mexico near and south of Portales, but they are grown on a small scale elsewhere in the South as the best-flavored and preferred type for boiled peanuts. They are comparatively tall, reaching a height of and a spread of . Peanut pods are borne on pegs arising from the main stem and the side branches. Most pods are clustered around the base of the plant, and only a few are found several inches away. Valencia types are three- to five-seeded and smooth, with no constriction of the shell between the seeds. Seeds are oval and tightly crowded into the pods. Typical seed weight is 0.4 to 0.5 g. This type is used heavily for selling roasted and salted in-shell peanuts and peanut butter. Varieties include &#x27;Valencia A&#x27; and &#x27;Valencia C&#x27;.

==== Tennessee Red and Tennessee White groups ====
These are alike except for the color of the seed. Sometimes known also as Texas Red or White, the plants are similar to Valencia types, except the stems are green to greenish brown, and the pods are rough, irregular, and have a smaller proportion of kernels.

== Cultivation ==
Peanuts grow best in light, sandy loam soil with a pH of 5.9–7. Their capacity to fix nitrogen means that providing they nodulate properly, peanuts benefit little or not at all from nitrogen-containing fertilizer, and they improve soil fertility. Therefore, they are valuable in crop rotations. Also, the yield of the peanut crop itself is increased in rotations through reduced diseases, pests, and weeds. For example, in Texas, peanuts in a three-year rotation with corn yield 50% more than nonrotated peanuts. Adequate levels of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and micronutrients are also necessary for good yields. Peanuts need warm weather throughout the growing season to develop well. They can be grown with as little as of water, but for best yields need at least . Depending on growing conditions and the cultivar of peanut, harvest is usually 90 to 130 days after planting for subspecies &quot;A. h. fastigiata&quot; types, and 120 to 150 days after planting for subspecies &quot;A. h. hypogaea&quot; types. Subspecies &quot;A. h. hypogaea&quot; types yield more and are usually preferred where the growing seasons are sufficiently long.

Peanut plants continue to produce flowers when pods are developing; therefore, some pods are immature even when they are ready for harvest. To maximize yield, the timing of harvest is important. If it is too early, too many pods will be unripe; if too late, the pods will snap off at the stalk and remain in the soil. For harvesting, the entire plant, including most of the roots, is removed from the soil. The pods are covered with a network of raised veins and are constricted between seeds.

The main yield-limiting factors in semi-arid regions are drought and high-temperature stress. The stages of reproductive development before flowering, at flowering, and at early pod development are particularly sensitive to these constraints. Apart from nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, other nutrient deficiencies causing significant yield losses are calcium, iron and boron. Biotic stresses mainly include pests, diseases, and weeds. Among insects pests, pod borers, aphids, and mites are of importance. The most important diseases are leaf spots, rusts, and the toxin-producing fungus Aspergillus.
Harvesting occurs in two stages. In mechanized systems, a machine is used to cut off the main root of the peanut plant by cutting through the soil just below the level of the peanut pods. The machine lifts the &quot;bush&quot; from the ground, shakes it, then inverts it, leaving the plant upside down to keep the peanuts out of the soil. This allows the peanuts to dry slowly to a little less than a third of their original moisture level over three to four days. Traditionally, peanuts were pulled and inverted by hand.

After the peanuts have dried sufficiently, they are threshed, removing the peanut pods from the rest of the bush. Peanuts must be dried properly and stored in dry conditions. If they are too high in moisture, or if storage conditions are poor, they may become infected by the mold fungus &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;. Many strains of this fungus release toxic and highly carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins.

=== Pests and diseases ===
If peanut plants are subjected to severe drought during pod formation, or if pods are not properly stored, they may become contaminated with the mold &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; which may produce carcinogenic substances called aflatoxins. Lower-quality peanuts, particularly where mold is evident, are more likely to be contaminated. The USDA tests every truckload of raw peanuts for aflatoxin; any containing aflatoxin levels of more than 15 parts per billion are destroyed. The peanut industry has manufacturing steps to ensure all peanuts are inspected for aflatoxin. Peanuts tested to have high aflatoxin are used to make peanut oil where the mold can be removed.

The plant leaves can also be affected by a fungus, &quot;Alternaria arachidis&quot;.

== Toxicity ==

=== Allergies ===
Some people (1.4–2% in Europe and the United States) report that they experience allergic reactions to peanut exposure; symptoms can be especially severe, ranging from watery eyes to anaphylactic shock, the latter of which is generally fatal if untreated. Eating a small amount of peanuts can cause a reaction. Because of their widespread use in prepared and packaged foods, avoiding peanuts can be difficult. Reading ingredients and warnings on product packaging is necessary to avoid this allergen. Foods processed in facilities that also handle peanuts on the same equipment as other foods are required to carry such warnings on their labels. Avoiding cross-contamination with peanuts and peanut products (along with other severe allergens like shellfish) is a promoted and common practice of which chefs and restaurants worldwide are becoming aware.

The hygiene hypothesis of allergy states that a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents like germs and parasites could be causing the increase in food allergies.

Studies comparing age of peanut introduction in Great Britain with introduction in Israel showed that delaying exposure to peanuts in childhood can dramatically increase the risk of developing peanut allergies.

Peanut allergy has been associated with the use of skin preparations containing peanut oil among children, but the evidence is not regarded as conclusive. Peanut allergies have also been associated with family history and intake of soy products.

Some school districts in the US and elsewhere have banned peanuts or products containing peanuts. However, the efficacy of the bans in reducing allergic reactions is uncertain. A 2015 study in Canada found no difference in the percentage of accidental exposures occurring in schools prohibiting peanuts compared to schools allowing them.

Refined peanut oil will not cause allergic reactions in most people with peanut allergies. However, crude (unrefined) peanut oils have been shown to contain protein, which may cause allergic reactions. In a randomized, double-blind crossover study, 60 people with proven peanut allergy were challenged with both crude peanut oil and refined peanut oil. The authors concluded, &quot;Crude peanut oil caused allergic reactions in 10% of allergic subjects studied and should continue to be avoided.&quot; They also stated, &quot;Refined peanut oil does not seem to pose a risk to most people with peanut allergy.&quot; However, they point out that refined peanut oil can still pose a risk to peanut-allergic individuals if the oil that has previously been used for cooking foods containing peanuts is reused.

== Uses ==

=== Nutrition ===
Raw Valencia peanuts are 4% water, 48% fat, 25% protein, and 21% carbohydrates, including 9% dietary fiber (USDA nutrient data).

Peanuts are rich in essential nutrients. In a reference amount of , peanuts provide of food energy, and are an excellent source (defined as more than 20% of the Daily Value, DV) of several B vitamins, vitamin E, several dietary minerals, such as manganese (95% DV), magnesium (52% DV) and phosphorus (48% DV), and dietary fiber. The fats are mainly polyunsaturated and monounsaturated (83% of total fats when combined).

Some studies show that regular consumption of peanuts is associated with a lower specific risk of mortality from certain diseases. However, the study designs do not allow cause and effect to be inferred. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, &quot;Scientific evidence suggests but does not prove that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts (such as peanuts) as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.&quot;

=== Culinary ===

==== Whole peanuts ====

Dry-roasting peanuts is a common form of preparation. Dry peanuts can be roasted in the shell or shelled in a home oven if spread out one layer deep in a pan and baked at a temperature of for 15 to 20 min (shelled) and 20 to 25 min (in shell).

Boiled peanuts are a popular snack in India, China, West Africa, and the southern United States. In the US South, boiled peanuts are often prepared in briny water and sold in streetside stands.

A distinction can be drawn between raw and green peanuts. A green peanut is a term to describe farm-fresh harvested peanuts that have not been dehydrated. They are available from grocery stores, food distributors, and farmers markets during the growing season. Raw peanuts are also uncooked but have been dried/dehydrated and must be rehydrated before boiling (usually in a bowl full of water overnight). Once rehydrated, the raw peanuts are ready to be boiled.

==== Peanut oil ====


Peanut oil is often used in cooking because it has a mild flavor and a relatively high smoke point. Due to its high monounsaturated content, it is considered more healthful than saturated oils and is resistant to rancidity. The several types of peanut oil include aromatic roasted peanut oil, refined peanut oil, extra virgin or cold-pressed peanut oil, and peanut extract. Refined peanut oil is exempt from allergen labeling laws in the US.

A common cooking and salad oil, peanut oil is 46% monounsaturated fats (primarily oleic acid), 32% polyunsaturated fats (primarily linoleic acid), and 17% saturated fats (primarily palmitic acid). Extractable from whole peanuts using a simple water and centrifugation method, the oil is being considered by NASA&#x27;s Advanced Life Support program for future long-duration human space missions.

==== Peanut butter ====

Peanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground dry roasted peanuts. It often contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Many companies have added twists on traditionally plain peanut butter by adding various flavor varieties, such as chocolate, birthday cake, and cinnamon raisin. Peanut butter is served as a spread on bread, toast or crackers, and used to make sandwiches (notably the peanut butter and jelly sandwich). It is also used in a number of confections, such as peanut-flavored granola bars or croissants and other pastries. The United States is a leading exporter of peanut butter, and itself consumes $800 million of peanut butter annually.

==== Peanut flour ====
Peanut flour is used in gluten-free cooking.

==== Peanut proteins ====
Peanut protein concentrates and isolates are commercially produced from defatted peanut flour using several methods. Peanut flour concentrates (about 70% protein) are produced from dehulled kernels by removing most of the oil and the water-soluble, non-protein components. Hydraulic pressing, screw pressing, solvent extraction, and pre-pressing followed by solvent extraction may be used for oil removal, after which protein isolation and purification are implemented.

==== Latin America ====

Peanuts are particularly common in Peruvian and Mexican cuisine, both of which marry indigenous and European ingredients. For instance, in Peru, a popular traditional dish is &quot;picante de cuy&quot;, a roasted guinea pig served in a sauce of ground peanuts (ingredients native to South America) with roasted onions and garlic (ingredients from European cuisine). Also, in the Peruvian city of Arequipa, a dish called &quot;ocopa&quot; consists of a smooth sauce of roasted peanuts and hot peppers (both native to the region) with roasted onions, garlic, and oil, poured over meat or potatoes. Another example is a fricassee combining a similar mixture with sautéed seafood or boiled and shredded chicken. These dishes are generally known as &quot;ajíes&quot;, meaning &quot;hot peppers&quot;, such as &quot;ají de pollo&quot; and &quot;ají de mariscos&quot; (seafood &quot;ajíes&quot; may omit peanuts). In Mexico, it is also used to prepare different traditional dishes, such as chicken in peanut sauce (&quot;encacahuatado&quot;), and is used as the main ingredient for the preparation of other famous dishes such as red pipián, mole poblano and oaxacan mole negro.

Likewise, during colonial times in Peru, the Spanish used peanuts to replace nuts unavailable locally but used extensively in Spanish cuisine, such as almonds and pine nuts, typically ground or as a paste mixed with rice, meats, and vegetables for dishes like rice pilaf.

Throughout the region, many candies and snacks are made using peanuts. In Mexico, it is common to find them in different presentations as a snack or candy: salty, &quot;Japanese&quot; peanuts, praline, &quot;enchilados&quot; or in the form of a traditional sweet made with peanuts and honey called &quot;palanqueta&quot;, and even as peanut marzipan. There is a similar form of peanut candy in Brazil, called pé-de-moleque, made with peanuts and molasses, which resembles the Indian chikki in form.

==== West Asia ====

Crunchy coated peanuts, called &quot;kabukim&quot; in Hebrew, are a popular snack in Israel. &quot;Kabukim&quot; are commonly sold by weight at corner stores where fresh nuts and seeds are sold, though they are also available packaged. The coating typically consists of flour, salt, starch, lecithin, and sometimes sesame seeds. The origin of the name is obscure (it may be derived from &quot;kabuk&quot;, which means nutshell or husk in Turkish). An additional variety of crunchy coated peanuts popular in Israel is &quot;American peanuts&quot;. The coating of this variety is thinner but harder to crack.

Bamba puffs are a popular snack in Israel. Their shape is similar to Cheez Doodles, but they are made of peanuts and corn.

==== Southeast Asia ====

Peanuts are also widely used in Southeast Asian cuisine, such as in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia, where they are typically made into a spicy sauce. Peanuts came to Indonesia from the Philippines, where the legume was derived from Mexico during Spanish colonization. One Philippine dish using peanuts is &quot;kare-kare&quot;, a mixture of meat and peanut butter. Apart from being used in dishes, fried shelled peanuts are a common inexpensive snack in the Philippines. The peanuts are commonly served plain salted with garlic chips and variants, including adobo and chili flavors.

Common Indonesian peanut-based dishes include &quot;gado-gado&quot;, &quot;pecel&quot;, &quot;karedok&quot;, and &quot;ketoprak&quot;, vegetable salads mixed with peanut sauce, and the peanut-based sauce, &quot;satay&quot;.

==== Indian subcontinent ====

In the Indian subcontinent, peanuts are a light snack, usually roasted and salted (sometimes with the addition of chilli powder), and often sold roasted in pods or boiled with salt. They are also made into dessert or sweet snack of peanut brittle by processing with refined sugar and jaggery. Indian cuisine uses roasted, crushed peanuts to give a crunchy body to salads; they are added whole (without pods) to leafy vegetable stews for the same reason. Another use is peanut oil for cooking. Most Indians use mustard, sunflower, and peanut oil for cooking. In South India, groundnut chutney is eaten with &quot;dosa&quot; and &quot;idli&quot; as breakfast. Peanuts are also used in sweets and savory items in South India and also as a flavor in tamarind rice. Kovilpatti is known for its sweet peanut chikki or peanut brittle, which is also used in savory and sweet mixtures, such as Bombay mix.

==== West Africa ====
Peanuts grow well in southern Mali and adjacent regions of the Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal; peanuts are similar in both agricultural and culinary qualities to the Bambara groundnut native to the region, and West Africans have adopted the crop as a staple. Peanut sauce, prepared with onions, garlic, peanut butter/paste, and vegetables such as carrots, cabbage, and cauliflower, can be vegetarian (the peanuts supplying ample protein) or prepared with meat, usually chicken.

Peanuts are used in the Malian meat stew &quot;maafe&quot;. In Ghana, peanut butter is used for peanut butter soup &quot;nkate nkwan&quot;. Crushed peanuts may also be used for peanut candies &quot;nkate cake&quot; and &quot;kuli-kuli&quot;, as well as other local foods such as &quot;oto&quot;. Peanut butter is an ingredient in Nigeria&#x27;s &quot;African salad&quot;. Peanut powder is an important ingredient in the spicy coating for kebabs (Suya) in Nigeria and Ghana.
==== East Africa ====
Peanuts are a common ingredient of several types of relishes (dishes which accompany &quot;nshima&quot;) eaten in Malawi, and in the eastern part of Zambia, and these dishes are common throughout both countries. Thick peanut butter sauces are also made in Uganda to serve with rice and other starchy foods. Groundnut stew, called &quot;ebinyebwa&quot; in Luganda-speaking areas of Uganda, is made by boiling ground peanut flour with other ingredients, such as cabbage, mushrooms, dried fish, meat or other vegetables. Across East Africa, roasted peanuts, often in cones of newspaper, are obtained from street vendors.

==== North America ====

The state of Georgia leads the US in peanut production, with 49 percent of the nation&#x27;s peanut acreage and output. In 2014, farmers cultivated 591,000 acres of peanuts, yielding of 2.4 billion pounds. The most famous peanut farmer was Jimmy Carter of Sumter County, Georgia who became US president in 1976.

In the US and Canada, peanuts are used in candies, cakes, cookies, and other sweets. Individually, they are eaten dry-roasted with or without salt. Ninety-five percent of Canadians eat peanuts or peanut butter, with the average consumption of of peanuts per person annually, and 79% of Canadians consume peanut butter weekly. In the United States, peanuts and peanut butter are central to American dietary practices, and are typically considered as comfort foods. Peanuts were sold at fairs or by pushcart operators through the 19th century. Peanut butter is a common peanut-based food, representing half of the American total peanut consumption and $850 million in annual retail sales. Peanut soup is found on restaurant menus in the southeastern states. In some southern portions of the US, peanuts are boiled for several hours until soft and moist. Peanuts are also deep-fried, sometimes within the shell. Per person, Americans eat of peanut products annually, spending a total of $2 billion in peanut retail purchases.

=== Manufacturing ===
==== Production ====
In 2020, world production of peanuts (reported as groundnuts in shells) was 54 million tonnes, an 8% increase over 2019 production. China had 34% of global production, followed by India (19%). Other significant producers were Nigeria, the US, and Sudan.

==== Industrial ====
Peanuts have a variety of industrial end uses. Paint, varnish, lubricating oil, leather dressings, furniture polish, insecticides, and nitroglycerin are made from peanut oil. Soap is made from saponified oil, and many cosmetics contain peanut oil and its derivatives. The protein portion is used in the manufacture of some textile fibers. Peanut shells are used in the manufacture of plastic, wallboard, abrasives, fuel, cellulose (used in rayon and paper), and mucilage (glue).

=== Malnutrition ===
With their high protein concentration, peanuts are used to help fight malnutrition. Plumpy Nut, MANA Nutrition, and Medika Mamba are high-protein, high-energy, and high-nutrient peanut-based pastes developed to be used as a therapeutic food to aid in famine relief. The World Health Organization, UNICEF, Project Peanut Butter, and Doctors Without Borders have used these products to help save malnourished children in developing countries.

Peanuts can be used like other legumes and grains to make a lactose-free, milk-like beverage, peanut milk, which is promoted in Africa as a way to reduce malnutrition among children.

=== Animal feed ===

Peanut plant tops and crop residues can be used for silage.

The protein cake (oilcake meal) residue from oil processing is used as animal feed and soil fertilizer. Groundnut cake is a livestock feed, mostly used by cattle as protein supplements. It is one of the most important and valuable feeds for all types of livestock and one of the most active ingredients for poultry rations. Poor storage of the cake may sometimes result in its contamination by aflatoxin, a naturally occurring mycotoxin that is produced by &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot;. The major constituents of the cake are essential amino acids such as lysine and glutamine. Other components are crude fiber, crude protein, and fat.

Some peanuts can also be fed whole to livestock, for example, those over the peanut quota in the US or those with a higher aflatoxin content than that permitted by the food regulations.

Peanut processing often requires dehulling: the hulls generated in large amounts by the peanut industries can feed livestock, particularly ruminants.

<text>Haifa ( ; , ; ) is the third-largest city in Israel—after Jerusalem and Tel Aviv—with a population of in . The city of Haifa forms part of the Haifa metropolitan area, the third-most populous metropolitan area in Israel. It is home to the Baháʼí Faith&#x27;s Baháʼí World Centre, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a destination for Baháʼí pilgrimage.

Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel, the settlement has a history spanning more than 3,000 years. The earliest known settlement in the vicinity was Tell Abu Hawam, a small port city established in the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE). In the 3rd century CE, Haifa was known as a dye-making center. Over the millennia, the Haifa area has changed hands: being conquered and ruled by the Canaanites, Israelites, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, Ottomans, and the British. During the Battle of Haifa in the 1948 Palestine war, most of the city&#x27;s Arab population fled or were expelled. That year, the city became part of the then-newly-established state of Israel.

, the city is a major seaport located on Israel&#x27;s Mediterranean coastline in the Bay of Haifa covering . It lies about north of Tel Aviv and is the major regional center of northern Israel. Two respected academic institutions, the University of Haifa and the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology the oldest and top ranked university in both Israel and the Middle East, are located in Haifa, in addition to the largest K–12 school in Israel, the Hebrew Reali School. The city plays an important role in Israel&#x27;s economy. It is home to Matam, one of the oldest and largest high-tech parks in the country; and prior to the opening of Tel Aviv Light Rail, Haifa is the only city with underground rapid transit system in Israel known as the Carmelit. Haifa Bay is a center of heavy industry, petroleum refining and chemical processing. Haifa formerly functioned as the western terminus of an oil pipeline from Iraq via Jordan. It is one of Israel&#x27;s mixed cities, with an Arab-Israeli population of c.10%.

==Etymology==
The ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from the name of the high priest Caiaphas. Some Christians believe it was named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keipha. Another theory holds it could be derived from the Hebrew verb root חפה (&quot;hafa&quot;), from H-f-h root (ח-פ-ה), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa; others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word חוֹף (&quot;hof&quot;), meaning &quot;shore&quot;, or חוֹף יָפֶה (&quot;hof yafe&quot;), meaning &quot;beautiful shore&quot;.

Other spellings in English included &quot;Caipha&quot;, &quot;Kaipha&quot;, &quot;Caiffa&quot;, &quot;Kaiffa&quot; and &quot;Khaifa&quot;.

==Locations and names==
===Sycaminum and Efa===
The earliest named settlement within the area of modern-day Haifa was the city Sycaminum. The remains of the ancient town can be found in a coastal tell, or archaeological mound, known in Hebrew as , meaning &#x27;mound of the Ficus sycomorus&#x27;, and in Arabic as or , meaning &#x27;mound of the sumak trees&#x27;, names that preserved and transformed the ancient name, by which the town is mentioned once in the Mishnah (composed c. 200 CE) for the wild fruits that grow around it.

The name &quot;Efa&quot; first appears during Roman rule, some time after the end of the 1st century, when a Roman fortress and small Jewish settlement were established not far from Tel Shikmona. Haifa is also mentioned more than 100 times in the Talmud, a work central to Judaism.

&quot;Hefa&quot; or &quot;Hepha&quot; in Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s 4th-century work, &quot;Onomasticon&quot;, is said to be another name for Sycaminus. This synonymizing of the names is explained by Moshe Sharon, who writes that the twin ancient settlements, which he calls Haifa-Sycaminon, gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names Sycaminon or Sycaminos Polis. References to this city end with the Byzantine period.

===Porphyreon===
Around the 6th century, &quot;Porphyreon&quot; or &quot;Porphyrea&quot; is mentioned in the writings of William of Tyre, and while it lies within the area covered by modern Haifa, it was a settlement situated south of Haifa-Sycaminon.

===Early Muslim Haifa===
Following the Arab conquest in the 7th century, &quot;Haifa&quot; was used to refer to a site established on Tel Shikmona upon what were already the ruins of Sycaminon (Shiqmona). Haifa (or Haifah) is mentioned by the mid-11th-century Persian chronicler Nasir Khusraw, and the 12th- and 13th-century Arab chroniclers, Muhammad al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi. Nasir-i-Khusrau visited in 1047; he noted that &quot;Haifa lies on the seashore, and there are here palm-gardens and trees in numbers. There are in this town shipbuilders, who build very large craft.&quot;

===Crusader Caiphas===
The Crusaders, who captured Haifa briefly in the 12th century, called it &quot;Caiphas&quot;, and believe its name related to Cephas, the Aramaic name of Simon Peter. Eusebius is also said to have referred to Hefa as &quot;Caiaphas civitas&quot;, and Benjamin of Tudela, the 12th-century Jewish traveller and chronicler, is said to have attributed the city&#x27;s founding to Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest at the time of Jesus.

===Late Ottoman &quot;Old Haifa&quot;===
 (Arabic: &quot;Ancient Haifa&quot;) is another name used by some locals to refer to Tell es-Samak, when it was the site of a hamlet of 250 residents, before the settlement was moved in 1764–1765 to the site from which the modern city emerged.

===Haifa al-Jadida (New Haifa) and modern Haifa===
In 1764–1765 Zahir al-Umar moved the village to a new site to the east, which he also fortified. The new village, the nucleus of modern Haifa, was first called (Arabic: &quot;the new construction&quot;) by some, but others residing there called it (&quot;New Haifa&quot;) at first, and then simply &quot;Haifa&quot;.

In the early 20th century, Haifa al &#x27;Atiqa was repopulated with many Arab Christians in an overall neighborhood in which many Middle Eastern Jews were established inhabitants, as Haifa expanded outward from its new location.

==History==


===Bronze Age: Tell Abu Hawam===
A town known today as Tell Abu Hawam was established during the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE). It was a port and fishing village.

===In the Hebrew Bible===
Mount Carmel and the Kishon River are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

A grotto on the top of Mount Carmel is known as the &quot;Cave of Elijah&quot;, traditionally linked to the Prophet Elijah and his apprentice, Elisha. In Arabic, the highest peak of the Carmel range is called the &quot;Muhraka&quot;, or &quot;place of burning&quot;, harking back to the burnt offerings and sacrifices there in Canaanite and early Israelite times.

===Persian and Hellenistic period: near Shikmona===
In the sixth century BCE, during the Persian period, Greek geographer Scylax wrote of a city &quot;between the bay and the Promontory of Zeus&quot; (i.e., the Carmel), which may be a reference to Shikmona, a locality in the Haifa area.

By Hellenistic times, the city had moved to a new site south of what is now the Bat Galim neighborhood of modern Haifa because the old port&#x27;s harbour had become blocked with sand. A Greek-speaking population living along the coast at this time was engaged in commerce.

====Shikmona====
Haifa was located near the town of Shikmona, a center for making the traditional Tekhelet dye used in the garments of the high priests in the Temple. The archaeological site of Shikmona is southwest of Bat Galim.

Early Haifa is believed to have occupied the area which extends from the present-day Rambam Hospital to the Jewish Cemetery on Yafo Street. The inhabitants engaged in fishing and agriculture.

===Roman period===
In about the 3rd century CE, Haifa was first mentioned in Talmudic literature, as a Jewish fishing village and the home of Rabbi Avdimi and other Jewish scholars. According to the Talmud, fishermen caught Murex, sea snails which yielded purple dye used to make &quot;tallit&quot; (Jewish prayer shawls) from Haifa to the Ladder of the Tyrians. Tombs dating from the Roman era, including Jewish burial caves, have been found in the area.

===Byzantine period===
Under Byzantine rule, Haifa continued to grow but did not assume major importance. A &quot;kinah&quot; speaks of the destruction of the Jewish community of Haifa along with other communities when the Byzantines reconquered the country from the Sasanian Empire in 628 during the Byzantine-Sasanian War.

===Early Muslim period===
Following the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 630s–40s, Haifa was largely overlooked in favor of the port city of &#x27;Akka. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, Haifa began to develop.

In the 9th century under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, Haifa established trading relations with Egyptian ports and the city featured several shipyards. The inhabitants, Arabs and Jews, engaged in trade and maritime commerce. Glass production and dye-making from marine snails were the city&#x27;s most lucrative industries.

===Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk rule===

Prosperity ended in 1100 or 1101, when Haifa was besieged and blockaded by European Christians shortly after the end of the First Crusade, and then conquered after a fierce battle with its Jewish inhabitants and Fatimid garrison. Jews comprised the majority of the city&#x27;s population at the time. Under the Crusaders, Haifa was reduced to a small fortified coastal stronghold. It was a part of the Principality of Galilee within the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Following their victory at the Battle of Hattin, Saladin&#x27;s Ayyubid army captured Haifa in mid-July 1187 and the city&#x27;s Crusader fortress was destroyed. The Crusaders under Richard the Lionheart retook Haifa in 1191.

In the 12th century religious hermits started inhabiting the caves on Mount Carmel, and in the 13th century they formed a new Catholic monastic order, the Carmelites. Under Muslim rule, the church which they had built on Mount Carmel was turned into a mosque, later becoming a hospital. In the 19th century, it was restored as a Carmelite monastery, the Stella Maris Monastery. The altar of the church as we see it today, stands over a cave associated with Prophet Elijah.

In 1265, the army of Mamluk sultan Baibars captured Haifa, destroying its fortifications, which had been rebuilt by King Louis IX of France, as well as the majority of the city&#x27;s homes to prevent the European Crusaders from returning. From the time of its conquest by the Mamluks to the 15th century, Haifa was an unfortified small village or uninhabited. At various times there were a few Jews living there and both Jews and Christians made pilgrimages to the Cave of Elijah on Mount Carmel. During Mamluk rule in the 14th century, al-Idrisi wrote that Haifa served as the port for Tiberias and featured a &quot;fine harbor for the anchorage of galleys and other vessels.

===Ottoman period===

Haifa was apparently uninhabited at the time the Ottoman Empire conquered Palestine in 1516. The first indication of its resettlement was given in a description by German traveller Leonhard Rauwolf, who visited Palestine in 1575. In 1596, Haifa appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Sahil Atlit of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Lajjun. It had a population of 32 Muslim households and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, and goats or beehives. Haifa was subsequently mentioned in the accounts of travelers as a half-ruined impoverished village with few inhabitants. The expansion of commercial trade between Europe and Palestine in the 17th century saw Haifa&#x27;s revival as a flourishing port as more ships began docking there rather than Acre.

In 1742, Haifa was a small village and had a Jewish community composed mainly of immigrants from Morocco and Algeria which had a synagogue. It had 250 inhabitants in 1764–5. It was located at Tell el-Semak, the site of ancient Sycaminum.

In 1765, Zahir al-Umar, the Arab ruler of Acre and the Galilee, moved the population to a new fortified site to the east and laid waste to the old site. According to historian Moshe Sharon, the new Haifa was established by Zahir in 1769. This event marked the beginning of modern Haifa. After al-Umar&#x27;s death in 1775, the town remained under Ottoman rule until 1918, with the exception of two brief periods.

In 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Haifa during his unsuccessful campaign to conquer Palestine and Syria, but he soon had to withdraw; in the campaign&#x27;s final proclamation, Napoleon took credit for having razed the fortifications of &quot;Kaïffa&quot; (as the name was spelled at the time) along with those of Gaza, Jaffa and Acre.
Between 1831 and 1840, the Egyptian viceroy Muhammad Ali governed Haifa, after his son Ibrahim Pasha had wrested control over it from the Ottomans. When the Egyptian occupation ended and Acre declined, the importance of Haifa rose. In 1858, the walled city of Haifa was overcrowded and the first houses began to be built outside the city walls on the mountain slope. The British Survey of Western Palestine estimated Haifa&#x27;s population to be about 3,000 in 1859.

Haifa remained majority Muslim throughout this time but a small Jewish community continued to exist there. In 1798, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov spent Rosh HaShana with the Jewish community of Haifa. In 1839 the Jewish population numbered 124. Due to the growing influence of the Carmelite monks, Haifa&#x27;s Christian population also grew. By 1840 approximately 40% of the inhabitants were Christian Arabs.
The arrival of German messianics, many of whom were Templers, in 1868, who settled in what is now known as the German Colony, was a turning point in Haifa&#x27;s development. The Templers built and operated a steam-based power station, opened factories and inaugurated carriage services to Acre, Nazareth and Tiberias, playing a key role in modernizing the city.
The first major wave of Jewish immigration to Haifa took place in the mid-19th century from Morocco, with a smaller wave of immigration from Turkey a few years later. In the 1870s, large numbers of Jewish and Arab migrants came to Haifa due to the town&#x27;s growing prosperity. Jews constituted one-eighth of Haifa&#x27;s population, almost all of whom were recent immigrants from Morocco and Turkey who lived in the Jewish Quarter, which was located in the eastern part of the town. Continued Jewish immigration gradually raised the Jewish population of Haifa, and included a small number of Ashkenazi families, most of whom opened hotels for Jewish migrants coming into the city. In 1875, the Jewish community of Haifa held its own census which counted the Jewish population at about 200. The First Aliyah of the late 19th century and the Second Aliyah of the early 20th century saw Jewish immigrants, mainly from Eastern Europe, arrive in Haifa in significant numbers. In particular, a significant number of Jewish immigrants from Romania settled in Haifa in the 1880s during the First Aliyah period. The Central Jewish Colonisation Society in Romania purchased over near Haifa. As the Jewish settlers had been city dwellers, they hired the former fellahin tenants to instruct them in agriculture. The Jewish population rose from 1,500 in 1900 to 3,000 on the eve of World War I.

In the early 20th century, Haifa began to emerge as an industrial port city and growing population center. A branch of the Hejaz Railway, known as the Jezreel Valley railway, was built between 1903 and 1905. The railway increased the city&#x27;s volume of trade, and attracted workers and foreign merchants. In 1912, construction began on the Technion Institute of Technology, a Jewish technical school that was to later become one of Israel&#x27;s top universities, although studies did not begin until 1924. The Jews of Haifa also founded numerous factories and cultural institutions.

==== Baháʼí faith&#x27;s shrine ====
In 1909, Haifa became important to the Baháʼí Faith when the remains of the Báb, founder of the Bábí Faith and forerunner of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh in the Baháʼí Faith, were moved from Acre to Haifa and interred in the shrine built on Mount Carmel. Baháʼís consider the shrine to be their second holiest place on Earth after the Shrine of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh in Acre. Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh himself to his eldest son, ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, in 1891. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá planned the structure, which was designed and completed several years later by his grandson, Shoghi Effendi. In a separate room, the remains of ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá were buried in November 1921.

===British Mandate===


Haifa was captured from the Ottomans in September 1918 by Indian horsemen of the British Army armed with spears and swords who overran Ottoman positions. On 22 September, British troops were heading to Nazareth when a reconnaissance report was received indicating that the Turks were leaving Haifa. The British made preparations to enter the city and came under fire in the Balad al-Sheikh district (today Nesher). After the British regrouped, an elite unit of Indian horsemen were sent to attack the Turkish positions on the flanks and overrun their artillery guns on Mount Carmel.

Under the British Mandate, Haifa saw large-scale development and became an industrial port city. The Baháʼí Faith in 1918 and today has its administrative and spiritual centre in the environs of Haifa. Many Jewish immigrants of the Fourth Aliyah and Fifth Aliyah settled in Haifa. The port was a major source of income, and the nearby Jewish towns of the Krayot were established in the 1930s. At the same time, the Arab population also swelled by an influx of migrants, coming mainly from surrounding villages as well as the Syrian Hauran. The Arab immigration mainly came as a result of prices and salary drop. The 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British authorities, recorded Haifa&#x27;s population as 24,634 (9,377 Muslims, 8,863 Christians, 6,230 Jews, 152 Baha&#x27;i, and 12 Druze). By the time of the 1931 census of Palestine, this had increased to 50,403 (20,324 Muslims, 15,923 Jews, 13,824 Christians, 196 Baha&#x27;i, 126 Druze, and 10 with no religion). Between the censuses of 1922 and 1931, the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian populations rose by 217%, 256%, and 156%, respectively. In 1938, 99,000 people (including 48,000 Jews) lived in Haifa.

Haifa&#x27;s development owed much to British plans to make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country&#x27;s heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization. The State-run Palestine Railways also built its main workshops in Haifa.

By 1945 the population was 138,300 (75,500 Jews, 35,940 Muslims, 26,570 Christians, and 290 &quot;other&quot;). In 1947, about 70,910 Arabs (41,000 Muslims and 29,910 Christians) and 74,230 Jews were living there. The Christian community were mostly Greek-Melkite Catholics.

===1947–1948 Civil War in Palestine===

The 1947 UN Partition Plan in late November 1947 designated Haifa as part of the proposed Jewish state. Arab protests over that decision evolved into violence between Jews and Arabs that left several dozen people dead during December. The Arab city was in a state of chaos. The local Arab national committee tried to stabilize the situation by organizing garrison, calming the frightened residents and to stop the flight. In a public statement, the national committee called upon the Arab residents to obey orders, be alert, keep calm, and added: &quot;Keep away the cowards who wish to flee. Expell them from your lines. Despise them, because they harm more than the enemy&quot;. Despite the efforts, Arab residents abandoned the streets which bordered Jewish neighborhoods and during the days of the general strike instigated by the Arab Higher Committee, some 250 Arab families abandoned the Khalisa neighborhood.

On 30 December 1947, members of the Irgun, a Jewish underground militia, threw bombs into a crowd of Arabs outside the gates of the Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42. In response, Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in what became known as the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre. The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre.

British forces in Haifa redeployed on 21 April 1948, withdrawing from most of the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. According to Ilan Pappé, although the Jewish mayor of the city, Shabtai Levy, urged the Arab residents to stay, in other parts of town loudspeakers could be heard ordering Arabs to leave &quot;before it&#x27;s too late.&quot;

On 21 April, the downtown, controlled by a combination of local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars, was assaulted by Jewish forces in Operation Bi&#x27;ur Hametz by the Carmeli Brigade of the Haganah, commanded by Moshe Carmel. Arab neighborhoods were attacked with mortars and gunfire, which, according to Ilan Pappé, culminated in an attack on a Palestinian crowd in the old marketplace using three-inch (76 mm) mortars on 22 April 1948.

Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim, a Palestinian Arab municipal leader, described attacks &quot;provoking terror among the women and children, who were very influenced by &quot;, and provided an eyewitness account of the flight of Haifa&#x27;s Arab residents:

The operation led to a massive displacement of Haifa&#x27;s Arab population, and was part of the larger 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight. According to &quot;The Economist&quot; at the time, only 5,000–6,000 of the city&#x27;s 62,000 Arabs remained there by 2 October 1948. Morris quotes British sources as stating that during the battles between 22 and 23 April 100 Arabs were killed and 100 wounded, but he adds that the total may have been higher.

Historian Walid Khalidi described &quot;the mass exodus of Haifa’s Arab population&quot; as &quot;the spontaneous reaction to the ruthless combination of terror and psychological warfare tactics adopted by the Haganah during the attack.&quot;

===State of Israel===
After the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 Haifa became the gateway for Jewish immigration into Israel. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them Kiryat Hayim, Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and Kiryat Eliezer. Bnei Zion Hospital (formerly Rothschild Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in Hadar HaCarmel date from this period. In 1953, a master plan was created for transportation and the future architectural layout. In 1959, a group of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, mostly Moroccan Jews, rioted in Wadi Salib, claiming the state was discriminating against them. Their demand for &quot;bread and work&quot; was directed at the state institutions and what they viewed as an Ashkenazi elite in the Labor Party and the Histadrut.

Tel Aviv gained in status, while Haifa suffered a decline in the role as regional capital. The opening of Ashdod as a port exacerbated this. Tourism shrank when the Israeli Ministry of Tourism placed emphasis on developing Tiberias as a tourist centre. Nevertheless, Haifa&#x27;s population had reached 200,000 by the early 1970s, and mass immigration from the former Soviet Union boosted the population by a further 35,000. The Matam high-tech park, the first dedicated high-tech park in Israel, opened in Haifa in the 1970s. Many of Wadi Salib&#x27;s historic Ottoman buildings have now been demolished, and in the 1990s a major section of the Old City was razed to make way for a new municipal center.

From 1999 to 2003, several Palestinian suicide attacks took place in Haifa (in Maxim and Matza restaurants, bus 37, and others), killing 68 civilians. In 2006, Haifa was hit by 93 Hezbollah rockets during the Second Lebanon War, killing 11 civilians and leading to half of the city&#x27;s population fleeing at the end of the first week of the war. Among the places hit by rockets were a train depot and the oil refinery complex.

==Demographics==
Haifa is Israel&#x27;s third-largest city, consisting of 103,000 households, or a population of . Immigrants from the former Soviet Union constitute 25% of Haifa&#x27;s population, thus making Russian one of the three main spoken languages of the city.

According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, Israeli Arabs constitute 10% of Haifa&#x27;s population, the majority living in the Wadi Nisnas, Abbas and Khalisa neighborhoods. The Wadi Nisnas and Abbas neighborhoods are largely Christian, Khalisa and Kababir are largely Muslim, while Ein HaYam is a mixed Arab Christian and Muslim neighborhood. Haifa is commonly portrayed as a model of co-existence between Arabs and Jews, although tensions and hostility do still exist.

Between 1994 and 2009, the city had a declining and aging population compared to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as young people moved to the center of the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.

A development plan approved in 2016 seeks to raise Haifa&#x27;s population to 330,000 residents by 2025.

===Religious and ethnic communities===
The population is heterogeneous. Israeli Jews comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the majority of whom are Arab Christians) and, some 4% are Muslims. Haifa also includes Druze and Baháʼí Faith communities. In 2006, 27% of the Arab population was aged 14 and under, compared to 17% of the Jewish and other population groups. The trend continues in the age 15–29 group, in which 27% of the Arab population is found, and the age 30–44 group (23%). The population of Jews and others in these age groups are 22% and 18% respectively. Nineteen percent of the city&#x27;s Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the Arab population. This continues with 14% of Jews and others aged 60–74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population. Arabs in Haifa tend to be wealthier and better educated compare to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel.

Haifa is home to the second-largest Arab Christian community in Israel, many of them lives in the Arabic-speaking neighborhoods in the lowlands near the sea; neighborhoods such as German Colony, Wadi Nisnas and Abbas, are largely Arab Christian. There are also a significant number of wealthy Christian Arabs in the Hadar West and Central. The Christian communities of Haifa are varied and included various denominations, the most prominent among them the Melkite Greek Catholic, followed by Greek Orthodox, Latin Catholics, Maronites, Armenian Orthodox, and Protestants. The Christian Arab communities in Haifa tend to be wealthier and better educated compare to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel. The Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Akka is based in Haifa, and its cathedral episcopal see is St. Elijah Greek-Melkite Cathedral.

Following Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, some former South Lebanon Army soldiers and officers who fled from Lebanon settled in Haifa with their families.

In 2006, 2.9% of the Jews in the city were Haredi, compared to 7.5% on a national scale. However, the Haredi community in Haifa is growing fast due to a high fertility rate. 66.6% were secular, compared to a national average of 43.7%. There is also a Scandinavian Seamen Protestant church, established by Norwegian Righteous Among the Nations pastor Per Faye-Hansen.

Haifa is the center of liberal Arabic-speaking culture, as it was under British colonial rule. The Arabic-speaking neighborhoods, which are mixed Muslim and Christian, are in the lowlands near the sea, while Jewish neighborhoods are at a higher elevation. An active Arab cultural life has developed in the 21st century. The city is the center of many Arab-owned businesses such as theaters, bars, cafes, restaurants and nightclubs which also host different cultural discussions and art exhibitions.

==Geography==
Haifa is situated on the Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain, the historic land bridge between Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the mouth of the Kishon River. Located on the northern slopes of Mount Carmel and around Haifa Bay, the city is split over three tiers. The lowest is the center of commerce and industry including the Port of Haifa. The middle level is on the slopes of Mount Carmel and consists of older residential neighborhoods, while the upper level consists of modern neighborhoods looking over the lower tiers. From here views can be had across the Western Galilee region of Israel towards Rosh HaNikra and the Lebanese border. Haifa is about north of the city of Tel Aviv, and has a large number of beaches on the Mediterranean.

===Flora and fauna===
The Carmel Mountain has three main wadis: Lotem, Amik and Si&#x27;ach. For the most part these valleys are undeveloped natural corridors that run up through the city from the coast to the top of the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, golden jackal, hyrax, Egyptian mongoose, owls and chameleons.

Haifa is inundated with boars. The boars began to descend from the valleys around the city from before 2019, and began to roam in the city&#x27;s streets. In 2019, mayor Einat Kalisch-Rotem decided to stop shooting the boars. Boar sighting figures have struggled to go down since the Israel Nature and Parks Authority began fencing off forested areas, because residents often feed the boars.

===Climate===
Haifa has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;). Spring arrives in March when temperatures begin to increase. By late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. The average temperature in summer is and in winter, . Frost is rare in Haifa, but temperatures around can sometimes occur, usually in the early morning. Snow is very rare, which last fell in 1950. Humidity tends to be high all year round, and rain usually occurs between September and May. Annual precipitation is approximately .

==Neighborhoods==


Haifa has developed in tiers, from the lower to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part to make way for Government Buildings. Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.

The first buildings in Hadar were constructed at the start of the 20th century. Hadar was Haifa&#x27;s cultural center and marketplace throughout the 1920s and into the 1980s, nestled above and around Haifa&#x27;s Arab neighborhoods. Today Hadar stretches from the port area near the bay, approximately halfway up Mount Carmel, around the German Colony, Wadi Nisnas and Wadi Salib. Hadar houses two commercial centers (one in the port area, and one midway up the mountain) surrounded by some of the city&#x27;s older neighborhoods.

Neve Sha&#x27;anan, a neighborhood located on the second tier of Mount Carmel, was founded in the 1920s. West of the port are the neighborhoods of Bat Galim, Shikmona Beach, and Kiryat Eliezer. To the west and east of Hadar are the Arab neighborhoods of Abbas and Khalisa, built in the 1960s and 70s. To the south of Mount Carmel&#x27;s headland, along the road to Tel Aviv, are the neighborhoods of Ein HaYam, Shaar HaAliya, Kiryat Sprinzak and Neve David.

Above Hadar are affluent neighborhoods such as the Carmel Tzarfati (French Carmel), Merkaz HaCarmel (Carmel Center), Romema (Ramot Ben Gurion), Ahuzat HaCarmel (Ahuza), Carmeliya, Vardiya, Ramat Golda, Ramat Alon and Hod Ha&#x27;Carmel (Denya). While there are general divisions between Arab and Jewish neighborhoods, there is an increasing trend for wealthy Arabs to move into affluent Jewish neighborhoods. Another Carmel neighborhood is Kababir, home to the National Headquarters of Israel&#x27;s Ahmadiyya Community; located near Merkaz HaCarmel and overlooking the coast.

==Urban development==
Recently, residential construction has been concentrated around Kiryat Haim and Kiryat Shmuel, with of new residential construction between 2002 and 2004, the Carmel, with , and Ramot Neve Sha&#x27;anan with approximately Non-residential construction was highest in the Lower Town, (90,000 sq m), Haifa Bay (72,000 sq m) and Ramot Neve Sha&#x27;anan (54,000 sq m). In 2004, 80% of construction in the city was private.

Currently, the city has a modest number of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings. Though buildings rising up to 20 stories were built on Mount Carmel in the past, the Haifa municipality banned the construction of any new buildings taller than nine stories on Mount Carmel in July 2012.

The neighborhood of Wadi Salib, located in the heart of downtown Haifa, is being redeveloped. Most of its Jewish and Arab residents are considered squatters and have been gradually evicted over the years. The Haifa Economic Corporation Ltd is developing two 1,000 square meter lots for office and commercial use. Some historic buildings have been renovated and redeveloped, especially into nightclubs and theaters, such as the Palace of the Pasha, a Turkish bathhouse, and a Middle Eastern music and dance club, which has been converted into theaters and offices.

In 2012, a new, massive development plan was announced for Haifa&#x27;s waterfront. According to the plan, the western section of the city&#x27;s port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The west side of the port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently bisect the city and separate the city&#x27;s beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries&#x27; cooling towers will be turned into a visitors&#x27; center, and bridges will lead from the port to the rest of the city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa&#x27;s lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city&#x27;s business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.
Another plan seeks to turn the western section of Haifa Port into a major tourism and nightlife center, as well as a functioning point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel. All port activity will be moved to the western side, and the area will be redeveloped. Public spaces and a beach promenade will be developed, and commercial buildings will be renovated. As part of the development plans, the Israeli Navy, which has a large presence in Haifa, will withdraw from the shoreline between Bat Galim and Hof Hashaket. A long esplanade which will encircle the shoreline will be constructed. It will include a bicycle path, and possibly also a small bridge under which navy vessels will pass on their way to the sea.

In addition, a 50,000 square-meter entertainment complex that will contain a Disney theme park, cinemas, shops, and a 25-screen Multiplex theater will be built at the Check Post exit from the Carmel Tunnels. In 2014, a new major plan for the city was proposed, under which extensive development of residential, business, and leisure areas will take place with the target of increasing the city&#x27;s population by 60,000 by 2025. Under the plan, five new neighborhoods will be built, along with new high-tech parks. In addition, existing employment centers will be renovated, and new leisure areas and a large park will be built.

In 2016, a new plan for the city was approved. The plan included a new main downtown business district, the creation of a park in a current industrial area, new construction and renovation of public buildings and hubs of higher education, tourism, culture, commerce, leisure, and residence.

==Economy==
The common Israeli saying, &quot;Haifa works, Jerusalem prays, and Tel Aviv plays&quot; attests to Haifa&#x27;s reputation as a city of workers and industry. The industrial region of Haifa is in the eastern part of the city, around the Kishon River. It is home to the Haifa oil refinery, one of the two oil refineries in Israel (the other refinery being located in Ashdod). The Haifa refinery processes 9 million tons (66 million barrels) of crude oil a year. Its nowadays unused twin 80-meter high cooling towers, built in the 1930s, were the tallest buildings built in the British Mandate period. &quot;Matam&quot; (short for &quot;Merkaz Ta&#x27;asiyot Mada&quot; – Scientific Industries Center), the largest and oldest business park in Israel, is at the southern entrance to the city, hosting manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities for a large number of Israeli and international hi-tech companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Abbot, Cadence, Intel, IBM, Magic Leap, Microsoft, Motorola, Google, Yahoo!, Elbit, CSR, Philips, PwC and Amdocs. The campus of the University of Haifa is also home to IBM Haifa Labs.

The Port of Haifa is the leader in passenger traffic among Israeli ports, and is also a major cargo harbor, although deregulation has seen its dominance challenged by the Port of Ashdod. Haifa malls and shopping centers include Hutsot Hamifratz, Horev Center Mall, Panorama Center, Castra Center, Colony Center (Lev HaMoshava), Hanevi&#x27;im Tower Mall, Kanyon Haifa, Lev Hamifratz Mall and Grand Kanyon. In 2010, &quot;Monocle&quot; magazine identified Haifa as the city with the most promising business potential, with the greatest investment opportunities in the world. The magazine noted that &quot;a massive head-to-toe regeneration is starting to have an impact; from scaffolding and cranes around town, to renovated façades and new smart places to eat&quot;. The Haifa municipality had spent more than $350 million on roads and infrastructure, and the number of building permits had risen 83% in the previous two years.

In 2014, it was announced that a technology-focused stock exchange would be established to compete with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Currently, some 40 hotels, mostly boutique hotels, are planned, have been approved, or are under construction. The Haifa Municipality is seeking to turn the city into Northern Israel&#x27;s tourist center, from where travelers can embark on day trips into Acre, Nazareth, Tiberias, and the Galilee. A new life sciences industrial park containing five buildings with 85,000 square meters of space on a 31-duman (7.75 acre) site is being built adjacent to the Matam industrial park.

===Tourism===
In 2005, Haifa had 13 hotels with a total of 1,462 rooms. The city has a shoreline, of which are beaches. Haifa&#x27;s main tourist attraction is the Baháʼí World Centre, with the golden-domed Shrine of the Báb and the surrounding gardens. Between 2005 and 2006, 86,037 visited the shrine. In 2008, the Baháʼí gardens were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The restored German Colony, founded by the Templers, Stella Maris and Elijah&#x27;s Cave also draw many tourists. Located in the Haifa district are the Ein Hod artists&#x27; colony, where over 90 artists and craftsmen have studios and exhibitions, and the Mount Carmel national park, with caves where Neanderthal and early Homo Sapiens remains were found.

A 2007 report commissioned by the Haifa Municipality calls for the construction of more hotels, a ferry line between Haifa, Acre and Caesarea, development of the western anchorage of the port as a recreation and entertainment area, and an expansion of the local airport and port to accommodate international travel and cruise ships.

==Arts and culture==
Despite its image as a port and industrial city, Haifa is the cultural hub of northern Israel. During the 1950s, mayor Abba Hushi made a special effort to encourage authors and poets to move to the city, and founded the Haifa Theatre, a repertory theater, the first municipal theater founded in the country. The principal Arabic theater servicing the northern Arab population is the al-Midan Theater. Other theaters in the city include the Krieger Centre for the Performing Arts and the Rappaport Art and Culture Center. The Congress Center hosts exhibitions, concerts and special events.

The New Haifa Symphony Orchestra, established in 1950, has more than 5,000 subscribers. In 2004, 49,000 people attended its concerts. The Haifa Cinematheque, founded in 1975, hosts the annual Haifa International Film Festival during the intermediate days of the Sukkot holiday. Haifa has 29 movie theaters. The city publishes a local newspaper, Yediot Haifa, and has its own radio station, Radio Haifa.רדיו חיפה – 107.5FM The Israeli Arabic-language newspapers Al-Ittihad and Al-Madina are also based in Haifa. During the 1990s, Haifa hosted the Haifa Rock &amp; Blues Festival featuring Bob Dylan, Nick Cave, Blur and PJ Harvey. The last festival was held in 1995 with Sheryl Crow, Suede and Faith No More as headliners.

===Museums===

Haifa has over a dozen museums. The most popular museum is the Israel National Museum of Science, Technology, and Space, which recorded almost 150,000 visitors in 2004. The museum is located in the historic Technion building in the Hadar neighborhood. The Haifa Museum of Art houses a collection of modern and classical art, as well as displays on the history of Haifa. The Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art is the only museum in the Middle East dedicated solely to Japanese art. Other museums in Haifa include the Museum of Prehistory, the National Maritime Museum and Haifa City Museum, the Hecht Museum, the Dagon Archaeological Museum of Grain Handling, the Railway Museum, the Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum, the Israeli Oil Industry Museum, and Chagall Artists&#x27; House. As part of his campaign to bring culture to Haifa, Mayor Abba Hushi provided the artist Mane-Katz with a building on Mount Carmel to house his collection of Judaica, which is now a museum. The former home and studio of artist Hermann Struck is now the Hermann Struck Museum. The Haifa Educational Zoo at Gan HaEm park houses a small animal collection including Syrian brown bears, now extinct from Israel. Wןthin the zoo is the Pinhas House biology institute. In the close vicinity of Haifa, on the Carmel, the Northern &quot;Hai-Bar&quot; (&quot;wild life&quot;) operated by Israel&#x27;s Parks and Reserves Authority for the purpose of breeding and reintroduction of species now extinct from Israel, such as Persian Fallow Deer.

==Government==
As an industrial port city, Haifa has traditionally been a Labor party stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions earned it the nickname &#x27;Red Haifa.&#x27; In addition, many prominent Arabs in the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. There has been a drift toward the center. This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor lagging behind with 16.9%. Before 1948, Haifa&#x27;s Municipality was fairly unusual as it developed cooperation between the mixed Arab and Jewish community in the city, with representatives of both groups involved in the city&#x27;s management. Under mayor al-Haj, between 1920 and 1927, the city council had six Arab and two Jewish representatives, with the city run as a mixed municipality with overall Arab control. Greater cooperation was introduced under Hasan Bey Shukri, who adopted a positive and conciliatory attitude toward the city&#x27;s Jews and gave them senior posts in the municipality. In 1940, the first Jewish mayor, Shabtai Levy, was elected. Levy&#x27;s two deputies were Arab (one Muslim, the other Christian), with the remainder of the council made up of four Jews and six Arabs.

Today, Haifa is governed by its 12th city council, headed by the mayor Einat Kalisch-Rotem. The results of municipal elections decide on the makeup of the council, similarly to the Knesset elections. The city council is the legislative council in the city, and has the authority to pass auxiliary laws. The 12th council, which was elected in 2003, has 31 members, with the liberal Shinui-Greens ticket holding the most seats (6), and Likud coming second with 5. Many of the decisions passed by the city council are results of recommendation made by the various municipal committees, which are committees where non-municipal organs meet with representatives from the city council. Some committees are spontaneous, but some are mandatory, such as the security committee, tender committee and financial committee.

Bnai Zion Medical Center and Carmel Hospital each have 400 beds. Other hospitals in the city include the Italian Hospital, Elisha Hospital (100 beds), Horev Medical Center (36 beds) and Ramat Marpe (18 beds). Haifa has 20 family health centers. In 2004, there were a total of 177,478 hospital admissions. Rambam Medical Center was in the direct line of fire during the Second Lebanon War in 2006 and was forced to take special precautions to protect its patients. Whole wings of the hospital were moved to large underground shelters.

==Education==

Haifa is home to two internationally acclaimed universities and several colleges. The University of Haifa, founded in 1963, is at the top of Mt. Carmel. The campus was designed by the architect of Brasília and United Nations Headquarters in New York City, Oscar Niemeyer. The top floor of the 30-story Eshkol Tower provides a panoramic view of northern Israel. The Hecht Museum, with important archeology and art collections, is on the campus of Haifa University.

The Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, was founded in 1912, and became the first higher education institution where the language of teaching is Hebrew (see War of the Languages). It has 18 faculties and 42 research institutes. The original building now houses Israel National Museum of Science, Technology, and Space, also known as Madatech.

The Hebrew Reali School was founded in 1913. It is the largest k-12 school in Israel, with 4,000 students in 7 branches, all over the city.

The first technological high school in Israel, Bosmat, was established in Haifa in 1933. It was affiliated with the Technion. Because of financial difficulties, it was closed in 2007, and later re-established as part of the Mofet network, which was started by science teachers from the 1990s post-Soviet aliyah.

Other academic institutions in Haifa are the Gordon College of Education and Sha&#x27;anan Religious Teachers&#x27; College, the WIZO Haifa Academy of Design and Education, and Tiltan College of Design. The Michlala Leminhal College of Management and the Open University of Israel have branches in Haifa. The city also has a nursing college and the P.E.T Practical Engineering School.

Among Israeli higher education institutions the University of Haifa has the largest percentage (41%) of Arab-Israeli students. The Technion Israel Institute of Technology has the second largest percentage (22.2%) of Arab-Israeli students.

–07, Haifa had 70 elementary schools, 23 middle schools, 28 academic high schools and 8 vocational high schools. There were 5,133 pupils in municipal kindergartens, 20,081 in elementary schools, 7,911 in middle schools, 8,072 in academic high schools, 2,646 in vocational high schools, and 2,068 in comprehensive district high schools. 86% of the students attended Hebrew-speaking schools and 14% attended Arab schools. 5% were in special education. In 2004, Haifa had 16 municipal libraries stocking 367,323 books. Two prestigious Arab schools in Haifa are the Orthodox School, run by the Greek Orthodox church, and the Nazareth Nuns&#x27; School, a Catholic institution. About 70% of Arab students in Haifa (Christians, Muslims, and Druze) attend Christian schools (6 schools) that found in the city.

==Transportation==
===Public transportation===

Haifa is served by six railway stations and the Carmelit, currently Israel&#x27;s only subway system (another is planned in Tel Aviv). The Nahariya–Tel Aviv Coastal Railway main line of Israel Railways runs along the coast of the Gulf of Haifa and has six stations within the city. From south-west to north-east, these stations are: Haifa Hof HaCarmel, Haifa Bat Galim, Haifa Merkaz HaShmona, HaMifrats Central, Hutzot HaMifratz and Kiryat Haim. Together with the Kiryat Motzkin Railway Station in the northern suburb Kiryat Motzkin, they form the Haifa – Krayot suburban line (&quot;Parvarit&quot;). There are direct trains from Haifa to Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport, Beersheba, Hadera, Herzliya, Modi&#x27;in, Nahariya, Karmiel, Akko, Kiryat Motzkin, Binyamina, Lod, Ramla, Beit Shemesh and others.

Haifa&#x27;s intercity bus connections are operated almost exclusively by the Egged bus company, which operates two terminals:
* HaMifratz Central Bus Station, adjacent to the HaMifrats Central Railway Station
* Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station, adjacent to the Hof HaCarmel Railway Station
Lines to the North of the country use HaMifratz Central Bus Station and their coverage includes most towns in the North of Israel. Lines heading south use Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station.

Destinations directly reachable from Hof HaCarmel CBS include Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Eilat, Raanana, Netanya, Hadera, Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov, Atlit, Tirat Carmel, Ben Gurion International Airport and intermediate communities. There are also three Egged lines that have their terminus in the Ramat Vizhnitz neighborhood and run to Jerusalem, Bnei Brak and Ashdod. These used to be &quot;mehadrin&quot; (i.e. gender segregated) lines.

All urban lines are run by Egged. There are also share taxis that run along some bus routes but do not have an official schedule. In 2006, Haifa implemented a trial network of neighborhood mini-buses – named &quot;Shkhunatit&quot; and run by Egged. In December 2012, GetTaxi, an app and taxi service which allows users to hail a cab using their smartphone without contacting the taxi station (by identifying and summoning the closest taxi) began operating. In the current initial phase, 50 taxis from the service are operating in Haifa.

Haifa and the Krayot suburbs also have a new Phileas concept bus rapid transit system called the Metronit. These buses, operating with hybrid engines, follow optical strips embedded in designated lanes of roads, providing tram-like public transportation services. The Metronit consists of 100 18-meter buses, each with the capacity for 150 passengers, operating along of designated roadways. The new system officially opened on 16 August 2013 serving three lines.

Haifa is one of the few cities in Israel where buses operate on Shabbat. Bus lines operate throughout the city on a reduced schedule from late Saturday morning onwards, and also connect Haifa with Nesher, Tirat Karmel, Yokneam, Nazareth, Nazareth Illit and intermediate communities. Since the summer of 2008, night buses are operated by Egged in Haifa (line 200) and the Krayot suburbs (line 210). During the summer of 2008 these lines operated 7 nights a week. Since 2013, along with route 1 of the Metronit, they operate 7 nights a week, making Haifa as the only city in Israel with 24/7 public transportation. Haifa is also the only city in Israel to operate a Saturday bus service to the beaches during summer time. Egged lines run during Saturday mornings from many neighborhoods to the Dado and Bat Galim beaches, and back in the afternoon.
The Haifa subway system is called Carmelit. It is a subterranean funicular railway, running from downtown Paris Square to Gan HaEm (Mother&#x27;s Park) on Mount Carmel. With a single track, six stations and two trains, it is listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s shortest metro line. The Carmelit accommodates bicycles.

Haifa also has two cable cars. The Bat Galim cable car consists of six cabins and connects Bat Galim on the coast to the Stella Maris observation deck and monastery atop Mount Carmel. It serves mainly tourists. Opened in April 2022, Rakavlit, the second cable car, is a 4.4-kilometre commuter cable car service, running from HaMifratz Central Bus Station at the foot of Mount Carmel to the Technion, and then to the University of Haifa.

===Air and sea transport===

Haifa Airport serves international charters to Cyprus (Larnaca and Paphos). Before COVID-19 pandemic Haifa Airport operated flights to Egypt, Greece, Jordan and Turkey as well as domestic flights to Tel Aviv (Sde Dov Airport) and Eilat (Eilat Airport).

There are currently plans to expand services from Haifa.

airHaifa is planning to launch operations during September 2024, when at the beginning it will issue flights on the Haifa-Eilat route and later it will also fly to Cyprus, Greece and Turkey.

===Roads===
Travel between Haifa and the center of the country is possible by road with Highway 2, the main highway along the coastal plain, beginning at Tel Aviv and ending at Haifa. Furthermore, Highway 4 runs along the coast to the north of Haifa, as well as south, inland from Highway 2. In the past, traffic along Highway 2 to the north of Haifa had to pass through the downtown area of the city. The Carmel Tunnels, opened for traffic 1 December 2010, now route this traffic under Mount Carmel, reducing congestion in the downtown area.

<text>In mathematics, the discriminant of a polynomial is a quantity that depends on the coefficients and allows deducing some properties of the roots without computing them. More precisely, it is a polynomial function of the coefficients of the original polynomial. The discriminant is widely used in polynomial factoring, number theory, and algebraic geometry.

The discriminant of the quadratic polynomial formula_1 is
:formula_2
the quantity which appears under the square root in the quadratic formula. If formula_3 this discriminant is zero if and only if the polynomial has a double root. In the case of real coefficients, it is positive if the polynomial has two distinct real roots, and negative if it has two distinct complex conjugate roots. Similarly, the discriminant of a cubic polynomial is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root. In the case of a cubic with real coefficients, the discriminant is positive if the polynomial has three distinct real roots, and negative if it has one real root and two distinct complex conjugate roots. 

More generally, the discriminant of a univariate polynomial of positive degree is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root. For real coefficients and no multiple roots, the discriminant is positive if the number of non-real roots is a multiple of 4 (including none), and negative otherwise.

Several generalizations are also called discriminant: the &quot;discriminant of an algebraic number field&quot;; the &quot;discriminant of a quadratic form&quot;; and more generally, the &quot;discriminant&quot; of a form, of a homogeneous polynomial, or of a projective hypersurface (these three concepts are essentially equivalent).

==Origin==
The term &quot;discriminant&quot; was coined in 1851 by the British mathematician James Joseph Sylvester.

==Definition==

Let 
:formula_4
be a polynomial of degree (this means formula_5), such that the coefficients formula_6 belong to a field, or, more generally, to a commutative ring. The resultant of and its derivative, 
:formula_7 
is a polynomial in formula_6 with integer coefficients, which is the determinant of the Sylvester matrix of and . The nonzero entries of the first column of the Sylvester matrix are formula_9 and formula_10 and the resultant is thus a multiple of formula_11 Hence the discriminant—up to its sign—is defined as the quotient of the resultant of and by formula_9:

:formula_13

Historically, this sign has been chosen such that, over the reals, the discriminant will be positive when all the roots of the polynomial are real. The division by formula_9 may not be well defined if the ring of the coefficients contains zero divisors. Such a problem may be avoided by replacing formula_9 by 1 in the first column of the Sylvester matrix—&quot;before&quot; computing the determinant. In any case, the discriminant is a polynomial in formula_6 with integer coefficients.

===Expression in terms of the roots===
When the above polynomial is defined over a field, it has roots, formula_17, not necessarily all distinct, in any algebraically closed extension of the field. (If the coefficients are real numbers, the roots may be taken in the field of complex numbers, where the fundamental theorem of algebra applies.) 

In terms of the roots, the discriminant is equal to

:formula_18

It is thus the square of the Vandermonde polynomial times formula_19.

This expression for the discriminant is often taken as a definition. It makes clear that if the polynomial has a multiple root, then its discriminant is zero, and that, in the case of real coefficients, if all the roots are real and simple, then the discriminant is positive. Unlike the previous definition, this expression is not obviously a polynomial in the coefficients, but this follows either from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, or from the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials and Vieta&#x27;s formulas by noting that this expression is a symmetric polynomial in the roots of .

==Low degrees==
The discriminant of a linear polynomial (degree 1) is rarely considered. If needed, it is commonly defined to be equal to 1 (using the usual conventions for the empty product and considering that one of the two blocks of the Sylvester matrix is empty). There is no common convention for the discriminant of a constant polynomial (i.e., polynomial of degree 0).

For small degrees, the discriminant is rather simple (see below), but for higher degrees, it may become unwieldy. For example, the discriminant of a general quartic has 16 terms, that of a quintic has 59 terms, and that of a sextic has 246 terms.
This is OEIS sequence .
===Degree 2===
The quadratic polynomial formula_20 has discriminant
:formula_21

The square root of the discriminant appears in the quadratic formula for the roots of the quadratic polynomial:
:formula_22

where the discriminant is zero if and only if the two roots are equal. If are real numbers, the polynomial has two distinct real roots if the discriminant is positive, and two complex conjugate roots if it is negative.

The discriminant is the product of and the square of the difference of the roots.

If are rational numbers, then the discriminant is the square of a rational number if and only if the two roots are rational numbers.

===Degree 3===
The cubic polynomial formula_23 has discriminant
:formula_24

In the special case of a depressed cubic polynomial formula_25, the discriminant simplifies to
:formula_26

The discriminant is zero if and only if at least two roots are equal. If the coefficients are real numbers, and the discriminant is not zero, the discriminant is positive if the roots are three distinct real numbers, and negative if there is one real root and two complex conjugate roots.

The square root of a quantity strongly related to the discriminant appears in the formulas for the roots of a cubic polynomial. Specifically, this quantity can be times the discriminant, or its product with the square of a rational number; for example, the square of in the case of Cardano formula.

If the polynomial is irreducible and its coefficients are rational numbers (or belong to a number field), then the discriminant is a square of a rational number (or a number from the number field) if and only if the Galois group of the cubic equation is the cyclic group of order three.

===Degree 4===

The quartic polynomial
formula_27
has discriminant
:formula_28

The depressed quartic polynomial
formula_29
has discriminant
:formula_30

The discriminant is zero if and only if at least two roots are equal. If the coefficients are real numbers and the discriminant is negative, then there are two real roots and two complex conjugate roots. Conversely, if the discriminant is positive, then the roots are either all real or all non-real.

==Properties==
===Zero discriminant===
The discriminant of a polynomial over a field is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root in some field extension.

The discriminant of a polynomial over an integral domain is zero if and only if the polynomial and its derivative have a non-constant common divisor.

In characteristic 0, this is equivalent to saying that the polynomial is not square-free (i.e., it is divisible by the square of a non-constant polynomial).

In nonzero characteristic , the discriminant is zero if and only if the polynomial is not square-free or it has an irreducible factor which is not separable (i.e., the irreducible factor is a polynomial in formula_31).

===Invariance under change of the variable===
The discriminant of a polynomial is, up to a scaling, invariant under any projective transformation of the variable. As a projective transformation may be decomposed into a product of translations, homotheties and inversions, this results in the following formulas for simpler transformations, where denotes a polynomial of degree , with formula_9 as leading coefficient.

* &quot;Invariance by translation&quot;:
::formula_33
:This results from the expression of the discriminant in terms of the roots
* &quot;Invariance by homothety&quot;:
::formula_34
:This results from the expression in terms of the roots, or of the quasi-homogeneity of the discriminant.
* &quot;Invariance by inversion&quot;:
::formula_35
:when formula_36 Here, formula_37 denotes the reciprocal polynomial of ; that is, if formula_38 and formula_39 then
::formula_40

===Invariance under ring homomorphisms===
Let formula_41 be a homomorphism of commutative rings. Given a polynomial 
:formula_42
in , the homomorphism formula_43 acts on for producing the polynomial
:formula_44
in .

The discriminant is invariant under formula_43 in the following sense. If formula_46 then 
:formula_47
As the discriminant is defined in terms of a determinant, this property results immediately from the similar property of determinants.

If formula_48 then formula_49 may be zero or not. One has, when formula_48
:formula_51

When one is only interested in knowing whether a discriminant is zero (as is generally the case in algebraic geometry), these properties may be summarised as:
:formula_52 if and only if either formula_53 or formula_54

This is often interpreted as saying that formula_52 if and only if formula_56 has a multiple root (possibly at infinity).

===Product of polynomials===
If is a product of polynomials in , then
:formula_57
where formula_58 denotes the resultant with respect to the variable , and and are the respective degrees of and .

This property follows immediately by substituting the expression for the resultant, and the discriminant, in terms of the roots of the respective polynomials.

===Homogeneity===
The discriminant is a homogeneous polynomial in the coefficients; it is also a homogeneous polynomial in the roots and thus quasi-homogeneous in the coefficients.

The discriminant of a polynomial of degree is homogeneous of degree in the coefficients. This can be seen in two ways. In terms of the roots-and-leading-term formula, multiplying all the coefficients by does not change the roots, but multiplies the leading term by . In terms of its expression as a determinant of a matrix (the Sylvester matrix) divided by , the determinant is homogeneous of degree in the entries, and dividing by makes the degree .

The discriminant of a polynomial of degree is homogeneous of degree in the roots. This follows from the expression of the discriminant in terms of the roots, which is the product of a constant and formula_59 squared differences of roots.

The discriminant of a polynomial of degree is quasi-homogeneous of degree in the coefficients, if, for every , the coefficient of formula_60 is given the weight . It is also quasi-homogeneous of the same degree, if, for every , the coefficient of formula_60 is given the weight . This is a consequence of the general fact that every polynomial which is homogeneous and symmetric in the roots may be expressed as a quasi-homogeneous polynomial in the elementary symmetric functions of the roots.

Consider the polynomial
:formula_62
It follows from what precedes that the exponents in every monomial formula_63 appearing in the discriminant satisfy the two equations
:formula_64
and
:formula_65
and also the equation
:formula_66
which is obtained by subtracting the second equation from the first one multiplied by .

This restricts the possible terms in the discriminant. For the general quadratic polynomial, the discriminant formula_67 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 which has only two there are only two terms, while the general homogeneous polynomial of degree two in three variables has 6 terms. The discriminant of the general cubic polynomial is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 in four variables; it has five terms, which is the maximum allowed by the above rules, while the general homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 in 4 variables has 35 terms.

For higher degrees, there may be monomials which satisfy above rules and do not appear in the discriminant. The first example is for the quartic polynomial formula_68, in which case the monomial formula_69 satisfies the rules without appearing in the discriminant.

==Real roots==
In this section, all polynomials have real coefficients.

It has been seen in that the sign of the discriminant provides useful information on the nature of the roots for polynomials of degree 2 and 3. For higher degrees, the information provided by the discriminant is less complete, but still useful. More precisely, for a polynomial of degree , one has:
* The polynomial has a multiple root if and only if its discriminant is zero.
* If the discriminant is positive, the number of non-real roots is a multiple of 4. That is, there is a nonnegative integer such that there are pairs of complex conjugate roots and real roots.
* If the discriminant is negative, the number of non-real roots is not a multiple of 4. That is, there is a nonnegative integer such that there are pairs of complex conjugate roots and real roots.

==Homogeneous bivariate polynomial==

Let
:formula_70
be a homogeneous polynomial of degree in two indeterminates.

Supposing, for the moment, that formula_71 and formula_9 are both nonzero, one has
:formula_73
Denoting this quantity by formula_74
one has
:formula_75
and
:formula_76

Because of these properties, the quantity formula_77 is called the &quot;discriminant&quot; or the &quot;homogeneous discriminant&quot; of .

If formula_71 and formula_9 are permitted to be zero, the polynomials and may have a degree smaller than . In this case, above formulas and definition remain valid, if the discriminants are computed as if all polynomials would have the degree . This means that the discriminants must be computed with formula_71 and formula_9 indeterminate, the substitution for them of their actual values being done &quot;after&quot; this computation. Equivalently, the formulas of must be used.

==Use in algebraic geometry==

The typical use of discriminants in algebraic geometry is for studying plane algebraic curves, and more generally algebraic hypersurfaces. Let be such a curve or hypersurface; is defined as the zero set of a multivariate polynomial. This polynomial may be considered as a univariate polynomial in one of the indeterminates, with polynomials in the other indeterminates as coefficients. The discriminant with respect to the selected indeterminate defines a hypersurface in the space of the other indeterminates. The points of are exactly the projection of the points of (including the points at infinity), which either are singular or have a tangent hyperplane that is parallel to the axis of the selected indeterminate.

For example, let be a bivariate polynomial in and with real coefficients, so that  is the implicit equation of a real plane algebraic curve. Viewing as a univariate polynomial in with coefficients depending on , then the discriminant is a polynomial in whose roots are the -coordinates of the singular points, of the points with a tangent parallel to the -axis and of some of the asymptotes parallel to the -axis. In other words, the computation of the roots of the -discriminant and the -discriminant allows one to compute all of the remarkable points of the curve, except the inflection points.

==Generalizations==
There are two classes of the concept of discriminant. The first class is the discriminant of an algebraic number field, which, in some cases including quadratic fields, is the discriminant of a polynomial defining the field.

Discriminants of the second class arise for problems depending on coefficients, when degenerate instances or singularities of the problem are characterized by the vanishing of a single polynomial in the coefficients. This is the case for the discriminant of a polynomial, which is zero when two roots collapse. Most of the cases, where such a generalized discriminant is defined, are instances of the following.

Let be a homogeneous polynomial in indeterminates over a field of characteristic 0, or of a prime characteristic that does not divide the degree of the polynomial. The polynomial defines a projective hypersurface, which has singular points if and only the partial derivatives of have a nontrivial common zero. This is the case if and only if the multivariate resultant of these partial derivatives is zero, and this resultant may be considered as the discriminant of . However, because of the integer coefficients resulting of the derivation, this multivariate resultant may be divisible by a power of , and it is better to take, as a discriminant, the primitive part of the resultant, computed with generic coefficients. The restriction on the characteristic is needed because otherwise a common zero of the partial derivative is not necessarily a zero of the polynomial (see Euler&#x27;s identity for homogeneous polynomials).

In the case of a homogeneous bivariate polynomial of degree , this general discriminant is formula_82 times the discriminant defined in . Several other classical types of discriminants, that are instances of the general definition are described in next sections.

===Quadratic forms===

A quadratic form is a function over a vector space, which is defined over some basis by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2:

:formula_83
or, in matrix form,
:formula_84

for the formula_85 symmetric matrix formula_86, the formula_87 row vector formula_88, and the formula_89 column vector formula_90. In characteristic different from 2, the discriminant or determinant of is the determinant of .

The Hessian determinant of is formula_91 times its discriminant. The multivariate resultant of the partial derivatives of is equal to its Hessian determinant. So, the discriminant of a quadratic form is a special case of the above general definition of a discriminant.

The discriminant of a quadratic form is invariant under linear changes of variables (that is a change of basis of the vector space on which the quadratic form is defined) in the following sense: a linear change of variables is defined by a nonsingular matrix , changes the matrix into formula_92 and thus multiplies the discriminant by the square of the determinant of . Thus the discriminant is well defined only up to the multiplication by a square. In other words, the discriminant of a quadratic form over a field is an element of , the quotient of the multiplicative monoid of by the subgroup of the nonzero squares (that is, two elements of are in the same equivalence class if one is the product of the other by a nonzero square). It follows that over the complex numbers, a discriminant is equivalent to 0 or 1. Over the real numbers, a discriminant is equivalent to −1, 0, or 1. Over the rational numbers, a discriminant is equivalent to a unique square-free integer.

By a theorem of Jacobi, a quadratic form over a field of characteristic different from 2 can be expressed, after a linear change of variables, in diagonal form as
:formula_93
More precisely, a quadratic forms on may be expressed as a sum
:formula_94
where the are independent linear forms and is the number of the variables (some of the may be zero). Equivalently, for any symmetric matrix , there is an elementary matrix such that formula_95 is a diagonal matrix.
Then the discriminant is the product of the , which is well-defined as a class in .

Geometrically, the discriminant of a quadratic form in three variables is the equation of a quadratic projective curve. The discriminant is zero if and only if the curve is decomposed in lines (possibly over an algebraically closed extension of the field).

A quadratic form in four variables is the equation of a projective surface. The surface has a singular point if and only its discriminant is zero. In this case, either the surface may be decomposed in planes, or it has a unique singular point, and is a cone or a cylinder. Over the reals, if the discriminant is positive, then the surface either has no real point or has everywhere a negative Gaussian curvature. If the discriminant is negative, the surface has real points, and has a negative Gaussian curvature.

===Conic sections===
A conic section is a plane curve defined by an implicit equation of the form

where are real numbers.

Two quadratic forms, and thus two discriminants may be associated to a conic section.

The first quadratic form is
:formula_97
Its discriminant is the determinant
:formula_98
It is zero if the conic section degenerates into two lines, a double line or a single point.

The second discriminant, which is the only one that is considered in many elementary textbooks, is the discriminant of the homogeneous part of degree two of the equation. It is equal to

:formula_99

and determines the shape of the conic section. If this discriminant is negative, the curve either has no real points, or is an ellipse or a circle, or, if degenerated, is reduced to a single point. If the discriminant is zero, the curve is a parabola, or, if degenerated, a double line or two parallel lines. If the discriminant is positive, the curve is a hyperbola, or, if degenerated, a pair of intersecting lines.

===Real quadric surfaces===
A real quadric surface in the Euclidean space of dimension three is a surface that may be defined as the zeros of a polynomial of degree two in three variables. As for the conic sections there are two discriminants that may be naturally defined. Both are useful for getting information on the nature of a quadric surface.

Let formula_100 be a polynomial of degree two in three variables that defines a real quadric surface. The first associated quadratic form, formula_101 depends on four variables, and is obtained by homogenizing ; that is
:formula_102
Let us denote its discriminant by formula_103

The second quadratic form, formula_104 depends on three variables, and consists of the terms of degree two of ; that is 
:formula_105
Let us denote its discriminant by formula_106

If formula_107 and the surface has real points, it is either a hyperbolic paraboloid or a one-sheet hyperboloid. In both cases, this is a ruled surface that has a negative Gaussian curvature at every point.

If formula_108 the surface is either an ellipsoid or a two-sheet hyperboloid or an elliptic paraboloid. In all cases, it has a positive Gaussian curvature at every point.

If formula_109 the surface has a singular point, possibly at infinity. If there is only one singular point, the surface is a cylinder or a cone. If there are several singular points the surface consists of two planes, a double plane or a single line.

When formula_110 the sign of formula_111 if not 0, does not provide any useful information, as changing into does not change the surface, but changes the sign of formula_106 However, if formula_113 and formula_114 the surface is a paraboloid, which is elliptic or hyperbolic, depending on the sign of formula_103

===Discriminant of an algebraic number field===
The discriminant of an algebraic number field measures the size of the (ring of integers of the) algebraic number field. 

More specifically, it is proportional to the squared volume of the fundamental domain of the ring of integers, and it regulates which primes are ramified.

The discriminant is one of the most basic invariants of a number field, and occurs in several important analytic formulas such as the functional equation of the Dedekind zeta function of &quot;K&quot;, and the analytic class number formula for &quot;K&quot;. A theorem of Hermite states that there are only finitely many number fields of bounded discriminant, however determining this quantity is still an open problem, and the subject of current research.

Let &quot;K&quot; be an algebraic number field, and let &quot;OK&quot; be its ring of integers. Let &quot;b&quot;1, ..., &quot;bn&quot; be an integral basis of &quot;OK&quot; (i.e. a basis as a Z-module), and let {σ1, ..., σ&quot;n&quot;} be the set of embeddings of &quot;K&quot; into the complex numbers (i.e. injective ring homomorphisms &quot;K&quot; → C). The discriminant of &quot;K&quot; is the square of the determinant of the &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;B&quot; whose (&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;)-entry is σ&quot;i&quot;(&quot;bj&quot;). Symbolically,

: formula_116
The discriminant of &quot;K&quot; can be referred to as the absolute discriminant of &quot;K&quot; to distinguish it from the of an extension &quot;K&quot;/&quot;L&quot; of number fields. The latter is an ideal in the ring of integers of &quot;L&quot;, and like the absolute discriminant it indicates which primes are ramified in &quot;K&quot;/&quot;L&quot;. It is a generalization of the absolute discriminant allowing for &quot;L&quot; to be bigger than Q; in fact, when &quot;L&quot; = Q, the relative discriminant of &quot;K&quot;/Q is the principal ideal of Z generated by the absolute discriminant of &quot;K&quot;.
===Fundamental discriminants===

A specific type of discriminant useful in the study of quadratic fields is the fundamental discriminant. It arises in the theory of integral binary quadratic forms, which are expressions of the form:formula_117
where formula_118, formula_119, and formula_120 are integers. The discriminant of formula_121 is given by:formula_122Not every integer can arise as a discriminant of an integral binary quadratic form. An integer formula_123 is a fundamental discriminant if and only if it meets one of the following criteria:

* Case 1: formula_123 is congruent to 1 modulo 4 (formula_125) and is square-free, meaning it is not divisible by the square of any prime number.
* Case 2: formula_123 is equal to four times an integer formula_127 (formula_128) where formula_127 is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4 (formula_130) and is square-free.

These conditions ensure that every fundamental discriminant corresponds uniquely to a specific type of quadratic form.

The first eleven positive fundamental discriminants are:

: 1, 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33 (sequence A003658 in the OEIS).

The first eleven negative fundamental discriminants are:

: −3, −4, −7, −8, −11, −15, −19, −20, −23, −24, −31 (sequence A003657 in the OEIS).

==== Quadratic number fields ====
A quadratic field is a field extension of the rational numbers formula_131 that has degree 2. The discriminant of a quadratic field plays a role analogous to the discriminant of a quadratic form.

There exists a fundamental connection: an integer formula_132 is a fundamental discriminant if and only if:

* formula_133, or
* formula_132 is the discriminant of a quadratic field.

For each fundamental discriminant formula_135, there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) quadratic field with formula_132 as its discriminant. This connects the theory of quadratic forms and the study of quadratic fields.

==== Prime factorization ====
Fundamental discriminants can also be characterized by their prime factorization. Consider the set formula_137 consisting of formula_138 the prime numbers congruent to 1 modulo 4, and the additive inverses of the prime numbers congruent to 3 modulo 4:formula_139An integer formula_140 is a fundamental discriminant if and only if it is a product of elements of formula_141 that are pairwise coprime.

<text>Gwyneth Evelyn &quot;Gwen&quot; Verdon (January 13, 1925October 18, 2000) was an American actress and dancer. She won four Tony Awards for her musical comedy performances, and she served as an uncredited choreographer&#x27;s assistant and specialty dance coach for theater and film. Verdon was a critically acclaimed performer on Broadway in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, having originated many roles in musicals, including Lola in &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, the title character in &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, and Roxie Hart in &quot;Chicago&quot;. 

Her second husband was director-choreographer Bob Fosse. The couple collaborated on a number of theater and film projects. After Fosse&#x27;s death, she worked to preserve his legacy.

==Early life==
Verdon was born in Culver City, California, the second child of Gertrude Lilian ( Standring) and Joseph William Verdon, who were both British immigrants to the United States by way of Canada. Her brother was William Farrell Verdon, her father was an electrician at MGM Studios, and her mother was a former vaudevillian of the Denishawn dance troupe, as well as a dance teacher.

As a toddler, she suffered from rickets, which led to her being called &quot;Gimpy&quot; by other children and spent her early years in orthopedic boots and rigid leg braces. At age three, her mother enrolled her in dance classes. Further ballet training strengthened her legs and improved her carriage. 

By age six, she was dancing on stage. She went on to study multiple dance forms, ranging from tap, jazz, ballroom and flamenco to Balinese. She also studied juggling. At age 11, she appeared as a solo ballerina in the musical romance film &quot;The King Steps Out&quot; (1936), directed by Josef von Sternberg and starring Grace Moore and Franchot Tone. She attended Hamilton High School in Los Angeles and studied under ballet enthusiast Ernest Belcher. While in high school, she was cast in a revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

In 1942, Verdon&#x27;s parents asked her to marry family friend and tabloid reporter James Henaghan after he got her pregnant at 17 years old, and she quit her dancing career to raise their child. In 1945, she appeared as a dancer in the movie musical &quot;Blonde From Brooklyn&quot;. After her divorce, she entrusted her son Jimmy to the care of her parents.

==Career==
Early on, Verdon found a job as assistant to choreographer Jack Cole, whose work was respected by both Broadway and Hollywood movie studios. During her five-year employment with Cole, she took small roles in movie musicals as a &quot;specialty dancer&quot;. She also taught dance to stars such as Jane Russell, Fernando Lamas, Lana Turner, Rita Hayworth, Betty Grable, and Marilyn Monroe. 

Verdon started out on Broadway going from one chorus line to another. Her breakthrough role finally came when choreographer Michael Kidd cast her as the second female lead in Cole Porter&#x27;s musical &quot;Can-Can&quot; (1953), starring French prima donna Lilo. Out-of-town reviewers hailed Verdon&#x27;s interpretation of Eve in the &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; ballet as a performance that upstaged the show&#x27;s star, who reputedly demanded Verdon&#x27;s role be cut to only two featured dance numbers. With her role reduced to little more than an ensemble part, Verdon formally announced her intention to quit by the time the show premiered on Broadway. But her opening-night &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; performance was so well-received that the audience screamed her name until the startled actress was brought from her dressing room in a towel to take a curtain call. Verdon received a pay increase and her first Tony Award for her performance.

Verdon&#x27;s biggest critical and commercial success was her following show, George Abbott&#x27;s &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1955), based on the novel &quot;The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant.&quot; The musical ran for 1,019 performances. Verdon won another Tony and went to Hollywood to repeat her role in the 1958 movie version &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, famously singing &quot;Whatever Lola Wants&quot;. (Fosse can be seen partnered with her in the original mambo duet &quot;Who&#x27;s Got the Pain&quot;.} 

Verdon won another Tony for her performance in the musical &quot;New Girl in Town&quot; as a hard-luck girl fleeing from her past as a prostitute. She won her fourth Tony for the murder-mystery musical &quot;Redhead,&quot; Fosse&#x27;s Broadway debut as a director/choreographer. In 1960, Fosse and Verdon wed. 

In 1966, Verdon returned to the stage in the role of Charity in &quot;Sweet Charity,&quot; which, like many of her earlier Broadway triumphs, was choreographed and directed by husband Fosse. The show is loosely based on Federico Fellini&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Nights of Cabiria.&quot; It was followed by a movie version starring Shirley MacLaine as Charity, featuring Ricardo Montalbán, Sammy Davis Jr. and Chita Rivera, with Fosse at the helm of his first film as director and choreographer. Verdon helped with the choreography. The numbers include the famed &quot;Big Spender&quot;, &quot;Rhythm of Life&quot;, &quot;If My Friends Could See Me Now&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m a Brass Band&quot;. Verdon also traveled to Berlin to help Fosse with &quot;Cabaret&quot;, the musical film for which he won an Oscar for Best Director.

Although estranged as a couple, Verdon continued to collaborate with Fosse as a performer and a choreagrapher. In the 1975 Broadway production of the Fosse-directed musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, Verdon originated the role of murderess Roxie Hart) opposite Chita Rivera&#x27;s Velma Kelly. Although the musical was almost universally panned by critics, who compared it unfavorably to Cabaret, Gwen Verdon was singled out for praise: her performance was &quot;delectable&quot; wrote the NY Times theater critic. Verdon also helped out with Fosse&#x27;s paean to Broadway dancing in the musical &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot; (1978), as well as Fosse&#x27;s autobiographical film &quot;All That Jazz&quot; (1979). The helpmate/peer played by Leland Palmer in that film is based on the role Verdon played in Fosse&#x27;s real life. She also developed a close working relationship with Fosse&#x27;s romantic partner of six years, Broadway dancer Ann Reinking, working as an instructor for Reinking&#x27;s musical theatre classes.

After the 1975 stage version of &quot;Chicago&quot; Verdon focused on film acting, playing character roles in movies such as &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985) and &quot;&quot; (1988). She collected several Emmy nominations in her guest performances on television shows, including nominations for appearances on &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; (1988), &quot;Dream On&quot; (1993) and &quot;&quot; (1993). Her film roles continued in prestigious films, such as the mother of Mia Farrow&#x27;s title character in the Woody Allen movie &quot;Alice&quot; (1990) and the ecentric Aunt Ruth in &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot; (1996), co-starring Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Other film roles include Alora in &quot;Walking Across Egypt&quot; (1999) and &quot;Bruno&quot;, released in 2000. 

In 1999, Verdon served as artistic consultant on the Broadway musical reprising classic Fosse choreography. Called simply &quot;Fosse,&quot; lacking any formal narrative, the revue was conceived and co-directed by Richard Maltby Jr. and Ann Reinking. (Verdon&#x27;s daughter with Fosse, performer Nicole Fosse received a &quot;special thanks&quot; credit). With glowing reviews, &quot;Fosse&quot; ran for 1000 performances on Broadway and collected 4 Tonys, including the Tony Award for Best Musical.

==Personal life==
Verdon was married twice and had two children. She married tabloid reporter James Archibald Henaghan in 1942. They had a son, Jim, the following year and divorced in 1947. In 1960, Verdon married choreographer Bob Fosse. They had a daughter, Nicole, in 1963. Fosse&#x27;s extramarital affairs put a strain on their marriage, and by 1971, Verdon and Fosse were separated, but never divorced. She was involved in relationships with actor Scott Brady and actor Jerry Lanning, son of Roberta Sherwood. Verdon was with Fosse when he suffered a fatal heart attack at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., in September 1987.

Verdon was a cat fancier, having up to six cats at one time, with the pets carrying names such as &quot;Feets Fosse&quot;, &quot;Junie Moon&quot;, and &quot;Tidbits Tumbler Fosse&quot;.

Verdon was a mental health-care advocate; later in life, she openly spoke about the positive effects of mental-health counseling. Along with teaching dance as a form of therapy, she sat on the board of directors for the New York Postgraduate Center for Mental Health, and actively raised funds to support mental health-care research.

She was also stated to be a big fan of baseball, and went to day games with her scout son.

==Death and legacy==
Verdon died from a heart attack on October 18, 2000, aged 75, at her daughter&#x27;s home in Woodstock, Vermont. Later that night, at 8 pm, all marquee lights on Broadway were dimmed in a tribute to Verdon.

==Popular culture==

<text>In mathematics, specifically in topology,
the interior of a subset of a topological space is the union of all subsets of that are open in .
A point that is in the interior of is an interior point of .

The interior of is the complement of the closure of the complement of .
In this sense interior and closure are dual notions.

The exterior of a set is the complement of the closure of ; it consists of the points that are in neither the set nor its boundary.
The interior, boundary, and exterior of a subset together partition the whole space into three blocks (or fewer when one or more of these is empty).

The interior and exterior of a closed curve are a slightly different concept; see the Jordan curve theorem.

==Definitions==

===Interior point===

If formula_1 is a subset of a Euclidean space, then formula_2 is an interior point of formula_1 if there exists an open ball centered at formula_2 which is completely contained in formula_5
(This is illustrated in the introductory section to this article.)

This definition generalizes to any subset formula_1 of a metric space formula_7 with metric formula_8: formula_2 is an interior point of formula_1 if there exists a real number formula_11 such that formula_12 is in formula_1 whenever the distance formula_14

This definition generalizes to topological spaces by replacing &quot;open ball&quot; with &quot;open set&quot;.
If formula_1 is a subset of a topological space formula_7 then formula_2 is an of formula_1 in formula_7 if formula_2 is contained in an open subset of formula_7 that is completely contained in formula_5
(Equivalently, formula_2 is an interior point of formula_1 if formula_1 is a neighbourhood of formula_26)

===Interior of a set===

The interior of a subset formula_1 of a topological space formula_28 denoted by formula_29 or formula_30 or formula_31 can be defined in any of the following equivalent ways:
# formula_30 is the largest open subset of formula_7 contained in formula_5
# formula_30 is the union of all open sets of formula_7 contained in formula_5
# formula_30 is the set of all interior points of formula_5
If the space formula_7 is understood from context then the shorter notation formula_30 is usually preferred to formula_42

==Examples==
*In any space, the interior of the empty set is the empty set.
*In any space formula_28 if formula_44 then formula_45
*If formula_7 is the real line formula_47 (with the standard topology), then formula_48 whereas the interior of the set formula_49 of rational numbers is empty: formula_50
*If formula_7 is the complex plane formula_52 then formula_53
*In any Euclidean space, the interior of any finite set is the empty set.

On the set of real numbers, one can put other topologies rather than the standard one:

*If formula_7 is the real numbers formula_47 with the lower limit topology, then formula_56
*If one considers on formula_47 the topology in which every set is open, then formula_58
*If one considers on formula_47 the topology in which the only open sets are the empty set and formula_47 itself, then formula_61 is the empty set.

These examples show that the interior of a set depends upon the topology of the underlying space.
The last two examples are special cases of the following.

*In any discrete space, since every set is open, every set is equal to its interior.
*In any indiscrete space formula_28 since the only open sets are the empty set and formula_7 itself, formula_64 and for every proper subset formula_1 of formula_28 formula_30 is the empty set.

==Properties==

Let formula_7 be a topological space and let formula_1 and formula_70 be subsets of formula_71

* formula_30 is open in formula_71
* If formula_70 is open in formula_7 then formula_76 if and only if formula_77
* formula_30 is an open subset of formula_1 when formula_1 is given the subspace topology.
* formula_1 is an open subset of formula_7 if and only if formula_83
* : formula_45
* : formula_85
* /: formula_86
** However, the interior operator does not distribute over unions since only formula_87 is guaranteed in general and equality might not hold. For example, if formula_88 and formula_89 then formula_90 is a proper subset of formula_91
* /: If formula_92 then formula_93

Other properties include:

* If formula_1 is closed in formula_7 and formula_96 then formula_97

Relationship with closure

The above statements will remain true if all instances of the symbols/words
:&quot;interior&quot;, &quot;int&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, &quot;subset&quot;, and &quot;largest&quot;
are respectively replaced by
:&quot;closure&quot;, &quot;cl&quot;, &quot;closed&quot;, &quot;superset&quot;, and &quot;smallest&quot;
and the following symbols are swapped:
# &quot;formula_98&quot; swapped with &quot;formula_99&quot;
# &quot;formula_100&quot; swapped with &quot;formula_101&quot;
For more details on this matter, see interior operator below or the article Kuratowski closure axioms.

==Interior operator==
The interior operator formula_102 is dual to the closure operator, which is denoted by formula_103 or by an overline —, in the sense that
formula_104
and also
formula_105
where formula_7 is the topological space containing formula_107 and the backslash formula_108 denotes set-theoretic difference.
Therefore, the abstract theory of closure operators and the Kuratowski closure axioms can be readily translated into the language of interior operators, by replacing sets with their complements in formula_71

In general, the interior operator does not commute with unions. However, in a complete metric space the following result does hold:

The result above implies that every complete metric space is a Baire space.

==Exterior of a set==

The exterior of a subset formula_1 of a topological space formula_28 denoted by formula_112 or simply formula_113 is the largest open set disjoint from formula_107 namely, it is the union of all open sets in formula_7 that are disjoint from formula_5 The exterior is the interior of the complement, which is the same as the complement of the closure; in formulas,
formula_117

Similarly, the interior is the exterior of the complement:
formula_118

The interior, boundary, and exterior of a set formula_1 together partition the whole space into three blocks (or fewer when one or more of these is empty):
formula_120
where formula_121 denotes the boundary of formula_5 The interior and exterior are always open, while the boundary is closed.

Some of the properties of the exterior operator are unlike those of the interior operator:
* The exterior operator reverses inclusions; if formula_123 then formula_124
* The exterior operator is not idempotent. It does have the property that formula_125

==Interior-disjoint shapes==

Two shapes formula_126 and formula_127 are called &quot;interior-disjoint&quot; if the intersection of their interiors is empty.
Interior-disjoint shapes may or may not intersect in their boundary.

<doc id="55611" wikidata="Q864919" url="?curid=55611" title="Alexandroff extension">
<text>In the mathematical field of topology, the Alexandroff extension is a way to extend a noncompact topological space by adjoining a single point in such a way that the resulting space is compact. It is named after the Russian mathematician Pavel Alexandroff.
More precisely, let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space. Then the Alexandroff extension of &quot;X&quot; is a certain compact space &quot;X&quot;* together with an open embedding &quot;c&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot;* such that the complement of &quot;X&quot; in &quot;X&quot;* consists of a single point, typically denoted ∞. The map &quot;c&quot; is a Hausdorff compactification if and only if &quot;X&quot; is a locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff space. For such spaces the Alexandroff extension is called the one-point compactification or Alexandroff compactification. The advantages of the Alexandroff compactification lie in its simple, often geometrically meaningful structure and the fact that it is in a precise sense minimal among all compactifications; the disadvantage lies in the fact that it only gives a Hausdorff compactification on the class of locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff spaces, unlike the Stone–Čech compactification which exists for any topological space (but provides an embedding exactly for Tychonoff spaces).

== Example: inverse stereographic projection ==
A geometrically appealing example of one-point compactification is given by the inverse stereographic projection. Recall that the stereographic projection &quot;S&quot; gives an explicit homeomorphism from the unit sphere minus the north pole (0,0,1) to the Euclidean plane. The inverse stereographic projection formula_1 is an open, dense embedding into a compact Hausdorff space obtained by adjoining the additional point formula_2. Under the stereographic projection latitudinal circles formula_3 get mapped to planar circles formula_4. It follows that the deleted neighborhood basis of formula_5 given by the punctured spherical caps formula_6 corresponds to the complements of closed planar disks formula_7. More qualitatively, a neighborhood basis at formula_8 is furnished by the sets formula_9 as &quot;K&quot; ranges through the compact subsets of formula_10. This example already contains the key concepts of the general case.

== Motivation ==
Let formula_11 be an embedding from a topological space &quot;X&quot; to a compact Hausdorff topological space &quot;Y&quot;, with dense image and one-point remainder formula_12. Then &quot;c&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is open in a compact Hausdorff space so is locally compact Hausdorff, hence its homeomorphic preimage &quot;X&quot; is also locally compact Hausdorff. Moreover, if &quot;X&quot; were compact then &quot;c&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) would be closed in &quot;Y&quot; and hence not dense. Thus a space can only admit a Hausdorff one-point compactification if it is locally compact, noncompact and Hausdorff. Moreover, in such a one-point compactification the image of a neighborhood basis for &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; gives a neighborhood basis for &quot;c&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in &quot;c&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), and—because a subset of a compact Hausdorff space is compact if and only if it is closed—the open neighborhoods of formula_8 must be all sets obtained by adjoining formula_8 to the image under &quot;c&quot; of a subset of &quot;X&quot; with compact complement.

== The Alexandroff extension ==
Let formula_15 be a topological space. Put formula_16 and topologize formula_17 by taking as open sets all the open sets in &quot;X&quot; together with all sets of the form formula_18 where &quot;C&quot; is closed and compact in &quot;X&quot;. Here, formula_19 denotes the complement of formula_20 in formula_21 Note that formula_22 is an open neighborhood of formula_23 and thus any open cover of formula_24 will contain all except a compact subset formula_25 of formula_26 implying that formula_17 is compact .

The space formula_17 is called the Alexandroff extension of &quot;X&quot; (Willard, 19A). Sometimes the same name is used for the inclusion map formula_29

The properties below follow from the above discussion:

* The map &quot;c&quot; is continuous and open: it embeds &quot;X&quot; as an open subset of formula_17.
* The space formula_17 is compact.
* The image &quot;c&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is dense in formula_17, if &quot;X&quot; is noncompact.
* The space formula_17 is Hausdorff if and only if &quot;X&quot; is Hausdorff and locally compact.
* The space formula_17 is T1 if and only if &quot;X&quot; is T1.

== The one-point compactification ==
In particular, the Alexandroff extension formula_35 is a Hausdorff compactification of &quot;X&quot; if and only if &quot;X&quot; is Hausdorff, noncompact and locally compact. In this case it is called the one-point compactification or Alexandroff compactification of &quot;X&quot;.

Recall from the above discussion that any Hausdorff compactification with one point remainder is necessarily (isomorphic to) the Alexandroff compactification. In particular, if formula_15 is a compact Hausdorff space and formula_37 is a limit point of formula_15 (i.e. not an isolated point of formula_15), formula_15 is the Alexandroff compactification of formula_41.

Let &quot;X&quot; be any noncompact Tychonoff space. Under the natural partial ordering on the set formula_42 of equivalence classes of compactifications, any minimal element is equivalent to the Alexandroff extension (Engelking, Theorem 3.5.12). It follows that a noncompact Tychonoff space admits a minimal compactification if and only if it is locally compact.

== Non-Hausdorff one-point compactifications ==
Let formula_43 be an arbitrary noncompact topological space. One may want to determine all the compactifications (not necessarily Hausdorff) of formula_15 obtained by adding a single point, which could also be called &quot;one-point compactifications&quot; in this context. 
So one wants to determine all possible ways to give formula_45 a compact topology such that formula_15 is dense in it and the subspace topology on formula_15 induced from formula_17 is the same as the original topology. The last compatibility condition on the topology automatically implies that formula_15 is dense in formula_17, because formula_15 is not compact, so it cannot be closed in a compact space.
Also, it is a fact that the inclusion map formula_52 is necessarily an open embedding, that is, formula_15 must be open in formula_17 and the topology on formula_17 must contain every member
of formula_56.
So the topology on formula_17 is determined by the neighbourhoods of formula_8. Any neighborhood of formula_8 is necessarily the complement in formula_17 of a closed compact subset of formula_15, as previously discussed.

The topologies on formula_17 that make it a compactification of formula_15 are as follows:
* The Alexandroff extension of formula_15 defined above. Here we take the complements of all closed compact subsets of formula_15 as neighborhoods of formula_8. This is the largest topology that makes formula_17 a one-point compactification of formula_15.
* The open extension topology. Here we add a single neighborhood of formula_8, namely the whole space formula_17. This is the smallest topology that makes formula_17 a one-point compactification of formula_15.
* Any topology intermediate between the two topologies above. For neighborhoods of formula_8 one has to pick a suitable subfamily of the complements of all closed compact subsets of formula_15; for example, the complements of all finite closed compact subsets, or the complements of all countable closed compact subsets.

== Further examples ==
=== Compactifications of discrete spaces===
* The one-point compactification of the set of positive integers is homeomorphic to the space consisting of &quot;K&quot; = {0} U {1/&quot;n&quot; | &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer} with the order topology.
* A sequence formula_75 in a topological space formula_15 converges to a point formula_77 in formula_15, if and only if the map formula_79 given by formula_80 for formula_81 in formula_82 and formula_83 is continuous. Here formula_82 has the discrete topology.
* Polyadic spaces are defined as topological spaces that are the continuous image of the power of a one-point compactification of a discrete, locally compact Hausdorff space.

=== Compactifications of continuous spaces===
* The one-point compactification of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot; is homeomorphic to the &quot;n&quot;-sphere &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;. As above, the map can be given explicitly as an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional inverse stereographic projection.
* The one-point compactification of the product of formula_85 copies of the half-closed interval [0,1), that is, of formula_86, is (homeomorphic to) formula_87. 
* Since the closure of a connected subset is connected, the Alexandroff extension of a noncompact connected space is connected. However a one-point compactification may &quot;connect&quot; a disconnected space: for instance the one-point compactification of the disjoint union of a finite number formula_81 of copies of the interval (0,1) is a wedge of formula_81 circles.
* The one-point compactification of the disjoint union of a countable number of copies of the interval (0,1) is the Hawaiian earring. This is different from the wedge of countably many circles, which is not compact.
* Given formula_15 compact Hausdorff and formula_25 any closed subset of formula_15, the one-point compactification of formula_93 is formula_94, where the forward slash denotes the quotient space.
* If formula_15 and formula_96 are locally compact Hausdorff, then formula_97 where formula_98 is the smash product. Recall that the definition of the smash product:formula_99 where formula_100 is the wedge sum, and again, / denotes the quotient space.

=== As a functor ===
The Alexandroff extension can be viewed as a functor from the category of topological spaces with proper continuous maps as morphisms to the category whose objects are continuous maps formula_101 and for which the morphisms from formula_102 to formula_103 are pairs of continuous maps formula_104 such that formula_105. In particular, homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic Alexandroff extensions.

<text>A nurse uniform is attire worn by nurses for hygiene and identification. The traditional nurse uniform consists of a dress, apron and cap. It has existed in many variants, but the basic style has remained recognizable.

==History==
The first nurse uniforms were derived from the nun&#x27;s habit. Before the 19th century, nuns took care of sick and injured people so it was obvious that trained lay nurses might copy the nun&#x27;s habit as they have adopted ranks like &quot;Sister&quot;. One of Florence Nightingale&#x27;s first students (Miss van Rensselaer) designed the original uniform for the students at Miss Nightingale&#x27;s school of nursing. Before the 1940s minor changes occurred in the uniform. The clothing consisted of a mainly blue outfit. Hospitals were free to determine the style of the nurse uniform, including the nurse&#x27;s cap which exists in many variants.

In Britain, the national uniform (or simply &quot;national&quot;) was designed with the advent of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, and the Newcastle dress. From the 1960s open necks began to appear. In the 1970s, white disposable paper caps replaced cotton ones; in the 1980s, plastic aprons displaced the traditional ones and outerwear began to disappear. From the 1990s, scrubs became popular in Britain, having first appeared in the USA; however, some nurses in Britain continue to wear dresses, although some NHS trusts have removed them in favour of scrubs as in many other countries.

==Standard nurse&#x27;s uniform==
Historically, a typical nurse uniform consisted of a dress, pinafore apron and nurse&#x27;s cap. In some hospitals, however, student nurses also wore a nursing pin, or the pinafore apron may have been replaced by a cobbler style apron. This type of nurse&#x27;s dress continues to be worn in many countries.

Traditional uniforms remain common in many countries, but in Western Europe and North America, the so-called &quot;scrubs&quot; or tunics have become more popular. &quot;Scrub dress&quot; is a simpler type of uniform, and is almost always worn in operating rooms and emergency rooms.

Nurses have a variety of roles in the 21st century and therefore have a variety of &quot;uniforms&quot;. Nurse scientists may wear a lab coat, while nurse executives may wear a suit. The &quot;uniform&quot; will vary by country and role.

==Alternative nurse uniforms==

Since the late 1980s, there has been a move towards alternative designs of nursing uniforms in some countries. Newer style nurse&#x27;s uniform in the United Kingdom consists of either:

# A tunic-style top and dark blue trousers that are optimally designed to prevent cross-infection, the colour of which depends upon the grade (or, more recently, band) and gender of the nurse – the colour varies between NHS Trusts. The tunics often feature piping around the edges of the uniform.
# A dress in the same colour as the tunic-style top.

===Male nursing uniform===
In some countries the nurse&#x27;s uniform is now gender neutral. When this is not the case, male nurses wear a different uniform to their female counterparts. In the UK, male nurses often wear a white tunic with epaulettes in a color or quantity that represents their year of training or grade. However, in many trusts the white uniform is now obsolete and uniforms are non-gender specific.
No Uniform

In some settings, for example in psychiatric inpatient units in the UK, it is common for mental health and learning disorder nurses to not wear a formal uniform.

==Nurse uniforms versus scrubs==

Beginning in the 1990s, and until the present time, the traditional nurse uniforms have been replaced with the &quot;new&quot; scrub dress in some countries. Most hospitals in the US and Europe argue that the scrub uniform is easier to clean than the old nurse uniforms. The nurses who wear the uniforms are divided into two camps:

* Those who prefer the new scrubs; disliked the old white nurse dress uniforms.
* The nurses who liked the old white nurse dress uniforms; they argue that nurses who wear scrubs are seen by the patients as cleaners or surgeons and cannot be identified as nurses.

In many parts of the world, nurses continue to wear a uniform consisting of a dress, pinafore and cap. The traditional white uniform for male nursing staff is now going out of fashion, except for student nurses. A tunic of either the dental surgeon style or a V-neck with a collar is very often used. The colours vary with grade, area of work, and hospital; however, the male equivalent of a sister (that is, charge nurse) tend to be shades of blue or dark green: often, this is the only colour to be recognised by the public as signifying a person in authority.

===Nursing jewellery===

Nurses were actively discouraged from wearing jewellery which might distract from their purpose and get caught on patient skin during care activity. A fob watch or &quot;pendant&quot; watch is considered synonymous with nursing. The fob watch frees the nurses&#x27; hands for client care and prevents the wrist watch becoming a vector for disease. Watches are sometimes given as a token rite-of-passage gift from parents to young nurses, who are making the transition into nurses&#x27; quarters and live away from home for the first time.

<text>A school uniform is a uniform worn by students primarily for a school or otherwise an educational institution. They are common in primary and secondary schools in various countries and are generally widespread in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and much of the Americas, but are not common in the United States, Canada, and most countries in continental Europe.

An example of a uniform would be requiring button-down shirts, trousers for boys, and blouses and pleated skirts for girls, with both wearing blazers. A uniform can even be as simple as requiring collared shirts, or restricting colour choices and limiting items students are allowed to wear.

==Uniform==

Although often used interchangeably, there is an important difference between dress codes and school uniforms: according to scholars such as Nathan Joseph, clothing can only be considered a uniform when it &quot;(a) serves as a group emblem, (b) certifies an institution&#x27;s legitimacy by revealing individual&#x27;s relative positions and (c) suppresses individuality.&quot;
Conversely, a dress code is much less restrictive, and focuses &quot;on promoting modesty and discouraging anti-social fashion statements&quot;, according to Marian Wilde. Examples of a dress code would be not allowing ripped clothing, no logos or limiting the amount of skin that can be shown. 

School uniforms are clothes that are usually used for school, each level of school has a different uniform. Each educational unit has its own distinctive school uniform. School uniforms have benefits like fostering a sense of unity and reducing distractions in school. Some drawbacks are limiting self-expression and a financial burden on some households. It is important to look at the pros and cons of school uniforms.

==History==
It is difficult to trace the origins of the uniform as there is no comprehensive written history, but rather a variety of known influences. School uniforms are believed to be a practice which dates to the 16th century in the United Kingdom. It is believed that the Christ&#x27;s Hospital School in England in 1552 was the first school to use a school uniform. Students were given a uniform that most notably consisted of a long blue coat and yellow, knee-high socks. An almost identical uniform is still worn by students attending the school today. The earliest documented proof of institutionalized use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the then Archbishop of Canterbury ordered the wearing of the cappa clausa. This monastic and academic practice evolved into collegiate uniforms in England, particularly in charity schools where uniform dress was often provided for poor children. Universities, primary schools and secondary schools used uniforms as a marker of class and status. Although school uniforms can often be considered and old-fashioned, uniforms in recent years have changed as societal dress codes have changed.

==Contemporary==
In the United States, a movement toward using uniforms in state schools began when Bill Clinton addressed it in the 1996 State of the Union, saying: &quot;If it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear uniforms.&quot; As of 1998 approximately 25% of all U.S. public elementary, middle and junior high schools had adopted a uniform policy or were considering a policy, and two-thirds were implemented between 1995 and 1997. New York City&#x27;s then-new schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, made it clear that he would not follow Clinton&#x27;s idea.

There is an abundance of theories and empirical studies looking at school uniforms, making statements about their effectiveness. These theories and studies elaborate on the benefits and also the shortcomings of uniform policies. The issue of nature vs. nurture comes into play, as uniforms affect the perceptions of masculinity and femininity, over-simplify issues of gender classification, and attempt to suppress students&#x27; sexuality. Uniforms bring a variety of pros, cons, and major legal implications and controversies.

There are two main empirical findings that are most often cited in the political rhetoric surrounding the uniform debate. One of these, the case study of the Long Beach Unified School District, is most often cited in support of school uniforms and their effectiveness whereas &quot;Effects of Student Uniforms on Attendance, Behavior Problems, Substance Use, and Academic Achievement&quot; is the most frequently cited research in opposition to the implementation of school uniform policies.

===Effects of uniforms on students===
The case study of the Long Beach Unified School District was the study of the first large, urban school in the United States to implement a uniform policy. In 1994, mandatory school uniforms were implemented for the districts elementary and middle schools as a strategy to address the students&#x27; behavior issues. The district simultaneously implemented a longitudinal study to research the effects of the uniforms on student behavior. The study attributed favorable student behavioral changes and a significant drop in school discipline issues to the mandatory uniform policy. Wearing school uniforms was associated with fewer absences and truancies and fewer referrals to the office for behavior problems. Suspensions and expulsions were reduced by 28% (elementary) and 36% (middle school), crime and vandalism by 74% (elementary) and 18% (middle school). However the school district also added other security measures such as security guards, 
and metal detectors so the success cannot be solely attributed to the uniforms. The district later removed the uniforms. 

Other research found that uniforms were not an effective deterrent to decrease truancy, did not decrease behavior problems, decrease substance use, and in fact may be associated with poorer student achievement relative to students not required to wear school uniforms.

Brunsma stated that despite the inconclusiveness of the effects of uniforms, they became more common because &quot;this is an issue of children&#x27;s rights, of social control, and one related to increasing racial, class and gender inequalities in our schools.&quot;

== Laws and rulings ==
As uniforms have become more normalised, there have also been an increasing number of lawsuits brought against school districts. According to David Brunsma, one in four public elementary schools and one in eight public middle and high schools in the United States have policies dictating what a student wears to school. The school code within states&#x27; constitutions typically asserts that it allows the board of school directors to make reasonable rules and regulations as they see fit in managing the school&#x27;s affairs. As of 2008, there are currently 23 states that allow school districts to mandate school uniforms. The constitutional objections usually brought upon school districts tend to fall into one of the following two categories: (1) a violation of the students&#x27; First Amendment right to free expression (2) a violation of parents&#x27; right to raise their children without government interference. Although up until this point, The Supreme Court has not ruled on a case involving school uniforms directly, in the 1968 decision Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the Court ruled that upon entering school, students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech.

Internationally, there are differing views of school uniforms. In the Australian state of Queensland, Ombudsman Fred Albietz ruled in 1998 that state schools may not require uniforms. In the Philippines, the Department of Education abolished the requirement of school uniforms in public schools. In England and Wales, technically a state school may not permanently exclude students for &quot;breaching school uniform policy&quot;, under a policy promulgated by the Department for Children, Schools and Families but students not wearing the correct uniform are asked to go home and change. In Scotland, some local councils (that have responsibility for delivering state education) do not insist on students wearing a uniform as a precondition to attending and taking part in curricular activities. Turkey abolished mandatory uniforms in 2010.

===Examples of lawsuits in the United States===

====&quot;Canady v. Bossier Parish School Board&quot;====

In the &quot;Canady v. Bossier Parish School Board&quot; lawsuit in 2000, a Louisiana district court ruled in favour of the school board because it did not see how the free speech rights of the students were being violated due to the school board&#x27;s uniform policy. Even though the plaintiff appealed the decision, the Fifth Circuit Court also ruled in favour of the school board after implementing a four-step system that is still used today. Firstly, a school board has to have the right to set up a policy. Secondly, the policy must be determined to support a fundamental interest of the board as a whole. Thirdly, the guidelines cannot have been set for the purpose of censorship. Finally, the limits on student expression cannot be greater than the interest of the board. As long as these four policies are in place, then no constitutional violation can be claimed.

====&quot;Littlefield v. Forney Independent School District&quot;====

In the Forney Independent School District of Forney, Texas in 2001, the school board decided to implement a school uniform policy allowing the students to wear a polo shirt, oxford shirt or blouse in four possible colours, and blue or khaki trousers or shirts, a skirt or jumper. While there was some flexibility with shoes, certain types were prohibited along with any sort of baggy clothes. The parents of the Littlefield family requested that their son be exempt from the policy, but were denied. In response, the Littlefields filed a lawsuit against the school district, under the pretenses that this uniform mandate infringed on their rights as parents to control how they brought up their children and their education. They even went as far as to cite an infringement on religious freedom, claiming that opting out of the uniforms on the grounds of religion allowed the school to rank the validity of certain religions. Before trial, the District Court dismissed the case, so the family appealed. Ultimately, the Fifth Circuit Court ruled that the students&#x27; rights were not being violated even though the claims presented were valid. They ruled that school rules derived from the education would override the parents&#x27; right to control their children&#x27;s upbringing in this specific situation. As far as the religious freedom violation accusations, the court ruled that the policy did not have a religious goal, and thus did not infringe on religious freedom rights.

====&quot;Jacobs v. Clark County School District&quot;====
In 2003, Liberty High School, a school of the Clark County School District in Henderson, Nevada, implemented a uniform policy of khakis and red, white or blue polo shirts. A junior by the name of Kimberly Jacobs was suspended a total of five times because she wore a religious shirt to school and got cited for uniform violations. Her family sued the Clark County School District under the claims that her First Amendment rights were being infringed upon and that the uniform policy was causing students to be deprived of due process. The plaintiff&#x27;s requests were for injunctive relief, the expunging of suspensions from Jacob&#x27;s school record and awarding of damages. The injunction was granted to the family meaning that the school could no longer discipline her for breaking the uniform policy. At this ruling, the school district appealed. The next court ruled on the side of the school district as it determined that the uniform policy was in fact neutral and constitutional, and it dismissed the claims of the plaintiff.

====&quot;Frudden v. Washoe County School District&quot;====
In 2011, a Nevada public elementary school of the Washoe County School District decided to add the school&#x27;s motto, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Leaders&quot; embroidered in small letters on the shirt. In response, Mary and John Frudden, parents of a student sued the school district on the basis of it violating the First Amendment. The court ultimately dismissed the case filed by the Fruddens over the uniforms. However, the family appealed, and two years later, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard the case. The court ruled to reverse the previous decision of dismissing the case, and also questioned the apparent policy for students that were part of a nationally recognised group such as Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts who were able to wear the uniforms in place of the school ones on regular meeting days. The 9th circuit panel ruled that the school had not provided enough evidence for why it instituted this policy, and that the family was never given a chance to argue.

==Social implications of school uniforms on gender==
There are several positive and negative social implications of uniforms on both the students wearing them and society as a whole.

===Perceptions of masculinity and femininity===
One of the criticisms of uniforms is that it imposes standards of masculinity and femininity from a young age. Uniforms are considered a form of discipline that schools use to control student behavior and often promote conventional gendered dress.

Boys often are required to wear trousers, belts, and closed-toe shoes and have their shirts tucked in at all times. They are also often required to have their hair cut short. Some critics allege that this uniform is associated with the dress of a professional business man, which, they claim, gives boys at a young age the impression that masculinity is gained through business success.

For girls, many uniforms promote femininity by requiring girls to wear skirts. Skirts are seen by some critics as a symbol of femininity because they restrict movement and force certain ways of sitting and playing. Uniforms that include an apron for girls may suggest that the appropriate feminine societal role is a primarily domestic one. Some girls&#x27; school uniforms have been criticized as having an uncomfortable design, which prevents girls from freedom of movement and exposes girls to cold during winter.

School uniforms are embedded with gender symbolism. Schools that require students to wear a formal uniform almost universally provide trousers for boys and skirts or dresses for girls. Skirts differentiate the female from the male, thereby confirming traditional gender identities for students who must wear the correct attire corresponding to their sex. Skirts and dresses demand a particular type of feminine gender performance, whereas trousers demand a particular masculine gender performance. By forcing students to wear attire that corresponds with their sex inherently assigns the ways a student must perform their gender. This causes controversy when a student does not want to identify with a gender that does not align with their sex. There are rarely guidelines that allow for students to dress according to their performed gender, but almost always according to their sex assigned at birth.

===Sexualization of girls===
Around middle or junior school, students begin going through puberty. Uniforms can be seen as a way to restrict the sexualization of girls by taking the focus away from sexuality and focus it on academics in a school setting for girls.

Sometimes the desire to prevent overtly sexualized clothing through uniforms can fail. As an example, miniskirts have been very popular in Japan, where they are common parts of school uniforms and came to be worn within the Kogal culture.

&quot;The pleasure our culture derives from gazing at girls who look feminine conflicts with girls&#x27; freedom to run around unselfconsciously and to develop their gross motor talents as boys are encouraged to do&quot; (Collins et al. 1996, p. 170). Schoolgirl uniforms are used in costumes in the context of &quot;Sexy Schoolgirl&quot; and are sold on costume sites year round. The idea of the female school uniform has become sexual and in Britain a new survey from Plan International UK found that a third of girls have been sexually harassed while wearing their school uniform. School uniforms can encourage harassment as children, as some cultures can define the &quot;schoolgirl look&quot; as sexual. Children as young as 8 years old report being victims of, or witnesses to, harassment. Two-thirds of the children questioned in the survey said they have experienced &quot;unwanted sexual attention&quot; in public, and 35 per cent said they have been touched, groped or grabbed without their consent. These experiences teach girls that being harassed by men is just a part of growing up. The perception of schoolgirl uniforms allows for men to harass girls at a young age, causing girls to self-objectify their bodies from the beginning of their schooling experience.

== Controversies ==

=== General ===


In some cultures, the topic of school uniforms has sparked a multitude of controversies and debates over the years. Debates concerning the constitutionality and economic feasibility of uniforms also contribute to the controversy.

In the United States, the implementation of school uniforms began following ten years of research indicating the effectiveness of private schools. Some state-school reformers cited this research to support policies linked to private and Catholic school success. Some public-school administrators hence began implementing uniform policies to improve the overall school environment and academic achievement of the students. This is based on the assumption that uniforms are the direct cause of behavioral and academic outcome changes. However, within the Catholic school literature, school uniforms have never been acknowledged as a primary factor in producing a Catholic school effect.

Another area of controversy regarding school uniform and dress code policies revolve around the issue of gender. Nowadays, more teenagers are more frequently &quot;dressing to articulate, or confound gender identity and sexual orientation&quot;, which brings about &quot;responses from school officials that ranged from indifferences to applause to bans&quot;. 

=== Positives ===


Advocates of uniforms have proposed several reasons supporting their implementation and claiming their success in schools. Advocates believe that uniforms affect student safety by decreasing student victimization, gang activity, and fights. There has been no concrete evidence of this, and studies by Ohio State University and others showed that uniforms did not increase test scores, grades, or focus. However, attendance increased by less than half of a day. The students felt even less of a sense of belonging at a school with uniforms.

Kathleen Wade conducted an experiment to see if bullying and gang presence was higher in uniform or non-uniform schools. The research was done with multiple schools where she gave a questionnaire to both students and faculty to see if there was a significant difference. Her results showed that bullying and gang presence significantly decreases with students wearing school uniforms.
*Differentiating strangers from students in school buildings

For example, in the first year of the mandatory uniform policy in Long Beach, California, officials reported that fighting in schools decreased by more than 50%, assault and battery by 34%, sex offenses by 74%, and robbery by 66%. However the district also added other safety measures like security guards so the success cannot be attributed to the uniforms solely. 

Advocates also believe that uniforms increase student learning and positive attitudes toward school through:

*Enhanced learning environments
*Heightened school pride
*Increased student achievement
*High levels of preparedness
*Conformity to organizational goals

Currently, pros of school uniforms center around how uniforms affect school environments. Advocates say that uniforms may create a safe learning environment for students to help them focus on school work and can lead them to great academic accomplishments. Students who wear school uniforms may not feel anxious or nervous about peer pressure in buying new clothes to fit in or being teased by other classmates. Proponents have found a significant positive impact on school climate, safety, and students&#x27; self-perception from the implementation of uniforms.

However, though modern studies and tests prove uniforms did not increase test scores, behavior, bullying, focus and attendance barely increased.

=== Negatives ===
The opposing side of uniforms has claimed their ineffectiveness using a variety of justifications, a variety of which have research supporting them. Some of the cons to school uniforms include the following legal, financial, and questionable effectiveness concerns: The primary concern with school uniforms or strict dress codes is that it limits the ability of students to express themselves. While in countries where uniforms are the norm it simply isn&#x27;t the case. Clothing is viewed as a means of expression – making all students wear the same clothes or limit them to what they can wear can disrupt their sense of identity. One of the main controversies focuses on dress code policies versus freedom of speech. This establishes that students cannot wear the latest trends or clothes that the school finds that interrupt the learning environment. However, students can wear clothing that express their religion. &quot;Both the Constitution and most state laws protect students&#x27; rights to wear religious attire... such as the wearing of a turban, yarmulke, or headscarf.&quot;

Another negative aspect of school uniforms is that the policy can be sexist. Boys and girls are often not disciplined in the same ways when it comes to dress codes. Girls are more commonly disciplined for certain articles of clothing that are prohibited because they &quot;distract&quot; boys. &quot;Transgender students have been sent home for wearing clothing different from what&#x27;s expected of their legalness, while others have been excluded from yearbooks.&quot;
Uniforms also generally disadvantage students, especially girls, in freedom of movement and comfort. The research was conducted on an Australian independent private school and its uniform. Comfort-wise, for boys, the blazer was too hot/cold and uncomfortable. For girls, the light coloured cotton school dress was restrictive, see-through, hot, uncomfortable, and impractical. Furthermore, the stockings were often cold, grey woolen kilt was too heavy and restrictive of movement, and the wind could cause it to reveal more than the girls wanted. When playing and moving around, for boys, the school tie was a choking hazard, and the trousers had no stretch. For girls, the dress/skirt caused modesty issues (e.g. hard to swing on monkey bars/run around while keeping her privacy, hence stop being active), and the kilts were too big and heavy.

Research on how school uniforms and school dress codes influence the student can be inconclusive. &quot;In the U.S., over half of public schools have a dress code, which frequently outline gender-specific policies.&quot;

*Legal concerns
**Focus on the supposition that requiring a uniform violates children&#x27;s individual rights (Thomas, 1994; Virginia State Dep’t of Edu, 1992)
**Mandatory uniform policies are being considered largely for urban school districts, and, hence are being forced on a predominantly minority and poor student population (Thomas, 1994)
*No effect on social status
** Many students felt the school uniform policy had little impact on the social dynamic of the school and students found ways to express individuality by making minor alterations to the school uniform (Da Costa, 2006). Some parents and students interviewed in a research about the social aspect of school uniforms said that uniforms were a violation of their rights and freedom. &quot;Like adults, children&#x27;s freedom to choose or to act is also circumscribed by the community – massively so by schools, with their high density, constant supervision and evaluation, lack of privacy, and the obligatory nature of their activities.&quot; (Bodine, 2003)
*Financial concerns
**Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have voiced concerns about the cost of uniforms, specifically that some disadvantaged parents are unable to afford them (Gursky, 1996)
*Questionable effectiveness of those policies
**Strongest opponents of uniform policies charge that no empirical evidence exists to support the numerous and varied claims of uniform proponents (LaPorte, Holoman, &amp; Alleyne, 1992)
**School uniforms suppress students&#x27; individuality by mandating standardization of appearance and removing student expression (Joseph, 1986)
**While uniform policies have been linked to school climate, safety, and student self-perception, there is no evidence to indicate that a uniform policy increases academic achievement (Wade &amp; Stafford, 2003)
Students that do not wear uniforms can be just as successful as students who do wear school uniforms. The amount of effort and participation a student does during class determines their academic success, regardless of what they are wearing. Students who wear school uniforms does not grant them academic achievement.

According to Marian Wilde, additional opponent arguments include that school uniforms:

* Are simply a Band-Aid on the issue of school violence
* Make students a target for bullies from other schools
* Are an unfair additional expense for parents who pay taxes for a free public education
* Are difficult to enforce in state/public (government) schools

<text>The Catilinarian orations (; also simply the &quot;Catilinarians&quot;) are four speeches given in 63 BC by Marcus Tullius Cicero, one of the year&#x27;s consuls. The speeches are all related to the discovery, investigation, and suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy, a plot that year to overthrow the republic. All of the speeches in the form available today were published, probably around 60, as part of Cicero&#x27;s attempt to justify his actions during the consulship; whether they are accurate reflections of the original speeches in 63 is debated.

The first speech was given in the senate, where Cicero accused a senator, Catiline, of leading a plot to overthrow the republic; in response, Catiline withdrew from the city and joined an uprising in Etruria. The next two speeches were given before the people, with Cicero justifying his actions as well as relating further news of the conspiracy in Rome itself and the arrest of four conspirators. The fourth speech, supposedly delivered before the Senate, was an intervention in an on-going debate as to the fate of the urban conspirators; Cicero argued in favour of their illegal execution without trial.

Some modern historians suggest that Catiline was a more complex character than Cicero&#x27;s writings declare, and that Cicero was heavily influenced by a desire to establish a lasting reputation as a great Roman patriot and statesman. The Catilinarian orations, along with Sallust&#x27;s monograph &quot;Bellum Catilinae&quot;, make the conspiracy one of the best-documented events from the ancient world; for centuries after their delivery, the Catilinarians were praised as model speeches and taught as part of the standard Latin rhetorical curriculum.

==Background==
The Catilinarian conspiracy was a plot by the patrician senator Lucius Sergius Catilina (known in English as Catiline) to overthrow the Roman republic. He started this plot in 63 BC after being repulsed at elections for consul for the third time; after failing to be elected to the consulships of 65, 63, and 62 BC. The conspirators included various disaffected groups. The aristocrats who joined were largely men who were similarly unsuccessful in elections for high office or were otherwise bankrupt. They were joined by many disaffected Italian farmers – concentrated in Etruria – in two broad groups: farmers dispossessed by Sulla&#x27;s proscriptions or colonisation programmes and Sulla&#x27;s landed veterans who had fallen into debt after poor harvests.

The first indications of a plot in 63 BC were in autumn, handed over by Marcus Licinius Crassus on 18 or 19 October. Crassus&#x27; letters were corroborated by reports of armed men gathering in support of the conspiracy. In response, the senate passed a decree declaring a (a state of emergency) and, after receipt of the reports of armed men gathering in Etruria, carried the instructing the consuls to do whatever it took to respond to the crisis. By 27 October, the senate had received reports that Gaius Manlius, a former centurion and leader of an army there, had taken up arms near Faesulae. 

Catiline remained in the city. While named in the anonymous letters sent to Crassus, this was insufficient evidence for incrimination. But after messages from Etruria connected him directly to the uprising, he was indicted under the (public violence) in early November. The conspirators met, probably on 6 November, and found two volunteers to make an attempt on Cicero&#x27;s life. After the attempts on Cicero&#x27;s life failed on 7 November 63 BC, he assembled the senate and delivered the First Catilinarian, revealing Catiline&#x27;s involvement in the plot; Catiline promptly left the city and joined Manlius&#x27; men in Etruria shortly thereafter.

At this time, Cicero then discovered a plot led by one of the sitting praetors, to bring in the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe, to support the Catilinarians. Using the Allobroges&#x27; envoys as double agents, Cicero used them to identify conspirators in the city. After intercepting incriminating letters between the conspirators and the Allobroges, five conspirators were arrested on 2 or 3 December. With the Gallic envoys divulging all they knew and confessions from the five men, there was no doubt of their guilt. After an attempt to rescue the five men from house arrest, the senate debated their fate on 5 December. After a prolonged debate, the Senate, after momentarily being convinced to sentence the men to life imprisonment without trial by Julius Caesar, advised Cicero to have the urban conspirators summarily executed. After the execution of the urban conspirators, most of Catiline&#x27;s forces melted away; Catiline was eventually defeated and killed in early January 62 BC at the Battle of Pistoria.

At the close of the consular year, Cicero&#x27;s valedictory speech was vetoed by two tribunes of the plebs. One of the tribunes, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos, also sought to bring Cicero up on charges for executing citizens without trial. Although popular among large portions of the people for having taken decisive action to avoid civil war and suppress the coup attempt, Cicero&#x27;s legal position came under attack in the coming years. In response, Cicero attempted to shore up his reputation and justify his actions by publishing his consular speeches: the Catilinarian orations were published after some editing in 60 BC as part of this effort.

== First Catilinarian ==

The First Catilinarian is the most famous speech in Latin literature. Its first sentence in particular is carefully crafted so as to have its form support its content. In consequence, it is still widely remembered and used after more than 2000 years:

Also remembered is the famous exasperated exclamation, &quot;O tempora, o mores!&quot;, used as an exclamation of outrage or indignation as to the state of the republic in Cicero&#x27;s days.

=== Structure and context ===
The First Catilinarian is a denunciation of Catiline, delivered before the Senate in the Temple of Jupiter Stator on 7 or 8 November 63 BC. The Senate met to discuss an attempt on Cicero&#x27;s life. Whether the speech is entirely historical is not entirely clear: the Second Catilinarian depicts Cicero&#x27;s first speech as a simple interrogatory rather than the extended denunciation that survives. Unlike the other speeches, most of the speech is directed to Catiline personally with concluding remarks addressed to the Senate.

Categorisation of the speech into one of the genres of ancient rhetoric is difficult. The denunciatory aspects of the speech are couched in the framework of a senatorial address while also largely being delivered to Catiline&#x27;s person. Scholars disagree as to whether it should be seen as a speech in the genre of the law courts (forensic or prosecutorial) or otherwise in the genre of senatorial rhetoric (deliberative). This difficulty may be due to its original extemporaneous nature, delivered not in as part of a structured meeting but rather on the Catiline&#x27;s arrival to the senate.

The oration&#x27;s arguments, somewhat cloudy and meandering, are intended more to influence senatorial opinion than argue in favour of any specific course of action or actually advise Catiline. Cicero, in a letter, later described it as a farewell; Berry, in &quot;Cicero&#x27;s Catilinarians&quot;, argues that Cicero had to dress up inaction since, within the bounds of the law, he had limited authority to act against Catiline proactively. A more retrospective interpretation of how it would have played would instead emphasise how Cicero chose to act slowly and deliberatively rather than, as alleged by his political enemies, cruelly and autocratically.

=== Content ===
Cicero starts the speech by informing Catiline that the conspiracy is revealed and that Cicero would be within his rights as consul and justified by precedent to have Catiline killed as a threat to the state. Cicero then connects Catiline to the rebels in Etruria, against which the Senate had already mobilised men; Cicero also disclaims any intention to have Catiline killed since it would be controversial, something possibly inserted in 60 BC to paint Cicero as merciful and rebut allegations of cruelty. Cicero then describes at length the conspiracy before urging Catiline to leave the city with his followers to take command of the Etrurian rebels, something which Cicero asserts Catiline was to do shortly regardless. Catiline likely asked whether Cicero&#x27;s advice was a command for him to go into exile—the power to exile citizens, , was within consular authority—but Cicero in the speech insists that he is merely advising Catiline to leave.

Insisting that Catiline is not detained by any business in Rome due to his poor reputation, Cicero then engages in invective, indirectly accusing Catiline of a variety of sexual crimes, imminent bankruptcy, and past plots against the state. Drawing attention to how other senators moved away from Catiline when he entered the senate, Cicero argues then that no formal senatorial vote on Catiline&#x27;s exile—which Catiline demanded—was necessary due to the senate&#x27;s obvious displeasure; if it had passed it would have cast Catiline as a victim of senatorial overreach; if it had failed it would have undermined Cicero&#x27;s position in the senate. This political isolation is then emphasised when Cicero relates that Catiline sought to place himself into voluntary custody to service his reputation but found nobody willing to take him. Such isolation is further illustrated noting how the Senate&#x27;s did not voice any immediate objections to the idea of exiling Catiline.

Changing tack, Cicero then tells Catiline that if he leaves the city but, contrary to Catiline&#x27;s existing plans, does not join the rebels in Etruria, Cicero would be seen as having forced an innocent man to go into exile. This argument was meant to paint Cicero in an unselfish light. An outburst of invective against Catiline and his followers, who Cicero brands as corrupt and bankrupt political failures, then follows. The conclusion of the speech notes that Cicero intends to do nothing compulsory at the moment, justified by rejection of arguments to have Catiline summarily executed (placed in the mouth of an abstract personification of Rome). Cicero instead seeks a longer term goals of ensuring that—by allowing Catiline to join the Etrurian rebels—the whole Senate is convinced of Catiline&#x27;s guilt and that, when the rebels are defeated with Catiline and followers among them, the body politic is improved by their absence. The speech finally concludes with a prayer to Jupiter Stator that Catiline and his followers be defeated.

== Second Catilinarian ==
Cicero informed the citizens of Rome that Catiline had left the city not into exile, as Catiline had said, but to join with his illegal army. He described the conspirators as rich men who were in debt, men eager for power and wealth, Sulla&#x27;s veterans, ruined men who hoped for any change, criminals, profligates and other men of Catiline&#x27;s ilk. He assured the people of Rome that they had nothing to fear because he, as consul, and the gods would protect the state. This speech was delivered with the intention of convincing the lower class, or common man, that Catiline would not represent their interests and they should not support him.

Meanwhile, Catiline joined up with Gaius Manlius, commander of the rebel force. When the Senate was informed of the developments, they declared the two of them public enemies. Antonius Hybrida (Cicero&#x27;s fellow consul), with troops loyal to Rome, followed Catiline while Cicero remained at home to guard the city.

== Third Catilinarian ==
Cicero claimed that the city should rejoice because it had been saved from a bloody rebellion. He presented evidence that all of Catiline&#x27;s accomplices confessed to their crimes. He asked for nothing for himself but the grateful remembrance of the city and acknowledged that the victory was more difficult than one in foreign lands because the enemies were citizens of Rome.

== Fourth Catilinarian ==


In his fourth and final published argument, which took place in the Temple of Concordia, Cicero establishes a basis for other orators (primarily Cato the Younger) to argue for the execution of the conspirators. As consul, Cicero was formally not allowed to voice any opinion in the matter, but he circumvented the rule with subtle oratory. Although very little is known about the actual debate (except for Cicero&#x27;s argument, which has probably been altered from its original), the Senate majority probably opposed the death sentence for various reasons, one of which was the nobility of the accused. For example, Julius Caesar argued that exile and disenfranchisement would be sufficient punishment for the conspirators, and one of the accused, Lentulus, was a praetor. However, after the combined efforts of Cicero and Cato, the vote shifted in favor of execution, and the sentence was carried out shortly afterwards.

While some historians agree that Cicero&#x27;s actions, in particular the final speeches before the Senate, may have saved the Republic, they also reflect his self-aggrandisement and, to a certain extent envy, probably born out of the fact that he was considered a &quot;novus homo&quot;, a Roman citizen without noble or ancient lineage.

<text>A cotyledon ( ; ; &quot;a cavity, small cup, any cup-shaped hollow&quot;,
gen. (), ) is a &quot;seed leaf&quot; – a significant part of the embryo within the seed of a plant – and is formally defined as &quot;the embryonic leaf in seed-bearing plants, one or more of which are the first to appear from a germinating seed.&quot; Botanists use the number of cotyledons present as one characteristic to classify the flowering plants (angiosperms): species with one cotyledon are called monocotyledonous (&quot;monocots&quot;); plants with two embryonic leaves are termed dicotyledonous (&quot;dicots&quot;). Be it noted that many orchids with minute seeds have no identifiable cotyledon, and are regarded as acotyledons. The Dodders (Cuscuta spp) also lack cotyledons.

In the case of dicot seedlings whose cotyledons are photosynthetic, the cotyledons are functionally similar to leaves. However, true leaves and cotyledons are developmentally distinct. Cotyledons form during embryogenesis, along with the root and shoot meristems, and are therefore present in the seed prior to germination. True leaves, however, form post-embryonically (i.e. after germination) from the shoot apical meristem, which generates subsequent aerial portions of the plant.

The cotyledon of grasses and many other monocotyledons is a highly modified leaf composed of a &quot;scutellum&quot; and a &quot;coleoptile&quot;. The scutellum is a tissue within the seed that is specialized to absorb stored food from the adjacent endosperm. The coleoptile is a protective cap that covers the &quot;plumule&quot; (precursor to the stem and leaves of the plant).

Gymnosperm seedlings also have cotyledons. Gnetophytes, cycads, and ginkgos all have 2, whereas in conifers they are often variable in number (multicotyledonous), with 2 to 24 cotyledons forming a whorl at the top of the hypocotyl (the embryonic stem) surrounding the plumule. Within each species, there is often still some variation in cotyledon numbers, e.g. Monterey pine (&quot;Pinus radiata&quot;) seedlings have between 5 and 9, and Jeffrey pine (&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot;) 7 to 13 (Mirov 1967), but other species are more fixed, with e.g. Mediterranean cypress always having just two cotyledons. The highest number reported is for big-cone pinyon (&quot;Pinus maximartinezii&quot;), with 24 (Farjon &amp; Styles 1997).

Cotyledons may be ephemeral, lasting only days after emergence, or persistent, enduring at least a year on the plant. The cotyledons contain (or in the case of gymnosperms and monocotyledons, have access to) the stored food reserves of the seed. As these reserves are used up, the cotyledons may turn green and begin photosynthesis, or may wither as the first true leaves take over food production for the seedling.

==Epigeal versus hypogeal development==

Cotyledons may be either epigeal, expanding on the germination of the seed, throwing off the seed shell, rising above the ground, and perhaps becoming photosynthetic; or hypogeal, not expanding, remaining below ground and not becoming photosynthetic. The latter is typically the case where the cotyledons act as a storage organ, as in many nuts and acorns.

Hypogeal plants have (on average) significantly larger seeds than epigeal ones. They are also capable of surviving if the seedling is clipped off, as meristem buds remain underground (with epigeal plants, the meristem is clipped off if the seedling is grazed). The tradeoff is whether the plant should produce a large number of small seeds, or a smaller number of seeds which are more likely to survive.

The ultimate development of the epigeal habit is represented by a few plants, mostly in the family Gesneriaceae in which the cotyledon persists for a lifetime. Such a plant is &quot;Streptocarpus wendlandii&quot; of South Africa in which one cotyledon grows to be up to 75 centimeters (2.5 feet) in length and up to 61 cm (two feet) in width (the largest cotyledon of any dicot, and exceeded only by &quot;Lodoicea&quot;). Adventitious flower clusters form along the midrib of the cotyledon. The second cotyledon is much smaller and ephemeral.

Related plants may show a mixture of hypogeal and epigeal development, even within the same plant family. Groups which contain both hypogeal and epigeal species include, for example, the Southern Hemisphere conifer family Araucariaceae, the pea family, Fabaceae, and the genus &quot;Lilium&quot; (see Lily seed germination types). The frequently garden grown common bean, &quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot;, is epigeal, while the closely related runner bean, &quot;Phaseolus coccineus&quot;, is hypogeal.

==History==
The term &quot;cotyledon&quot; was coined by Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694). John Ray was the first botanist to recognize that some plants have two and others only one, and eventually the first to recognize the immense importance of this fact to systematics, in &quot;Methodus plantarum&quot; (1682).

Theophrastus (3rd or 4th century BC) and Albertus Magnus (13th century) may also have recognized the distinction between the dicotyledons and monocotyledons.

<text>Monocotyledons (), commonly referred to as monocots, ([[Lilianae]] &quot;sensu&quot; Chase &amp; Reveal) are flowering plants whose seeds contain only one embryonic leaf, or cotyledon. A monocot taxon has been in use for several decades, but with various ranks and under several different names. The APG IV system recognises its monophyly but does not assign it to a taxonomic rank, and instead uses the term &quot;monocots&quot; to refer to the group. 

Monocotyledons are contrasted with the dicotyledons, which have two cotyledons. Unlike the monocots however, the dicots are not monophyletic and the two cotyledons are instead the ancestral characteristic of all flowering plants. Botanists now classify dicots into the eudicots (&quot;true dicots&quot;) and several basal lineages from which the monocots emerged.

The monocots are extremely important economically, culturally, and ecologically, and make up a majority of plant biomass used in agriculture. Common crops such as dates, onions, garlic, rice, wheat, maize, and sugarcane are all monocots. The grasses alone cover over 40% of Earth&#x27;s land area and contribute a significant portion of the human diet. Other monocots, like orchids, tulips, daffodils, and lilies are common houseplants and have been the subjects of several celebrations, holidays, and artworks for thousands of years.

==Description==
The monocots have, as the name implies, a single (mono-) cotyledon, or embryonic leaf, in their seeds. Historically, this feature was used to contrast the monocots with the dicotyledons or dicots which typically have two cotyledons; however, modern research has shown that the dicots are paraphyletic. From a diagnostic point of view the number of cotyledons is neither a particularly useful characteristic (as they are only present for a very short period in a plant&#x27;s life), nor is it completely reliable. The single cotyledon is only one of a number of modifications of the body plan of the ancestral monocotyledons, whose adaptive advantages are poorly understood, but may have been related to adaption to aquatic habitats, prior to radiation to terrestrial habitats. Nevertheless, monocots are sufficiently distinctive that there has rarely been disagreement as to membership of this group, despite considerable diversity in terms of external morphology.

With over 70,000 species, monocots are extremely evolutionarily successful and occupy a diverse set of niches: Perennial geophytes including orchids (Asparagales); tulips and lilies (Liliales); rosette and succulent epiphytes (Asparagales); mycoheterotrophs (Liliales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales), all in the lilioid monocots; major cereal grains (maize, rice, barley, rye, oats, millet, sorghum and wheat) in the grass family; and forage grasses (Poales) as well as woody tree-like palm trees (Arecales), bamboo, reeds and bromeliads (Poales), bananas and ginger (Zingiberales) in the commelinid monocots, as well as floating or submerged aquatic plants such as seagrass (Alismatales) are all monocots.

=== Vegetative ===
====Organisation, growth and life forms====
The most important distinction is their growth pattern, lacking a lateral meristem (cambium) that allows for continual growth in diameter with height (secondary growth), and therefore this characteristic is a basic limitation in shoot construction. Although largely herbaceous, some arboraceous monocots reach great height, length and mass. The latter include agaves, palms, pandans, and bamboos. This creates challenges in water transport that monocots deal with in various ways. Some, such as species of &quot;Yucca&quot;, develop anomalous secondary growth, while palm trees utilise an anomalous primary growth form described as establishment growth (&quot;see&quot; Vascular system). The axis undergoes primary thickening, that progresses from internode to internode, resulting in a typical inverted conical shape of the basal primary axis (&quot;see&quot; Tillich, Figure 1). The limited conductivity also contributes to limited branching of the stems. Despite these limitations a wide variety of adaptive growth forms has resulted (Tillich, Figure 2) from epiphytic orchids (Asparagales) and bromeliads (Poales) to submarine Alismatales (including the reduced Lemnoideae) and mycotrophic Burmanniaceae (Dioscreales) and Triuridaceae (Pandanales). Other forms of adaptation include the climbing vines of Araceae (Alismatales) which use negative phototropism (skototropism) to locate host trees (&quot;i.e.&quot; the darkest area), while some palms such as &quot;Calamus manan&quot; (Arecales) produce the longest shoots in the plant kingdom, up to 185 m long. Other monocots, particularly Poales, have adopted a therophyte life form.

====Leaves====

The cotyledon, the primordial Angiosperm leaf consists of a proximal leaf base or hypophyll and a distal hyperphyll. In monocots the hypophyll tends to be the dominant part in contrast to other angiosperms. From these, considerable diversity arises. Mature monocot leaves are generally narrow and linear, forming a sheathing around the stem at its base, although there are many exceptions. Leaf venation is of the striate type, mainly arcuate-striate or longitudinally striate (parallel), less often palmate-striate or pinnate-striate with the leaf veins emerging at the leaf base and then running together at the apices. There is usually only one leaf per node because the leaf base encompasses more than half the circumference. The evolution of this monocot characteristic has been attributed to developmental differences in early zonal differentiation rather than meristem activity (leaf base theory).

====Roots and underground organs====
The lack of cambium in the primary root limits its ability to grow sufficiently to maintain the plant. This necessitates early development of roots derived from the shoot (adventitious roots). In addition to roots, monocots develop runners and rhizomes, which are creeping shoots. Runners serve vegetative propagation, have elongated internodes, run on or just below the surface of the soil and in most case bear scale leaves. Rhizomes frequently have an additional storage function and rhizome producing plants are considered geophytes (Tillich, Figure 11). Other geophytes develop bulbs, a short axial body bearing leaves whose bases store food. Additional outer non-storage leaves may form a protective function (Tillich, Figure 12). Other storage organs may be tubers or corms, swollen axes. Tubers may form at the end of underground runners and persist. Corms are short lived vertical shoots with terminal inflorescences and shrivel once flowering has occurred. However, intermediate forms may occur such as in &quot;Crocosmia&quot; (Asparagales). Some monocots may also produce shoots that grow directly down into the soil, these are shoots (Tillich, Figure 11) that help overcome the limited trunk stability of large woody monocots.

=== Reproductive ===
====Flowers====
In nearly all cases the perigone consists of two alternating trimerous whorls of tepals, being , without differentiation between calyx and corolla. In (pollinated by animals) taxa, both whorls are corolline (petal-like). Anthesis (the period of flower opening) is usually (short lived). Some of the more persistent perigones demonstrate thermonastic opening and closing (responsive to changes in temperature). About two thirds of monocots are zoophilous, predominantly by insects. These plants need to advertise to pollinators and do so by way of phaneranthous (showy) flowers. Such optical signalling is usually a function of the tepal whorls but may also be provided by semaphylls (other structures such as filaments, staminodes or stylodia which have become modified to attract pollinators). However, some monocot plants may have aphananthous (inconspicuous) flowers and still be pollinated by animals. In these the plants rely either on chemical attraction or other structures such as coloured bracts fulfill the role of optical attraction. In some phaneranthous plants such structures may reinforce floral structures. The production of fragrances for olfactory signalling are common in monocots. The perigone also functions as a landing platform for pollinating insects.
====Fruit and seed====
The embryo consists of a single cotyledon, usually with two vascular bundles.

===Comparison with dicots===
The traditionally listed differences between monocots and dicots are as follows. This is a broad sketch only, not invariably applicable, as there are a number of exceptions. The differences indicated are more true for monocots versus eudicots.


A number of these differences are not unique to the monocots, and, while still useful, no one single feature will infallibly identify a plant as a monocot. For example, trimerous flowers and monosulcate pollen are also found in magnoliids, and exclusively adventitious roots are found in some of the Piperaceae. Similarly, at least one of these traits, parallel leaf veins, is far from universal among the monocots. Broad leaves and reticulate leaf veins, features typical of dicots, are found in a wide variety of monocot families: for example, &quot;Trillium&quot;, &quot;Smilax&quot; (greenbriar), &quot;Pogonia&quot; (an orchid), and the Dioscoreales (yams). &quot;Potamogeton&quot; and &quot;Paris quadrifolia&quot; (herb-paris) are examples of monocots with tetramerous flowers. Other plants exhibit a mixture of characteristics. Nymphaeaceae (water lilies) have reticulate veins, a single cotyledon, adventitious roots, and a monocot-like vascular bundle. These examples reflect their shared ancestry. Nevertheless, this list of traits is generally valid, especially when contrasting monocots with eudicots, rather than non-monocot flowering plants in general.

=== Apomorphies ===

Monocot apomorphies (characteristics derived during radiation rather than inherited from an ancestral form) include herbaceous habit, leaves with parallel venation and sheathed base, an embryo with a single cotyledon, an atactostele, numerous adventitious roots, sympodial growth, and trimerous (3 parts per whorl) flowers that are pentacyclic (5 whorled) with 3 sepals, 3 petals, 2 whorls of 3 stamens each, and 3 carpels. In contrast, monosulcate pollen is considered an ancestral trait, probably plesiomorphic.

=== Synapomorphies ===

The distinctive features of the monocots have contributed to the relative taxonomic stability of the group. Douglas E. Soltis and others identify thirteen synapomorphies (shared characteristics that unite monophyletic groups of taxa);
# Calcium oxalate raphides
# Absence of vessels in leaves
# Monocotyledonous anther wall formation*
# Successive microsporogenesis
# Syncarpous gynoecium
# Parietal placentation
# Monocotyledonous seedling
# Persistent radicle
# Haustorial cotyledon tip
# Open cotyledon sheath
# Steroidal saponins*
# Fly pollination*
# Diffuse vascular bundles and absence of secondary growth
===Vascular system===
Monocots have a distinctive arrangement of vascular tissue known as an atactostele in which the vascular tissue is scattered rather than arranged in concentric rings. Collenchyma is absent in monocot stems, roots and leaves. Many monocots are herbaceous and do not have the ability to increase the width of a stem (secondary growth) via the same kind of vascular cambium found in non-monocot woody plants. However, some monocots do have secondary growth; because this does not arise from a single vascular cambium producing xylem inwards and phloem outwards, it is termed &quot;anomalous secondary growth&quot;. Examples of large monocots which either exhibit secondary growth, or can reach large sizes without it, are palms (Arecaceae), screwpines (Pandanaceae), bananas (Musaceae), &quot;Yucca&quot;, &quot;Aloe&quot;, &quot;Dracaena&quot;, and &quot;Cordyline&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

===Early history===

==== Pre-Linnean ====

Monocots were first recognized as a group in Matthias de l&#x27;Obel&#x27;s &quot;Stirpium adversaria nova&quot;. Searching for non-pharmacological characteristics to classify plants by, he chose on leaf form and venation, and observed that the majority of plants had broad leaves with net-like venation, but some had long and straight leaves with parallel veins. He did not decide on any formal name for the two groups he discovered, and his new classification scheme did not receive much appraisal and only saw moderate success within academic circles.

Formal description dates from John Ray&#x27;s studies of seed structure in the 17th century. Ray, who is often considered the first botanical systematist, observed the dichotomy of cotyledon structure in his examination of seeds. He reported his findings in a paper read to the Royal Society on 17 December 1674, entitled &quot;A Discourse on the Seeds of Plants&quot;.
 Since this paper appeared a year before the publication of Malpighi&#x27;s &quot;Anatome Plantarum&quot; (1675–1679), Ray has the priority. At the time, Ray did not fully realise the importance of his discovery but progressively developed this over successive publications. And since these were in Latin, &quot;seed leaves&quot; became &quot;folia seminalia&quot; and then &quot;cotyledon&quot;, following Malpighi. Malpighi and Ray were familiar with each other&#x27;s work, and Malpighi in describing the same structures had introduced the term cotyledon, which Ray adopted in his subsequent writing.
 In this experiment, Malpighi also showed that the cotyledons were critical to the development of the plant, proof that Ray required for his theory. In his &quot;Methodus plantarum nova&quot; Ray also developed and justified the &quot;natural&quot; or pre-evolutionary approach to classification, based on characteristics selected &quot;a posteriori&quot; in order to group together taxa that have the greatest number of shared characteristics. This approach, also referred to as polythetic would last till evolutionary theory enabled Eichler to develop the phyletic system that superseded it in the late nineteenth century, based on an understanding of the acquisition of characteristics. He also made the crucial observation &quot;Ex hac seminum divisione sumum potest generalis plantarum distinctio, eaque meo judicio omnium prima et longe optima, in eas sci. quae plantula seminali sunt bifolia aut διλόβω, et quae plantula sem. adulta analoga.&quot; (From this division of the seeds derives a general distinction amongst plants, that in my judgement is first and by far the best, into those seed plants which are bifoliate, or bilobed, and those that are analogous to the adult), that is between monocots and dicots. He illustrated this by quoting from Malpighi and including reproductions of Malpighi&#x27;s drawings of cotyledons (see figure). Initially Ray did not develop a classification of flowering plants (florifera) based on a division by the number of cotyledons, but developed his ideas over successive publications, coining the terms &quot;Monocotyledones&quot; and &quot;Dicotyledones&quot; in 1703, in the revised version of his &quot;Methodus&quot; (&quot;Methodus plantarum emendata&quot;), as a primary method for dividing them, &quot;Herbae floriferae, dividi possunt, ut diximus, in Monocotyledones &amp; Dicotyledones&quot; (Flowering plants, can be divided, as we have said, into Monocotyledons &amp; Dicotyledons).

==== Post Linnean ====

Although Linnaeus (1707–1778) did not utilise Ray&#x27;s discovery, basing his own classification solely on floral reproductive morphology, the term was used shortly after his classification appeared (1753) by Scopoli and who is credited for its introduction. Every taxonomist since then, starting with De Jussieu and De Candolle, has used Ray&#x27;s distinction as a major classification characteristic. In De Jussieu&#x27;s system (1789), he followed Ray, arranging his Monocotyledones into three classes based on stamen position and placing them between Acotyledones and Dicotyledones. De Candolle&#x27;s system (1813) which was to predominate thinking through much of the 19th century used a similar general arrangement, with two subgroups of his &quot;Monocotylédonés&quot; (Monocotyledoneae). Lindley (1830) followed De Candolle in using the terms Monocotyledon and Endogenae interchangeably. They considered the monocotyledons to be a group of vascular plants (&quot;Vasculares&quot;) whose vascular bundles were thought to arise from within (&quot;Endogènes&quot; or endogenous).

Monocotyledons remained in a similar position as a major division of the flowering plants throughout the nineteenth century, with minor variations. George Bentham and Hooker (1862–1883) used Monocotyledones, as would Wettstein, while August Eichler used Mononocotyleae and Engler, following de Candolle, Monocotyledoneae. In the twentieth century, some authors used alternative names such as Bessey&#x27;s (1915) Alternifoliae and Cronquist&#x27;s (1966) Liliatae. Later (1981) Cronquist changed Liliatae to Liliopsida, usages also adopted by Takhtajan simultaneously. Thorne (1992) and Dahlgren (1985) also used Liliidae as a synonym.

Taxonomists had considerable latitude in naming this group, as the Monocotyledons were a group above the rank of family. Article 16 of the &quot;ICBN&quot; allows either a descriptive botanical name or a name formed from the name of an included family.

In summary they have been variously named, as follows:
* class Monocotyledoneae in the de Candolle system and the Engler system
* class Monocotyledones in the Bentham &amp; Hooker system and the Wettstein system
* class Monocotyleae in the Eichler system
* class Liliatae then Liliopsida in the Takhtajan system and the Cronquist system
* subclass Liliidae in the Dahlgren system and the Thorne system

=== Modern era ===

Over the 1980s, a more general review of the classification of angiosperms was undertaken. The 1990s saw considerable progress in plant phylogenetics and cladistic theory, initially based on &quot;rbcL&quot; gene sequencing and cladistic analysis, enabling a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for the flowering plants. The establishment of major new clades necessitated a departure from the older but widely used classifications such as Cronquist and Thorne, based largely on morphology rather than genetic data. These developments complicated discussions on plant evolution and necessitated a major taxonomic restructuring.

This DNA based molecular phylogenetic research confirmed on the one hand that the monocots remained as a well defined monophyletic group or clade, in contrast to the other historical divisions of the flowering plants, which had to be substantially reorganized. No longer could the angiosperms be simply divided into monocotyledons and dicotyledons; it was apparent that the monocotyledons were but one of a relatively large number of defined groups within the angiosperms. Correlation with morphological criteria showed that the defining feature was not cotyledon number but the separation of angiosperms into two major pollen types, uniaperturate (monosulcate and monosulcate-derived) and triaperturate (tricolpate and tricolpate-derived), with the monocots situated within the uniaperturate groups. The formal taxonomic ranking of Monoctyledons thus became replaced with monocots as an informal clade. This is the name that has been most commonly used since the publication of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) system in 1998 and regularly updated since.

Within the angiosperms, there are two major grades, a small early branching basal grade, the basal angiosperms (ANA grade) with three lineages and a larger late branching grade, the core angiosperms (mesangiosperms) with five lineages, as shown in the cladogram.

=== Subdivision===

While the monocotyledons have remained extremely stable in their outer borders as a well-defined and coherent monophylectic group, the deeper internal relationships have undergone considerable flux, with many competing classification systems over time.

Historically, Bentham (1877), considered the monocots to consist of four alliances, Epigynae, Coronariae, Nudiflorae and Glumales, based on floral characteristics. He describes the attempts to subdivide the group since the days of Lindley as largely unsuccessful. Like most subsequent classification systems it failed to distinguish between two major orders, Liliales and Asparagales, now recognised as quite separate. A major advance in this respect was the work of Rolf Dahlgren (1980), which would form the basis of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group&#x27;s (APG) subsequent modern classification of monocot families. Dahlgren who used the alternate name Lilliidae considered the monocots as a subclass of angiosperms characterised by a single cotyledon and the presence of triangular protein bodies in the sieve tube plastids. He divided the monocots into seven superorders, Alismatiflorae, Ariflorae, Triuridiflorae, Liliiflorae, Zingiberiflorae, Commeliniflorae and Areciflorae. With respect to the specific issue regarding Liliales and Asparagales, Dahlgren followed Huber (1969) in adopting a splitter approach, in contrast to the longstanding tendency to view Liliaceae as a very broad sensu lato family. Following Dahlgren&#x27;s untimely death in 1987, his work was continued by his widow, Gertrud Dahlgren, who published a revised version of the classification in 1989. In this scheme the suffix &quot;-florae&quot; was replaced with &quot;-anae&quot; (&quot;e.g.&quot; Alismatanae) and the number of superorders expanded to ten with the addition of Bromelianae, Cyclanthanae and Pandananae.

Molecular studies have both confirmed the monophyly of the monocots and helped elucidate relationships within this group. The APG system does not assign the monocots to a taxonomic rank, instead recognizing a monocots clade. However, there has remained some uncertainty regarding the exact relationships between the major lineages, with a number of competing models (including APG).

The APG system establishes eleven orders of monocots. These form three grades, the alismatid monocots, lilioid monocots and the commelinid monocots by order of branching, from early to late. In the following cladogram numbers indicate crown group (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) divergence times in mya (million years ago).


Of some 70,000 species, by far the largest number (65%) are found in two families, the orchids and grasses. The orchids (Orchidaceae, Asparagales) contain about 25,000 species and the grasses (Poaceae, Poales) about 11,000. Other well known groups within the Poales order include the Cyperaceae (sedges) and Juncaceae (rushes), and the monocots also include familiar families such as the palms (Arecaceae, Arecales) and lilies (Liliaceae, Liliales).

===Evolution===

In prephyletic classification systems monocots were generally positioned between plants other than angiosperms and dicots, implying that monocots were more primitive. With the introduction of phyletic thinking in taxonomy (from the system of Eichler 1875–1878 onwards) the predominant theory of monocot origins was the ranalean (ranalian) theory, particularly in the work of Bessey (1915), which traced the origin of all flowering plants to a Ranalean type, and reversed the sequence making dicots the more primitive group.

The monocots form a monophyletic group arising early in the history of the flowering plants, but the fossil record is meagre. The earliest fossils presumed to be monocot remains date from the early Cretaceous period. For a very long time, fossils of palm trees were believed to be the oldest monocots, first appearing 90 million years ago (mya), but this estimate may not be entirely true. At least some putative monocot fossils have been found in strata as old as the eudicots. The oldest fossils that are unequivocally monocots are pollen from the Late Barremian–Aptian – Early Cretaceous period, about 120-110 million years ago, and are assignable to clade-Pothoideae-Monstereae Araceae; being Araceae, sister to other Alismatales. They have also found flower fossils of Triuridaceae (Pandanales) in Upper Cretaceous rocks in New Jersey, becoming the oldest known sighting of saprophytic/mycotrophic habits in angiosperm plants and among the oldest known fossils of monocotyledons.

Topology of the angiosperm phylogenetic tree could imply that the monocots are among the oldest lineages of angiosperms, which would support the theory that they are just as old as the eudicots. The pollen of the eudicots dates back 125 million years, so the lineage of monocots should be that old too.

==== Molecular clock estimates ====

Kåre Bremer, using rbcL sequences and the mean path length method for estimating divergence times, estimated the age of the monocot crown group (i.e. the time at which the ancestor of today&#x27;s &quot;Acorus&quot; diverged from the rest of the group) as 134 million years. Similarly, Wikström &quot;et al.&quot;, using Sanderson&#x27;s non-parametric rate smoothing approach, obtained ages of 127–141 million years for the crown group of monocots. All these estimates have large error ranges (usually 15-20%), and Wikström &quot;et al.&quot; used only a single calibration point, namely the split between Fagales and Cucurbitales, which was set to 84 Ma, in the late Santonian period. Early molecular clock studies using strict clock models had estimated the monocot crown age to 200 ± 20 million years ago or 160 ± 16 million years, while studies using relaxed clocks have obtained 135-131 million years or 133.8 to 124 million years. Bremer&#x27;s estimate of 134 million years has been used as a secondary calibration point in other analyses. Some estimates place the diversification of the monocots as far back as 150 mya in the Jurassic period.

The lineage that led to monocots (stem group) split from other plants about 136 million years ago or 165-170 million years ago.

====Core group====
The age of the core group of so-called &#x27;nuclear monocots&#x27; or &#x27;core monocots&#x27;, which correspond to all orders except Acorales and Alismatales, is about 131 million years to present, and crown group age is about 126 million years to the present. The subsequent branching in this part of the tree (i.e. Petrosaviaceae, Dioscoreales + Pandanales and Liliales clades appeared), including the crown Petrosaviaceae group may be in the period around 125–120 million years BC (about 111 million years so far), and stem groups of all other orders, including Commelinidae would have diverged about or shortly after 115 million years. These and many clades within these orders may have originated in southern Gondwana, i.e. Antarctica, Australasia, and southern South America.

====Aquatic monocots====
The aquatic monocots of Alismatales have commonly been regarded as &quot;primitive&quot;. They have also been considered to have the most primitive foliage, which were cross-linked as Dioscoreales and Melanthiales. Keep in mind that the &quot;most primitive&quot; monocot is not necessarily &quot;the sister of everyone else&quot;. This is because the ancestral or primitive characters are inferred by means of the reconstruction of character states, with the help of the phylogenetic tree. So primitive characters of monocots may be present in some derived groups. On the other hand, the basal taxa may exhibit many morphological autapomorphies. So although Acoraceae is the sister group to the remaining monocotyledons, the result does not imply that Acoraceae is &quot;the most primitive monocot&quot; in terms of its character states. In fact, Acoraceae is highly derived in many morphological characters, and that is precisely why Acoraceae and Alismatales occupied relatively derived positions in the trees produced by Chase &quot;et al.&quot; and others.

Some authors support the idea of an aquatic phase as the origin of monocots. The phylogenetic position of Alismatales (many water), which occupy a relationship with the rest except the Acoraceae, do not rule out the idea, because it could be &#x27;the most primitive monocots&#x27; but not &#x27;the most basal&#x27;. The Atactostele stem, the long and linear leaves, the absence of secondary growth (see the biomechanics of living in the water), roots in groups instead of a single root branching (related to the nature of the substrate), including sympodial use, are consistent with a water source. However, while monocots were sisters of the aquatic Ceratophyllales, or their origin is related to the adoption of some form of aquatic habit, it would not help much to the understanding of how it evolved to develop their distinctive anatomical features: the monocots seem so different from the rest of angiosperms and it&#x27;s difficult to relate their morphology, anatomy and development and those of broad-leaved angiosperms.

====Other taxa====
In the past, taxa which had petiolate leaves with reticulate venation were considered &quot;primitive&quot; within the monocots, because of the superficial resemblance to the leaves of dicotyledons. Recent work suggests that while these taxa are sparse in the phylogenetic tree of monocots, such as fleshy fruited taxa (excluding taxa with aril seeds dispersed by ants), the two features would be adapted to conditions that evolved together regardless. Among the taxa involved were &quot;Smilax&quot;, &quot;Trillium&quot; (Liliales), &quot;Dioscorea&quot; (Dioscoreales), etc. A number of these plants are vines that tend to live in shaded habitats for at least part of their lives, and this fact may also relate to their shapeless stomata. Reticulate venation seems to have appeared at least 26 times in monocots, and fleshy fruits have appeared 21 times (sometimes lost later); the two characteristics, though different, showed strong signs of a tendency to be good or bad in tandem, a phenomenon described as &quot;concerted convergence&quot; (&quot;coordinated convergence&quot;).

=== Etymology ===
The name monocotyledons is derived from the traditional botanical name &quot;Monocotyledones&quot; or &quot;Monocotyledoneae&quot; in Latin, which refers to the fact that most members of this group have one cotyledon, or embryonic leaf, in their seeds.

== Ecology ==

=== Emergence ===

Some monocots, such as grasses, have hypogeal emergence, where the mesocotyl elongates and pushes the coleoptile (which encloses and protects the shoot tip) toward the soil surface. Since elongation occurs above the cotyledon, it is left in place in the soil where it was planted. 
Many dicots have epigeal emergence, in which the hypocotyl elongates and becomes arched in the soil. As the hypocotyl continues to elongate, it pulls the cotyledons upward, above the soil surface.

== Conservation ==

The IUCN Red List describes four species as extinct, four as extinct in the wild, 626 as possibly extinct, 423 as critically endangered, 632 endangered, 621 vulnerable, and 269 near threatened of 4,492 whose status is known.

== Uses ==

Monocots are among the most important plants economically and culturally, and account for most of the staple foods of the world, such as cereal grains and starchy root crops, and palms, orchids and lilies, building materials, and many medicines. Of the monocots, the grasses are of enormous economic importance as a source of animal and human food, and form the largest component of agricultural species in terms of biomass produced.

Other economically important monocotyledon crops include various palms (Arecaceae), bananas and plantains (Musaceae), gingers and their relatives, turmeric and cardamom (Zingiberaceae), asparagus (Asparagaceae), pineapple (Bromeliaceae), sedges (Cyperaceae) and rushes (Juncaceae), vanilla (Orchidaceae), yam (Dioscoreaceae), taro (Araceae), and leeks, onion and garlic (Amaryllidaceae). Many houseplants are monocotyledon epiphytes. Most of the horticultural bulbs, plants cultivated for their blooms, such as lilies, daffodils, irises, amaryllis, cannas, bluebells and tulips, are monocotyledons.

<text>In mathematics, a linear combination or superposition is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a constant and adding the results (e.g. a linear combination of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; would be any expression of the form &quot;ax&quot; + &quot;by&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are constants). The concept of linear combinations is central to linear algebra and related fields of mathematics. Most of this article deals with linear combinations in the context of a vector space over a field, with some generalizations given at the end of the article.

== Definition==
Let &quot;V&quot; be a vector space over the field &quot;K&quot;. As usual, we call elements of &quot;V&quot; &quot;vectors&quot; and call elements of &quot;K&quot; &quot;scalars&quot;.
If v1...,v&quot;n&quot; are vectors and &quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; are scalars, then the &quot;linear combination of those vectors with those scalars as coefficients&quot; is
:formula_1
There is some ambiguity in the use of the term &quot;linear combination&quot; as to whether it refers to the expression or to its value. In most cases the value is emphasized, as in the assertion &quot;the set of all linear combinations of v1...,v&quot;n&quot; always forms a subspace&quot;. However, one could also say &quot;two different linear combinations can have the same value&quot; in which case the reference is to the expression. The subtle difference between these uses is the essence of the notion of linear dependence: a family &quot;F&quot; of vectors is linearly independent precisely if any linear combination of the vectors in &quot;F&quot; (as value) is uniquely so (as expression). In any case, even when viewed as expressions, all that matters about a linear combination is the coefficient of each v&quot;i&quot;; trivial modifications such as permuting the terms or adding terms with zero coefficient do not produce distinct linear combinations.

In a given situation, &quot;K&quot; and &quot;V&quot; may be specified explicitly, or they may be obvious from context. In that case, we often speak of &quot;a linear combination of the vectors&quot; v1...,v&quot;n&quot;, with the coefficients unspecified (except that they must belong to &quot;K&quot;). Or, if &quot;S&quot; is a subset of &quot;V&quot;, we may speak of &quot;a linear combination of vectors in S&quot;, where both the coefficients and the vectors are unspecified, except that the vectors must belong to the set &quot;S&quot; (and the coefficients must belong to &quot;K&quot;). Finally, we may speak simply of &quot;a linear combination&quot;, where nothing is specified (except that the vectors must belong to &quot;V&quot; and the coefficients must belong to &quot;K&quot;); in this case one is probably referring to the expression, since every vector in &quot;V&quot; is certainly the value of some linear combination.

Note that by definition, a linear combination involves only finitely many vectors (except as described in the section.
However, the set &quot;S&quot; that the vectors are taken from (if one is mentioned) can still be infinite; each individual linear combination will only involve finitely many vectors.
Also, there is no reason that &quot;n&quot; cannot be zero; in that case, we declare by convention that the result of the linear combination is the zero vector in &quot;V&quot;.

== Examples and counterexamples ==
=== Euclidean vectors ===
Let the field &quot;K&quot; be the set R of real numbers, and let the vector space &quot;V&quot; be the Euclidean space R3.
Consider the vectors , and .
Then &quot;any&quot; vector in R3 is a linear combination of e1, e2, and e3.

To see that this is so, take an arbitrary vector (&quot;a&quot;1,&quot;a&quot;2,&quot;a&quot;3) in R3, and write:
:formula_2

=== Functions ===
Let &quot;K&quot; be the set C of all complex numbers, and let &quot;V&quot; be the set CC(&quot;R&quot;) of all continuous functions from the real line R to the complex plane C.
Consider the vectors (functions) &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; defined by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) := &quot;e&quot;&quot;it&quot; and &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) := &quot;e&quot;−&quot;it&quot;.
(Here, &quot;e&quot; is the base of the natural logarithm, about 2.71828..., and &quot;i&quot; is the imaginary unit, a square root of −1.)
Some linear combinations of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are:
*formula_3 
*formula_4 
On the other hand, the constant function 3 is &quot;not&quot; a linear combination of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;. To see this, suppose that 3 could be written as a linear combination of &quot;e&quot;&quot;it&quot; and &quot;e&quot;−&quot;it&quot;. This means that there would exist complex scalars &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that for all real numbers &quot;t&quot;. Setting &quot;t&quot; = 0 and &quot;t&quot; = π gives the equations and , and clearly this cannot happen. See Euler&#x27;s identity.

=== Polynomials ===
Let &quot;K&quot; be R, C, or any field, and let &quot;V&quot; be the set &quot;P&quot; of all polynomials with coefficients taken from the field &quot;K&quot;.
Consider the vectors (polynomials) &quot;p&quot;1 := 1, , and .

Is the polynomial &quot;x&quot;2 − 1 a linear combination of &quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2, and &quot;p&quot;3?
To find out, consider an arbitrary linear combination of these vectors and try to see when it equals the desired vector &quot;x&quot;2 − 1.
Picking arbitrary coefficients &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, and &quot;a&quot;3, we want
:formula_5
Multiplying the polynomials out, this means
:formula_6 
and collecting like powers of &quot;x&quot;, we get
:formula_7 
Two polynomials are equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients are equal, so we can conclude
:formula_8 
This system of linear equations can easily be solved.
First, the first equation simply says that &quot;a&quot;3 is 1.
Knowing that, we can solve the second equation for &quot;a&quot;2, which comes out to −1.
Finally, the last equation tells us that &quot;a&quot;1 is also −1.
Therefore, the only possible way to get a linear combination is with these coefficients.
Indeed,
:formula_9
so &quot;x&quot;2 − 1 &quot;is&quot; a linear combination of &quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2, and &quot;p&quot;3.

On the other hand, what about the polynomial &quot;x&quot;3 − 1? If we try to make this vector a linear combination of &quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2, and &quot;p&quot;3, then following the same process as before, we get the equation

:formula_10

However, when we set corresponding coefficients equal in this case, the equation for &quot;x&quot;3 is
:formula_11 
which is always false.
Therefore, there is no way for this to work, and &quot;x&quot;3 − 1 is &quot;not&quot; a linear combination of &quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2, and &quot;p&quot;3.

== The linear span ==
Take an arbitrary field &quot;K&quot;, an arbitrary vector space &quot;V&quot;, and let v1...,v&quot;n&quot; be vectors (in &quot;V&quot;).
It is interesting to consider the set of &quot;all&quot; linear combinations of these vectors.
This set is called the &quot;linear span&quot; (or just &quot;span&quot;) of the vectors, say &quot;S&quot; = {v1, ..., v&quot;n&quot;}. We write the span of &quot;S&quot; as span(&quot;S&quot;) or sp(&quot;S&quot;):
:formula_12

== Linear independence ==

Suppose that, for some sets of vectors v1...,v&quot;n&quot;,
a single vector can be written in two different ways as a linear combination of them:
:formula_13
This is equivalent, by subtracting these (formula_14), to saying a non-trivial combination is zero:
:formula_15

If that is possible, then v1...,v&quot;n&quot; are called &quot;linearly dependent&quot;; otherwise, they are &quot;linearly independent&quot;.
Similarly, we can speak of linear dependence or independence of an arbitrary set &quot;S&quot; of vectors.

If &quot;S&quot; is linearly independent and the span of &quot;S&quot; equals &quot;V&quot;, then &quot;S&quot; is a basis for &quot;V&quot;.

== Affine, conical, and convex combinations ==
By restricting the coefficients used in linear combinations, one can define the related concepts of affine combination, conical combination, and convex combination, and the associated notions of sets closed under these operations.

Because these are more &quot;restricted&quot; operations, more subsets will be closed under them, so affine subsets, convex cones, and convex sets are &quot;generalizations&quot; of vector subspaces: a vector subspace is also an affine subspace, a convex cone, and a convex set, but a convex set need not be a vector subspace, affine, or a convex cone.

These concepts often arise when one can take certain linear combinations of objects, but not any: for example, probability distributions are closed under convex combination (they form a convex set), but not conical or affine combinations (or linear), and positive measures are closed under conical combination but not affine or linear – hence one defines signed measures as the linear closure.

Linear and affine combinations can be defined over any field (or ring), but conical and convex combination require a notion of &quot;positive&quot;, and hence can only be defined over an ordered field (or ordered ring), generally the real numbers.

If one allows only scalar multiplication, not addition, one obtains a (not necessarily convex) cone; one often restricts the definition to only allowing multiplication by positive scalars.

All of these concepts are usually defined as subsets of an ambient vector space (except for affine spaces, which are also considered as &quot;vector spaces forgetting the origin&quot;), rather than being axiomatized independently.

== Operad theory ==

More abstractly, in the language of operad theory, one can consider vector spaces to be algebras over the operad formula_16 (the infinite direct sum, so only finitely many terms are non-zero; this corresponds to only taking finite sums), which parametrizes linear combinations: the vector formula_17 for instance corresponds to the linear combination formula_18. Similarly, one can consider affine combinations, conical combinations, and convex combinations to correspond to the sub-operads where the terms sum to 1, the terms are all non-negative, or both, respectively. Graphically, these are the infinite affine hyperplane, the infinite hyper-octant, and the infinite simplex. This formalizes what is meant by formula_19 being or the standard simplex being model spaces, and such observations as that every bounded convex polytope is the image of a simplex. Here suboperads correspond to more restricted operations and thus more general theories.

From this point of view, we can think of linear combinations as the most general sort of operation on a vector space – saying that a vector space is an algebra over the operad of linear combinations is precisely the statement that &quot;all possible&quot; algebraic operations in a vector space are linear combinations.

The basic operations of addition and scalar multiplication, together with the existence of an additive identity and additive inverses, cannot be combined in any more complicated way than the generic linear combination: the basic operations are a generating set for the operad of all linear combinations.

Ultimately, this fact lies at the heart of the usefulness of linear combinations in the study of vector spaces.

== Generalizations==
If &quot;V&quot; is a topological vector space, then there may be a way to make sense of certain &quot;infinite&quot; linear combinations, using the topology of &quot;V&quot;.
For example, we might be able to speak of &quot;a&quot;1v1 + &quot;a&quot;2v2 + &quot;a&quot;3v3 + ⋯, going on forever.
Such infinite linear combinations do not always make sense; we call them &quot;convergent&quot; when they do.
Allowing more linear combinations in this case can also lead to a different concept of span, linear independence, and basis.
The articles on the various flavors of topological vector spaces go into more detail about these.

If &quot;K&quot; is a commutative ring instead of a field, then everything that has been said above about linear combinations generalizes to this case without change.
The only difference is that we call spaces like this &quot;V&quot; modules instead of vector spaces.
If &quot;K&quot; is a noncommutative ring, then the concept still generalizes, with one caveat:
since modules over noncommutative rings come in left and right versions, our linear combinations may also come in either of these versions, whatever is appropriate for the given module.
This is simply a matter of doing scalar multiplication on the correct side.

A more complicated twist comes when &quot;V&quot; is a bimodule over two rings, &quot;K&quot;L and &quot;K&quot;R.
In that case, the most general linear combination looks like
:formula_20
where &quot;a&quot;1...,&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; belong to &quot;K&quot;L, &quot;b&quot;1...,&quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; belong to &quot;K&quot;R, and v1,…,v&quot;n&quot; belong to &quot;V&quot;.

<text>In geography, regions, otherwise referred to as areas, zones, lands or territories, are portions of the Earth&#x27;s surface that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. More confined or well bounded portions are called &quot;locations&quot; or &quot;places&quot;.

Apart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features.

As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms. For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on. The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography. Regions are an area or division, especially part of a country or the world having definable characteristics but not always fixed boundaries. 

In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography.

==Globalization==

Global regions are distinguishable from space, and are therefore clearly distinguished by the two basic terrestrial environments, land and water. However, they have been generally recognized as such much earlier by terrestrial cartography because of their impact on human geography. They are divided into the largest of land regions, known as continents and the largest of water regions known as oceans. There are also significant regions that do not belong to either classification, such as archipelago regions that are littoral regions, or earthquake regions that are defined in geology.

===Continental regions===
Continental regions are usually based on broad experiences in human history and attempt to reduce very large areas to more manageable regionalization for the purpose of the study. As such they are conceptual constructs, usually lacking distinct boundaries. The oceanic division into maritime regions is used in conjunction with the relationship to the central area of the continent, using directions of the compass.

Some continental regions are defined by the major continental feature of their identity, such as the Amazon basin, or the Sahara, which both occupy a significant percentage of their respective continental land area.

To a large extent, major continental regions are mental constructs created by considering an efficient way to define large areas of the continents. For the most part, the images of the world are derived as much from academic studies, from all types of media, or from personal experience of global exploration. They are a matter of collective human knowledge of their own planet and are attempts to better understand their environments.

===Regional geography===
Regional geography is a branch of geography that studies regions of all sizes across the Earth. It has a prevailing descriptive character. The main aim is to understand or define the uniqueness or character of a particular region, which consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to regionalization, which covers the proper techniques of space delimitation into regions.

Regional geography is also considered as a certain approach to study in geographical sciences (similar to quantitative or critical geographies; for more information, see history of geography).

==Human geography==
Human geography is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape human interaction with various discrete environments. It encompasses human, political, cultural, social, and economic aspects among others that are often clearly delineated. While the major focus of human geography is not the physical landscape of the Earth (see physical geography), it is hardly possible to discuss human geography without referring to the physical landscape on which human activities are being played out, and environmental geography is emerging as a link between the two. Regions of human geography can be divided into many broad categories:
===Historical regions===

The field of historical geography involves the study of human history as it relates to places and regions, or the study of how places and regions have changed over time.

D. W. Meinig, a historical geographer of America, describes many historical regions in his book &quot;The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History&quot;. For example, in identifying European &quot;source regions&quot; in early American colonization efforts, he defines and describes the &quot;Northwest European Atlantic Protestant Region&quot;, which includes sub-regions such as the &quot;Western Channel Community&quot;, which itself is made of sub-regions such as the &quot;English West Country&quot; of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, and Dorset.

In describing historic regions of America, Meinig writes of &quot;The Great Fishery&quot; off the coast of Newfoundland and New England, an oceanic region that includes the Grand Banks. He rejects regions traditionally used in describing American history, like New France, &quot;West Indies&quot;, the Middle Colonies, and the individual colonies themselves (Province of Maryland, for example). Instead he writes of &quot;discrete colonization areas&quot;, which may be named after colonies but rarely adhere strictly to political boundaries. Among other historic regions of this type, he writes about &quot;Greater New England&quot; and its major sub-regions of &quot;Plymouth&quot;, &quot;New Haven shores&quot; (including parts of Long Island), &quot;Rhode Island&quot; (or &quot;Narragansett Bay&quot;), &quot;the Piscataqua&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts Bay&quot;, &quot;Connecticut Valley&quot;, and to a lesser degree, regions in the sphere of influence of Greater New England, &quot;Acadia&quot; (Nova Scotia), &quot;Newfoundland and The Fishery/The Banks&quot;.

Other examples of historical regions are Iroquoia, Ohio Country, Illinois Country, and Rupert&#x27;s Land.

In Russia, historical regions include Siberia and the Russian North, as well as the Ural Mountains. These regions had an identity that developed from the early modern period and led to Siberian regionalism.

=== Tourism region ===

A tourism region is a geographical region that has been designated by a governmental organization or tourism bureau as having common cultural or environmental characteristics. These regions are often named after a geographical, former, or current administrative region or may have a name created for tourism purposes. The names often evoke certain positive qualities of the area and suggest a coherent tourism experience to visitors. Countries, states, provinces, and other administrative regions are often carved up into tourism regions to facilitate attracting visitors.

Some of the more famous tourism regions based on historical or current administrative regions include Tuscany in Italy and Yucatán in Mexico. Famous examples of regions created by a government or tourism bureau include the United Kingdom&#x27;s Lake District and California&#x27;s Wine Country.

===Natural resource regions===
Natural resources often occur in distinct regions. Natural resource regions can be a topic of physical geography or environmental geography, but also have a strong element of human geography and economic geography. A coal region, for example, is a physical or geomorphological region, but its development and exploitation can make it into an economic and a cultural region. Examples of natural resource regions are the Rumaila Field, the oil field that lies along the border or Iraq and Kuwait and played a role in the Gulf War; the Coal Region of Pennsylvania, which is a historical region as well as a cultural, physical, and natural resource region; the South Wales Coalfield, which like Pennsylvania&#x27;s coal region is a historical, cultural, and natural region; the Kuznetsk Basin, a similarly important coal mining region in Russia; Kryvbas, the economic and iron ore mining region of Ukraine; and the James Bay Project, a large region of Quebec where one of the largest hydroelectric systems in the world has been developed.

===Religious regions===
Sometimes a region associated with a religion is given a name, like Christendom, a term with medieval and renaissance connotations of Christianity as a sort of social and political polity. The term Muslim world is sometimes used to refer to the region of the world where Islam is dominant. These broad terms are somewhat vague when used to describe regions.

Within some religions there are clearly defined regions. The Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and others, define ecclesiastical regions with names such as diocese, eparchy, ecclesiastical provinces, and parish.

For example, the United States is divided into 32 Roman Catholic ecclesiastical provinces. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod is organized into 33 geographic &quot;districts&quot;, which are subdivided into &quot;circuits&quot; (the Atlantic District (LCMS), for example). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses regions similar to dioceses and parishes, but uses terms like ward and stake.

===Political regions===

In the field of political geography, regions tend to be based on political units such as sovereign states; subnational units such as administrative regions, provinces, states (in the United States), counties, townships, territories, etc.; and multinational groupings, including formally defined units such as the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and NATO, as well as informally defined regions such as the Third World, Western Europe, and the Middle East.

===Administrative regions===

The word &quot;region&quot; is taken from the Latin &quot;regio&quot; (derived from &quot;regere&quot;, &#x27;to rule&#x27;), and a number of countries have borrowed the term as the formal name for a type of subnational entity (e.g., the , used in Chile). In English, the word is also used as the conventional translation for equivalent terms in other languages (e.g., the &quot;область&quot; (&quot;oblast&quot;), used in Russia alongside a broader term &quot;регион&quot;).

The following countries use the term &quot;region&quot; (or its cognate) as the name of a type of subnational administrative unit:
*Belgium (in French, ; in German, ; the Dutch term is often mistakenly translated as &quot;regio&quot;)
*Chad (, effective from 2002)
*Chile ()
*Côte d&#x27;Ivoire ()
*Denmark (effective from 2007)
*Eritrea
*France ()
*Ghana
*Guinea (&quot;région&quot;)
*Guinea-Bissau (&quot;região&quot;)
*Guyana
*Hungary (&quot;régió&quot;)
*Italy (&quot;regione&quot;)
*Madagascar (&quot;région&quot;)
*Mali (&quot;région&quot;)
*Malta (&quot;reġjun&quot;)
*Namibia
*New Zealand
*Peru ()
*Portugal (&quot;região&quot;)
*Philippines ()
*Senegal ()
*Tanzania
*Thailand
*Togo ()
*Trinidad and Tobago (&quot;Regional Corporation&quot;)
The Canadian province of Québec also uses the &quot;administrative region&quot; (&quot;région administrative&quot;).

Regions of England (not the United Kingdom as a whole) used to be administrative units until 2011. Since then they&#x27;re only used for statistical purposes.

Scotland had local government regions from 1975 to 1996.

In Spain the official name of the autonomous community of Murcia is &quot;Región de Murcia&quot;. Also, some single-province autonomous communities such as Madrid use the term &quot;región&quot; interchangeably with &quot;comunidad autónoma&quot;.

Two län (counties) in Sweden are officially called &#x27;regions&#x27;: Skåne and Västra Götaland, and there is currently a controversial proposal to divide the rest of Sweden into large regions, replacing the current counties.

The government of the Philippines uses the term &quot;region&quot; (in Filipino, ) when it is necessary to group provinces, the primary administrative subdivision of the country. This is also the case in Brazil, which groups its primary administrative divisions (&quot;estados&quot;; &quot;states&quot;) into &quot;grandes regiões&quot; (greater regions) for statistical purposes, while Russia uses &quot;экономические районы&quot; (economic regions) in a similar way, as does Romania and Venezuela.

The government of Singapore makes use of the term &quot;region&quot; for its own administrative purposes.

The following countries use an administrative subdivision conventionally referred to as a region in English:
*Bulgaria, which uses the &quot;област&quot; (&quot;oblast&quot;)
*Greece, which uses the &quot;Περιφέρεια&quot; (&quot;periferia&quot;)
*Russia, which uses the &quot;область&quot; (&quot;oblast&quot;&#x27;), and for some regions the &quot;край&quot; (&quot;krai&quot;)
*Ukraine, which uses the &quot;область&quot; (&quot;oblast&quot;&#x27;)
*Slovakia (&quot;kraj&quot;)

China has five 自治区 (&quot;zìzhìqū&quot;) and two 特別行政區 (or 特别行政区; &quot;tèbiéxíngzhèngqū&quot;), which are translated as &quot;autonomous region&quot; and &quot;special administrative region&quot;, respectively.

====Local administrative regions====
There are many relatively small regions based on local government agencies such as districts, agencies, or regions. In general, they are all regions in the general sense of being bounded spatial units. Examples include electoral districts such as Washington&#x27;s 6th congressional district and Tennessee&#x27;s 1st congressional district; school districts such as Granite School District and Los Angeles Unified School District; economic districts such as the Reedy Creek Improvement District; metropolitan areas such as the Seattle metropolitan area, and metropolitan districts such as the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District, the Metropolitan Police Service of Greater London, as well as other local districts like the York Rural Sanitary District, the Delaware River Port Authority, the Nassau County Soil and Water Conservation District, and C-TRAN.

===Traditional or informal regions===

The traditional territorial divisions of some countries are also commonly rendered in English as &quot;regions&quot;. These informal divisions do not form the basis of the modern administrative divisions of these countries, but still define and delimit local regional identity and sense of belonging. Examples are:

* England
* Finland
* Japan
* Korea
* Norway (&quot;landsdeler&quot;)
* Romania
* Slovakia
* United States

===Functional regions===
Functional regions are usually understood to be the areas organised by the horizontal functional relations (flows, interactions) that are maximised within a region and minimised across its borders so that the principles of internal cohesiveness and external separation regarding spatial interactions are met (see, for instance, Farmer and Fotheringham, 2011; Klapka, Halas, 2016; Smart, 1974). A functional region is not an abstract spatial concept, but to a certain extent it can be regarded as a reflection of the spatial behaviour of individuals in a geographic space. 
The functional region is conceived as a general concept while its inner structure, inner spatial flows, and interactions need not necessarily show any regular pattern, only selfcontainment. The concept of self-containment remains the only crucial defining characteristic of a functional region. Nodal regions, functional urban regions, daily urban systems, local labour-market areas (LLMAs), or travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) are considered to be special instances of a general functional region that need to fulfil some specific conditions regarding, for instance, the character of the region-organising interaction or the presence of urban cores, (Halas et al., 2015).

===Military regions===
In military usage, a region is shorthand for the name of a military formation larger than an Army Group and smaller than a Theater. The full name of the military formation is Army Region. The size of an Army Region can vary widely but is generally somewhere between about 1 million and 3 million soldiers. Two or more Army Regions could make up a Theater. An Army Region is typically commanded by a full General (US four stars), a Field Marshal or General of the Army (US five stars), or Generalissimo (Soviet Union); and in the US Armed Forces an Admiral (typically four stars) may also command a region. Due to the large size of this formation, its use is rarely employed. Some of the very few examples of an Army Region are each of the Eastern, Western, and southern (mostly in Italy) fronts in Europe during World War II. The military map unit symbol for this echelon of formation (see Military organization and APP-6A) is identified with six Xs.

===Media geography===
Media geography is a spatio-temporal understanding, brought through different gadgets of media, nowadays, media became inevitable at different proportions and everyone supposed to consumed at different gravity. The spatial attributes are studied with the help of media outputs in shape of images which are contested in nature and pattern as well where politics is inseparable. Media geography is giving spatial understanding of mediated image.

<text>The European Union created a Committee of the Regions to represent Regions of Europe as the layer of EU government administration directly below the nation-state level. The committee has its headquarters in Brussels.

Reasons given for this include:
* the historic and cultural claims for autonomy in many regions all over the EU
* strengthening the political and economic situation in those regions

Some nation states which have historically had a strong centralized administration have transferred political power to the regions. Examples of this include the current negotiations in France concerning increased autonomy for Corsica. Some other states have traditionally had strong regions, such as the Federal Republic of Germany or the autonomous communities of Spain; yet others have been structured on the basis of national and municipal government with little in between. During the United Kingdom&#x27;s membership of the EU, the term &#x27;region&#x27; also included England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which are formally referred to as countries by the British government.

==Competence==
Regional and local authorities elect delegates to the Committee of the Regions. The committee is a consultative body, and is asked for its opinion by the council or the commission on new policies and legislation in the following areas:
* Education
* Training
* Culture
* Public Health
* Anti-drug support
* Trans-European Networks
* Social and Economic Cohesion
* Structural Funds

On certain issues it works in partnership with the Economic and Social Committee.

== Political influence ==
The politics of regionalism has also had an impact at the pan-European level. The regions of Europe had lobbied for an increased say in EU affairs, especially the German Länder. This resulted in the creation by the Maastricht Treaty of the Committee of the Regions, and provision for member states to be represented in the council by ministers from their regional governments.

The Council of Europe also has a congress of local and regional authorities, similar to the EU&#x27;s Committee of the Regions.

Strengthening economic competition between communities further supports the creation of authentic regions within the EU and almost all EU member states recently have or currently are re-organizing their administration to create competitive EU regions. 
Often these regions better reflect culture and identity and a sense of common interests.

Of the major organisations representing the regions of Europe, the Assembly of European Regions (AER) is the largest. Established in 1985, the organisation now brings together over 270 regions from 33 countries, along with 16 interregional associations, across wider Europe.
Apart from playing a key role as the regions&#x27; political voice on the European stage, AER is a forum for interregional cooperation in numerous areas of regional competence, including economic development, social policy, public health, culture, education and youth. The organisation is also a key defender of the subsidiarity principle in Europe, lobbying for its inclusion in the EU treaties and demanding recognition of the word in dictionaries via the worldwide &quot;Subsidiarity is a word&quot; movement.

Outside EU institutions, the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR-CCRE) is the largest organisation of local and regional government in Europe; its members are national associations of towns, municipalities and regions from over 35 countries. Together these associations represent some 100,000 local and regional authorities.

CEMR works to promote a united Europe that is based on local and regional self-government and democracy. To achieve this goal it endeavours to shape the future of Europe by enhancing local and regional contribution, to influence European law and policy, to exchange experience at local and regional level and to cooperate with partners in other parts of the world.

<text>Luton () is a town and borough in Bedfordshire, England. The borough had a population of 225,262 at the 2021 census. 

Luton is on the River Lea, about north-west of London. The town&#x27;s foundation dates to the sixth century as a Saxon settlement on the river, from which Luton derives its name. Luton is recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Loitone&quot; and &quot;Lintone&quot;. One of the largest churches in Bedfordshire, St Mary&#x27;s Church, was built in the 12th century. There are local museums which explore Luton&#x27;s history in Wardown Park and Stockwood Park.

Luton was once known for hatmaking and also had a large Vauxhall Motors factory. Car production at the plant began in 1905 and continued until its closure in 2002. Production of commercial vehicles continues and the head office of Vauxhall Motors is in the village of Chalton on the northern border of the borough . London Luton Airport opened in 1938 and is now one of Britain&#x27;s major airports, with three railway stations also in the town. The University of Bedfordshire was created from a merger with the University of Luton; two of its campuses are in Luton. Since 1997, Luton Borough Council has been a unitary authority, performing all local government functions in the borough.

Luton Town Football Club, nicknamed the &quot;Hatters&quot;, due to the town&#x27;s connection to hatmaking, has had several spells in the top flight of the English league as well as a Football League Cup triumph in 1988. They play at Kenilworth Road, their home since 1905; planning permission for a new larger stadium was approved in 2019. Luton International Carnival, the largest one-day carnival in Europe, is held on the day before the last Monday in May; the Saint Patrick&#x27;s festival is held on the weekend nearest to Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day as there is a large Irish community in Luton. The town also has a large Pakistani community which, along with the Irish, were attracted to employment at the Vauxhall car plant. Luton Hoo is an English country house, estate and Grade I listed building originally designed by Scottish architect Robert Adam but later transformed to the designs of Robert Smirke.

==History==
Luton is believed to have been founded by the Anglo-Saxons sometime in the 6th century. Its name first appears in the 8th century as &quot;Lygetun&quot;, meaning &quot;town on the River Lea&quot;.

The Domesday Book records Luton as &quot;Loitone&quot; and as &quot;Lintone&quot;. Agriculture dominated the local economy at that time, and the town&#x27;s population was around 700 to 800. 
 
In 1121 Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester started work on St Mary&#x27;s Church in the centre of the town. The work was completed by 1137. A motte-and-bailey castle which gives its name to the modern Castle Street was built in 1139 but demolished by 1154.

The hat making industry began in the 17th century and became synonymous with the town.

The town grew: in 1801 the population was 3,095, but by 1850 it was over 10,000 and by 1901 it was almost 39,000.

Newspaper printing arrived in the town in 1854. The first public cemetery was opened in the same year and Luton was made a borough in 1876.

Luton&#x27;s hat trade reached its peak in the 1930s, but severely declined after the Second World War and was replaced by other industries.

In 1907, Vauxhall Motors opened the largest car plant in the United Kingdom in Luton, during the Second World War, it built Churchill tanks as part of the war effort. Despite heavy camouflage, the factory made Luton a target for the Luftwaffe and the town suffered a number of air raids. 107 died and there was extensive damage to the town (over 1,500 homes were damaged or destroyed).
The original town hall was destroyed in 1919 during Peace Day celebrations at the end of the First World War. Dr. John G. Dony, author of The Flora of Bedfordshire told his history students (he taught at Luton Grammar, predecessor of Luton Sixth Form College), during the 1950s, that he had broken the last intact window of the old town hall during the 1919 riots. Local people, including many ex-servicemen, were unhappy with unemployment and had been refused the use of a local park to hold celebratory events. They stormed the town hall, setting it alight (&quot;see Luton Town Hall&quot;). A replacement building was completed in 1936.

Luton Borough Corporation had provided the borough with electricity since the early twentieth century from Luton power station, located adjacent to the railway. Upon nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership passed to the British Electricity Authority and later to the Central Electricity Generating Board. Electricity connections to the national grid rendered the 23 megawatt (MW) coal and latterly oil-fired power station redundant. The station had a single chimney and two reinforced concrete cooling towers. The power station closed in 1968; in its final year of operation it delivered 3,192 MWh of electricity to the borough.

Luton Airport opened in 1938, owned and operated by the council. It is now one of the largest employers in the area.

The pre-war years, were something of an economic boom for Luton, as new industries grew and prospered. New private and council housing was built in the 1920s and 1930s, with Luton starting to incorporate nearby villages Leagrave, Limbury and Stopsley between 1928 and 1933.

Post-war, a number of substantial estates of council housing were built, notably at Farley Hill, Stopsley, Limbury, Marsh Farm and Leagrave (Hockwell Ring). The Marsh Farm area of the town was developed in the mid to late 1960s as a large council housing estate, mostly to house the overspill population from London. However, the estate gained a reputation for high levels of crime, poverty and unemployment, which culminated in a riot on the estate in July 1992 and another more serious riot three years later.

The partial closure of the Vauxhall manufacturing plant in 2002 had negative effects for Luton, leading to increased unemployment and deprivation. In 2024, Stellantis (owner of the Vauxall marque) announced plans to close its operation in Luton.

==Governance==

There is just one tier of local government covering Luton: Luton Borough Council, which has been a unitary authority since 1997, being a district council which also performs the functions of a county council. There are no civil parishes in the borough. The borough remains part of the ceremonial county of Bedfordshire.

As of the 2024 UK general election, Luton is represented in Parliament by Sarah Owen who holds Luton North and Rachel Hopkins who holds Luton South, both for Labour.

===Administrative history===
Luton was an ancient parish in the Flitt hundred. The parish was the largest in Bedfordshire by area, and was subdivided into five hamlets or townships: Hyde, Leagrave, Limbury, Stopsley, and a Luton township covering the central part of the parish including the town itself. The Luton township was made a local board district in 1850. The local board was the town&#x27;s first elected local authority; previously it had been administered by the parish vestry.

The town was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1876. Later in 1876 the new borough council was granted a coat of arms. The was used on the crest to represent agriculture and the supply of straw used in the local hatmaking industry (the straw plaiting industry was brought to Luton by a group of Scots under the protection of Sir John Napier of Luton Hoo). The bee is traditionally the emblem of industry and the hive represents the straw plaiting industry for which Luton was famous. The rose is from the arms of the Napier family, whereas the thistle is a symbol for Scotland. An alternative suggestion is that the rose was a national emblem, and the thistle represents the Marquess of Bute, who formerly owned the Manor of Luton Hoo.

The Local Government Act 1894 directed that parishes could no longer straddle borough boundaries, and so the ancient parish was split into a Luton parish covering the same area as the borough and a Luton Rural parish covering the area outside the borough. Luton Rural was abolished in 1896 and its area divided into the four parishes of Hyde, Leagrave, Limbury and Stopsley. In 1928 the Leagrave and Limbury parishes were both abolished and their areas absorbed into the borough of Luton; Stopsley was similarly absorbed in 1933. Hyde remains a separate parish, now forming part of Central Bedfordshire.

Luton was made a county borough in 1964, making it independent from Bedfordshire County Council. It was redesignated as a non-metropolitan district in 1974, making it once more subordinate to the county council. In 1997 the borough council was made a unitary authority, regaining its independence from the county council (which was subsequently abolished in 2009).

==Geography==

Luton is situated 28 miles north of London, north-west of Hertford, south of Bedford and south-east of Milton Keynes and 39 miles southwest of Cambridge. The town forms the core part of the wider Luton/Dunstable Urban Area which includes the nearby towns of Dunstable and Houghton Regis in Central Bedfordshire. The town is the most populous settlement in Bedfordshire followed by Bedford.

Luton is located in a break in the eastern part of the Chiltern Hills. The Chilterns are a mixture of chalk from the Cretaceous period (about 66 – 145 million years ago) and deposits laid at the southernmost points of the ice sheet during the last ice age (the Warden Hill area can be seen from much of the town).

Bedfordshire had a reputation for brick making but the industry is now significantly reduced. The brickworks at Stopsley took advantage of the clay deposits in the east of the town.

The source of the River Lea, part of the Thames Valley drainage basin, is in the Leagrave area of the town. The Great Bramingham Wood surrounds this area. It is classified as ancient woodland; records mention the wood at least 400 years ago.

There are few routes through the hilly area for some miles, this has led to several major roads (including the M1 and the A6) and a major rail-link being constructed through the town.

===Climate===
Luton has a temperate marine climate, like much of the British Isles, with generally light precipitation throughout the year. The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream makes the region mild for its latitude. The average total annual rainfall is with rain falling on 117 days of the year.

The local climate around Luton is differentiated somewhat from much of South East England due to its position in the Chiltern Hills, meaning it tends to be 1–2 degrees Celsius cooler than the surrounding towns – often flights at Luton airport, lying above sea level, will be suspended when marginal snow events occur, while airports at lower elevations, such as Heathrow, at above sea level, continue to function. Absolute temperature extremes recorded at Rothamsted Research Station, south south east of Luton town centre and at a similar elevation range from in December 1981 and in January 1963 to in July 2019 and in August 1990 and July 2006. Records for Rothamsted date back to 1901.

==Demography==

The 2021 United Kingdom census showed that the borough had a population of 225,262, a 10.9% increase from the previous census in 2011 and a 22.2% increase compared with 2001. In 2021, 52,566 residents (23% of the total) were aged under 16, 146,330 (65%) were aged 16 to 64, and 26,363 (12%) were aged 65 or over.

Local inhabitants are known as &quot;Lutonians&quot;.

===Ethnicity===

Luton has seen several waves of immigration. In the early part of the 20th century, migrants from Ireland and Scotland came to the town. These were followed by South Asian and Afro-Caribbean immigrants. More recently immigrants from European countries such as Albania have made Luton their home. As a result of this Luton has a diverse ethnic mix, with a significant population of Asian descent, mainly Pakistani (41,143 residents, 18.3%) and Bangladeshi (20,630, 9.2%). People in Asian ethnic groups accounted for 86% of Luton&#x27;s Muslim population in 2021.

As of the 2021 census, the White British (White English, Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish) population of Luton comprised less than a third of the total (31.8%), the twelfth lowest proportion out of 318 local authorities in England and Wales and the second lowest (after Slough) outside of London. Overall, 45.2% of Luton&#x27;s population in 2021 was White (including non-British White people), down from 54.7% in 2011.

In 2011 81% of the population of Luton defined themselves as British.

===Religion===
At the 2021 census, the religious affiliation of Luton was as follows:


==Economy==

Luton&#x27;s economy has traditionally been focused on several different areas of industry, including car manufacturing, engineering and millinery. However, today, Luton is moving towards a service based economy mainly in the retail and the airport sectors, although there is still a focus on light industry in the town.

Notable firms with headquarters in Luton include:
*EasyJet – head office (originally EasyLand, later moved into Hangar 89) and main base at London Luton Airport
*Impellam Group – headquarters at Capability Green
*TUI UK (TUI Airways) – travel (Wigmore House)
*Vauxhall Motors – headquarters (Chalton House)

Notable firms with offices in Luton include:
*Anritsu – electronics
*AstraZeneca – pharmaceuticals
*Selex ES – aerospace
*Ernst &amp; Young – accountants
*Whitbread – hospitality
*Stonegate Pub Company – hospitality

Luton&#x27;s post-war and more recent industrial decline has been compared to that of similar towns in northern England.

===Employment===
Of the town&#x27;s working population (classified 16–74 years of age by the Office for National Statistics), 63% are employed. This figure includes students, the self-employed and those who are in part-time employment. 11% are retired, 8% look after the family or take care of the home and 5% are unemployed.

==Transport==

Luton is situated less than north of the centre of London, giving it good links with the City and other parts of the country via rail and major roads such as the M1 (which serves the town from junctions 10 and 11) and the A6.

The town has three railway stations: Luton, Leagrave and Luton Airport Parkway that are served by East Midlands Railway and Thameslink services.

Luton is also home to London Luton Airport, one of the major feeder airports for London and the south-east. A light metro people mover track, Luton DART, opened in 2023, linking the airport and Luton Airport Parkway railway station.

A network of bus services run by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex, Grant Palmer and Centrebus serves the urban area of Luton and Dunstable. A bus rapid transit route opened in 2013, called the &quot;Luton to Dunstable Busway&quot;, connecting the town with the airport, Dunstable and Houghton Regis. Hertfordshire-based bus operator Uno also run buses on their &#x27;Dragonfly&#x27; 610 route to Hatfield, Potters Bar and Cockforsters

Luton is also served by a large taxi network. As a unitary authority, Luton Borough Council is responsible for the local highways and public transport in the borough and licensing of taxis.

==Education==

Luton is one of the main locations of the University of Bedfordshire. A large campus of the university is in Luton town centre, with a smaller campus based on the edge of town in Putteridge Bury, an old Victorian manor house. The other campuses of the university are located in Bedford, Milton Keynes and Aylesbury.

The town is home to Luton Sixth Form College and Barnfield College. Both have been awarded Learning &amp; Skills Beacon Status by the Department for Children, Schools and Families.

Luton&#x27;s schools and colleges had also been earmarked for major investment in the government scheme Building Schools for the Future programme, which intends to renew and refit buildings in institutes across the country. Luton is in the third wave of this long-term programme with work intending to start in 2009. Some schools were rebuilt before the programme was scrapped by the coalition government.

There are 98 educational institutes in Luton – seven nurseries, 56 primary schools (9 voluntary-aided, 2 special requirements), 13 secondary schools (1 voluntary-aided, 1 special requirements), four further educational institutes and four other educational institutes.

The site was purchased by the Town Council in 1894 for use as a recreation ground and there is reference to it as &#x27;West Ward Recreation Ground&#x27; in a 1911-year book. It is reported as being one of the first two recreation grounds in Luton; the other being East Ward Recreation Ground, now known as Manor Park.

====Kidney Wood====
Kidney Wood is ancient semi-natural woodland on the southern edge of Luton that has been identified as a County Wildlife Site. The wood was purchased by Luton Borough Council as an area of public open space. The council seeks to maintain and enhance the nature conservation interest of Kidney Wood, including its habitats while allowing public access for informal recreation including play. Kidney Wood includes a way marked nature trail and play dells.

====Memorial Park====
Sir Julius Wernher purchased the Luton Hoo Estate and the Manor of Luton from Madame de Falbe around 1903. He carried out substantial renovation works to the Manor and grounds. On his death in 1912 the estate passed to Lady Ludlow. Lady Ludlow presented the Park to the people of Luton on 12 June 1920, in memory of her son Alex Piggott Werner, who was killed in action during the First World War. The site is officially named Luton Hoo Memorial Park. Council records state that the area was purchased under the Statutory Powers of the Public Health Acts.

====Stockwood Park====


Stockwood Park is a large municipal park near Junction 10 of the M1. Located in the park is Stockwood Discovery Centre, a free museum that houses Luton local social history, archaeology and geology. The collection of rural crafts and trades held at Stockwood Discovery Centre was amassed by Thomas Wyatt Bagshawe, who was a notable local historian and a leading authority on folk life. The park has an athletics track, an 18-hole golf course, several rugby and football pitches and areas of open space. Stockwood park is also home to stockwood park RFC, a local amateur rugby team. The park was originally the estate and grounds to Stockwood house, which was demolished in 1964. The museum includes the Mossman Collection of horse-drawn vehicles, which is the largest and most significant vehicle collection of its kind in the country, including originals from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.

====Wardown Park====
Wardown Park is situated on the River Lea in Luton. The park has sporting facilities, is home to the Wardown Park Museum and contains formal gardens. The park is located between &quot;Old Bedford Road&quot; and the A6, &quot;New Bedford Road&quot; and is within walking distance of the town centre. The park houses Wardown House Museum and Gallery, previously known as Luton Museum and Art Gallery, in a large Victorian mansion. The museum collection focuses on the traditional crafts and industry of Luton and Bedfordshire, notably lace making and hatmaking. There are samples of local lace from as early as the 17th century.

===Shopping===
The main shopping area in Luton is centred on the Mall Luton. Built in the 1960s/1970s and opened as an Arndale Centre, construction of the shopping centre led to the demolition of a number of the older buildings in the town centre, including the Plait Halls (a Victorian covered market building with an iron and glass roof). Shops and businesses in the remaining streets, particularly in the roads around Cheapside and in High Town, have been in decline ever since. George Street, on the south side of the Arndale, was pedestrianised in the 1990s.

The shopping centre had some construction and re-design work done to it over the 2011/12 period, with a new square built to be used for leisure events, as well as a number of new food restaurants. Contained within the main shopping centre is the market, which contains butchers, fishmongers, fruit and veg, hairdressers, tattoo parlours, ice cream, a flower stall, T-shirt printing and the market&#x27;s original sewing shop for clothes alterations and repairs as well as eating places.

Another major shopping area is Bury Park where there are shops catering to Luton&#x27;s ethnic minorities.

===Sport===

Luton has a wide range of sports clubs. It is the home town of Luton Town Football Club which in May 2023 achieved promotion to the English Premier League for the first time in their history which also includes several spells in the top flight of the English league as well as a League Cup triumph in 1988. They play at Kenilworth Road, their home since 1905, with a new larger capacity stadium known as Power Court under construction. Their nickname, &#x27;The Hatters&#x27;, dates back to when Luton had a substantial millinery industry, and their logo is based on the town&#x27;s coat of arms.

Bedfordshire County Cricket Club is based at Wardown Park and is one of the county clubs which make up the Minor Counties in the English domestic cricket structure, representing the historic county of Bedfordshire. Luton Rugby Club are a local rugby union club based on Newlands Road, by the M1 motorway just outside Stockwood Park, who play in London 1 North. Speedway racing was once staged at Luton Stadium from 1934 to 1937.

<doc id="55641" wikidata="Q170498" url="?curid=55641" title="Pope Sabinian">
<text>Pope Sabinian () was the bishop of Rome from 13 September 604 to his death on 22 February 606. His pontificate occurred during the Eastern Roman domination of the papacy. He was the fourth former &quot;apocrisiarius&quot; to Constantinople to be elected pope.

==Apocrisiariat==
Sabinian was born at Blera (Bieda) near Viterbo. He had been sent by Pope Gregory I, who had a high opinion of him, as &quot;apocrisiarius&quot; to the imperial court in Constantinople. In 595, Gregory was angered by Sabinian&#x27;s lack of resolution in discussion with Emperor Maurice about the disputed assumption of the title &quot;ecumenical patriarch&quot; by John IV of Constantinople. Sabinian was then recalled and sent on a mission to Gaul the same year. He returned to Rome in 597.

==Pontificate==
Sabinian was elected to succeed Gregory probably in March 604, but had to wait for imperial ratification before being consecrated in September. During his pontificate, Sabinian was seen as a counterfoil to Gregory I. The &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot; praises him for &quot;filling the church with clergy&quot;, in contrast to Gregory, who tended to fill ecclesiastical positions with monks.

Sabinian incurred unpopularity by his unseasonable economies, although the &quot;Liber pontificalis&quot; states that he distributed grain during a famine at Rome under his pontificate. Whereas Gregory distributed grain to the Roman populace as invasion loomed, when the danger had passed Sabinian sold it to them. Because he was unable or unwilling to allow the people to have the grain for little or nothing, there grew up in later times a number of legends in which his predecessor was represented punishing him for avarice. Sabinian died 22 February 606. His funeral procession through the city had to change course to avoid hostile Romans.

Onofrio Panvinio, in his 1557 &quot;Epitome pontificum Romanorum&quot;, attributes to Sabinian the introduction of the custom of ringing bells at the canonical hours and the celebration of the Eucharist, hence expressions such as &quot;o&#x27;clock&quot; (Latin &quot;clocca&quot;: a bell). The first attribution of this was in Guillaume Durand&#x27;s thirteenth-century &quot;Rationale Divinorum Officiorum&quot;.

<doc id="55654" wikidata="Q313327" url="?curid=55654" title="Sun Quan">
<text>Sun Quan (; 182 – 21 May 252), courtesy name Zhongmou (), posthumously known as Emperor Da of Wu, was the founder of Eastern Wu, one of the Three Kingdoms of China. He inherited control of the warlord regime established by his elder brother, Sun Ce, in 200. He declared formal independence and ruled from November 222 to May 229 as the King of Wu and from May 229 to May 252 as the Emperor of Wu. Unlike his rivals Cao Cao and Liu Bei, Sun Quan was much younger and governed his state mostly separate of politics and ideology. He is sometimes portrayed as neutral considering he adopted a flexible foreign policy between his two rivals with the goal of pursuing the greatest interests for the country.

Sun Quan was born while his father Sun Jian served as the adjutant of Xiapi County. After Sun Jian&#x27;s death in the early 190s, he and his family lived at various cities on the lower Yangtze, until Sun Ce carved out a warlord regime in the Jiangdong region, based on his own followers and a number of local clan allegiances. When Sun Ce was assassinated by the retainers of Xu Gong in 200, the 18-year-old Sun Quan inherited the lands southeast of the Yangtze River from his brother. His administration proved to be relatively stable in those early years as Sun Jian and Sun Ce&#x27;s most senior officers, such as Zhou Yu, Zhang Zhao, Zhang Hong, and Cheng Pu supported the succession. Thus throughout the 200s, Sun Quan, under the tutelage of his able advisers, continued to build up his strength along the Yangtze River. In early 207, his forces finally won complete victory over Huang Zu, a military leader under Liu Biao, who dominated the middle Yangtze. Huang Zu was killed in battle.

In winter of that year, the northern warlord Cao Cao led an army of approximately 220,000 to conquer the south to complete the reunification of China. Two distinct factions emerged at his court on how to handle the situation. One, led by Zhang Zhao, urged surrender whilst the other, led by Zhou Yu and Lu Su, opposed capitulation. Eventually, Sun Quan decided to oppose Cao Cao in the middle Yangtze with his superior riverine forces. Allied with Liu Bei and employing the combined strategies of Zhou Yu and Huang Gai, they defeated Cao Cao decisively at the Battle of Red Cliffs.

In late 220, Cao Pi, King of Wei, Cao Cao&#x27;s son and successor, seized the throne and proclaimed himself to be the Emperor of China, ending and succeeding the nominal rule of the Han dynasty. At first Sun Quan nominally served as a Wei vassal with the Wei-created title of King of Wu, but after Cao Pi demanded that he send his son Sun Deng as a hostage to the Wei capital Luoyang and he refused. In November 222, he declared himself independent by changing his era name. It was not until May 229 that he formally declared himself emperor.

After the death of his original crown prince, Sun Deng, two opposing factions supporting different potential successors slowly emerged. When Sun He succeeded Sun Deng as the new crown prince, he was supported by Lu Xun and Zhuge Ke, while his rival Sun Ba was supported by Quan Cong and Bu Zhi and their clans. Over a prolonged internal power struggle, numerous officials were executed, and Sun Quan harshly settled the conflict between the two factions by exiling Sun He and forcing Sun Ba to commit suicide. Sun Quan died in May 252 at the age of 70 (by East Asian reckoning). He enjoyed the longest reign among all the founders of the Three Kingdoms and was succeeded by his son, Sun Liang.

The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; describes Sun Quan as a tall man with bright eyes and oblong face. He was known as a wise and outgoing man who was fond of making jokes and playing tricks. Because of his skill in valuing the strength of his subordinates and avoiding their shortcomings, as well as treating them like his family, Sun Quan was able to delegate authority to capable figures. This primary strength served him well in gaining the support of the common people and surrounding himself with capable generals.
==Early life and career==
The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; mentioned that Sun Jian was a descendant of Sun Wu (better known as Sun Tzu), a militarist in the Spring and Autumn period and the author of &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Sun Quan was born in 182, while his father Sun Jian was still a low-ranking official of the Han dynasty. He was the second son of Sun Jian and his wife Lady Wu; he had two younger full brothers, Sun Yi and Sun Kuang, and a younger full sister, whose identity is unrecorded.

In 184, two years after Sun Quan was born, the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jue broke out across the country. Sun Jian joined the general Zhu Jun to quell the rebellion and allocated his family to stay in Shouchun. When Sun Quan&#x27;s elder brother Sun Ce met Zhou Yu in 189, Sun Ce decided to take his mother Lady Wu and younger brothers to Shu County, Zhou Yu&#x27;s hometown. There, the Sun family became acquainted with Zhou Yu.

After Sun Jian&#x27;s death in 191, the Sun family moved again to Jiangdu in order to mourn him. Two years later, Sun Ce decided to join Yuan Shu&#x27;s army so he ordered Lü Fan to take his family members to his maternal uncle Wu Jing&#x27;s home in Danyang. However, Liu Yao, the Governor () of Yang Province became angry when Sun Ce and Yuan Shu defeated Lu Kang, the administrator of Lujiang in 194. He felt worried that they would attack him further so he drove Wu Jing away from Danyang. Since Sun Quan and his mother were still in Liu Yao&#x27;s territory, Zhu Zhi sent people to rescue them. Sun Quan and his mother moved to Fuling later.

When Sun Ce defeated Liu Yao in 195, he ordered Chen Bao to bring his family back to Danyang. As Sun Quan grew up, he served his brother during the conquests of the region south of the Yangtze River. He was made Yangxian County magistrate in 196, at the age of 14, and continued to rise through the ranks as his brother gave him more and more important tasks. Since he was passionate about gathering the retainers like Pan Zhang and Zhou Tai, his fame soon approached his father and elder brother. Zhu Ran and Hu Zong, the men he met during his schooldays, later became ministers of Eastern Wu. He was loved by his brother Sun Ce, who said that he would put his men under Sun Quan&#x27;s management in the future. In 199, Sun Quan was promoted to the rank of Colonel () and followed his brother to conquer Lujiang and Yuzhang. While Cao Cao attempted to further reinforce the alliance with Sun Ce, both Sun Quan and his younger brother Sun Yi were invited to be officials in Xuchang, but they refused.

==Succeeding Sun Ce==
Sun Ce was assassinated in 200 during a hunt. On his deathbed, he knew that his son was still too young to be considered a realistic heir, so he entrusted the 18-year-old Sun Quan to his faithful subordinates. Initially, Sun Quan mourned his brother&#x27;s death so much that he couldn&#x27;t stop crying, but at Zhang Zhao&#x27;s behest, he dressed himself in military uniform and set out to visit the commanderies under his brother&#x27;s control. Many of Sun Ce&#x27;s subordinates thought that Sun Quan was too young to sustain Sun Ce&#x27;s domain and wanted to leave. Particularly, Li Shu, the Administrator of Lujiang, defected to Cao Cao. Sun Quan wrote a letter to Cao Cao to state Li Shu&#x27;s crime then headed his troops to defeat Li Shu and regain Lujiang.

Zhang Zhao and Zhou Yu saw special qualities in the young man and chose to stay to serve Sun Quan. Zhang Hong, whom Sun Ce had earlier sent as a liaison to the warlord Cao Cao, also returned from Cao&#x27;s domain to assist Sun Quan. At Zhang Hong&#x27;s request, Cao Cao, in the name of Emperor Xian who was controlled by Cao Cao at the time, commissioned Sun Quan as &quot;General Who Attacks Barbarians&quot; (), a title under which he would be known for a long time. He listened carefully to his mother Lady Wu&#x27;s encouraging words, and greatly trusted Zhang Zhao and Zhang Hong with regard to civilian affairs and Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, and Lü Fan with regard to military matters. Sun Quan also sought out talented young men to serve as his personal advisors, and it was around this time that he befriended Lu Su and Zhuge Jin, who would later play prominent roles in his administration. In addition, Lu Xun, Bu Zhi, Gu Yong, Shi Yi, Yan Jun, Xu Sheng and Zhu Huan also became his men. Throughout this period and decades to come, Sun Quan&#x27;s leadership would be characterised by his ability to find men of character and entrust important matters to him, and his ability to react swiftly to events.

For the next several years, Sun Quan was largely interested in expanding against the Shanyue, hill tribes which controlled the most southern part of China and outside the reach of the Han government, in order to ensure his realm. Sun Quan launched numerous campaigns against the Shanyue. In 206, he conquered the fortress of Shanyue in Matun and Baodun and captured more than 10,000 men. Furthermore, he gradually sought to harass and weaken Liu Biao&#x27;s key subordinate, Huang Zu (who controlled the northeastern region of Liu Biao&#x27;s domain) – particularly because Huang Zu had killed his father in battle. He made war on Huang Zu twice in 203 and 207. In 208, he was finally able to defeat and kill Huang Zu in battle, and as a result, he obtained most of the territory of Jiangxia. Soon after, Liu Biao died while Cao Cao was preparing a major campaign to subjugate both Liu Biao and Sun Quan under his control, precipitating a major confrontation.

==Battle of Red Cliffs==

At the end of 208. After Liu Biao&#x27;s death, a succession struggle for his domain came into being, between his sons Liu Qi and younger son Liu Cong, whom Liu Biao&#x27;s second wife Lady Cai favoured (because he had married her niece). After Huang Zu&#x27;s death, Liu Qi was therefore given Huang&#x27;s post as the governor of Jiangxia Commandery. Liu Cong therefore succeeded Liu Biao after his death, and Liu Qi was displeased and considered, but did not carry out, an attack against his brother. Nevertheless, Liu Cong, in fear of having to fight Cao Cao and his brother on two fronts, surrendered to Cao Cao against the advice of Liu Biao&#x27;s key ally Liu Bei. Liu Bei, unwilling to submit to Cao Cao, fled south. Cao caught up to him and crushed his forces, but Liu Bei escaped with his life; he fled to Dangyang. Cao Cao took over most of Jing Province, and appeared set on finally unifying the empire.

Sun Quan was well aware of Cao Cao&#x27;s intentions, and he quickly entered into an alliance with Liu Bei and Liu Qi to prepare for an attack by Cao. Cao Cao wrote Sun Quan with a letter intending to intimidate, and in face of Cao&#x27;s overwhelming force (estimated to be about 220,000 men, although Cao claimed 800,000, against Sun&#x27;s 30,000 and the Lius&#x27; combined force of 10,000), many of Sun&#x27;s subordinates, including Zhang Zhao, advocated surrender. Sun Quan refused, under advice from Zhou Yu and Lu Su that Cao Cao would surely not tolerate him even if he surrendered.

Sun Quan put Zhou Yu in charge of his 30,000 men, largely stationed on naval ships, and Zhou set up a defensive position in conjunction with Liu Bei, whose army was stationed on land. About this time, there was a plague developing in Cao Cao&#x27;s forces which significantly weakened it. Zhou Yu set up a trap where he pretended to be punishing his subordinate Huang Gai, and Huang pretended to surrender to Cao Cao in fear. Zhou Yu then sent ships under Huang Gai&#x27;s command to pretend to surrender and, as Huang&#x27;s ships approached Cao Cao&#x27;s fleet, they were set aflame to assault Cao&#x27;s fleet, and Cao&#x27;s fleet was largely destroyed by fire. Cao Cao led his forces to escape on land, but much of the force was destroyed by Sun Quan and Liu Bei&#x27;s land forces.

==Uneasy alliance with Liu Bei==


Immediately after Cao Cao withdrew, Sun Quan took over the northern half of Jing Province. Liu Bei marched south and took over the southern half. The Sun-Liu alliance was further cemented by a marriage of Sun Quan&#x27;s younger sister, Lady Sun, to Liu Bei. Zhou Yu was suspicious of Liu Bei&#x27;s intentions, however, and suggested to Sun Quan that Liu be seized and put under house arrest (albeit be very well-treated) and his forces be merged into Sun&#x27;s; Sun Quan, believing that Liu Bei&#x27;s forces would rebel if he did that, declined. Sun Quan did agree to Zhou Yu&#x27;s plans to consider attacking Liu Zhang and Zhang Lu (who controlled the modern southern Shaanxi) to try to take over their territories, but after Zhou Yu died in 210, the plans were abandoned. However, Sun Quan was able to persuade the warlords in Jiao Province to submit to him, and they became part of his domain. He then yielded parts of northern Jing Province to Liu Bei as well, agreeing with Liu that the south was insufficient to supply his troops. At the same time, Sun Quan appointed his subordinate Bu Zhi as the Inspector () of Jiao Province to replace Lai Gong. Shi Xie led his followers to submit to Bu Zhi&#x27;s governorship. Sun Quan took over the entire Jiao Province.

In 211, Sun Quan moves his headquarters from Dantu to the city of Moling, and in the next year he rebuilt the walls and renamed the city Jianye. This new location gave him better control of the Yangtze River and better communications with his various other commanders. He also constructed fortresses at Ruxu, since Lü Meng anticipated an invasion there from Cao Cao.

The invasion Lü Meng expected came at the start of 213. Sun Quan personally led the army there to resist Cao Cao and relied heavily on the fortresses Lü Meng built to give his soldiers strong positions from which to defend. At one point, Cao Cao tried to send his navy across the river to break Sun Quan&#x27;s lines, but Sun Quan&#x27;s own ships surrounded them and destroyed them. Due to the stalemate in the war, Sun Quan drove a big ship to enter the military camp of Cao Cao on the other side of Yangtze River to observe his enemy situation. Cao Cao was very impressed with the military discipline of his opponent so he said that he should have a child like Sun Quan and didn&#x27;t launch an attack on this occasion. Sun Quan ordered people to play music on the ship and returned to his camp safely. Ultimately, Lü Meng&#x27;s defences held and Sun Quan wrote a letter to Cao Cao to warn that the spring rains would come a month later, Cao Cao had to take his advice and pull back.

After Cao Cao&#x27;s defeat at Ruxu, many people along the Yangtze River fled south to join Sun Quan. With the exception of Wan County and the immediate area, the region became abandoned. In 214, Cao Cao sent a man named Zhu Guang to Wan County with orders to revitalise the region and bring it under Cao Cao&#x27;s control. Zhu Guang began extensive agricultural projects, and he also stirred up bandits and malcontents into rebellion in Sun Quan&#x27;s territory. Lü Meng feared that if Zhu Guang&#x27;s programmes were successful, it would make Cao Cao&#x27;s hold in the area unbreakable and urged for a campaign against Huan. Sun Quan followed Lü Meng&#x27;s strategy and used the seasonal flooding to travel to the city by boat, which allowed them to attack unexpectedly. Rather than a lengthy siege, Lü Meng, Gan Ning and Ling Tong led a quick strike and broke Zhu Guang&#x27;s defences, capturing the city.

After Liu Bei&#x27;s conquest of Yi Province, he was able to supply his troops on his own, so Sun Quan sent Lu Su as an emissary to demand for the return of Jing Province, but Liu Bei refused. Sun Quan then sent Lü Meng and Ling Tong to lead 20,000 men to attack southern Jing Province and they succeeded in capturing Changsha, Guiyang, and Lingling commanderies. Meantime, Lu Su and Gan Ning advanced to Yiyang () with 10,000 men (to block Guan Yu) and took over command of the army at Lukou (). Liu Bei personally went to Gong&#x27;an County and Guan Yu led 30,000 men to Yiyang. When an all-out war was about to break out, the news that Cao Cao planned to attack Hanzhong was received by Liu Bei, and he requested for a border treaty with Sun Quan as he became worried about Cao Cao seizing Hanzhong. Liu Bei asked Sun Quan to give him back Lingling Commandery and create a diversion for Cao Cao by attacking Hefei; in return, Liu Bei ceded Changsha and Guiyang commanderies to Sun Quan, setting the new border along the Xiang River. Sun Quan&#x27;s attack on Hefei was disastrous - he was nearly captured on one occasion, if not saved by Ling Tong.

In 217, Cao Cao brought a massive army to attack Ruxu again. Sun Quan personally led 70,000 men to defend the city, though he left actual command of the battle to Lü Meng. It was a furious campaign, and after several weeks of gruelling battle, Lü Meng&#x27;s defences held and the spring floods forced Cao Cao to retreat once again.

Still, this was not a complete victory. Most of Cao Cao&#x27;s army was still intact and he had a huge force under Xiahou Dun north of Sun Quan&#x27;s position. This resulted in a stalemate in which as long as Sun Quan kept his army in Ruxu, Xiahou Dun could not hope to invade him; but as soon as Sun Quan pulled out of Ruxu, Xiahou Dun could break through. Also, Xiahou Dun&#x27;s force was simply too large and too well-entrenched to be driven away. Sun Quan had no military options, so he settled on a diplomatic solution. In 217, Sun Quan allied with Cao Cao, recognising him as the legitimate representative of the Han central government. While officially this was a surrender, Cao Cao knew that Sun Quan would not be content with being treated like a subject, so he confirmed all of the titles Sun Quan had claimed for himself and formalised his control over the lands he held. Sun Quan was permitted to continue to rule independently but was now officially one of Cao Cao&#x27;s subordinates.

==Breaking of alliance with Liu Bei==
In 219, Guan Yu advanced north, attacking Fancheng, scoring a major victory over Cao Ren. While Fancheng did not fall at this time, Guan Yu put it under siege, and the situation was severe enough that Cao Cao considered moving the capital away from Xu. However, Sun Quan, resentful of Guan Yu&#x27;s prior constant instigation of hostilities (including seizing Sun&#x27;s food supplies to use for his campaign north), took the opportunity to attack Guan from the rear, and Guan&#x27;s forces collapsed. Guan Yu was captured by forces under Lü Meng and Jiang Qin; Guan Yu was executed, Jing Province came under Sun&#x27;s control, and the Sun-Liu alliance ended.

After Cao Cao&#x27;s death in 220, Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to yield the throne to him, ending the Han dynasty and establishing the state of Cao Wei. Sun Quan did not immediately submit to Wei or declare independence after Cao Pi&#x27;s enthronement, but took a wait-and-see attitude; by contrast, in early 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor, establishing the state of Shu Han. Immediately, Liu Bei planned a campaign against Sun Quan to avenge Guan Yu. After attempting to negotiate peace and receiving no positive response from Liu Bei, fearing attack on both sides, Sun Quan became a vassal of Wei. Cao Pi&#x27;s strategist Liu Ye suggested that Cao Pi decline—and in fact attack Sun Quan on a second front, effectively partitioning Sun&#x27;s domain with Shu, and then eventually seek to destroy Shu as well. Cao Pi declined, in a fateful choice that most historians believe doomed his empire to ruling only the northern and central China—and this chance would not come again. Indeed, against Liu Ye&#x27;s advice, on 23 September 221 he appointed Sun Quan the King of Wu and granted him the nine bestowments.

In 222, at the Battle of Xiaoting, Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lu Xun dealt Liu Bei a major defeat, stopping the Shu offensive. Shu would not again pose a threat to Sun Quan from that point on. Later that year, when Cao Pi demanded that Sun Quan send his crown prince Sun Deng to the Wei capital Luoyang as a hostage (to guarantee his loyalty), Sun Quan refused and declared independence (by changing era name), thus establishing Eastern Wu as an independent state. Cao Pi launched a major attack on Wu, but after Wei defeats in early 223, it became clear that Wu was secure. After Liu Bei&#x27;s death later that year, Zhuge Jin&#x27;s brother Zhuge Liang, the regent for Liu Bei&#x27;s son and successor Liu Shan, reestablished the alliance with Sun Quan, and the two states would remain allies until Shu&#x27;s eventual destruction in 263.

==Early reign==

Early in Sun Quan&#x27;s reign, the Wu administration was known for its efficiency, as Sun showed a knack for listening to correct advice and for delegating authorities to the proper individuals. For example, he correctly trusted the faithful Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin, so much so that he made a duplicate imperial seal and left it with Lu Xun; whenever he would correspond with Shu&#x27;s emperor Liu Shan or regent Zhuge Liang, he would deliver the letter to Lu Xun first (as Lu&#x27;s post was near the Shu border), and then if, in Lu&#x27;s opinion, changes were needed, he would revise the letter and then restamp it with Sun&#x27;s imperial seal. Further, Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin were authorised to coordinate their actions with Shu without prior imperial approval. Sun Quan treated his high-level officials as friends and addressed them accordingly (with courtesy names), and in accordance they dedicated all effort to Wu&#x27;s preservation. He also knew what were the proper roles for officials that he trusted; for example, in 225, when selecting a chancellor, while the key officials all respected Zhang Zhao greatly and wanted him to be chancellor, Sun Quan declined, reasoning that while he respected Zhang greatly, a chancellor needed to handle all affairs of state, and Zhang, while capable, had such strong opinions that he would surely be in conflict with Sun Quan and other officials at all times. He also repeatedly promoted his official Lü Fan even though, while Sun Quan was young, Lü Fan had informed Sun Ce about his improper spending habits. Sun Quan understood that Lü did so only out of loyalty to Sun Ce.

In 224 and 225, Cao Pi again made attacks on Wu, but each time the Wu forces were able to repel Wei&#x27;s with fair ease—so easily that Cao Pi made the comment, &quot;Heaven created the Yangtze to divide the north and south.&quot; However, Sun Quan was himself equally unsuccessful in efforts to make major attacks on Wei. After Cao Pi&#x27;s death in 226, for example, Sun Quan launched an attack on Wei&#x27;s Jiangxia Commandery, but was forced to withdraw as soon as Wei reinforcements arrived. However, later that year, he was able to increase his effective control over Jiao Province when his general Lü Dai was able to defeat the warlord Shi Hui () and end the effective independence that the Shi clan had. In addition, the several independent kingdoms in modern Cambodia, Laos, and southern Vietnam all became Wu vassals as well.

The &quot;Book of Liang&quot; records the arrival in 226 of a merchant from the Roman Empire (Daqin) at Jiaozhi (Chinese-controlled northern Vietnam). The Prefect of Jiaozhou sent him to the court of Sun Quan in Nanjing. Sun Quan requested that he provide him with a report on his native country and its people. An expedition was mounted to return the merchant along with 10 female and 10 male &quot;blackish coloured dwarfs&quot; he had requested as a curiosity and a Chinese officer who, unfortunately, died en route.

The one major victory that Wu would have over Wei during this period came in 228, when, with Sun Quan&#x27;s approval, his general Zhou Fang pretended to be surrendering to Wei after pretending to have been punished repeatedly by Sun Quan. This tricked the Wei general Cao Xiu, who led a large army south to support Zhou Fang. He walked into the trap set by Zhou Fang and Lu Xun and suffered major losses, but was saved from total annihilation by Jia Kui.

In 229, Sun Quan declared himself emperor, which almost damaged the alliance with Shu, as many Shu officials saw this as a sign of betrayal of the Han dynasty—to which Shu claimed to be the legitimate successor. However, Zhuge Liang opposed ending the alliance and in fact confirmed it with a formal treaty later that year, in which the two states pledged to support each other and divide Wei equally if they could conquer it. Later that year, Sun Quan moved his capital from Wuchang to Jianye, leaving his crown prince Sun Deng, assisted by Lu Xun, in charge of the western parts of Eastern Wu.

==Middle reign==

In 230, however, the first sign of the deterioration of Sun Quan&#x27;s reign occurred. That year, he sent his generals Wei Wen () and Zhuge Zhi () with a navy of 10,000 into the East China Sea to seek the legendary islands of Yizhou () and Danzhou (), to seek to conquer them, despite strenuous opposition of Lu Xun and Quan Cong. The navy was not able to locate Danzhou but located Yizhou, and returned in 231 after capturing several thousand men—but only after 80–90% of the navy had died from illness. Instead of seeing his own fault in this venture, Sun Quan simply executed Wei Wen and Zhuge Zhi. Perhaps concerned about this deterioration in Sun Quan&#x27;s judgment, Sun Deng left the western empire in Lu Xun&#x27;s hands in 232 and returned to Jianye, and would remain at Jianye until his own death in 241.

In 232, Sun Quan had another misadventure involving his navy—as he sent his generals Zhou He () and Pei Qian () to the nominal Wei vassal Gongsun Yuan, in control of Liaodong Commandery, to purchase horses, against the advice of Yu Fan—and indeed, he exiled Yu Fan to the desolate Cangwu Commandery (roughly modern Wuzhou, Guangxi) as punishment. Just as Yu Fan predicted, however, the venture would end in failure—as Zhou He and Pei Qian, on their way back, were intercepted by Wei forces and killed. Regretting his actions, Sun Quan tried to recall Yu Fan back to Jianye, only to learn that Yu had died in exile.

The next year, however, Sun Quan would have yet another misadventure in his dealings with Gongsun Yuan, as Gongsun sent messengers to him, offering to be his subject. Sun Quan was ecstatic, and appointed Gongsun Yuan the Prince of Yan and granted him the nine bestowments, and further sent a detachment of 10,000 men by sea north to assist Gongsun Yuan in his campaign against Wei, against the advice of nearly every single one of his high-level officials, particularly Zhang Zhao. Once the army arrived, however, Gongsun Yuan betrayed them, killing Sun Quan&#x27;s officials Zhang Mi () and Xu Yan (), whom Sun had sent to grant the bestowments and seized their troops. Once that happened, the enraged Sun Quan wanted to personally head north with a fleet to attack Gongsun Yuan, and initially, not even Lu Xun&#x27;s opposition was able to stop him, although he eventually calmed down and did not follow through. To his credit, he also personally went to Zhang Zhao&#x27;s house and apologised to him. Further, despite the deterioration in his previous clear thinking, he was still capable of making proper decisions at times. For example, in 235, when, as a sign of contempt, Wei&#x27;s emperor Cao Rui offered horses to him in exchange for pearls, jade, and tortoise shells, Sun Quan ignored the implicit insult and made the exchange, reasoning that his empire needed horses much more than pearls, jade or tortoise shells.

In 234, in coordination with Zhuge Liang&#x27;s final northern expedition against Wei, Sun Quan personally led a major attack against Wei&#x27;s border city Hefei, while having Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin attack Xiangyang, with the strategy of trying to attract Wei relief forces and then attacking them. However, Wei generals correctly saw the situation and simply let Sun Quan siege Hefei. Only after Sun Quan&#x27;s food supplies ran low did Cao Rui personally arrive with reinforcements, and Sun withdrew, as did Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin.

In 238, when Gongsun Yuan was under attack by Wei&#x27;s general Sima Yi, Sun Quan, despite his prior rage against Gongsun, correctly judged the situation as one where he might be able to take advantage if Sima Yi were initially unsuccessful, so he did not immediately refuse Gongsun&#x27;s request for help. However, as Sima Yi was able to conquer Gongsun Yuan quickly, Sun Quan never launched the major attack that he considered if Sima got stuck in a stalemate with Gongsun. That year, he also recognised how Lü Yi, the supervisor of the audit bureau, had been abusing his powers, and had Lü Yi executed; he then further confirmed his trust in the high-level officials by personally writing an emotional letter to Zhuge Jin, Bu Zhi, Zhu Ran, and Lü Dai, blaming himself for the recent problems with his administration while urging them to speak out honestly whenever they saw faults in him.

In 241, Sun Quan would launch the last major assault against Wei of his reign, in light of Cao Rui&#x27;s death in 239, but he rejected a strategy offered by Yin Zha () to attack Wei in coordinated effort with Shu on four different fronts, and the campaign ended in failure as well.

==Late reign==
Later in 241, the crown prince Sun Deng died—an event that left open the issue of succession and appeared to mark the start of a precipitous decline in Sun Quan&#x27;s mental health. In 242, he appointed his son Sun He, born to Consort Wang, crown prince. However, he also favoured another son by Consort Wang, Sun Ba, and permitted Sun Ba to have the same staffing level as the crown prince—a move that a number of officials objected to as encouraging Sun Ba to compete with Sun He, but Sun Quan did not listen to them. After 245, when Sun He and Sun Ba began to have separate residences, their relationship deteriorated further, and Sun Ba began to scheme at how to seize heir status from Sun He. Fanned by gossip from his daughter Sun Luban, Sun Quan blamed Sun He&#x27;s mother Consort Wang for this—and she died in fear. He also cut off Sun He and Sun Ba&#x27;s access to the officials who supported them in hopes of receiving future favours, but this could not stop Sun Ba&#x27;s machinations. Indeed, when Lu Xun tried to intervene to protect Sun He, Sun Ba falsely accused him of many crimes, and Sun Quan became provoked so much that he repeatedly rebuked Lu Xun, causing him to die in frustration.

In 250, fed up with Sun Ba&#x27;s constant attacks against Sun He, Sun Quan carried out an inexplicable combination of actions. He forced Sun Ba to commit suicide, while deposing Sun He (who had not been shown to have committed any crimes), and instead creating his youngest son, Sun Liang, crown prince to replace Sun He. This move was opposed by his son-in-law Zhu Ju (the husband of Sun Quan&#x27;s daughter Sun Luyu), but Zhu Ju&#x27;s pleas not only did not help Sun He, but also resulted in his own death, as Sun Quan forced him to commit suicide. Many other officials who also opposed the move, as well as officials who had supported Sun Ba, were executed.

Around this time, Sun Quan also had his generals destroy a number of levees near the border with Wei, creating large areas of flooding, in order to obstruct potential attacks from Wei.

In 251, Sun Quan created the first empress of his reign—Sun Liang&#x27;s mother Consort Pan (previously, he had a succession of wives, but never made any of them empress, except for his favourite, Lady Bu, who was created empress posthumously after her death in 238). Later that year, however, he realised that Sun He was blameless and wanted to recall him from his exile, but was persuaded not to do so by his daughter Sun Luban and Sun Jun, who had supported Sun Liang&#x27;s ascension. He realised that he was getting very old (69 by this point) and, at Sun Jun&#x27;s recommendation, commissioned Zhuge Jin&#x27;s son Zhuge Ke as the future regent for Sun Liang, even though he correctly had misgivings about how Zhuge Ke was arrogant and had overly high opinions of his own abilities. At that time virtually the entire empire, awed by Zhuge&#x27;s prior military victories, was convinced that Zhuge would be the correct choice for regent.

In 252, as Sun Quan neared death, Empress Pan was murdered, but how she was murdered remains a controversy. Wu officials claimed that her servants, unable to stand her temper, strangled her while she was asleep, while a number of historians, including Hu Sanxing, the commentator to Sima Guang&#x27;s &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, believed that top Wu officials were complicit, as they feared that she would seize power as empress dowager after Sun Quan&#x27;s death. On 252, Sun Quan died at the age of 70 (by East Asian age reckoning), and Sun Liang succeeded him. Sun Quan was buried in August or September 252 in a mausoleum at the Purple Mountain in Jianye.

==Faith and spirituality==
Sun Quan initially believed in Taoism and communicated frequently with Taoist priests such as Ge Xuan, Yao Guang, and Jie Xiang. However, in 247, when Kang Senghui, a Buddhist monk from Jiaozhi (modern-day northern Vietnam), arrived in the state of Wu, Sun Quan had a conversation with him and ultimately chose to convert to Buddhism. With the support of Sun Quan, the Buddhist temple named &quot;Jianchusi&quot; () was established in the Jiangnan region.

<text>The Tenure of Office Act was a United States federal law, in force from 1867 to 1887, that was intended to restrict the power of the president to remove certain office-holders without the approval of the U.S. Senate. The law was enacted March 2, 1867, over the veto of President Andrew Johnson. It purported to deny the president the power to remove any executive officer who had been appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate, unless the Senate approved the removal during the next full session of Congress.

Johnson&#x27;s attempt to remove Secretary of War Edwin Stanton from office without the Senate&#x27;s approval led to the impeachment of Johnson in early 1868 for violating the act.

The act was significantly amended by Congress on April 5, 1869, under President Ulysses S. Grant. Congress repealed the act in its entirety in 1887, 20 years after the law was enacted. While evaluating the constitutionality of a similar law in &quot;Myers v. United States&quot; (1926), the Supreme Court stated that the Tenure of Office Act was likely invalid.

==Background==
The notion of the United States Senate advising and consenting the removal of Cabinet members to the same of the appointments were considered during the 1st United States Congress. The vote was tied with 9 in favor and 9 against on July 18, 1789. Vice President John Adams, with his first tie-breaking vote, voted against the bill, defeating it.

The Constitution adopted by the Confederate States of America was more explicit on the point, providing in Article II, Section 2, Clause 3 thereof, that &quot;The principal officer in each of the Executive Departments, and all persons connected with the diplomatic service, may be removed from office at the pleasure of the President. All other civil officers of the Executive Departments may be removed at any time by the President, or other appointing power, when their services are unnecessary, or for dishonesty, incapacity, inefficiency, misconduct, or neglect of duty; and when so removed, the removal shall be reported to the Senate, together with the reasons therefor.&quot;

In the post-Civil War political environment, President Johnson, a Democrat who had served as Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s second vice president, endorsed the quick re-admission of the Southern secessionist states. The two-thirds Republican majorities of both houses of Congress, however, passed laws over Johnson&#x27;s vetoes, establishing a series of five military districts overseeing newly created state governments. This &quot;Congressional Reconstruction&quot; was designed to create local civil rights laws to protect newly freed slaves; to protect and patrol the area; to ensure the secessionist states would show some good faith before being readmitted; to ensure Republican control of the states; and, arguably, to inflict some punishment on the secessionists. States would be readmitted gradually.

Overpowered politically, Johnson could apply the sole check to the Congressional Reconstruction plan of his control (as commander-in-chief) of the military, which would be the primary institution enforcing the plan&#x27;s provisions. Even Johnson&#x27;s control of the military was, however, inhibited by the fact that his Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, was a staunch Radical Republican who supported Congressional Reconstruction in full. This further set Johnson against the Republican-controlled Congress, with Johnson wanting to remove Stanton from office and Congress wanting to keep him in place.

==Stanton and impeachment of Johnson==
The Tenure of Office Act restricted the power of the president to suspend an officer while the Senate was not in session. At that time, Congress sat during a relatively small portion of the year. If, when the Senate reconvened, it declined to ratify the removal, the president would be required to reinstate the official.

In August 1867, with the Senate out of session, Johnson made his move against Stanton, suspending him pending the next session of the Senate. When the Senate convened on January 13, 1868, it refused, however, to ratify the removal by a vote of 35–6. Notwithstanding the vote, on February 22, 1868, President Johnson attempted to replace Stanton with Lorenzo Thomas because he wanted, by such action, to create a case through which to challenge the legitimacy of the Act before the Supreme Court. Proceedings began within days to move toward the impeachment of Johnson, the first impeachment of a United States President. After a three-month trial, Johnson narrowly avoided removal from office by the Senate by a single vote. Stanton resigned in May 1868.

It was unclear whether Johnson had violated the Tenure of Office Act which led up to the impeachment. The act&#x27;s phrasing was murky, and it was not clear whether his removal of Stanton (a holdover from the Lincoln administration whom Johnson had not appointed) violated the Act. While the Act, by its terms, applied to current office holders, it also limited the protection offered to Cabinet members to one month after a new president took office.

==Later use==
The act was amended on April 5, 1869, one month and one day after Republican president Ulysses S. Grant assumed the presidency. The revisions grew out of an attempt to completely repeal the 1867 Act. The measure to repeal passed the House of Representatives with only 16 negative votes but failed in the Senate. The new provisions were significantly less onerous, allowing the president to suspend office holders &quot;in his discretion&quot; and designate replacements while the Senate was in recess, subject only to confirmation of the replacements at the next session. The president no longer had to report his reasons for suspension to the Senate, and the Senate could no longer force reinstatement of suspended office holders. 

Although Grant, in his first message to Congress, in December 1869, urged the repeal of even the revised act, it did not cause further problems until the election of Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884. Under the spoils system it had long been accepted practice for the administration of a new party to replace current office holders with party faithful. Cleveland, a supporter of a civil service system, had promised, however, to avoid wholesale replacements, vowing to replace incumbents only for cause. When he suspended several hundred office holders for cause, Senate committees requested information from cabinet members regarding the reasons for the suspensions, which Cleveland refused to provide. If he had simply said that the incumbents were being replaced for political reasons, the Senate would have complied, but Cleveland would not do so. When, in early 1886, the Senate as a whole demanded information regarding the conduct of the suspended U.S. Attorney for southern Alabama, Cleveland sent a message to Congress explaining his position opposing impingement of independence of the executive. Cleveland&#x27;s replacement nominee was eventually confirmed when it was discovered that the suspended incumbent&#x27;s term had expired in the meantime anyway. The Tenure of Office Act was formally repealed in 1887.

==Constitutionality==
In 1926, a similar law (though not dealing with Cabinet secretaries) was ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Myers v. United States&quot;, which affirmed the ability of the president to remove a Postmaster without Congressional approval. In reaching that decision, the Supreme Court stated in its majority opinion (though in dicta), &quot;that the Tenure of Office Act of 1867, insofar as it attempted to prevent the president from removing executive officers who had been appointed by him by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, was invalid&quot;.

<text>The Amnesty Act of 1872 is a United States federal law passed on May 22, 1872, which removed most of the penalties imposed on former Confederates by the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted on July 9, 1868. Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the election or appointment to any federal or state office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion, or treason. However, the section provides that a two-thirds vote by each House of the Congress could override this limitation. The 1872 act was passed by the 42nd United States Congress and the original restrictive Act was passed by the United States Congress in May 1866.

Specifically, the 1872 Act removed office-holding disqualifications against most of the secessionists who rebelled in the American Civil War, except for &quot;Senators and Representatives of the thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh Congresses, officers in the judicial, military, and naval service of the United States, heads of departments, and foreign ministers of the United States.&quot;

In the spirit of the act, then United States President Ulysses S. Grant, by proclamation dated June 1, 1872, directed all district attorneys having charge of proceedings and prosecutions against those who had been disqualified by the Fourteenth Amendment to dismiss and discontinue them, except as to persons who fall within the exceptions named in the act. President Grant also pardoned all but 500 former top Confederate leaders.

The 1872 law cleared over 150,000 former Confederate troops who had taken part in the American Civil War.

== Text ==
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each house concurring therein), that all political disabilities imposed by the third section of the fourteenth article of amendments of the Constitution of the United States are hereby removed from all persons whomsoever, except Senators and Representatives of the thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh Congresses, officers in the judicial, military, and naval service of the United States, heads of departments, and foreign ministers of the United States.
== Legacy ==
The Amnesty Act of 1872 states that all political disabilities imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment &quot;are hereby removed,&quot; but does not explicitly mention whether future disabilities under the same amendment are also to be considered removed. In March 2022, in the aftermath of the January 6 US Capitol attack, the US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina ruled that the Act applies even to current members of Congress, automatically removing the political consequences of any alleged violation of Section 3. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit unanimously reversed that ruling. A different federal district court ruled that the Act does not apply to current members of Congress, and that Section 3 is still applicable. The plaintiff&#x27;s appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was dismissed as moot after it was determined that she had not violated Section 3.

<text>The Specie Payment Resumption Act of January 14, 1875 was a law in the United States that restored the nation to the gold standard through the redemption of previously unbacked United States Notes and reversed inflationary government policies promoted directly after the American Civil War. The decision further contracted the nation&#x27;s money supply and was seen by critics as an exacerbating factor of the so-called Long Depression, which struck in 1873.

==History==

Late in 1861, seeking to raise revenue for the American Civil War effort without exhausting its reserves of gold and silver, the United States federal government suspended specie payments, or the payments made in gold and silver in redemption of currency notes. Early in 1862, the United States issued legal-tender notes, called greenbacks. By war&#x27;s end, a total of million in greenbacks had been issued, and authorization had been given for another million in small denominations, known as fractional currency or &quot;shin plasters.&quot; The issuance of greenbacks caused inflation during the period.

Immediately after the Civil War during Reconstruction, there were large capital inflows into the United States and a general improvement in the export-to-import ratio since the export-dominant South was reintegrated with the North. The United States Treasury, however, had increased its cash balance through the summer of 1873 by selling gold for million. National banks also increased issuance of national bank notes by million. The failure of several railroad companies including Jay Cooke &amp; Company on their bond obligations encouraged capital outflows from the United States to Europe and weakened demand for dollars leading to the Panic of 1873. Increased Treasury cash balances, continued issuance of national bank notes, and capital outflows together depreciated the currency. These factors further caused a reduction in reserves held by monetary institutions because higher prices increased domestic demand for currency. Reserves held by banks were insufficient to be able to meet seasonal demands in autumn of 1873 as greenback reserves declined from million in September 1873 to million in October 1873. Tensions surrounding the Panic of 1873 between creditors and debtors revived the specie payment resumption debate.

Two views dominated this debate. Conservatives and the creditor class favored &quot;hard money&quot;, they favored resumption as a method for making up losses incurred due to dollar depreciation during the past decade. The resumption of specie payments was perceived as a method to curb the rise in the price level and eventually equate currency with gold. For creditors, that had issued debts in inflated greenbacks, resumption would increase the real interest rate that they received. Supporters of the Resumption Act argued that the Panic of 1873 might not have occurred had there been sufficient reserves of gold in the United States Treasury as would have been the case if specie payments were resumed.

Opposed to resumption, a new coalition of agrarian and labor interests found common cause during Reconstruction in advocating for &quot;soft money&quot; or the promotion of inflationary monetary policies. These groups viewed the Panic of 1873 as the result of insufficient currency that should have been used to fuel the growth in production that occurred in the South and the West. These regions relied on cheap money – that is low interest rates – to be able to continue to grow. Other soft money advocates included gold speculators and the railroad industry. Collis P. Huntington and other railroad leaders called for further greenback issuance in light of harsh business conditions that made honoring debt obligations difficult. Opponents of the Resumption Act also argued that many debt obligations were made in an environment in which there existed a premium on gold, that is that inflation in the currency in the previous decade made gold relatively more valuable than currency. Resumption therefore entailed up to a 50% increase in debt obligation if gold and currency equalized. For manufacturers, the rising price of gold made domestic prices cheaper relative to import prices since many European currencies including sterling were fixed to the price of gold. Hence continued inflationary measures such as further issuance of greenbacks artificially supported domestic industries. Hard and soft money interests often did cross party lines, although a larger portion of Democrats were hard money advocates.

Following a Democratic congressional victory in the elections of 1874, a lame-duck Republican congress passed The Resumption Act of January 14, 1875. It required the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem greenbacks in specie on demand on or after 1 January 1879. The Act, however, did not provide for a specific mechanism for redemption. The Act, though, did allow the Secretary of Treasury to acquire gold reserves either via any federal surpluses or the issuance of government bonds. An established gold reserve allowed for daily variations in specie flows and facilitated resumption. The act abolished the seigniorage fee on coining gold and substituted silver for any still existing fractional currency. The Resumption Act set no limit on the quantity of national bank notes that could be issued; this idea became known as &quot;free banking.&quot; This provision led many conservatives to believe that the Act was inflationary in nature. However, the Resumption Act also required that greenbacks be retired in a proportion of 80% of new national bank note issue, which in theory aimed to contract the money supply and hence encourage dollar appreciation such that gold and currency might equate. However, in practice the effect was mild: the total quantity of greenbacks in circulation fell from million at the end of 1874 to million following the passage of the Resumption Act.

The Resumption Act was hotly debated during the 1880 presidential election, with most western politicians opposed to it. Specie payments finally resumed during the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes. Aided by the return of prosperity in 1877, Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman accumulated a gold reserve to be redeemed for existing greenbacks mostly from transactions with Europe. Sherman earmarked a redemption fund by January 1, 1879, that amounted to million acquired from the sale of bonds to Europe and Treasury surplus. However, when people found greenbacks to be on par with gold, they lost their desire for redemption.

==Reaction and evaluation==
Reactions as to the effects of the Resumption Act are mixed. Contemporaries did not consider it an outright victory for hard money. The legislation stood as a compromise engineered by Senators John Sherman and George Edmunds between hard and soft money advocates. Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz argue that the Resumption Act had mixed effects on actual resumption of specie payments, saying that primary economic product of the Act was that it instilled confidence in the business community on the maintenance of specie payments. According to Jennifer 8 Lee, backing American currency with gold helped curb inflation and stabilize the dollar. The Act served as a signal to businesses of an approaching exchange rate between gold and currency. Preparations among businesses for this exchange rate actually encourage parity between gold and currency.

The Act did not directly address the price level although successful resumption at par value required that the premium on gold to fall to zero, which in turn required a fall in the price level as the world price of gold was exogenous. In fact, the final date for Resumption was decided only after the premium on gold had fallen to a tenth of its peak level. The decline in the premium cannot entirely be attributed to the Resumption Act, as downward pressure on the overall price level also resulted from increased production in the South especially during 1877. The first four months of that year sold as much beef to England as had been sold all of the preceding year. The act has also been criticized for both failing to remove all greenbacks from circulation and failing to dictate what might be done with the greenbacks remaining in circulation.

<doc id="55659" wikidata="Q635737" url="?curid=55659" title="Bland–Allison Act">
<text>The Bland–Allison Act, also referred to as the Grand Bland Plan of 1878, was an act of the United States Congress requiring the U.S. Treasury to buy a certain amount of silver and put it into circulation as silver dollars. Though the bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes, the Congress overrode Hayes&#x27;s veto on February 28, 1878, to enact the law. The text of the act can be found in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; under the further reading section of this article.

==Background==
The 5 1/2-year depression following the Panic of 1873 caused cheap-money advocates (led by Representative Richard P. Bland, a Democrat of Missouri), to join with silver-producing interests in urging a return to bimetallism, the use of both silver and gold as a standard. Coupled with Senator William B. Allison of Iowa, they agreed to a proposal that allowed silver to be purchased at market rates, metals to be minted into silver dollars, and required the US Treasury to purchase between $2 million to $4 million silver each month from western mines. President Rutherford B. Hayes, who held interests in industrials and banking, vetoed the measure, which was overturned by Congress. As a result, the Hayes administration purchased the limited amount of silver each month. This act helped restore bimetallism with gold and silver both supporting the currency. However, gold remained heavily favored over silver, paving way for the gold standard.

==Free-silver movement==

The free-silver movement of the late 19th century advocated the unlimited coinage of silver, which would have resulted in inflationary monetary policy. In 1873, Congress had removed the use of silver dollar from the list of authorized coins under the Coinage Act of 1873 (referred to by opponents as &#x27;the Crime of &#x27;73&#x27;&quot;). Although the Bland–Allison Act of 1878 directed the Treasury to purchase silver from the &quot;best-western&quot; miners, President Grover Cleveland repealed the act in 1893. Advocates of free silver included owners of silver mines in the West, farmers who believed an inclusion of silver would increase crop prices, and debtors who believed it would alleviate their debts. Although the free silver movement ended, the debate of inflation and monetary policy continues to this day.

==Coinage Act of 1873==
The Fourth Coinage Act acknowledged the gold standard over silver. Those who advocated for silver labeled this act as the &quot;Crime of &#x27;73&quot;. As a result of demonetized silver, gold became the only metallic standard in the United States and became the default standard. The price of gold was more stable than that of silver, largely due to silver discoveries in Nevada and other places in the West, and the ratio of the gold price to the silver price increased from 16-to-1 in 1873 to nearly 30-to-1 by 1893. The term limping bimetallism describes this problem. The U.S. government finally ceded to pressure from the western mining states and the Bland–Allison Act went into effect in 1878. The law was replaced in 1890 by the similar Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which in turn was repealed by Congress in 1893. These were two instances where the United States attempted to establish bimetallic standards in the long run.

==Reactions and economic impact==
Western miners and debtors regarded the Bland–Allison Act as an insufficient measure to enforce unlimited coinage of silver, but opponents repealed the act and advocated for the gold standard. The effect of the Bland–Allison act was also blunted by the minimal purchase of silver required by the Hayes administration. Although the act was a near turning point for bimetallism, gold continued to be favored over the bimetallism standard.

Throughout 1860 to 1871, several attempts were made by the Treasury to establish the bimetallic standard by having gold and silver dollar coins. However, the discovery of silver led to an influx of supply, lowering the price of silver. The eventual removal of the bimetallic standard, including the Bland–Allison Act and the acceptance of the gold standard formed the monetary stability in the late 19th century.

The limitation placed on the supply of new notes and the Treasury control over the issue of new notes allowed for economic stability. Prior to the acceptance, the devaluation of silver forced local governments into a financial turmoil. In addition, there was a need for money supply to increase as the credit system expanded and large banks established themselves across states.

In addition, the priority that was placed on the coinage of silver dollars left very little available silver for the coinage of silver coins of lesser denominations, particularly half dollars and quarters. As a result, these coins had extremely low mintages (fewer than 5,000 half dollars were struck in 1879, 1882, and 1884, and 5,000 quarters were struck in 1886) until the Barber coinage began in 1892.

<text>This is a list of [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish monarch]]s, that is, the kings and queen regnants of Denmark. This includes:

* The Kingdom of Denmark (up to 1397)
** Personal union of Denmark and Norway (1380–1397)
* The Kalmar Union (1397–1536)
** Union of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (1397–1523)
** Union of Denmark and Norway (1523–1536/1537)
* The United Kingdoms of Denmark–Norway (1536/1537–1814)
* The Kingdom of Denmark (1814–present)
** Iceland (since the union between Denmark and Norway in 1380; independent kingdom in a personal union with Denmark 1918–1944; a sovereign republic since 1944)
** Greenland (since the union between Denmark and Norway in 1380; effective Danish–Norwegian control began in 1721; integrated into the Danish realm in 1953; internal home rule introduced 1979; self-rule assumed in 2009; Greenland has two out of 179 seats in the Danish parliament Folketinget)
** Faroe Islands (since the union between Denmark and Norway in 1380; County of Denmark 1816–1948; internal home rule introduced 1948; The Faroe Islands have two out of 179 seats in the Danish parliament Folketinget)

The House of Oldenburg held the Danish Crown between 1448 and 1863, when it passed to the house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a cadet branch of the same house, patrilineally descended from King Christian III of Denmark. The kingdom had been elective (although the eldest son or brother of the previous king was usually elected) until 1660, when it became hereditary and absolutist. Until 1864 Denmark was also united in a personal union with the duchies of Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg (1815–1864), and in a political and personal union with the Duchy of Schleswig.

==Pre-Knýtlinga Danish monarchs==


The exact date of origin of the Kingdom of Denmark is not established, but names of Danish kings begins to emerge in foreign sources from the 8th century and onwards. Danish and Nordic legendary stories, chronicles and sagas often have accounts of Danish kings and dynasties stretching further back in time than the 7th century, but the historicity of the content and interpretations of these stories are often put to doubt.

*Chochilaicus—see Hugleik and Hygelac— 515 AD, mentioned by Gregory of Tours (538–594). Hugleik, according to the written sources, suffered a defeat in 515 during a naval expedition to the Frankish Empire. Hugleik is the first Danish king mentioned in European sources.
*Ongendus (&quot;Angantyr&quot;): Saint Willibrord wrote about when he visited the Danes, at the time ruled by Ongendus.
*Harald, named as former king in relating 9th-century events, perhaps model for legendary Harald Wartooth. Related to the Frisian king Redbad II who in 754 had to flee to &quot;the land of the Danes&quot; where King Harald reigned (&quot;Daniae Regi Heraldi&quot;).
*Sigfred: 770s–790s
*Gudfred: 804–810, mentioned as Danish king in the Treaty of Heiligen 811. Alternate spellings: Godfred, Göttrick (German), Godric(Anglicized English), Gøtrik (Danish), Gudrød (Danish)
*Hemming: 810–811/812 The Treaty of Heiligen was signed in 811 between the Danish King Hemming and Charlemagne.
*Sigfred, nephew of Gudfred, and Anulo (&quot;Anlaufr&quot;), grandson or nephew of Harald, fought for the throne and both were killed, perhaps model for the legendary Sigurd Hring: 
*Harald Klak and his brothers Ragnfrid and Hemming Halfdansson: 812–813 and again from 819/827. From 826 he and his household lived in exile with the Frankish emperor Louis the Pious, he was baptized by the bishop of Mainz in Ingelheim am Rhein. The last reference of Harald in the written sources are in the Annals of Fulda which records his execution for treason in 852.
*Sons of Gudfred (Godrik): 814–820s
**Horik I: (814) 827–854, King of the Danes (at first ruling jointly with his unnamed brothers). The Frankish annals mention Horik on numerous occasions during the next couple of decades.
*Horik II: 854–860s. He is believed to have been the immediate successor of Horik I, but the annals are silent about the name of the Danish king for a few years after the disaster of 854. In 857, Horik II allowed Rorik to occupy the part of the kingdom between the sea and the Eider. Horik II was still alive in 864, when a letter was addressed to him by Pope Nicholas I.
*Late 9th century kings
**Bagsecg: 
**Halfdan: 871–877
**Sigfred: . It is generally assumed that he was the immediate successor of Horik II, although that is not certain. His year of succession is unknown, but it was between 864 (when Horik II was still king) and his first appearance as king in the Frankish annals in 873. Sigifrid was baptized in 882.
**Gudfred: 880s
**Heiligo (&quot;Halga&quot;): 890s (?), described by Adam of Bremen as the immediate predecessor of the House of Olof.
*The &quot;House of Olaf&quot;: late 9th century and early 10th century. This dynasty is described by Adam of Bremen, and members of this claimed dynasty are commemorated by the two Sigtrygg Runestones, which represent contemporary evidence that some of these kings controlled at least part of Denmark.
**Olof, said by Adam to have come from Sweden and defeated Heiligo, taking the crown.
**Gyrd and Gnupa, sons and joint successors of Olof, according to Adam. Gnupa is named by Widukind of Corvey as leader of the Danes in 934, and appears on the Sigtrygg Runestones.
**Sigtrygg, son of Gnupa, memorialized on the Sigtrygg Runestones, presumably dating from shortly after 934.
* Eric the Victorious of Sweden mentioned by Adam of Bremen and Saxo Grammaticus as ruling Denmark after an invasion by Sweden together with Slavic warriors. Adam of Bremen got the information from Danish king Sweyn II. The Stone of Eric also describes an attack on Hedeby from the same period. Since Eric also, according to another source of Adam of Bremen, invaded the Holy Roman Empire. It virtually requires Eric to have been the king of Denmark. Therefore two independent sources describe Eric as the king of Denmark. 

===Semi-legendary kings===
* Ragnar Lodbrok, a legendary king probably in the 9th century, only appears in sagas and late histories, and these accounts are wildly inconsistent. He may be a composite character, a chimera of several historical kings and Vikings.
* Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye (da: Sigurd Orm-i-øje or Snogeøje). Mentioned by late and Ragnarssona þáttr. Said to be king of Zealand and Scania, and son of Ragnar Lodbrok. He may be inspired by late 9th century King Sigfred (above).
* Harthacnut (&quot;Hardeknud&quot;). According to the sagas he is son of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, but some historians identify him with Adam&#x27;s Hardegon, Svein&#x27;s son, who invaded Denmark from &quot;Northmannia&quot; and supplanted the House of Olof. He may have ruled only part of Denmark, as Adam places the commencement of his long reign between 909 and 915, while the House of Olof was still ruling at least part of Denmark as late as 934. He was father of Gorm the Old.

<text>Johannes Gerardus Hendrikus &quot;Hans&quot; Janmaat (3 November 1934 – 9 June 2002) was a Dutch businessman and politician of the Centre Party (CP) who later founded the Centre Democrats (CD).

Although he was widely known, he was never a major force in the Dutch political landscape, partly because of a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; imposed by Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers&#x27;s third cabinet.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Johannes Gerardus Hendrikus Janmaat was born on 3 November 1934 in Nes aan de Amstel in North Holland, as the oldest of nine children in a traditional Roman Catholic family. His father was a salesman and insurance broker. When Janmaat was 4 years old, the family moved to Gouda, where it would endure the war years in relative peace.
After graduating in 1954, Janmaat started a study in aeronautical engineering, but had to drop out two years later after his father could no longer afford the tuition fees. Having to give up his studies to work was the first of many setbacks he would often refer to later in life.

In 1966 he married Belgian Evi Hock, having met her while working in Germany. In 1979, they divorced. In 1996, Janmaat married Wil Schuurman. No children were born in either marriage.

In the early 1960s, Janmaat ran a furniture factory with two of his brothers, but it burned down in 1966. He used the insurance payout to study politicology at the University of Amsterdam. Fellow-students found him ambitious, provocative and witty. In 1969, he participated in the occupation of the &quot;Maagdenhuis&quot;, the university&#x27;s administrative center, as part of a student protest. He completed his studies in 1972.

===Politics===
After graduating, Janmaat held part-time positions as a teacher of civics. He also ran a one-man consultancy for small businesses.

In 1972, he joined the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP). He also worked in several commissions for the Democratic Socialists &#x27;70 (DS&#x27;70) party. Despite his efforts, he was not considered suitable for a front line position because of his capriciousness and tendency to go against the grain.

In the 1970s, he became more interested in the emerging issue of immigration as large numbers of foreign workers came to the Netherlands. His increasingly radical stance lead to a break with the KVP as well as DS&#x27;70.


In 1980, he read an article in Vrij Nederland which drew his attention to the recently founded extreme-right Centre Party (CP). After several interviews, he joined the party as its seventh member. Starting as a publicity worker, he would rapidly rise to be the party&#x27;s top and was its &quot;lijsttrekker&quot; (top candidate) for the 1982 elections. The party won a single seat in the House of Representatives, which went to Janmaat. Other political parties largely ignored and ostracized him.

===Centre Democrats===
After disagreements and a power struggle with other members of the Centrum Party, he was expelled from the CP in October 1984. However, he retained his seat in parliament, in accordance with Dutch law. Janmaat officially launched his own party, the Centre Democrats (CD) in November 1984. Politically, the party did not differ greatly from the CP, except that it was strongly centered around Janmaat, to prevent another power struggle.

Several attempts were made to reconcile the differences between CP and CD. One such meeting in a hotel in Kedichem was disrupted by left-wing activists, who set fire to the building. Janmaat narrowly escaped with his life, CD secretary (and later wife of Janmaat) Wil Schuurman lost a leg because of injuries sustained jumping out of a window to escape the fire.

In the 1986 election, Janmaat lost his seat in parliament, however he regained his single seat in 1989.

His biggest political success would be in the 1994 elections, when he gained three seats. Major political parties changed their response to Janmaat and his views: rather than actively ignoring him they also started openly addressing the issue of immigration. In the 1998 election the CD lost all three of its seats. Janmaat had become increasingly paranoid and said that computers used for voting had been tampered with.

In 1999, Janmaat was in the process of starting another party, the &quot;Conservative Democrats&quot;, however it did not get off the ground and did not participate in the 2002 election.

His failing health forced him to withdraw from politics, however the changing political climate did prompt him to challenge his conviction for discrimination at the European Court of Justice. Janmaat&#x27;s death in 2002 halted the case.

===Political views===
Janmaat wanted to represent the indigenous Dutch workers and middle class. His views were based mostly on economic and materialistic arguments rather than an underlying ideology. Disappointing economic growth, unemployment and government cutbacks could not be addressed while large numbers of immigrants were flowing into the country. Janmaat was against a multicultural society: he argued that immigrants should either assimilate into Dutch culture, or return to their country of birth.
His best known slogans were &quot;Holland is not a country of immigration,&quot; &quot;full=full&quot; and &quot;we will abolish the multicultural society, as soon as we get the chance and power&quot;; he was convicted for the last two statements. According to Jan van de Beek, Hans Janmaat often used economic arguments in his tirades against immigrants.

He was often accused of committing acts of hate speech, and received fines and a conditional felony prison sentence for incitement to hatred and discrimination against foreigners.

He often made controversial remarks about immigrants and other politicians. He argued that Ernst Hirsch Ballin should not be allowed to hold a high office because of his Jewish heritage and said he was not saddened by the sudden death of political opponent Ien Dales.

===Legacy===
Other parties erected a cordon sanitaire around Janmaat, ignoring him while he spoke in parliament. A taboo on discussing negative aspects of immigration existed in the Dutch political climate in the 1980s.

Meindert Fennema, Emeritus Professor of Political Theory of Ethnic Relations at the University of Amsterdam, argued in 2006 that Janmaat was convicted for statements that are now commonplace due to changes in the political climate (caused in part by the September 11 attacks, and the assassinations of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh).

As the first public spokesperson who tried to put the topic of immigration on the Dutch political agenda, Janmaat has been mentioned as a forerunner of Pim Fortuyn, Geert Wilders and Thierry Baudet and their parties Leefbaar Nederland, Partij voor de Vrijheid and Forum voor Democratie, which booked greater electoral successes in the following decades.

<doc id="55663" wikidata="Q7162467" url="?curid=55663" title="Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act">
<text>The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act is a United States federal law passed by the 47th United States Congress and signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur on January 16, 1883. The act mandates that most positions within the federal government should be awarded on the basis of merit instead of political patronage.

By the late 1820s, American politics operated on the spoils system, a political patronage practice in which officeholders awarded their allies with government jobs in return for financial and political support. Proponents of the spoils system were successful at blocking meaningful civil service reform until the assassination of President James A. Garfield in 1881. The 47th Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act during its lame duck session and President Chester A. Arthur, himself a former spoilsman, signed the bill into law.
The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act provided for the selection of some government employees by competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote these government officials for political reasons and created the United States Civil Service Commission to enforce the merit system. The act initially only applied to about ten percent of federal employees, but it now covers most federal employees. As a result of the court case &quot;Luévano v. Campbell&quot;, most federal government employees are no longer hired by means of competitive examinations.

== Background ==
Since the presidency of Andrew Jackson, presidents had increasingly made political appointments on the basis of political support rather than on the basis of merit, in a practice known as the spoils system. In return for appointments, these appointees were charged with raising campaign funds and bolstering the popularity of the president and the party in their communities. The success of the spoils system helped ensure the dominance of both the Democratic Party in the period before the American Civil War and the Republican Party in the period after the Civil War. Patronage became a key issue in elections, as many partisans in both major parties were more concerned about control over political appointments than they were about policy issues.

During the Civil War, Senator Charles Sumner introduced the first major civil service reform bill, calling for the use of competitive exams to determine political appointments. Sumner&#x27;s bill failed to pass Congress, and in subsequent years several other civil service reform bills were defeated even as the public became increasingly concerned about public corruption. After taking office in 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes established a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments. Hayes&#x27;s efforts for reform brought him into conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party, led by Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. With Congress unwilling to take action on civil service reform, Hayes issued an executive order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics.

According to historian Eric Foner, the advocacy of civil service reform was recognized by blacks as an effort that would stifle their economic mobility and prevent &quot;the whole colored population&quot; from holding public office.

Chester Arthur, Collector of the Port of New York, and his partisan subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, obstinately refused to obey the president&#x27;s order. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men&#x27;s resignations, which they refused to give. Hayes was obliged to wait until July 1878 when, during a Congressional recess, he sacked Arthur and Cornell and replaced them with recess appointments. Despite opposition from Conkling, both of Hayes&#x27;s nominees were confirmed by the Senate, giving Hayes his most significant civil service reform victory. For the remainder of his term, Hayes pressed Congress to enact permanent reform legislation and restore the dormant United States Civil Service Commission, even using his last annual message to Congress in 1880 to appeal for reform.

==Provisions==
The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act provided for selection of some government employees by competitive exams rather than ties to politicians, and made it illegal to fire or demote some government officials for political reasons. The act initially applied only to ten percent of federal jobs, but it allowed the president to expand the number of federal employees covered by the act. Within five years of the passage of the law, half of federal appointments outside of the United States Postal Service were covered by the act.

The law also created the United States Civil Service Commission to oversee civil service examinations and outlawed the use of &quot;assessments,&quot; fees that political appointees were expected to pay to their respective political parties as the price for their appointments. These assessments had made up a majority of political contributions in the era following Reconstruction.

==Legislative history==
In 1880, Democratic Senator George H. Pendleton of Ohio introduced legislation to require the selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination, but the measure failed to pass. Pendleton&#x27;s bill was largely based on reforms proposed by the Jay Commission, which Hayes had assigned to investigate the Port of New York. It also expanded similar civil service reforms attempted by President Franklin Pierce 30 years earlier.

Hayes did not seek a second term as president, and was succeeded by fellow Republican James A. Garfield, who won the 1880 presidential election on a ticket with former Port Collector Chester A. Arthur. In 1881, President Garfield was assassinated by Charles Guiteau, who believed that he had not received an appointment by Garfield because of his own affiliation with the Stalwarts. Garfield died on September 19, 1881, and was succeeded by Vice President Arthur. Many worried about how Arthur would act as president; the &quot;New York Times&quot;, which had supported Arthur earlier in his career, wrote &quot;Arthur is about the last man who would be considered eligible for the position.&quot;

Garfield&#x27;s assassination by a deranged office seeker amplified the public demand for reform. Civil service reformers established the National Civil Service Reform League and undertook a major public campaign for reform, arguing that the spoils system had played a major role in the assassination of Garfield. In President Arthur&#x27;s first annual address to Congress, Arthur requested civil service reform legislation, and Pendleton again introduced his bill, which again did not pass. Democrats, campaigning on the reform issue, won control of the House of Representatives in the 1882 congressional elections.

The party&#x27;s disastrous performance in the 1882 elections helped convince many Republicans to support the civil service reform during the 1882 lame-duck session of Congress. The election results were seen as a public mandate for civil service reform, but many Republicans also wanted to pass a bill so that they could craft the legislation before losing control of Congress, allowing the party to take credit for the bill and to protect Republican officeholders from dismissal. The Senate approved Pendleton&#x27;s bill, 38–5, and the House soon concurred by a vote of 155–47. Nearly all congressional opposition to the Pendleton bill came from Democrats, though a majority of Democrats in each chamber of Congress voted for the bill. A mere seven U.S. representatives constituted the Republican opposition towards the Pendleton Act: Benjamin F. Marsh, James S. Robinson, Robert Smalls, William Robert Moore, John R. Thomas, George W. Steele, and Orlando Hubbs. Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January 16, 1883.

==Aftermath==
To the surprise of his critics, Arthur acted quickly to appoint the members of the newly created Civil Service Commission, naming reformers Dorman Bridgman Eaton, John Milton Gregory, and Leroy D. Thoman as commissioners. The commission issued its first rules in May 1883; by 1884, half of all postal officials and three-quarters of the Customs Service jobs were to be awarded by merit. During his first term, President Grover Cleveland expanded the number of federal positions subject to the merit system from 16,000 to 27,000. Partly due to Cleveland&#x27;s efforts, between 1885 and 1897, the percentage of federal employees protected by the Pendleton Act would rise from twelve percent to approximately forty percent. Under subsequent legislation, about 90% of federal employees are covered by the merit system.

In the short term, however, the act largely failed to achieve the stated objectives of its supporters. As long as candidates passed the newly created exams, the bureau and division chiefs were left with free rein to appoint whomever they wished to the positions. The patronage system had not been eliminated, it had simply moved the power created by this system to these chiefs. The act also largely failed to accomplish the goal of stopping the practice of bureaucratic officials being dismissed and replaced after each election along partisan lines. Though the act prevented new presidents from directly dismissing officials whenever they wished, the new system only protected officials for a given &quot;term&quot;, which most often ran for four years (the same length as a single presidential term). Presidents would simply wait for these terms to expire and then appoint new officials along partisan lines, with a net result of officials only holding their positions a few months longer than they previously would under the system of arbitrary dismissals.

The law also caused major changes in campaign finance. Prior to the act, political parties often acquired much of their funds through taking a percentage of the fees earned by officials they appointed to federal offices. With such officials being prohibited by the act from contributing to political campaigns, parties were forced to look for new sources of campaign funds, such as wealthy donors.

Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 as a major update to the Pendleton Act. The Civil Service Commission was abolished and its functions were replaced by the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The 1978 law created the Senior Executive Service for top managers within the civil service system, and established the right of civil servants to unionize and arbitrate.

In January 1981, the Jimmy Carter administration settled the court case Luévano v. Campbell, which alleged the Professional and Administrative Careers Examination (PACE) was racially discriminatory as a result of the lower average scores and pass rates achieved by Black and Hispanic test takers. As a result of this settlement agreement, PACE, the main entry-level test for candidates seeking positions in the federal government’s executive branch, was scrapped. It has not been replaced by a similar general exam, although attempts at replacement exams have been made. The system which replaced the general PACE exam has been criticized as instituting a system of racial quotas, although changes to the settlement agreement under the Ronald Reagan administration removed explicit quotas, and these changes &quot;raised serious questions about the ability of the government to recruit a quality workforce while reducing adverse impact&quot;, according to Professor Carolyn Ban.

In October, 2020, then-President Donald Trump, by created a Schedule F classification in the excepted service of the United States federal civil service for policy-making positions, which was criticized by Professor Donald Kettl as violating the spirit of the Pendleton Act. 

Shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Joe Biden rescinded Executive Order 13957 by issuing .

On January 20, 2025, then-newly reelected President Trump issued his Executive Order titled &quot;Restoring Accountability To Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce&quot; to restore the effects of his own prior Executive Order 13957.

<text>Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett (; 11 June 1847 – 5 August 1929) was an English political activist and writer. She campaigned for women&#x27;s suffrage by legal change and in 1897–1919 led Britain&#x27;s largest women&#x27;s rights association, the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), explaining, &quot;I cannot say I became a suffragist. I always was one, from the time I was old enough to think at all about the principles of Representative Government.&quot; She tried to broaden women&#x27;s chances of higher education, as a governor of Bedford College, London (now Royal Holloway) and co-founding Newnham College, Cambridge in 1875. In 2018, a century after the Representation of the People Act, she was the first woman honoured by a statue in Parliament Square.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Fawcett was born on 11 June 1847 in Aldeburgh, to Newson Garrett (1812–1893), a businessman from nearby Leiston, and his London wife Louisa (&quot;née&quot; Dunnell, 1813–1903). She was the eighth of their ten children.

According to the Stracheys, &quot;The Garretts were a close and happy family in which children were encouraged to be physically active, read widely, speak their minds, and share in the political interests of their father, a convert from Conservatism to Gladstonian Liberalism, a combative man, and a keen patriot.&quot;

As a child, Fawcett&#x27;s elder sister Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, who became Britain&#x27;s first female doctor, introduced her to Emily Davies, an English suffragist. In her mother&#x27;s biography, Louisa Garrett Anderson quotes Davies as saying to her mother, to Elizabeth and to Fawcett, &quot;It is quite clear what has to be done. I must devote myself to securing higher education, while you open the medical profession to women. After these things are done, we must see about getting the vote.&quot; She then turned to Millicent: &quot;You are younger than we are, Millie, so you must attend to that.&quot;

Aged twelve in 1858, Millicent Fawcett was sent to London with her sister Elizabeth to attend a private boarding school in Blackheath. Millicent found Louisa Browning who led the school to be a &quot;born teacher&quot; whereas her sister remembered the &quot;stupidity&quot; of the teachers. Her sister Louise took her to the sermons of Frederick Denison Maurice, a socially aware and less traditional Anglican priest, whose opinions influenced her view of religion. In 1865, she attended a lecture by John Stuart Mill. The following year, she and a friend, Emily Davies, supported the Kensington Society by collecting signatures for a petition asking Parliament to enfranchise women householders.

===Marriage and family===

John Stuart Mill introduced Millicent Fawcett to many other women&#x27;s rights activists, including Henry Fawcett, a Liberal Member of Parliament who had intended to marry her sister Elizabeth before she decided to focus on her medical career. Millicent and Henry married on 23 April 1867. Henry had been blinded in a shooting accident in 1858 and Millicent acted as his secretary. Their marriage was said to be based on &quot;perfect intellectual sympathy&quot;; Millicent pursued a writing career while caring for Henry, and ran two households, one in Cambridge, one in London. The family together held strong beliefs in favor of proportional representation, individualistic and free trade principles, and advancement for women. Their only child was Philippa Fawcett, born in 1868, who was much encouraged by her mother in her studies. In 1890 Philippa became the first woman to obtain top score in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams.

In 1868 Millicent joined the London Suffrage Committee, and in 1869 spoke at the first public pro-suffrage meeting held in London. In March 1870 she spoke in Brighton, her husband&#x27;s constituency. As a speaker she was said to have a clear voice. In 1870 she published her short &quot;Political Economy for Beginners&quot;, which was &quot;wildly successful&quot;, running through 10 editions in 41 years. In 1871 she contributed an article to Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine entitled &quot;A short explanation of Mr. Hare&#x27;s scheme of representation,&quot; concerning single transferable voting. In 1872 she and her husband published &quot;Essays and Lectures on Social and Political Subjects&quot;, containing eight essays by Millicent. In 1875 she co-founded Newnham Hall and served on its council.

Despite many interests and duties, Millicent, with Agnes Garrett, raised four of their cousins, who had been orphaned early in life: Amy Garrett Badley, Fydell Edmund Garrett, Elsie Garrett (later a prominent botanical artist in South Africa), and Elsie&#x27;s twin, John.

After Fawcett&#x27;s husband died on 6 November 1884, she temporarily withdrew from public life, sold both family homes and moved with Philippa to the house of her sister, Agnes Garrett. When she resumed work in 1885, she began to concentrate on politics and was a key member of what became the Women&#x27;s Local Government Society. Originally a Liberal, she joined the Liberal Unionist Party in 1886 to oppose Irish Home Rule. She, like many English Protestants, felt that allowing home rule for Catholic Ireland would hurt England&#x27;s prosperity and be disastrous for the Irish. In 1885, she had also voiced her support for W. T. Stead over his term of imprisonment.

In 1891 Fawcett wrote the introduction to a new edition of Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s book &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;. Lyndall Gordon calls this an &quot;influential essay&quot;; Fawcett reasserted the reputation of the early feminist philosopher and claimed her as an early figure in the struggle for the vote.

Fawcett was granted an honorary doctorate of law by the University of St Andrews in 1899.

==Political activities==
Fawcett mainly fought for women&#x27;s suffrage. She stated that Irish home rule would be &quot;a blow to the greatness and prosperity of England as well as disaster and... misery and pain and shame&quot;. At a young age she published essays on the need for proportional representation, &quot;electoral disabilities of women&quot;, &quot;education of women&quot; and addressing the national debt.

Fawcett began her political career at the age of 22, at the first women&#x27;s suffrage meeting. After the death of Lydia Becker, Fawcett became leader of the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), Britain&#x27;s main suffragist organisation. Politically she took a moderate position, distancing herself from the militancy and direct actions of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU), which she believed would harm women&#x27;s chances of winning the vote by souring public opinion and alienating members of Parliament. Despite the publicity for the WSPU, the NUWSS with its slogan &quot;Law-Abiding suffragists&quot; retained more support. By 1905, Fawcett&#x27;s NUWSS had 305 constituent societies and almost 50,000 members, compared with the WSPU&#x27;s 2,000 members in 1913.

She explains her disaffiliation from the more militant movement in her book &quot;What I Remember&quot;:
The South African War gave a chance to Fawcett to share female responsibilities in British culture. She was nominated to lead a commission of women sent to South Africa, sailing there in July 1901 with other women &quot;to investigate Emily Hobhouse&#x27;s indictment of atrocious conditions in concentration camps where the families of the Boer soldiers were interned.&quot; No British women had been entrusted before with such a task in wartime. Millicent fought for the civil rights of the Uitlanders &quot;as the cause of revival of interest in women&#x27;s suffrage&quot;.

Fawcett had backed countless campaigns over many years, for instance to curb child abuse by raising the age of consent, criminalise incest and cruelty to children within the family, end the practice of excluding women from courtrooms when sexual offences were considered, stamp out the &quot;white slave trade&quot;, and prevent child marriage and the introduction of regulated prostitution in India. Fawcett campaigned to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, as reflecting sexual double standards. They required prostitutes to be examined for sexually transmitted diseases and if found to have passed disease to their clients, to be imprisoned. Women could be arrested on suspicion of being a prostitute and imprisoned for refusing consent to examinations that were invasive and painful. The men who infected the women were not subject to the Acts, which were repealed through campaigning by Fawcett and others. She believed such double standards would never be erased until women were represented in the public sphere.

Fawcett wrote three books, one co-authored with her husband, and many articles, some published posthumously. Her &quot;Political Economy for Beginners&quot; went into ten editions, sparked two novels, and appeared in many languages. One of her first articles on women&#x27;s education appeared in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1875, the year when her interest in women&#x27;s education led her to become a founder of Newnham College for Women in Cambridge. There she served on the college council and backed a controversial bid for all women to receive Cambridge degrees. Millicent regularly spoke at girls&#x27; schools, women&#x27;s colleges and adult education centres. In 1904, she resigned from the Unionists over free trade, when Joseph Chamberlain gained control in his campaign for tariff reform.

When the First World War broke out in 1914, the WSPU ceased all activities to focus on the war effort. Fawcett&#x27;s NUWSS replaced her political activity with support for hospital services in training camps, Scotland, Russia and Serbia, largely because the organisation was markedly less militant than the WSPU: it contained many more pacifists and support for the war within it was weaker. The WSPU was called jingoistic for its leaders&#x27; strong support for the war. While Fawcett was no pacifist, she risked dividing the organisation if she ordered a halt to the campaign and diverted NUWSS funds to the government as the WSPU had. The NUWSS continued to campaign for the vote during the war and used the situation to its advantage by pointing out the contribution women had made to the war effort. She held her post until 1919, a year after the first women had received the vote under the Representation of the People Act 1918. After that, she left the suffrage campaign and devoted time to writing books, including a biography of Josephine Butler.

==Later years==
In 1919 Fawcett was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Birmingham. In the 1925 New Year Honours she was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE).

Fawcett died in 1929 at her London home in Gower Street, Bloomsbury. She was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium although the final resting place of her ashes is unknown.

In 1932, a memorial to Fawcett, alongside that of her husband, was unveiled in Westminster Abbey with an inscription: &quot;A wise constant and courageous Englishwoman. She won citizenship for women.&quot;

==Legacy==
Millicent Fawcett Hall was constructed in 1929 in Westminster as a place for women&#x27;s debates and discussions; presently owned by Westminster School, the hall is used by the drama department as a 150-seat studio theatre. Saint Felix School, near Fawcett&#x27;s birthplace of Aldeburgh, has named one of its boarding houses after her. A blue plaque for Fawcett was erected in 1954 by London County Council at her home of 45 years in Bloomsbury. The archives of Millicent Fawcett are held at The Women&#x27;s Library, London School of Economics, which in 2018 renamed one of its campus buildings Fawcett House in honor of her role in the British suffrage movement and her connections to the area.

In February 2018, Fawcett won a BBC Radio 4 poll asking Britons to name the most influential woman of the past 100 years.

The Millicent Fawcett Mile is an annual one-mile running race for women, inaugurated in 2018 at the Müller Anniversary Games in London.

==Commemoration==
In 2018, 100 years after the passing of the Representation of the People Act, for which Fawcett had successfully campaigned and which granted limited franchise, she became the first woman commemorated with a statue in Parliament Square, by the sculptor Gillian Wearing. This followed a campaign led by Caroline Criado Perez, in which over 84,000 online signatures were gathered.
Fawcett&#x27;s statue holds a banner quoting from a speech she gave in 1920, after Emily Davison&#x27;s death during the 1913 Epsom Derby: &quot;Courage calls to courage everywhere&quot;. At its unveiling Theresa May said, &quot;I would not be standing here today as Prime Minister, no female MPs would have taken their seats in Parliament, none of us would have the rights we now enjoy, were it not for one truly great woman: Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett.&quot;

<doc id="55667" wikidata="Q781376" url="?curid=55667" title="Spoils system">
<text>In politics and government, a spoils system (also known as a patronage system) is a practice in which a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends (cronyism), and relatives (nepotism) as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party. It contrasts with a merit system, where offices are awarded or promoted on the basis of some measure of merit, independent of political activity.

The term was used particularly in politics of the United States, where the federal government operated on a spoils system until the Pendleton Act was passed in 1883 due to a civil service reform movement. Thereafter the spoils system was largely replaced by nonpartisan merit at the federal level of the United States.

The term was derived from the phrase &quot;to the victor belong the spoils&quot; by New York Senator William L. Marcy, referring to the victory of Andrew Jackson in the election of 1828, with the term &quot;spoils&quot; meaning goods or benefits taken from the loser in a competition, election or military victory.

Similar spoils systems are common in other nations that traditionally have been based on tribal organization or other kinship groups and localism in general.

==Origins==
Although it is commonly thought that the spoils system was introduced by President Andrew Jackson, historical evidence does not support this view. Patronage came to the United States during its Colonial history, whereas in its modern form, the spoils system got introduced into U.S. politics during the administration of George Washington, whose outlook generally favored members of the Federalist Party. Sometimes, Washington is accused of introducing the system himself. In addition, both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson have also been accused, to a degree, of introducing the spoils system to U.S. politics.

In 1828, moderation was expected to prevail in the transfer of political power from one U.S. president to another. This had less to do with the ethics of politicians than it did with the fact the presidency had not transferred from one party to another since the election of 1800—known historically for the extraordinary steps the outgoing Federalist Party took to try and maintain as much influence as possible by exploiting their control over federal appointments up until their final hours in office (see: &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; and Midnight Judges Act). By 1816, the Federalists were no longer nationally viable, and the U.S. became effectively a one-party polity under the Democratic-Republican Party. The Jacksonian split after the 1824 election restored the two-party system. Jackson&#x27;s first inauguration, on March 4, 1829, marked the first time since 1801 where one party yielded the presidency to another. A group of office seekers attended the event, explaining it as democratic enthusiasm. Jackson supporters had been lavished with promises of positions in return for political support. These promises were honored by a large number of removals after Jackson assumed power. At the beginning of Jackson&#x27;s administration, fully 919 officials were removed from government positions, amounting to nearly 10 percent of all government postings. In 1913 a history of Tennessee commented, &quot;It is said that in early life Jackson had made it a principle never to stand between a friend and a benefit. The converse seemed also to have been a principle: never to benefit an enemy. And those who were excluded from his friendship were excluded from preferment.&quot;
The Jackson administration aimed at creating a more efficient system where the chain of command of public employees all obeyed the higher entities of government. The most-changed organization within the federal government proved to be the Post Office. The Post Office was the largest department in the federal government, and had even more personnel than the War Department. In one year, 423 postmasters were deprived of their positions, most with extensive records of good service. Jackson did not differ much from other Presidents in the number of officials he replaced by his own partisans. There was, however, an increase in outright criminality , with a measurable if not marked increase in corruption in the Land Office, Post Office, and Indian affairs departments. Jackson&#x27;s replacement of 29 of 56 U.S. Indian agents was critical to his administration&#x27;s systematic expulsion of Indigenous people from the lands east of the Mississippi River because it removed any institutional resistance and left &quot;several zealous officers at the top who had little sympathy for indigenous Americans, and dozens of inexperienced, patronage appointees at the bottom.&quot;

Jackson was also accused of dabbling in nepotism for the benefit of his family network of wards, in-laws, and nephews. As one history of public administration described, &quot;During Jackson&#x27;s administration the policy of political patronage and nepotism in federal employment was intensified, partly because of his belief that rotation of government jobs was an essentially democratic process. What this actually implies is that political nepotism is not corruption, but one of the principles of sound democracy. This is, of course, ridiculous!&quot; In 1831, &quot;A Corn Planter of Madison County&quot; called out the political appointments and government-funded salaries of Jackson&#x27;s kinsmen Stockley D. Hays, John Coffee, John C. McLemore, A. J. Donelson, and R. I. Chester, asking &quot;Have we, sir, no high minded and honorable men amongst is, who are qualified to offices of honor, profit, and trust, but the nephews of President Jackson?&quot;

==Reform==
By the late 1860s, citizens began demanding civil service reform, but it was only after the 1881 assassination of James A. Garfield by Charles J. Guiteau as revenge for the latter being denied a consulship that the calls for civil service reform intensified. Moderation of the spoils system at the federal level with the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883, which created a bipartisan Civil Service Commission to evaluate job candidates on a nonpartisan merit basis. While few jobs were covered under the law initially, the law allowed the President to transfer jobs and their current holders into the system, thus giving the holder a permanent job. The Pendleton Act&#x27;s reach was expanded as the two main political parties alternated control of the White House every election between 1884 and 1896. Following each election, the outgoing President applied the Pendleton Act to some of the positions for which he had appointed political supporters. By 1900, most federal jobs were handled through civil service, and the spoils system was limited to fewer and fewer positions.

Although state patronage systems and numerous federal positions were unaffected by the law, Karabell argues that the Pendleton Act was instrumental in the creation of a professional civil service and the rise of the modern bureaucratic state. The law also caused major changes in campaign finance, as the parties were forced to look for new sources of campaign funds, such as wealthy donors.

The separation between political activity and the civil service was made stronger with the Hatch Act of 1939 which prohibited federal employees from engaging in many political activities.

The spoils system survived much longer in many states, counties and municipalities, such as the Tammany Hall machine, which survived until the 1950s when New York City reformed its own civil service. Illinois modernized its bureaucracy in 1917 under Frank Lowden, but Chicago held on to patronage in city government until the city agreed to end the practice in the Shakman Decrees of 1972 and 1983. Some federal positions such as ambassadorships have continued to be assigned to political supporters into the present day, leading to criticism that they remain part of the spoils system.

<text>The Chinese Exclusion Act was a United States federal law signed by President Chester A. Arthur on May 6, 1882, prohibiting all immigration of Chinese laborers for 10 years. The law made exceptions for merchants, teachers, students, travelers, and diplomats. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first major US law ever implemented to prevent all members of a specific national group from immigrating to the United States, and therefore helped shape twentieth-century race-based immigration policy.

Passage of the law was preceded by growing anti-Chinese sentiment and anti-Chinese violence, as well as various policies targeting Chinese migrants. The act followed the Angell Treaty of 1880, a set of revisions to the US–China Burlingame Treaty of 1868 that allowed the US to suspend Chinese immigration. The act was initially intended to last for 10 years, but was renewed and strengthened in 1892 with the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902. These laws attempted to stop all Chinese immigration into the United States for ten years, with exceptions for diplomats, teachers, students, merchants, and travelers. The laws were widely evaded.

In 1898, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot; that the law did not prevent the children of Chinese immigrants born in the United States from acquiring birthright citizenship.

The law remained in force until the passage of the Magnuson Act in 1943, which repealed the exclusion and allowed 105 Chinese immigrants to enter the United States each year. Chinese immigration later increased with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which abolished direct racial barriers, and later by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished the National Origins Formula.

== Background ==

The Opium Wars (1839–1842; 1856–1860) fought between China and Great Britain, in addition to drought and floods, left many Chinese people destitute and sent many unemployed farmers to start new lives in the Americas.


The first significant Chinese immigration to America began with the California gold rush of 1848–1855; it continued with subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the first transcontinental railroad. During the early stages of the gold rush, when surface gold was plentiful, the Chinese were tolerated by white people, if not well received. However, as gold became harder to find and competition increased, animosity toward the Chinese and other foreigners increased. After being forcibly driven from mining by a mixture of state legislators and other miners (the Foreign Miner&#x27;s Tax), the immigrant Chinese began to settle in enclaves in cities, mainly San Francisco, and took up low-wage labor, such as restaurant and laundry work. With the post-Civil War economy in decline by the 1870s, the anti-Chinese animosity became politicized by labor leader Denis Kearney and his Workingman&#x27;s Party as well as by California governor John Bigler, both of whom blamed &quot;coolie labor&quot; for depressed wage levels. In addition to economic pressures, US cultural products had long promoted racist views of Chinese people. Public opinion and law in California began to demonize Chinese workers and immigrants in any role, with the latter half of the 1800s seeing a series of ever more restrictive laws being placed on Chinese labor, behavior and even living conditions. While many of these legislative efforts were quickly overturned by the State Supreme Court, many more anti-Chinese laws continued to be passed in both California and nationally.

In the early 1850s, there was resistance to the idea of excluding Chinese migrant workers, since they provided essential tax revenue. The Xianfeng Emperor, who ruled China at the time, supported the exclusion because he was concerned that Chinese immigration to America would lead to a loss of labor for China. But toward the end of the decade, the financial situation improved and state level exclusion laws were passed. In 1858, the California Legislature passed a law that made it illegal for any person &quot;of the Chinese or Mongolian races&quot; to enter the state; however, this law was struck down by the State Supreme Court in 1862.

The Chinese immigrant workers provided cheap labor and did not use government schools, hospitals, and such because the Chinese migrant population was predominantly healthy male adults. January 1868, the Senate ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese into the country. As time passed and more and more Chinese migrants arrived in the United States and California in particular, violence often broke out in cities such as Los Angeles. The North Adams strike of 1870, broken by the replacement of all workers by 75 Chinese men was the trigger that sparked widespread working-class protest across the country, shaped legislative debate in Congress, and helped make Chinese immigration a sustained national issue.

The Page Act of 1875 banned Chinese women from entering the United States to prevent the settlement of families, but continued to allow Chinese men and their labor.

Key to the transformation of Chinese immigration from a Californian to a national question was the political climate in 1876. This year was an election year and was exceedingly close with both parties looking to the West Coast for aid in the coming election, it was through this that Californian politicians were able to project their concerns with Chinese immigration eastward into discourse in the capital. Before 1876, Californian legislators had made various attempts to restrict Chinese immigration by targeting Chinese businesses, living spaces and the ships immigrants arrived on by way of ordinances and resultant fines, but such legislation was deemed unconstitutional through its violation of either the Burlingame Treaty, the Fourteenth Amendment, or the Civil Rights Act of 1866. In light of such failures, It became clear that the issue had to be solved by the federal government. For Californian politicians advocating against Chinese immigration, therefore, the close political competition in 1876 provided a good opportunity to propel their cause from a state issue to a national issue. The idea was that the desire for West Coast votes would compel the political parties to adopt policies to appeal to Californian voters, by making known the heavy anti-Chinese sentiment in California, Californian anti-Chinese legislators could influence political parties into adopting an anti-Chinese immigration rhetoric. This influence was conducted in a manner of ways; Firstly, throughout the spring many well-publicized anti-Chinese demonstrations were held, such as in San Francisco on April 5 which saw 20,000 people attend. Secondly, on April 3, the California State Senate authorized an investigation on the effects of Chinese immigration on the state&#x27;s culture and economy, with the findings to be sent to &#x27;leading newspapers of the United States&#x27; and 5 copies for each member of Congress. Furthering these measures was the sending of a delegation by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to cities in the east to express anti-Chinese sentiment to crowds (and later newspapers). Members of this delegation Philip Roach and Frank Pixley talked about the economic threat Chinese &#x27;coolie&#x27; labor posed, but also on the perceived racial incompatibility and inferiority of Chinese immigrants, driving up fears and anxieties in other states. These remarks also found their way to senate hearings, such an example can be seen on May 1: Republican Aaron A. Sargent, the senior senator for California, addressed the senate with a vicious attack on Chinese immigration before they voted on treaty negotiations with China. The result of these efforts, among others, culminated in the overwhelming support of anti-Chinese policies by both political parties observed in their respective conventions in June. It is for these reasons then that the election year of 1876 was instrumental in changing the question of Chinese immigration from a state to a national question; The competitive political atmosphere allowed a calculated political attempt to nationalize California&#x27;s Immigration grievances, as such leaders across the country (whose concerns with the benefits or ill of Chinese-labour were second to winning votes) were compelled to advocacy for anti-Chinese sentiment.

Numerous strikes followed the Adams strike, notably Beaver Falls Cutlery Company in Pennsylvania and others After the economy soured in the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen&#x27;s wages. At one point, Chinese men represented nearly a quarter of all wage-earning workers in California. By 1878, Congress felt compelled to try to ban immigration from China in legislation that was later vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The title of the August 27, 1873, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; article, &quot;The Chinese Invasion! They Are Coming, 900,000 Strong&quot;, was traced by &quot;The Atlantic&quot; as one of the roots of the 2019 anti-immigration &quot;invasion&quot; rhetoric. Furthermore, in 1876, the San Francisco lawyer H. N. Clement stood before a California State Committee and said: &quot;The Chinese are upon us. How can we get rid of them? The Chinese are coming. How can we stop them?&quot;. This perfectly reflected the overall feeling of many Americans at the time, and how public officials were partly responsible in making this situation seem even more serious than it actually was.

In 1879, however, California adopted a new Constitution which explicitly authorized the state government to determine which individuals were allowed to reside in the state, and banned the Chinese from employment by corporations and state, county or municipal governments.

Three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude working-class Chinese laborers; Senator John F. Miller of California introduced another Chinese Exclusion Act that blocked entry of Chinese laborers for a twenty-year period. The bill passed the Senate and House by overwhelming margins, but this as well was vetoed by President Chester A. Arthur, who concluded the 20-year ban to be a breach of the renegotiated treaty of 1880. That treaty allowed only a &quot;reasonable&quot; suspension of immigration. Eastern newspapers praised the veto, while it was condemned in the Western states. Congress was unable to override the veto, but passed a new bill reducing the immigration ban to ten years. The House of Representatives voted 201–37, with 51 abstentions, to pass the act. Although he still objected to this denial of entry to Chinese laborers, President Arthur acceded to the compromise measure, signing the Chinese Exclusion Act into law on May 6, 1882.
After the act was passed, most Chinese workers were faced with a dilemma: stay in the United States alone or return to China to reunite with their families. Although widespread dislike for the Chinese persisted well after the law itself was passed, of note is that some capitalists and entrepreneurs resisted their exclusion because they accepted lower wages.

When the exclusion act expired in 1892, congress extended it 10 more years in the form of the Geary Act. This extension was then made permanent in 1902 which led to every Chinese American ordered to gain a certificate of residence from the US government or face deportation. This act regulated Chinese immigration into the 20th century.

== Content ==
The Act was the first US immigration law to target a specific ethnicity or nationality. The earlier Page Act of 1875 had prohibited immigration of Asian forced laborers and sex workers, and the Naturalization Act of 1790 prohibited naturalization of non-white subjects. The Chinese Exclusion Act excluded Chinese laborers, meaning &quot;skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining&quot;, from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation.

The Chinese Exclusion Act required the few non-laborers who sought entry to obtain certification from the Chinese government that they were qualified to emigrate. However, this group found it increasingly difficult to prove that they were not laborers because the 1882 Act defined excludables as &quot;skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining&quot;. Thus very few Chinese could enter the country under the 1882 law. Diplomatic officials and other officers on business, along with their house servants, for the Chinese government were also allowed entry as long as they had the proper certification verifying their credentials.

The Chinese Exclusion Act also affected the Chinese who had already settled in the United States. Any Chinese who left the United States had to obtain certifications for reentry, and the act made Chinese immigrants permanent aliens by excluding them from US citizenship. After the act&#x27;s passage, Chinese men in the US had little chance of ever reuniting with their wives, or of starting families in their new abodes.

Amendments made in 1884 tightened the provisions that allowed previous immigrants to leave and return and clarified that the law applied to ethnic Chinese regardless of their country of origin. The 1888 Scott Act expanded upon the Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibiting reentry into the US after leaving. Only teachers, students, government officials, tourists, and merchants were exempt.

Constitutionality of the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Scott Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in &quot;Chae Chan Ping v. United States&quot; (1889); the Supreme Court declared that &quot;the power of exclusion of foreigners [is] an incident of sovereignty belonging to the government of the United States as a part of those sovereign powers delegated by the constitution&quot;. The act was renewed for ten years by the 1892 Geary Act, and again with no terminal date in 1902. When the act was extended in 1902, it required &quot;each Chinese resident to register and obtain a certificate of residence. Without a certificate, he or she faced deportation.&quot;

Between 1882 and 1905, about 10,000 Chinese appealed against negative immigration decisions to federal court, usually via a petition for habeas corpus. In most of these cases, the courts ruled in favor of the petitioner. Except in cases of bias or negligence, these petitions were barred by an act that passed Congress in 1894 and was upheld by the US Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Lem Moon Sing&quot; (1895). In &quot;United States v. Ju Toy&quot; (1905), the US Supreme Court reaffirmed that the port inspectors and the Secretary of Commerce had final authority on who could be admitted. Ju Toy&#x27;s petition was thus barred despite the fact that the district court found that he was an American citizen. The Supreme Court determined that refusing entry at a port does not require due process and is legally equivalent to refusing entry at a land crossing. All these developments, along with the extension of the act in 1902, triggered a boycott of US goods in China between 1904 and 1906. There was one 1885 case in San Francisco, however, in which Treasury Department officials in Washington overturned a decision to deny entry to two Chinese students.

One of the critics of the Chinese Exclusion Act was the anti-imperialist senator George Frisbie Hoar, a Republican from Massachusetts who described the act as &quot;nothing less than the legalization of racial discrimination&quot;.

The laws were driven largely by racial concerns; immigration of persons of other races was not yet limited. On the other hand, most people and unions strongly supported the Chinese Exclusion Act, including the American Federation of Labor and Knights of Labor, a labor union, who supported it because it believed that industrialists were using Chinese workers as a wedge to keep wages low. Among labor and leftist organizations, the Industrial Workers of the World were the sole exception to this pattern. The IWW openly opposed the Chinese Exclusion Act from its inception in 1905.
The racial concerns the Exclusion Act drew justification from were along the lines of a perceived &#x27;moral deficiency&#x27; of Chinese immigrants, this charge stipulated the inherent unreliability and dishonesty of the immigrants on behalf of their race. These assumptions of character were frequently assigned on behalf of the poor communities these immigrants lived in with higher density, higher crime, saloons and opium dens. This is however not an exhaustive list of charges brought against Chinese immigrants, many more assumptions were made such as them bringing leprosy to US shores. Some of the main proponents of this racialism were Irish immigrants in the West, the reason for this was that although granted entry under the Naturalization Act of 1790 as a free &#x27;white&#x27; people, the large numbers of immigrants from Europe starting in the 1840s created a situation where different white ethnicities were being made out to be more or less desirable compared to Anglo-Saxons. In such a way the Celtic Irish in the east faced similar racialism at the hands of nativists, being categorized as &#x27;dirty&#x27;, &#x27;drunken&#x27;, and &#x27;animalistic papists&#x27;. In this way, under Denis Kearney and the Workingman&#x27;s Party, many Irish immigrants who had migrated westward sought to shore up their &#x27;whiteness&#x27; and redirect stereotypes about themselves by stressing the undesirability of the Chinese, non-white immigrants.

For all practical purposes, the Chinese Exclusion Act, along with the restrictions that followed it, froze the Chinese community in place in 1882. Limited immigration from China continued until the repeal of the act in 1943. From 1910 to 1940, the Angel Island Immigration Station on what is now Angel Island State Park in San Francisco Bay served as the processing center for most of the 56,113 Chinese immigrants who are recorded as immigrating or returning from China; upwards of 30% more who arrived there were returned to China. The Chinese population in the US declined from approximately 105,000 in 1880, to 89,000 in 1900, and to 61,000 in 1920.

Certain federal agencies were active in the 19th century to enforce the Exclusion Act. The Customs Service took the lead on this because of the maritime nature. In the 1900s the Office of the Superintendent of Immigration was established by the Department of the Treasury and given responsibility for implementing federal regulations mandated by the Chinese exclusion laws. This organization is now known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).

The act exempted merchants, and restaurant owners could apply for merchant visas beginning in 1915 after a federal court ruling. This led to the rapid growth of Chinese restaurants in the 1910s and 1920s as restaurant owners could leave and reenter along with family members from China.

Later, the Immigration Act of 1924 restricted immigration even further, excluding all classes of Chinese immigrants and extending restrictions to other Asian immigrant groups. Until these restrictions were relaxed in the middle of the twentieth century, Chinese immigrants were forced to live a life separated from their families, and to build ethnic enclaves in which they could survive on their own (Chinatown). The Chinese Exclusion Act did not address the problems that whites were facing; in fact, the Chinese were quickly and eagerly replaced by the Japanese, who assumed the role of the Chinese in society. Unlike the Chinese, some Japanese were even able to climb the rungs of society by setting up businesses or becoming truck farmers. However, the Japanese were later targeted in the Immigration Act of 1924, which banned immigration from East Asia entirely. The Chinese Exclusion Act was a tool with an aim to, maintain cheap accessible labor while stopping the excess population of Chinese immigrants from taking jobs from white Americans.

In 1891, the Chinese government refused to accept US Senator Henry W. Blair as US Minister to China due to his abusive remarks regarding China during negotiations of the Chinese Exclusion Act. The American Christian George F. Pentecost spoke out against Western imperialism in China, saying:

I personally feel convinced that it would be a good thing for America if the embargo on Chinese immigration were removed. I think that the annual admission of 100,000 into this country would be a good thing for the country. And if the same thing were done in the Philippines those islands would be a veritable Garden of Eden in twenty-five years. The presence of Chinese workmen in this country would, in my opinion, do a very great deal toward solving our labor problems. There is no comparison between the Chinaman, even of the lowest coolie class, and the man who comes here from Southeastern Europe, from Russia, or from Southern Italy. The Chinese are thoroughly good workers. That is why the laborers here hate them. I think, too, that the emigration to America would help the Chinese. At least he would come into contact with some real Christian people in America. The Chinaman lives in squalor because he is poor. If he had some prosperity his squalor would cease.

== The &quot;Driving Out&quot; period ==
Following the passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a period known as the &quot;Driving Out&quot; era was born. In this period, anti-Chinese Americans physically forced Chinese communities to flee to other areas. Large scale violence in Western states included the Rock Springs massacre (1885) and the Hells Canyon massacre (1887).

=== Rock Springs massacre of 1885 ===
The massacre was named for the town where it took place, Rock Springs, Wyoming, in Sweetwater County, where white miners were jealous of the Chinese for their employment. White miners expressed their jealous frustration by robbing, bullying, shooting, and stabbing the Chinese in Chinatown. The Chinese tried to flee but many were burned alive in their homes, starved to death in hidden refuge, or exposed to carnivorous animal predators in the mountains. Some were rescued by a passing train, but by the end of the event at least twenty-eight lives had been taken. In an attempt to appease the situation, the government intervened by sending federal troops to protect the Chinese. However, only compensations for destroyed property were paid. No one was arrested nor held accountable for the atrocities committed during the riot.

=== Hells Canyon massacre of 1887 ===
The massacre was named for the location where it took place, along the Snake River in Hells Canyon near the mouth of Deep Creek. The area contained many rocky cliffs and white rapids that together posed significant danger to human safety. 34 Chinese miners were killed at the site. The miners were employed by the Sam Yup company, one of the six largest Chinese companies at the time, which worked in this area since October 1886. The actual events are still unclear due to unreliable law enforcement at the time, biased news reporting, and lack of serious official investigations. However, it is speculated that the dead Chinese miners were not victims of natural causes, but rather victims of gun shot wounds during a robbery committed by a gang of seven armed horse thieves. Gold worth $4,000–$5,000 was thought to have been stolen from the miners. The gold was never recovered nor further investigated.

==== Aftermath ====
Shortly following the incident, the Sam Yup company of San Francisco hired Lee Loi who later hired Joseph K. Vincent, then US Commissioner, to lead an investigation. Vincent submitted his investigative report to the Chinese consulate who tried unsuccessfully to obtain justice for the Chinese miners. At around the same time, other compensation reports were also unsuccessfully filed for earlier crimes inflicted on the Chinese. In the end, on October 19, 1888, Congress agreed to greatly under-compensate for the massacre and ignore the claims for the earlier crimes. Even though the amount was greatly underpaid, it was still a small victory to the Chinese who had low expectations for relief or acknowledgement.

==== Issues of the act ====
The Chinese Exclusion Act created fear and violence within Chinese communities as a result of immigration raids made legal through the Chinese Exclusion Act. During these raids they were at risk of being questioned, detained, or physically or verbally assaulted. Targeting the Chinese was a day-to-day risk due to the anti-Chinese sentiment generated through the Chinese Exclusion Act their community was in danger.

An issue with the Chinese Exclusion act is that it established &#x27;gatekeeping ideologies&#x27; within the US. Demonstrated through the act&#x27;s mythological approach to restrict, exclude, and deport those believed to be &#x27;undesirable&#x27;. The qualities associated with being &#x27;undesirable&#x27; were categorized through individuals&#x27; race, gender, and class. Purposely excluding those who worked to build America, contribute to their economy, and build a home. This was the first American law &#x27;gatekeeping&#x27; the country based on those who were not seen as worthy enough to enter based on race.

Another issue was there were many workarounds that people quickly created to bypass the Chinese Exclusion Act. Chinese women would travel to Canada to get a marriage license in order to reunite with their families. Men and women would walk across the American border intending to be arrested, to demand to go to court and claim they were born in America through providing a witness of their birth. While the American and Canadian government did discover these workarounds and new laws were created, these methods still were accessible for several years after the exclusion act.

== Impact ==
A 2024 study found that the legislation harmed the labor market integration of Chinese immigrants in the United States. In response to the discrimination they faced, Chinese immigrants increasingly invested in education, adopted Americanized names, and enhanced their English proficiency.

=== US–China relations ===
In the American effort to change many aspects of the Burlingame Treaty, the US took advantage of China&#x27;s weakened position on the international stage. China was dealing with various challenging situations, such as the French government establishing a protectorate over Vietnam, which was a tributary country to China for a long time. More importantly, it faced the Senkaku Islands dispute with Japan. Ex-President Ulysses S. Grant visited China in 1879, Viceroy Li Hongzhang, an important diplomat, told Grant that if the US helped China pressure the Japanese out of Senkaku Islands, he would make a concession on the Chinese immigration issue. This paved the way for the Angell Treaty of 1880, which greatly diminished Chinese immigrants&#x27; rights and interests. The Angell Treaty opened the door for the complete prohibition of Chinese immigrants, as politicians realized that the immigrant question was not a priority for the Chinese government, and that China was weak, meaning that even if they had violate the treaties, China would not invade or create major problems. Overall, this shows how the US used its foreign relations with China to achieve its own domestic objectives.

Prior to the approval of the act, relations between China and the United States were generally positive. This was mainly because of the Burlingame Treaty, a treaty which included the right of Chinese people to free immigration and travel within the US, and protection of Chinese citizens residing in the United States. Moreover, the treaty gave the two countries reciprocal access to education and schooling when living in the other country. Although the US viewed China as an inferior partner, nevertheless the relationship was positive. American politicians and presidents continued to maintain and uphold the treaty, for example, President Rutherford B. Hayes vetoed bills that contrasted the Burlingame Treaty. As tensions grew domestically in the US however, Hayes began a revision of the Treaty and China agreed to limit immigration to the US However, once discussions began to enforce the Chinese Exclusion Act, and the law was then passed, &quot;the Chinese Government considered this a direct insult&quot;. Furthermore, when the US extended the law to Hawaii and the Philippines in 1902, this was greatly objected by the Chinese government and people, who viewed America as a bullish and imperial power who undermined China.

=== Chinese women ===
The Chinese Exclusion Act had many impacts on Chinese women. As such, unique categories were created in the act to prevent their entry, so that the main way they immigrated was through marrying Chinese or native men. The interrogation was similar to male workers, except they had specific questions regarding bound feet in the early period: women with feet that had been bound tended to be from wealthy families, unbound feet were a sign of being from a low class and so were seen as less desirable by US border officers.

Many women were forced to find alternative immigration methods to be able to reunify with loved ones after the Chinese Exclusion Act. Women would marry or even remarry their partners in Canada so that they were approved for immigration to join their merchant husbands in America. These women navigated and successfully overcame the US government in their many workarounds of the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Chinese Exclusion Act significantly impacted single women. Married women had better chances of immigration due to their merchant husbands. However, for single women it was nearly impossible to immigrate. Often the presumption was if they were single Chinese women they were prostitutes or were to be sold into prostitution.

=== US education ===
Recruitment of foreign students to US colleges and universities was an important component in the expansion of American influence. International education programs allowed students to learn from the examples provided at elite universities and to bring their newfound skill sets back to their home countries. As such, international education has historically been seen as a vehicle for improving diplomatic relations and promoting trade. However, the Chinese Exclusion Act forced Chinese students attempting to enter the country to provide proof that they were not trying to bypass regulations. Laws and regulations that stemmed from the act made for less than ideal situations for Chinese students, leading to criticisms of American society. Policies and attitudes toward Chinese Americans in the US worked against foreign policy interests by limiting the ability of the US to participate in international education initiatives.

=== US economy ===
The departure of many skilled and unskilled Chinese workers led to an across-the-board decline. Mines and manufacturers in California, where the majority of Chinese immigrants resided, closed and wages did not climb as anticipated. Furthering this, the value of agricultural produce declined due to falling demand reflective of the diminished population. Joaquin Miller remarked in 1901 that since the Chinese departure, property value in Californian cities had remained at a standstill and capital investment had been hesitant.

=== Race-based US legislation ===
The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first legislation that prohibited entry to an immigrant based on race and class. In this way, it facilitated further restriction by both being the model by which future groups could be radicalized as unassimilable aliens, and by also marking a moment where such discrimination could be justifiable. The Chinese Exclusion Act&#x27;s method of &quot;radicalizing&quot; the Chinese as a threat to America&#x27;s values and working class, &quot;containing&quot; the danger by limiting their social and geographic mobility, and &quot;defending&quot; America through expulsion became the foundation of America&#x27;s &quot;gatekeeping&quot; ideology. The Immigration Act of 1924 placed quotas on all nationalities apart from Northwestern Europe, this could be seen as building off the gatekeeping ideology established with the Chinese Exclusion Act. Public perceptions of many immigrant groups such as Southern and Eastern Europeans in the late 19th and early 20th century had become one of &quot;undesirability&quot; when compared to those with Anglo-Saxon heritage, this was due largely to popular nativity attitudes and accepted racialism. In this way, the restriction of these groups by 1924 compared to their Northwestern &quot;desirable&quot; counterparts could be seen to be carrying on the discrimination by perceived racial inferiority of immigrants that started with the Chinese Exclusion Act.

== Repeal and status ==
The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed by the 1943 Magnuson Act when China had become an ally of the US against Japan in World War II, as the US needed to embody an image of fairness and justice. The Magnuson Act permitted Chinese nationals already residing in the country to become naturalized citizens and stop hiding from the threat of deportation. The act also allowed Chinese people to send remittances to people of Chinese descent living in mainland China, Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan and other countries or territories, especially if the funding is not tied to criminal activity. However, the Magnuson Act only allowed a national quota of 105 Chinese immigrants per year and did not repeal the restrictions on immigration from the other Asian countries. The crackdown on Chinese immigrants reached a new level in its last decade, from 1956 to 1965, with the Chinese Confession Program launched by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, that encouraged Chinese who had committed immigration fraud to confess, so as to be eligible for some leniency in treatment. Large-scale Chinese immigration did not occur until the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.

The first Chinese immigrants who entered the United States under the Magnuson Act were college students who sought to escape the warfare in China during World War II and study in the US. The establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and its entry into the Korean War against the US, however, created a new threat in the minds of some American politicians: American-educated Chinese students bringing American knowledge back to &quot;Red China&quot;. Many Chinese college students were almost forcibly naturalized, even though they continued to face significant prejudice, discrimination, and bullying. One of the most prolific of these students was Tsou Tang, who would go on to become the leading expert on China and Sino-American relations during the Cold War.

Although the Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed in 1943, the law in California prohibiting non-whites from marrying whites was not struck down until 1948, in which the California Supreme Court ruled the ban of interracial marriage within the state unconstitutional in &quot;Perez v. Sharp&quot;. Some other states had such laws until 1967, when the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled in &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; that anti-miscegenation laws across the nation are unconstitutional.

Currently (as of December 2024), although all its constituent sections have long been repealed, Chapter 7 of Title 8 of the United States Code is headed &quot;Exclusion of Chinese&quot;. It is the only chapter of the 15 chapters in Title 8 (Aliens and Nationality) that is completely focused on a specific nationality or ethnic group. Like the following Chapter 8, &quot;The Cooly Trade&quot;, it consists entirely of statutes that are noted as &quot;Repealed&quot; or &quot;Omitted&quot;.

On June 18, 2012, the US House of Representatives passed , a resolution introduced by Congresswoman Judy Chu which formally expresses the regret of the House of Representatives for the Chinese Exclusion Act. , a similar resolution, had been approved by the US Senate in October 2011.

In 2014, the California Legislature took formal action to pass measures that formally recognize the accomplishments of Chinese Americans in California and to call upon Congress to formally apologize for the 1882 adoption of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Senate Republican leader Bob Huff (R-Diamond Bar) and incoming Senate president pro-Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) served as joint authors for Senate Joint Resolution (SJR) 23 and Senate Concurrent Resolution (SCR) 122, respectively.

Both SJR 23 and SCR 122 acknowledge and celebrate the history and contributions of Chinese Americans in California. The resolutions also formally call on Congress to apologize for laws that resulted in the persecution of Chinese Americans, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act.

Perhaps most important are the sociological implications for understanding ethnic/race relations in the context of American history; minorities tend to be punished in times of economic, political, and/or geopolitical crises. However, times of social and systemic stability tend to mute any underlying tensions between different groups. In times of societal crisis—whether perceived or real—patterns of retractability of American identities have erupted to the forefront of America&#x27;s political landscape, often generating institutional and civil society backlash against workers from other nations, a pattern documented by Fong&#x27;s research into how crises drastically alter social relationships.

<text>The Convention for the Unification of certain rules relating to international carriage by air, commonly known as the Warsaw Convention, is an international convention which regulates liability for international carriage of persons, luggage, or goods performed by aircraft for reward.

Originally signed in 1929 in Warsaw (hence the name), it was amended in 1955 at The Hague, Netherlands, and in 1971 in Guatemala City, Guatemala. United States courts have held that, at least for some purposes, the Warsaw Convention is a different instrument from the Warsaw Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol.

The Montreal Convention, signed in 1999, replaced the Warsaw Convention system in countries ratifying it.

==History==
On 17 August 1923, the French government proposed the convening of a diplomatic conference In November 1923 for the purpose of concluding a convention relating to liability in international carriage by air. The conference was formally deferred on two occasions due to reluctant behavior of the governments of various nations to act on such a short notice without the knowledge of the proposed convention. Finally, between 27 October and 6 November, the first conference met in Paris to study the draft convention. Since most of the participants were diplomats accredited to the French government and not professionals, it was agreed unanimously that a body of technical, legal experts be set up to study the draft convention prior to its submission to the diplomatic conference for approval. Accordingly, the International Technical Committee of Legal Experts on Air Questions (&quot;Comité International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aériens&quot;, CITEJA) was formed in 1925. In 1927–28 CITEJA studied and developed the proposed draft convention and developed it into the present package of unification of law and presented it at the Warsaw Conference, where it was approved between 4 and 12 October 1929. It unified an important sector of private air law.

The convention was written originally in French and the original documents were deposited in the archives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Poland. After coming into force on 13 February 1933, it resolved some conflicts of law and jurisdiction.

Between 1948 and 1951 it was further studied by a legal committee set up by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and in 1952 a new draft was prepared to replace the convention. However it was rejected and it was decided that the convention be amended rather than replaced in 1953. The work done by the legal committee at the Ninth Session was presented to the International Conference on Air Law which was convened by the council of the ICAO and met at The Hague from 6 to 28 September 1955. The Hague Conference adopted a Protocol (the Hague Protocol) for the amendment of the Warsaw Convention. Between the parties of the Protocol, it was agreed that the 1929 Warsaw Convention and the 1955 Hague Protocol were to be read and interpreted together as one single instrument to be known as the Warsaw Convention as amended at the Hague in 1955. This was not an amendment to the convention but rather a creation of a new and separate legal instrument that is only binding between the parties. If one nation is a party to the Warsaw Convention and another to the Hague Protocol, neither state has an instrument in common and therefore there is no mutual international ground for litigation.

Finally, the Montreal Convention, signed in 1999, replaced the Warsaw Convention system.

==Content==
There are five chapters:
*Chapter I – Definitions
*Chapter II – Documents of Carriage; Luggage and Passenger Ticket
*Chapter III – Liability of the Carrier
*Chapter IV – Provisions Relating to Combined Carriage
*Chapter V – General and Final Provisions

In the convention there is a provision of successive carriage and a combined carriage partly by air and partly by other modes of transport as well.

In particular, the Warsaw Convention:
*Defines &quot;international carriage&quot; and the convention&#x27;s scope of applicability
*Sets rules for documents of carriage
*Sets rules for the air carrier&#x27;s liability and limitations thereof
*Sets rules for legal jurisdiction
*Mandates carriers to issue passenger tickets;
*Requires carriers to issue baggage checks for checked luggage;
*Creates a limitation period of two years within which a claim must be brought (Article 29); and
*Limits a carrier&#x27;s liability to at most:
** 250,000 Francs or 16,600 special drawing rights (SDR) for personal injury;
** 250 Francs or 19 SDR per kilogram for checked luggage and cargo, or US$20 per kilogram for non-signatories of the amended Montreal Convention; 
** 5,000 Francs or 332 SDR for the hand luggage of a traveller.

The sums limiting liability were originally given in gold francs (defined in terms of a particular quantity of gold by article 22 paragraph 5 of the convention). These sums were amended by the Montreal Additional Protocol No. 2 to substitute an expression given in terms of SDRs. These sums are valid in the absence of a differing agreement (on a higher sum) with the carrier. Agreements on &quot;lower&quot; sums are null and void.

A court may also award a claiming party&#x27;s costs, unless the carrier made an offer within 6 months of the loss (or at least 6 months before the beginning of any legal proceedings) which the claiming party has failed to beat.

The Warsaw Convention provides that a plaintiff can file a lawsuit at his or her discretion in one of the following forums:
# The carrier&#x27;s principal place of business
# The domicile of the carrier
# The carrier&#x27;s place of business through which the contract was made
# The place of the destination

According to Clauses 17 and 18 of the Warsaw Convention, airline companies are liable for any damage that occurs to passengers or their belongings during in-flight. However, airline companies will not be held responsible if the damage results from the passenger&#x27;s own fault or one of their temporary servants such as doctors assisting ill passengers on their own initiative (Clause 20). To be covered by air carriers, doctors should respond to the captain&#x27;s call when it comes to assisting ill passengers. In such cases, doctors are considered an airline&#x27;s temporary servants who acted on the airline&#x27;s instructions. Major airlines are all covered by insurance to meet such contingencies and to cover doctors who act as their temporary agents.

==Ratifications==
As of 2015, the Warsaw Convention had been ratified by 152 states. The protocol to the convention had been ratified by 137 states.

<doc id="55671" wikidata="Q661062" url="?curid=55671" title="Connotation">
<text>A connotation is a commonly understood cultural or emotional association that any given word or phrase carries, in addition to its explicit or literal meaning, which is its denotation.

A connotation is frequently described as either positive or negative, with regard to its pleasing or displeasing emotional connection. For example, a stubborn person may be described as being either &quot;strong-willed&quot; or &quot;pig-headed&quot;; although these have the same literal meaning (&quot;stubborn&quot;), &quot;strong-willed&quot; connotes admiration for the level of someone&#x27;s will (a positive connotation), while &quot;pig-headed&quot; connotes frustration in dealing with someone (a negative connotation).

==Usage==
&quot;Connotation&quot; branches into a mixture of different meanings. These could include the contrast of a word or phrase with its primary, literal meaning (known as a denotation), with what that word or phrase specifically denotes. The connotation essentially relates to how anything may be associated with a word or phrase; for example, an implied value, judgement or feelings.

===Logic===
In logic and semantics, &quot;connotation&quot; is roughly synonymous with &quot;intension&quot;. Connotation is often contrasted with &quot;denotation&quot;, which is more or less synonymous with &quot;extension&quot;. Alternatively, the connotation of the word may be thought of as the set of all its possible referents (as opposed to merely the actual ones). A word&#x27;s &quot;denotation&quot; is the collection of things it refers to; its connotation is what it implies about the things it is used to refer to (a second level of meanings is termed connotative). The connotation of dog is (something like) four-legged canine carnivore. So, saying, &quot;You are a dog&quot; would &quot;connote&quot; that you were ugly or aggressive rather than literally &quot;denoting&quot; you as a canine.

===Related terms===
It is often useful to avoid words with strong connotations (especially pejorative or ones) when striving to achieve a neutral point of view. A desire for more positive connotations, or fewer negative ones, is one of the main reasons for using euphemisms.

Semiotic closure, as defined by Terry Eagleton, concerns &quot;a sealed world of ideological stability, which repels the disruptive, decentered forces of language in the name of an imaginary unity. Signs are ranked by a certain covert violence into rigidly hierarchical order. . . . The process of forging ‘representations’ always involves this arbitrary closing of the signifying chain, constricting the free play of the signifier to a spuriously determinate meaning which can then be received by the subject as natural and inevitable&quot;.

<doc id="55678" wikidata="Q1647715" url="?curid=55678" title="Interstate Commerce Commission">
<text>The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) was a regulatory agency in the United States created by the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. The agency&#x27;s original purpose was to regulate railroads (and later trucking) to ensure fair rates, to eliminate rate discrimination, and to regulate other aspects of common carriers, including interstate bus lines and telephone companies. Congress expanded ICC authority to regulate other modes of commerce beginning in 1906. Throughout the 20th century, several of ICC&#x27;s authorities were transferred to other federal agencies. The ICC was abolished in 1995, and its remaining functions were transferred to the Surface Transportation Board.

The Commission&#x27;s five members were appointed by the President with the consent of the United States Senate. This was the first independent agency (or so-called &quot;Fourth Branch&quot;).

==Creation==
The ICC was established by the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, which was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. The creation of the commission was the result of widespread and longstanding anti-railroad agitation. Western farmers, specifically those of the Grange Movement, were the dominant force behind the unrest, but Westerners generally — especially those in rural areas — believed that the railroads possessed economic power that they systematically abused. A central issue was rate discrimination between similarly situated customers and communities. Other potent issues included alleged attempts by railroads to obtain influence over city and state governments and the widespread practice of granting free transportation in the form of yearly passes to opinion leaders (elected officials, newspaper editors, ministers, and so on) so as to dampen any opposition to railroad practices.

Various sections of the Interstate Commerce Act banned &quot;personal discrimination&quot; and required shipping rates to be &quot;just and reasonable.&quot;

President Cleveland appointed Thomas M. Cooley as the first chairman of the ICC. Cooley had been Dean of the University of Michigan Law School and Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court.

==Initial implementation and legal challenges==
The Commission had a troubled start because the law that created it failed to give it adequate enforcement powers.

Following the passage of the 1887 act, the ICC proceeded to set maximum shipping rates for railroads. However, in the late 1890s, several railroads challenged the agency&#x27;s ratemaking authority in litigation, and the courts severely limited the ICC&#x27;s powers. 

The ICC became the United States&#x27; investigation agency for railroad accidents.

==Expansion of ICC authority==
Congress expanded the commission&#x27;s powers through subsequent legislation. The 1893 Railroad Safety Appliance Act gave the ICC jurisdiction over railroad safety, removing this authority from the states, and this was followed with amendments in 1903 and 1910. The Hepburn Act of 1906 authorized the ICC to set maximum railroad rates, and extended the agency&#x27;s authority to cover bridges, terminals, ferries, sleeping cars, express companies and oil pipelines.

A long-standing controversy was how to interpret language in the Act that banned long haul-short haul fare discrimination. The Mann-Elkins Act of 1910 addressed this question by strengthening ICC authority over railroad rates. This amendment also expanded the ICC&#x27;s jurisdiction to include regulation of telephone, telegraph and wireless companies.

The Valuation Act of 1913 required the ICC to organize a Bureau of Valuation that would assess the value of railroad property. This information would be used to set rates. The Esch-Cummins Act of 1920 expanded the ICC&#x27;s rate-setting responsibilities, and the agency in turn required updated valuation data from the railroads. The enlarged process led to a major increase in ICC staff, and the valuations continued for almost 20 years. The valuation process turned out to be of limited use in helping the ICC set rates fairly.

In 1934, Congress transferred the telecommunications authority to the new Federal Communications Commission.

In 1935, Congress passed the Motor Carrier Act, which extended ICC authority to regulate interstate bus lines and trucking as common carriers.

==Ripley Plan to consolidate railroads into regional systems==
The Transportation Act of 1920 directed the Interstate Commerce Commission to prepare and adopt a plan for the consolidation of the railway properties of the United States into a limited number of systems. Between 1920 and 1923, William Z. Ripley, a professor of political economy at Harvard University, wrote up ICC&#x27;s plan for the regional consolidation of the U.S. railways. His plan became known as the &quot;Ripley Plan&quot;. In 1929 the ICC published Ripley&#x27;s Plan under the title &quot;Complete Plan of Consolidation&quot;. Numerous hearings were held by ICC regarding the plan under the topic &quot;In the Matter of Consolidation of the Railways of the United States into a Limited Number of Systems&quot;.

===Plan rejected===
Many small railroads failed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Of those lines that survived, the stronger ones were not interested in supporting the weaker ones. Congress repudiated Ripley&#x27;s Plan with the &quot;Transportation Act of 1940,&quot; and the consolidation idea was scrapped.

==Racial integration of transport==
Although racial discrimination was never a major focus of its efforts, the ICC had to address civil rights issues when passengers filed complaints.

===History===
* April 28, 1941 - In &quot;Mitchell v. United States,&quot; the United States Supreme Court ruled that discrimination in which a colored man who had paid a first class fare for an interstate journey was compelled to leave that car and ride in a second class car was essentially unjust, and violated the Interstate Commerce Act. The court thus overturns an ICC order dismissing a complaint against an interstate carrier.
*June 3, 1946 - In &quot;Morgan v. Virginia,&quot; the Supreme Court invalidates provisions of the Virginia Code which require the separation of white and colored passengers where applied to interstate bus transport. The state law is unconstitutional insofar as it is burdening interstate commerce, an area of federal jurisdiction.
* June 5, 1950 - In &quot;Henderson v. United States,&quot; the Supreme Court rules to abolish segregation of reserved tables in railroad dining cars. The Southern Railway had reserved tables in such a way as to allocate one table conditionally for blacks and multiple tables for whites; a black passenger traveling first-class was not served in the dining car as the one reserved table was in use. The ICC ruled the discrimination to be an error in judgement on the part of an individual dining car steward; both the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and the Supreme Court disagreed, finding the published policies of the railroad itself to be in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act.
* September 1, 1953 - In &quot;Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company,&quot; Women&#x27;s Army Corps private Sarah Keys, represented by civil rights lawyer Dovey Johnson Roundtree, becomes the first black person to challenge the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine in bus segregation before the ICC. While the initial ICC reviewing commissioner declined to accept the case, claiming &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) &quot;did not preclude segregation in a private business such as a bus company,&quot; Roundtree ultimately prevailed in obtaining a review by the full eleven-person commission.
* November 7, 1955 – ICC bans bus segregation in interstate travel in &quot;Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company.&quot; This extends the logic of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; a precedent ending the use of &quot;separate but equal&quot; as a defence against discrimination claims in education, to bus travel across state lines.
* December 5, 1960 - In &quot;Boynton v. Virginia,&quot; the Supreme Court holds that racial segregation in bus terminals is illegal because such segregation violates the Interstate Commerce Act. This ruling, in combination with the ICC&#x27;s 1955 decision in &quot;Keys v. Carolina Coach,&quot; effectively outlaws segregation on interstate buses and at the terminals servicing such buses.
* September 23, 1961 - The ICC, at Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s insistence, issues new rules ending discrimination in interstate travel. Effective November 1, 1961, six years after the commission&#x27;s own ruling in &quot;Keys v. Carolina Coach Company,&quot; all interstate buses required to display a certificate that reads: &quot;Seating aboard this vehicle is without regard to race, color, creed, or national origin, by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.&quot;

==Criticism==
The limitation on railroad rates in 1906-07 depreciated the value of railroad securities, a factor in causing the panic of 1907.

Some economists and historians, such as Milton Friedman assert that existing railroad interests took advantage of ICC regulations to strengthen their control of the industry and prevent competition, constituting regulatory capture.

Economist David D. Friedman argues that the ICC always served the railroads as a cartelizing agent and used its authority over other forms of transportation to prevent them, where possible, from undercutting the railroads.

In March 1920, the ICC had Eben Moody Boynton, the inventor of the Boynton Bicycle Railroad, committed as a lunatic to an institution in Washington, D.C. Boynton&#x27;s monorail electric light rail system, it was reported, had the potential to revolutionize transportation, superseding then-current train travel. ICC officials said that they had Boynton committed because he was &quot;worrying them to death&quot; in his promotion of the bicycle railroad. Based on his own testimony and that of a Massachusetts congressman, Boynton won release on May 28, 1920, overcoming testimony of the ICC&#x27;s chief clerk that Boynton was virtually a daily visitor at ICC offices, seeking Commission adoption of his proposal to revolutionize the railroad industry.

==Abolition==
Congress passed various deregulation measures in the 1970s and early 1980s which diminished ICC authority, including the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (&quot;4R Act&quot;), the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 and the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma strongly advocated the abolition of the Commission. In December 1995, when most of the ICC&#x27;s powers had been eliminated or repealed, Congress finally abolished the agency with the ICC Termination Act of 1995. Final Chair Gail McDonald oversaw transferring its remaining functions to a new agency, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), which reviews mergers and acquisitions, rail line abandonments and railroad corporate filings.

ICC jurisdiction on rail safety (hours of service rules, equipment and inspection standards) was transferred to the Federal Railroad Administration pursuant to the &quot;Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970.&quot;

Before the ICC was abolished motor carriers (bus lines, trucking companies) had safety regulations enforced by the Office of Motor Carriers (OMC) under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The OMC inherited many of the &quot;Economic&quot; regulations enforced by the ICC in addition to the safety regulations imposed on motor carriers. In January 2000 the OMC became the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), within the U.S. Department of Transportation. Prior to its abolition, the ICC gave identification numbers to motor carriers for which it issued licenses. The identification numbers were generally in the form of &quot;ICC MC-000000&quot;. When the ICC was dissolved, the function of licensing interstate motor carriers was transferred to FMCSA. All interstate motor carriers that transport freight moving across state lines have a USDOT number, such as &quot;USDOT 000000.&quot; There are private carriers, e.g. Walmart that move their own freight requiring only a USDOT number, and carriers with authority that haul freight for hire that are still required to have a USDOT number and a Motor Carrier (MC) number that replaced the ICC numbers.

==Legacy==
The ICC served as a model for later regulatory efforts. Unlike, for example, state medical boards (historically administered by the doctors themselves), the seven Interstate Commerce Commissioners and their staffs were full-time regulators who could have no economic ties to the industries they regulated. Since 1887, some state and other federal agencies adopted this structure. And, like the ICC, later agencies tended to be organized as multi-headed independent commissions with staggered terms for the commissioners. At the federal level, agencies patterned after the ICC included the Federal Trade Commission (1914), the Federal Communications Commission (1934), the Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), the National Labor Relations Board (1935), the Civil Aeronautics Board (1940), Postal Regulatory Commission (1970) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (1975).

In recent decades, this regulatory structure of independent federal agencies has gone out of fashion. The agencies created after the 1970s generally have single heads appointed by the President and are divisions inside executive Cabinet Departments (e.g., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (1970) or the Transportation Security Administration (2002)). The trend is the same at the state level, though it is probably less pronounced.

===International influence===
The Interstate Commerce Commission had a strong influence on the founders of Australia. The Constitution of Australia provides (; also ) for the establishment of an Inter-State Commission, modeled after the United States&#x27; Interstate Commerce Commission. However, these provisions have largely not been put into practice; the Commission existed between 1913–1920, and 1975–1989, but never assumed the role which Australia&#x27;s founders had intended for it.

<doc id="55680" wikidata="Q2562095" url="?curid=55680" title="Peter the Aleut">
<text>Cungagnaq (; date of birth unknown - d. 1815) is venerated as a martyr and saint (as Peter the [[Aleut]]; ) by the Eastern Orthodox Church. He was a native of Kodiak Island (Alutiiq or Sugpiaq), and received the Christian name of Peter when he was baptized into the Orthodox faith by the monks of St Herman&#x27;s missionaries operating in the north. He was captured by Spanish soldiers near San Pedro and tortured and killed at the instigation of Roman Catholic priests either there or at a nearby location. At the time identified for his death, California was Spanish territory, and Spain was worried about Russian advances southwards from Alaska. Hubert Howe Bancroft, in his multi-volume &quot;History of California&quot;, only notes that, in connection with an incident wherein a Russian fur-hunting expedition was taken into custody after declining to leave San Pedro; one Russian source accused &quot;the Spaniards of cruelty to the captives, stating that according to Kuskof’s report one Aleut who refused to become a Catholic died from ill-treatment received from the padre at San Francisco.&quot;

==Martyrdom==
According to the most fully developed version of the story, in 1815 a group of Russian employees of the Russian American Company and their Aleut seal and otter hunters, including Peter, was captured by Spanish soldiers, while hunting illicitly for seals near San Pedro, (which has variably been interpreted as either San Pedro, Los Angeles or as San Pedro y San Pablo Asistencia (in Pacifica, California). According to the original account, the soldiers took them to &quot;the mission in Saint-Pedro&quot; for interrogation. One Russian source states that after being taken prisoner near modern Los Angeles, the captives were taken to Mission Dolores—that is, modern San Francisco. With threats of torture, the Roman Catholic priests attempted to force the Aleuts to deny their Orthodox faith and to convert to Roman Catholicism.

When the Aleuts refused, the priest had a toe severed from each of Peter&#x27;s feet. Peter still refused to renounce his faith and the Spanish priest ordered a group of Native Americans, indigenous to California, to cut off each finger of Peter&#x27;s hands, one joint at a time, finally removing both his hands. They eventually disemboweled him, making him a martyr to the Eastern Orthodox faith. The Spanish captors were about to torture the next Aleut when orders were received to release the other Russian and Native Alaskan prisoners.

==Historicity==
An account of the martyrdom of Peter the Aleut is contained in a lengthy letter written on November 22, 1865, by Semyon Yanovsky to Damascene, abbot of the Valaam Monastery in Finland. Yanovsky (1789–1876), who is also one of the chief sources of information about St. Herman of Alaska, was chief manager of the Russian colonies from 1818 to 1820. In the letter he was reporting on an incident that he had heard from a supposed eyewitness, and that had taken place fifty years earlier in 1815. The letter contains the description of Peter being tortured by &quot;Jesuits&quot; but this would have been virtually impossible, as the Jesuit order had been expelled from all Spanish territories in 1767, suppressed generally in 1773, and had only been reconstituted in 1814 (one year before Peter&#x27;s alleged death). In 1815 there were no Jesuits within several thousand miles of California, as the reconstitution of the Jesuits in New Spain (that is, Mexico) would not take place until 1816. There were only Franciscans in California at the time, and it would be highly unlikely that anyone could confuse members of the two well-known and very dissimilar orders. Yanovsky adds, &quot;At the time I reported all this to the Head Office in St. Petersburg.&quot; And indeed, this earlier communication, his official dispatch to the company&#x27;s main office—dated Feb. 15, 1820, five years after the event—also relates the story of St. Peter&#x27;s martyrdom, albeit with different details.

==Location of martyrdom and &quot;San Pedro&quot;==
Peter the Aleut has been referred to as a &quot;martyr of San Francisco&quot;. Additionally, many modern descriptions of the martyrdom of Peter the Aleut often describe the event as occurring &quot;in San Francisco&quot;, and others describe the Native Alaskan traders as being brought &quot;to San Francisco&quot;. Other sources can be found describing the event as occurring near Los Angeles or in Southern California. These varying descriptions of the location may be based on varying oral traditions, varying understandings of the relationship of the location of the martyrdom and Fort Ross, and also on varying interpretations of references to &quot;San Pedro&quot; in the original historical documents.

The earliest historical sources about the death of Peter the Aleut describe the event as taking place in or near &quot;the mission of San Pedro&quot;. Some have taken this to refer to San Pedro y San Pablo Asistencia, a &quot;sub-mission&quot; of Mission San Francisco de Asís (also known as Mission Dolores). San Pedro y San Pablo Asistencia was located on the site of the modern-day Sánchez Adobe Park in modern-day Pacifica, California.

Others have interpreted the historical description to refer to the dock in San Pedro, Los Angeles (now located in modern-day Los Angeles), which was used at the time as a trading post by Spanish missionary friars from Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. Such an interpretation of &quot;San Pedro&quot; fits well with other references to geographical locations in the historical documents, including an island named Santa Rosa (interpreted to refer to Santa Rosa Island) an island named &quot;Climant&quot; (interpreted to refer to San Clemente Island) and an island named Ekaterina, (interpreted by some to refer to Catalina Island). These documents also describe the captured Native Alaskan traders as transferred to Fort Ross, by way of sequential stops in Santa Barbara and Monterey. This interpretation of a Southern Californian location for the martyrdom is further supported by a letter contemporaneous to the alleged martyrdom event from Franciscan Fr. José Francisco de Paula Señan dated June 19, 1816 (but which runs counter to allegations of forced conversion and violence against the Native hunters from Russian America), which describes the capture and transfer of &quot;Russian Indians&quot; to the Santa Barbara Presidio from Mission San Buenaventura (in modern-day Ventura, California).

==Veneration==
 According to Yanovsky&#x27;s 1865 letter, upon receiving the report of Peter&#x27;s death, St. Herman on Kodiak Island was moved to cry out, &quot;Holy new-martyr Peter, pray to God for us!&quot; Peter the Aleut was glorified as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and locally glorified by the Diocese of Alaska of the Orthodox Church in America as the &quot;Martyr of San Francisco&quot; in 1980. His feast day is celebrated on September 24 or December 12. A number of churches have been dedicated to him in North America, including churches at Lake Havasu City, Arizona, Minot, North Dakota, Calgary, and Abita Springs, Louisiana.

<text>A time-out is a form of behavioral modification that involves temporarily separating a person from an environment where an unacceptable behavior has occurred. The goal is to remove that person from an enriched, enjoyable environment, and therefore lead to extinction of the offending behavior. It is an educational and parenting technique recommended by most pediatricians and developmental psychologists as an effective form of discipline. During time-outs, a corner or a similar space is designated, where the person is to sit or stand (hence the common term &quot;corner time&quot;). This form of discipline is especially popular in Western cultures.

In the UK, the punishment is often known as the naughty step or naughty chair. This term became popular in the US thanks to two reality TV series, &quot;Supernanny&quot; and &quot;Nanny 911&quot;.

==History==
The concept of time-out was invented, named, and used by Arthur W. Staats in his extended work with his daughter (and later son), and was part of a long-term program of behavioral analysis beginning in 1958 that treated various aspects of child development. He introduced various elements that later composed foundations for applied behavior analysis and behavior therapy. (The token reward system was another invention by him.) Montrose Wolf, a graduate student assistant of Staats on several studies dealing with reading learning in preschoolers, used that background when he went to the University of Washington where he began his creative program of research. Wolf began the widespread use of Staats&#x27; time-out procedure in extending training methods to an autistic child (see the 1964 published study dealing with the behavioral treatment of a child).

Staats described the discipline of his two-year-old daughter in 1962: &quot;I would put her in her crib and indicate that she had to stay there until she stopped crying. If we were in a public place [where her behavior was inappropriate], I would pick her up and go outside.&quot;

== Application ==
For Staats, the timeout period was ended when the child&#x27;s misbehavior, such as crying inappropriately, ended. He considered removal from a positive emotional environment to one of lesser positivity as a very mild punishment. Various people have added their opinions regarding time-out as the following indicates.

Time out is a type two punishment procedure (negative punishment), and is used commonly in schools, colleges, offices, clinics and homes. To implement time out, a caregiver removes the child from a reinforcing activity for a short period of time, usually 5 to 15 minutes, in order to discourage inappropriate behavior and teach the child that engaging in problem behavior will result in decreased access to reinforcing items and events in the child&#x27;s environment.

Time-outs may be on a chair, step, corner, bedroom, in front of or beside a door, or any other location where there are no distractions and reduced access to fun items, activities and people. This procedure is preferable to other punishments such as reprimanding, yelling at or spanking the child for their misbehavior, which are type one punishments (positive punishment). Time out time for children is usually a time for a child to think about the unacceptable behavior that he or she engaged in, instead of a time to read books, play with toys, listen to music, or watch TV. Engaging in other unacceptable behaviors during timeout, such as attempting to inflict serious injuries on a child&#x27;s own body, destroying items in the child&#x27;s own bedroom, or engaging in any other type of inappropriate behavior, including excessive crying, can result in additional disciplinary action such as a grounding being imposed on a child, or additional time being spent in time out.
A child can also have books and toys and other privileges taken away as well for any of the above stated behaviors taking place during a timeout.
Research has established that 15 minutes is the maximum time that a child should be kept in time out. However, shorter durations may be just as effective for behavior change.

For this disciplinary technique to be most effective and to produce the desired results, the child should be old enough to sit still and is required to remain there for a fixed period. Also, according to developmental psychologists, parents should evaluate each situation to determine what may be causing the misbehavior, such as a toy, frustration, hunger, or lack of sleep, and then address any underlying needs before a punishment contingency should be used. Any time they are trying to reduce a problem behavior, parents should be sure that they are also teaching and reinforcing the desired replacement behavior. Parents should also clearly explain why the child is being put in time out, and what the child needs to do to return to the reinforcing environment/be let out of time-out (but too much explanation can reinforce the unwanted behavior as a result of &quot;misplaced adult attention&quot;). Furthermore, the renown developmental psychologist Kathleen Stassen Berger suggests that time-out should remain brief, proposing a general guideline: the length of time that the child should remain in time-out should correlate with the child&#x27;s age – each year of the child&#x27;s age constitutes one minute in time-out.

Time-out is one behavior control method based on removing positive reinforcement for a brief time. Less elaborate methods from the same class like tactical ignoring, or planned ignoring, also can be effective in cases where parental/caregiver attention is the positive reinforcement for negative behavior. This class of methods are more effective if the child gets a significant amount positive reinforcement (praise, attention) for good behavior. All punishment procedures can evoke other problem behaviors, damage rapport, or evoke escape or avoidant behaviors. For this, and other ethical reasons, behavior analysts exhaust all options for using differential reinforcement and/or extinction procedures to reduce problem behavior, before considering the use of punishment procedures.

==Effectiveness==
Several studies show that time-out is an especially effective disciplinary strategy, reducing aggressive and non-compliant behavior, when other positive parenting methods are also used. Meta-analytic evidence suggests time-out is highly effective at reducing problem behavior in young oppositional defiant children, and increasing child compliance. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology have issued statements supporting the use of time-outs as a disciplinary tool.

In order for time-out to be effective, the non-time-out or &quot;time-in&quot; environment must be sufficiently reinforcing in contrast to the time-out environment, making time-out an unwanted experience. 

There are differences between strategies for ending time out. Some proponents of time-outs insist on silence and stillness from the child during the time-out, or the use of a &quot;release-contingency,&quot; where the child is required to be sitting peacefully at the end of the time-out period. However, the majority of research does not consistently suggest that these type of contingencies improve the effectiveness of time-outs, though no research suggests that they are harmful.

Those who use time-out for children to get anger and frustration &quot;out of their system&quot; or for children to think about their behavior are using time-out in a way that is different than those basing it on operant conditioning principles (that time-out from positive reinforcement may reduce recurrences of the unwanted target behavior).

In a study by Donaldson and Vollmer, the efficacy of a fixed duration time-out and a release contingency time-out were compared. In the fixed duration condition, children were sent to time-out for a total of 4 minutes and were released from time-out whether or not they performed problem behavior during the time-out session. In the release contingency condition, children were not released from time-out if they were performing problem behavior during the last 30 seconds of their time-out. The time-out was extended until there were no occurrences of problem behavior for a total of 30 seconds or until the time-out reached the ten-minute mark. Results showed that both time-out procedures were successful in reducing the problem behavior for the subjects. The subjects in the release contingency did not benefit from staying in time-out for an extended period of time either. Moreover, the results show that only four minutes is necessary for a successful time-out procedure.

The effectiveness of time-out also varies with each individual child, dependent on the child&#x27;s age, temperament and emotional wellness.

In September 2019, a study published by the University of Michigan concluded that using timeouts to discipline children was not harmful to them nor was it found to be harmful to children&#x27;s relationships with their parents. The eight-year study found that children disciplined with timeouts did not display increased levels of anxiety or aggression.
==Disadvantages==
Critics of time-out include Thomas Gordon, Gabor Mate, Alfie Kohn and Aletha Solter, who claim that the approach may lead to short-term compliance but has the same disadvantages as other forms of punishment. According to these authors, the use of time-out does not enhance moral behavior or teach children useful conflict-resolution skills and it fails to address the underlying cause of the behavior. Furthermore, they claim that the parent/child bond can be damaged by forced isolation and withdrawal of love in an effort to control a child&#x27;s behavior and this can lead to feelings of insecurity or anxiety in children, though there is no evidence that this occurs.

In addition to the potential psychological drawbacks resulting from the use of time-out, there also appears to be a risk to the child&#x27;s developing brain, according to research in neuroscience by Daniel J. Siegel. &quot;In a brain scan, relational pain (that caused by isolation during punishment) can look the same as physical abuse,&quot; and &quot;Repeated experiences actually change the physical structure of the brain.&quot; The Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology issued a response to Siegel, arguing that his claims were &quot;outrageous&quot; and unsupported by research. Dr. Siegel later backed away from this statement and claimed that Time Magazine distorted his message. He clarified, &quot;The &#x27;appropriate&#x27; use of time-outs calls for brief, infrequent, previously explained breaks from an interaction used as part of a thought-out parenting strategy that is followed by positive feedback and connection with a parent. This seems not only reasonable, but it is an overall approach supported by the research as helpful for many children.&quot;

New &quot;strong&quot; positive parenting approaches suggest avoiding punishment in general, including time-outs. Advocates of strong positive parenting argue that children&#x27;s misbehavior may be due to underlying issues rather than simple defiance, and punishing these behaviors will only lead to avoidance without fixing the underlying issue.

The Australian Association for Infant Mental Health has published a position statement in which the use of time-out is considered inappropriate for children under three years of age, and &quot;needs to be carefully considered in relation to the individual child’s experience and needs&quot; for children past this age. They suggest the use of &quot;time-in&quot; instead, where children are taken away from the situation but not excluded from parent interaction.

The use of time-out needs to be carefully considered in families dealing with special challenges. In a review of parenting intervention programs for drug-abusing mothers, researchers found that programs emphasizing behavioral approaches to discipline (such as the use of time-out and rewards) &quot;were not successful in fostering measurable improvement in mother-child interactions or promoting child development.&quot; An attachment-based approach focusing on strengthening the parent/child relationship was found to be more successful than behavioral approaches in changing children&#x27;s behavior in these families.

Other studies have found that the traditional behavioral approach to discipline (such as the use of time-out and rewards) can be challenging with children in foster care with attachment disorders resulting from early abuse or neglect. Foster parents benefit from training that addresses these children&#x27;s attachment and emotional issues, as well as traditional parenting techniques.

Time-out has been misused to the point of becoming abusive in some schools and so proper training for educational professionals is important. There are reported cases of children being locked in closets for extended periods of solitary confinement for behaviors such as crying or failing to finish an assignment. These are not examples of appropriate use of time-out.

<text>Andrew Bobola, SJ (; 1591 – 16 May 1657) was a Polish missionary and martyr of the Society of Jesus, known as the Apostle of Lithuania and the &quot;hunter of souls&quot;. He was beaten and tortured to death during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. He was canonized in 1938 by Pope Pius XI.

==Life==
Bobola was born in 1591 into a noble family in the Sandomir Palatinate in the Province of Lesser Poland of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, then a constituent part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1611 he entered the Society of Jesus in Vilnius, then in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the other part of the Commonwealth. He subsequently professed solemn vows and was ordained in 1622, after which he served for several years as an advisor, preacher, superior of a Jesuit residence, and other jobs in various places.

From 1652 Bobola also worked as a country &quot;missionary&quot;, in various locations of Lithuania: these included Polotsk, where he was probably stationed in 1655, and also Pinsk, (both now in Belarus). On 16 May 1657, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, he was captured in Pinsk, and then killed in the village of Janów (now Ivanava, Belarus), by the Cossacks of Bohdan Chmielnicki.

Several descriptions of Bobola&#x27;s death exist, with these invariably involving him being subjected to a variety of tortures before being killed:
*One account states that Bobola &quot;had just offered up the holy sacrifice&quot; when the Cossacks entered Pinsk; upon seeing them, he believed his death to be imminent and thus &quot;fell upon his knees, raised his eyes and his hands [and] exclaimed, &#x27;Lord, thy will be done!&#x27;&quot;. He was then captured and stripped of his habit, tied to a tree, and had a crown placed on his head, after which he was scourged, burnt with torches, and had an eye torn out; a sword was used to carve shapes resembling a tonsure and a chasuble into his head and his back respectively. The Cossacks also removed the skin from his fingers and forcibly inserted needles under his fingernails. Bobola continuously prayed for his torturers until his tongue was torn out and his head crushed, thereby killing him.
*A second account states that the Cossacks first tried to make Bobola renounce his religion; when he refused, he was stripped, tied to a hedge, and whipped. A crown of twigs was mockingly placed on his head and he was then dragged to a butcher&#x27;s shop where, after continued refusals to renounce his faith, the skin was torn off his chest and back and holes were cut into his palms. Bobola was subjected to further tortures for two hours before having an awl driven into his heart, being strung up by his feet, and being killed with a sabre just as a Polish rescue party entered Janów.
*A third account states that Bobola was seized and severely beaten by two Cossacks who then tied him to their saddles in order to take him to Janów; there, he was subjected to tortures including burning, strangulation, and flaying, before finally being killed with a sabre.
In contrast to the above, a Russian examination of Bobola&#x27;s corpse in January 1923 found no traces of gross mechanical violence on the surviving parts of the corpse that could establish cause of death.

==Veneration==

Bobola&#x27;s body was originally buried in the Jesuit church in Pinsk. It was later moved to their church in Polotsk. By the beginning of the 18th century, however, nobody knew where Bobola&#x27;s body was buried. In 1701 Father Martin Godebski, S.J., the rector of the Pinsk College, reputedly had a vision of Bobola. This caused him to order a search for the body. It was reportedly found completely incorrupt, which is recognized by the Church and its supporters as evidence of holiness. 
On 23 June 1922, the coffin with the relics of Andrew Bobola was opened in Polotsk and an examination was carried out. In December 1922, the coffin with the corpse of Andrew Bobola was delivered to Moscow and placed in the hall of the Popular Exhibition on Health Protection of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Health. In January 1923, he was examined by a special commission and an act was drawn up, according to which the corpse of Andrew Bobola is a naturally mummified corpse, which is in the stage of slow decomposition. The results of the examinations were published in 1924 in the journal . Later described by an American journalist as a &quot;remarkably well-preserved mummy&quot;, to the Museum of Hygiene of People&#x27;s Commissioners of Health in Moscow. The whereabouts of the remains were not known to the Catholic authorities, and Pope Pius XI charged the Papal Famine Relief Mission in Russia, headed by American Jesuit Father Edmund A. Walsh, with the task of locating and &quot;rescuing&quot; them. In October 1923—as a kind of &quot;pay&quot; for help during famine—the remains were released to Walsh and his assistant director, Father Louis J. Gallagher, S.J. Well-packed by the two Jesuits, they were delivered to the Holy See by Gallagher on All Saints&#x27; Day (1 November) 1923. In May 1924, the relics were installed in Rome&#x27;s Church of the Gesù, the main church of the Society of Jesus.

Since 19 June 1938 the body has been venerated at a shrine in Warsaw, with an arm remaining at the original shrine in Rome (see photo at left).

Declared blessed by Pope Pius IX on 30 October 1853, Bobola was canonized by Pope Pius XI on 17 April 1938. His feast day was originally celebrated by the Jesuits on 23 May, but it is now generally celebrated on 16 May. In 2002, the Bishops&#x27; Conference of Poland declared Bobola a patron saint of Poland.
