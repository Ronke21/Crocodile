<text>Wolin (; ) is a Polish island in the Baltic Sea, just off the Polish coast. Administratively, the island belongs to the West Pomeranian Voivodeship. Wolin is separated from the island of Usedom (Uznam) by the Strait of Świna, and from mainland Pomerania by the Strait of Dziwna. The island has an area of and its highest point is Mount Grzywacz at 116 m above sea level. The number of inhabitants is 30,000. Eastern suburbs of the city of Świnoujście extend to the Wolin island, while the towns of Międzyzdroje and Wolin lie further east.

Water from the river Oder flows into the Szczecin Lagoon and from there through the Peene west of Usedom, Świna and Dziwna into the Bay of Pomerania in the Baltic Sea.

Most of the island consists of forests and postglacial hills. In the middle is the Wolin National Park. The island is the main tourist attraction of northwestern Poland, and it is crossed by several marked tourist trails, such as a trail from Międzyzdroje to Dziwnówek. There is a main, electrified rail line, which connects Szczecin and Świnoujście, as well as the international road E65 (national road 3 / S3 expressway) crossing the island.

Some etymologists believe that the name is related to the name of the ancient historical region of Volhynia. The origins of the name then would come from the resettled Volynians who named the island Volyn.

== History ==
The ford across the river Dziwna on which Wolin is located has been used as far back as the Stone Age. Archaeological excavations of soil layers indicate that there was a settlement in the area during the Migration period, at the turn of the 5th and 6th centuries. The place was then abandoned for approximately one hundred years. At the end of the 8th or the beginning of the 9th century, the area was levelled and a new settlement constructed. The earliest evidence of fortifications dates to the first half of the 9th century. In the second half of the 9th century, there was a central fortified area and two suburbs, to the north and south of the center. These became enclosed and fortified between the end of the 9th and the 10th centuries.

A medieval document from the mid-9th century, called the &quot;Bavarian Geographer&quot; after its anonymous creator, mentions the Slavic tribe of Wolinians who had 70 strongholds at that time (&quot;Uelunzani civitates LXX&quot;). The town of Wolin was first mentioned in 965, by Ibrahim ibn Jakub, who referred to the place as &quot;Weltaba&quot;.

The period of greatest development during the medieval period was between the 9th and the 11th centuries. Around 896 AD a new port was constructed and the main part of the town acquired new, stronger fortifications, including a wooden palisade made of halved 50-centimetre wide tree trunks, a rampart and a retaining wall.

Archaeologists believe that in the Early Middle Ages Wolin was a great trade emporium, spreading along the shore for four kilometres and rivalling in importance Birka and Hedeby.
In 967, the island became controlled by Poland, under the country&#x27;s first historic ruler, Duke Mieszko I. However, it has not been established if Wolin became directly part of Poland, or if it was a fief. Mieszko I encompassed the town of Wolin with defensive ramparts. Polish influences were not firm and they ended around 1007. In the following years, Wolin became famous for its pirates, who would plunder ships cruising the Baltic. As a reprisal, in 1043 it was attacked by the Norwegian king Magnus the Good.

In the early 12th century, the island, as part of the Pomeranian duchy, was captured by the Polish monarch Boleslaw III Wrymouth. Shortly after, the inhabitants of Wolin accepted Christianity, and in 1140 pope Innocent II created a diocese there, with its capital in the town of Wolin. In 1170, the battle at Julin Bridge took place there. In 1185 the dukes of Pomerania became vassals of Denmark, and in 1227, they fell under suzerainty of the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1535, Wolin accepted Protestant Lutheranism. In 1630, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the island was captured by Sweden. It passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1720 as a result of the Treaty of Stockholm. From 1871, the island was part of the German Empire. During World War II, in February 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Allied prisoners-of-war from the Stalag XX-B POW camp passed through the island. After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, it became again part of Poland.

In 1949–1950, a military hospital was based on the island, in which some 2,000 wounded or ill Greeks and Macedonians, partisans and refugees of the Greek Civil War, were treated by the Poles.

In 2015, the Świnoujście LNG terminal was opened.

=== Connection with Jomsborg and Vineta ===
Archaeological finds on the island are not very rich but they dot an area of 20 hectares, making it the second largest Baltic marketplace of the Viking Age after Hedeby. Some scholars have speculated that Wolin may have been the basis for the semi-legendary settlements Jomsborg and Vineta. However, others have rejected the identification, or even the historical existence of Jomsborg and Vineta (for example, Gerard Labuda).

Gwyn Jones notes that the size of the town was exaggerated in contemporary sources, for example by Adam of Bremen who claimed Wolin/Jomsborg was &quot;the largest town in Europe&quot;. Archaeological excavations, however, have found no evidence of a harbor big enough for 360 warships (as claimed by Adam) or of a major citadel. The town was inhabited by both Slavs and Scandinavians.
A golden disc bearing the name of Harald Bluetooth and Jomsborg appeared in Sweden in autumn 2014. The disc, also called the Curmsun Disc, is made of high gold content and has a weight of 25,23 gram. On the obverse there is a Latin inscription and on the reverse there is a Latin cross with four dots surrounded by an octagonal ridge. The inscription reads: &quot;+ARALD CVRMSVN+REX AD TANER+SCON+JVMN+CIV ALDIN+&quot; and translates as &quot;Harald Gormsson king of Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, town Aldinburg&quot;.

It is assumed that the disc was a part of a Viking hoard found in 1840 in the Polish village Wiejkowo near the town of Wolin by Heinrich Boldt, the maternal great-great-grandfather of Hollywood actors and producers Ben Affleck and Casey Affleck.

The disc was rediscovered in 2014 by an eleven year old schoolgirl who found it in an old casket and then brought it to school.

<text>Kültepe (Turkish: ), also known under its ancient name Kaneš (Kanesh, sometimes also Kaniš/Kanish) or Neša (Nesha), is an archaeological site in Kayseri Province, Turkey. It was already a major settlement at the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC (Early Bronze Age), but it is world-renowned for its significance at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC (Middle Bronze Age). The archaeological site consists of a large mound (also known as höyük, tepe or tell), and a lower city, where a &quot;kārum&quot; (the Assyrian word for trading district) was established in the beginning of the 2nd Millenium BC. So far, 23,500 cuneiform tablets recovered from private houses constitute the largest collection of private texts in the ancient Near East. In 2014, the archaeological site was inscribed in the Tentative list of World Heritage Sites in Turkey.

==History==

Kültepe is located about 20 km northeast from the modern city Kayseri. Its ancient name is recorded in Assyrian and Hittite sources. In Assyrian inscriptions from the 20th and the 19th century BC, the city was mentioned as Kaneš (also transcribed as Kanesh); in later Hittite inscriptions, the city was mentioned as Neša (sometimes transcribed as Nesha, Nessa or Nesa. Neša derives from [Ka]neša). 

The site is divided into two main areas: the circular mound (tepe, höyük) and the lower town to its northeast. The mound was inhabited (with discontinuity) from the Early Bronze Age through the Roman Empire, while the lower town was occupied only from the last decades of the third millennium to the early sixteenth century BCE. The lower town displays four levels of occupation, with only levels II (approximately 1945–1835 BCE) and Ib (approximately 1832–1700 BCE)—which roughly correspond to the Middle Bronze Age—yielding significant written records, totaling around 22,200 and 560 tablets, respectively. In contrast, only forty scattered tablets were found on the mound, where palaces and temples were uncovered, indicating that there are no surviving archives from the local authorities, if such archives ever existed. This &quot;kārum&quot; appears to have served as &quot;the administrative and distribution centre of the entire Assyrian colony network in Anatolia&quot;. A late record, from circa 1400 BC, recounts the story of a king of Kaneš called Zipani, with seventeen local city-kings who rose up against Naram-Sin of Akkad, who ruled circa 2254–2218 BC.

During the &quot;kārum&quot; period, and before the conquest of Pitḫana, these local kings reigned in Kaneš: 
*Ḫurmili (before 1790 BC)
*Paḫanu (a short time in 1790 BC)
*Inar (c. 1790–1775 BC), then
*Waršama (c. 1775–1750 BC).

The king of Zalpuwa, Uḫna, raided Kaneš, after which the Zalpuwans carried off the city&#x27;s &quot;Šiuš&quot; idol. Pitḫana, the king of Kuššara, conquered Neša &quot;in the night, by force&quot;, but &quot;did not do evil to anyone in it&quot;. Neša revolted against the rule of Pitḫana&#x27;s son, Anitta, but Anitta quashed the revolt and made Neša his capital. Anitta further invaded Zalpuwa, captured its king Huzziya, and recovered the &quot;Šiuš&quot; idol for Neša.

In the 17th century BC, Anitta&#x27;s descendants moved their capital to Hattusa, which Anitta had cursed, thus founding the line of Hittite kings. The inhabitants thus referred to the Hittite language as &quot;Nešili&quot; &#x27;the Neša tongue&#x27;.

== Archaeology ==
 


By 1880, cuneiform tablets said to be from &quot;Kara Eyuk&quot; (&#x27;black village&#x27;) or &quot;Gyul Tepé&quot; (&#x27;burnt mound&#x27;) near &quot;Kaisariyeh&quot;, had begun to appear on the market, some being thus bought by the British Museum. In response the site was worked by Ernest Chantre for two seasons, beginning in 1893.
Hugo Grothe dug a small soundage in 1906.
In 1925, Bedřich Hrozný excavated Kültepe and found over 1000 cuneiform tablets, some of which ended up in Prague and in Istanbul. In 1929 the site was visited
and photographed by James Henry Breasted of the Oriental Institute of Chicago. There had been much digging for fertilizer, which had destroyed a quarter of the mound.

Modern archaeological work began in 1948, when Kültepe was excavated by a team from the Turkish Historical Society and the General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums. The team was led by Tahsin Özgüç until his death, in 2005. After 2005 the excavation was directed by Fikri Kulakoğlu.

* Level IV–III. Little excavation has been done for these levels, which represent the &quot;kārum&#x27;s&quot; first habitation. No writing is attested, and archaeologists assume that both levels&#x27; inhabitants were illiterate.
* Level II, 1974–1836 BC (Mesopotamian middle chronology according to Veenhof). Craftsmen of this time and place specialised in animal-shaped earthen drinking vessels, which were often used for religious rituals. Assyrian merchants then established the &quot;kārum&quot; of the city: &quot;Kaneš&quot;. Bullae of Naram-Sin of Eshnunna have been found toward the end of this level, which was burned to the ground.
* Level Ib, 1798–1740 BC. After an abandoned period, the city was rebuilt over the ruins of the old and again became a prosperous trade center. The trade was under the control of Ishme-Dagan I, who was put in control of Assur when his father, Shamshi-Adad I, conquered Ekallatum and Assur. However, the colony was again destroyed by fire. During excavations in 2001 140 cuneiform tablets were found in this level of the karum including a new rendition of the Kültepe eponym list.
* Level Ia. The city was reinhabited, but the Assyrian colony was no longer inhabited. The culture was early Hittite. Its name in Hittite acquired an extra sound as &quot;Kaneša&quot;, which was more commonly contracted to &quot;Neša&quot;.

Some attribute Level II&#x27;s burning to the conquest of the city of Assur by the kings of Eshnunna, but Bryce blames it on the raid of Uhna. Some attribute Level Ib&#x27;s burning to the fall of Assur, other nearby kings and eventually to Hammurabi of Babylon.

To date, over 22,000 cuneiform tablets have been recovered from the site, mainly from the &quot;kārum&quot;, with only 40 found in the Upper city.

Subsequent excavations attested the following stratigraphy of Kültepe:

Recently, in &quot;a small cell-plan structure cutting the walls of the monumental building [o]f Kültepe [Level 13], dated to the second half of the 3rd Millennium BC, statuettes made of alabaster with various attributes and ritual vessels in unprecedented forms were found in situ,&quot; and inside a &quot;monumental building [d]iscovered in 2018 [which] contains a room called the &#x27;idol room,&#x27; [a] collection of the largest number of idols and statuettes ever discovered in the ancient Near East [was found].&quot;

=== &quot;Kārum&quot; Kaneš ===
The quarter of the city that most interests historians is the &quot;kārum&quot;, a portion of the city that was set aside by local officials for the early Assyrian merchants to use without paying taxes as long as the goods remained inside the &quot;kārum&quot;. The term &quot;kārum&quot; means &quot;port&quot; in Akkadian, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the time, but its meaning was later extended to refer to any trading colony whether or not it bordered water.

Several other cities in Anatolia also had a &quot;kārum&quot;, but the largest was Kaneš, whose important &quot;kārum&quot; was inhabited by soldiers and merchants from Assyria for hundreds of years. They traded local tin and wool for luxury items, foodstuffs, spices and woven fabrics from the Assyrian homeland and Elam.

The remains of the &quot;kārum&quot; form a large circular mound 500 m in diameter and about 20 m above the plain (a tell). The &quot;kārum&quot; settlement is the result of several superimposed stratigraphic periods. New buildings were constructed on top of the remains of the earlier periods so there is a deep stratigraphy from prehistoric times to the early Hittite period.

The &quot;kārum&quot; was destroyed by fire at the end of levels II and Ib. The inhabitants left most of their possessions behind, as found by modern archaeologists.

The findings have included numerous baked-clay tablets, some of which were enclosed in clay envelopes stamped with cylinder seals. The documents record common activities, such as trade between the Assyrian colony and the city-state of Assur and between Assyrian merchants and local people. The trade was run by families rather than the state. The Kültepe texts are the oldest documents from Anatolia. Although they are written in Old Assyrian, the Hittite loanwords and names in the texts are the oldest record of any Indo-European language Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but the use of both cuneiform and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.

=== Dating of Waršama Sarayi ===
At Level II, the destruction was so total that no wood survived for dendrochronological studies. In 2003, researchers from Cornell University dated wood in level Ib from the rest of the city, built centuries earlier. The dendrochronologists date the bulk of the wood from buildings of the Waršama Sarayi to 1832 BC, with further refurbishments up to 1779 BC.
In 2016 new research using radiocarbon dating and dendrology on timber used in this site and the palace in Acemhöyük show the likely earliest use of the palace as not before 1851–1842 BC (68.2% hpd) or 1855–1839 BC (95.4% hpd). In combination with the many Assyrian objects found here, this dating shows that only middle or low-middle chronology are the only remaining possible chronologies that fit these new data.

<doc id="54503" wikidata="Q1661036" url="?curid=54503" title="Incubus (band)">
<text>Incubus is an American rock band from Calabasas, California. The band was formed in 1991 by vocalist Brandon Boyd, lead guitarist Mike Einziger, and drummer José Pasillas while enrolled in Calabasas High School and later expanded to include bassist Alex &quot;Dirk Lance&quot; Katunich, and Gavin &quot;DJ Lyfe&quot; Koppel; the latter two were eventually replaced by bassist Ben Kenney and DJ Kilmore, respectively. Nicole Row replaced Kenney in 2024.

Incubus has attained commercial success, reaching multi-platinum sales, as well as releasing several successful singles. After their first two albums, &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; (1995) and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; (1997), the band earned mainstream recognition with the release of their 1999 album &quot;Make Yourself&quot; which spawned several hits, including the band&#x27;s highest charting song &quot;Drive&quot;. Success continued with the albums &quot;Morning View&quot; (2001) and &quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot; (2004). Their sixth studio album, &quot;Light Grenades&quot;, debuted at No. 1 in 2006 and was followed by Incubus&#x27;s first greatest hits album &quot;Monuments and Melodies&quot; in June 2009 and the band&#x27;s 2011 album, &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot;. Incubus also released an EP, &quot;Trust Fall (Side A)&quot;, in early 2015, and two years later, the band released their eighth studio album, titled &quot;8&quot;, on April 21, 2017. A second EP, &quot;Trust Fall (Side B)&quot;, was released on April 17, 2020. As of October 2022, Incubus has generated 12.4 million U.S. album consumption units and over 23 million records worldwide.

==History==
===Formation, &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; and &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; (1991–1996)===

Incubus was formed in 1991 by vocalist Brandon Boyd, guitarist Mike Einziger, bassist Alex Katunich and drummer José Pasillas, while the members were in high school. They existed as a band for some time before they gave themselves a name, having only chosen the band&#x27;s name &quot;Incubus&quot; when required to supply a band name for an upcoming show. The band&#x27;s early shows were frequently at nightclubs on Los Angeles&#x27;s Sunset Strip, including such well-known venues as the Whisky a Go Go, the Roxy and the Troubadour. Early on the members of Incubus bonded over Phish and Primus and used their grassroots approach as a model for their career.

Incubus produced many of their early recordings with Jim Wirt and Chillum Records in the Santa Monica studio 4th Street Recording, only able to work on their music during hours in which they were not in school. In 1995, they recorded their first two-song EP, &quot;Let Me Tell Ya &#x27;Bout Root Beer&quot;. This was followed by the debut album &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;, also recorded with Wirt and released on Incubus&#x27;s own label &quot;Stopuglynailfungus Music&quot;. Incubus then added Gavin Koppel (known by his stage name DJ Lyfe) to the band. In the following year, Incubus signed a seven-record deal with Sony&#x27;s Immortal Records, later to become Epic Records. The group was spotted by Epic/Immortal A&amp;R Paul Pontius, who was also responsible for signing Korn to the label. The 1997 six-track EP &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; was the band&#x27;s first major-label release and was created so the band could present a recording while touring with Korn in Europe.

===&quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; (1997–1998)===
&quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;, Incubus&#x27;s second studio album, was released on September 9, 1997. After their album release, they started opening for bands such as Korn and 311. This album marked a stylistic departure from the band&#x27;s early material, featuring heavy guitar riffs, slap bass and turntables to create their most nu metal album. In February 1998, Incubus dismissed Koppel (DJ Lyfe). A friend recommended Chris Kilmore (DJ Kilmore) to fill the position. The band enjoyed Kilmore&#x27;s style and attitude towards life and asked him to join the band. Incubus participated in the Ozzfest and Family Values metal festivals and toured with System of a Down and Ultraspank during the fall.

===&quot;Make Yourself&quot; (1999–2000)===
After constant touring throughout 1998, and after selling over 100,000 copies of &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; without the support of radio or television exposure, Incubus took a break for two years and then began working on their third album &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. After just two weeks in the studio with producer Jim Wirt, the band was unhappy with the recordings and opted to continue recording without a producer. After another three weeks of recording, R.E.M./Nirvana producer Scott Litt took an interest in their songs and started taking part in the recording sessions, mainly focusing on songs like &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;Stellar&quot;. According to the band, Litt&#x27;s involvement in the record came mostly during the mixing process.

&quot;Make Yourself&quot; was released on October 26, 1999. The album marked the beginning of a more commercially acceptable pop rock and alternative rock sound for the band, although several songs from the album still included elements of nu/alternative metal, such as downtuned riffs and layers of electronics. Right after their album&#x27;s release, the band went on tour with Primus and Buckethead, a tour which lasted for the remainder of the year. The first song that kicked off the album, &quot;Privilege&quot;, was featured on &quot;MTV Sports: Pure Ride&quot; for the PlayStation. The band also released the single, &quot;Pardon Me&quot;, but it was initially not well received by radio stations. Brandon and Mike decided to perform a live acoustic version of the song at the few radio stations who were showing interest, and this in turn spread the word of the song. Many radio stations began to play the acoustic version, including the influential Los Angeles radio giant KROQ-FM.
With sparked interest in the song, radio stations began playing the studio version of &quot;Pardon Me&quot;. In response, Incubus made a video for the song and released a six-song EP titled &quot;When Incubus Attacks (Vol. 1)&quot; on August 22, 2000. The EP contained the acoustic version of &quot;Pardon Me&quot;. In its first week, the EP sold nearly 40,000 copies, and peaked at No. 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. To start off 2000, the band headed out on Tour with System of a Down, and Mr. Bungle until March, at which point they embarked on a headline tour in clubs until April.

Due to the success of &quot;Pardon Me&quot;, &quot;Make Yourself&quot; reached Gold certification (500,000 copies sold) in April 2000. Incubus continued to tour overseas, and returned home at the end of May to go on a tour of the United States with longtime friends 311. &quot;Stellar&quot;, the next single from the album was soon released, and its video received afternoon airplay on MTV and &quot;TRL&quot;, becoming a success on the Alternative chart. In July, Incubus were once again on the Ozzfest bill, until the late summer.

The band then took a short break after finishing the Ozzfest 2000 Tour, playing two acoustic shows at Artist Direct Studios. On October 5, 2000, &quot;Make Yourself&quot; went Platinum (one million copies sold), and shortly after, the band went on tour with Deftones. Sony re-released their independent debut album &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; on November 7, 2000.

On November 14, 2000, the band released &quot;Drive&quot;, the third single from &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. It moved quickly up to the top of the Alternative Charts, eventually hitting the No. 1 spot. The single was a success and helped the band break into the mainstream. The single eventually reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart.

After a ten-year break from the music business in 2000, thrash metal band Opprobrium (formed in 1986 under the name Incubus) were forced to change their name in order to avoid confusion and a lawsuit.

===&quot;Morning View&quot; (2001–2002)===
The band took a break during the first part of 2001 before heading to a beachside mansion in Malibu, California, to record their follow-up album, which would later become known as &quot;Morning View&quot;.

They began touring once more with Hundred Reasons in Europe from June until the first week of July. At this time, the band was invited to play with the Area 1 Festival, which featured Moby, Outkast, the Roots, Paul Oakenfold, Carl Cox, and Nelly Furtado. Also, in July, &quot;Make Yourself&quot; was certified double-platinum, selling 2 million copies. In August, the band got to play their first shows in Australia and Japan, before returning to the United States to begin their headlining tour with their long-time friends from California, Hoobastank. Meanwhile, the band&#x27;s video for &quot;Drive&quot; was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the category of Best Group Video.

Continuing to tour, Incubus released their first single, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, from their upcoming record, &quot;Morning View&quot;, on August 21, 2001. The single instantly began to climb up the Alternative charts, reaching No. 2 by early September. The music video was released at the end of that month, after being re-cut to make it more viewable in the wake of the 9/11 disaster. The video earned viewings on MTV&#x27;s TRL, VH1, and MuchMusic. Their follow-up single was &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;.

On October 23, 2001, the band released their fourth full-length major label album. The name was taken from the street on which the band&#x27;s recording studio was situated. Incubus continued to headline dates after its release, and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; continued to sit among the top 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Alternative charts. &quot;Morning View&quot; debuted on the Billboard Top 200 at the No. 2 spot (266,000 copies were sold in its first week). This was the highest ever placement for Incubus. At the same time, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was at No. 2 on the Alternative Charts, and &quot;Drive&quot; sat at No. 48 on the Hot 100 chart. The band won an award for Billboard&#x27;s Alternative Single of the Year for &quot;Drive&quot;. By December, &quot;Morning View&quot; was certified platinum, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; was No. 4 on Alternative charts, and &quot;Morning View&quot; was No. 38 on top 200.

On December 11, Incubus released &quot;When Incubus Attacks (Vol. 2)&quot;, a DVD-Video that featured music videos for &quot;Take Me to Your Leader&quot;, &quot;A Certain Shade of Green&quot;, &quot;Pardon Me&quot;, &quot;Stellar&quot;, &quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;I Miss You&quot;, and &quot;Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)&quot;, live footage, backstage video, and more. Director Bill Draheim documented the making of &quot;Drive&quot;. Save Me from my Half-Life Drive is the result of that edited EPK footage.

To begin 2002, Incubus was No. 9 with &quot;Drive&quot;, No. 12 with &quot;Stellar&quot;, No. 20 with &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, No. 75 with &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; and No. 31 with the album &quot;Morning View&quot;. On January 24, 2002, MTV&#x27;s TRL premiered the &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; video, and Boyd called in from Europe where the band was on tour with 311 and Hoobastank. The band was then featured on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Becoming&quot;, TRL, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and played the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on February 14, 2002, all before heading off to play dates in Japan and Australia for the remainder of February and March. While in Sydney, the band shot the video for their next single, &quot;Warning&quot;, from March 7 until March 11.
The band then released the DVD &quot;The Morning View Sessions&quot; on May 28, shortly before playing the Weenie Roast on June 8 for KROQ.

Incubus issued a limited-edition version of &quot;Morning View&quot; on October 1 to coincide with their fall headlining tour. The new version of the album contained a DVD dubbed the &quot;Morning After View Session&quot;. It featured the UK video for the group&#x27;s track &quot;Are You In?&quot;, tour footage, new artwork, behind-the-scenes material, and more. Incubus&#x27;s last performance in 2002 (on November 1) brought several eras for the band to a close. Their last show of the tour would be their last show touring behind 2001&#x27;s &quot;Morning View&quot;, as the band looked on to playing new music. The show would also prove to be their last with bass player Dirk Lance, who left the band due to personal differences.

Lance was quietly replaced by former the Roots guitarist Ben Kenney, who began working with Einziger on new songs for a psychedelic jazz-funk project called Time-Lapse Consortium. Incubus ended the year on the charts, having &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (No. 10), &quot;Warning&quot; (No. 16), and &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; (No. 26) on the alternative rock format chart, joining &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (No. 25) and &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; (No. 36). &quot;Morning View&quot; was the 40th-best-selling album of 2002.

===&quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot; (2003–2004)===

On January 6, 2003, the band began writing for their next record. The next month, on February 7, the band began to renegotiate their record contract. The band, which had been signed to Epic/Immortal for seven years, cited the fact that state law limits the amount of time that an artist can be bound to a company. The band had been signed to the label for 7 years, and used California&#x27;s de Havilland Law as a negotiating tool with Epic/Immortal. After releasing three successful albums, the band had been compensated poorly compared to the revenue that they had generated for Sony. The band entered a lawsuit against their label in order to break from their contract, to which Sony responded with a lawsuit of their own. On March 1, Einziger, along with Scott Litt, Dave Holdredge, and Rick Will, was nominated for a Grammy in the &quot;Best Engineered Album (Non Classical)&quot; category, for their work on &quot;Morning View&quot;. On April 3, after weeks of circulating rumors about Dirk Lance&#x27;s departure from the band, an official announcement was made by the band. A decision had been reached amongst members of Incubus in a face-to-face meeting at the end of the &quot;Morning View&quot; tour to discuss his involvement in the band. The band said that the split had become necessary due to &quot;irreconcilable creative differences&quot;.
Almost immediately after the announcement of a new bass player, the 2003 Incubus vs. Sony case had been settled. The two sides settled on a new contract that delivers three albums to Epic/Immortal with an option on a fourth. The first album would be worth $8 million in advances to the band, with another $2.5 million for each one thereafter.
By December the new album, which was recorded at Southern Tracks Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia was recorded live, opposed to recording each instrument at separate times, and was produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien (Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, Stone Temple Pilots) was completed and scheduled for release. Titled &quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot;, the album was to be an enhanced CD with behind-the-scenes video. In the videos, Einziger and Boyd discussed their new songs. Einziger described them as &quot;like the old shit, but older. It&#x27;s very different. It&#x27;s very energetic and fast, and a lot of it is more technical. I guess maybe in the vein of more of our older songs; they don&#x27;t sound like our older songs. They are more exploratory.&quot; It was the last Incubus album to be labelled as &quot;alternative metal&quot; by the media, with subsequent albums from the band diverting even further from this sound. On December 15, 2003, the first single, &quot;Megalomaniac&quot;, was released. It raised controversy when it was said to be an attack on the Bush administration, and was banned from daytime view on MTV (despite the band saying that it was not an attack on a particular person, rather a comment on some people&#x27;s negative attitudes). However, the band was actually pleased with this nighttime viewing restriction. Says Boyd, &quot;When we heard our video had been relegated to late night rotation, I think that all of us were secretly like, &#x27;Yes!&#x27; &quot;. Pasillas reflected Boyd&#x27;s sentiments, saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s okay if people think that we&#x27;re trying to make a political statement. Whatever anyone conjures up or takes from our music is good; I mean, our point is to get people thinking.&quot;

&quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot; was released in 2004, showcasing a new turn for the band. The second single released was &quot;Talk Shows on Mute&quot;, featuring a video that was inspired by George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot;.

Incubus toured worldwide in 2004 with many bands, including Ben Kweller, the Walkmen, Hundred Reasons, the Music, Brand New and Sparta, to promote their new album after their original support act the Vines pulled out due to exhaustion. One song left off the album, the 27-minute-long instrumental entitled &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, was later featured on soundtrack for the video game, &quot;Halo 2&quot;.

In November 2004, the band released a live DVD entitled &quot;Alive at Red Rocks&quot;, filmed in Red Rocks Park, Colorado, during their world tour for &quot;A Crow Left of the Murder...&quot;. Along with the DVD came a bonus CD featuring five tracks, including a studio version of live favorite &quot;Pantomime&quot;, &quot;Follow&quot; (a lyrical version, different from the First Movement of the Odyssey version), and the UK B-side &quot;Monuments and Melodies&quot;. Two live tracks were also included. The performance was also sold in high definition via Blu-ray Disc. A high definition version of the entire song &quot;Pardon Me&quot; is also available for free download from the PlayStation Store, an online service for PlayStation 3 users.

In December 2004, at a gig in Los Angeles the band played the Police hits &quot;De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da&quot;, &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;Roxanne&quot; with Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers from the former band.

===&quot;Light Grenades&quot; (2005–2008)===

In the spring of 2005, the band went back into the studio with Brendan O&#x27;Brien. Three new songs were released in late July 2005 as part of the soundtrack album to the Sony film &quot;Stealth&quot;. The track &quot;&quot;Make a Move&quot;&quot;, was released to radio in late May, and song reached No. 17 (Alternative Charts) and No. 19 (Mainstream Rock Charts). Fan reaction towards &quot;Make a Move&quot; was lukewarm, but the other two new songs, &quot;Admiration&quot; and &quot;Neither of Us Can See&quot; (a duet with Chrissie Hynde), seemed to be much more well-liked. In January 2006, the first of a series of Incubus podcasts was released by the band via internet. Among other things, the podcast featured the band&#x27;s thoughts about their 2005 South American tour, some information on their new album, a mash-up of &quot;Drive&quot; and Tupac Shakur&#x27;s &quot;Better Dayz&quot;, a cover of Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot;, and a few live interludes.

On August 1, 2006, the band announced that album number six, &quot;Light Grenades&quot;, was soon to be released and that it was being produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien. A few weeks afterward, the release date was confirmed to be Tuesday, November 28. Upon release, &quot;Light Grenades&quot; debuted No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the first time Incubus has ever sat atop the album charts, despite only selling 165,000 copies (their lowest debut for an album since &quot;Make Yourself&quot;) in the first week.

In November, Incubus played two exclusive European shows in Berlin and London. These were both in less than 2,000-capacity venues—a special occasion for the band and the fans (due to Incubus&#x27;s mainstream success, the band now usually plays at large arenas worldwide). The band used these shows to showcase new material from &quot;Light Grenades&quot;. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Anna Molly&quot;, had a music video which had mainstream success.

On December 27, 2006, Incubus launched the &quot;I Dig Incubus&quot; contest, in which participants cut together clips of the band performing their single &quot;Dig&quot;, to form a complete music video. On February 1, 2007, five finalists were announced for the &quot;I Dig Incubus&quot; contest. In a video interview on &quot;Blender&quot;, bassist and vocalist Ben Kenney said, &quot;It&#x27;s almost something that will happen whether or not we want to do it. People will make their own videos for songs. It&#x27;s kind of a cool way for us to get together with fans out there who are artistic.&quot; On August 4, 2007, Incubus played on the first day at Baltimore&#x27;s Virgin Festival along with bands such as the Police and Beastie Boys.

Michael Einziger had been suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome and although he had an operation that has corrected the problem, he needed to recuperate for a few months, hence recent tour plans were postponed. Incubus apologized to fans and continued the tour in the summer and autumn.

In February and March 2008, Incubus hit the road again starting in New Zealand and headlining the Soundwave festival in Australia alongside the Offspring and Alexisonfire, and toured Asia performing to sell-out crowds. In Singapore, they met fans at a Meet and Greet session at Changi Airport and performed at Fort Canning Hill.
In April, Incubus performed at the Festival Imperial in Costa Rica, along with the bands the Smashing Pumpkins and Duran Duran, and later in Venezuela at the Poliedro de Caracas.
Incubus also performed a number of shows throughout Europe this summer including the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park Festivals in Germany, the Nova Rock Festival in Austria, Pinkpop Festival in the Netherlands and the Download Festival in England. In July 2008, the band played in a VH1 tribute to the Who alongside Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam and the Flaming Lips.

===Hiatus and greatest hits album (2009–2010)===
In April 2008 the band took a break from touring and recording while its members concentrated on school, family and other activities. Brandon Boyd enrolled in a university art program in Los Angeles, while guitarist Mike Einziger went to Harvard music school to study composition. Drummer José Pasillas was also &quot;having a baby, so there&#x27;s a lot of normal life stuff going on right now—school, babies, mortgages,&quot; Boyd said. &quot;I&#x27;m of the mind to say it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad thing to disappear for a year or two years,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of people would say culture moves too fast and you need to remind people, but I would argue there&#x27;s not any rush.&quot;

In mid January 2009, Incubus posted a video to their official site, describing what each band member was occupied with in the form of letters to each other. The resolution of the video was that the band was planning on getting back together soon, excited to create new music with their diverse experiences over their respite.

On March 11, 2009, Incubus posted an update to their official site detailing the new greatest hits album, &quot;Monuments and Melodies&quot;. The first single for the album was &quot;Black Heart Inertia&quot;, released on April 7, 2009, with the album coming two months later on June 16, 2009. Disc one of the album included new singles &quot;Black Heart Inertia&quot; and &quot;Midnight Swim&quot; as well as the top radio hits of the last decade. Then disc two of the album contains songs that have not been released officially on an album, or were rejected demos on prior albums, as well as an acoustic version of &quot;A Certain Shade of Green&quot;, and a cover of the Prince song &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;. The band also announced many confirmed dates for a Summer Amphitheater Tour of the US.

On April 1, 2009, the band posted a fake &quot;making of&quot; video that was filmed on the set of &quot;Black Heart Inertia&quot;. In the video, Brandon and his double &quot;swapped places&quot;. Brandon fetched coffee for his double, and his double also imitated Christian Bale when the DP annoyed him, shouting at and violently chasing him out off of the set. After the short film, the first full stream of &quot;Black Heart Inertia&quot; was uploaded, clocking in at 4:17. On April 2, the full song was streamed on the band&#x27;s official site. The song peaked at No. 7 on the Alternative Songs chart, making it the band&#x27;s 15th Top 10 standing on the list.

On June 16, 2009, &quot;Monuments and Melodies&quot; was released to the public, and opened at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Monuments and Melodies&quot; was the band&#x27;s fourth album to reach the top 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The next month, on July 1, 2009, Boyd stated to &quot;North County Times&quot;, &quot;We are definitely going to be writing ... in hopes of putting out a record sometime in 2010. That&#x27;s the hope. We can never force anything. I definitely have the suspicion that we&#x27;re going to get on the road together this summer, and we&#x27;re just going to start playing and stuff is going to start brewing, and we&#x27;re going to light that fire again.&quot;

In January 2010, it was revealed that former turntablist Gavin &quot;DJ Lyfe&quot; Koppel threatened current turntablist Chris Kilmore in a store on December 28, 2009. Kilmore, who replaced Koppel in 1998, claimed that Koppel &quot;asked me to fight him right there and raised his fists to me.&quot; As result of the incident, a judge granted a new restraining order against Koppel. Kilmore also had a previous restraining order issued against Koppel in 2003 after Koppel allegedly spat in his face.

===&quot;If Not Now, When?&quot; (2011–2013)===

After the release of Boyd&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;The Wild Trapeze&quot; on July 6, 2010, it was announced that Incubus would head back into the studio to begin writing and recording a new studio album, to be released on July 12. The band played a handful of South American tour dates in October 2010, also debuting the song &quot;Surface to Air&quot;.

Incubus announced in March 2011 that the new album was complete and would be released in &quot;August or September&quot; according to Brandon Boyd. Boyd also stated that &quot;this new record is different from anything that we&#x27;ve done.&quot;

On April 2, 2011, band manager Steve Rennie confirmed that their next album had been named &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot;. It was released on July 12, 2011. The album&#x27;s lead single is &quot;Adolescents&quot; and it was posted on the band&#x27;s website on April 4, 2011.

On April 28, 2011, Incubus premiered the video for &quot;Adolescents&quot; and also released a video with behind the scenes footage.

The band revealed that they would tour for 18 months following the release of the record.
To promote the release of &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot;, the band took part in a participatory media exhibit and real-time documentary called Incubus HQ Live that allowed unprecedented fan access and interaction. Footage, music and art from the seven-day event became available as a special edition box set in July 2012.

Mike has said that he is writing music for an orchestral project and also for Incubus. He states in a video (Mikey Gear Tour part II), &quot;My hope is to just write lots of music and then by the time we get to the point to where we&#x27;re going to finish the tour I&#x27;ll have a lot of music written and then people won&#x27;t have to wait five more years for another album (laughs).&quot;

The band joined Linkin Park as co-headliners on the 2012 edition of the Honda Civic Tour. Incubus hinted that they would go on hiatus following the end of the 2012 Honda Civic Tour, but their manager stated that Incubus would only take a break after the tour, not a hiatus.

In October 2012, the band released their second compilation album. The album, entitled &quot;The Essential Incubus&quot;, included songs spanning the band&#x27;s major label career, from 1997&#x27;s &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; EP to 2011&#x27;s &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot;.

In August 2013, the band announced a South American tour to take place later that year.

===&quot;Trust Fall (Side A)&quot; (2014–2015)===

In a radio interview while on the road with his solo band Sons of the Sea, Brandon Boyd announced that fans can expect some new Incubus music in 2015, followed by a tour. Mike Einziger also reinforced this statement when asked on his Twitter page.

In August 2014, Einziger posted a picture of the band on his Instagram in a studio, alluding to the fact they were in the process of creating their album. Subsequently, a few days following the images of the band in a studio, they announced they would be attending the 2015 Soundwave music festival in Australia, alongside Faith No More and Soundgarden. They played at the KROQ&#x27;s Almost Acoustic Christmas 2014 on December 14, their first full band appearance since December 2013. During their performance they debuted a new song called &quot;Trust Fall&quot;. Incubus announced they will release two EP&#x27;s in 2015 with the first, &quot;Trust Fall (Side A)&quot; set for release on May 12, 2015, having been delayed from March 24, 2015. The first single, &quot;Absolution Calling&quot;, was released February 5, 2015, to be followed by the second single, &quot;Trust Fall&quot;, on March 10, 2015.

They performed at Australia&#x27;s Soundwave festival and two other concerts in Australia. In March 2015, they toured Japan, Hawaii and &quot;Festival Cumbre Tajín&quot; in Mexico. They headlined the DC101 Kerfuffle on May 4, 2015. In May and June 2015, they will play at two festivals in Germany (&quot;Rockavaria&quot; and &quot;Grüne Hölle&quot;), one concert in Milan and at in Vienna. They will also be in London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo on the June 16, 2015. Incubus also announced a joint 2015 North American Summer Tour with Deftones. Support will be provided by Death from Above 1979 for most concerts of the tour. The tour began on July 22, 2015, in Clarkston, Michigan, at the DTE Energy Music Theatre and with the final concert of the tour occurring on August 30, 2015, in Chula Vista, California, at the Sleep Train Amphitheatre.

=== &quot;8&quot; (2016–2018) ===

The band reconvened in 2016 to work on their eighth full-length studio album. On February 16, 2017, the lead single &quot;Nimble Bastard&quot; was released, and it was announced that the new album would be titled &quot;8&quot;, with a projected April 21 release date, with Skrillex contributing to the production and mixing of the album. A summer 2017 tour was announced with Jimmy Eat World and Judah &amp; the Lion supporting, and was followed by a world tour across several continents including South America, Asia, and Europe.

===&quot;Trust Fall (Side B)&quot;, the departure of Ben Kenney and &quot;Morning View XXIII&quot; (2019–present)===

The band announced via its Twitter page that a new single titled &quot;Into the Summer&quot; would be released on August 23, 2019. The release of the single coincides with a US tour, to mark the 20th anniversary of &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. In an interview with Loudwire on October 20, 2019, bassist Ben Kenney confirmed the band had completely finished four new songs and were working on more, but didn&#x27;t confirm whether these songs would be released in the form of a new studio album or if they would be released as individual songs. On the matter he said &quot;We don&#x27;t want to get stacked up in a studio making an album. We have to adapt our process &#x27;cause the albums themselves don&#x27;t actually make as big a splash as they used to. We&#x27;re just trying to experiment and explore what we&#x27;re capable of doing, and all the while not take ourselves too seriously and just really enjoy what we get to do.&quot; On January 1, 2020, singer Brandon Boyd announced their next single, &quot;Our Love&quot; will be released on January 31, 2020. The band were scheduled to tour the UK and other European destinations in 2020 but were forced to cancel their shows due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The band returned to touring in 2023; Kenney was forced to sit out the 2023 touring cycle after having surgery to remove a brain tumor; Tal Wilkenfeld took over bass duties until March, and Nicole Row from March onwards. On August 5, the band announced the release of &quot;Morning View XXIII&quot;, a complete rerecording of their 2001 album set for release on October 6 (postponed to early 2024) by Virgin Music. They simultaneously announced a concert at the Hollywood Bowl where they would perform &quot;Morning View&quot; in full, supported by Paris Jackson and Action Bronson, for the same day.

On February 6, 2024, Brandon Boyd revealed via a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that while Ben Kenney had recovered, the bassist had decided to leave Incubus and that his tour replacement, Nicole Row, was now officially a member of the band. By that point Row had already played on the &quot;Morning View XXIII&quot; re-recording and was working with them on material for a new Incubus album.

==Musical style and influences==

&quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot; said that Incubus was a &quot;funky, jazzy, experimental rock band, incorporating elements of hip-hop into its music before it was fashionable to do so.&quot; According to &quot;AllMusic&quot;, the band became &quot;one of the most popular alt-metal bands of the new millennium&quot; by combining heavy metal, funk, jazz, hip hop, techno, post-grunge, rap metal and alternative rock into a &quot;versatile blend&quot;. &quot;The Age&quot; wrote that Incubus &quot;emerged bearing influences of pop, alternative metal and hip-hop, unusual for mainstream rock bands&quot;. &quot;Indianapolis Monthly&quot; said that the band was &quot;part metal, part funk, part jazz and part hip-hop&quot;. The &quot;McClatchy-Tribune News&quot; called Incubus a &quot;spacey, experimental alternative-rock band&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that the band were latecomers to &quot;the great funk metal scare of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

Prior to finding mainstream success in the early 2000s, Incubus was often grouped in with the nu metal movement of the 1990s, alongside other Californian bands such as Korn and Deftones. &quot;NME&quot; described Incubus as a &quot;fusion-generated funk/nu-metal band&quot;. &quot;Maui Time Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Incubus was one of the few nu metal bands to survive the purge of the millennium, and they did it through consistent hard work–the band is constantly either in the studio or on tour–and musical development. There are still elements of nu metal in the music the band makes today as they still have a DJ. But in retrospect, Incubus treated that genre like the fad it was, more an indication of that specific time in music, not as the character of the musicians.&quot; When asked about his thoughts on the scene in a 2013 interview, Brandon Boyd reflected &quot;Something I know that separated us from nu-metal was a lot of those bands had misogynist lyrics, and we never wrote stuff like that. I never wrote lyrics like that. I guess there were similarities in some of my musical and vocal stylings, but then we came off tour for &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; around early &#x27;99, and wrote &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, which was a vastly different album but we were still the same band. We don&#x27;t try and create any kind of album really. I don&#x27;t attempt to write any kind of music, this is just what comes out.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated in 2001 that Incubus is &quot;Cheerful, melodic and polite, a nu-metal band for people who don&#x27;t like nu-metal bands&quot; and also claimed that Boyd was the genre&#x27;s &quot;first official pinup boy&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; similarly wrote in 2004 that &quot;Incubus always stood out from the rest of the mid-&#x27;90s alt-metal crowd, its positive lyrical approach and musical versatility far richer than the overworked wallowing in misery of such acts as Korn and later arrival Staind.&quot;

Guitarist Mike Einziger stated in 2017 that the band&#x27;s diversity is &quot;our greatest asset and our biggest flaw. We don&#x27;t fit anywhere and we never have. We were never punk rock enough for the Warped Tour, we were never metal enough for Ozzfest, we were never quite indie rock or cool enough for Lollapalooza. We&#x27;ve carved our own path, and we&#x27;re really humbled by the fact that we&#x27;ve had so many supporters and people who appreciate our music.&quot; The band has also used a wide variety of instruments in their music that are not traditionally associated with use in rock music, including a djembe, sitar, didgeridoo, and bongos on many of their earlier tracks and during live performances, and with the use of a pipa given to the band by rock musician Steve Vai which is played by Einziger in the song &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;.

From the mid 2000s, Incubus began to adopt a softer sound, moving from rock towards a &quot;funk-pop-rock&quot; sound. This was particularly apparent by &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot; (2011), which was described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;slick, inert ripples of interchangeable power pop&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; compared the sound of &quot;8&quot; (2017) and its more ballad-like moments to Ed Sheeran. Their 2020 EP &quot;Trust Fall (side B)&quot; was described by &quot;Sputnik music&quot; as &quot;inoffensive pop&quot;.

Incubus was heavily influenced by the &quot;free-form funk&quot; of Primus. Other influences on the band&#x27;s sound include Faith No More, Ani DiFranco, Stone Temple Pilots, Soundgarden and Phish. Boyd reflected on the band&#x27;s initial influences in 2012, stating &quot;At that time [the early &#x27;90s] music got turned on its ear. We were listening to bands like Primus, Mr. Bungle, John Zorn, we also got into Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine. What&#x27;s amazing is those bands are still good now, they&#x27;re still relevant now. Alice in Chains, Red Hot Chili Peppers, these bands that were coming of age right when we were growing up, at that most important, kind of pliable time in your youth. We were basically so inspired by music, that we decided to make music on our own.&quot; Critics have compared Boyd&#x27;s style of singing to Faith No More/Mr. Bungle vocalist Mike Patton, whom the band have also credited as a major influence.

<text>The Dozens is a game played between two contestants in which the participants insult each other until one of them gives up. Common in African American communities, the Dozens is almost exclusively played in front of an audience, who encourage the participants to reply with increasingly severe insults in order to heighten the tension and consequently make the contest more interesting to watch. 

Comments in the game may focus on the opposite player&#x27;s intelligence, appearance, competency, social status, and financial situation. Disparaging remarks about the other player&#x27;s family members are common, especially regarding their mother. Commentary is often related to sexual issues, and this version of the game is referred to as the &quot;Dirty Dozens&quot;.

According to sociologist Harry Lefever and journalist John Leland, the game is played almost entirely by African-Americans; other ethnic groups often fail to understand how to play the game and can take remarks in the Dozens seriously. Its popularity is higher among low-income and urban communities, but it is also found in middle-class and rural settings. Both men and women participate, but the game is more commonly played among men.

==Terminology==
Playing the Dozens is also known as &quot;biddin, &quot;blazing&quot;, &quot;roasting&quot;, &quot;hiking&quot;, &quot;capping&quot;, &quot;clowning&quot;, &quot;ranking&quot;, &quot;ragging&quot;, &quot;rekking&quot;, &quot;crumming&quot;, &quot;sounding&quot;, &quot;checking&quot;, &quot;joning&quot;, &quot;woofing&quot;, &quot;wolfing&quot;, “skinning”, &quot;sigging&quot;, &quot;scoring&quot;, &quot;signifying&quot; or &quot;jiving&quot;, while the insults themselves are known as &quot;snaps&quot;.

==Origins==
===Etymology===
The term &quot;dozens&quot; has long been debated as to its etymology, with urban legend abounding. The first academic treatment of the Dozens was made in 1939 by Yale-based psychologist and social theorist John Dollard, who described the importance of the game among African-American men, and how it is generally played. Dollard&#x27;s description is considered pioneering and accurate. Dollard originally wrote that he was unaware of how the term &quot;Dozens&quot; developed, although he suggested a popular twelve-part rhyme may have been the reason for its name. He only speculated on how the game itself grew to such prominence. &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; claims the origin, first attested in 1928, is probably from , in the original sense of &quot;a beating or thrashing&quot;.

Other authors following Dollard have added their theories; author John Leland describes an etymology, writing that the term is a modern dialectal survival of an English verb —&quot;to dozen&quot;— dating back at least to the 14th century and meaning &quot;to stun, stupefy, daze&quot; or &quot;to make insensible, torpid, powerless&quot;.

Author and professor Mona Lisa Saloy theorizes a different etymology in &quot;African American Oral Traditions in Louisiana&quot; (1998):

The dozens has its origins in the slave trade of New Orleans where deformed slaves—generally slaves punished with mutilation for disobedience—were grouped in lots of a &#x27;cheap dozen&#x27; for sale to slave owners. For a Black to be sold as part of the &#x27;dozens&#x27; was the lowest blow possible.

===Anthropology===
Amuzie Chimezie, writing in the &quot;Journal of Black Studies&quot; in 1976, connects the Dozens to a Nigerian game called &quot;Ikocha Nkocha&quot;, literally translated as &quot;making disparaging remarks&quot;. This form of the game is played by children and adolescents, and takes place in the evening, in the presence of parents and siblings. Commentary among the Igbo is more restrained: remarks about family members are rare, and are based more in fanciful imaginings than participants&#x27; actual traits. In contrast, during the game in Ghana, which is also commonly played in the evenings, insults are frequently directed at family members. 

Amiri Baraka independently concluded that the Dozens originated in Africa and states that they are a surviving adaptation of &quot;African songs of recrimination.&quot;

==Purpose and practice==
The Dozens is a &quot;pattern of interactive insult&quot; evident among all classes of African Americans, among men and women, children and adults. Usually two participants engage in banter, but always in front of others, who incite the participants to continue the game by making the insults worse. Frequently used topics among players who &quot;play the Dozens&quot; or are &quot;put in the Dozens&quot; are one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s lack of intelligence, ugliness, alleged homosexuality, alleged incest, cowardice, poor hygiene, and exaggerations of physical defects, such as crossed eyes.

Participants in the Dozens are required to exhibit mental acuity and proficiency with words. In his memoir &quot;Die Nigger Die!&quot; (1969), H. Rap Brown writes that the children he grew up with employed the Dozens to kill time and stave off boredom, in the way that whites might play Scrabble. Brown asserts playing the game is a form of mental exercise. Sociologist Harry Lefever states that verbal skill and wit is just as valued among African Americans as physical strength: &quot;Verbal facility is thus a criterion that is used to separate the men from the boys&quot;. According to author John Leland, the object of the game is to stupefy and daze one&#x27;s opponents with swift and skillful speech. The meaning of the words, however, is lost in the game. The object of the game is the performance.

Adolescents incorporate more sexual themes in their versions, often called the &quot;Dirty Dozens&quot;. The language also becomes more playful, with participants including rhymes:

&lt;poem&gt;
I was walking through the jungle
With my dick in my hand
I was the baddest motherfucker
In the jungle land
I looked up in the tree
And what did I see
Your little black mama
Trying to piss on me
I picked up a rock
And hit her in the cock
And knocked that bitch
About a half a block.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Many forms of the Dozens address sexual situations or body parts:
&lt;poem&gt;
If you wanta play the Dozens
Play them fast.
I&#x27;ll tell you how many bull-dogs
Your mammy had.
She didn&#x27;t have one;
She didn&#x27;t have two;
She had nine damned dozens
And then she had you.
&lt;/poem&gt;
== Analysis ==
A variety of explanations have been offered for the popularity of the Dozens. Its development is intertwined with the oppression African Americans encountered, first as slaves and later as second-class citizens. 

John Dollard viewed the Dozens as a manifestation of frustration aggression theory, a theory that he helped develop. He hypothesized that African Americans, as victims of racism, have been unable to respond in kind towards their oppressors, and instead shifted their anger to friends and neighbors, as displayed in the strings of insults. Folklorist Alan Dundes asserted that an approach based on psychoanalytic theory and American oppression ignores the possibility that the Dozens may be native to Africa. In addition to similar forms of verbal combat found in Nigeria and Ghana, where many African Americans have ancestral roots, Bantu and Kisii boys have been observed dueling verbally by attacking each other&#x27;s mothers.

The game is also viewed as a tool for preparing young African Americans to cope with verbal abuse without becoming enraged. The ability to remain composed during the Dozens is considered a hallmark of virtue among many African Americans. 
In the deepest sense, the essence of the dozens lies not in the insults but in the response of the victim. Taking umbrage is considered an infantile response. Maturity and sophistication bring the capability to suffer the vile talk with aplomb at least, and, hopefully, with grace and wit.

Nonetheless, many such contests do end in fights. Abrahams states that when African Americans reach a certain age, between 16 and 26, the game loses much of its appeal and attempts to enter into sparring contests often result in violence. John Leland writes that the loser of the Dozens is the one who takes his opponent&#x27;s words at face value, therefore ending his own performance in the back-and-forth exchange.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Playing the Dozens&quot; is referenced in Zora Neale Hurston&#x27;s 1937 novel &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot;, where Janie, the protagonist, returns her husband&#x27;s insults with some of her own. &quot;Playing the dozens&quot; and &quot;signifying&quot; are also frequently referenced in Alston Anderson&#x27;s 1959 short story collection &quot;Lover Man&quot;. The sketch comedy show In Living Color featured a skit called &quot;The Dirty Dozens&quot; prominently featuring Jamie Foxx.

<text>Dowsing is a type of divination employed in attempts to locate ground water, buried metals or ores, gemstones, oil, claimed radiations (radiesthesia), gravesites, malign &quot;earth vibrations&quot; and many other objects and materials without the use of a scientific apparatus. It is also known as divining (especially in water divining), doodlebugging (particularly in the United States, in searching for petroleum or treasure) or water finding, or water witching (in the United States).

A Y-shaped twig or rod, or two L-shaped ones, called dowsing rods or divining rods are normally used, and the motion of these are said to reveal the location of the target material. The motion of such dowsing devices is generally attributed to random movement, or to the ideomotor phenomenon, a psychological response where a subject makes motions unconsciously.

The scientific evidence shows that dowsing is no more effective than random chance. It is therefore regarded as a pseudoscience.

==History==
===Early divination and religion===

Dowsing originated in ancient times, when it was treated as a form of divination. The Catholic Church, however, banned the practice completely.

Reformer Martin Luther perpetuated the Catholic ban, in 1518 listing divining for metals as an act that broke the first commandment (i.e., as occultism).

Old texts about searching for water do not mention using the divining twig, and the first account of this practice was in 1568.
Sir William F. Barrett wrote in his 1911 book &quot;Psychical Research&quot; that:
In 1662, divining with rods was declared to be &quot;superstitious, or rather satanic&quot; by a Jesuit, Gaspar Schott, though he later noted that he was not sure that the devil was always responsible for the movement of the rod. In southern France in the 17th century, it was used to track criminals and heretics. Its abuse led to a decree of the inquisition in 1701, forbidding its employment for purposes of justice.

An epigram by Samuel Sheppard, from &quot;Epigrams theological, philosophical, and romantick&quot; (1651) runs thus:

===Modern dowsing===
Dowsing practices used in an attempt to locate metals are still performed much like they were during the 16th century. The 1550 edition of Sebastian Münster&#x27;s &quot;Cosmographia&quot; contains a woodcut of a dowser with forked rod in hand walking over a cutaway image of a mining operation. The rod is labeled in Latin and German; &quot; &quot;–&quot; &quot; (&#x27;Rod Divine, Luck-Rod&#x27;), but there is no text accompanying the woodcut. By 1556, Georgius Agricola&#x27;s treatment of mining and smelting of ore, &quot;De Re Metallica&quot;, included a detailed description of dowsing for metal ore.

In the 16th century, German deep mining technology was in enormous demand all over Europe. German miners were licensed to live and work in England; particularly in the Stannaries (tin mines) of Devon and Cornwall and in Cumbria. In other parts of England, the technique was used in the royal mines for calamine. By 1638 German miners were recorded using the technique in silver mines in Wales.

The Middle Low German name for a forked stick (Y-rod) was (&#x27;striking rod&#x27;). This was translated in the sixteenth century Cornish dialect to ( according to William Barrett) (Middle English, &#x27;to strike, fall&#x27;). By the seventeenth century the English term &quot;dowsing&quot; was coming into common use.

In the lead-mining area of the Mendip Hills in Somerset, England in the 17th century the natural philosopher Robert Boyle, inspired by the writings of Agricola, watched a practitioner try to find &quot;latent veins of metals&quot;. Boyle saw the hazel divining rod () stoop in the hands of the diviner, who protested that he was not applying any force to the twig; Boyle accepted the man&#x27;s genuine belief but himself remained unconvinced. Towards the end of the century, in 1691 the philosopher John Locke, who was born in the English West Country, used the term &quot;deusing-rod&quot; for the Old Latin name . So, &quot;dowse&quot; is synonymous with &quot;strike&quot;, hence the phrases: to &quot;dowse&quot;/&quot;strike&quot; a light, to &quot;dowse&quot;/&quot;strike&quot; a sail.

Dowsing was conducted in South Dakota in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to help homesteaders, farmers and ranchers locate water wells on their property.

The military have occasionally resorted to dowsing techniques. In the First World War Gallipoli campaign, sapper Stephen Kelly, of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, Australian Expeditionary Force, became well known for finding water for the British troops. In the late 1960s during the Vietnam War, some United States Marines used dowsing when locating weapons and tunnels. As late as in 1986, when 31 soldiers were taken by an avalanche during an operation in the NATO drill Anchor Express in Vassdalen, Norway, the Norwegian army attempted to locate soldiers buried in the avalanche using dowsing as a search method.

Dowsing is still used by some farmers and water engineers in Britain; however, many of the country&#x27;s utilities have distanced themselves from the practice.

===Postulated mechanisms===
Early attempts at an explanation of dowsing were based on the notion that the divining rod was physically affected by emanations from substances of interest. The following explanation is from William Pryce&#x27;s 1778 &quot;Mineralogia Cornubiensis&quot;:

A study towards the end of the 19th century concluded that the phenomenon was attributed to cryptesthesia, where the practitioner makes unconscious observations of the terrain and involuntarily influences the movement of the rod. Early investigations by members of the Society for Psychical Research endorsed this view.

Committed parapsychologist G. N. M. Tyrrell also believed that the action of the rod was caused by involuntary muscular movements and debunked the theory of external influences.

Dowsing over maps, prior to visiting the site, was also believed to work, hence some kind of clairvoyance was proposed. This was believed to act on the nervous system, rather than on the muscles directly. These various mechanisms remain in contention among dowsers.

===Fraudulent security devices===

In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries a number of dowsing-like devices were marketed for modern police and military use, primarily as explosive detectors, such as the ADE 651, Sniffex, and the GT200. In consequence of these frauds, in 1999 the United States National Institute of Justice issued advice against buying equipment based on dowsing.

==Equipment==
The device used by a dowser is typically referred to as a dowsing or divining rod, even though it may not be rod-shaped.

===Dowsing twig===

Traditionally, the most common method used is the dowsing twig, a forked (Y-shaped) branch from a tree or bush. Some dowsers prefer branches from particular trees, and some prefer the branches to be freshly cut. Hazel twigs in Europe and witch-hazel in the United States are traditionally commonly chosen, as are branches from willow or peach trees. The two ends on the forked side are held one in each hand with the third (the stem of the Y) pointing straight ahead. The dowser then walks slowly over the places where the target (for example, minerals or water) may be, and the dowsing rod is expected to dip, incline or twitch when a discovery is made. This method is sometimes known as &quot;willow witching.&quot; Some dowsers would hang a golden ring on the edge of the dowsing rod, or split the tip to slide in a silver coin.

===Pair of rods===

Many modern dowsers use a pair of L-shaped metal rods. One rod is held in each hand, with the short arm of the L held upright, and the long arm pointing forward. The upright arm is often free to rotate inside a tube. When something is &quot;found,&quot; the rods move in synchrony. Depending on the dowser, they may cross over or swing apart. If the object is long and straight, such as a water pipe, the rods may point in opposite directions, showing its orientation. The rods may be fashioned from wire coat hangers or wire flags used for locating utilities. Glass or plastic rods have also been accepted. Straight rods are also sometimes used for the same purposes, and were common in early 19th century New England.

===Pendulum===
A pendulum weight on a short cord or thread is the tool of choice for many modern dowsers. The dowser holds the cord in one hand and allows the pendulum to swing freely. The dowser then observes how the pendulum is swinging and interprets the motion to offer insights.

==Studies==
* Dowsing studies from the early twentieth century were examined by geologist John Walter Gregory in a report for the Smithsonian Institution. Gregory concluded that the results were a matter of chance or explained by observations from ground surface clues.
* Geologist W. A. MacFadyen tested three dowsers during 1943–1944 in Algeria. The results were entirely negative.
* A 1948 study in New Zealand by P. A. Ongley tested 75 dowsers&#x27; ability to detect water. None of them was more reliable than chance. According to Ongley &quot;not one showed the slightest accuracy.&quot;
* Archaeometrist Martin Aitken tested British dowser P. A. Raine in 1959. Raine failed to dowse the location of a buried kiln that had been identified by a magnetometer.
* In 1971, dowsing experiments were organized by British engineer R. A. Foulkes on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. The results were &quot;no more reliable than a series of guesses&quot;.
* Physicists John Taylor and Eduardo Balanovski reported in 1978 a series of experiments they conducted that searched for unusual electromagnetic fields emitted by dowsing subjects; they did not detect any.
* A 1979 review by Evon Z. Vogt and Ray Hyman examined many controlled studies of dowsing for water, and found that none of them showed better than chance results.
* British academics Richard N. Bailey, Eric Cambridge, and H. Denis Briggs, carried out dowsing experiments at the grounds of various churches. They reported successful results in their book &quot;Dowsing and Church Archaeology&quot; (1988). Their experiments were critically examined by archaeologist Martijn Van Leusen who suggested they were badly designed and the authors had redefined the test parameters on what was classified as a &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot; to obtain positive results.
* A 2006 study of grave dowsing in Iowa reviewed 14 published studies and determined that none of them correctly predicted the location of human burials, and simple scientific experiments demonstrated that the fundamental principles commonly used to explain grave dowsing were incorrect.
* A randomized double-blind trial in 2012 was carried out to determine whether homeopaths were able to distinguish between Bryonia and placebo by use of a dowsing method. The results were negative.

===Kassel 1991 study===
A 1990 double-blind study was undertaken in Kassel, Germany, under the direction of the &quot;Gesellschaft zur Wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung von Parawissenschaften&quot; (Society for the Scientific Investigation of the Parasciences). James Randi offered a US$10,000 prize to any successful dowser. The three-day test of some thirty dowsers involved plastic pipes through which water flow could be controlled and directed. The pipes were buried under a level field, the position of each marked on the surface with a colored strip. The dowsers had to tell whether water was running through each pipe. All the dowsers signed a statement agreeing this was a fair test of their abilities and that they expected a 100% success rate. However, the results were no better than chance, and no one was awarded the prize.

===Betz 1990 study===
In a 1987–88 study in Munich by Hans-Dieter Betz and other scientists, 500 dowsers were initially tested for their skill, and the experimenters selected the best 43 among them for further tests. Water was pumped through a pipe on the ground floor of a two-story barn. Before each test, the pipe was moved in a direction perpendicular to the water flow. On the upper floor, each dowser was asked to determine the position of the pipe. Over two years, the dowsers performed 843 such tests and, of the 43 pre-selected and extensively tested candidates, at least 37 showed no dowsing ability. The results from the remaining 6 were said to be better than chance, resulting in the experimenters&#x27; conclusion that some dowsers &quot;in particular tasks, showed an extraordinarily high rate of success, which can scarcely if at all be explained as due to chance … a real core of dowser-phenomena can be regarded as empirically proven.&quot;

Five years after the Munich study was published, Jim T. Enright, a professor of physiology who emphasized correct data analysis procedure, contended that the study&#x27;s results are merely consistent with statistical fluctuations and not significant. He believed the experiments provided &quot;the most convincing disproof imaginable that dowsers can do what they claim&quot;, stating that the data analysis was &quot;special, unconventional and customized&quot;. Replacing it with &quot;more ordinary analyses&quot;, he noted that the &quot;best&quot; dowser was on average out of closer to a mid-line guess, an advantage of 0.04%, and that the five other &quot;good&quot; dowsers were on average farther than a mid-line guess. Enright emphasized that the experimenters should have decided beforehand how to statistically analyze the results; if they only afterward chose the statistical analysis that showed the greatest success, then their conclusions would not be valid until replicated by another test analyzed by the same method. He further pointed out that the six &quot;good&quot; dowsers did not perform any better than chance in separate tests. Another study published in &quot;Pathophysiology&quot; hypothesized that such experiments as this one that were carried out in the twentieth century could have been interfered with by man-made radio frequency radiation, as test subjects&#x27; bodies absorbed the radio waves and unconscious hand movement reactions took place following the standing waves or intensity variations.

==Scientific reception==
===Ideomotor phenomenon===
Science writers such as William Benjamin Carpenter (1877), Millais Culpin (1920), and Martin Gardner (1957) accept the view of some dowsers that the movement of dowsing rods is the result of unconscious muscular action. This view is widely accepted amongst the scientific community. The dowsing apparatus is known to amplify slight movements of the hands caused by a phenomenon known as the ideomotor response: people&#x27;s subconscious minds may influence their bodies without consciously deciding to take action. This would make the dowsing rod susceptible to the dowsers&#x27; subconscious knowledge or perception; and also to confirmation bias.

===Pseudoscience===
Dowsing is in all other respects considered to be a pseudoscience.

Psychologist David Marks in a 1986 article in &quot;Nature&quot; included dowsing in a list of &quot;effects which until recently were claimed to be paranormal but which can now be explained from within orthodox science.&quot; Specifically, dowsing could be explained in terms of sensory cues, expectancy effects, and probability.

Science writer Peter Daempfle has noted that when dowsing is subjected to scientific testing, it fails. Daempfle has written that although some dowsers claim success, this can be attributed to the underground water table being distributed relatively uniformly in certain areas.

According to archaeologist Kenneth Feder, &quot;the vast majority of archaeologists don&#x27;t use dowsing, because they don&#x27;t believe it works.&quot;

Psychologist Chris French has noted that &quot;dowsing does not work when it is tested under properly controlled conditions that rule out the use of other cues to indicate target location.&quot;

Water dowsers often achieve good results because random chance has a high probability of finding water in favorable terrain.

<text>Lloyd deMause (pronounced &quot;de-Moss&quot;; September 19, 1931 – April 23, 2020) was an American lay psychoanalyst and social historian, best known for his pioneering work in the field of psychohistory.

He graduated from Columbia College and did graduate work in political science at Columbia University and later trained as a psychoanalyst. He taught psychohistory at the City University of New York. He is the founder of the &quot;Journal of Psychohistory&quot;.

==Psychohistory==
Beginning in the 1970s, DeMause began conceiving of psychohistory, a field of study of the psychological motivations of historical events, and their associated patterns of behavior. It seeks to understand the emotional origin of the social and political behavior of groups and nations—past and present—by analyzing events in childhood and the family, especially child abuse.

==Legacy==
In a 1994 interview with deMause in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, interviewer Stephen Schiff wrote that &quot;to buy into psychohistory, you have to subscribe to some fairly woolly assumptions [...], for instance, that a nation&#x27;s child-rearing techniques affect its foreign policy&quot;, but confessed that &quot;deMause&#x27;s analyses have often been weirdly prescient.&quot;

==Controversy==
Contributing to his ostracization from psychoanalytic circles, deMause was a contributor to the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria of the early 1990s, in part via the circulation of his article &quot;Why Cults Terrorize and Kill Children&quot;, where he labelled skeptics of reports of the abuse &quot;molesters&quot; and &quot;pedophile advocates&quot;. The article was used as a reliable source by ritual abuse proponents.

==Publications==
DeMause published over 90 scholarly articles and several books.

<text>&quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot; is a Canadian patriotic song written by Alexander Muir (1830–1906) in 1867, the year of Canada&#x27;s Confederation. He wrote the work after serving with the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Toronto in the Battle of Ridgeway against the Fenians in 1866.

==History==

Muir was said to have been inspired to write this song by a large maple tree which stood on his street in front of Maple Cottage, a house at Memory Lane and Laing Street in Toronto. The song became quite popular in English Canada and for many years served as an unofficial national anthem. Because of its strongly British perspective it became unpopular amongst French Canadians, and this prevented it from ever becoming an official state anthem, even though it was seriously considered for that role and was even used as a &quot;de facto&quot; state anthem in many instances.

The tree which inspired Muir&#x27;s song fell during a windstorm on the night of July 19–20, 2013. Wood from the tree was used to make objects that will preserve its importance to Canadian culture, including the speaker&#x27;s podium for Toronto City Council, and the Maple Leaf Forever Guitars. Residents have expressed their hope that the city will be able to start a new tree from one of the branches.

During the early 1870s, Alexander Muir was an elementary school teacher in Newmarket, north of Toronto.

It has been asserted that Muir&#x27;s words, however, while certainly pro-British, were not anti-French, and he revised the lyrics of the first verse from &quot;Here may it wave, our boast, our pride, and join in love together / The Thistle, Shamrock, Rose entwine&quot; to &quot;/ The Lily, Thistle, Shamrock, Rose, the Maple Leaf forever&quot; the thistle represented Scotland; the shamrock, Ireland; and the rose, England adding &quot;Lily&quot;, a French symbol, to the list. Muir was attempting to express that under the Union Flag, the British and French were united as Canadians.

&quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot; is also the authorized regimental march of The Royal Westminster Regiment. Additionally, it is the Regimental Slow March of the Fort Henry Guard.

The song makes reference to James Wolfe capturing Quebec in 1759 during the Seven Years&#x27; War and the Battle of Queenston Heights and Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane during the War of 1812.

===Lyrics===
&lt;poem&gt;
In days of yore, from Britain&#x27;s shore,
Wolfe, the dauntless hero, came
And planted firm Britannia&#x27;s flag
On Canada&#x27;s fair domain.
Here may it wave, our boast, our pride
And, joined in love together,
The thistle, shamrock, rose entwine (Also sung: The lily, thistle, shamrock, rose)
The Maple Leaf forever!

&quot;Chorus&quot;
 The Maple Leaf, our emblem dear,
 The Maple Leaf forever!
 God save our King and Heaven bless
 The Maple Leaf forever!

At Queenston Heights and Lundy&#x27;s Lane,
Our brave fathers, side by side,
For freedom, homes and loved ones dear,
Firmly stood and nobly died;
And those dear rights which they maintained,
We swear to yield them never!
Our watchword evermore shall be
&quot;The Maple Leaf forever!&quot;

&quot;Chorus&quot;

Our fair Dominion now extends
From Cape Race to Nootka Sound;
May peace forever be our lot,
And plenteous store abound:
And may those ties of love be ours
Which discord cannot sever,
And flourish green o&#x27;er freedom&#x27;s home
The Maple Leaf forever!

&quot;Chorus&quot;

On merry England&#x27;s far famed land
May kind heaven sweetly smile,
God bless old Scotland evermore
and Ireland&#x27;s Em&#x27;rald Isle!
And swell the song both loud and long
Till rocks and forest quiver!
God save our King and Heaven bless
The Maple Leaf forever!

&quot;Chorus&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Alternative lyrics===

CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Metro Morning&quot; show in Toronto ran a contest to find new lyrics for the song in 1997. The contest was won by Romanian immigrant, mathematician, and now a songwriter, actor and poet, Vladimir Radian, who came to Canada in the 1980s. This version received its first full orchestral treatment on June 27, 1997, at a concert by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.

The new version removed all references to British-Canadian heritage, but added a special reference to Quebec&#x27;s provincial symbol, the fleur-de-lis.

Padre G. E. Benton, a former Canadian army chaplain, also wrote a revised version.

The Canadian vocal harmony trio &quot;Finest Kind&quot; (Ian Robb, Ann Downey and Shelley Posen) recorded &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot; on their 2003 CD &quot;Silks &amp; Spices&quot;. This version, with new words co-written by Posen and Robb and harmony arrangement by the trio, was sung at the ceremonial planting in Ottawa of two silver maple seedlings: direct descendants of the tree which is thought to have inspired Alexander Muir to write the original song in 1867. The ceremony occurred on November 2, 2014, and was attended by several local dignitaries and military veterans. The words acknowledge the Aboriginal, French, English and &quot;new Canadian&quot; contributions to the evolution of Canada, and highlight Canada&#x27;s more recent military role as peacekeepers &quot;where hate and war divide&quot;. The second verse also references John McCrae&#x27;s iconic First World War poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;.

===Maple Leaf Gardens / Winter Olympics===
During the final game of the Toronto Maple Leafs at their former home arena, Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Anne Murray sang another version (modified from Radian&#x27;s version) of the &quot;Maple Leaf Forever&quot;. This version was also used by Michael Bublé during the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony.

<doc id="54513" wikidata="Q171058" url="?curid=54513" title="Opal">
<text>Opal is a hydrated amorphous form of silica (SiO2·&quot;n&quot;H2O); its water content may range from 3% to 21% by weight, but is usually between 6% and 10%. Due to the amorphous (chemical) physical structure, it is classified as a mineraloid, unlike crystalline forms of silica, which are considered minerals. It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of rock, being most commonly found with limonite, sandstone, rhyolite, marl, and basalt.

The name &quot;opal&quot; is believed to be derived from the Sanskrit word (), which means &#x27;jewel&#x27;, and later the Greek derivative ().

There are two broad classes of opal: precious and common. Precious opal displays play-of-color (iridescence); common opal does not. Play-of-color is defined as &quot;a pseudo chromatic optical effect resulting in flashes of colored light from certain minerals, as they are turned in white light.&quot; The internal structure of precious opal causes it to diffract light, resulting in play-of-color. Depending on the conditions in which it formed, opal may be transparent, translucent, or opaque, and the background color may be white, black, or nearly any color of the visual spectrum. Black opal is considered the rarest, while white, gray, and green opals are the most common.

== Precious opal ==

Precious opal shows a variable interplay of internal colors, and though it is a mineraloid, it has an internal structure. At microscopic scales, precious opal is composed of silica spheres some in diameter in a hexagonal or cubic close-packed lattice. It was shown by J. V. Sanders in the mid-1960s that these ordered silica spheres produce the internal colors by causing the interference and diffraction of light passing through the microstructure of the opal. The regularity of the sizes and the packing of these spheres is a prime determinant of the quality of precious opal. Where the distance between the regularly packed planes of spheres is around half the wavelength of a component of visible light, the light of that wavelength may be subject to diffraction from the grating created by the stacked planes. The colors that are observed are determined by the spacing between the planes and the orientation of planes with respect to the incident light. The process can be described by Bragg&#x27;s law of diffraction.

Visible light cannot pass through large thicknesses of the opal. This is the basis of the optical band gap in a photonic crystal. In addition, microfractures may be filled with secondary silica and form thin lamellae inside the opal during its formation. The term &quot;opalescence&quot; is commonly used to describe this unique and beautiful phenomenon, which in gemology is termed &quot;play of color&quot;. In gemology, opalescence is applied to the hazy-milky-turbid sheen of common or potch opal which does not show a play of color. Opalescence is a form of adularescence.

For gemstone use, most opal is cut and polished to form a cabochon. &quot;Natural&quot; opal refers to polished stones consisting wholly of precious opal. Opals too thin to produce a &quot;natural&quot; opal may be combined with other materials to form &quot;composite&quot; gems. An opal doublet consists of a relatively thin layer of precious opal, backed by a layer of dark-colored material, most commonly ironstone, dark or black common opal (potch), onyx, or obsidian. The darker backing emphasizes the play of color and results in a more attractive display than a lighter potch. An opal triplet is similar to a doublet but has a third layer, a domed cap of clear quartz or plastic on the top. The cap takes a high polish and acts as a protective layer for the opal. The top layer also acts as a magnifier, to emphasize the play of color of the opal beneath, which is often an inferior specimen or an extremely thin section of precious opal. Triplet opals tend to have a more artificial appearance and are not classed as precious gemstones, but rather &quot;composite&quot; gemstones. Jewelry applications of precious opal can be somewhat limited by opal&#x27;s sensitivity to heat due primarily to its relatively high water content and predisposition to scratching. Combined with modern techniques of polishing, a doublet opal can produce a similar effect to Natural black or boulder opal at a fraction of the price. Doublet opal also has the added benefit of having genuine opal as the top visible and touchable layer, unlike triplet opals.

==Common opal==

Besides the gemstone varieties that show a play of color, the other kinds of common opal include the milk opal, milky bluish to greenish (which can sometimes be of gemstone quality); resin opal, which is honey-yellow with a resinous luster; wood opal, which is caused by the replacement of the organic material in wood with opal; menilite, which is brown or grey; hyalite, a colorless glass-clear opal sometimes called Muller&#x27;s glass; geyserite, also called siliceous sinter, deposited around hot springs or geysers; and diatomaceous earth, the accumulations of diatom shells or tests. Common opal often displays a hazy-milky-turbid sheen from within the stone. In gemology, this optical effect is strictly defined as opalescence which is a form of adularescence.

== Varieties of common opal ==

&quot;Girasol opal&quot; is a term sometimes mistakenly and improperly used to refer to fire opals, as well as a type of transparent to semitransparent type milky quartz from Madagascar which displays an asterism, or star effect when cut properly. However, the true girasol opal is a type of hyalite opal that exhibits a bluish glow or sheen that follows the light source around. It is not a play of color as seen in precious opal, but rather an effect from microscopic inclusions. It is also sometimes referred to as water opal, too, when it is from Mexico. The two most notable locations of this type of opal are Oregon and Mexico.

A Peruvian opal (also called blue opal) is a semi-opaque to opaque blue-green stone found in Peru, which is often cut to include the matrix in the more opaque stones. It does not display a play of color. Blue opal also comes from Oregon and Idaho in the Owyhee region, as well as from Nevada around the Virgin Valley.

Opal is also formed by diatoms. Diatoms are a form of algae that, when they die, often form layers at the bottoms of lakes, bays, or oceans. Their cell walls are made up of hydrated silicon dioxide which gives them structural coloration and therefore the appearance of tiny opals when viewed under a microscope. These cell walls or &quot;tests&quot; form the “grains” for the diatomaceous earth. This sedimentary rock is white, opaque, and chalky in texture. Diatomite has multiple industrial uses such as filtering or adsorbing since it has a fine particle size and very porous nature, and gardening to increase water absorption.

==History==
Opal was rare and very valuable in antiquity. In Europe, it was a gem prized by royalty. Until the opening of vast deposits in Australia in the 19th century the only known source was beyond the Roman frontier in Slovakia. Opal is the national gemstone of Australia.

== Sources ==

The primary sources of opal are Australia and Ethiopia, but because of inconsistent and widely varying accountings of their respective levels of extraction, it is difficult to accurately state what proportion of the global supply of opal comes from either country.
Australian opal has been cited as accounting for 95–97% of the world&#x27;s supply of precious opal, with the state of South Australia accounting for 80% of the world&#x27;s supply. In 2012, Ethiopian opal production was estimated to be by the United States Geological Survey. USGS data from the same period (2012), reveals Australian opal production to be $41 million. Because of the units of measurement, it is not possible to directly compare Australian and Ethiopian opal production, but these data and others suggest that the traditional percentages given for Australian opal production may be overstated. Yet, the validity of data in the USGS report appears to conflict with that of Laurs et al. and Mesfin, who estimated the 2012 Ethiopian opal output (from Wegeltena) to be only .

=== Australia ===
The town of Coober Pedy in South Australia is a major source of opal. The world&#x27;s largest and most valuable gem opal &quot;Olympic Australis&quot; was found in August 1956 at the &quot;Eight Mile&quot; opal field in Coober Pedy. It weighs and is long, with a height of and a width of .

The Mintabie Opal Field in South Australia located about northwest of Coober Pedy has also produced large quantities of crystal opal and the rarer black opal. Over the years, it has been sold overseas incorrectly as Coober Pedy opal. The black opal is said to be some of the best examples found in Australia.

Andamooka in South Australia is also a major producer of matrix opal, crystal opal, and black opal. Another Australian town, Lightning Ridge in New South Wales, is the main source of black opal, opal containing a predominantly dark background (dark gray to blue-black displaying the play of color), collected from the Griman Creek Formation. Boulder opal consists of concretions and fracture fillings in a dark siliceous ironstone matrix. It is found sporadically in western Queensland, from Kynuna in the north, to Yowah and Koroit in the south. Its largest quantities are found around Jundah and Quilpie in South West Queensland. Australia also has opalized fossil remains, including dinosaur bones in New South Wales and South Australia, and marine creatures in South Australia.

=== Ethiopia ===
It has been reported that Northern African opal was used to make tools as early as 4000 BC. The first published report of gem opal from Ethiopia appeared in 1994, with the discovery of precious opal in the Menz Gishe District, North Shewa Province. The opal, found mostly in the form of nodules, was of volcanic origin and was found predominantly within weathered layers of rhyolite. This Shewa Province opal was mostly dark brown in color and had a tendency to crack. These qualities made it unpopular in the gem trade. In 2008, a new opal deposit was found approximately 180 km north of Shewa Province, near the town of Wegeltena, in Ethiopia&#x27;s Wollo Province. The Wollo Province opal was different from the previous Ethiopian opal finds in that it more closely resembled the sedimentary opals of Australia and Brazil, with a light background and often vivid play-of-color. Wollo Province opal, more commonly referred to as &quot;Welo&quot; or &quot;Wello&quot; opal, has become the dominant Ethiopian opal in the gem trade.

=== Virgin Valley, Nevada ===
The Virgin Valley opal fields of Humboldt County in northern Nevada produce a wide variety of precious black, crystal, white, fire, and lemon opal. The black fire opal is the official gemstone of Nevada. Most of the precious opal is partial wood replacement. The precious opal is hosted and found &quot;in situ&quot; within a subsurface horizon or zone of bentonite, which is considered a &quot;lode&quot; deposit. Opals which have weathered out of the &quot;in situ&quot; deposits are alluvial and considered placer deposits. Miocene-age opalised teeth, bones, fish, and a snake head have been found. Some of the opal has high water content and may desiccate and crack when dried. The largest producing mines of Virgin Valley have been the famous Rainbow Ridge, Royal Peacock, Bonanza, Opal Queen, and WRT Stonetree/Black Beauty mines. The largest unpolished black opal in the Smithsonian Institution, known as the &quot;Roebling opal&quot;, came out of the tunneled portion of the Rainbow Ridge Mine in 1917, and weighs . The largest polished black opal in the Smithsonian Institution comes from the Royal Peacock opal mine in the Virgin Valley, weighing , known as the &quot;Black Peacock&quot;.

=== Mexico ===

Fire opal is a transparent to translucent opal with warm body colors of yellow to orange to red. Although fire opals don&#x27;t usually show any play of color, they occasionally exhibit bright green flashes. The most famous source of fire opals is the state of Querétaro in Mexico; these opals are commonly called Mexican fire opals. Fire opals that do not show a play of color are sometimes referred to as jelly opals. Mexican opals are sometimes cut in their rhyolitic host material if it is hard enough to allow cutting and polishing. This type of Mexican opal is referred to as a Cantera opal. Another type of opal from Mexico, referred to as Mexican water opal, is a colorless opal that exhibits either a bluish or golden internal sheen.
Opal occurs in significant quantity and variety in central Mexico, where mining and production first originated in the state of Querétaro. In this region the opal deposits are located mainly in the mountain ranges of three municipalities: Colón, Tequisquiapan, and Ezequiel Montes. During the 1960s through to the mid-1970s, the Querétaro mines were heavily mined. Today&#x27;s opal miners report that it was much easier to find quality opals with a lot of fire and play of color back then, whereas today the gem-quality opals are very hard to come by and command hundreds of US dollars or more. The orange-red background color is characteristic of all &quot;fire opals,&quot; including &quot;Mexican fire opal&quot;.

The oldest mine in Querétaro is Santa Maria del Iris. This mine was opened around 1870 and has been reopened at least 28 times since. At the moment there are about 100 mines in the regions around Querétaro, but most of them are now closed. The best quality of opals came from the mine Santa Maria del Iris, followed by La Hacienda la Esperanza, Fuentezuelas, La Carbonera, and La Trinidad. Important deposits in the state of Jalisco were not discovered until the late 1950s.

In 1957, Alfonso Ramirez (of Querétaro) accidentally discovered the first opal mine in Jalisco: La Unica, located on the outer area of the volcano of Tequila, near the Huitzicilapan farm in Magdalena. By 1960 there were around 500 known opal mines in this region alone. Other regions of the country that also produce opals (of lesser quality) are Guerrero, which produces an opaque opal similar to the opals from Australia (some of these opals are carefully treated with heat to improve their colors so high-quality opals from this area may be suspect). There are also some small opal mines in Morelos, Durango, Chihuahua, Baja California, Guanajuato, Puebla, Michoacán, and Estado de México.

=== Other locations ===
Another source of white base opal or creamy opal in the United States is Spencer, Idaho. A high percentage of the opal found there occurs in thin layers.

Other significant deposits of precious opal around the world can be found in the Czech Republic, Canada, Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil (in Pedro II, Piauí), Honduras (more precisely in Erandique), Guatemala, and Nicaragua.

In late 2008, NASA announced the discovery of opal deposits on Mars.

== Fossil opal ==
Wood opal, also known as xylopal, is a form of opal, as well as a type of petrified wood which has developed an opalescent sheen or, more rarely, where the wood has been completely replaced by opal. 
Other names for this opalized sheen-like wood are opalized wood and opalized petrified wood. It is often used as a gemstone.

== Synthetic opal ==

Opals of all varieties have been synthesized experimentally and commercially. The discovery of the ordered sphere structure of precious opal led to its synthesis by Pierre Gilson in 1974. The resulting material is distinguishable from natural opal by its regularity; under magnification, the patches of color are seen to be arranged in a &quot;lizard skin&quot; or &quot;chicken wire&quot; pattern. Furthermore, synthetic opals do not fluoresce under ultraviolet light. Synthetics are also generally lower in density and are often highly porous.

Opals which have been created in a laboratory are often termed &quot;lab-created opals&quot;, which, while classifiable as man-made and synthetic, are very different from their resin-based counterparts which are also considered man-made and synthetic. The term &quot;synthetic&quot; implies that a stone has been created to be chemically and structurally indistinguishable from a genuine one, and genuine opal contains no resins or polymers. The finest modern lab-created opals do not exhibit the lizard skin or columnar patterning of earlier lab-created varieties, and their patterns are non-directional. They can still be distinguished from genuine opals, however, by their lack of inclusions and the absence of any surrounding non-opal matrix. While many genuine opals are cut and polished without a matrix, the presence of irregularities in their play-of-color continues to mark them as distinct from even the best lab-created synthetics.

Other research in macroporous structures have yielded highly ordered materials that have similar optical properties to opals and have been used in cosmetics. Synthetic opals are also deeply investigated in photonics for sensing and light management purposes.

== Local atomic structure ==

The lattice of spheres of opal that cause interference with light is several hundred times larger than the fundamental structure of crystalline silica. As a mineraloid, no unit cell describes the structure of opal. Nevertheless, opals can be roughly divided into those that show no signs of crystalline order (amorphous opal) and those that show signs of the beginning of crystalline order, commonly termed cryptocrystalline or microcrystalline opal. Dehydration experiments and infrared spectroscopy have shown that most of the H2O in the formula of SiO2·&quot;n&quot;H2O of opals is present in the familiar form of clusters of molecular water. Isolated water molecules, and silanols, structures such as SiOH, generally form a lesser proportion of the total and can reside near the surface or in defects inside the opal.

The structure of low-pressure polymorphs of anhydrous silica consists of frameworks of fully corner bonded tetrahedra of SiO4. The higher temperature polymorphs of silica cristobalite and tridymite are frequently the first to crystallize from amorphous anhydrous silica, and the local structures of microcrystalline opals also appear to be closer to that of cristobalite and tridymite than to quartz. The structures of tridymite and cristobalite are closely related and can be described as hexagonal and cubic close-packed layers. It is therefore possible to have intermediate structures in which the layers are not regularly stacked.

=== Microcrystalline opal ===
Microcrystalline opal or &quot;Opal-CT&quot; has been interpreted as consisting of clusters of stacked cristobalite and tridymite over very short length scales. The spheres of opal in microcrystalline opal are themselves made up of tiny nanocrystalline blades of cristobalite and tridymite. Microcrystalline opal has occasionally been further subdivided in the literature. Water content may be as high as 10 wt%. Opal-CT, also called &quot;lussatine&quot; or &quot;lussatite&quot;, is interpreted as consisting of localized order of α-cristobalite with a lot of stacking disorder. Typical water content is about 1.5 wt%.

=== Noncrystalline opal ===
Two broad categories of noncrystalline opals, sometimes just referred to as &quot;opal-A&quot; (&quot;A&quot; stands for &quot;amorphous&quot;), have been proposed. The first of these is opal-AG consisting of aggregated spheres of silica, with water filling the space in between. Precious opal and potch opal are generally varieties of this, the difference being in the regularity of the sizes of the spheres and their packing. The second &quot;opal-A&quot; is opal-AN or water-containing amorphous silica-glass. Hyalite is another name for this.

Noncrystalline silica in siliceous sediments is reported to gradually transform to opal-CT and then opal-C as a result of diagenesis, due to the increasing overburden pressure in sedimentary rocks, as some of the stacking disorder is removed.

===Opal surface chemical groups===
The surface of opal in contact with water is covered by siloxane bonds (≡Si–O–Si≡) and silanol groups (≡Si–OH). This makes the opal surface very hydrophilic and capable of forming numerous hydrogen bonds.

== Etymology ==
The word &#x27;opal&#x27; is adapted from the Latin term . The origin of this word in turn is a matter of debate, but most modern references suggest it is adapted from the Sanskrit word meaning ‘precious stone’.

As references to the gem are made by Pliny the Elder, one theory attributed the name&#x27;s origin to Roman mythology: to have been adapted from Ops, the wife of Saturn, and goddess of fertility. (The portion of Saturnalia devoted to Ops was &quot;Opalia&quot;, similar to .)

Another common claim was that the term was adapted from the Ancient Greek word, . This word has two meanings, one is related to &quot;seeing&quot; and forms the basis of the English words like &quot;opaque&quot;; the other is &quot;other&quot; as in &quot;alias&quot; and &quot;alter&quot;. It is claimed that combined these uses, meaning &quot;to see a change in color&quot;. However, historians have noted the first appearances of do not occur until after the Romans had taken over the Greek states in 180 BC and they had previously used the term .

However, the argument for the Sanskrit origin is strong. The term first appears in Roman references around 250 BC, at a time when the opal was valued above all other gems. The opals were supplied by traders from the Bosporus, who claimed the gems were being supplied from India. Before this, the stone was referred to by a variety of names, but these fell from use after 250 BC.

== Historical superstitions ==
In the Middle Ages, opal was considered a stone that could provide great luck because it was believed to possess all the virtues of each gemstone whose color was represented in the color spectrum of the opal. It was also said to grant invisibility if wrapped in a fresh bay leaf and held in the hand. As a result, the opal was seen as the patron gemstone for thieves during the medieval period. Following the publication of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Anne of Geierstein&quot; in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott&#x27;s novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal talisman with supernatural powers. When a drop of holy water falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott&#x27;s novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death. Within a year of the publishing of Scott&#x27;s novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.

Even as recently as the beginning of the 20th century, it was believed that when a Russian saw an opal among other goods offered for sale, he or she should not buy anything more, as the opal was believed to embody the evil eye.

Opal is considered the birthstone for people born in October.

<text>Alice Miller (born Alicja Englard; 12 January 1923 – 14 April 2010) was a Polish-Swiss psychologist, psychoanalyst and philosopher of Jewish origin, who is noted for her books on parental child abuse, translated into several languages. She was also a noted public intellectual.

Her book &quot;The Drama of the Gifted Child&quot; caused a sensation and became an international bestseller upon the English publication in 1981. Her views on the consequences of child abuse became highly influential. In her books she departed from psychoanalysis, charging it with being similar to the poisonous pedagogies.

==Life==
Miller was born in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland into a Jewish family. She was the oldest daughter of Gutta and Meylech Englard and had a sister, Irena, who was five years younger. From 1931 to 1933 the family lived in Berlin, where nine-year-old Alicja learned the German language. Due to the National Socialists&#x27; seizure of power in Germany in 1933 the family turned back to Piotrków Trybunalski. As a young woman, Miller managed to escape the Jewish Ghetto in Piotrków Trybunalski, where all Jewish inhabitants were interned since October 1939, and survived World War II in Warsaw under the assumed name of Alicja Rostowska. While she was able to smuggle her mother and sister out, in 1941, her father died in the ghetto.

She retained her assumed name Alice Rostowska when she moved to Switzerland in 1946, where she had won a scholarship to the University of Basel.

In 1949 she married Swiss sociologist Andreas Miller, originally a Polish Catholic, with whom she had moved from Poland to Switzerland as students. They divorced in 1973. They had two children, Martin (born 1950) and Julika (born 1956). Shortly after his mother&#x27;s death Martin Miller stated in an interview with Der Spiegel that he had been beaten by his authoritarian father during his childhood - in the presence of his mother. Miller stated that his mother did not intervene and was emotionally abusive. Martin also mentioned that his mother was unable to talk with him, despite numerous lengthy conversations, about her wartime experiences, as she was severely burdened by them.

In 1953 Miller got her doctorate in philosophy, psychology and sociology. Between 1953 and 1960, Miller studied psychoanalysis and practiced it between 1960 and 1980 in Zürich.

In 1980, after having worked as a psychoanalyst and an analyst trainer for 20 years, Miller &quot;stopped practicing and teaching psychoanalysis in order to explore childhood systematically.&quot; She became critical of both Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Her first three books originated from research she took upon herself as a response to what she felt were major in her field. However, by the time her fourth book was published, she no longer believed that psychoanalysis was viable in any respect.

In 1985 Miller wrote about the research from her time as a psychoanalyst: &quot;For twenty years I observed people denying their childhood traumas, idealising their parents and resisting the truth about their childhood by any means.&quot; In 1985 she left Switzerland and moved to Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in Southern France.

In 1986, she was awarded the Janusz Korczak Literary Award for her book &quot;Thou Shalt Not Be Aware: Society&#x27;s Betrayal of the Child&quot;.

In April 1987 Miller announced in an interview with the German magazine &quot;Psychologie Heute&quot; (Psychology Today) her rejection of psychoanalysis. The following year she cancelled her memberships in both the Swiss Psychoanalytic Society and the International Psychoanalytic Association, because she felt that psychoanalytic theory and practice made it impossible for former victims of child abuse to recognise the violations inflicted on them and to resolve the consequences of the abuse, as they &quot;remained in the old tradition of blaming the child and protecting the parents&quot;.

One of Miller&#x27;s last books, &quot;Bilder meines Lebens&quot; (&quot;Pictures of My Life&quot;), was published in 2006. It is an informal autobiography in which the writer explores her emotional process from painful childhood, through the development of her theories and later insights, told via the display and discussion of 66 of her original paintings, painted in the years 1973–2005.

Between 2005 and her death in 2010, she answered hundreds of readers&#x27; letters on her website, where there are also published articles, flyers and interviews in three languages. Days before her death Alice Miller wrote: &quot;These letters will stay as an important witness also after my death under my copyright&quot;.

Miller died on 14 April 2010, at the age of 87, at her home in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence by suicide after severe illness and diagnosis of advanced-stage pancreatic cancer.

==Work==
Miller extended the trauma model to include all forms of child abuse, including those that were commonly accepted (such as spanking), which she called &quot;poisonous pedagogy&quot;, a non-literal translation of Katharina Rutschky&#x27;s &quot;Schwarze Pädagogik&quot; (black or dark pedagogy/imprinting).

Drawing upon the work of psychohistory, Miller analyzed writers Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka and others to find links between their childhood traumas and the course and outcome of their lives.

The introduction to the first chapter in Miller&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Drama of the Gifted Child&quot;, first published in 1979, contains a line that summarises her core view. In it, she writes:

In the 1990s, Miller strongly supported a new method developed by Konrad Stettbacher, who himself was later charged with incidents of sexual abuse. Miller learned of Stettbacher and his method from a book by Mariella Mehr titled &quot;Steinzeit&quot; (Stone Age). Having been strongly impressed by the book, Miller contacted Mehr in order to get the name of the therapist. From that time forward, Miller refused to make therapist or method recommendations. In open letters, Miller explained her decision and how she originally became Stettbacher&#x27;s disciple, but in the end she distanced herself from him and his regressive therapies.

In her writings, Miller is careful to clarify that by &quot;abuse&quot; she does not only mean physical violence or sexual abuse, she is also concerned with psychological abuse perpetrated by one or both parents on their child; this is difficult to identify and deal with because the abused person is likely to conceal it from themselves and may not be aware of it until some event, or the onset of depression, requires it to be treated. Miller blamed psychologically abusive parents for the majority of neuroses and psychoses. She maintained that all instances of mental illness, addiction, crime and cultism were ultimately caused by suppressed rage and pain as a result of subconscious childhood trauma that was not resolved emotionally, assisted by a helper, which she came to term an &quot;enlightened witness.&quot; In all cultures, &quot;sparing the parents is our supreme law,&quot; wrote Miller. Even psychiatrists, psychoanalysts and clinical psychologists were unconsciously afraid to blame parents for the mental disorders of their clients, she contended. According to Miller, mental health professionals were also creatures of the poisonous pedagogy internalised in their own childhood. This explained why the Commandment &quot;Honor thy parents&quot; was one of the main targets in Miller&#x27;s school of psychology.

Miller called electroconvulsive therapy &quot;a campaign against the act of remembering&quot;. In her book &quot;Abbruch der Schweigemauer&quot; (The Demolition of Silence), she also criticised psychotherapists&#x27; advice to clients to forgive their abusive parents, arguing that this could only hinder recovery through remembering and feeling childhood pain. It was her contention that the majority of therapists fear this truth and that they work under the influence of interpretations culled from both Western and Oriental religions, which preach forgiveness by the once-mistreated child. She believed that forgiveness did not resolve hatred, but covered it in a dangerous way in the grown adult: displacement on scapegoats, as she discussed in her psycho-biographies of Adolf Hitler and Jürgen Bartsch, both of whom she described as having suffered severe parental abuse.

A common denominator in Miller&#x27;s writings is her explanation of why human beings prefer not to know about their own victimisation during childhood: to avoid unbearable pain. She believed that the unconscious command of the individual, not to be aware of how they were treated in childhood, led to displacement: the irresistible drive to repeat abusive parenting in the next generation of children or direct unconsciously the unresolved trauma against others (war, terrorism, delinquency), or against themselves (eating disorders, drug addiction, depression).

===The roots of violence===

According to Alice Miller, worldwide violence has its roots in the fact that children are beaten all over the world, especially during their first years of life, when their brains become structured. She said that the damage caused by this practice is devastating, but unfortunately hardly noticed by society. She argued that as children are forbidden to defend themselves against the violence inflicted on them, they must suppress the natural reactions like rage and fear, and they discharge these strong emotions later as adults against their own children or whole peoples: &quot;child abuse like beating and humiliating not only produces unhappy and confused children, not only destructive teenagers and abusive parents, but thus also a confused, irrationally functioning society&quot;. Miller stated that only through becoming aware of this dynamic can we break the chain of violence.

==Writings==
The following is a brief summary of Miller&#x27;s books.

===&quot;The Drama of the Gifted Child&quot;===

In her first book (also published under the titles &quot;Prisoners of Childhood&quot; and &quot;The Drama of Being a Child&quot;), Miller defined and elaborated the personality manifestations of childhood trauma. She addressed the two reactions to the loss of love in childhood, depression and grandiosity; the inner prison, the vicious circle of contempt, repressed memories, the etiology of depression, and how childhood trauma manifests itself in the adult.

Miller writes:

&quot;Quite often I have been faced with patients who have been praised and admired for their talents and their achievements. According to prevailing, general attitudes these peoplethe pride of their parentsshould have had a strong stable sense of self-assurance. But exactly the opposite is the case… In my work with these people, I found that every one of them has a childhood history that seems significant to me:
* There was a &quot;mother&quot; who at the core was emotionally insecure, and who depended for her narcissistic equilibrium on the child behaving, or acting, in a particular way. This mother was able to hide her insecurity from the child and from everyone else behind a hard, authoritarian and even totalitarian façade.
* This child had an amazing ability to perceive and respond intuitively, that is, unconsciously, to this need of the mother or of both parents, for him to take on the role that had unconsciously been assigned to him.
* This role secured &quot;love&quot; for the childthat is, his parents&#x27; exploitation. He could sense that he was needed, and this need, guaranteed him a measure of existential security.
This ability is then extended and perfected. Later, these children not only become mothers (confidantes, advisers, supporters) of their own mothers, but also take over the responsibility for their siblings and eventually develop a special sensitivity to unconscious signals manifesting the needs of others.&quot;

===&quot;For Your Own Good&quot;===

Miller proposed here that German traumatic childrearing produced heroin addict Christiane F., serial killer of children Jürgen Bartsch, and dictator Adolf Hitler. Children learn to accept their parents&#x27; often abusive behaviour against themselves as being &quot;for their own good.&quot; In the case of Hitler, it led to displacement against the Jews and other minority groups. For Miller, the traditional pedagogic process of spanking was manipulative, resulting in grown-up adults deferring excessively to authorities, even to tyrannical leaders or dictators, like Hitler. Miller even argued for abandoning the term &quot;pedagogy&quot; in favour of the word &quot;support,&quot; something akin to what psychohistorians call the helping mode of parenting.

In the Poisonous Pedagogy section of the book, Miller does a thorough survey of 19th century child-rearing literature in the book, citing texts which recommend practices such as exposing children to dead bodies in order to teach them about the sexual functions of human anatomy (45–46), resisting the temptation to comfort screaming infants (41–43), and beating children who haven&#x27;t committed any specific offense as a kind of conditioning that would help them to understand their own evil and fallen nature.

The key element that Miller elucidated in this book was the understanding of why the German nation, the &quot;good Germans,&quot; were compliant with Hitler&#x27;s abusive regime, which Miller asserted was a direct result of how the society in general treated its children. She raised fundamental questions about current, worldwide child-rearing practices and issued a stern warning.

===&quot;Thou Shalt Not Be Aware&quot; ===

Unlike Miller&#x27;s later books, this one is written in a semi-academic style. It was her first critique of psychoanalysis, charging it with being similar to the poisonous pedagogies, which she described in &quot;For Your Own Good&quot;. Miller was critical of both Freud and Carl Jung. She scrutinised Freud&#x27;s drive theory, a device that, according to her and Jeffrey Masson, blames the child for the abusive sexual behaviour of adults. Miller also theorised about Franz Kafka, who was abused by his father but fulfilled the politically correct function of mirroring abuse in metaphorical novels, instead of exposing it.

In the chapter entitled &quot;The Pain of Separation and Autonomy,&quot; Miller examined the authoritarian (e.g.: Old Testament, Papist, Calvinist) interpretation of Judeo-Christian theism and its parallels to modern parenting practice, asserting that it was Jesus&#x27;s father Joseph who should be credited with Jesus&#x27;s departure from the dogmatic Judaism of his time.

&quot;Pictures of Childhood&quot; 

The Untouched Key 

This book was partly a psychobiography of Nietzsche, Picasso, Kollwitz and Buster Keaton; (in Miller&#x27;s later book, &quot;The Body Never Lies&quot;, published in 2005, she included similar analyses of Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, Schiller, Rimbaud, Mishima, Proust and James Joyce).

According to Miller, Nietzsche did not experience a loving family and his philosophical output was a metaphor of an unconscious drive against his family&#x27;s oppressive theological tradition. She believed that the philosophical system was flawed because Nietzsche was unable to make emotional contact with the abused child inside him. Though Nietzsche was severely punished by a father who lost his mind when Nietzsche was a little boy, Miller did not accept the genetic theory of madness. She interpreted Nietzsche&#x27;s psychotic breakdown as the result of a family tradition of Prussian modes of child-rearing.

===&quot;Banished Knowledge&quot;===

In this more personal book Miller said that she herself was abused as a child. She also introduced the fundamental concept of &quot;enlightened witness&quot;: a person who was willing to support a harmed individual, empathise with her and help her to gain understanding of her own biographical past.

&quot;Banished Knowledge&quot; is autobiographical in another sense. It is a pointer in Miller&#x27;s thoroughgoing apostasy from her own profession—psychoanalysis. She believed society was colluding with Freud&#x27;s theories in order to not know the truth about our childhood, a truth that human cultures have &quot;banished.&quot; She concluded that the feelings of guilt instilled in our minds since our most tender years reinforce our repression even in the psychoanalytic profession.

===&quot;Breaking Down the Wall of Silence&quot; ===
Written in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Miller took to task the entirety of human culture. What she called the &quot;wall of silence&quot; is the metaphorical wall behind which society — academia, psychiatrists, clergy, politicians and members of the media — has sought to protect itself: denying the mind-destroying effects of child abuse. She also continued the autobiographical confession initiated in &quot;Banished Knowledge&quot; about her abusive mother. In &quot;Pictures of a Childhood: Sixty-six Watercolours and an Essay&quot;, Miller said that painting helped her to ponder deeply into her memories. In some of her paintings, Miller depicted baby Alice as swaddled, sometimes by an evil mother.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary of 26 April 2010 British psychologist Oliver James is quoted saying that Alice Miller &quot;is almost as influential as R.D. Laing.&quot;

<text>Benjamin McLane Spock (May 2, 1903–March 15, 1998), widely known as Dr. Spock, was an American pediatrician and left-wing political activist. His book &quot;Baby and Child Care&quot; (1946) is one of the best-selling books of the 20th century, selling 500,000 copies in the six months after its initial publication and 50 million by the time of Spock&#x27;s death in 1998. The book&#x27;s premise told mothers, &quot;You know more than you think you do.&quot; Dr. Spock was widely regarded as a trusted source for parenting advice in his generation.

Spock was the first pediatrician to study psychoanalysis in an effort to understand children&#x27;s needs and family dynamics. His ideas influenced several generations of parents, encouraging them to be more flexible and affectionate with their children and to treat them as individuals. However, his theories were widely criticized by colleagues for relying heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than serious academic research.

After undergoing a self-described &quot;conversion to socialism,&quot; Spock became an activist in the New Left and anti-Vietnam War movements during the 1960s and early 1970s, culminating in his run for President of the United States as the People&#x27;s Party nominee in 1972. He campaigned on a maximum wage, legalized abortion, and withdrawing troops from all foreign countries. His books were criticized by conservatives for propagating permissiveness and an expectation of instant gratification, a charge that Spock denied.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===


Benjamin McLane Spock was born May 2, 1903, in New Haven, Connecticut. His parents were Benjamin Ives Spock, Yale graduate and long-time general counsel of the New Haven Railroad, and Mildred Louise (Stoughton) Spock. The family name had Dutch origins; they originally spelled it &quot;Spaak&quot; before migrating to the former colony of New Netherland. Spock was one of six children, including his younger sister, environmentalist writer Marjorie Spock.

Spock attended Hamden Hall Country Day School, and went on to attend his father&#x27;s alma maters Phillips Andover Academy and Yale University. He studied literature and history at Yale; the lanky 6&#x27; 4&quot; Spock was also active in college rowing. Eventually, he joined the Olympic rowing crew (Men&#x27;s Eights) that won a gold medal at the 1924 games in Paris. At Yale, he was inducted into the Eta chapter of the Zeta Psi fraternity and the senior society Scroll and Key. He attended the Yale School of Medicine for two years before shifting to Columbia University&#x27;s College of Physicians and Surgeons, from which he graduated first in his class in 1929. By that time, he had married Jane Cheney.

=== Personal life ===
Jane Cheney and Spock were married in 1927. Jane assisted Spock in the research and writing of &quot;Dr. Spock&#x27;s Baby &amp; Child Care&quot;, published in 1946 by Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce as &quot;The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care.&quot; The book has sold more than 50 million copies in 42 languages.

Jane Cheney Spock was a civil liberties advocate and mother of two sons. She was born in Manchester, Connecticut, and attended Bryn Mawr College. She was active in Americans for Democratic Action, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. The Spocks divorced in 1976. Cheney went on to organize and run support groups for older divorced women.

In 1976, Spock married Mary Morgan. They built a home on Beaver Lake in Arkansas where Spock would row daily. Mary quickly adapted to Spock&#x27;s life of travel and political activism, and was arrested with him many times for civil disobedience. Once they were arrested in Washington, D.C. for praying on the White House lawn. Morgan was strip-searched; Spock was not. Morgan sued the jail and the mayor of Washington, D.C. for sex discrimination. The ACLU took the case and won.

For most of his life, Spock wore Brooks Brothers suits and shirts with detachable collars, but at 75, for the first time in his life, Mary got him to try blue jeans. She joined him in meditation twice a day and introduced him to Transactional analysis (TA) therapists, massage, yoga and a macrobiotic diet which reportedly improved his health. &quot;She gave me back my youth,&quot; Spock was quoted as saying. He adapted to her lifestyle, as she did to his. There were 40 years difference in their ages, but Spock would tell reporters they were both 16. Mary scheduled speaking dates and handled legal agreements for the 5th through 9th editions of &quot;Baby and Child Care&quot;. She continues to publish the book with co-author Robert Needlman.

For many years, Spock lived aboard his sailboat, the &quot;Carapace,&quot; in the British Virgin Islands off Tortola. At 84, Spock won third place in a rowing contest, crossing four miles (6.4 km) of the Sir Francis Drake Channel between Tortola and Norman Island in 2.5 hours. He credited his strength and good health to his lifestyle and his love for life. Spock had a second sailboat named &quot;Turtle&quot;, which he lived aboard and sailed in Maine in the summers. The Spocks lived only on boats for most of 20 years.

By 1991, Spock was unable to walk without assistance and was reported as infirm shortly before his death. At the very end of Spock&#x27;s life, he was advised to come ashore by his physician, Steve Pauker, of New England Medical Center, Boston. In 1992, Spock received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library for his lifelong commitment to disarmament and peaceable child-rearing.

Spock had two sons.

Spock died at a house he was renting in La Jolla, California, on March 15, 1998. His ashes were buried in Rockport, Maine, where he spent his summers.

==Books==
In 1946, Spock published &quot;The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care&quot;, which became a best-seller. Its message to parents is &quot;You know more than you think you do.&quot; By 1998, it had sold more than 50 million copies, and had been translated into 42 languages. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Baby and Child Care&quot; was, throughout its first 52 years, the second-best-selling book, next to the Bible. According to other sources, it was among best-sellers, albeit not second-best-selling.

Spock advocated ideas about parenting that were considered out of the mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts (such as Truby King) had told parents babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them when they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to sleep through the night (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong, independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast, Spock encouraged parents to show affection for their children and to see them as individuals.

By the late 1960s, however, Spock&#x27;s opposition to the Vietnam War had damaged his reputation. The 1968 edition of &quot;Baby and Child Care&quot; sold half as many copies of the prior edition. Later in life, Spock wrote &quot;Dr. Spock on Vietnam&quot; and co-wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;Spock on Spock&quot; (with wife Mary Morgan Spock), in which he stated his attitude toward aging: &quot;Delay and Deny&quot;.

In the seventh edition of &quot;Baby and Child Care&quot; published shortly after he died, Spock advocated for a bold change in children&#x27;s diets, recommending children switch to a vegan diet after age 2. Spock himself had switched to an all-plant diet in 1991 after a series of illnesses that left him weak and unable to walk unaided. After making the dietary change, he lost 50 pounds, regained his ability to walk and became healthier overall. The revised edition stated children on an all-plant diet will reduce their risk of developing heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain diet-related cancers. However, Spock&#x27;s recommendations were criticized as being irresponsible towards children&#x27;s health and children&#x27;s ability to sustain normal growth, which has been aided with minerals such as calcium, riboflavin, vitamin D, iron, zinc and at times protein.

Spock&#x27;s approach to childhood nutrition was criticized by a number of experts, including co-author Boston pediatrician Steven J. Parker, as too extreme and likely to result in nutritional deficiencies unless it was carefully planned and executed, which would be difficult for working parents. T. Berry Brazelton, Boston City Hospital pediatrician who specialized in child behavior (and longtime admirer and friend of Dr. Spock), called the dietary recommendations &quot;absolutely insane.&quot; Neal Barnard, president of Physicians for Responsible Medicine, a Washington organization advocating strict vegetarian diets, acknowledged he drafted the nutrition section in the 1998 edition of &quot;Baby and Child Care,&quot; but said Spock edited it to give it &quot;his personal touch.&quot; It was acknowledged that in Spock&#x27;s final years, he had strokes, bouts with pneumonia and a heart attack.

==Views==

===Sudden infant death syndrome===
Spock advocated that infants should not sleep on their backs, commenting in his 1958 edition that &quot;if [an infant] vomits, he&#x27;s more likely to choke on the vomitus.&quot; This advice was extremely influential on healthcare providers, with nearly unanimous support through the 1990s. Later empirical studies, however, found a significantly increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) associated with infants sleeping on their abdomens. Advocates of evidence-based medicine have used this as an example of the importance of basing healthcare recommendations on statistical evidence. One researcher estimated that as many as 50,000 infant deaths in Europe, Australia, and the U.S. could have been prevented had this advice been changed by 1970 when such evidence became available.

===Male circumcision===
In the 1940s, Spock favored circumcision of males performed within a few days of birth. However, in the 1976 revision of &quot;Baby and Child Care&quot; he concurred with a 1971 American Academy of Pediatrics task force that there was no medical reason to recommend routine circumcision, and in a 1989 article for &quot;Redbook&quot; he stated that &quot;circumcision of males is traumatic, painful, and of questionable value.&quot; He received the first Human Rights Award from the International Symposium on Circumcision (ISC) in 1991 and was quoted as saying, &quot;My own preference, if I had the good fortune to have another son, would be to leave his little penis alone.&quot;

==Social and political activism==
In 1962, Spock joined The Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, otherwise known as SANE. Spock was politically outspoken and active in the movement to end the Vietnam War. In 1968, he and four others (including William Sloane Coffin, Marcus Raskin, Mitchell Goodman, and Michael Ferber) were singled out for prosecution by then Attorney General Ramsey Clark on charges of conspiracy to counsel, aid, and abet resistance to the draft. Spock and three of his alleged co-conspirators were convicted, although the five had never been in the same room together. His two-year prison sentence was never served; the case was appealed, and in 1969 a federal court set aside his conviction.

In 1967, Spock was pressed to run as Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s vice-presidential running mate at the National Conference for New Politics over Labor Day weekend in Chicago. In April of that year, Spock helped lead the largest anti-war protest to date, the Spring Mobilization Against the War. Spock wore a suit and held a sign that read &quot;Children are not born to burn.&quot;

In 1968, Spock signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War, and he later became a sponsor of the War Tax Resistance project, which practiced and advocated tax resistance as a form of anti-war protest. He was also arrested for his involvement in anti-war protests resulting from his signing of the anti-war manifesto &quot;A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority&quot; circulated by members of the radical intellectual collective RESIST. The individuals arrested during this incident came to be known as the Boston Five.

In 1968, the American Humanist Association named Spock Humanist of the Year. On 15 October 1969, Spock was a featured speaker at the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam march.

In 1970, Dr. Benjamin Spock was active in The New Party serving as Honorary co-chairman with Gore Vidal. In the 1972 United States presidential election, Spock was the People&#x27;s Party candidate with a platform that called for free medical care; the repeal of &quot;victimless crime&quot; laws, including the legalization of abortion, homosexuality, and cannabis; a guaranteed minimum income for families; and for an end to American military interventionism and the immediate withdrawal of all American troops from foreign countries. In the 1970s and 1980s, Spock demonstrated and gave lectures against nuclear weapons and cuts in social welfare programs.

In 1972, Spock, Julius Hobson (his vice presidential candidate), Linda Jenness (Socialist Workers Party presidential candidate), and Socialist Workers Party vice presidential candidate Andrew Pulley wrote to Major General Bert A. David, commanding officer of Fort Dix, asking for permission to distribute campaign literature and to hold an election-related campaign meeting. On the basis of Fort Dix regulations 210-26 and 210–27, General David refused the request. Spock, Hobson, Jenness, Pulley, and others then filed a case that ultimately made its way to the United States Supreme Court (424 U.S. 828—&quot;Greer, Commander, Fort Dix Military Reservation, et al., v. Spock et al.&quot;), which ruled against the plaintiffs.

Spock was the People&#x27;s Party and the Peace and Freedom Party nominee in 1976 for vice president as the running mate of Margaret Wright.

===Conservative backlash===
Preacher Norman Vincent Peale supported the Vietnam War and, in the late 1960s, criticized the anti-war movement and the perceived laxity of that era, blaming Dr. Spock&#x27;s books: &quot;The U.S. was paying the price of two generations that followed the Dr. Spock baby plan of instant gratification of needs.&quot;

In the 1960s and 1970s, Spock was also blamed for the disorderliness of young people, many of whose parents had been devotees of &quot;Baby and Child Care&quot;. Vice President Spiro Agnew also blamed Spock for &quot;permissiveness&quot;. These allegations were enthusiastically embraced by conservative adults, who viewed the rebellious youth of that era with disapproval, referring to them as &quot;the Spock generation&quot;.

Spock&#x27;s supporters countered that these criticisms betrayed an ignorance of what Spock had actually written, and/or a political bias against Spock&#x27;s left-wing political activities. Spock himself, in his autobiography, said he had never advocated permissiveness; also, the attacks and claims that he had ruined American youth only arose after his public opposition to the Vietnam War. He regarded these claims as ad hominem attacks, whose political motivation and nature were clear.

Spock addressed these accusations in the first chapter of his 1994 book, &quot;Rebuilding American Family Values: A Better World for Our Children.&quot;
In June 1992, Spock told Associated Press journalist David Beard there was a link between pediatrics and political activism: 

Conservatives also criticized Spock for being interested in the ideas of Sigmund Freud and John Dewey and his efforts to integrate their philosophies into the general population. Spock wrote: 

==Olympic success==
Spock was part of the all-Yale Men&#x27;s eight rowing team at the 1924 Summer Olympics, captained by James Rockefeller (later president of what would become Citigroup). Competing on the Seine, the team won the gold medal.

==Pop culture references==
&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; mentions Dr. Spock twice. In &quot;Nursery School,&quot; Lucy quotes a sentence from his child care book out of context to justify her not sending Little Ricky to nursery school. Ricky then reads the rest of the passage, all of which applies to Little Ricky&#x27;s home life situation, causing Lucy to ask, &quot;&quot;Well, what does he know?&quot; Ricky then asserts that he and &quot;Dr. &quot;Spook&quot;&quot; agree about nursery school. Lucy corrects Ricky and asks how Spock knew this, and was he ever a mother.

In &quot;Little Ricky&#x27;s School Pageant,&quot; when Lucy and Ricky discuss Little Ricky&#x27;s role in a school play, Ricky tells Lucy that it&#x27;s more important that their son learn to cooperate with others than have a big part in the play. Lucy then calls her husband a Cuban Dr. Spock.

In 1997&#x27;s &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot;, Martin Short&#x27;s character sarcastically compares Tim Allen&#x27;s character to Spock when he gives him parenting advice.

<text>The Los Angeles Xtreme was a professional American football team based in Los Angeles, California. The team was a member of the original version of the XFL, begun by Vince McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment and by NBC, a major television network in the United States. The team played its home games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in the spring of 2001. They were in the XFL&#x27;s Western Division with the San Francisco Demons, the Memphis Maniax, and the Las Vegas Outlaws. The team had the league&#x27;s best passing offense and was nicknamed &quot;L.A.X.&quot; as a pun on the IATA code for Los Angeles International Airport. They finished the season in 1st place with a 7–3 record and defeated the Chicago Enforcers in the Playoffs and the San Francisco Demons in the Million Dollar Game with a score of 38–6 to win the league&#x27;s sole Championship.

==History==
The LA Xtreme were the sole champions of the original XFL because NBC dropped the XFL concept after the first season due to dismal ratings. Shortly after this, McMahon announced that the league would be dissolved. However, the Xtreme&#x27;s quarterback, Tommy Maddox, subsequently caught on with the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League, later leading them into the playoffs in 2002 and winning a Super Bowl ring in 2005. Maddox also won the XFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award. Jeremaine Copeland has achieved success in the CFL with the Montreal Alouettes, the Calgary Stampeders, and the Toronto Argonauts winning two Grey Cup championships.

===Revival===
In December 2018, a revival of the XFL announced its intention to return to Los Angeles. The new team was named the Los Angeles Wildcats, but would cease operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic; they would not return when the league was reactivated in 2023.

<doc id="54533" wikidata="Q9640" url="?curid=54533" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">
<text>Lyndon Baines Johnson (; August 27, 1908January 22, 1973), also known as LBJ, was the 36th president of the United States, serving from 1963 to 1969. He became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, under whom he had served as the 37th vice president from 1961 to 1963. A Southern Democrat, Johnson previously represented Texas in Congress for over 23 years, first as a U.S. representative from 1937 to 1949, and then as a U.S. senator from 1949 to 1961.

Born in Stonewall, Texas, Johnson worked as a teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937. In 1948, he was controversially declared the winner in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate election in Texas before winning the general election. He became Senate majority whip in 1951, Senate Democratic leader in 1953 and majority leader in 1954. Senator Kennedy bested Johnson and his other rivals for the 1960 Democratic presidential nomination before surprising many by offering to make Johnson his vice presidential running mate. The Kennedy–Johnson ticket won the general election. Vice President Johnson assumed the presidency in 1963, after President Kennedy was assassinated. The following year, Johnson was elected to the presidency in a landslide, winning the largest share of the popular vote for the Democratic Party in history, and the highest for any candidate since the advent of widespread popular elections in the 1820s.

Johnson&#x27;s Great Society was aimed at expanding civil rights, public broadcasting, access to health care, aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development, consumer protection, environmentalism, and public services. He sought to create better living conditions for low-income Americans by spearheading the war on poverty. As part of these efforts, Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which resulted in the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Johnson made the Apollo program a national priority; enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965, which established federally insured student loans; and signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which laid the groundwork for U.S. immigration policy today. Johnson&#x27;s stance on civil rights put him at odds with other white Southern Democrats. His civil rights legacy was shaped by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Due to his domestic agenda, Johnson&#x27;s presidency marked the peak of modern American liberalism in the 20th century. Johnson&#x27;s foreign policy prioritized containment of communism, including in the ongoing Vietnam War.

Johnson began his presidency with near-universal support, but his approval declined throughout his presidency as the public became frustrated with both the Vietnam War and domestic unrest, including race riots in major cities, increasing public skepticism with his reports and policies (coined the &quot;credibility gap&quot;), and increasing crime. Johnson initially sought to run for re-election in 1968; however, following disappointing results in the New Hampshire primary, he withdrew his candidacy. Johnson retired to his Texas ranch and kept a low public profile until he died in 1973. Public opinion and academic assessments of Johnson&#x27;s legacy have fluctuated greatly. Historians and scholars rank Johnson in the upper tier for his accomplishments regarding domestic policy. His administration passed many major laws that made substantial changes in civil rights, health care, welfare, and education. Conversely, Johnson is heavily criticized for his foreign policy, namely escalating American involvement in the Vietnam War.
==Early life==

Lyndon Baines Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, near Stonewall, Texas, in a small farmhouse on the Pedernales River. He was the eldest of five children born to Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr. and Rebekah Baines. Johnson wasn&#x27;t given a name until he was three months old, as his parents couldn&#x27;t agree on a name that both liked. Finally, he was named after &quot;criminal lawyer—a county lawyer&quot; W. C. Linden, who his father liked; his mother agreed on the condition of spelling it as Lyndon. Johnson had one brother, Sam Houston Johnson, and three sisters, Rebekah, Josefa, and Lucia. Through his mother, he was a great-grandson of Baptist clergyman George Washington Baines.

Johnson&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr., was raised Baptist and for a time was a member of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). In his later years, Samuel Sr. became a Christadelphian; Samuel Jr. also joined the Christadelphian Church toward the end of his life. Johnson was influenced in his positive attitude toward Jews by the religious beliefs that his family, especially his grandfather, had shared with him.

Johnson grew up poor, with his father losing a great deal of money. Biographer Robert Caro described him as being raised &quot;in a land without electricity, where the soil was so rocky that it was hard to earn a living from it.&quot;

In school, Johnson was a talkative youth who was elected president of his 11th-grade class. He graduated in 1924 from Johnson City High School, where he participated in public speaking, debate, and baseball. At 15, Johnson was the youngest in his class. Pressured by his parents to attend college, he enrolled at a &quot;sub college&quot; of Southwest Texas State Teachers College (SWTSTC) in the summer of 1924, where students from unaccredited high schools could take the 12th-grade courses needed for admission to college. He left the school just weeks after his arrival and decided to move to California. He worked at his cousin&#x27;s legal practice and in odd jobs before returning to Texas, where he worked as a day laborer.

In 1926, Johnson enrolled at SWTSTC. He worked his way through school, participated in debate and campus politics, and edited the school newspaper, &quot;The College Star&quot;. The college years refined his skills of persuasion and political organization. For nine months, from 1928 to 1929, Johnson paused his studies to teach Mexican–American children at the segregated Welhausen School in Cotulla, Texas, south of San Antonio. The job helped him to save money to complete his education, and he graduated in 1930 with a Bachelor of Science in history and his certificate of qualification as a high school teacher. He briefly taught at Pearsall High School in Pearsall, Texas before taking a position teaching public speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston.

When he returned to San Marcos in 1965, after signing the Higher Education Act of 1965, Johnson reminisced:

==Entry into politics==
After Richard M. Kleberg won a 1931 special election to represent Texas in the United States House of Representatives, he appointed Johnson as his legislative secretary. This marked Johnson&#x27;s formal introduction to politics. Johnson secured the position on the recommendation of his father and that of state senator Welly Hopkins, for whom Johnson had campaigned in 1930. Kleberg had little interest in the day-to-day duties of a Congressman, instead delegating them to Johnson. After Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 1932 U.S. presidential election, Johnson became a lifelong supporter of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. Johnson was elected speaker of the &quot;Little Congress&quot;, a group of Congressional aides, where he cultivated Congressmen, newspapermen, and lobbyists. Johnson&#x27;s friends soon included aides to President Roosevelt as well as fellow Texans such as vice president John Nance Garner and congressman Sam Rayburn.

In 1935, Johnson was appointed head of the Texas National Youth Administration, which enabled him to create government-funded education and job opportunities for young people. He resigned two years later to run for Congress. A notoriously tough boss, Johnson often demanded long workdays and work on weekends. He was described by friends, fellow politicians, and historians as motivated by lust for power and control. As Caro observes, &quot;Johnson&#x27;s ambition was uncommonin the degree to which it was unencumbered by even the slightest excess weight of ideology, of philosophy, of principles, of beliefs.&quot;

==U.S. House of Representatives (1937–1949)==

In 1937, after the death of 13-term congressman James P. Buchanan, Johnson successfully campaigned in a special election for Texas&#x27;s 10th congressional district, which included Austin and the surrounding Texas Hill Country. He ran on a New Deal platform and was effectively aided by his wife. He served as a U.S. Representative from April 10, 1937, to January 3, 1949. President Roosevelt found Johnson to be a political ally and conduit for information, particularly regarding the internal politics of Texas and the machinations of Vice President John Nance Garner and House Speaker Sam Rayburn. Johnson was immediately appointed to the Naval Affairs Committee. He worked hard for rural electrification, getting approval to complete the hydroelectric Mansfield Dam on the Colorado River near Austin. Johnson also sponsored projects that gave his Texas district soil conservation, public housing, lower railroad freight rates, and expanded credit for loans to farmers. He steered the projects towards contractors he knew, such as Herman and George Brown, who financed much of Johnson&#x27;s future career.

During this time Johnson maintained a hostile position towards civil rights legislation like almost all other Southern Democrat legislators; voting against anti-lynching legislation, anti-poll tax legislation and the Fair Employment Practice Committee.

=== 1941 U.S. Senate election ===

In April 1941, incumbent U.S. Senator Morris Sheppard from Texas died. Under Texas law, a special election for a vacant Senate seat must be held within a few months of the vacancy, meaning that the election would not be held during a normal November election, giving Johnson the chance to run without forfeiting his seat in the House. The election would be held without party primaries, and with no runoff, meaning that Johnson would have to compete against every Democrat — without the chance of facing the frontrunner, Governor W. Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel, in a 1-on-1 runoff election. The first pre-election polls showed Johnson receiving only 5% of the vote, but Johnson ran a fierce campaign, barnstorming the state and emphasizing his close relationship with President Roosevelt.

On Election Day, Johnson held a strong lead in the returns throughout the whole night, and with 96 percent of the ballots counted, Johnson held a 5,000-vote lead. According to John Connally, future Governor and Johnson&#x27;s campaign manager, local election officials began calling Connally&#x27;s office and asking him about whether they should report the vote tallies. Connally told them to report the votes, which allegedly allowed O&#x27;Daniel&#x27;s political allies among the South and East Texas party bosses to know the exact number of fraudulent votes needed for O&#x27;Daniel to catch up to Johnson. According to Connally, The opposition then Governor O&#x27;Daniel and his people knew exactly how many votes they had to have to take the lead... They kept changing the results, and our lead got smaller and smaller and smaller. Finally, on Wednesday afternoon, we wound up on the short side of the stick and lost the election by 1,311 votes. I&#x27;m basically responsible for losing that 1941 campaign. We let them know exactly how many votes they had to have. In addition to O&#x27;Daniel&#x27;s allies, state business interests aligned with former impeached and convicted Texas Governor &quot;Pa&quot; Ferguson had been concerned with O&#x27;Daniel&#x27;s support of prohibition as Governor; they believed that he could do much less damage to their cause in the Senate. The lieutenant governor, Coke R. Stevenson, was not in favor of prohibition, making his possible promotion to Governor a key selling point for the state&#x27;s business interests in manipulating the election results. In the final vote tally, Johnson fell short by just 0.23% of the vote.

While Johnson&#x27;s loss in the 1941 Senate race was a stinging defeat, he did not have to give up his seat in the House, which permitted him to maintain numerous allies, including George Berham Parr, who ran a political machine in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. U.S. Senator W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel became unpopular during his time in the Senate, and decided to forgo a bid for re-election in 1948, so Johnson began preparing for a close Senate runoff by arranging for his supporters who controlled votes, including Parr, to withhold their final tallies until the statewide results were announced. By waiting until the statewide result was reported, Johnson was able to know the figure he had to surpass and so could add as many votes as necessary to his total. It would prove consequential, as Johnson would win the Democratic primary in 1948 by just 87 votes.

===Active military duty (1941–1942)===

Johnson was appointed a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve on June 21, 1940. While serving as a U.S. representative, he was called to active duty three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. His first orders were to report to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, D.C., for instruction and training. Following his training, Johnson asked Undersecretary of the Navy James Forrestal for a job in Washington, D.C. He was instead sent to inspect shipyard facilities in Texas and on the West Coast. In the spring of 1942, President Roosevelt decided he needed better information on conditions in the Southwest Pacific, and wanted a trusted political ally to obtain it. Forrestal suggested Johnson. Roosevelt assigned Johnson to a three-man survey team covering the Southwest Pacific.

Johnson reported to General Douglas MacArthur in Australia. Johnson and two U.S. Army officers went to the 22nd Bomb Group base, which was assigned the high-risk mission of bombing the Japanese airbase at Lae in New Guinea. On June 9, 1942, Johnson volunteered as an observer for an airstrike on New Guinea. Reports vary on what happened to the aircraft carrying Johnson during that mission. MacArthur recommended Johnson for the Silver Star for gallantry in action; the citation indicated that the mission came under attack and Johnson&#x27;s aircraft experienced mechanical problems, forcing it to turn back before reaching its objective. Others claim that the aircraft turned back because of generator trouble before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire, an account that is supported by the aircraft&#x27;s official flight records. Other airplanes that continued came under fire near the target about the same time Johnson&#x27;s plane was recorded as having landed back at the original airbase. Johnson&#x27;s biographer Robert Caro was quoted as saying &quot;I think that the weight of the evidence at this moment is that the plane was attacked by Zeroes and that he was cool under fire&quot;, but also &quot;The fact is, LBJ never got within sight of Japanese forces. His combat experience was a myth.&quot;

Johnson used a movie camera to record conditions, and reported to Roosevelt, Navy leaders, and Congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable. Some historians have suggested this was in exchange for MacArthur&#x27;s recommendation to award the Silver Star. He argued that the southwest Pacific urgently needed a higher priority and a larger share of war supplies. Warplanes that were sent there were &quot;far inferior&quot; to Japanese planes, and U.S. Navy morale there was poor. Johnson told Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a &quot;critical&quot; need for 6,800 additional experienced men. Johnson prepared a twelve-point program to upgrade the effort in the region, stressing &quot;greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters&quot;. Congress responded by making Johnson chairman of a high-powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee, with a mission similar to that of the Truman Committee in the Senate. He probed the peacetime &quot;business as usual&quot; inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals get the job done. Johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often; organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him. Johnson&#x27;s biographer Robert Dallek concludes, &quot;The mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy Johnson&#x27;s personal and political wishes, but it also represented a genuine effort on his part, however misplaced, to improve the lot of America&#x27;s fighting men.&quot;

In addition to the Silver Star, Johnson received the American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. He was discharged from active duty on July 17, 1942, but remained in the Navy Reserve, where he was promoted to commander on October 19, 1949, effective June 2, 1948. He resigned from the Navy Reserve effective January 18, 1964.

==U.S. Senate (1949–1961)==

===1948 U.S. Senate election===
In 1948, Johnson again ran for the U.S. Senate and won the general election after being declared winner in a highly controversial Democratic Party primary election against the well-known former governor Coke Stevenson. Johnson drew crowds to fairgrounds with his rented Sikorsky S-51 helicopter, dubbed &quot;The Johnson City Windmill&quot;. He raised money to flood the state with campaign circulars and won over conservatives by casting doubts on Stevenson&#x27;s support for the Taft–Hartley Act (curbing union power). Stevenson came in first in the primary but lacked a majority, so a runoff election was held; Johnson campaigned harder, while Stevenson&#x27;s efforts slumped due to a lack of funds.

The runoff vote count, handled by the Democratic State Central Committee, took a week. Johnson was announced the winner by 87 votes out of 988,295, an extremely narrow margin. However, Johnson&#x27;s victory was based on 200 &quot;patently fraudulent&quot; ballots reported six days after the election from Box 13 in Jim Wells County, in an area dominated by political boss George Parr. The added names were in alphabetical order and written with the same pen and handwriting, at the end of the list of voters. Some on this part of the list insisted that they had not voted that day. Election judge Luis Salas said in 1977 that he had certified 202 fraudulent ballots, 200 for Johnson, and two for Stevenson. Robert Caro made the case in his 1990 book that Johnson had stolen the election in Jim Wells County, and that there were thousands of fraudulent votes in other counties as well, including 10,000 votes switched in San Antonio. The Democratic State Central Committee voted to certify Johnson&#x27;s nomination by a majority of one (29–28). The state Democratic convention upheld Johnson. Stevenson went to court, eventually taking his case before the U.S. Supreme Court, but with timely help from his friend and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, Johnson prevailed on the basis that jurisdiction over naming a nominee rested with the party, not the federal government. Johnson soundly defeated Republican Jack Porter in the general election in November and went to Washington, permanently dubbed &quot;Landslide Lyndon&quot;. Johnson, dismissive of his critics, happily adopted the nickname.

===Freshman senator to majority whip===
During his two terms in the Senate, Johnson drifted rightward. He felt he had to tread carefully lest he offend politically powerful conservative oil and gas interests in Texas, and in part to curry favor with the chamber&#x27;s powerful southern chairmen, most notably Senator Richard Russell, Democrat from Georgia and leader of the Southern Caucus within the Conservative coalition that dominated the Senate. With Russell&#x27;s support, Johnson won election as Democratic whip in 1951, serving in this capacity until 1953. While serving as whip, Johnson increased his ability to persuade people to reach agreement.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, he was chairman of the Senate subcommittee that refused the re-nomination of Leland Olds as Chairman of the Federal Power Commission on the grounds that he had been sympathetic towards Communism.

Johnson was appointed to the Senate Armed Services Committee, and became increasingly concerned with the country&#x27;s military preparedness in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. He became chairman of the Senate Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee, and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency. After the Korean War began in 1950, he called for more troops and for improved weapons. Johnson ensured that every report was endorsed unanimously by his committee. He used his political influence in the Senate to receive broadcast licenses from the Federal Communications Commission in his wife&#x27;s name.

===Senate Democratic leader===

In the 1952 elections, Republicans won a majority in both the House and Senate. In January 1953, Johnson was chosen by his fellow Democrats as Senate Minority Leader; he became the most junior senator ever elected to this position. He reformed the seniority system so that Democratic senators, including freshmen, were more likely to receive a committee assignment that closely aligned with their expertise rather than an assignment based solely on their seniority.

====Senate Majority Leader====

In 1954, Johnson was re-elected to the Senate and, with Democrats winning the majority in the Senate, he became majority leader. President Dwight D. Eisenhower found Johnson more cooperative than the Senate Republican leader, William F. Knowland of California. Particularly on foreign policy, Johnson offered bipartisan support to the president.

Historians Caro and Dallek consider Johnson the most effective Senate majority leader ever. He was unusually proficient at gathering information. One biographer suggests he was &quot;the greatest intelligence gatherer Washington has ever known&quot;, discovering exactly where every senator stood on issues, his philosophy and prejudices, his strengths and weaknesses, and what it took to get his vote. Bobby Baker claimed that Johnson would occasionally send senators on NATO trips so they were absent and unable to cast dissenting votes. Central to Johnson&#x27;s control was &quot;The Treatment&quot;, described by two journalists:
In 1956, during the Suez Crisis, Johnson tried to prevent the U.S. government from criticizing Israel for its invasion of the Sinai Peninsula. Along with much of the rest of the nation, Johnson was appalled by the threat of possible Soviet domination of space exploration implied by the launch of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot;, the first artificial Earth satellite, and used his influence to ensure passage of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which established NASA. Johnson helped establish the Senate Aeronautical and Space Committee, and made himself its first chairman.

During his tenure as Majority Leader, Johnson did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and shepherded the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 to passage the first civil rights bills to pass Congress since the Enforcement Acts and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 during Reconstruction. Johnson negotiated a middle course between Northern liberal senators and the Southern bloc of senators who had opposed such legislation by removing key enforcement provisions, such as Title III, which authorized the attorney general to initiate civil action for preventive relief in a wide range of civil rights matters. Being a Southerner was seen as an impossible barrier for a presidential candidate and towards the end of his Senate career as well as not signing the Southern Manifesto, he distanced himself further from the Southern Caucus in 1959 by joining the Democrat&#x27;s Western regional conference.

==Campaigns of 1960==

In 1960, Johnson&#x27;s success in the Senate rendered him a potential Democratic presidential candidate. James H. Rowe repeatedly urged Johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959, but Johnson thought it was better to wait, thinking that Senator John F. Kennedy&#x27;s candidacy would create a division in the ranks that could then be exploited. Johnson&#x27;s strategy was to sit out the primaries and to rely on his legislative record as Senate Majority Leader, the support of Southern Democrats, and the favors owed by Democratic senators to him and by Democratic representatives to his close ally Sam Rayburn, the Speaker of the House.
In July 1960, Johnson finally entered the campaign. Johnson&#x27;s late entry, coupled with his reluctance to leave Washington, D.C., allowed rival John F. Kennedy to secure a substantial early lead in securing support from Democratic state party officials. Johnson underestimated Kennedy&#x27;s endearing charm and intelligence in comparison to his perceived crude and wheeling-dealing &quot;Landslide Lyndon&quot; style. Caro suggests that Johnson&#x27;s hesitancy to enter the race resulted from his fear of losing.

Johnson attempted in vain to capitalize on Kennedy&#x27;s youth, poor health, and failure to take a position regarding McCarthyism. He had formed a &quot;Stop Kennedy&quot; coalition with Adlai Stevenson, Stuart Symington, and Hubert Humphrey, but it proved a failure. Despite Johnson having the support of established Democrats and the party leadership, this did not translate into popular approval. Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention to Kennedy&#x27;s 806, and so the convention nominated Kennedy. Tip O&#x27;Neill was a representative from Kennedy&#x27;s home state of Massachusetts at that time, and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said, &quot;Tip, I know you have to support Kennedy at the start, but I&#x27;d like to have you with me on the second ballot.&quot; O&#x27;Neill replied, &quot;Senator, there&#x27;s not going to be any second ballot.&quot;

===Vice presidential nomination===
After much discussion with party leaders and others, Kennedy offered Johnson the vice presidential nomination at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel on July 14, the morning after Kennedy was nominated, and Johnson accepted. From that point to the actual nomination that evening, several facts are in dispute, including whether convention chairman LeRoy Collins&#x27; had the two-thirds majority required to begin the convention&#x27;s proceedings. Kennedy&#x27;s choice of Johnson as his running mate was intended to attract Southern votes. Kennedy was a liberal Bostonian and a Roman Catholic. Johnson was more conservative, a Southerner, and a member of the Disciples of Christ. Nevertheless, labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to Johnson. AFL-CIO president George Meany called Johnson &quot;the arch-foe of labor&quot;, and Illinois AFL-CIO president Reuben Soderstrom asserted Kennedy had &quot;made chumps out of leaders of the American labor movement&quot;.

===Re-election to U.S. Senate===
At the same time as his vice presidential run, Johnson also sought a third term in the U.S. Senate. According to Robert Caro: Johnson won an election for both the vice presidency of the United States, on the Kennedy–Johnson ticket, and for a third term as senator (he had Texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices). When he won the vice presidency, he made arrangements to resign from the Senate, as he was required to do under federal law, as soon as it convened on January 3, 1961. Johnson was re-elected senator with 1,306,605 votes (58 percent) to Republican John Tower&#x27;s 927,653 (41.1 percent). Fellow Democrat William A. Blakley was appointed to replace Johnson, but lost a special election in May 1961 to Tower.

==Vice presidency (1961–1963)==

After the election, Johnson was concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office and sought authority not allotted to him as vice president. He initially sought a transfer of the authority of Senate majority leader to the vice presidency, since that office made him president of the Senate, but faced vehement opposition from the Democratic Caucus, including members whom he had counted as his supporters.

Johnson sought to increase his influence within the executive branch. He drafted an executive order for Kennedy&#x27;s signature, granting Johnson &quot;general supervision&quot; over matters of national security, and requiring all government agencies to &quot;cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments&quot;. Kennedy&#x27;s response was to sign a non-binding letter requesting Johnson to &quot;review&quot; national security policies instead. Kennedy similarly turned down early requests from Johnson to be given an office adjacent to the Oval Office and to employ a full-time staff within the White House. In 1961, Kennedy appointed Johnson&#x27;s friend Sarah T. Hughes to a federal judgeship. Johnson tried but failed to have Hughes nominated at the beginning of his vice presidency. House Speaker Sam Rayburn wrangled the appointment from Kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill.

Many members of the Kennedy White House were openly contemptuous of Johnson, including the president&#x27;s brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and they ridiculed his comparatively brusque and crude manner. Then Congressman Tip O&#x27;Neill recalled that the Kennedy brothers &quot;had a disdain for Johnson that they didn&#x27;t even try to hide... They actually took pride in snubbing him.&quot;

Kennedy made efforts to keep Johnson busy and informed, telling aides, &quot;I can&#x27;t afford to have my vice president, who knows every reporter in Washington, going around saying we&#x27;re all screwed up, so we&#x27;re going to keep him happy.&quot; Kennedy appointed him to jobs such as the head of the President&#x27;s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities, where Johnson worked with African Americans and other minorities. Kennedy may have intended this to remain a nominal position, but Taylor Branch contends in his book &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; that Johnson pushed the Kennedy administration&#x27;s actions further and faster for civil rights than Kennedy originally intended.

Johnson went on multiple minor diplomatic missions, which gave him some insights into global issues and opportunities for self-promotion. During his visit to West Berlin on August 19–20, 1961, Johnson sought to calm Berliners who were outraged by the building of the Berlin Wall. He also attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings. Kennedy gave Johnson control over all presidential appointments involving Texas, and appointed him chairman of the President&#x27;s Ad Hoc Committee for Science.

Kennedy also appointed Johnson Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The Soviets beat the United States with the first crewed spaceflight in April 1961, and Kennedy gave Johnson the task of evaluating the U.S. space program and recommending a project that would allow the United States to catch up or beat the Soviets. Johnson recommended that the United States gain the leadership role by committing to landing an American on the Moon in the 1960s. Kennedy assigned priority to the space program, but Johnson&#x27;s appointment provided cover in case of a failure.

In August 1963, Johnson was touched by a Senate scandal when Bobby Baker, the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a protégé of Johnson&#x27;s, came under investigation by the Senate Rules Committee for alleged bribery and financial malfeasance. One witness alleged that Baker arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the Vice President. Baker resigned in October, and the investigation did not expand to Johnson. The negative publicity, however, fed rumors in Washington circles that Kennedy was planning on dropping Johnson from the Democratic ticket in the 1964 presidential election. However, on October 31, 1963, a reporter asked if he intended and expected to retain Johnson on the ticket. Kennedy replied, &quot;Yes to both those questions.&quot; There is little doubt that Robert Kennedy and Johnson hated each other, yet John and Robert Kennedy agreed that dropping Johnson from the ticket could produce heavy losses in the South.

==Presidency (1963–1969)==
===Succession===

President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Later that day, Johnson took the presidential oath of office aboard &quot;Air Force One&quot;. Cecil Stoughton&#x27;s iconic photograph of Johnson taking the oath of office as Mrs. Kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft. Johnson was sworn in by District Court judge Sarah T. Hughes and is to date the only president in U.S. history to be sworn in by a woman.

Johnson was convinced of the need to make an immediate show of transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation. He and the Secret Service, not knowing whether the assassin acted alone or as part of a broader conspiracy, felt compelled to return rapidly to Washington, D.C.; this was greeted by some with assertions that he was in too much haste to assume power. In response to the public demand for answers and the growing number of conspiracy theories, Johnson established a commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, known as the Warren Commission, to investigate Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. The commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination.
When Johnson assumed office, he asked the existing Cabinet to remain in place. Despite his notoriously poor relationship with Johnson, Robert F. Kennedy stayed on as Attorney General until September 1964, when he resigned to run for the U.S. Senate. Four of the Kennedy cabinet members Johnson inherited—Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, Secretary of Agriculture Orville L. Freeman, and Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz—served until the end of Johnson&#x27;s presidency. Other Kennedy holdovers, including Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, left office during Johnson&#x27;s tenure. Although Johnson had no official chief of staff, Walter Jenkins presided over daily operations at the White House. George Reedy, who was Johnson&#x27;s second-longest-serving aide, assumed the post of press secretary when John F. Kennedy&#x27;s own Pierre Salinger left that post in March 1964. Horace Busby served primarily as a speechwriter and political analyst. Bill Moyers handled scheduling and speechwriting part-time.

===Taxation and budget===
The new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy&#x27;s primary legislative goals a tax cut. Johnson worked closely with Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below $100 billion in exchange for what became overwhelming Senate approval of the Revenue Act of 1964. The act cut individual income tax rates across the board by approximately 20 percent, cut the top marginal tax rate from 91 to 70 percent, and slightly reduced corporate tax rates. Passage of the long-stalled tax cut facilitated efforts to move ahead on civil rights legislation. Despite a period of strong economic growth, heavy spending on the Vietnam War and on domestic programs contributed to a rising budget deficit, as well as a period of inflation that would continue into the 1970s. To counter this, Johnson reluctantly signed a second tax bill, the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968, which included a mix of tax increases and spending cuts, producing a budget surplus.

===Civil Rights Act of 1964===
On November 27, 1963, Johnson delivered his &quot;Let Us Continue&quot; speech to Congress, saying that &quot;No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy&#x27;s memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long.&quot; The wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to Johnson&#x27;s promise to carry out Kennedy&#x27;s plans.

Johnson asked Robert Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking on Capitol Hill. This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail, but if it were successful, Johnson would receive ample credit. Biographer Caro notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past: Southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote. In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, to force the bill&#x27;s supporters to pull it. For Johnson&#x27;s civil rights bill to reach the House floor for a vote, the president needed to find a way to circumvent Representative Howard W. Smith, the chairman of the House Rules Committee. Johnson used a discharge petition to force it onto the House floor. Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed, the Rules Committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full House, which soon passed it by a vote of 290–110. Johnson convinced Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield to put the House bill directly into consideration by the full Senate, bypassing the Senate Judiciary Committee and its segregationist chairman James Eastland. Since bottling up the civil rights bill in a committee was no longer an option, the anti-civil rights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool. Overcoming the filibuster required the support of at least 20 Republicans, who were growing less supportive because their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill. According to Caro, Johnson ultimately could convince Republican leader Everett Dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964; the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 71–29.

Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on July 2. The act outlawed discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. It prohibits racial segregation in public accommodations and employment discrimination, and strengthened the federal government&#x27;s power to investigate racial and gender employment discrimination. The following evening, Johnson told aide Bill Moyers, &quot;I think we may have lost the South for your lifetime – and mine&quot;, anticipating a backlash from Southern whites against Johnson&#x27;s Democratic Party.

===Great Society===
By early 1964, Johnson had begun to use the name &quot;Great Society&quot; to describe his domestic program. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society program encompassed movements of urban renewal, modern transportation, clean environment, anti-poverty, healthcare reform, crime control, and educational reform. To ensure the passage of his programs, Johnson placed an unprecedented emphasis on relations with Congress.

===1964 presidential election===
In Spring 1964, Johnson was not optimistic about his prospects of being elected president. A pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding. Johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike. After considerable horse-trading, especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances from the Internal Revenue Service, Johnson obtained an agreement. This substantially boosted his self-confidence and image.

Robert F. Kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice for Johnson&#x27;s vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy had never liked each other, and Johnson, afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, consistently opposed the idea. Kennedy was undecided about accepting an offer as Johnson&#x27;s running mate, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson. Barry Goldwater&#x27;s poor polling numbers was perceived as reducing the political significance of Johnson&#x27;s selection of a running mate. Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast. Knowing the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president, Johnson put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his loyalty. Having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.

In preparation for the Democratic convention in Atlantic City, Johnson requested the FBI send 30 agents to cover convention activities; the objective of the squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities. The squad&#x27;s focus narrowed upon the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) delegation, which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state. The squad&#x27;s activities included wiretaps of Martin Luther King&#x27;s room and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). From beginning to end, the squad&#x27;s assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other high-ranking officials.

Johnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the MFDP and the segregationist delegation, and he assigned Humphrey to manage the problem. The convention&#x27;s Credentials Committee declared that two MFDP delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to &quot;bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote because of their race or color&quot;. The MFDP rejected the committee&#x27;s ruling. The convention became the apparent personal triumph that Johnson craved, but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the MFDP would trigger disaffection with Johnson and the Democratic Party from the left; SNCC chairman John Lewis would call it a &quot;turning point in the civil rights movement&quot;.
Early in the 1964 presidential campaign, Barry Goldwater appeared to be a strong contender, with strong support from the South, which threatened Johnson&#x27;s position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act. However, Goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed. On September 7, 1964, Johnson&#x27;s campaign managers broadcast the &quot;Daisy ad&quot;: it portrayed a little girl picking petals from a daisy, followed by a countdown and explosion of a nuclear bomb. The message conveyed was that electing Goldwater risked a nuclear war. Goldwater&#x27;s campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming &quot;In your heart, you know he&#x27;s right&quot;. Opponents captured the spirit of Johnson&#x27;s campaign with bumper stickers that said &quot;In your heart, you know he might&quot; and &quot;In your guts, you know he&#x27;s nuts&quot;. CIA Director William Colby asserted that Tracy Barnes instructed the CIA to spy on the Goldwater campaign and the Republican National Committee to provide information to Johnson&#x27;s campaign. Johnson won the presidency by a landslide with 61.05 percent of the vote, making it the highest ever share of the popular vote. At the time, this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century more than 15.95 million votes this was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon&#x27;s victory in 1972. In the Electoral College, Johnson defeated Goldwater by a margin of 486 to 52. Johnson won 44 states, compared to Goldwater&#x27;s six. Voters also gave Johnson the largest majorities in Congress since FDR&#x27;s election in 1936 a Senate with a 68–32 majority and a House with a 295–140 Democratic margin.

===Voting Rights Act===
Soon after the 1964 election, civil rights organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) began a push for federal action to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. On March 7, 1965, these organizations began the Selma to Montgomery marches in which Selma residents proceeded to march to Alabama&#x27;s capital, Montgomery, to highlight voting rights issues and present Governor George Wallace with their grievances. On the first march, demonstrators were stopped by state and county police, who shot tear gas into the crowd and trampled protesters. Televised footage of the scene, which became known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, generated outrage across the country. In response to the rapidly increasing political pressure upon him, Johnson decided to immediately send voting rights legislation to Congress, and to address the American people in a speech before a Joint session of Congress. He began:

Johnson and Dirksen established a strong bipartisan alliance in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, precluding the possibility of a Senate filibuster defeating the bill. In August 1965, the House approved the bill by a vote of 333 to 85, and Senate passed the bill by a vote of 79 to 18. The landmark legislation outlawed discrimination in voting, thus allowing millions of Southern blacks to vote for the first time. The results were significant; between the years of 1968 and 1980, the number of Southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled. In Mississippi, the voter registration rate of African Americans rose from 6.7 percent to 59.8 percent between 1964 and 1967, a reflection of a broader increase in African-American voter registration rates.

After the murder of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo, Johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four Ku Klux Klans men implicated in her death. He angrily denounced the Klan as a &quot;hooded society of bigots,&quot; and warned them to &quot;return to a decent society before it&#x27;s too late&quot;. Johnson was the first president to arrest and prosecute members of the Klan since Ulysses S. Grant. He turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights, mobilizing support from churches. At the Howard University commencement address on June 4, 1965, he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve these goals: &quot;To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin. To dissolve, as best we can, the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder, divide the great democracy, and do wrong great wrong to the children of God ...&quot;

===Fair Housing Act===

The Fair Housing Act, a component of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, outlawed several forms of housing discrimination and effectively allowed many African Americans to move to the suburbs. Johnson submitted a bill to Congress in April 1966 that barred house owners from refusing to enter into agreements on the basis of race; the bill immediately garnered opposition from many of the Northerners who had supported the last two major civil rights bills. Though a version of the bill passed the House, it failed to win Senate approval, marking Johnson&#x27;s first major legislative defeat. The law gained new impetus after the April 4, 1968, assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and the civil unrest across the country that followed. The bill passed Congress on April 10 and was quickly signed into law by Johnson.

===&quot;War on Poverty&quot;===

In his 1964 State of the Union Address Johnson stated, &quot;this administration today, here and now, declares an unconditional war on poverty in America. Our aim is not only to relieve the symptoms of poverty but to cure it–and above all, to prevent it.&quot; In April 1964, Johnson proposed the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which would create the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) to oversee local Community Action Agencies (CAA) charged with dispensing aid to those in poverty. Each CAA was required to have &quot;maximum feasible participation&quot; from local residents, who would design and operate antipoverty programs unique to their communities&#x27; needs. This was threatening to local political regimes who saw CAAs as alternative power structures in their own communities, funded and encouraged by the OEO. In 1967, the Green Amendment gave city governments the right to decide which entity would be the official CAA for their community. The net result was a halt to the citizen participation reform movement.

The Economic Opportunity Act created the Job Corps and AmeriCorps VISTA, a domestic version of the Peace Corps. Modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), Job Corps was a residential education and job-training program that provided academic and vocational skills to low-income at-risk young people. VISTA deployed volunteers on community projects across the nation to address issues such as illiteracy, inadequate housing, and poor health. By the end of 1965, 2,000 volunteers had signed on. The act reflected Johnson&#x27;s belief that the government could best help the impoverished by providing them with economic opportunities.

During the Johnson administration, national poverty declined significantly, with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 to 12 percent. Johnson took an additional step in the War on Poverty with an urban renewal effort, the &quot;Demonstration Cities Program&quot;. To be eligible, a city was required to demonstrate its readiness to &quot;arrest blight and decay and make a substantial impact on the development of its entire city&quot;. Johnson requested an investment of $400 million per year totaling $2.4 billion. In late 1966, Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing $900 million, which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote 22 years later that the program was largely a failure.

===Healthcare reform===
Johnson&#x27;s initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Strokes (HDCS). These diseases accounted for 71 percent of the nation&#x27;s deaths in 1962.

In 1965, Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security. The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Representative Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. To reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as three layers: hospital insurance under Social Security; a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits; and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated, but the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28. Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans.

===Immigration===
The sweeping Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 reformed the country&#x27;s immigration system and repealed the National Origins Formula, which had restricted emigration from countries outside of Western Europe and the Western Hemisphere. The annual rate of inflow doubled between 1965 and 1970, and doubled again by 1990, with dramatic increases from Asia and Latin America, including Mexico. Scholars give Johnson little credit for the law, which was not one of his priorities; he had supported the McCarren–Walter Act of 1952, which proved unpopular with reformers.

===Federal funding for education===


Johnson, whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, believed that education was an essential component of the American dream, especially for minorities. He made education the top priority of the Great Society agenda, with an emphasis on helping poor children. Buoyed by his landslide victory in the 1964 election, in early 1965 Johnson proposed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which would double federal spending on education from $4 billion to $8 billion. The bill quickly passed both houses of Congress by wide margins. ESEA increased funding to all school districts, but directed more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families.

Although ESEA solidified Johnson&#x27;s support among K–12 teachers&#x27; unions, neither the Higher Education Act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in Vietnam. Johnson&#x27;s second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965, which increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships, gave low-interest loans to students, and established a Teacher Corps. Johnson also established Head Start, an early education program to help prepare children from disadvantaged families for success in public schools. In 1967, Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act to create educational television programs to supplement broadcast networks.

In 1965, Johnson set up the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts, to support the study of literature, history, and law, and arts such as music, painting, and sculpture.

===Transportation===

In March 1966, Johnson sent to Congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new Transportation Department, comprising the Commerce Department&#x27;s Office of Transportation, the Bureau of Public Roads, the Federal Aviation Agency, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The bill passed the Senate after some negotiation over navigation projects; in the House, passage required negotiation over maritime interests and the bill was signed October 15, 1965.

===Environment===
During his tenure as president, Johnson signed over 300 conservation measures into law, forming the legal basis of the modern environmental movement. He signed into law the Clean Air Act of 1963, which had been proposed by President Kennedy. The Clean Air Act set emission standards for stationary emitters of air pollutants and directed federal funding to air quality research. In 1965, the act was amended by the Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act, which directed the federal government to establish and enforce national standards for controlling the emission of pollutants from new motor vehicles and engines. In September 1964, Johnson signed the Wilderness Act, which established the National Wilderness Preservation System (preserving 9.1 million acres of forestland from industrial development), and signed a law establishing the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which aids the purchase of land used for federal and state parks.

In 1965, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson took the lead in calling for passage of the Highway Beautification Act. The act called for control of outdoor advertising, including removal of certain types of signs, along the nation&#x27;s growing Interstate Highway System and the existing federal-aid primary highway system. It also required certain junkyards along Interstate or primary highways to be removed or screened and encouraged scenic enhancement and roadside development.

===Gun control===
Though Johnson had already introduced a gun control bill on June 6, 1968, after the assassination of Robert Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson&#x27;s press secretary Liz Carpenter, in a memo to the president, worried that the country had been &quot;brainwashed by high drama,&quot; and that Johnson &quot;need[ed] some quick dramatic actions&quot; that addressed &quot;the issue of violence.&quot; In October, Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968, but did not invoke the memory of Robert Kennedy as he had so often done with his brother–an omission historian Jeff Shesol has argued was motivated by Johnson&#x27;s longstanding contempt for Robert. The measure prohibited convicted felons, drug users, and the mentally ill from purchasing handguns and raised record-keeping and licensing requirements. It also banned mail order sales of rifles and shotguns.

===Urban riots===


The nation experienced a series of &quot;long hot summers&quot; of civil unrest during the Johnson years. They started with the Harlem riots in 1964, and the Watts district of Los Angeles in 1965. The momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt following the riots in Watts. After 34 people were killed and $35 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in property was damaged, the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities, and so the appetite for additional programs in Johnson&#x27;s agenda was lost.

In what is known as the &quot;Long hot summer of 1967&quot;, more than 150 riots erupted across the United States. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; called it &quot;a revolution of black Americans against white Americans, a violent petition for the redress of long-standing grievances.&quot; The Newark riots left 26 dead and 1,500 injured. The Detroit riot resulted in 43 deaths, 2250 injuries, 4,000 arrests, and millions of dollars&#x27; worth of property damage. Governor George Romney sent in 7,400 national guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. At an August 2, 1967, cabinet meeting, Attorney General Ramsey Clark warned that untrained and undisciplined local police forces and National Guardsmen might trigger a &quot;guerrilla war in the streets&quot;, as evidenced by the climate of sniper fire in Newark and Detroit.

Johnson&#x27;s popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities and his own party. The president created the Kerner Commission to study the causes behind the recurring outbreaks of urban civil disorder, headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. The commission&#x27;s 1968 report suggested legislative measures to promote racial integration and alleviate poverty and concluded that the nation was &quot;moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.&quot; According to Press Secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: &quot;What did you expect? ... When you put your foot on a man&#x27;s neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what&#x27;s he going to do? He&#x27;s going to knock your block off.&quot;

===Backlash against Johnson (1966–1967)===
In 1966, the press sensed a credibility gap between what Johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening in the Vietnam War, which led to less favorable coverage of Johnson and his administration.

By the end of 1966, Democratic Governor Warren E. Hearnes of Missouri warned that Johnson would lose the state by 100,000 votes, despite winning by a margin of 500,000 in 1964. &quot;Frustration over Vietnam; too much federal spending and ... taxation; no great public support for your Great Society programs; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs &quot;had eroded the President&#x27;s standing, the governor reported. There were bright spots; in January 1967, Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history, unemployment was at a 13-year low, and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever; a 4.5 percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome, as was the rise in interest rates. Johnson asked for a temporary 6 percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending. Johnson&#x27;s approval ratings stayed below 50 percent and, in December 1966, his disapproval rating surpassed his approval rating. In January 1967, the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16 percent, from 25 percent four months before.

Asked to explain his diminished popularity, Johnson said, &quot;I am a dominating personality, and when I get things done I don&#x27;t always please all the people.&quot; Johnson also blamed the press, saying they showed &quot;complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to&quot;, and &quot;the preachers, liberals and professors&quot; who had turned against him.

In the congressional elections of 1966, the Republicans gained three seats in the Senate and 47 in the House, reinvigorating the conservative coalition, which made it more difficult for Johnson to pass additional Great Society legislation. However, Congress ultimately passed almost 96 percent of the administration&#x27;s Great Society programs.

===Space program===

During the Johnson administration, NASA conducted the Gemini crewed space program, developed the Saturn V rocket and its launch facility, and prepared to make the first crewed Apollo program flights. On January 27, 1967, the nation was stunned when the entire crew of Apollo 1 was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad, stopping Apollo in its tracks. Rather than appointing another Warren-style commission, Johnson accepted Administrator James E. Webb&#x27;s request for NASA to do its own investigation.

Johnson maintained his staunch support of Apollo through Congressional and press controversy, and the program recovered. The first two crewed missions, Apollo 7 and the first crewed flight to the Moon, Apollo 8, were completed by the end of Johnson&#x27;s term. He congratulated the Apollo 8 crew, saying, &quot;You&#x27;ve taken ... all of us, all over the world, into a new era.&quot; On July 16, 1969, Johnson attended the launch of the first Moon landing mission Apollo 11, becoming the first former or incumbent U.S. president to witness a rocket launch.

===Vietnam War===


The Vietnam War began in 1955 as Communist forces started operating in South Vietnam. By the time Johnson took office, there were 16,700 American military personnel in South Vietnam. Despite some misgivings, Johnson ultimately came to support escalation of the U.S. role in Vietnam. Like the vast majority of American leaders in the mid-1960s, he was determined to prevent the spread of Communism. Johnson&#x27;s decision to escalate was also influenced heavily by reputation. Under pressure from pro-war politicians like Barry Goldwater, Johnson feared that if he made the decision to not stand firm in Vietnam he would lose domestic political credibility as well as contribute to a decline in the international reputation of the U.S.
On October 11, 1963, President Kennedy had signed NSAM 263 ordering the withdrawal of 1,000 military personnel by the end of the year following recommendations of the McNamara–Taylor mission report. On November 26, Johnson signed NSAM 273 which reaffirmed the Kennedy administration withdrawal approval and continued support for South Vietnam. In August 1964, ambiguous evidence suggested two U.S. destroyers had been attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin. Although Johnson very much wanted to keep discussions about Vietnam out of the 1964 election campaign, he felt forced to respond to the supposed Communist aggression. He obtained from Congress the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 7, 1964, giving blanket congressional approval for use of military force to repel future attacks.
Johnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign, which became known as Operation Rolling Thunder, in February 1965 after an attack by Viet Cong guerrillas on Pleiku Air Base, killing eight Americans. The U.S. would continue to bomb North Vietnam until late 1968. In March 1965, McGeorge Bundy called for American ground operations; Johnson agreed and also quietly changed the mission from defensive to offensive operations. On March 8, 1965, 3,500 troops went ashore near Da Nang, the first time U.S. combat forces had been sent to mainland Asia since the Korean War. In June, South Vietnamese Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse. In late July, McNamara and Johnson&#x27;s top advisors recommended an increase in U.S. soldiers from 75,000 to over 200,000. Johnson agreed but felt boxed in by unpalatable choices. If he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist, and if he did not, he thought he risked being impeached. By October 1965, there were over 200,000 troops deployed in Vietnam. Throughout 1965, few members of Congress or the administration openly criticized Johnson&#x27;s handling of the war.

In early 1966, Senator Robert F. Kennedy harshly criticized Johnson&#x27;s bombing campaign, stating that the U.S. may be headed &quot;on a road from which there is no turning back, a road that leads to catastrophe for all mankind.&quot; Soon thereafter, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Senator James William Fulbright, held televised hearings examining the administration&#x27;s Vietnam policy. In July, polling results indicated that Americans favored the bombing campaign by a five-to-one margin; however, in August a Defense Department study indicated that the bombing campaign was having minimal impact on North Vietnam. By late 1966, multiple sources began to report progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure; Johnson was urged to begin peace discussions. English philosopher Bertrand Russell initiated the International War Crimes Tribunal to condemn the American effort. The gap with Hanoi, however, was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces. Johnson grew more and more anxious about justifying war casualties, and talked of the need for decisive victory, despite the unpopularity of the cause. By the end of 1966, it was clear that the air campaign and the pacification effort had both failed, and Johnson agreed to McNamara&#x27;s new recommendation to add 70,000 troops in 1967 and the CIA&#x27;s recommendations to increased bombings against North Vietnam. The bombing escalation ended secret talks being held with North Vietnam, but U.S. leaders did not consider North Vietnamese intentions in those talks to be genuine.
By the middle of 1967 nearly 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded in the war, which was being commonly described in the news media and elsewhere as a &quot;stalemate.&quot; In January and February, probes were made to assess North Vietnamese&#x27;s willingness to discuss peace, but they fell on deaf ears. Ho Chi Minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral U.S. withdrawal. A Gallup, Inc. poll in July 1967 showed that 52 percent of Americans disapproved of the president&#x27;s handling of the war, and only 34 percent thought progress was being made. Nonetheless, Johnson agreed to an increase of 55,000 troops, bringing the total to 525,000. In August, Johnson, with the Joint Chiefs&#x27; support, decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only Hanoi, Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list. Later that month McNamara told a Senate subcommittee that an expanded air campaign would not bring Hanoi to the peace table. The Joint Chiefs were astounded, and threatened mass resignation; McNamara was summoned to the White House for a three-hour dressing down. Nevertheless, Johnson had received reports from the CIA confirming McNamara&#x27;s analysis at least in part. In the meantime an election establishing a constitutional government in the South was concluded and provided hope for peace talks.

With the war arguably in a stalemate and in light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict, Johnson convened a group of veteran government foreign policy experts, informally known as &quot;the Wise Men&quot;: Dean Acheson, General Omar Bradley, George Ball, McGeorge Bundy, Arthur Dean, C. Douglas Dillon, Abe Fortas, Averell Harriman, Henry Cabot Lodge, Robert Daniel Murphy, and Maxwell D. Taylor. They unanimously opposed leaving Vietnam, and encouraged Johnson to &quot;stay the course.&quot; Afterward, on November 17, in a nationally televised address, the president assured the American public, &quot;We are inflicting greater losses than we&#x27;re taking...We are making progress.&quot; Less than two weeks later, Robert McNamara announced his resignation as Defense Secretary. Behind closed doors, he had begun regularly expressing doubts over Johnson&#x27;s war strategy, angering the president. He joined a growing list of Johnson&#x27;s top aides who resigned over the war, including Bill Moyers, McGeorge Bundy, and George Ball. In October, with ever-increasing public protests against the war, Johnson engaged the FBI and the CIA to investigate, monitor, and undermine anti-war activists. In mid-October, there was a demonstration of 100,000 at the Pentagon; Johnson and Dean Rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration, but that was refuted in the CIA&#x27;s findings.

====Tet Offensive====
On January 30, 1968, the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army began the Tet Offensive against South Vietnam&#x27;s five largest cities, including Saigon. While the Tet Offensive failed militarily, it was a psychological victory, definitively turning American public opinion against the war effort. In February 1968, influential news anchor Walter Cronkite of CBS News expressed on the air that the conflict was deadlocked and that additional fighting would change nothing. Johnson reacted, saying &quot;If I&#x27;ve lost Cronkite, I&#x27;ve lost middle America&quot;. Indeed, demoralization about the war was everywhere; 26 percent then approved of Johnson&#x27;s handling of Vietnam, while 63 percent disapproved. College students and others protested, burned draft cards, and chanted, &quot;Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?&quot;

The Tet Offensive convinced senior leaders of the Johnson administration, including the &quot;Wise Men&quot; and new Defense Secretary Clark Clifford, that further escalation of troop levels would not help bring an end to the war. Johnson was initially reluctant to follow this advice, but ultimately agreed to allow a partial bombing halt and to signal his willingness to engage in peace talks. On March 31, 1968, Johnson announced that he would halt the bombing in North Vietnam, while at the same time announcing that he would not seek re-election. He also escalated U.S. military operations in South Vietnam in order to consolidate control of as much of the countryside as possible before the onset of serious peace talks. Talks began in Paris in May, but failed to yield any results. Two of the major obstacles in negotiations were the unwillingness of the United States to allow the Viet Cong to take part in the South Vietnamese government, and the unwillingness of North Vietnam to recognize the legitimacy of South Vietnam. In October 1968, when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt, Republican presidential nominee Richard Nixon intervened with the South Vietnamese, promising better terms so as to delay a settlement on the issue until after the election. Johnson sought a continuation of talks after the 1968 election, but the North Vietnamese argued about procedural matters until after Nixon took office.

===Dominican Republic===
Like President Kennedy, Johnson sought to isolate Cuba, which was under the rule of the Soviet-aligned Fidel Castro.

In 1965, the Dominican Civil War broke out between the government of President Donald Reid Cabral and supporters of former president Juan Bosch. On the advice of Abe Fortas, Johnson dispatched over 20,000 Marines to the Dominican Republic. Their role was not take sides but to evacuate American citizens and restore order. The U.S. also helped arrange an agreement providing for new elections. Johnson&#x27;s use of force in ending the civil war alienated many in Latin America, and the region&#x27;s importance to the administration receded as Johnson&#x27;s foreign policy became increasingly dominated by the Vietnam War.

===Soviet Union===


Though actively engaged in containment in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, Johnson made it a priority to seek arms control deals with Moscow. The Soviet Union also sought closer relations to the United States during the mid-to-late 1960s, partly due to the increasingly worse Sino-Soviet split. Johnson attempted to reduce tensions with China by easing restrictions on trade, but the beginning of China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution ended hopes of a greater rapprochement. Johnson was concerned with averting the possibility of nuclear war, and he sought to reduce tensions in Europe. The Johnson administration pursued arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, signing the Outer Space Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and laid the foundation for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. Johnson held a largely amicable meeting with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin at the Glassboro Summit Conference in 1967, and in July 1968 the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in which each signatory agreed not to help other countries develop or acquire nuclear weapons. A planned nuclear disarmament summit between the United States and the Soviet Union was scuttled after Soviet forces violently suppressed the Prague Spring, an attempted democratization of Czechoslovakia.

===Surveillance of Martin Luther King===
Johnson continued the FBI&#x27;s wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. authorized by the Kennedy administration under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Johnson also authorized the tapping of phone conversations of others, including the Vietnamese friends of a Nixon associate.

===International trips===

Johnson made eleven international trips to twenty countries during his presidency. He flew aboard Air Force One while in office. His October 1966 visit to Australia sparked demonstrations from anti-war protesters. One of the most unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before Christmas 1967. The President began the trip by going to the memorial for Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt, who was presumed drowned in a swimming accident. The White House did not reveal in advance to the press that the President would make the first round-the-world presidential trip. The trip was completed in only 112.5 hours (4.7 days). Air Force One crossed the equator twice, stopped at Travis Air Force Base, in Honolulu, Pago Pago, Canberra, Melbourne, Vietnam, Karachi, and Rome.

===1968 presidential election===


As he had served less than two years of President Kennedy&#x27;s term, Johnson was constitutionally eligible for election to a second full term in the 1968 presidential election. Despite Johnson&#x27;s growing unpopularity, conventional wisdom held that it would be impossible to deny re-nomination to a sitting president. In September 1967 Johnson openly admitted he was considering dropping out of the race for re-election. Johnson won a narrow victory in the New Hampshire presidential primary on March 12, but in a March 31 speech, Johnson shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for re-election by concluding with the line: &quot;I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president&quot;. The next day, his approval ratings increased from 36 percent to 49 percent.

Historians have debated the factors that led to Johnson&#x27;s surprise decision. Shesol says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication; when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave. Woods writes that Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal. Dallek says that Johnson had no further domestic goals, and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity. His health was not good, and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink. Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker. Bennett, however, says Johnson &quot;had been forced out of a reelection race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in Southeast Asia.&quot; Johnson may also have hoped that the convention would ultimately choose to draft him back into the race.

Vice President Hubert Humphrey entered the race after Johnson&#x27;s withdrawal, making the 1968 Democratic primaries a three-way contest between Humphrey, Kennedy, and McCarthy. Kennedy cut into McCarthy&#x27;s liberal and anti-war base, while also winning the support of the poor and working class. He won a series of primary victories, but was assassinated in June by Sirhan Sirhan, an Arab nationalist. With Johnson&#x27;s support, Humphrey won the presidential nomination at the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago in late August. Violent police attacks against anti-war protesters in Chicago marred the convention.

Humphrey&#x27;s polling numbers improved after a September 30 speech in which he broke with Johnson&#x27;s war policy, calling for an end to the bombing of North Vietnam. In what was termed the October surprise, Johnson announced to the nation on October 31, 1968, that he had ordered a complete cessation of &quot;all air, naval and artillery bombardment of North Vietnam&quot;, effective November 1, should the North Vietnamese government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the Paris peace talks.

Republican nominee Richard Nixon won the election.

===Judicial appointments===

Johnson appointed Justices Abe Fortas (1965) and Thurgood Marshall (1967) to the Supreme Court of the United States. Johnson anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures in 1965 and thought it advantageous to have a &quot;mole&quot; in the Supreme Court to provide him with inside information, as he was able to get from the legislative branch. Abe Fortas in particular Johnson thought could fill the bill. The opportunity arose when an opening occurred for ambassador to the UN, with Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s death; Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg accepted Johnson&#x27;s offer to transfer to the UN position. Johnson insisted on Fortas assuming Goldberg&#x27;s seat, over Fortas&#x27;s wife&#x27;s objection that it was too early in his career. When Earl Warren announced his retirement in 1968, Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed him as Chief Justice of the United States, and nominated Homer Thornberry to succeed Fortas as associate justice. However, Fortas&#x27;s nomination was filibustered by senators, and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate.

==Post-presidency (1969–1973)==
After leaving the presidency in January 1969, Johnson went home to his ranch in Stonewall, Texas, accompanied by former aide and speechwriter Harry J. Middleton, who would draft Johnson&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Choices We Face,&quot; and work with him on his memoirs, &quot;The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency 1963–1969,&quot; published in 1971. That year, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum opened on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin. He donated his Texas ranch in his will to the public to form the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, with the provision that it &quot;remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past&quot;.
Johnson gave Nixon high grades in foreign policy, but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing U.S. forces from South Vietnam before the South Vietnamese were able to defend themselves. &quot;If the South falls to the Communists, we can have a serious backlash here at home,&quot; he warned.

During the 1972 presidential election, Johnson only reluctantly endorsed Democratic nominee George McGovern, a senator from South Dakota; McGovern had long opposed Johnson&#x27;s foreign and defense policies. Johnson wanted to attend the Democratic National Convention, but was advised not to attend as he would not be welcome. The McGovern nomination and platform dismayed him. Nixon could be defeated, Johnson insisted, &quot;if only the Democrats don&#x27;t go too far left&quot;. Johnson felt Edmund Muskie would be more likely to defeat Nixon; however, he declined to try to stop McGovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the Democratic Party was such that anything he said was more likely to help McGovern. Johnson&#x27;s protégé John Connally had served as President Nixon&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury and then stepped down to head &quot;Democrats for Nixon&quot;, a group funded by Republicans. It was the first time that Connally and Johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and children===
On November 17, 1934, Johnson married Claudia Alta &quot;Lady Bird&quot; Taylor from Karnack, Texas. The two first met after he attended Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C. for one semester. During their first date, Johnson asked her to marry him; many dates later, she finally agreed. The wedding was officiated by Arthur R. McKinstry at St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church in San Antonio. They had two daughters: Lynda Bird in 1944 and Luci Baines in 1947. Johnson gave his children names with the LBJ initials; his dog was named Little Beagle Johnson, and his home was the LBJ Ranch in the Texas Hill Country. His initials were on his cufflinks, ashtrays, and clothes. During his marriage, Johnson had affairs with &quot;numerous&quot; women, including socialite Alice Marsh, who was considered, outside his marriage, his most important relationship.

===Health===

On July 2, 1955, at age 46, Johnson, a 60-cigarette-per-day smoker, suffered a near-fatal heart attack, which inspired him to discontinue smoking. Five months later, Johnson&#x27;s doctors reported he had made &quot;a most satisfactory recovery&quot;.

Johnson likely suffered a second heart attack following President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, but the diagnosis released to the public was that he had an angina attack.

On November 8, 1965, Johnson underwent surgery at Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove his gallbladder and a kidney stone. After the procedure, Johnson&#x27;s doctors reported that the president had come through the surgery &quot;beautifully as expected.&quot; He was able to resume his duties the following day, and he met with reporters a couple of days later to reassure the nation that he was recovering well. Although Johnson was incapacitated during surgery, there was no transfer of presidential power to Vice President Humphrey.

In March 1970, Johnson suffered an attack of angina and was taken to Brooke Army General Hospital in San Antonio. He had gained more than since leaving the White House; he now weighed around and was urged to lose considerable weight. By the summer of 1970, again gripped by chronic chest pains, Johnson lost in less than a month on a crash water diet. He had also resumed smoking shortly before Christmas 1971, having not smoked since his near-fatal heart attack in July 1955.

In April 1972, Johnson had another major heart attack while visiting his daughter, Lynda, in Virginia. &quot;I&#x27;m hurting real bad&quot;, he confided to friends. The chest pains returned nearly every afternoon jolting pains that left him frightened and breathless. A portable oxygen tank was kept by his bed, and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask. He continued to smoke heavily and, although nominally on a low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, kept to it only intermittently. Meanwhile, he began to experience severe abdominal pains, diagnosed as diverticulosis. His heart condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended. Johnson flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Michael DeBakey, where he learned his condition was terminal. DeBakey found that despite two of Johnson&#x27;s coronary arteries being in urgent need of a coronary bypass, his heart was in such poor condition that he likely would have died during surgery.

==Death==
Johnson recorded an hour-long television interview with newsman Walter Cronkite at his ranch on January 12, 1973, in which he discussed his legacy, particularly about the civil rights movement. He was still smoking heavily, and told Cronkite that it was better for his heart &quot;to smoke than to be nervous&quot;.

At approximately 3:40 P.M. Central on January 22, 1973, Johnson suffered his final heart attack in his bedroom. He managed to telephone the Secret Service agents on the ranch, who found him still holding the telephone receiver, unconscious and &quot;appear[ing] to be dead&quot;. They attempted resuscitation, and Johnson was airlifted in one of his planes to San Antonio International Airport, en route to Brooke Army Medical Center. However, cardiologist and Army colonel George McGranahan pronounced him dead on arrival at the airport at 4:33 P.M. Johnson was 64.

Shortly after the former president was pronounced dead, Johnson&#x27;s press secretary Tom Johnson (no relation) telephoned Cronkite to tell him. Cronkite was anchoring &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; live at the moment Johnson reached him, which enabled him to report on President Johnson&#x27;s death as he received direct information. Nixon mentioned Johnson&#x27;s death in a speech he gave the day after Johnson died, announcing the peace agreement to end the Vietnam War.

===Funeral===
Johnson was honored with a state funeral. Initially, his body lay in repose at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin. Afterwards, Johnson&#x27;s body was flown to Washington. Texas Congressman J. J. Pickle and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk eulogized him when he lay in state at the Capitol.

The state funeral took place on January 25 at the National City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., where he had often worshiped as president. The service was presided over by President Nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries, led by Eisaku Satō, who had served as Japanese prime minister during Johnson&#x27;s presidency. Eulogies were given by George Davis, the church&#x27;s pastor, and W. Marvin Watson, Johnson&#x27;s last Postmaster General and a longtime advisor.

Later that same day, Johnson was buried in his family&#x27;s private cemetery in Gillespie County, Texas, near the house in which he was born. Billy Graham officiated the service. He and former Texas governor Connally gave eulogies. Several hundred people were in attendance.

The state funeral, the last for a president until Richard Nixon&#x27;s in 1994, occurred the same week as Nixon&#x27;s second inauguration. As Johnson died only two days after the inauguration, various activities surrounding the inauguration were canceled.

==Personality and public image==
According to biographer Randall Woods, Johnson posed in many different roles:

Johnson had his particular brand of persuasion, known as &quot;The Johnson Treatment&quot;. &quot;There was no more powerful majority leader in American history,&quot; biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, &quot;He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them.&quot; As president, Johnson vetoed 30 bills; no other president in history vetoed so many bills and never had a single one overridden by Congress. He was often seen as an ambitious, tireless, and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He typically worked 18- to 20-hour days without a break and had no regular leisure activities. He stood tall.

Johnson&#x27;s cowboy hat and boots reflected his Texas roots and love of the rural hill country. From of land that he was given by an aunt in 1951, he created a working ranch with 400 cattle. The National Park Service keeps a herd descended from Johnson&#x27;s and maintains the ranch property.

Biographer Randall Woods argues that Social Gospel themes Johnson learned from childhood allowed him to transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, and explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach to Christian internationalism and nation-building. For example, in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church, adding &quot;It would be very hard for me to write a more perfect description of the American ideal.&quot;

==Legacy==
Scholars have viewed Johnson through the lens of both his legislative achievements and his lack of success in the Vietnam War. His overall rating among historians has remained relatively steady, and his average ranking is higher than any of the eight presidents who followed him, although similar to Reagan and Clinton. In public polling of presidential favorability of Johnson and the presidents who succeeded him Johnson tends to appear more toward the bottom of lists, typically excepting Donald Trump, George W. Bush and Richard Nixon, and sometimes Gerald Ford.

Historian Kent Germany explains:The man who was elected to the White House by one of the widest margins in U.S. history and pushed through as much legislation as any other American politician now seems to be remembered best by the public for succeeding an assassinated hero, steering the country into a quagmire in Vietnam, cheating on his saintly wife, exposing his stitched-up belly, using profanity, picking up dogs by their ears, swimming naked with advisers in the White House pool, and emptying his bowels while conducting official business. Of all those issues, Johnson&#x27;s reputation suffers the most from his management of the Vietnam War, something that has overshadowed his civil rights and domestic policy accomplishments and caused Johnson himself to regret his handling of &quot;the woman I really loved the Great Society.&quot;

===Memorials===

The Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston was renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1973, and the United States Department of Education headquarters was named after Johnson in 2007. The Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin was named in his honor, as is the Lyndon B. Johnson National Grassland. Also named for him are schools in Austin and Laredo, Texas; Melbourne, Florida; and Jackson, Kentucky. Interstate 635 in Dallas is named the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway. The Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove on the Potomac was dedicated in 1976.

Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 1980. Texas created a state holiday on August 27 to mark Johnson&#x27;s birthday, known as Lyndon Baines Johnson Day.

<doc id="54536" wikidata="Q159683" url="?curid=54536" title="Citric acid">
<text>Citric acid is an organic compound with the formula . It is a colorless weak organic acid. It occurs naturally in citrus fruits. In biochemistry, it is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, which occurs in the metabolism of all aerobic organisms.

More than two million tons of citric acid are manufactured every year. It is used widely as acidifier, flavoring, preservative, and chelating agent.

A citrate is a derivative of citric acid; that is, the salts, esters, and the polyatomic anion found in solutions and salts of citric acid. An example of the former, a salt is trisodium citrate; an ester is triethyl citrate. When citrate trianion is part of a salt, the formula of the citrate trianion is written as or .

==Natural occurrence and industrial production==

Citric acid occurs in a variety of fruits and vegetables, most notably citrus fruits. Lemons and limes have particularly high concentrations of the acid; it can constitute as much as 8% of the dry weight of these fruits (about 47 g/L in the juices). The concentrations of citric acid in citrus fruits range from 0.005 mol/L for oranges and grapefruits to 0.30 mol/L in lemons and limes; these values vary within species depending upon the cultivar and the circumstances under which the fruit was grown.

Citric acid was first isolated in 1784 by the chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who crystallized it from lemon juice.

Industrial-scale citric acid production first began in 1890 based on the Italian citrus fruit industry, where the juice was treated with hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) to precipitate calcium citrate, which was isolated and converted back to the acid using diluted sulfuric acid. In 1893, C. Wehmer discovered &quot;Penicillium&quot; mold could produce citric acid from sugar. However, microbial production of citric acid did not become industrially important until World War I disrupted Italian &quot;Citrus&quot; exports.

In 1917, American food chemist James Currie discovered that certain strains of the mold &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; could be efficient citric acid producers, and the pharmaceutical company Pfizer began industrial-level production using this technique two years later, followed by Citrique Belge in 1929. In this production technique, which is still the major industrial route to citric acid used today, cultures of &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; are fed on a sucrose or glucose-containing medium to produce citric acid. The source of sugar is corn steep liquor, molasses, hydrolyzed corn starch, or other inexpensive, carbohydrate solution. After the mold is filtered out of the resulting suspension, citric acid is isolated by precipitating it with calcium hydroxide to yield calcium citrate salt, from which citric acid is regenerated by treatment with sulfuric acid, as in the direct extraction from citrus fruit juice.

In 1977, a patent was granted to Lever Brothers for the chemical synthesis of citric acid starting either from aconitic or isocitrate (also called alloisocitrate) calcium salts under high pressure conditions; this produced citric acid in near quantitative conversion under what appeared to be a reverse, non-enzymatic Krebs cycle reaction.

Global production was in excess of 2,000,000 tons in 2018. More than 50% of this volume was produced in China. More than 50% was used as an acidity regulator in beverages, some 20% in other food applications, 20% for detergent applications, and 10% for applications other than food, such as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and in the chemical industry.

==Chemical characteristics==
Citric acid can be obtained as an anhydrous (water-free) form or as a monohydrate. The anhydrous form crystallizes from hot water, while the monohydrate forms when citric acid is crystallized from cold water. The monohydrate can be converted to the anhydrous form at about 78 °C. Citric acid also dissolves in absolute (anhydrous) ethanol (76 parts of citric acid per 100 parts of ethanol) at 15 °C. It decomposes with loss of carbon dioxide above about 175 °C.

Citric acid is a triprotic acid, with pKa values, extrapolated to zero ionic strength, of 3.128, 4.761, and 6.396 at 25 °C. The pKa of the hydroxyl group has been found, by means of 13C NMR spectroscopy, to be 14.4. 
The speciation diagram shows that solutions of citric acid are buffer solutions between about pH 2 and pH 8. In biological systems around pH 7, the two species present are the citrate ion and mono-hydrogen citrate ion. The SSC 20X hybridization buffer is an example in common use. Tables compiled for biochemical studies are available.

Conversely, the pH of a 1 mM solution of citric acid will be about 3.2. The pH of fruit juices from citrus fruits like oranges and lemons depends on the citric acid concentration, with a higher concentration of citric acid resulting in a lower pH.

Acid salts of citric acid can be prepared by careful adjustment of the pH before crystallizing the compound. See, for example, sodium citrate.

The citrate ion forms complexes with metallic cations. The stability constants for the formation of these complexes are quite large because of the chelate effect. Consequently, it forms complexes even with alkali metal cations. However, when a chelate complex is formed using all three carboxylate groups, the chelate rings have 7 and 8 members, which are generally less stable thermodynamically than smaller chelate rings. In consequence, the hydroxyl group can be deprotonated, forming part of a more stable 5-membered ring, as in ammonium ferric citrate, .

Citric acid can be esterified at one or more of its three carboxylic acid groups to form any of a variety of mono-, di-, tri-, and mixed esters.

==Biochemistry==
===Citric acid cycle===
Citrate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, also known as the &quot;tricarboxylic acid&quot; (&quot;TCA&quot;) &quot;cycle&quot; or the &quot;Krebs cycle&quot;, a central metabolic pathway for animals, plants, and bacteria. In the Krebs cycle, citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate with acetyl CoA to form citrate. Citrate then acts as the substrate for aconitase and is converted into aconitic acid. The cycle ends with regeneration of oxaloacetate. This series of chemical reactions is the source of two-thirds of the food-derived energy in higher organisms. The chemical energy released is available under the form of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Hans Adolf Krebs received the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery.

===Other biological roles===
Citrate can be transported out of the mitochondria and into the cytoplasm, then broken down into acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis, and into oxaloacetate. Citrate is a positive modulator of this conversion, and allosterically regulates the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is the regulating enzyme in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA (the commitment step in fatty acid synthesis). In short, citrate is transported into the cytoplasm, converted into acetyl-CoA, which is then converted into malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is allosterically modulated by citrate.

High concentrations of cytosolic citrate can inhibit phosphofructokinase, the catalyst of a rate-limiting step of glycolysis. This effect is advantageous: high concentrations of citrate indicate that there is a large supply of biosynthetic precursor molecules, so there is no need for phosphofructokinase to continue to send molecules of its substrate, fructose 6-phosphate, into glycolysis. Citrate acts by augmenting the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of ATP, another sign that there is no need to carry out glycolysis.

Citrate is a vital component of bone, helping to regulate the size of apatite crystals.

==Applications==
===Food and drink===

Because it is one of the stronger edible acids, the dominant use of citric acid is as a flavoring and preservative in food and beverages, especially soft drinks and candies. Within the European Union it is denoted by E number E330. Citrate salts of various metals are used to deliver those minerals in a biologically available form in many dietary supplements. Citric acid has 247 kcal per 100 g. In the United States the purity requirements for citric acid as a food additive are defined by the Food Chemicals Codex, which is published by the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP).

Citric acid can be added to ice cream as an emulsifying agent to keep fats from separating, to caramel to prevent sucrose crystallization, or in recipes in place of fresh lemon juice. Citric acid is used with sodium bicarbonate in a wide range of effervescent formulae, both for ingestion (e.g., powders and tablets) and for personal care (&quot;e.g.&quot;, bath salts, bath bombs, and cleaning of grease). Citric acid sold in a dry powdered form is commonly sold in markets and groceries as &quot;sour salt&quot;, due to its physical resemblance to table salt. It has use in culinary applications, as an alternative to vinegar or lemon juice, where a pure acid is needed. Citric acid can be used in food coloring to balance the pH level of a normally basic dye.

===Cleaning and chelating agent===

Citric acid is an excellent chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and evaporators. It can be used to treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. By chelating the metals in hard water, it lets these cleaners produce foam and work better without need for water softening. Citric acid is the active ingredient in some bathroom and kitchen cleaning solutions. A solution with a six percent concentration of citric acid will remove hard water stains from glass without scrubbing. Citric acid can be used in shampoo to wash out wax and coloring from the hair. Illustrative of its chelating abilities, citric acid was the first successful eluant used for total ion-exchange separation of the lanthanides, during the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. In the 1950s, it was replaced by the far more efficient EDTA.

In industry, it is used to dissolve rust from steel, and to passivate stainless steels.

===Cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and foods===
Citric acid is used as an acidulant in creams, gels, and liquids. Used in foods and dietary supplements, it may be classified as a processing aid if it was added for a technical or functional effect (e.g. acidulent, chelator, viscosifier, etc.). If it is still present in insignificant amounts, and the technical or functional effect is no longer present, it may be exempt from labeling &lt;21 CFR §101.100(c)&gt;.

Citric acid is an alpha hydroxy acid and is an active ingredient in chemical skin peels.

Citric acid is commonly used as a buffer to increase the solubility of brown heroin.

Citric acid is used as one of the active ingredients in the production of facial tissues with antiviral properties.
=== Other uses ===
The buffering properties of citrates are used to control pH in household cleaners and pharmaceuticals.

Citric acid is used as an odorless alternative to white vinegar for fabric dyeing with acid dyes.

Sodium citrate is a component of Benedict&#x27;s reagent, used for both qualitative and quantitative identification of reducing sugars.

Citric acid can be used as an alternative to nitric acid in passivation of stainless steel.

Citric acid can be used as a lower-odor stop bath as part of the process for developing photographic film. Photographic developers are alkaline, so a mild acid is used to neutralize and stop their action quickly, but commonly used acetic acid leaves a strong vinegar odor in the darkroom.

Citric acid is an excellent soldering flux, either dry or as a concentrated solution in water. It should be removed after soldering, especially with fine wires, as it is mildly corrosive. It dissolves and rinses quickly in hot water.

Alkali citrate can be used as an inhibitor of kidney stones by increasing urine citrate levels, useful for prevention of calcium stones, and increasing urine pH, useful for preventing uric acid and cystine stones.

==Synthesis of other organic compounds==
Citric acid is a versatile precursor to many other organic compounds. Dehydration routes give itaconic acid and its anhydride. Citraconic acid can be produced via thermal isomerization of itaconic acid anhydride. The required itaconic acid anhydride is obtained by dry distillation of citric acid. Aconitic acid can be synthesized by dehydration of citric acid using sulfuric acid:
:(HO2CCH2)2C(OH)CO2H → HO2CCH=C(CO2H)CH2CO2H + H2O

Acetonedicarboxylic acid can also be prepared by decarboxylation of citric acid in fuming sulfuric acid.

==Safety==
Although a weak acid, exposure to pure citric acid can cause adverse effects. Inhalation may cause cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Over-ingestion may cause abdominal pain and sore throat. Exposure of concentrated solutions to skin and eyes can cause redness and pain. Long-term or repeated consumption may cause erosion of tooth enamel.

<doc id="54539" wikidata="Q43874" url="?curid=54539" title="Eddie Murphy">
<text>Edward Regan Murphy (born April 3, 1961) is an American actor, comedian, and singer. He had his breakthrough as a standup comic before gaining stardom for his film roles; he is widely recognized as one of the greatest comedians of all time. He has received several accolades including a Golden Globe Award, a Grammy Award, and an Emmy Award as well as nominations for an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award. He was honored with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2015 and the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2023.

Murphy shot to fame on the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, for which he was a regular cast member from 1980 to 1984 and broke out as a movie star in the 1980s films &quot;48 Hrs.&quot;, &quot;Trading Places,&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;. He then established himself as a leading man with starring roles in: &quot;The Golden Child&quot; (1986), &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988), &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; (which he also directed) (1989), &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1992), &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1996), &quot;&quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot;&quot; (1997), &quot;Bowfinger&quot; (1999), &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; (2003), and &quot;Norbit&quot; (2007). Murphy both won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (2006).

Murphy has worked as a voice actor, including Mushu in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998), Thurgood Stubbs in the sitcom &quot;The PJs&quot; (1999–2001), and Donkey in the &quot;Shrek&quot; franchise (2001–present), the latter of which earned him a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. Murphy often takes on multiple roles in a single film, such as in &quot;Coming to America&quot;, the &quot;Nutty Professor&quot; films, &quot;Bowfinger&quot; and &quot;Norbit.&quot; This is intended as Murphy&#x27;s tribute to one of his idols, Peter Sellers. Following a string of poorly received films, he had a career resurgence with leading roles in films such as &quot;Dolemite Is My Name&quot; (2019), &quot;Coming 2 America&quot; (2021), &quot;You People&quot;, &quot;Candy Cane Lane&quot; (both 2023) and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot; (2024).

In 2020, he won his first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Murphy&#x27;s films have grossed over $3.8 billion ( adjusted for inflation) in the United States and Canada box office, and over $6.7 billion worldwide. In 2015, his films made him the sixth-highest grossing actor in the United States. As a singer, Murphy has released three studio albums, including &quot;How Could It Be&quot; (1985), &quot;So Happy&quot; (1989), and &quot;Love&#x27;s Alright&quot; (1993). He is also known for his 1985 single &quot;Party All the Time&quot;, which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Early life==
Murphy was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and raised in the borough&#x27;s Bushwick neighborhood. His mother, Lillian Murphy (née Laney, later Murphy Lynch), was a telephone operator, and his father, Charles Edward Murphy (1940–1969), was a transit police officer and an amateur actor and comedian.

His father was murdered in 1969. Murphy later stated:
When Murphy&#x27;s single mother became ill, eight-year-old Murphy and his elder brother Charlie (1959–2017) lived in foster care for one year. In interviews, Murphy has said his time in foster care was influential in developing his sense of humor. Later, he and his brother were raised in Roosevelt, New York, by his mother and stepfather Vernon Lynch, a foreman at an ice cream plant.

==Career==
===1976–1980: Early standup career===
When Murphy was fifteen, he listened to Richard Pryor&#x27;s comedy album &quot;That Nigger&#x27;s Crazy&quot;, which inspired his decision to become a comedian. As a child, Murphy developed playing multiple characters in imitation of his acting hero, Peter Sellers. Other early influences included Bill Cosby, Redd Foxx, Robin Williams, Muhammad Ali, Bruce Lee, and Charlie Chaplin.

On July 9, 1976, the date with which Murphy marks the beginning of his career, he performed in a talent show at the Roosevelt Youth Center, doing an impersonation of singer Al Green as Green&#x27;s song &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; played. This led to work at other clubs within walking distance, and then late-night jobs at locations that required him to commute by train. To do this, he secretly skipped school, and after his mother discovered this at the end of his senior year, he was required to attend summer school.

===1980s: Superstar status and career peak===

In the early 1980s, Murphy first earned national attention as a cast member on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) and was credited with helping to revitalize the show. His characters included a grown-up version of the &quot;Little Rascals&quot; character Buckwheat; a streetwise children&#x27;s show host named Mr. Robinson (parodying Fred Rogers, who found it amusing); and a morose, cynical Gumby, whose trademark slogan became an &quot;SNL&quot; catchphrase: &quot;I&#x27;m Gumby, dammit!&quot; According to Joseph Clokey, whose father Art Clokey created Gumby, both of them &quot;thought Eddie was a genius in the way he played that character&quot;. The Buckwheat character was retired in spectacular fashion—assassinated, on camera, in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza—at Murphy&#x27;s request, after he grew tired of constant demands from fans to &quot;Do Buckwheat! Do Buckwheat!&quot; In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 &quot;SNL&quot; cast members to date, Murphy was ranked second (behind John Belushi). &quot;It is customary (and accurate) to say that Eddie Murphy is the only reason &quot;SNL&quot; survived the five-year wilderness without Lorne Michaels&quot;, the magazine noted. Murphy&#x27;s early comedy was characterized by copious profanity and sketches lampooning a diverse group of people (including WASPs, African Americans, Italian Americans, overweight people, and gay people). He released two stand-up specials. &quot;Delirious&quot; was filmed in 1983 in Washington, D.C.
Due to the popularity of &quot;Delirious&quot;, his concert film, &quot;Eddie Murphy Raw&quot; (1987), received a wide theatrical release, grossing $50 million; the movie was filmed in the Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In 1982, Murphy made his big-screen debut in the film &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; with Nick Nolte. &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; proved to be a hit when it was released during the Christmas season of 1982. Nolte was scheduled to host the December 11, 1982, Christmas episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, but became too ill to host, so Murphy took over. He became the only cast member to host while still a regular. Murphy opened the show with the phrase, &quot;Live from New York, it&#x27;s the Eddie Murphy Show!&quot; The following year, Murphy starred in &quot;Trading Places&quot; with fellow &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus Dan Aykroyd. The movie marked the first of Murphy&#x27;s collaborations with director John Landis, who also directed Murphy in &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988) and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; (1994). &quot;Trading Places&quot; was an even greater box office success than &quot;48 Hrs.&quot;

Murphy appeared in &quot;Best Defense&quot; (1984), co-starring Dudley Moore. Credited as a &quot;Strategic Guest Star&quot;, the former was added to the film after an original version was completed but tested poorly with audiences. &quot;Best Defense&quot; was both a major financial and critical disappointment. When he hosted &quot;SNL&quot;, Murphy joined the chorus of those bashing &quot;Best Defense&quot;, calling it &quot;the worst movie in the history of everything&quot;. The same year, he won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording for his album &quot;Eddie Murphy: Comedian&quot; (he has been nominated for a total of three Grammy Awards). Murphy starred in the successful action comedy film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984). The film was Murphy&#x27;s first solo leading role. &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; grossed over $230 million at the U.S. box office, becoming the highest-grossing film released in 1984, the highest-grossing comedy of all time, and the highest-grossing &quot;R&quot;-rated film of all time; , it was 46th in the list of all-time U.S. box office grossers after adjusting for inflation (third-highest amongst &quot;R&quot;-rated films). Murphy was offered a part in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986), a role that, after being heavily re-written from comic relief to love interest, ultimately went to Catherine Hicks.

By this time, Murphy&#x27;s near-exclusive contract with Paramount Pictures rivaled &quot;Star Trek&quot; as Paramount&#x27;s most lucrative franchise. By 1986, he launched Eddie Murphy Television Enterprises with a deal at Paramount Television. In his next subsequent role, he starred in the supernatural comedy &quot;The Golden Child&quot; (1986). Although &quot;The Golden Child&quot; performed well at the box office, the movie was not as well received as &quot;48 Hrs.&quot;, &quot;Trading Places&quot;, and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;. &quot;The Golden Child&quot; was considered a change of pace for Murphy because of the supernatural setting as opposed to the &quot;street smart&quot; settings of his previous efforts. Not long afterward, he reprised his role of Axel Foley in the Tony Scott-directed &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; (1987). It was a box-office success, grossing almost $300 million worldwide. By the end of the decade, Murphy was Hollywood&#x27;s biggest box office star. In 1988, Murphy and his Eddie Murphy Television Enterprises company had struck a deal with CBS.

===1990–1998: Commercial decline and rebound===
From 1989 onward, critical praise for Murphy&#x27;s films declined; it hit a low point with the critically panned &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; (1994), a movie that Murphy denounced during an appearance on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;. Box-office receipts also declined compared to his previous films, although he did find some box office success with &quot;Another 48 Hrs.&quot; (1990) and &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1992). On &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; (1989), Murphy worked as director, producer and star, as well as sharing co-writer duties with his brother, Charlie Murphy. The film featured Murphy&#x27;s comic idols Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx in supporting roles.

During this period, Murphy was criticized by filmmaker Spike Lee for not using his status to help Black actors break into film. However, as Murphy&#x27;s prominence increased, his films (especially those he produced) often had a mainly Black cast (examples include &quot;Coming to America&quot;, &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;, &quot;Boomerang&quot;, &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;). Many Black actors who later received greater recognition made early appearances in Murphy&#x27;s films, such as Damon Wayans in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, Halle Berry and Martin Lawrence in &quot;Boomerang&quot;, Samuel L. Jackson and Cuba Gooding Jr. in &quot;Coming to America&quot;, Dave Chappelle in &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, and Chris Rock in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;. Naming &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; as his favorite comedy, Rock regards Murphy&#x27;s performance in the film as being so great, he had &quot;been robbed of an Oscar&quot;, adding that his various performances were &quot;Peter Sellers-esque&quot;.

Although Murphy has enjoyed commercial success since &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, he did not participate in the making of the &quot;Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live&quot; retrospective book by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller (2002), nor did he ever attend cast reunions or anniversary specials until his appearance on the &quot;SNL&quot; 40th anniversary special. Murphy told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; he had distanced himself from the show because he was angry with David Spade over the latter&#x27;s joke about Murphy&#x27;s career during a segment on &quot;SNL;&quot; he was also angry with Lorne Michaels and the production staff for allowing the joke in the first place. Murphy and Spade have since reconciled.

===1998–2018: Family-friendly films and &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;===

Murphy followed &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; with a series of successful family-friendly movies like &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998), &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; (also 1998) and its 2001 sequel, the &quot;Shrek&quot; series, &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; (also 2003), along with &quot;Nutty Professor II: The Klumps&quot; (2000). However, most of his movies meant for more adult audiences performed moderately; &quot;Metro&quot; (1997), &quot;I Spy&quot; (2002), and &quot;Showtime&quot; (2002) all grossed less than $40 million domestically, &quot;Holy Man&quot; (1998) performed poorly, grossing less than $13 million, and &quot;The Adventures of Pluto Nash&quot; (2002) is on record as one of the biggest financial failures all time, grossing just $7 million worldwide on a reported massive $110 million budget. An exception to this run of poorly received adult-themed films was the Frank Oz comedy &quot;Bowfinger&quot; (1999), also starring Steve Martin. The film garnered generally positive critical reviews and grossed $98 million at the box-office.

Murphy starred in the motion picture version of the Broadway musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (2006) as soul singer James &quot;Thunder&quot; Early. Murphy won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Broadcast Film Critics Association Award in that category. Several reviews for the film highlighted Murphy&#x27;s performance while he received some pre-release Academy Awards buzz. Murphy was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor on January 23, 2007, but lost to Alan Arkin for his performance in &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;—it was speculated that one of the reasons Murphy lost out on winning the Academy Award was the negative reviews of his subsequent film &quot;Norbit&quot;, released in early February 2007. Murphy notoriously exited the 79th Academy Awards as soon as Arkin was announced the winner. In 2007, Murphy was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Murphy co-starred in &quot;Tower Heist&quot; (2011), directed by Brett Ratner, alongside Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, and Casey Affleck. Murphy played a thief who joins a group of hardworking men who find out they have fallen victim to a wealthy businessman&#x27;s Ponzi scheme, and conspire to rob his high-rise residence. It was reported in 2011 that Murphy would host the 84th Academy Awards in 2012. However, he dropped out of his hosting duties on November 9, 2011, in the wake of the Brett Ratner scandal. On March 8, 2014, it was announced that Murphy would team up with &quot;Boomerang&quot; co-star Halle Berry in a new film titled &quot;Miles and Me&quot;. The film was also set to star Laurence Fishburne and was set to begin pre-production in 2014 from Paramount Pictures. No other word was released about the film or who else was attached. On March 15, 2015, it was announced that Murphy would play comedian Richard Pryor&#x27;s father, LeRoy Pryor, in the upcoming biopic directed by Lee Daniels with Mike Epps playing Pryor; as of 2019, the project remains in development hell.

In February 2015, Murphy attended the &quot;Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special&quot; where Chris Rock introduced him in a special tribute dedicated to him. Murphy was greeted with an enthusiastic standing ovation from the crowd of comedians and stars, however he received criticism for his brief appearance, declining to tell any jokes, and for not reprising his iconic &quot;SNL&quot; characters. On October 15, 2015, Murphy was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Those who honored Murphy at the event included Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Trevor Noah, George Lopez, Kevin Nealon, Kathy Griffin, Tracy Morgan, Joe Piscopo, Jay Pharoah and Dick Gregory. Murphy co-starred with actress Britt Robertson in the drama &quot;Mr. Church&quot; (2016) for which he received critical acclaim.

===2019–present: Career resurgence===

In October 2019, Murphy produced and starred in &quot;Dolemite Is My Name&quot; as Rudy Ray Moore. The film was distributed on Netflix and received overwhelming critical acclaim. The film holds a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes with the critics consensus reading, &quot;Eddie Murphy makes &quot;Dolemite Is My Name&quot; just as bold, brash, and ultimately hard to resist as its subject.&quot; For his work, Murphy received a Golden Globe Award nomination for the film.

In December 2019, Murphy returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to promote &quot;Dolemite&quot;; this was his first time hosting since 1984. His hosting duties received overwhelming acclaim from audiences and critics alike, making it the highest watched episode since 2008 when Tina Fey played Sarah Palin. Comedians Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan, and Kenan Thompson welcomed Murphy back in the opening monologue. Murphy went on to reprise his popular &quot;SNL&quot; characters such as Mr. Robinson, Gumby, Buckwheat, and Velvet Jones. Murphy won his first ever Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for hosting the episode. Murphy and most of the cast reprised their roles in the &quot;Coming to America&quot; sequel &quot;Coming2 America&quot;, which was released in March 2021.

On December 6, 2013, it was announced that Murphy would star in the fourth film of the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; series. Brett Ratner was at the time set to direct the film, Jerry Bruckheimer was confirmed to produce the film, and Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec would write. In a June 2014 interview, Murphy discussed the plot of the film, saying it would take place and film in Detroit, bringing in an estimated $56.6 million to the state of Michigan. On June 14, 2016, it was confirmed that Murphy was still set to reprise his role as Axel Foley in a fourth film. In December 2019, it was reported that the film had moved to Netflix, where &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot;, which was ultimately directed by Mark Molloy, was released on July 3, 2024.

In September 2021, Murphy and his Eddie Murphy Productions company signed a deal with Amazon Studios. On March 31, 2022, it was announced that Murphy will portray George Clinton in an untitled biopic, with John Davis and Catherine Davis producing through Davis Entertainment.

In June 2024, Murphy and Bruckheimer revealed that a fifth &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; film was already in development. Murphy will reprise his role as Donkey in &quot;Shrek 5&quot;, set for release on July 1, 2026.

===Singing career===
Murphy is also a singer, having frequently provided background vocals to songs released by the Bus Boys; the song &quot;(The Boys Are) Back in Town&quot; was featured in &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; and Murphy&#x27;s comedy special &quot;Eddie Murphy Delirious&quot;. As a solo artist, Murphy had two hit singles, &quot;Party All the Time&quot; (produced by Rick James) and &quot;Put Your Mouth on Me&quot;, during the latter half of the 1980s. He had started singing earlier in his career, with the songs &quot;Boogie in Your Butt&quot; and &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot;, the latter being a parody of Barbra Streisand&#x27;s and Donna Summer&#x27;s 1979 song, &quot;No More Tears&quot;. Both songs appeared on his 1982 self-titled comedy album. &quot;Party All the Time&quot; was featured on Murphy&#x27;s debut album &quot;How Could It Be&quot; (1985), which included a minor follow-up R&amp;B hit in the title track, a duet with vocalist Crystal Blake. This track was written by Rusty Hamilton and was produced by Stevie Wonder&#x27;s cousin Aquil Fudge after a brief falling out with Rick James. In 2004, VH-1 and &quot;Blender&quot; voted &quot;Party All the Time&quot; number seven among the &quot;50 Worst Songs of All-Time&quot;. Sharam used a sample of the song for the UK No.8 hit &quot;PATT (Party All the Time)&quot; in 2006. &quot;Put Your Mouth on Me&quot; appeared on Murphy&#x27;s 1989 follow-up album, &quot;So Happy&quot;.

Murphy recorded the album &quot;Love&#x27;s Alright&quot; in the early 1990s. He performed in a music video of the single &quot;Whatzupwitu&quot;, featuring Michael Jackson. He recorded a duet with Shabba Ranks called &quot;I Was a King&quot;. In 1992, Murphy appeared in the music video for Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Remember the Time&quot; alongside Magic Johnson and Iman. Though uncredited, Murphy provided vocal work on &quot;SNL&quot; castmate Joe Piscopo&#x27;s 1985 comedy single, &quot;The Honeymooners Rap&quot;. Piscopo impersonated Jackie Gleason on the single, while Murphy provided an imitation of Art Carney. In &quot;Coming to America&quot;, he imitated Jackie Wilson when he sang &quot;To Be Loved&quot;, but because the character he was playing had a thick accent, he had to sing it in character; he also performed in the same film as the character Randy Watson, a small time club singer, a role he reprised in the 2021 sequel &quot;Coming 2 America&quot;.

Murphy performed several songs in the &quot;Shrek&quot; film franchise. In the first film, he performed a version of the Monkees&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; in the film&#x27;s final scene; in &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, he performed Ricky Martin&#x27;s hit &quot;Livin&#x27; La Vida Loca&quot;, along with co-star Antonio Banderas; Murphy performed &quot;Thank You (Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Again)&quot; for &quot;Shrek the Third&quot;, once again with Banderas. In 2013, he released his first single in many years titled &quot;Red Light&quot;, a reggae song featuring Snoop Dogg. He is also working on a new album titled &quot;9&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and children===

Murphy had two sons in quick succession around the end of the 1980s: Eric (born July 10, 1989) with then-girlfriend Paulette McNeely; and Christian (born November 29, 1990), with then-girlfriend Tamara Hood.

Murphy began a longtime romantic relationship with Nicole Mitchell after meeting her in 1988 at an NAACP Image Awards show. They lived together for almost two years before getting married at the Grand Ballroom of the Plaza Hotel in New York City on March 18, 1993. Murphy and Mitchell have five children together: Bria (born November 18, 1989), Myles Mitchell (born November 7, 1992), Shayne Audra (born October 10, 1994), Zola Ivy (born December 24, 1999), and Bella Zahra (born January 29, 2002). In August 2005, Mitchell filed for divorce, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. The divorce was finalized on April 17, 2006.

Following his divorce from Mitchell, in 2006, Murphy began dating former Spice Girl Melanie Brown, who became pregnant and claimed the child was Murphy&#x27;s. When questioned about the pregnancy in December 2006, by &quot;RTL Boulevard&quot;, Murphy told Dutch reporter Matthijs Kleyn, &quot;I don&#x27;t know whose child that is until it comes out and has a blood test. You shouldn&#x27;t jump to conclusions, sir.&quot; Brown gave birth to a baby girl, Angel Iris Murphy Brown, on Murphy&#x27;s 46th birthday, April 3, 2007.

On June 22, 2007, representatives for Brown announced that a DNA test had confirmed Murphy was the father. Brown had stated in an interview that Murphy has not sought a relationship with Angel, although it was later reported in 2010 that Murphy was getting to know her.

Murphy exchanged vows with film producer Tracey Edmonds, former wife of Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, on January 1, 2008, in a private ceremony on an island off Bora Bora. On January 16, 2008, the couple released a statement describing the ceremony as a symbolic union: &quot;After much consideration and discussion, we have jointly decided that we will forgo having a legal ceremony as it is not necessary to define our relationship further&quot; and that they would remain friends instead of pursue a further romantic relationship. Murphy bought property on Long Island, New York, later that year.

On May 3, 2016, Murphy had a daughter Izzy Oona by Australian model Paige Butcher, whom he had been dating since 2012. Murphy and Butcher are also parents of a son, Max Charles, born in November 30, 2018. In September 2018 they became engaged to be married. Their son&#x27;s middle name pays tribute to Murphy&#x27;s late brother, Charlie, who died of leukemia in 2017. In July 2024, they married in a private ceremony in Anguilla.

===Philanthropy===
Murphy has donated money to the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, as well as cancer, education, creative arts, family support, health, and homeless charities. He has donated to the Martin Luther King Jr. Center, and $100,000 to the Screen Actors&#x27; Guild&#x27;s strike relief fund.

===Religious beliefs===
Murphy was baptized Catholic. It was reported in a 2011 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that Murphy remarked, &quot;... I don&#x27;t want to have no religion. I have Christian-based values and beliefs.&quot;

===Eddie Murphy Rule===
Section 746 of the 2010 US Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits securities trading based on non-public information misappropriated from a government source, is informally known as the &quot;Eddie Murphy Rule&quot;. The term relates to the plot in the 1984 film &quot;Trading Places&quot; where illegally acquired market information was doctored and used (albeit not illegally in 1984) to short sell frozen orange juice concentrate.

===Prostitute incident===
On May 2, 1997, Murphy was stopped by police in West Hollywood, California, at 4:45 a.m. with Atisone Seiuli, a transgender prostitute, in his car. His publicist, Paul Block, denied that Murphy had intended to pay Seiuli for sex, saying that Murphy was only giving her a ride home. Murphy was not charged with any crime, but the incident caused him a number of public relation problems.

<text>Coming to America is a 1988 American romantic comedy film directed by John Landis, based on a story originally created by Eddie Murphy, written by David Sheffield and Barry W. Blaustein, and starring Murphy (in various roles), Arsenio Hall (also in various roles), James Earl Jones, John Amos, Madge Sinclair, and Shari Headley. It tells the story of Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African nation of Zamunda who travels to the United States in the hopes of finding a woman he can marry and will love him for who he is, not for his status or for having been trained to please him. The film was released in the United States on June 29, 1988.

In 1989, a pilot for a planned spin-off television series was made, although this was never picked up for a series.

A sequel, &quot;Coming 2 America&quot;, was released on March 4, 2021.

==Plot==
In the wealthy African nation of Zamunda, crown prince Akeem Joffer grows weary of his pampered lifestyle on his 21st birthday and wishes to do more for himself. When his parents King Jaffe and Queen Aoleon present him with an arranged bride-to-be, Akeem takes action. Seeking an independent woman who loves him for himself and not his social status, Akeem and his best friend/personal aide, Semmi, travel to the New York City borough of Queens and rent a squalid tenement in the neighborhood of Long Island City under the guise of poor foreign students.

Beginning their search for Akeem&#x27;s bride, they are invited by local barber shop owner Clarence to a rally raising money for the neighborhood. During the rally, Akeem encounters Lisa McDowell, who possesses all the qualities he is looking for in a woman. Upon his insistence, he and Semmi get entry-level jobs working at the local fast-food restaurant called McDowell&#x27;s, a McDonald&#x27;s knockoff owned by widower Cleo McDowell, Lisa&#x27;s father.

Akeem&#x27;s attempts to win Lisa&#x27;s love are complicated by Lisa&#x27;s lazy and obnoxious boyfriend Darryl Jenks whose father owns Soul Glo (a Jheri curl–like hairstyling aid). After Darryl announces their engagement—without Lisa&#x27;s consent—to their families, she starts dating Akeem, who claims that he comes from a family of poor goat herders.

Although Akeem thrives on hard work and learning how commoners live, Semmi is not comfortable with living in such meager conditions. After a dinner date with Lisa is thwarted when Semmi furnishes their apartment with a hot tub and other luxuries, Akeem confiscates his money and donates it to two homeless men. Semmi wires a telegraph to King Jaffe for more money, prompting the Joffers to travel to Queens to find him.

Cleo initially disapproves of Akeem as he believes he is poor and therefore not good enough for his daughter. He becomes ecstatic when he discovers that Akeem is actually an extremely wealthy prince, after meeting his parents. When Akeem discovers that his parents have arrived in New York, he and Lisa go to the McDowell residence to lie low and Cleo welcomes them while driving away Darryl. After Cleo&#x27;s bond with Akeem is ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Zamundan entourage, Lisa later becomes angry and confused that Akeem lied to her about his identity. Akeem explains that he wanted her to love him for who, not what, he is, even offering to renounce his throne. Still hurt and angry, Lisa refuses to marry him. Despondent, Akeem resigns himself to the arranged marriage. As they leave, Jaffe is reprimanded by Aoleon for clinging to outdated traditions instead of thinking of their son&#x27;s happiness.

At the wedding procession, a still-heartbroken Akeem becomes surprised when his veiled bride is Lisa herself. Following the ceremony, they ride happily in a carriage to the cheers of Zamundans. Witnessing such splendor, Lisa is both surprised and touched by the fact that Akeem would have given it up just for her. Akeem offers again to abdicate if she does not want this life, but Lisa playfully declines.

Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy reprise their roles as Mortimer and Randolph Duke respectively from Landis&#x27;s Murphy-starring comedy film &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983) who have become homeless after the events of the film and receive money from Akeem. A segment of the &quot;Trading Places&quot; score can be heard during their scene.

As previously indicated, &quot;Coming to America&quot; features Murphy and Hall in several different roles, of different races and genders. Following the success of this film, this became a Murphy staple, as seen in four later films: &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot; (1995); &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1996) and its sequel (2000); and &quot;Norbit&quot; (2007).

==Production==
&quot;Coming to America&quot; reunited star Eddie Murphy with director John Landis. The two men had previously worked together on the comedy hit &quot;Trading Places&quot;. Landis recalled the differences in working with Murphy on the two movies: &quot;The guy on &quot;Trading Places&quot; was young and full of energy and curious and funny and fresh and great. The guy on &quot;Coming to America&quot; was the pig of the world... But I still think he&#x27;s wonderful in the movie.&quot; Murphy said:
Despite the experience, Landis and Murphy collaborated again six years later on &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot;.

South African chorus Ladysmith Black Mambazo sings &quot;Mbube&quot; during the opening sequence (the song also known as &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;). The group has since recorded several different versions of &quot;Mbube;&quot; however, the version heard in &quot;Coming to America&quot; had not been released on its soundtrack or on CD as of 2006. A promotional song for the film, also titled &quot;Coming to America&quot;, was written and performed by The System.

Murphy received a personal salary of $8 million for his work on the film, plus 15% of film rentals. Landis received $600,000, plus 10% of gross receipts. Landis&#x27;s calling card (&quot;See You Next Wednesday&quot;) appears as an &quot;easter egg&quot; within the film, on a science-fiction movie poster in the subway station after Lisa storms off the train.

==Release==
Paramount cancelled press screenings of the film after initial negative reactions to a press screening in New York City.

===Box office===
Released on June 29, 1988, by Paramount Pictures in the United States, it was a commercial box-office success, both domestically and worldwide. The film debuted at number one with $21,404,420 from 2,064 screens, for a five-day total of $28,409,497. The film made $128,152,301 in the United States and ended up with a worldwide total of $288,752,301. It was the highest earning film that year for the studio and the third-highest-grossing film at the United States box office.

It opened a month later in the UK and earned $7,712,622 during its seven-week run. It opened on September 2 in West Germany, where it debuted at number one with $3,715,791 from 297 screens. It ended its run after 13 weeks with $15,743,447. Several contemporary articles stated that the worldwide gross for the movie was $350 million.

===Reception===
&quot;Coming To America&quot; received positive reviews upon release.
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Sheila Benson in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it a &quot;hollow and wearying Eddie Murphy fairy tale&quot; and bemoans, &quot;That an Eddie Murphy movie would come to this.&quot; Vincent Canby in &quot;The New York Times&quot; was also critical of the writing, calling it a &quot;possibly funny idea&quot; but suggesting the screenplay had escaped before it was ready. Canby viewed the film as essentially a romantic comedy but said the romantic elements fell flat, and the film instead goes for broad slapstick. Kathleen Carroll of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; called the film &quot;an adorably amusing upscale fairy tale, an endearingly romantic comedy which has all the fabulous fake opulence of an old-fashioned Hollywood musical as well as the traditionally sappy happy ending.&quot; Siskel &amp; Ebert had mixed opinions on the film. Siskel enjoyed the acting from Murphy and Hall but Ebert was disappointed that Murphy did not bring his usual more lively performance, and Ebert was also critical of the unoriginal script. Siskel, in print, reviewed the film more enthusiastically, giving it three and a half stars out of four, and describing it as &quot;a sweet, oft-told story&quot;, adding that &quot;Murphy and Hall add a number of very sharp supporting roles hidden by makeup to add spice to the general level of gentleness.&quot;

===Awards===
The film was nominated for two Oscars: Best Costume Design for Deborah Nadoolman Landis and Best Makeup for Rick Baker, who designed the makeup effects for both Murphy&#x27;s and Arsenio Hall&#x27;s multiple supporting characters.

===Lawsuit===
The film was the subject of the &quot;Buchwald v. Paramount&quot; civil suit, which the humorist Art Buchwald filed in 1990 against the film&#x27;s producers on the grounds that the film&#x27;s idea was stolen from his 1982 script treatment about a rich, despotic African potentate who comes to America for a state visit. Paramount had optioned the treatment from Buchwald, and John Landis was attached as director and Eddie Murphy as the lead, but after two years of development hell Paramount abandoned the project in March 1985. In 1987, Paramount began working on &quot;Coming to America&quot; based on a story by Eddie Murphy. Buchwald won the breach of contract action and the court ordered monetary damages. The parties later settled the case out-of-court before an appeal going to trial.

In August 2022, Paramount filed a lawsuit against JMC Pop Ups LLC for creating a temporary version of McDowell&#x27;s, the fictional fast food restaurant similar to McDonald&#x27;s, via the Copyright Claims Board, a tribunal created in 2020 to deal with such matters. The pop up restaurant had operated in Springfield, Virginia, and Cherry Hill, New Jersey, in 2022 prior to the suit. McDowell&#x27;s was featured in both the original movie and its sequel.

== Home media ==
&quot;Coming to America&quot; was released on DVD on June 3, 2008. The Film was released on Blu-Ray on June 3, 2008, and re-released on Blu-Ray on January 1, 2013 and on June 12, 2018. &quot;Coming To America&quot; was released on 4K Blu-Ray on December 1, 2020.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack to the film was released on LP, cassette and CD. The songs &quot;Coming to America&quot; by The System, &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot; by The Cover Girls and &quot;Come into My Life&quot; by Laura Branigan and Joe Esposito were released as singles from the album. &quot;That&#x27;s The Way It Is&quot; by Mel &amp; Kim had been released as a single in the UK, before the film&#x27;s release, in February 1988, and became a top ten hit. It was released as a single in the US at the time of the film&#x27;s release.

==Legacy==
===Television pilot===
A television pilot of a weekly sitcom version of the film was produced for CBS, following the film&#x27;s success, starring Tommy Davidson as Prince Tariq, and Paul Bates reprising his role as Oha. The pilot went unsold, but was televised on July 4, 1989, as part of the &quot;CBS Summer Playhouse&quot; pilot anthology series.

===Remakes===
A Tamil film, &quot;My Dear Marthandan&quot;, was produced based on the plot of &quot;Coming to America&quot;. A Hong Kong film, &quot;The Fun, the Luck &amp; the Tycoon&quot;, also has the same plot.

===Influences in music===
The melody heard in the bathroom scene, where Prince Akeem is being washed by female servants, was sampled in Snoop Dogg&#x27;s 2006 song &quot;That&#x27;s That&quot; featuring R. Kelly; a remix of the song featuring American rapper Nas includes a woman&#x27;s voice saying &quot;the royal penis is clean, Your Highness&quot;, a line taken from the same scene. The supergroup The Randy Watson Experience is named after the character Randy Watson.

=== Cultural impact ===
The movie has been described as having a &quot;cult following&quot; years after its release, despite negative press, with one of the highest-grossing box office of the year it was released, as well as one of the highest-grossing films featuring a predominantly African-American cast.

==Sequel==

In early 2017, an announcement was publicized which addressed the impending production of a sequel to the film. Kevin Misher was named as producer, and Sheffield and Blaustein, the original screenwriters, were also attached to the project. However, the participation of lead actors Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall was left undefined.

On January 11, 2019, it was announced that the sequel was moving forward with Murphy reprising his role and Craig Brewer as director (having previously worked with Murphy on the Netflix film &quot;Dolemite Is My Name&quot;). Arsenio Hall, Shari Headley, John Amos, Paul Bates and James Earl Jones returning for the sequel as well. Wesley Snipes signed on for a role in the film. It was reported that Leslie Jones and American rapper Rick Ross were joining the cast in undisclosed roles.

The film was scheduled to be theatrically released on December 18, 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon Studios bought the distribution rights and released it digitally on Amazon Prime Video on March 4, 2021.

<text>The Tucker 48, commonly but incorrectly referred to as the Tucker Torpedo, was an automobile conceived by Preston Tucker while in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and briefly produced in Chicago, Illinois, in 1948. Only 51 cars were made including their prototype before the company was forced to declare bankruptcy and cease all operations on March 3, 1949, due to negative publicity initiated by the news media, a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and a heavily publicized stock fraud trial (in which the allegations were proven baseless and led to a full acquittal). Tucker suspected that the Big Three automakers and Michigan Senator Homer S. Ferguson had a role in the Tucker Corporation&#x27;s demise.

The 48&#x27;s original proposed price was said to be $1,000, but the actual selling price was closer to $4,000.

The 1988 movie &quot;&quot; is based on the saga surrounding the car&#x27;s production. The film&#x27;s director, Francis Ford Coppola, is a Tucker owner and displays his vehicle on the grounds of his winery.

The Tucker 48 is often referred to as the Tucker Torpedo. However, the Torpedo was actually a prototype, and the name was never used for the production model, which was officially called the &quot;Tucker 48&quot;.

== Development ==
After World War II, the public was ready for new car designs, but the Big Three Detroit automakers had not developed any new models since 1941 because their resources had been diverted towards producing war materiel. This provided opportunities for new, small automakers which could develop new cars faster than the huge legacy automakers. Studebaker was the first to introduce an all-new postwar model series in the ponton style which had just gone mainstream, but Tucker took a different track, designing a safe car with innovative features and modern styling. His specifications called for a water-cooled aluminum block flat-6 rear engine, disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, fuel injection, the location of all instruments within reach of the steering wheel, seat belts and a padded dashboard.
Before the war&#x27;s end, Preston Tucker began working on plans for his new automobile. In the summer of 1944, he hired noted car designer George S. Lawson to style his new automobile. Lawson worked on the project for over a year and a half before his design debuted publicly, beginning about February 1946 and found as late as a year later in March 1947. Lawson was named the Tucker Corporation&#x27;s &quot;chief stylist&quot; in February 1946, immediately upon the company&#x27;s formation.

In December 1946, Lawson resigned from the company after a disagreement with Preston Tucker, and shortly thereafter, stylist Alex Tremulis of local Chicago design firm Tammen &amp; Denison was hired and furthered the development of the Lawson design. Tucker gave Tammen &amp; Denison and Tremulis a three-month contract, which expired in March 1947 and was not renewed. The culmination of Tremulis&#x27; efforts during this phase of design development was featured in a full-page advertisement run in numerous national newspapers in March 1947. Tremulis&#x27; design was based directly upon the work of George Lawson, but incorporated his own artistic flair.

Simultaneous with Tremulis&#x27; departure, Preston Tucker hired a team of five designers (Read Viemeister, Budd Steinhilber, Tucker Madawick, Hal Bergstrom and Phillip Egan) from the New York design firm J. Gordon Lippincott, who updated Tremulis&#x27; design just as Tremulis had done with Lawson&#x27;s.
After a month&#x27;s absence, Tremulis was rehired and the two independent design groups developed full-size clay models side by side in direct competition. Surviving photographs of the two models reveal that Tremulis&#x27; clay design remained unchanged from his March 1947 advertisement proposal and was not chosen for production. The passenger side of the Lippincott team&#x27;s clay model (they submitted two designs), which incorporated the side profile developed by Tremulis prior to their arrival, was chosen virtually intact for the production automobile&#x27;s styling.

The Tucker 48&#x27;s evolving appearance in the company&#x27;s press releases and other promotional materials, combined with suggestive statements such as &quot;15 years of testing produced the car of the year&quot;—despite no running prototype existing &quot;at the time&quot;—were instrumental in the SEC filing mail and conspiracy fraud charges against Preston Tucker. The SEC, however, failed to prove its case, and Tucker was acquitted of all charges in January 1950. However, the company never recovered.

Tremulis, like George Lawson, was eventually named the Tucker Corporation&#x27;s &quot;chief stylist&quot;, although the first reference to him holding this position does not appear until 1948, after the Tucker 48&#x27;s exterior styling was completed.

The Tucker automobile was originally named the &quot;Torpedo&quot;, but was changed to &quot;Tucker &#x27;48&quot; around the time of Lawson&#x27;s departure and Tremulis&#x27; arrival, reportedly because Tucker did not want to remind the public of the horrors of World War II. Despite the name change, the Tucker 48 is still often referred to as the Tucker Torpedo. Alex Tremulis has claimed responsibility for dubbing the first prototype automobile the &quot;Tin Goose&quot;, a name which is presently used in an affectionate manner but at the time was considered derogatory.

==Innovative design features==

The Tucker was a pioneer in terms of engineering and safety features. A rear engine, rear wheel drive configuration had been employed in Tatras and Volkswagens, and headlamps that turned with the front wheels had been available since the 1920s, but they would have been firsts for a modern American production car. The most recognizable feature of the Tucker 48, was a third directional headlamp. Centrally located, it would activate at steering angles of greater than 10 degrees to light the car&#x27;s path around corners. At the time, 17 states had laws against cars having more than two headlights. Tucker fabricated a cover for the center light for use in these states.

The car had a rear engine and rear-wheel drive. A perimeter frame surrounded the vehicle for crash protection, as well as a roll bar integrated into the roof. The steering box was behind the front axle to protect the driver in a front-end accident. The instrument panel and all controls were within easy reach of the steering wheel, and the dashboard was padded for safety. The windshield was made of shatterproof glass and designed to pop out in a collision to protect occupants. The car&#x27;s parking brake had a separate key so it could be locked in place to prevent theft. The doors extended into the roof, to ease entry and exit. Each Tucker that was built differed somewhat from the previous car, as each car built was basically a &quot;prototype&quot; where design features and engineering concepts were tried, improved, or discarded throughout the production cycle. The door releases on the interior of the Tucker came from the Lincoln Zephyr. The steering columns used in the Tucker were donated by Ford and are from the 1941 Lincoln. Preston Tucker held a patent for a collapsible steering column design. A glove box was added to the front door panels instead of the more conventional location in the dashboard to provide space for the &quot;crash chamber&quot; that the Tucker is now famous for. This is a padded area ahead of the passenger seat, free from obstructions, providing the front seat passengers an area to protect themselves in the event of an accident. The engine and transmission were mounted on a separate subframe which was secured with only six bolts. The entire drive train could thus be lowered and removed from the car in minutes. Tucker envisioned loaner engines being quickly swapped in for service in just 30 minutes.

Tucker envisioned several other innovations that were later abandoned. Magnesium wheels, disc brakes, fuel injection, self-sealing tubeless tires, and a direct-drive torque converter transmission were all evaluated or tested, but were dropped on the final prototype due to cost, engineering complexity, and lack of time to develop.

Tucker initially tried to develop an innovative engine, with help from Ben Parsons, then owner and president of the Fuelcharger Corporation, and would later be Tucker&#x27;s VP of engineering. It was a flat-6 cylinder with hemispherical combustion chambers, fuel injection, and overhead valves operated by oil pressure rather than a camshaft. An oil pressure distributor was mounted in line with the ignition distributor and delivered appropriately timed direct oil pressure to open each valve at proper intervals. The oil pressure fed to each valve was &quot;timed&quot; by intake and exhaust eccentrics and measured by spring-loaded plungers. It had large pistons built of aluminum and magnesium castings with steel-plated cylinder linings. This unique engine was designed to idle at 100 rpm and cruise at 250–1200 rpm through the use of direct-drive torque converters on each driving wheel instead of a transmission. It was designed to produce almost 1 and of torque at only 1800 rpm. When cruising at , it would only turn at approximately 1000 rpm. These features would have been auto industry firsts in 1948, but as engine development proceeded, problems appeared. Six prototypes of the 589 engine were built, but it was installed only in the test chassis and the first prototype.

==Troubled premiere==
The world premiere of the much-hyped Tucker 48 car was set for June 19, 1947. Over 3,000 people showed up at the factory in Chicago for lunch, a train tour of the plant, and the unveiling of the first prototype. The unveiling appeared doomed, however, as last-minute problems cropped up. The night before the premiere, two of the prototype&#x27;s independent suspension arms snapped under the car&#x27;s weight. (The prototype was extremely heavy, much heavier than the other 48s.) Minor engine problems were fixed, and the car was presentable by the time of the premiere. However, the experimental 589 engine was extremely loud. Tucker told the band to play as loud as possible to drown out the noise. Additionally the high-voltage starter required the use of outside power to get the engine started, so Tucker had the engineering team keep the engine running during the entire event, fearing that the public would see how much effort was required to get the engine started. As the car was driven on to the platform, the liquid coolant boiled over and some steam escaped from the car, but no one seemed to notice.

Drew Pearson, one of the top newspaper columnists of his time, reported publicly that the car was a fraud because it could not go backward and it went &quot;goose-geese&quot; going down the road. Although this problem was limited to the first prototype only, a symptom of the speed with which the first car was put together, the damage to the car&#x27;s reputation was done, and a storm of negative media followed.

Tucker suffered another setback when his bids to obtain two steel mills to provide raw materials for his cars were rejected by the War Assets Administration under a shroud of questionable politics.

==Continued development==
=== Engine ===

Tucker had promised , but his innovative engine was not working out. The valve train proved problematic and the engine only produced approximately . The high oil pressure required a 24-volt electrical system, up to 60 volts to get it started, and a long cranking time at start-up. Additionally, the oil pressure required to maintain valve function was not achieved until the engine was turning at higher RPM and Tucker&#x27;s engineers struggled with keeping the valve train working at idle and lower speeds/RPM. Having wasted nearly a year trying to make the 589 work, Tucker started looking for alternatives.

The company first tried the Lycoming aircraft engine, but it would not fit in the car&#x27;s rear engine compartment.

An air-cooled flat-6 engine, the Franklin O-335 made by Air Cooled Motors (and originally intended for the Bell 47), fit, and its pleased Tucker. He purchased four samples for $5,000 each, and his engineers converted the engine to water cooling (a decision that has puzzled historians ever since). The Franklin engine was heavily modified by Tucker&#x27;s engineers, including Eddie Offutt and Tucker&#x27;s son Preston, Jr. at his Ypsilanti machine shop. Using an aircraft engine in an automotive application required significant modification; thus, very few parts of the original Franklin engine were retained in the final Tucker engine. This durable modification of the engine was tested at maximum power for 150 hours, the equivalent of , at full throttle.

Tucker quickly bought Air Cooled Motors for $1.8 million to secure the engine source, then canceled all of the company&#x27;s aircraft contracts so its resources could be focused on making automotive engines. This was a significant decision, since at the time of Tucker&#x27;s purchase, Air Cooled Motors held over 65% of post-war U.S. aviation engine production contracts. The loss of income was substantial.

=== Transmission ===

With the horizontal, between-the-wheels 589 motor and its double torque converter(s) (and no reverse) drive system out, Tucker now needed a transmission to mate with the Franklin O-335. This motor was also horizontal, but its driveshaft pointed towards the front of the car. It was discovered, after a few sketches were made, that it was theoretically possible to adapt a previous transmission design intended for front-engine/front wheel drive use. This transmission served as a temporary &quot;fix&quot; for a very real problem for the success of the Tucker.

==== Pre-Selector manual transmission ====
It was discovered that the Cord 810/812&#x27;s Auburn Gear, front-wheel-drive; 4-speed transmission, with the Bendix &quot;Electric Hand&quot; electro-vacuum shifting mechanism, fit the immediate design requirements needed to get the cars built, and on the road; until a future automatic (Tucker-built transmission) was worked out. This transmission was designed originally behind a standard V-8 engine, and pointed forward towards the front of the car, for the front wheels. However, this transmission came with a poor reputation, following its original use, in the Cord 810 automobile. (In 1936, when the Cord 810 made its debut at the New York Automobile show, the transmissions were so problematic that 810 models were mostly shown without any transmission installed. Problems abounded until the last Cord was produced in 1937.) The Cord transmissions, even with refurbishing, were initially inadequate for the power and torque of the O-335 engine. The Cords lacked adequate lubrication and the main shaft was so long that it warped under load (causing gears to pop out of play), and the gear-teeth were quite weak. Nevertheless, in the Tucker, this transmission worked well enough for the new engine configuration; it provided an adequate (albeit fragile) transmission, with a reverse gear. The company then sent several of its staff, including Preston Tucker Jr., on a campaign to buy used Cord transmissions, for reconditioning; a total of 22 used transmissions were acquired from junkyards and used car dealers. These transmissions were taken to the Ypsilanti Machine And Tool Company. After refurbishment, several were mated to the O-335 and found to work, providing four speeds forward and reverse. It was decided, consequently, that the Cord design - nearly 12 years old - would become the &quot;manual transmission&quot; for the 1948 and subsequent Tucker automobiles. About 18 of the 22 Cords were found to be usable and – since newly made Y-1 transmissions were not yet available – were installed in production Tucker vehicles. Several of the cars have survived with Cord transmissions.

==== Ypsilanti Y-1 transmission ====
Ypsilanti Machine and Tool Company, which was tapped to recondition the Cord units, began immediately redesigning the transmission for mass production for Tucker. This new design, which had few similar parts to the Cord transmission, still used the same basic indirect transmission design, but had all new gearing, shafts and electro-vacuum controls. Tucker and his engineers modified it, installing stronger gears and lengthening the case. The modified Cord transmission was named the Tucker Y-1 (Ypsilanti-1) and was installed in a few Tuckers. Both also used a Bendix designed electric vacuum shift mechanism with no mechanical linkage to the steering column shift lever. These EVS&#x27;s had problems of their own with electrical connections and vacuum leaks that hindered shifting, so a new fully mechanical shift design would have been needed, had the Tucker made it into 1949.

==== Tuckermatic drive ====

To solve the transmission problems with a new final transmission design, Warren Rice, creator of the Buick Dynaflow transmission, was consulted. A unique continuously variable transmission called the &quot;Tuckermatic&quot; was designed, which was strong enough to handle the Franklin O-335&#x27;s power and torque. It was a simple but effective design with a single, rear-mounted torque converter and only 27 basic moving parts which was about 90 fewer than normally required for a contemporary automatic. The variable pitch torque converter allowed a continuously variable drive ratio with two forward gears and one reverse gear. 

The only surviving car with a Tuckermatic installed had a standard column shift lever, with a three position quadrant on the steering column. Up was reverse, the middle was neutral, and down was drive. Due to the Tuckermatic&#x27;s design, no lower gear selections were necessary, hence there was no need for a multi gated selector like other automatics.

Three versions of the Tuckermatic were made: the R-1, R-1-2, and R-3 (R for Warren Rice, its designer). The first version, the R-1, was not installed on any of the final cars. It required the engine to be off in order to select a gear. The R-1-2 was improved by adding a layshaft brake to allow gear selection while the engine was running. This version was installed on cars #1026 and 1042 only. The R-3 version had further improvements including a centrifugal clutch to help shifting between forward and reverse even further, and may have been destined for car #1048 for further testing.

Because the external torque converter on the Tuckermatic made the engine-transmission unit longer, the fuel tank in the Tucker 48 had to be moved from behind the rear seat to in front of the dashboard for all Tuckers from car #1026 forward, even though only two of them actually had the Tuckermatic installed. This had the added advantage of improving weight distribution in the car.

==== Other drives contemplated ====
A Borg-Warner based, 3-speed automatic was supposedly tested and was installed on car #1048 at some point when the company was in business, although no histories written ever mentioned such a drive. That said, Tucker ultimately wanted to design his own transmission for the final car, which came to fruition with the Tuckermatic. In 1949, #1048 was sold at the receivership auction without a transmission installed. Today, #1048 has the 4 speed pre-selector transmission that was used on all but two of the original 50 pilot models. It is likely this transmission was privately installed after the auction, and that the unit was the Ypsilanti-built Y-1 transmission.

===Suspension and body===
Suspension designs, especially the front suspension, had to be changed throughout development. Rather than steel springs, Tucker used an elastomeric (rubber) 4-wheel independent suspension similar to what was used on the race cars he developed with Harry Miller at the Indianapolis 500. The rubber elastomers were developed with assistance from the Firestone Tire Company and used a special vulcanization process to produce a specific spring rate.

Tucker&#x27;s suspension designs were plagued with severe stiffness throughout development, which, while good for handling, caused front-wheel corner lift when cornering on uneven surfaces. The test bed and the prototype had a double-rubber disc type front and rear suspension, similar to Miller&#x27;s race cars, which was too weak for the weight of a passenger car. On cars #1001 and 1002 the rear wheels could not be removed without removing the fender or suspension due to the stiffness of the suspension and the rear wheel arch fender design. From car #1003 on, the rear fender shape was changed so the tire could be removed easily. Aside from the fender changes, the rear suspension remained the same from car #1001 on.

Three versions of the front suspension were installed in the cars (aside from the rubber-disc style used on the prototype). Cars #1001–1002 used a rubber torsion tube design, which suffered from severe toe-in during heavy braking. Tucker then switched to a rubber sandwich type suspension (with a rubber block sandwiched between the upper and lower A-arms) on cars #1003–1025, however, this type was severely stiff. Starting on car #1026, Tucker finally settled on a suspension design with a modified version of the rubber torsion tube with the toe-in braking problem corrected.

===Funding and publicity===
Having raised $17,000,000 in a stock issue, one of the first speculative IPOs, Tucker needed more money to continue development of the car. He sold dealerships and distributorships throughout the country. Another money maker was the Tucker Accessories Program. In order to secure a spot on the Tucker waiting list, future buyers could purchase accessories, like seat covers, radio, and luggage, before their car was built. This brought in an additional $2,000,000.

With the final design in place, Preston Tucker took the pre-production cars on the road to show them in towns across the country. The cars were an instant success, with crowds gathering wherever they stopped. One report says Tucker was pulled over by a police officer intent on getting a better look at the car.

To prove the road-worthiness of his cars, Tucker and his engineers ran several cars at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in several endurance tests. During this testing, car #1027 was rolled three times at 95 miles per hour (153 km/h), and the driver (chief mechanic Eddie Offutt) walked away with just bruises. During the crash, the windshield popped out as designed, verifying Tucker&#x27;s safety features were effective. Afterwards, upon replacing a damaged tire, the car started up and was driven off the track.

== SEC investigation and demise ==


One of Tucker&#x27;s most innovative business ideas caused trouble for the company. His Accessories Program raised funds by selling accessories before the car was even in production. After the war, demand for new cars was greater than dealers could supply and most dealers had waiting lists for new cars. Preference was given to returning veterans which meant that non-veterans were bumped down on the waiting lists indefinitely. Tucker&#x27;s program allowed potential buyers who purchased Tucker accessories to obtain a guaranteed spot on the Tucker dealer waiting list for a Tucker 48 car.

This concept was investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney, and led to an indictment of company executives. Although all charges were eventually dropped, the negative publicity destroyed the company and halted production of the car.

== Specific vehicles ==
The first Tucker produced was a prototype sedan, known as the &quot;Tin Goose&quot;. 58 frames and bodies were built at the factory. From these parts, 36 sedans were finished before the factory was closed. After the factory closed, but before liquidation of his assets, Tucker retained a core of employees who assembled an additional 14 sedans, for a total of 50. A 51st car was partially completed. A few of the remaining frames and bodies were built into complete cars specifically #1052 and #1057 (the 1949 prototype with design changes), but the fate of the others is unknown.

In the early 1950s, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, fairgrounds owner Nick Jenin purchased over ten Tuckers, the original Tucker testbed chassis, numerous Tucker parts, photos and documents. He developed a traveling display called &quot;The Fabulous Tuckers&quot;. He hauled the cars and memorabilia around the country for nearly 10 years displaying them at fairgrounds and car shows. His display highlighted the questionable policies and SEC fraud investigation which brought Tucker down.

When the cars appear at auction, which is rare, they command prices attained by only a few marquee cars. In August 2010, Tucker #1045 sold for $1.127 million, while Tucker #1043 went for $2.915 million at an auction in 2012.

== Replica vehicles ==
In 1997, Rob Ida Automotive started work on a replica of the Tucker 48, which culminated in the release and marketing of the 2001 Ida Automotive New Tucker 48. This replica faithfully recreates the Tucker&#x27;s external bodywork, but is built on a hotrod chassis with resin-infused plastic body panels. The paint and wheels reflect modern hotrod styling, and the interior is fully modernized. It is powered by a mid-mounted Cadillac Northstar V8. Its claimed performance is 0–60 in 7 seconds, with a top speed in excess of . Ida has built three Tucker replicas.

==NASCAR==

Tucker #1004 was briefly raced in the NASCAR Grand National series in the early 1950s.

<text>Preston Thomas Tucker (21 September 1903 – 26 December 1956) was an American automobile entrepreneur who developed the innovative Tucker 48 sedan, initially nicknamed the &quot;Tucker Torpedo&quot;, an automobile which introduced many features that have since become widely used in modern cars. 

Production of the Tucker &#x27;48 was shut down on 3 March 1949 amid scandal and controversial accusations of stock fraud, of which Tucker was eventually acquitted. The 1988 movie &quot;&quot; is based on Tucker&#x27;s spirit and the saga surrounding the car&#x27;s production.

==Early life (1903–1933)==

Preston Tucker was born on September 21, 1903, on a peppermint farm near Capac, Michigan. His father was a railroad engineer named Shirl Harvey Tucker (1880-1907), and his mother was Lucille Caroline (née Preston) Tucker (1881-1960). He grew up outside Detroit in the suburb of Lincoln Park, Michigan. Tucker was raised by his mother, a teacher, after his father died of appendicitis when Preston was three or four years old.

First learning to drive at age 11, Tucker was obsessed with automobiles from an early age. At age 16, Preston Tucker began purchasing late model automobiles, repairing and refurbishing them to sell for a profit. He attended the Cass Technical High School in Detroit, but he quit school and landed a job as an office boy for the Cadillac Motor Company, where he used roller skates to make his rounds more efficiently. In 1922, young Tucker joined the Lincoln Park Police Department against the pleas of his mother, his interest stirred by his desire to drive and ride the fast, high-performance police cars and motorcycles. His mother had him removed from the LPPD, pointing out to police officials that at 19, he was below the department&#x27;s minimum required age.

Tucker and his new wife, Vera (married in 1923 at 20), then took over a six-month lease on a gas station near Lincoln Park, running the station together. Vera would run the station during the day while Preston worked on the Ford Motor Company assembly line. After the lease ran out, Tucker quit Ford and returned to the LPPD, but in his first winter back he was banned from driving police vehicles after using a blowtorch to cut a hole in the dashboard of a cruiser to allow engine heat to warm the cabin.

During the last couple of months at the gas station, Tucker began selling Studebaker cars on the side. He met an automobile salesman, Michael Dulian, who later became sales manager for the Tucker Corporation. Dulian hired Tucker as a car salesman at his Detroit dealership. Tucker did very well, but the dealership was a long drive from his Lincoln Park home and so Tucker quit and briefly returned to the LPPD for the last time. A few months later, Dulian, still impressed with Tucker&#x27;s immediate success as a salesman, invited Tucker to move south with him to Memphis, Tennessee, to work as a sales manager. Dulian was transferred a couple of years later, but Tucker stayed in Memphis and was a salesman for Ivor Schmidt (Stutz) and John T. Fisher Motor Company (Chrysler), where he became general sales manager. While managing Chrysler sales in Memphis, Tucker made a connection with Pierce-Arrow. In 1933, Tucker moved to Buffalo, New York, and became regional sales manager for Pierce-Arrow automobiles, but after only two years, he moved back to Detroit and worked as a Dodge salesman for Cass Motor Sales.

==Auto racing and the Indianapolis 500 (1932–1939)==

During the early 1930s, Tucker began an annual one-month trek to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Having a heavy interest in the race cars and their designers, Tucker met Harry Miller, maker of more Indianapolis 500-winning engines than any other during this period. Tucker moved to Indianapolis to be closer to the racing car development scene and worked as the transportation manager for a beer distributor, overseeing the fleet of delivery trucks for the company.

A better engineer than businessman, Miller declared bankruptcy in 1933 and was looking for new opportunities. Tucker persuaded Miller to join him in building race cars, and they formed &quot;Miller and Tucker, Inc.&quot; in 1935. The company&#x27;s first job was building 10 souped-up Ford V-8 racers for Henry Ford. However, the time to develop and test the cars was insufficient, and the steering boxes on all entrants overheated and locked up, causing them to drop out of the race. The design was later perfected by privateers, with examples running at Indy through 1948. Miller and Tucker, Inc. continued race car development and various other ventures until Miller&#x27;s death in 1943. Tucker was close friends with Miller and even helped Miller&#x27;s widow pay for her husband&#x27;s funeral costs. While working with Miller, Tucker met the Chevrolet brothers and chief mechanic/engineer John Eddie Offutt, who would later help Tucker develop and build the first prototype of the Tucker 48. Tucker&#x27;s outgoing personality and his involvement at Indianapolis made him well known in the automotive industry by 1939.

==Tucker Combat Car and the Tucker Gun Turret (1939–1941)==
In late 1937, while recovering in an Indianapolis hospital from an appendectomy, Tucker was reading the news and, learning of looming war in Europe, he got the idea of developing a high-speed armored combat vehicle. In 1939, Tucker moved his family back to Michigan and bought a house and property in Ypsilanti. He remodeled an old barn on his property and began and operated 
a machine shop called the Ypsilanti Machine and Tool Company, planning to use the facility to develop various automotive products.

Opportunity arose for Tucker from the Netherlands, whose government wanted a combat vehicle suited to the muddy Dutch terrain. Continuing his working relationship with Harry Miller, Tucker began designing the Tucker armored car, nicknamed the &quot;Tucker Tiger&quot;, a short-wheelbase armored car powered by a Miller-modified Packard V-12 engine.

At least one prototype of the combat car was built. Production of the car was to be done at the Rahway, New Jersey, factory owned by the American Armament Corporation. The Germans invaded the Netherlands in the spring of 1940 before Tucker could complete the deal, and the Dutch government-in-exile lost interest, so he completed the prototypes and opted to try to sell the vehicle to the United States Armed Forces. The car is said to have reached 100 mph (161 km/h), far in excess of the design specifications. The U.S. military rejected the Combat Car, as they felt the vehicle was too fast, and had already committed to other combat vehicles. However, the highly mobile, power-operated gun turret featured on the Combat Car, the &quot;Tucker Turret&quot;, earned the interest of the United States Navy. Harry Miller would later take some of the designs from the Tucker Combat Car to American Bantam, where he was involved in the development of the first Jeep.

The Tucker Turret was soon in production (initially at Tucker&#x27;s Ypsilanti machine shop). Though the turret is often reported to have been used widely on bombers, like the B-17 and B-29, it was actually developed for the Douglas B-18 Bolo. In the end, no Tucker turrets were equipped on any bombers.

Tucker&#x27;s patent and royalty rights were confiscated by the U.S. and Tucker was embroiled in lawsuits for years trying to recoup royalties for use of his patents on the turret.

==Tucker Aviation Corporation and Higgins-Tucker Aviation (1941–1943)==

In 1940, Tucker formed the Tucker Aviation Corporation, with the goal of manufacturing aircraft and marine engines. The corporation (Tucker&#x27;s first) was initially based at his shop behind his Michigan home. A public corporation with stock certificates issued, Tucker raised enough to develop the design for a fighter aircraft, the Tucker XP-57, which earned the interest of the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC). Development of a single prototype of the XP-57 was started, powered by a straight 8-cylinder engine developed and influenced by Harry Miller, called the Miller L-510. Nicknamed the &quot;Peashooter&quot;, this fighter competed for WWII government war contracts. However, financial problems within the company slowed the development of the prototype and the USAAC allowed the contract to lapse.

During World War II, Tucker became associated with Andrew Jackson Higgins of Higgins Industries, builder of Liberty ships, PT boats, and landing craft. Higgins acquired Tucker Aviation Corporation in March 1942, and Tucker moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, to serve as a vice-president of Higgins Industries, specifically in charge of the Higgins-Tucker Aviation division. This entity was to produce gun turrets, armament, and engines for Higgins&#x27; torpedo boats. However, this relationship did not work out and Tucker severed his association with Higgins in 1943. Go referred to Preston Tucker as &quot;The world&#x27;s greatest salesman. When he turns those big brown eyes on you, you&#x27;d better watch out!&quot;

After 1943, Tucker moved back to Michigan, intending to start his own auto company, the Tucker Corporation.

==Tucker Corporation and the 1948 Tucker Sedan (1944–1947)==


After the war, the public was ready for new car designs, but the Big Three automakers had not developed any new models since 1941, and were in no hurry to introduce them. That provided great opportunities for new small, independent automakers who could develop new cars more rapidly than the huge legacy automakers. Tucker saw his opportunity to develop and bring his &quot;car of tomorrow&quot; to market. Studebaker was first with an all-new postwar model, but Tucker took a different tack, designing a safety-oriented car with innovative features and modern styling.

Tucker&#x27;s first design appeared in &quot;Science Illustrated&quot; magazine in December 1946, showing a futuristic version of the car with a hydraulic drive system designed by George Lawson, along with a photo of a 1/8 scale model blown up to appear full sized, titled the &quot;Torpedo on Wheels&quot;. That was only an early rendering of the proposal, with its design features yet to meet reality, but the motoring public was now excited about the Tucker.

To finish the prototype design and get construction under way, Tucker hired famed stylist Alex Tremulis, previously of Auburn/Cord/Duesenberg, on December 24, 1946, and gave him just six days to finalize the design. On December 31, 1946, Tucker approved Tremulis&#x27;s preliminary design. Tucker&#x27;s future-car became known as the &quot;Tucker Torpedo&quot; from the first Lawson sketch; however, not desiring to bring to mind the horrors of WWII, Tucker quickly changed the name to the &quot;Tucker 48&quot;. With Tremulis&#x27;s design sketch, a full-page advertisement was run in March 1947 in many national newspapers claiming &quot;How 15 years of testing produced the car of the year&quot;. Tucker said he had been thinking about the car for 15 years. The second advertisement described specifically many of the innovative features Tucker proposed for his car, many of which would not make it to the final car. This advertisement had the public very excited about this car, but Tucker had much work to do before a prototype was ready to be shown.
To finalize the design, Tucker hired the New York design firm J. Gordon Lippincott to create an alternate body. Only the front end and horizontal taillight bar designs were retained for the final car. A sports car variant of the Tucker 48, the Tucker Talisman, was sketched as well but never left the drawing board.

To diversify his corporation, Tucker imported Italian engineer Secondo Campini, who was well known and respected in the aviation industry. He was put in charge of pursuing a United States Air Force development contract, hoping to use Tucker&#x27;s huge Chicago factory to someday build more than just cars. Campini and Tucker also began developing plans for a gas turbine-powered car to be produced by Tucker.

The Tucker Export Corporation was also formed, based in New York, which was established as an entity to manage worldwide sales of Tucker&#x27;s cars. Headed by Tucker&#x27;s long-time friend, Colombian Max Garavito, distributorships were set up internationally, including South America and South Africa.

Tucker assembled a group of automotive industry leaders for Tucker Corporation, including:
:Fred Rockelman; Tucker VP and Sales Director (Formerly president of Plymouth)
:Hanson Brown; Executive VP (Formerly VP for General Motors)
:KE Lyman; Development engineer (Formerly of Bendix Corporation and Borg-Warner)
:Ben Parsons; Tucker engineering VP and chief engineer (International fuel injection expert)
:Lee S. Treese; VP of manufacturing (Formerly a Ford executive)
:Herbert Morley; (Borg-Warner plant manager)
:Robert Pierce; VP and Treasurer (Formerly secretary of Briggs Manufacturing Company)
Tucker and his colleagues were able to obtain the largest factory building in the world, the Dodge Chicago Aircraft Engine Plant, which was later known as the Chicago Dodge Plant, from the War Assets Administration. The facility had previously been used to build the massive Wright R-3350 Cyclone engines for B-29 Superfortress aircraft during WWII. Tucker, thinking long-term, believed this large facility would fit his long-term goal of producing an entire line of Tucker automobiles under one roof.

Tucker signed the lease in July 1946, contingent on him raising $15 million in capital by March 1947. Tucker needed this money to get going, so he began raising money by selling dealership rights and floating a $20 million stock issue through the Chicago brokerage firm Floyd D. Cerf. With over $17 million in the bank by 1947, the Tucker Corporation was up and running.

While Tucker ultimately got the plant, he was not able to move in until September 1947 because of delays caused by counter-claims and disputes over the plant between Tucker and the Lustron Corporation. That delayed Tucker by almost a year, during which time development of the car continued at his Michigan machine shop. Tucker planned for 60,000 cars a year, with 140 per day produced for the first 4 months and 300 per day produced afterward.

Tucker suffered another setback when his bids to obtain two steel mills to provide raw materials for his cars were rejected by the WAA under a shroud of questionable politics.

Tucker&#x27;s specifications for his revolutionary car called for a rear engine, a low-RPM engine with hydraulic valves instead of a camshaft, fuel injection, direct-drive torque converters on each rear wheel (instead of a transmission), disc brakes, the location of all instruments within the diameter and reach of the steering wheel, a padded dashboard, self-sealing tubeless tires, independent springless suspension, a chassis that protected occupants in a side impact, a roll bar within the roof, a laminated windshield designed to pop out during an accident, and a center &quot;cyclops&quot; headlight which would turn when steering at angles greater than 10 degrees in order to improve visibility around corners during night driving.

While most of those innovations made it to the final 51 prototypes, several were dropped for their cost and the lack of time to develop such mechanically-complicated designs. The low-RPM 589-cubic-inch engine, individual torque converters, mechanical fuel injection, and the disc brakes were all dropped during the design and testing phase.

Having run out of time to develop the 589-cubic-inch engine for the car, Tucker ultimately settled on a modified Franklin O-335 aircraft engine. He liked the engine so much he purchased its manufacturer, Aircooled Motors in New York, for $1.8 million in 1947, securing a guaranteed engine supply for his car.

==Turmoil surrounding Tucker Corporation (1946–1948)==

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission bothered the Tucker Corporation from its earliest days. The SEC was embittered after small automaker Kaiser-Frazer was given millions of dollars in grants towards development of a new car, and subsequently squandered the money. While Tucker took no money from the federal government, small upstart automakers were under intense SEC scrutiny, and Tucker was no exception.

One of Tucker&#x27;s most innovative business ideas caused the most trouble for the company and was used by the SEC to spark its formal investigation. His Accessories Program raised funds by selling accessories before the car was even in production. Potential buyers who purchased Tucker accessories were guaranteed a spot on the dealer waiting list for a Tucker &#x27;48 car. Tucker also began selling dealerships before the car was ready for production, and at the time of the trial had sold over 2,000 dealerships nationwide at a price of $7,500 to nearly $30,000 each.

Feeling pressure from the SEC, Harry Aubrey Toulmin Jr., the chairman of the Tucker board of directors, resigned and wrote a letter to the SEC on September 26, 1947, in an attempt to distance himself from the company. In the letter, Toulmin indicated that he quit &quot;because of the manner in which Preston Tucker is using the funds obtained from the public through sale of stock.&quot; Describing Tucker as &quot;a tall, dark, delightful, but inexperienced boy&quot;, Toulmin added that the Tucker 48 &quot;does not actually run, it just goes &#x27;goose-geese&#x27;&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t know if it can back up.&quot; In reply, Tucker claimed that he had asked Toulmin to resign &quot;to make way for a prominent man now active in the automobile industry&quot;—himself.

In late 1947, a radio segment on Tucker by popular journalist Drew Pearson criticized the Tucker 48, calling it the &quot;tin goose&quot; (referring to Howard Hughes&#x27; Hughes H-4 Hercules, nicknamed the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;) and noting that the first prototype &quot;could not even back up&quot;. The first prototype lacked a reverse gear because Tucker had not had time to finish the direct torque drive by the time of the car&#x27;s unveiling. This was corrected in the final driveline, but the public damage was done and a negative media feeding frenzy resulted. Tucker responded by publishing a full-page advertisement in many national newspapers with &quot;an open letter to the automobile industry&quot; wherein he subtly hinted that his efforts to build the cars were being stymied by politics and an SEC conspiracy. Nonetheless, dealership owners began filing lawsuits to recover their money, and Tucker&#x27;s stock value plummeted.

==SEC trial and demise of the Tucker Corporation (1949–1950)==
In 1949, Tucker surrendered his corporate records to the SEC. United States Attorney Otto Kerner Jr. began a grand jury investigation in February 1949. On March 3, a federal judge handed control of the Tucker Corporation over to Aaron J. Colnon and John H. Schatz. Soon thereafter on June 10, Tucker and six other Tucker Corporation executives were indicted on 25 counts of mail fraud, five counts of violations of SEC regulations, and one count of conspiracy to defraud. The indictment included Tucker, 46; Harold A. Karsten, 58, &quot;alias Abe Karatz&quot;; Floyd D. Cerf, 61 (whose firm had handled the stock offering); Robert Pierce, 63; Fred Rockelman, 64; Mitchell W. Dulian, 50, Tucker sales manager; Otis Radford, 42, Tucker Corporation comptroller; and Cliff Knoble, 42, Tucker advertising manager.

Tucker publicly called the charges &quot;silly and ridiculous&quot; and hailed the indictment as &quot;an opportunity to explain our side of the story&quot;. Tucker and his colleagues&#x27; defense was handled by a team of attorneys led by William T. Kirby.

Another publication, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, ran an article critical of Tucker on June 25, 1949, which included leaked details of the SEC report (which was never released publicly). This article was reprinted in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; as well, expanding the scope of the negative press concerning Preston Tucker.

The trial began on October 4, 1949, presided over by Judge Walter J. LaBuy. Tucker Corporation&#x27;s factory was closed on the very same day. At that point, only 37 Tucker 48s had been built. A corps of 300 loyal employees returned to the factory (some without pay) and finished assembly of another 13 cars for a total production of 50 cars (not including the prototype).

At trial, the government contended that Tucker never intended to produce a car. Throughout the trial, the SEC report on Tucker was classified as &quot;secret&quot; and Tucker&#x27;s attorneys were never allowed to view or read it, but it was leaked to the press nevertheless.

As the trial proceeded, the government and SEC brought several witnesses (mostly former Tucker employees) to highlight the rudimentary methods used by Tucker to develop the car; the early suspensions were installed three times before they worked, and early parts were taken from junkyards to build the prototype. Answering back in Tucker&#x27;s defense, designer Alex Tremulis testified that it was common industry practice to use old car parts for prototype builds, and pointed out this had been done when he was involved with developing the 1942 Oldsmobile under General Motors.

Tucker Vice President Lee Treese testified that Tucker&#x27;s metal stamping and parts fabrication operations were 90% ready to mass-produce the car by June 1948 and that outside interference had slowed the final preparations for production. This back and forth between the prosecution and the defense continued until November 8, 1949, when the judge demanded the SEC prosecutors &quot;get down to the meat of the case and start proving the conspiracy charge.&quot;

Defense attorney Kirby directed attention to automaker Kaiser-Frazer, pointing out that early models of their government-funded new car model had been made of wood and that when this project failed, Kirby stated in court documents that &quot;Kaiser-Frazer didn&#x27;t get indicted, and they got 44 million dollars in loans from the government, didn&#x27;t they?&quot; All told Kaiser-Frazer had received nearly $200 million in government grants, but did not produce the car they promised.

After a break for Christmas, the trial resumed in January 1950. The government&#x27;s star witness, Daniel J. Ehlenz, a former Tucker dealership owner and distributor from St. Paul, Minnesota, testified that he had lost $28,000 in his investment in the Tucker Corporation. However, on cross-examination, the defense used this witness to their advantage when Ehlenz testified that he still drove his Tucker 48 given to him by Tucker, and that the car had on it and still cruised smoothly at .

The tide turned in Tucker&#x27;s favor when the government called its final witness, SEC accountant Joseph Turnbull, who testified that Tucker had taken in over $28 million and spent less than one-seventh of it on research and development of the car. He stated that Tucker had taken over $500,000 of the investors&#x27; money for himself, but never delivered a production car. Kirby rebutted Turnbull&#x27;s claims on cross-examination, asking for proof of the allegations of financial mismanagement from Tucker&#x27;s seized financial records. Turnbull was unable to offer such evidence. In closing his witness testimony, Kirby asked Turnbull, &quot;You are not here suggesting these figures are figures of monies taken fraudulently, are you?&quot; Turnbull&#x27;s answer was, &quot;Not exactly, no.&quot;

After this final SEC witness, Tucker&#x27;s defense attorneys surprised everyone by refusing to call any witnesses to the stand. Defense attorney Daniel Glasser told the court, &quot;It is impossible to present a defense when there has been no offense&quot;. In his closing arguments, Kirby became tearful and emotionally told the jury to &quot;stop picking at the turkey&quot;, and stated that Tucker &quot;either intended to cheat and that&#x27;s all they intended to do or they tried in good faith to produce a car. The two are irreconcilable.&quot; He then invited the members of the jury to take a ride in one of the eight Tucker 48s parked in front of the courthouse before they made their decision.

On January 22, 1950, after 28 hours of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot; on all counts for all accused. Tucker had prevailed at the trial, but the Tucker Corporation, now without a factory, buried in debt, and faced with numerous lawsuits from Tucker dealers that were angry about the production delays, was effectively no more.

==Speculation and controversy surrounding the Tucker Corporation==
Despite the outcome of the trial, speculation has continued with regard to the question of whether Tucker genuinely intended to produce a new car and bring it to market, or whether the entire enterprise was a sham, designed for the sole purpose of collecting funds from gullible investors. Tucker collectors of the Tucker Automobile Club of America have amassed over 400,000 drawings, blueprints, corporate documents, and letters which they believe suggest that Tucker was, in fact, developing the manufacturing process necessary to mass-produce the Tucker 48. They also point to the fact that by the time of the investigation, Tucker had hired over 1,900 employees, including teams of engineers and machinists. At the trial, the Tucker VP Lee Treese testified that they were 90% ready with industrial machinery at the Chicago plant to mass-produce the vehicle.

==Later life and death (1950–1956)==

Preston Tucker&#x27;s reputation rebounded after the acquittal. His optimism was remarkable; after the trial was over, he was quoted as saying, &quot;Even Henry Ford failed the first time out.&quot; Tucker Corporation assets were auctioned off publicly in Chicago. One remaining Tucker 48 car was given to Preston Tucker, and another to his mother.
In the early 1950s, Tucker teamed up with investors from Brazil and auto designer Alexis de Sakhnoffsky to build a sports car called the Carioca. Tucker could not use the Tucker name for the car, as Peter Dun of Dun &amp; Bradstreet had purchased the rights to the name, and the Tucker Carioca was ultimately never developed.

Tucker&#x27;s travels to Brazil were plagued by fatigue, and upon his return to the United States, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Tucker died from pneumonia as a complication of lung cancer on December 26, 1956, at the age of 53. Tucker is buried at Michigan Memorial Park in Flat Rock, Michigan.

==Legacy==

In 1954, a group of investors tried to revive the Tucker Corporation by soliciting investors, mostly former Tucker distributors and dealer owners, for a new car. This effort was led by George A. Schmidt, former president of the Tucker Dealers Association. They developed sketches for a sleek 2-door convertible, but were unable to generate enough support to get it off the drawing board.

Tucker&#x27;s defense attorney, William T. Kirby, later became Chairman of the Board of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

Otto Kerner Jr., the U.S. Attorney who had aggressively pursued the Tucker Corporation, was later convicted on 17 counts of bribery, conspiracy, perjury, and related charges for stock fraud in 1974. He was the first federal appellate judge in U.S. history to be jailed. Kerner was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $50,000.

The location of the former Tucker Corporation, 7401 S. Cicero Avenue in Chicago, became the corporate headquarters of Tootsie Roll Industries and the Ford City Mall (the building was owned for a time by Ford Motor Company). The building was so large that it was divided in two, with a large open area between the two resulting buildings.

Tucker&#x27;s design concepts for the Tucker 48 included revolutionary ideas in car safety that helped formulate car safety standards. The Tucker family held on to Aircooled Motors until 1961, when it was sold to Aero Industries.

The remaining Tucker 48 cars are highly collectible, and examples in very good condition have commanded prices of up to $3 million each. Original stock certificates for Tucker Corporation common stock are valuable to collectors, and are worth more than when originally issued. Over 10,000 such stock certificates were personally signed by Preston Tucker, making these the most desirable.

<text>Syldavia (Syldavian: ) is a fictional country in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. It is located in the Balkans and has a rivalry with the fictional neighbouring country of Borduria. Syldavia is depicted in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; (1938–1939), &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (1950), &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; (1952–1953, briefly), &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; (1954–1956), and &quot;Tintin and the Lake of Sharks&quot; (1972), and is mentioned in &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot; (1975–1976).

According to Harry Thompson&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Tintin: Hergé and Its Creation&quot;, Syldavia &quot;was an idealised portrayal of central Europe between the wars – a benevolent monarchy, peaceful village life, sturdy peasants puffing on large pipes.&quot;

Hergé claimed that the country is heavily inspired by the real-world countries of both Albania and Montenegro, and may also be based on larger Balkan nations such as Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.

==Overview==
Syldavia is a monarchy, ruled at the time of &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; by King Muskar XII. The capital is Klow, formerly Zileheroum, located at the confluence of the Moltus and Vladir Rivers (after Prague, which is on the Vltava River). Other cities named in the books are Niedzdrow, Istov, Dbrnouk, Douma, Tesznik, and Zlip. The population of Syldavia is 642,000 with 122,000 living in Klow, suggesting the country is similar in size to Montenegro. The national airline is Syldair and the official currency is the khôr. One khôr is subdivided into 100 paroe.

The people speak Syldavian, a language that looks and sounds Slavic but is mostly based on the West Germanic Marols dialect from Brussels. It is written in Cyrillic, but curiously, the Latin alphabet is used in medieval documents, and some of the Cyrillic letters used are a straight transcription from the Latin letters (e.g., &quot;sh&quot; is written &quot;сз&quot; -compare to Polish &quot;sz&quot;- rather than &quot;ш&quot;).

The kingdom&#x27;s motto is &quot; which Hergé translates as &quot; &quot;Who rubs himself there gets stung&quot; (in fact, the motto of Nancy, from the Latin , referring to its emblem, the thistle; in the British edition, the translators rendered the motto &quot;If you gather Thistles, expect Prickles&quot;). The motto can also be interpreted as a Brussels dialect rendering of the Dutch phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;Here I am, here I stay&quot;).

Syldavians seem to be fond of mineral water, which does not go down well with the whisky-drinking Captain Haddock, one of Tintin&#x27;s travelling companions.

The exact location of Syldavia is not given in the comics, and nothing more is known than that it is located on the Balkan peninsula, bordering another fictional country Borduria, and that it has access to the sea. It is also mistaken for Greece in one instance, but explained as having very different local clothing. In &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, the trail of the Syldavian-launched rocket points to a location north of the Danube. There are various inspirations for Syldavia. As Hergé noted, the primary inspiration was Montenegro, but the country&#x27;s history is modeled after many Balkan countries. Har Brok writes that Syldavia &quot;may have been modelled after a country like Romania or Yugoslavia&quot;.

Syldavia is also known for exporting violinists.

==History==
The region of Syldavia was inhabited by nomadic tribes of unknown origin until the 6th century, when it was overrun by Slavs. It was conquered in the 10th century by the Turks, who occupied the plains forcing the Slavs into the mountains (in reality, the Balkans were conquered in the 14th century). The modern Syldavia was formed in 1127 when a tribal chief called Hveghi defeated the Turkish conquerors at the battle of Zileheroum and took the name Muskar, ruling until 1168. Although he was a successful ruler, his son Muskar II was an inferior king as ruler. Borduria conquered the country during the reign of Muskar II in 1195 until Ottokar I (his real name and title being Baron Almaszout) drove them away in 1275.

King Ottokar IV became King in 1360. He took away the power of many upstart nobles. When an enemy, Baron Staszrvitch, claimed the Throne and attacked him with his sword, Ottokar struck him to the ground with his sceptre. The King then said the motto and decreed that the ruler of Syldavia must have hold on the sceptre, otherwise he would lose his authority, as it had saved his life. This custom had the power of law as late as 1939.

In 1939 Syldavia was nearly invaded by its neighbor Borduria, part of a plot to oust King Muskar XII. The sceptre was stolen in the hope that the king would abdicate. Tintin had a hand in defusing the situation by returning the sceptre just before St Vladmir&#x27;s day. The Bordurians then announced they were withdrawing troops 15 miles from the borders. (The situation was very similar to that of Anschluss in Austria in 1938 though the conclusion was not the same.)

King Muskar XII is a keen motorist who drives himself with only an aide for escort and carries his own pistol for protection. He appears in elaborate hussar dress for court and public ceremonies and in a plainer uniform on other occasions. Muskar XII is an actual ruler rather than a constitutional monarch (see enlightened absolutism). He himself ordered his ministers and generals to make the moves necessary to prevent the coup and the invasion. King Muskar XII is married, but his queen&#x27;s name is not known.

The king is notably absent from the other stories set in or involving Syldavia – &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; and &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;. Both were set after World War II, at a time when the various Balkan monarchies providing models for the fictional Syldavia had been overthrown and their rulers exiled. It is not clear what form of government is in power in the post-war Syldavia.

==National symbols==

The Syldavian achievement of arms is shown on the title page and page 62 of the &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; album. It would be blazoned heraldically as follows:

&quot;Quarterly, first and fourth Or a pelican displayed sable, second and third gules two increscents in fess argent; for a crest, on a barred helmet affronty or, mantled azure doubled Or, the Royal Crown of Syldavia proper; behind the shield the Royal Sceptre of Syldavia and a sceptre of justice in saltire; the motto &quot;Eih bennek, eih blavek&quot; on a scroll below the shield, pendent therefrom the badge of the Order of the Golden Pelican.&quot;

The flag of Syldavia is seen on page 59 of King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre, as the King&#x27;s procession passes onlooking crowds. It appears to be identical to first and fourth quarter of the coat of arms, that being &quot;Or a pelican displayed sable&quot;. The flag is seen earlier, flying on a toy castle, on page 44. A potential maritime ensign is seen on page 61, as Tintin and the detectives are piloted on a boat to a seaplane, on the back of it having a white flag with the words &quot;SYLDAVIA&quot; written in black.

==Language==

In their book (Casterman, 2004 ), Daniel Justens and Alain Préaux have documented how the Syldavian language is based on &quot;Marols&quot; or &quot;Marollien&quot;, the dialect of the Marollen, a formerly working-class (though now trendy) quarter of Brussels. Marols, which Hergé learnt from his grandmother, is a form of Dutch incorporating many words of French origin as well as a sprinkling of Spanish. Syldavian seems to incorporate features of various Central European languages into the Marols foundation to suit Hergé&#x27;s taste, such as German, Polish, Czech, and Hungarian. It is written both in Cyrillic and in Latin script, like Serbian.

Educated Syldavians are shown speaking Tintin&#x27;s language (French in the original). There is a hint that German is the predominant second language among the less educated, as in one scene when Haddock complains he is thirsty, a Syldavian soldier does not understand him until he yells &quot;&quot;. At that time, German was the dominant lingua franca in Central and Eastern Europe, and Syldavians would be expected to have a better command of German than most other Central or Eastern Europeans, as their language is related to German.

Within the universe, the existence of the Germanic Syldavian language (and most likely Bordurian as well) may be explained as having been brought by the in-migration of German-speakers, such as the real-life Transylvanian Saxons and Danube Swabians, perhaps as part of the larger Ostsiedlung, but whose language diverged over a thousand years due to relative isolation from the rest of the Germanic-speaking world and contact with other groups, which is in fact not unlike how Romanian developed.

==Cuisine==
Syldavian cuisine appears to be typical of Eastern Europe; blini, herbs, sausage and garnish are seen in the kitchen of a Syldavian restaurant in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;. Mineral water is an important export, and alcohol is scarce, much to Captain Haddock&#x27;s disgust. When Haddock tries to bring in alcohol with him when visiting Calculus at the research facility, he is hit with high alcohol duty.
It is mentioned that a prime dish in the country is szlaszeck, described by a waiter as the hind leg of a young dog in a heavy Syldavian sauce. However, this may not be true as the waiter was deliberately attempting to disturb Tintin. Szlaszeck (apparently from Polish &quot;szaszłyk&quot;, &quot;shish kebab&quot;) is served to Tintin with mushrooms and a salad.

== Atomic research ==
In the 1950s Syldavia had a secret but successful space program in the area of Sbrodj (named Sprodj in the English edition).

The Sprodj Atomic Research Centre, seen in &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;, is located in Syldavia. The sprawling complex is located in the Zymylpathian Mountains of Syldavia (a play on the Carpathian Mountains), located close to rich deposits of uranium. The Centre is secretive and has very tightly-guarded security, including a large number of security checkpoints, helicopter surveillance, anti-aircraft artillery, and a squadron of fighter aircraft based at the facility. Work at the centre, carried out by a large team of international physicists recruited by the Syldavian government, involves research into protection from the effects of nuclear weapons and is the base for the Syldavian space program. The facility, which seems to be entirely self-sufficient, is administered by the Director, Mr. Baxter. The Sprodj Centre has its own atomic pile for processing uranium into plutonium and has vast facilities for the research and construction of the rocket-ship which carries Tintin and his colleagues to the Moon. The gargantuan complex is last seen at the end of &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot; and is never again seen in the Tintin series.

In &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, the Sprodj Atomic Research Centre invites Professor Calculus to head its space division, and later Tintin and Captain Haddock to be part of the Moon mission. In &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, Syldavia&#x27;s secret agents compete with archrival Bordurian agents to kidnap Professor Calculus and obtain the secrets to develop sound-based weapons.

== National dance ==
The Blushtika, meaning &quot;Goat Dance Twisting&quot;, as seen in &quot;Tintin and the Lake of Sharks&quot;.

== National lake ==
The national lake is &quot;Pollishoff&quot;, meaning &quot;Lake of Sharks&quot;. The inspiration for this lake seems to be various lakes in the southern Balkans, particularly the Ohrid, Skadar or Prespa.

== National defence and ceremonial military units ==
By 1930s standards Syldavia has a modern military, equipped with anti-aircraft guns and radar stations. It appears to have well prepared defensive systems with checkpoints and bunkers.

The army has an Eastern European appearance, possibly modeled on that of Poland or Czechoslovakia. The helmets used resemble those of Switzerland however. The uniforms have standing collars and rank indications are worn on the collar. The green-uniformed armed police or gendarmerie are stationed in both rural and urban areas.

The Royal Guard wear hussar uniforms, a style which originated in Eastern Europe. The ceremonial guards at the Royal Treasure House, Klow have elaborate costumes of traditional Balkan design and are armed with halberds.

== Capital ==
The capital of Syldavia is Klow. The city was founded in the 10th century by the invading Turks and was then named Zileheroum. The Magyar nomads that lived there were forced to live in the Zmyhlpathernian mountains, while the Turks themselves settled in the newly founded city located in the lush hills. In the year 1127, the nomads, led by their chief Hveghi, defeated and drove away the Turkish conquerors. Hveghi took the name Muskar, meaning &quot;the brave&quot; and Zileheroum was renamed to Klow, meaning &quot;freetown&quot; from &quot;kloho&quot; (&quot;freedom&quot;) and &quot;ow&quot; (&quot;town&quot;). In 1168, Muskar died and was succeeded by his son Muskar II. Muskar II, however, was weak, and the neighboring Bordurians took over the country.

Klow has a wide variety of cultural styles. Mostly typical Yugoslavian, there are also many buildings of Austrian and Turkish appearance, for example, the old mosques. However, the Kropow castle&#x27;s architecture and decoration are of Bohemian pattern, but this could be because of the fame of Czech architecture.

As a large and relatively well-off capital city, Klow has a large museum of natural science with mounted dinosaur skeletons. Klow is said to be the Capital of Mineral Water, and they are famous for their Klowaswa (Cyrillic: Кловасва), their national mineral water, literally meaning &quot;Klow Water&quot; or &quot;Water from Klow&quot;. In contrast to ordinary Syldavians, who use Cyrillic, the Royal Court in Klow uses the Latin alphabet.

==In popular culture==
The song &quot;Sildavia&quot; from the Spanish group &quot;La Unión&quot; (&quot;Mil Siluetas&quot;, 1984) mentions this country as a land of dreams. The Dutch group Flairck also has a song called &quot;Syldavian Waltz&quot;, featured in their album &quot;The Emigrant&quot; (&quot;Syldavische wals&quot;, &quot;De Emigrant&quot;, 1989).

<text>In Greek mythology and ancient Greek religion, Mnemosyne (; , ) is the goddess of memory and the mother of the nine Muses by her nephew Zeus. In the Greek tradition, Mnemosyne is one of the Titans, the twelve divine children of the earth-goddess Gaia and the sky-god Uranus. The term &quot;Mnemosyne&quot; is derived from the same source as the word &quot;mnemonic&quot;, that being the Greek word &quot;mnēmē&quot;, which means &quot;remembrance, memory&quot;.

== Family ==
A Titaness, Mnemosyne is the daughter of Uranus and Gaia. Mnemosyne became the mother of the nine Muses, fathered by her nephew, Zeus:

* Calliope (epic poetry)
* Clio (history)
* Euterpe (music and lyric poetry)
* Erato (love poetry)
* Melpomene (tragedy)
* Polyhymnia (hymns)
* Terpsichore (dance)
* Thalia (comedy)
* Urania (astronomy)

Hyginus in his &quot;Fabulae&quot; gives Mnemosyne a different parentage, where she was the daughter of Zeus and Clymene.

== Mythology ==
In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, kings and poets receive their powers of authoritative speech from their possession of Mnemosyne and their special relationship with the Muses.
Zeus, in the form of a mortal shepherd, slept together with Mnemosyne for nine consecutive nights, thus conceiving the nine Muses. Mnemosyne also presided over a pool in Hades, a counterpart to the river Lethe, according to a series of 4th-century BC Greek funerary inscriptions in dactylic hexameter. Dead souls drank from Lethe so they would not remember their past lives when reincarnated. In Orphism, the initiated were taught to instead drink from the Mnemosyne, the river of memory, which would stop the transmigration of the soul.

=== Appearance in oral literature ===
Although she was categorized as one of the Titans in the &quot;Theogony&quot;, Mnemosyne did not quite fit that distinction. Titans were hardly worshiped in Ancient Greece, and were thought of as so archaic as to belong to the ancient past. They resembled historical figures more than anything else. Mnemosyne, on the other hand, traditionally appeared in the first few lines of many oral epic poems—she appears in both the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, among others—as the speaker called upon her aid in accurately remembering and performing the poem they were about to recite. Mnemosyne is thought to have been given the distinction of &quot;Titan&quot; because memory was so important and basic to the oral culture of the Greeks that they deemed her one of the essential building blocks of civilization in their creation myth.

Later, once written literature overtook the oral recitation of epics, Plato made reference in his &quot;Euthydemus&quot; to the older tradition of invoking Mnemosyne. The character Socrates prepares to recount a story and says &quot;ὥστ᾽ ἔγωγε, καθάπερ οἱ (275d) ποιηταί, δέομαι ἀρχόμενος τῆς διηγήσεως Μούσας τε καὶ Μνημοσύνην ἐπικαλεῖσθαι.&quot; which translates to &quot;Consequently, like the poets, I must needs begin my narrative with an invocation of the Muses and Memory&quot; (emphasis added). Aristophanes also harked back to the tradition in his play &quot;Lysistrata&quot; when a drunken Spartan ambassador invokes her name while prancing around pretending to be a bard from times of yore.

== Cult ==
While not one of the most popular divinities, Mnemosyne was the subject of some minor worship in Ancient Greece. Statues of her are mentioned in the sanctuaries of other gods, and she was often depicted alongside her daughters the Muses. She was also worshipped in Lebadeia in Boeotia, at Mount Helicon in Boeotia, and in the cult of Asclepius.

There was a statue of Mnemosyne in the shrine of Dionysos at Athens, alongside the statues of the Muses, Zeus and Apollo, as well as a statue with her daughters the Muses in the Temple of Athena Alea. Pausanias described the worship of Mnemosyne in Lebadeia in Boeotia, where she played an important part in the oracular sanctuary of Trophonios: 

Mnemosyne was also sometime regarded as being not the mother of the Muses but as one of them, and as such she was worshiped in the sanctuary of the Muses at Mount Helicon in Boeotia: 
=== Cult of Asclepius ===
Mnemosyne was one of the deities worshiped in the cult of Asclepius that formed in Ancient Greece around the 5th century BC. Asclepius, a Greek hero and god of medicine, was said to have been able to cure maladies, and the cult incorporated a multitude of other Greek heroes and gods in its process of healing. The exact order of the offerings and prayers varied by location, and the supplicant often made an offering to Mnemosyne. After making an offering to Asclepius himself, in some locations, one last prayer was said to Mnemosyne as the supplicant moved to the holiest portion of the Asclepeion to incubate. The hope was that a prayer to Mnemosyne would help the supplicant remember any visions had while sleeping there.

<doc id="54563" wikidata="Q617822" url="?curid=54563" title="Jars of Clay">
<text>Jars of Clay is a Christian alternative rock band from Nashville, Tennessee. The members met at Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois. They consist of Dan Haseltine on vocals, Charlie Lowell on piano and keyboards, Stephen Mason on lead guitars and Matthew Odmark on rhythm guitars. Although the band has no permanent drummer or bass guitarist, Jeremy Lutito and Gabe Ruschival of Disappointed by Candy fill these roles for live concerts. Past tour band members include Aaron Sands, Scott Savage, and Joe Porter. Jars of Clay&#x27;s style is a blend of alternative rock, folk, acoustic, and R&amp;B.

The band&#x27;s name is derived from the New International Version&#x27;s translation of 2 Corinthians 4:7:

This verse is paraphrased in their song &quot;Four Seven&quot;, which appears as a hidden track on the CD release of their self-titled album.

== Band history ==
Charlie Lowell and Matt Bronleewe originally met as friends in high school. There, Lowell first learned of 2 Corinthians 4:7, which later became the basis for the band&#x27;s name. Dan Haseltine, Steve Mason, Charlie Lowell and Matt Bronleewe formed Jars of Clay at Greenville College, in Greenville, Illinois in the early 1990s. Charlie Lowell first met Dan Haseltine after noticing that he was wearing a Toad the Wet Sprocket shirt. Pursuing a career in music together was not necessarily their original goal; some of the first songs they wrote together were for music and recording classes they were taking at the time. Their second guitarist Matt Odmark joined some time later. While in college playing together at local coffee houses, Jars gained a reputation for their original arrangement of &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer&quot; which had been adapted to the tune of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.

In 1994, the band submitted a demo to a talent competition run by the Gospel Music Association and were selected as finalists. They traveled to Nashville to perform and won the contest. Back in Greenville, they self-released a limited-run of the same demo, &quot;Frail&quot;, after their song of the same name. The buzz from their performance in Nashville and the demo&#x27;s popularity resulted in offers from record labels, so the band decided to drop school and move to Nashville. At this time, Bronleewe left the band to finish school and settle down with his fiancée. He was replaced with Matt Odmark, Lowell&#x27;s childhood friend and fellow McQuaid Jesuit High School alum.

The band signed with Essential Records and started recording their first full-length studio album, &quot;Jars of Clay&quot;. Adrian Belew, of progressive rock band King Crimson, heard the band and offered to produce, leading to him producing two songs: &quot;Liquid&quot; and &quot;Flood&quot;. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut released in 1995. When the single &quot;Flood&quot; began to climb the charts on mainstream radio stations, Silvertone Records (Essential&#x27;s parent company) started to heavily promote the song, turning it into one of the biggest mainstream hits ever by a band on a Christian label. The album has since reached multi-platinum certification according to the RIAA. &quot;Flood&quot; peaked at No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart, and was the band&#x27;s only secular radio hit.

The band toured in support of other Christian acts, such as PFR, and with mainstream acts like Matchbox Twenty, Duncan Sheik, and Sting. This resulted in a small backlash from some Christian groups.

The band released &quot;Drummer Boy&quot;, a Christmas EP entitled, at the end of 1995. The EP was re-released, on Silvertone Records, in 1997 with a slightly different track listing. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Much Afraid&quot;, produced by Stephen Lipson was also released in 1997. The album sold well and like its predecessor, enjoyed crossover success. The album went on to earn a Grammy for &quot;Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album&quot;. The album has since earned platinum certification by the RIAA. They released two music videos for this album for the songs &quot;Crazy Times&quot; and &quot;Five Candles (You Were There)&quot;. 

In 1999, Jars of Clay released their third album, &quot;If I Left the Zoo&quot;, which was produced by Dennis Herring. The record was their third to crossover into the mainstream, and it earned the band their second Grammy award. It was during this time that touring drummer Scott Savage left the band&#x27;s touring group to play for Jaci Velasquez and was replaced by Joe Porter. Lead radio single, &quot;Unforgetful You&quot;, was also featured on the soundtrack to the motion picture &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;. &quot;Collide&quot; was also featured on the motion picture &quot;Hometown Legend&quot;. Upon the release of &quot;If I Left the Zoo&quot; they also released &quot;Front Yard Luge&quot; and after a year &quot;The White Elephant Sessions&quot;. &quot;If I Left the Zoo&quot; so far has the most singles released by Jars of Clay.

In 2001, the four members of the band received honorary degrees at Greenville College. Only three of them, Haseltine, Lowell, and Mason, had studied at the school before dropping out in 1994 to move to Nashville. Odmark still received an honorary degree, despite having attended the University of Rochester in upstate New York.

In 2002, the band self-produced and released their fourth album, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, which earned them a Grammy award for the third album in a row. The album relied on studio musicians and the band&#x27;s touring musicians to fill in for the band&#x27;s lack of drummer and bass player. Concerts from the subsequent &quot;Eleventh Hour Tour&quot; were recorded for later projects, including the release of a live concert DVD, 11Live: Jars of Clay in Concert.

The double-disc &quot;&quot; features an acoustic disc and a live disc. The acoustic disc consisted of reworked and rearranged fan favorites, two &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; b-sides, and a cover of Adam Again&#x27;s &quot;Dig&quot;. The latter was actually intended for a tribute album for Gene Eugene, who had died recently. The live disc features a recent concert recording that include songs from throughout the band&#x27;s career.

The band continued the acoustic and organic approach that was featured on &quot;Furthermore&quot; for their fifth studio album entitled &quot;Who We Are Instead&quot;, which released on November 4, 2003. On the album, the band revisited various styles they had used previously, as well as experimenting with new influences, such as gospel, hymns, and Nickel Creek&#x27;s &quot;newgrass&quot; style.

In early 2005, the band released &quot;Redemption Songs&quot;, a collection of hymns and traditional songs with new melodies and rearranged the music. &quot;God Will Lift Up Your Head&quot;, reworked as an acoustic rocker, was a hit for the band on Christian radio. They also covered five hymns from the &quot;Indelible Grace&quot; CD series (a series which originated from the work of Reformed University Fellowship).

Their next album, &quot;Good Monsters&quot;, was released on September 5, 2006 and was labeled by Jars of Clay &quot;their first ever rock record&quot;. In the September 2006 edition of &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;, the band credited fellow artist Ashley Cleveland with inspiring the improvisational sound of the album. The magazine called it &quot;the most profound album the Christian music community has released in years&quot;.

On September 4, 2007, two albums from the band were released simultaneously. The first was a mainstream release of &quot;Live Monsters&quot;, an EP of live concert recordings of songs, originally recorded for &quot;Good Monsters&quot; and that had been previously released through the iTunes Store and the official Jars of Clay online store. The second release, through Essential/Legacy, was a greatest hits album, &quot;The Essential Jars of Clay&quot;. On April 1, 2008, Essential Records released the band&#x27;s third greatest hits album, the second in that year, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. Included was the new song &quot;Love is the Protest&quot;.

In March 2007, the band announced at a concert in Des Moines, Iowa, that they were no longer on Essential Records and would now be releasing music independently. Later, press releases announced the name of their label as Gray Matters, which would be a partnership with Nettwerk Music Group. Along with the announcement of their new label, the band mentioned that they are planning to record the soundtrack to Honoring a Father&#x27;s Dream: Sons of Lwala, a documentary about Milton and Fred Ochieng&#x27; - brothers from the African village training to be doctors in the States, working to build a clinic in their home town. The band&#x27;s first release through Gray Matters was a full-length Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Songs&quot;, on October 16, 2007. On July 29, 2008, Gray Matters Records released &quot;Closer EP&quot; exclusively through online digital music stores. It was subsequently released on CD on August 19, 2008 and included reworked versions of &quot;Flood&quot;, called &quot;Flood (New Rain)&quot;, and &quot;Love Song For a Savior (&#x27;08)&quot; from their debut album. 

The band&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;The Long Fall Back to Earth&quot;, was released on April 21, 2009. and contained 14 songs, including &quot;Closer&quot; and &quot;Safe to Land&quot;, from the &quot;Closer EP&quot;, and is influenced by 80s music, specifically Tears for Fears and The Cure. &quot;The Long Fall Back to Earth&quot; debuted at No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 mainstream charts, which was Jars of Clay&#x27;s highest debut since &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; which debuted at No. 28 in 2002. The second single off the album is &quot;Heaven&quot;. The song &quot;Hero&quot; was featured on a trailer for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Kings&quot;. &quot;The Long Fall Back to Earth&quot; was nominated for the Grammy to the &quot;Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album&quot;, though they didn&#x27;t win in the category.

&quot;The Shelter&quot; was released October 5, 2010 and features eleven tracks. During their promotion for the album, the band streamed the entire album for a few days before its release on their website. In early 2011 they toured the United States on the Rock And Worship Roadshow headlined by MercyMe. In July 2012, the band traveled to Portland, Oregon, to begin recording &quot;Inland&quot; at Flora Recording &amp; Playback, a music studio owned and operated by Tucker Martine. The new album was released on August 27, 2013 and features twelve tracks. On March 18, 2013, the band released an exclusive track, &quot;Love in Hard Times&quot;, that could only be acquired with the purchase of their EP &quot;Under the Weather (Live in Sellersville, PA)&quot; directly from their website. On June 17, 2013, the band released a free download of the song &quot;Inland&quot; through &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s website. The first single off of the album, &quot;After the Fight&quot;, was released on June 18.

The group&#x27;s activities have been limited in recent years (as of 2022), each band member focusing on individual pursuits, but they continue to release music and perform sporadically. They collaborated with pop group SHEL, performing a Christmas concert in Nashville that led to a 6-song Christmas-themed EP titled &quot;A Family Christmas&quot;, which included four original songs. In 2022, they contributed a track to &quot;There&#x27;s a Rainbow Somewhere&quot;, a tribute album to Randy Stonehill.

== Blood: Water Mission ==

Lead singer Dan Haseltine visited Africa in 2002, which in turn inspired the founding of , a non-profit organization created to raise awareness and money for the poverty and AIDS stricken regions of the continent. The name is derived from, as Haseltine says, &quot;The two things Africa needs most&quot; - clean blood and clean water. The mission has begun the 1000 Wells project, an effort to have a thousand new wells built throughout Africa. In 2012, the organization met their goal of providing clean water to 1,000 African communities through the organization they founded, Blood: Water Mission, and its 1,000 Wells Project. Former Bassist for Jars of Clay Aaron Sands serves as Administrative Director for the project.

== Beliefs ==
In a 2002 interview with NPR&#x27;s Scott Simon on &quot;Weekend Edition Saturday&quot;, responding to a question about the relatively subtle religious content of their music, Haseltine said that the band&#x27;s songs are not meant to explain their faith but are written about their lives, which are affected by their faith. Haseltine explained the decision to &quot;shy away from ... traditional religious language&quot; as a conscious one, in part to make their music more accessible to those &quot;put off by religion&quot; and to &quot;love people in a way that isn&#x27;t exclusive to simply people that understand the language of Christianity&quot;. Haseltine also stated that art can &quot;make people feel what&#x27;s true rather than telling them&quot;.

<text>7 Up (stylized as 7UP worldwide) or Seven Up is an American brand of lemon-lime–flavored non-caffeinated soft drink. The brand and formula are owned by Keurig Dr Pepper, although the beverage is internationally distributed by PepsiCo except the UK where it is distributed by Britvic, PepsiCo&#x27;s designated UK distributor.

==History==

7 Up was created by Charles Leiper Grigg, who launched his St. Louis–based company The Howdy Corporation in 1920. Grigg came up with the formula for a lemon-lime soft drink in 1929, and the product was launched two weeks before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. An oft-repeated story is that the drink was originally called &quot;Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda,&quot; but some have argued that there is little to no evidence that a drink with this name actually existed. The drink did, however, claim to contain lithium citrate, a mood-stabilizing drug, initially. It was one of a number of patent medicine products popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries.

In fact, &quot;Bib-Label&quot; is not part of the name of the soda, but refers to the practice of hanging a piece of paper around the neck of a soda bottle like a bib. The trademark &quot;SEVEN-UP&quot; was granted in 1928, and a 1929 taste test advertisement featured a flying &quot;7up&quot; logo. The name became &quot;7up Lithiated Lemon Soda&quot; in 1930–1931, as indicated by the use of a logo with tilted &quot;up&quot; and historical paper labels. In 1936 the federal government forced the manufacturer to remove a number of health claims, and because &quot;lithium was not an actual ingredient&quot;, the name was changed to just &quot;7 Up&quot; in 1937. 

The origin of the name is unclear. Britvic claims that the name comes from the seven main ingredients in the drink, while others have claimed that the number was a reference to the lithium contained in the original recipe, which has an atomic mass of 7. Britvic also claims that the name alluded to 7 Up being packaged in seven-ounce bottles when Coca-Cola and most other soft drinks were bottled in six-ounce bottles.

The 7 Up company was privately owned by its founding families until it was sold in 1978 to Philip Morris, which sold it in 1986 in two parts: the international division to PepsiCo and the US business to a group led by the investment firm Hicks &amp; Haas. In the US, 7 Up merged with Dr Pepper in 1988 to form Dr Pepper/Seven Up; Cadbury Schweppes bought the combined company in 1995. The Dr Pepper Snapple Group was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008; it merged with Keurig Green Mountain in 2018 to form Keurig Dr Pepper.

==Consumption==
7 Up is commonly consumed cold refrigerated or with ice. It is also used as a mixer for highball alcoholic lemon-lime soda cocktails, including the 7 and 7 (Seagram&#x27;s 7 Crown and 7 Up) and CC and Seven (Canadian Club whisky and 7 Up). 7 Up is also used in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic punches.

==Formula==
7 Up has been reformulated several times since its launch in 1929. In 2006, the version of the product sold in the U.S. was reformulated so it could be marketed as being &quot;100% natural&quot;. This was achieved by eliminating the chelating agent calcium disodium EDTA, and replacing sodium citrate with potassium citrate to reduce the beverage&#x27;s sodium content. This reformulation contains no fruit juice and, in the U.S., is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The manufacturing process used in the production of HFCS has led some public health and advocacy groups to challenge the ad campaign&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; claims. 

In 2007, after the Center for Science in the Public Interest threatened to sue 7 Up, it was announced that 7 Up would stop being marketed as &quot;100% natural&quot;. Instead, it is now promoted as having &quot;100% Natural Flavors&quot;. The controversy does not extend to other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where HFCS is not generally used in foods, including 7 Up. In 2011, 7 Up began test marketing a formula, called 7 Up Retro, using sugar rather than HFCS. Container labels sport the caption &quot;Made With Real Sugar&quot;.

==Variants==


===Barbecue sauces and marinades===
In 2007, Cadbury Schweppes entered into a licensing partnership with Vita Food Products to produce a line of barbecue sauces and marinades flavored with Dr Pepper, 7 Up, and A&amp;W Root Beer.

==Advertising campaigns==

Metal pedestrian crossing markers saying &quot;Drink 7up Safety First&quot; were installed in many U.S. cities in the 1930s.

&quot;Fresh-Up Freddie&quot; was the rooster mascot for 7 Up in the 1950s. He gave viewers lessons about how to plan successful parties and picnics by having plenty of 7 Up on hand. The commercials were produced by Disney, giving the character the specific Disney look of the time. Freddie has been described as a hybrid of the rooster Panchito Pistoles from &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; and the zany Aracuan Bird from the same film. He often was dressed in human clothes. Freddie also appeared in the 1957 &quot;Zorro&quot; TV series&#x27; commercial intermissions. In these commercials, Freddie fought with Pete the Cat. Freddie, who was featured in a small amount of merchandising, was voiced by Paul Frees.

In the late 1960s and 1980s, Geoffrey Holder appeared in television ads as part of 7 Up&#x27;s &quot;Uncola&quot; ad campaign, designed to highlight differences between 7 Up and other soft drinks on the market with cola flavoring. In the ads, Geoffrey holds a pair of cola nuts in one hand and a lemon &amp; lime (used to flavor 7 Up) in the other hand and describes them as &quot;Uncola nuts&quot;.

In 1987, 7 Up introduced Spot, the red-orange dot in the 7 Up logo anthropomorphized into a mascot. The character was used heavily in advertising and licensed items across the U.S., including the 1993 platform video game &quot;Cool Spot&quot;, and its 1995 sequel, &quot;Spot Goes to Hollywood&quot;.

The cartoon character Fido Dido was used as a mascot in international areas from the late 1980s through the early 1990s, and was reintroduced in international markets in the early 2000s. Since PepsiCo did not own the rights to 7 Up in the US, certain ads featuring Fido Dido were instead reworked to advertise the company&#x27;s Slice brand of lemon-lime soda.

In the early 2000s, Orlando Jones served as the spokesperson for 7 Up in the United States in a series of commercials. Notably, one commercial had him wear a t-shirt that had 7 Up&#x27;s then-slogan &quot;Make 7 Up Yours&quot; divided between the front and back with the double entendre on the back that featured the &quot;Up Yours&quot; part; 7 Up would sell the shirt through specialty retailer Spencer Gifts for many years.

== Corporate sponsorship ==
In 1974, &quot;7 Up&quot; became The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&#x27;s first corporate sponsor; this was at a time when its sponsorship was generally limited to trade unions and civic organizations.

<text>Fiji is an Oceanian archipelago of volcanic islands with two main islands in the South Pacific, lying about north of New Zealand and southwest of Honolulu. Of the 332 islands and 522 smaller islets making up the archipelago, about 106 are permanently inhabited. The total land size is . It has the 26th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of .

Viti Levu, the largest island, covers about 57% of the nation&#x27;s land area, hosts the two official cities (the capital Suva, and Lautoka) and most other major towns, such as Nausori, Vaileka, Ba, Tavua, Kororvou, Nasinu, and Nadi (the site of the international airport), and contains some 69% of the population. Vanua Levu, to the northeast of Viti Levu, covers just over 30% of the land area though is home to only some 15% of the population. Its main towns are Labasa and Savusavu. In the northeast it features Natewa Bay, carving out the Loa peninsula.

Both islands are mountainous, with peaks up to rising abruptly from the shore, and covered with tropical forests. Heavy rains (up to annually) fall on the windward (southeastern) side, covering these sections of the islands with dense tropical forest. Lowlands on the western portions of each of the main islands are sheltered by the mountains and have a well-marked dry season favorable to crops such as sugarcane.

Other islands and island groups, which cover just 12.5% of the land area and house some 16% of the population, include Taveuni southeast off Vanua Levu and Kadavu Island, south off Viti Levu (the third and fourth largest islands respectively), the Mamanuca Group (just off Nadi) and Yasawa Group (to the north of the Mamanucas), which are popular tourist destinations, the Lomaiviti Group (just off Suva) with Levuka, the former capital and the only major town on any of the smaller islands, located on the island of Ovalau, and the remote Lau Group over the Koro Sea to the east near Tonga, from which it is separated by the Lakeba Passage.

Two outlying regions are Rotuma, to the north, and the uninhabited coral atoll and cay Ceva-i-Ra or Conway Reef, to the southwest of main Fiji. Culturally conservative Rotuma with its 2,000 people on geographically belongs to Polynesia, and enjoys relative autonomy as a Fijian dependency.

Fiji Television reported on 21 September 2006 that the Fiji Islands Maritime and Safety Administration (FIMSA), while reviewing its outdated maritime charts, had discovered the possibility that more islands could lie within Fiji&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone.

More than half of Fiji&#x27;s population lives on the island coasts, either in Suva or in smaller urban centers. The interior is sparsely populated because of its rough terrain.

== Climate ==

Fiji has a tropical rainforest climate and a tropical monsoon climate (Af and Am according to the Köppen climate classification). Suva, the capital city, receives more rainfall than Nadi or the other side of Viti Levu. El Niño and La Niña events have significant impacts on rainfall. Tropical cyclones can impact Fiji and in some cases they can cause severe damage and many deaths. In 2016, Cyclone Winston caused widespread destruction and affected hundreds of thousands of people after striking Fiji. A few years later, Cyclone Harold also caused widespread damage. 

Climate change in Fiji is an exceptionally pressing issue for the country – as an island nation, Fiji is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels, coastal erosion and extreme weather. These changes, along with temperature rise, will displace Fijian communities and will prove disruptive to the national economy – tourism, agriculture and fisheries, the largest contributors to the nation&#x27;s GDP, will be severely impacted by climate change causing increases in poverty and food insecurity. As a party to both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Climate Agreement, Fiji hopes to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 which, along with national policies, will help to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

== Tectonics ==
Fiji is located on the northeast corner of the Indo-Australian plate near where it subducts under the Pacific plate on the North Fiji Basin microplate between the North Fiji Fracture Zone on the north and the Hunter fracture zone on the south. It is part of the Ring of Fire, the string of volcanoes around the boundary of the Pacific Ocean.

== Extreme points ==
This is a list of the extreme points of Fiji, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point – Uea Island, Rotuma, Eastern Division
* Easternmost point – Vatoa Island, Eastern Division
* Southernmost point – Ceva-i-Ra island, Western Division
* Westernmost point – Viwa Island, Western Division

==Ecology==
Fiji has more than three hundred islands, four of which are of a significant size. From largest to smallest, these four islands are Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Kadavu Island, and Taveuni Island. The Fiji islands are home to numerous indigenous flora and fauna. These include:
* Fiji banded iguana
* Fiji crested iguana

Fiji once hosted several now-extinct Pleistocene and Holocene species, including a large crocodilian of the genus &quot;Volia&quot;, which was likely the apex predator of its environment. Other notable extinct species include &quot;Lapitiguana impensa&quot;, a giant iguana, as well as the flightless Viti Levu giant pigeon.

<text>Cadbury, formerly Cadbury&#x27;s and Cadbury Schweppes, is a British multinational confectionery company owned by Mondelez International (spun off from Kraft Foods) since 2010. It is the second-largest confectionery brand in the world, after Mars. Cadbury is internationally headquartered in Greater London, and operates in more than 50 countries worldwide. It is known for its Dairy Milk chocolate, the Creme Egg and Roses selection box, and many other confectionery products. One of the best-known British brands, in 2013 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named Cadbury among Britain&#x27;s most successful exports.

Cadbury was founded in 1824 in Birmingham, England, by John Cadbury (1801–1889), a Quaker who sold tea, coffee and drinking chocolate. Cadbury developed the business with his brother Benjamin, followed by his sons Richard and George. George developed the Bournville estate, a model village designed to give the company&#x27;s workers improved living conditions. Dairy Milk chocolate, introduced by George Jr in 1905, used a higher proportion of milk in the recipe than rival products. By 1914, it was the company&#x27;s best-selling product. Successive members of the Cadbury family have made innovations with chocolate products. Cadbury, Rowntree&#x27;s and Fry&#x27;s were the big three British confectionery manufacturers throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Cadbury was granted its first royal warrant from Queen Victoria in 1854. It held a royal warrant from Elizabeth II from 1955 to 2022. Cadbury merged with J. S. Fry &amp; Sons in 1919, and Schweppes in 1969, known as Cadbury Schweppes until 2008, when the American beverage business was split as Dr Pepper Snapple Group; the rights ownership of the Schweppes brand had already differed between various countries since 2006. In 1992, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the company for 24 years, produced the Cadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world. Cadbury was a constant constituent of the FTSE 100 on the London Stock Exchange from the index&#x27;s 1984 inception until the company was bought by Kraft Foods Inc. in 2010.

== History ==
=== 1800–1900: Early history ===

On 4 March 1824, John Cadbury, a Quaker, began selling tea, coffee and drinking chocolate in Bull Street in Birmingham, England. From 1831, he moved into the production of a variety of cocoa and drinking chocolates, made in a factory in Bridge Street and sold mainly to the wealthy because of the high cost of production. In 1842, he started selling chocolate for eating, perhaps the first in Britain. In 1847, John Cadbury became a partner with his brother Benjamin and the company became known as &quot;Cadbury Brothers&quot;. In 1847, Cadbury&#x27;s competitor Fry&#x27;s of Bristol produced the first chocolate bar (which would be mass-produced as Fry&#x27;s Chocolate Cream in 1866). Cadbury introduced his brand of the chocolate bar in 1849, and that same year, Cadbury and Fry&#x27;s chocolate bars were displayed publicly at a trade fair in Bingley Hall, Birmingham. The Cadbury brothers opened an office in London, and, in 1854, they received the royal warrant as manufacturers of chocolate and cocoa to Queen Victoria. The company went into decline in the late 1850s.

John Cadbury&#x27;s sons Richard and George took over the business in 1861. At the time of the takeover, the business was in rapid decline: the number of employees had reduced from 20 to 11, and the company was losing money. By 1866, Cadbury was profitable again. The brothers had turned around the business by moving the focus from tea and coffee to chocolate, and by increasing the quality of their products.
The firm&#x27;s first major breakthrough occurred in 1866, when Richard and George introduced an improved cocoa into Britain. A new cocoa press developed in the Netherlands removed some of the unpalatable cocoa butter from the cocoa bean. The firm began exporting its products in the 1850s. In 1861, the company created Fancy Boxes (a decorated box of chocolates) and, in 1868, they were sold in boxes in the shape of a heart for Valentine&#x27;s Day. Boxes of filled chocolates quickly became associated with the holiday.

Cadbury manufactured their first Easter egg in 1875, creating the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could be moulded into smooth shapes. By 1893, Cadbury had 19 different varieties of chocolate Easter egg on sale.

In 1878, the brothers decided to build new premises in countryside from Birmingham. The move to the countryside was unprecedented in business. Better transport access for milk that was shipped inward by canal, and cocoa that was brought in by rail from London, Southampton and Liverpool docks was taken into consideration. With the development of the Birmingham West Suburban Railway along the path of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, they acquired the Bournbrook estate, comprising of countryside south of Birmingham. Located next to the Stirchley Street railway station, which itself was opposite the canal, they renamed the estate Bournville and opened the Bournville factory in 1879. In 1891, the Cadbury brothers filed a patent for a chocolate-coated biscuit.

In 1893, George Cadbury bought of land close to the works and planned, at his own expense, a model village which would &#x27;alleviate the evils of modern more cramped living conditions&#x27;. By 1900, the estate included 314 cottages and houses set on of land. As the Cadbury family were Quakers, there were no pubs in the estate.

In 1897, following the lead of Swiss companies, Cadbury introduced its own line of milk chocolate bars. In 1899, Cadbury was incorporated as a private limited company at the Companies House in London.

===1900–1969===
In 1905, Cadbury launched its Dairy Milk bar, a high quality product with a greater proportion of milk than previous chocolate bars. Developed by George&#x27;s son, George Cadbury Jr (along with his research and development team), it was the first time a British company had been able to mass-produce milk chocolate. From the beginning, it had the distinctive purple wrapper. It was a great sales success, and became the company&#x27;s best-selling product by 1914. The stronger Bournville Cocoa line was introduced in 1906. Cadbury Dairy Milk and Bournville Cocoa were to provide the basis for the company&#x27;s rapid pre-war expansion. In 1910, Cadbury sales overtook those of Fry for the first time.

Cadbury&#x27;s Milk Tray was first produced in 1915 and continued in production throughout the remainder of the First World War. More than 2,000 of Cadbury&#x27;s male employees joined the British Armed Forces, and to support the British war effort, Cadbury provided chocolate, books and clothing to the troops. George Cadbury handed over two company-owned buildings for use as hospitals – &quot;The Beeches&quot; and &quot;Fircroft&quot;, and the management of both hospitals earned the War Office&#x27;s highest award. Factory girls, dubbed &#x27;The Cadbury Angels&#x27;, volunteered to do the laundry of injured soldiers recovering in the hospitals. After the war, the Bournville factory was redeveloped and mass production began in earnest. In 1918, Cadbury opened their first overseas factory in Hobart, Tasmania. A trainline was also built for easier access to Hobart. Of the 16 women who came to Tasmania to set up the factory, seven are known to have returned to the UK, two married and stayed in Tasmania, two did not marry but stayed and five left no record.
In 1919, Cadbury merged with Fry&#x27;s, resulting in the integration of well-known brands such as Fry&#x27;s Chocolate Cream and Fry&#x27;s Turkish Delight. In 1921, the many small Fry&#x27;s factories around Bristol were closed down, and production was consolidated at a new Somerdale Factory, outside Bristol.

Cadbury expanded its product range with Flake (1920), Creme eggs (1923), Fruit and Nut (1928), and Crunchie (1929, originally under the Fry&#x27;s label). By 1930, Cadbury was the 24th-largest British manufacturing company as measured by estimated market value of capital. Cadbury took direct control of the under-performing Fry in 1935. Dairy Milk Whole Nut arrived in 1933, and tins of Roses were introduced in 1938 (competing with Quality Street launched by Mackintosh&#x27;s in 1936). Roses has become a very popular Christmas (and Mother&#x27;s Day) gift.

By the mid-1930s, Cadbury estimated that 90 percent of the British population could readily afford to buy chocolate as it was no longer considered a luxury item for the working classes. By 1936, Dairy Milk accounted for 60 per cent of the UK milk chocolate market. Between the two world wars Cadbury sent test packages to British schoolchildren in exchange for their opinions on new products, one of whom, Roald Dahl, would later write the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

During the Second World War, parts of the Bournville factory were turned over to war work, producing milling machines and seats for fighter aircraft. Workers ploughed football fields to plant crops. As chocolate was regarded as an essential food, it was placed under government supervision for the entire war. The wartime rationing of chocolate ended in 1950, and normal production resumed. Cadbury subsequently invested in new factories and had an increasing demand for their products. In 1952 the Moreton factory was built.

In 1967, Cadbury acquired an Australian confectioner, MacRobertson&#x27;s, beating a rival bid from Mars. As a result of the takeover, Cadbury built a 60 per cent market share in the Australian market.

Cadbury was a holder of a royal warrant from Queen Elizabeth II from 1955 to 2022. A warrant from King Charles III was held for a further two years, but was dropped in 2024 due to Mondelez International still operating in Russia.

=== Schweppes merger (1969) ===
Cadbury merged with drinks company Schweppes to form Cadbury Schweppes in 1969. Head of Schweppes, Lord Watkinson, became chairman, and Adrian Cadbury became deputy chairman and managing director. The benefits of the merger were to prove elusive. The merger put an end to Cadbury&#x27;s close links to its Quaker founding family.
In 1978, the company acquired Peter Paul, the third largest chocolate manufacturer in the United States for $58 million, which gave it a 10 per cent share of the world&#x27;s largest confectionery market. The successful Wispa chocolate bar was launched in the North East of England in 1981, and nationwide in 1984. In 1982, trading profits were greater outside of Britain than in the UK for the first time.

In 1986, Cadbury Schweppes sold its Beverages and Foods division to a management buyout known as Premier Brands for £97 million. This saw the company divest itself of such brands as Typhoo Tea, Kenco, Smash and Hartley Chivers jam. It also saw Premier take the licence for production of Cadbury brand biscuits and drinking chocolate.
Meanwhile, Schweppes switched its alliance in the UK from Pepsi to Coca-Cola, taking a 51 per cent stake in the joint venture Coca-Cola Schweppes. The acquisition of Canada Dry doubled its worldwide drinks market share, and it took a 30 per cent stake in Dr Pepper. As a result of these acquisitions, Cadbury Schweppes became the third largest soft drinks manufacturer in the world. In August 1988, the company sold its U.S. confectionery operations to Hershey&#x27;s for $284.5 million cash plus the assumption of $30 million in debt.

In 1992, company chairman Sir Adrian Cadbury produced the Cadbury Report (via the Cadbury committee set up by the London Stock Exchange), a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world. In 1993, Cadbury Schweppes acquired A&amp;W. In 1995, Cadbury Schweppes acquired Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies. In 1999, Cadbury Schweppes sold its worldwide beverage businesses to The Coca-Cola Company except in North America and continental Europe for $700 million.

Snapple, Mistic and Stewart&#x27;s (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion. In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc. In 2003, Cadbury Schweppes acquired Adams, the US chewing gum operations of Pfizer Inc., for $4.2 billion, making Cadbury the world&#x27;s biggest confectionery company. In 2005, Cadbury Schweppes acquired Green &amp; Black&#x27;s for £20 million.

==== Schweppes demerger ====
In March 2007, it was revealed that Cadbury Schweppes was planning to split its business into two separate entities: one focusing on its main chocolate and confectionery market; the other on its US drinks business. The demerger took effect on 2 May 2008, with the drinks business becoming Dr Pepper Snapple Group and Cadbury Schweppes plc becoming Cadbury plc. In December 2008 it was announced that Cadbury was to sell its Australian beverage unit to Asahi Breweries.

=== 2007–2010 ===
In October 2007, Cadbury announced the closure of the Somerdale Factory, in Keynsham, Somerset, formerly part of Fry&#x27;s. Between 500 and 700 jobs were affected by this change. Production transferred to other plants in England and Poland.

In 2008, Monkhill Confectionery, the Own Label trading division of Cadbury Trebor Bassett was sold to Tangerine Confectionery for £58 million. This sale included factories at Pontefract, Cleckheaton and York and a distribution centre near Chesterfield, and the transfer of around 800 employees.

In mid-2009, Cadbury replaced some of the cocoa butter in their non-UK chocolate products with palm oil. Despite stating this was a response to consumer demand to improve taste and texture, there was no &quot;new improved recipe&quot; claim placed on New Zealand labels. Consumer backlash was significant from environmentalists and chocolate lovers in both Australia and New Zealand, with consumers objecting to both the taste from the cheaper formulation, and the use of palm oil given its role in the destruction of rainforests. By August 2009, the company announced that it was reverting to the use of cocoa butter in New Zealand and Australia, although palm oil is still listed as an ingredient in Cadbury&#x27;s flavoured sugar syrup based fillings (where it referred to as &#x27;vegetable oil&#x27;). In addition, Cadbury stated it would source cocoa beans through Fair Trade channels. In January 2010 prospective buyer Kraft pledged to honour Cadbury&#x27;s commitment.

=== Acquisition and subsidiary (2009–present) ===

On 7 September 2009, Kraft Foods made a £10.2 billion (US$16.2 billion) indicative takeover bid for Cadbury. The offer was rejected, with Cadbury stating that it undervalued the company. Kraft launched a formal, hostile bid for Cadbury, valuing the firm at £9.8 billion on 9 November 2009. The UK Business Secretary Peter Mandelson warned Kraft not to try to &quot;make a quick buck&quot; from the acquisition of Cadbury.

On 19 January 2010, it was announced that Cadbury and Kraft Foods had reached a deal and that Kraft would purchase Cadbury for £8.40 per share, valuing Cadbury at £11.5bn (US$18.9bn). Kraft, which issued a statement stating that the deal will create a &quot;global confectionery leader&quot;, had to borrow £7 billion (US$11.5bn) in order to finance the takeover.

The Hershey Company, based in Pennsylvania, manufactures and distributes Cadbury-branded chocolate (but not its other confectionery) in the United States and has been reported to share Cadbury&#x27;s &quot;ethos&quot;. Hershey had expressed an interest in buying Cadbury because it would broaden its access to faster-growing international markets. But on 22 January 2010, Hershey announced that it would not counter Kraft&#x27;s final offer.

The acquisition of Cadbury faced widespread disapproval from the British public, as well as groups and organisations including trade union Unite, who fought against the acquisition of the company which, according to Prime Minister Gordon Brown, was very important to the British economy. Unite estimated that a takeover by Kraft could put 30,000 jobs &quot;at risk&quot;, and UK shareholders protested over the mergers and acquisitions advisory fees charged by banks. Cadbury&#x27;s M&amp;A advisers were UBS, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Controversially, RBS, a bank 84% owned by the United Kingdom Government, funded the Kraft takeover.
On 2 February 2010, Kraft secured over 71% of Cadbury&#x27;s shares thus finalising the deal. Kraft had needed to reach 75% of the shares in order to be able to delist Cadbury from the stock market and fully integrate it as part of Kraft. This was achieved on 5 February, and the company announced that Cadbury shares would be de-listed on 8 March. On 3 February, the Chairman Roger Carr, chief executive Todd Stitzer and chief financial officer Andrew Bonfield all announced their resignations. Stitzer had worked at the company for 27 years. On 9 February, Kraft announced that it was planning to close the Somerdale Factory, Keynsham, with the loss of 400 jobs. The management explained that existing plans to move production to Poland were too advanced to be realistically reversed, though assurances had been given regarding sustaining the plant. Staff at Keynsham criticised this move, suggesting that they felt betrayed and as if they have been &quot;sacked twice&quot;. On 22 April 2010, Phil Rumbol, the man behind the famous Cadbury &quot;Gorilla&quot; advertisement, announced his plans to leave the Cadbury company in July following Kraft&#x27;s takeover.
The European Commission decided that Kraft would have to divest Cadbury&#x27;s confectionery businesses in Poland (Wedel) and Romania (Kandia). In June 2010, the Polish division, Cadbury-Wedel, was sold to Lotte of Korea. As part of the deal Kraft kept the Cadbury, Hall&#x27;s and other brands along with two plants in Skarbimierz. Lotte took over the plant in Warsaw along with the E Wedel brand. Kandia was sold back to the Meinl family, which had owned the brand from 2003 to 2007.

On 4 August 2011, Kraft Foods announced it would be splitting into two companies beginning on 1 October 2012. The snack and confectionery business of Kraft became Mondelez International, of which Cadbury would become a subsidiary.

In response to diminishing margins in early 2014, Mondelez hired Accenture to implement a US$3 billion cost-cutting programme of the company&#x27;s assets including Cadbury and Oreo. Beginning in 2015, Mondelez began closing Cadbury factories in several developed countries including Ireland, Canada, the United States, and New Zealand and shifting production to &quot;advantaged&quot; country locations like China, India, Brazil, and Mexico. The closure of Cadbury factories in centres such as Dublin, Montreal, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Dunedin in New Zealand generated outcries from the local populations. The plan received approval from several market shareholders including the Australian and New Zealand banks Westpac and ASB Bank.

In January 2017, Cadbury became the official snack partner of the Premier League, and sponsored the Premier League Golden Boot and Premier League Golden Glove awards.

====2024: 200th anniversary====
On 8 January 2024, Mondelez International announced plans to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Cadbury, including: promotions, celebrations, and seven retro packaging designs for its Cadbury Dairy Milk bars.

On 23 December 2024, it was announced that after 170 years since the reign of Queen Victoria, Cadbury would now no longer hold its Royal Warrant under King Charles III. In a statement by a Mondelez spokesperson: &quot;Whilst we are disappointed to be one of hundreds of other businesses and brands in the UK [...] to not have a new warrant awarded, we are proud to have previously held one, and we fully respect the decision.&quot;

== Operations ==

===Head office===

Cadbury has its head office at Cadbury House in the Uxbridge Business Park in Uxbridge, Greater London, England.
The company occupies of leased space inside Building 3 of the business park, which it shares with Mondelez&#x27;s UK division. After acquiring Cadbury, Kraft confirmed that the company would remain at Cadbury House.

Cadbury relocated to Uxbridge Business Park from its previous head office at 25 Berkeley Square in Mayfair, City of Westminster in 2007 as a cost-saving measure. In 1992, the company leased the space for £55 per square foot (0.093 m2); by 2002 this had reached £68.75 per square foot.

===Production sites===

====Bournville====

Located south of Birmingham in England, the Cadbury plant in Bournville was opened in 1879 by company founder John Cadbury&#x27;s son George, whose aim was that one-tenth of the Bournville estate should be &quot;laid out and used as parks, recreation grounds and open space.&quot; It subsequently became known as &quot;the factory in a garden&quot;. Cadbury&#x27;s dark chocolate bar, Bournville, is named after the model village, and was first sold in 1908.

Bournville employs almost 1,000 people. In 2014, Mondelez announced a £75 million investment in the site, with Cadbury stating it &quot;reinforces Bournville&#x27;s position at the heart of the British chocolate industry&quot;.

Bournville is home to Mondelez&#x27;s Global Centre of Excellence for chocolate research and development, so every new chocolate product created by Cadbury starts life at the Birmingham plant.

==Markets==

=== United Kingdom ===
The confectionery business in the UK is called Cadbury (formerly Cadbury Trebor Bassett) and, as of August 2004, had eight factories and 3,000 staff in the UK. Mondelez also sells biscuits bearing the Cadbury brand, such as Cadbury Fingers. Mondelez also owns Fry&#x27;s and Maynards Bassetts (created by merging Bassett&#x27;s with Maynards).

Ice cream based on Cadbury products, like 99 Flake, is made under licence by Frederick&#x27;s Dairies. Cadbury cakes and chocolate spread are manufactured under licence by Premier Foods, but the cakes were originally part of Cadbury Foods Ltd with factories at Blackpole in Worcester and Moreton on the Wirral, with distribution depots throughout the UK.

Other Kraft subsidiaries in the UK include Cadbury Two LLP, Cadbury UK Holdings Limited, Cadbury US Holdings Limited, Cadbury Four LLP, Cadbury Holdings Limited, and Cadbury One LLP.

According to the environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy, Cadbury chocolate wrappers along with Walkers crisps packets and Coca-Cola cans were the three top brands that were the most common pieces of rubbish found in UK streets in 2013. In 2014, Cadbury Dairy Milk was ranked the best-selling chocolate bar in the UK. A 2018 YouGov poll saw Cadbury&#x27;s Chocolate Digestives ranked the second most popular biscuit in the UK after McVitie&#x27;s Chocolate Digestives.

=== Ireland ===

Cadbury Ireland Limited is based in Coolock in Dublin, where the headquarters of Cadbury Ireland are located, and Rathmore, County Kerry. Products made by Cadbury in Ireland include Cadbury Dairy Milk Range, Cadbury Twirl, Cadbury Cadbury Snacks Range Flake and Boost (formerly Moro). Cadbury used to produce the Time Out bar in Ireland for the European market however this production was moved to Poland.

=== United States ===

Cadbury USA produces candy, gum, breath mints and cough drops. It is headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey. The company was formed after the then Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Adams brand from Pfizer in December 2002 for US$4.2 billion.

American Chicle was purchased by Warner–Lambert in 1962; Warner-Lambert renamed the unit Adams in 1997 and merged with Pfizer in 2000.

In 1978, Cadbury merged with Peter Paul, makers of Mounds and Almond Joy. In 1988, The Hershey Company acquired the U.S. rights to its chocolate business. Accordingly, although the Cadbury group&#x27;s chocolate products have been sold in the U.S. since 1988, they are manufactured by Hershey, causing complaints by consumers, who claim the Hershey-made products are inferior to the originals. Before the May 2008 demerger, the North American business also contained beverage unit Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages. In 1982, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Duffy-Mott Company.

===Australia===

Cadbury&#x27;s products were first imported into Australia as early as 1853 when 3 cases of Cadbury&#x27;s cocoa and chocolate were advertised for sale in Adelaide. Cadbury&#x27;s first overseas order in 1881 was made for the Australian market. In 1919, as part of its plans to expand internationally, the company decided to build a factory in Australia. Tasmania was chosen as the location of Cadbury&#x27;s first factory outside of the United Kingdom, due to its close proximity to the city of Hobart, good source of inexpensive hydro-electricity and plentiful supply of high-quality fresh milk. Cadbury&#x27;s Claremont was modelled on Bournville, with its own village and sporting facilities.
The first products from Claremont were sold in 1922.
Cadbury&#x27;s Claremont was once a popular tourist attraction and operated daily tours; however, the factory ceased running full tours mid-2008, citing health and safety reasons.
Cadbury has been upgrading its manufacturing facility at Claremont, Tasmania, Australia, since 2001.
Cadbury&#x27;s Claremont is the largest chocolate factory in the Southern Hemisphere, producing a company-record of over of chocolate in 2021. Cadbury also operates a milk-processing plant in Cooee, Tasmania and two other factories in Melbourne, Victoria (Ringwood and Scoresby).

On 27 February 2009, the confectionery and beverages businesses of Cadbury Schweppes in Australia were formally separated and the beverages business began operating as Schweppes Australia Pty Ltd. In April 2009, Schweppes Australia was acquired by Asahi Breweries.

In 2015, the Australian Cadbury factory, located in Hobart, reduced its work force by 80 and in 2017 closed its visitor&#x27;s centre. In August 2017, Cadbury announced that 50 workers will be shed from its Hobart factory. Within Australia there is debate regarding halal certification. Many of Cadbury&#x27;s products are halal certified. This certification has generated controversy, especially from One Nation politician Pauline Hanson.

===New Zealand===

Cadbury had also operated a factory in Dunedin in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island until its closure in March 2018. In 1930, Cadbury partnered with local confectionery businessman Richard Hudson, who owned a chocolate, confectionery, biscuit factory on Castle Street. Hudson&#x27;s factory was rebranded as Cadbury Hudson and later became known as the Cadbury Confectionery. Cadbury later established a second factory in Auckland in the North Island. In 2003, Cadbury established a tourist attraction on the premises of the Dunedin factory known as Cadbury World, which featured a large chocolate waterfall. In 2007, Cadbury closed down its Auckland factory, leading to the loss of 200 jobs. In 2009, the Cadbury Dunedin factory attracted criticism from consumers and local environmentalists when it replaced cocoa butter with palm oil. In response, the company backtracked but still retained palm oil as a filling in some ingredients. Over the next several years, Cadbury began downsizing its products, including trimming chocolate blocks in 2015.

On 16 February 2017, it was reported that Cadbury would be closing its factory in Dunedin, New Zealand by March 2018. This is estimated to lead to the loss of 350 jobs. Amanda Banfield, Mondelez&#x27;s vice-president for Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, clarified that the closure was done due to Mondelez&#x27;s decision to shift chocolate manufacturing to Cadbury&#x27;s Australian factories. However, Mondelez has also confirmed that Dunedin&#x27;s Cadbury World tourist attraction would remain open due to its popularity with tourists.

Following four weeks of consultations with local Cadbury employees, the Mayor of Dunedin Dave Cull, and local trade union representatives, Banfield confirmed that the closure would go ahead the following year due to the lack of viable options to continue production in New Zealand. She also confirmed that Cadbury would offer a redundancy support package to staff and would also sponsor staff willing to move to Australia to work. Mondelez also confirmed that it was looking for a third-party manufacturer to continue making Cadbury&#x27;s New Zealand brands Pineapple Lumps, Jaffas, Chocolate Fish and Buzz Bar. In early June 2017, local city councillor Jim O&#x27;Malley and a group of volunteers launched a crowdfunding campaign to keep the Dunedin factory running on a portion of the site. They formed a group called Dunedin Manufacturing Holdings (DMH). Despite generating NZ$6 million in funds, DMH abandoned its bid on 22 June due to Mondelez&#x27;s stringent production and supply requirements and difficulties in acquiring manpower and machinery. Mondelez has also indicated that it is negotiating with two local chocolate companies to ensure the production of iconic local brands such as Pineapple Lumps, Jaffas, Chocolate Fish, Buzz Bars, and Pinky Bars in New Zealand.

On 17 October 2017, Cadbury announced that it would be shifting all production of its New Zealand brands to Australia after failing to find a local supplier. The termination of New Zealand production took effect in March 2018. Mondelez&#x27;s New Zealand country head James Kane confirmed the shift on the grounds that the production of Cadbury products would require certain technologies, production processes and skills that local New Zealand manufacturers lacked.

On 4 May, it was reported that the Dunedin Cadbury World would be closing down after the Ministry of Health purchased the entire former Cadbury factory site to make way for a new public hospital. Mondelez area vice-president Banfield confirmed that Cadbury had sold the former factory site to the Ministry of Health for an undisclosed amount.

=== Canada ===

=== India ===

In 1948, Cadbury India began its operations in India by importing chocolates. On 19 July 1948, Cadbury was incorporated in India. It now has manufacturing facilities in Thane, Induri (Pune) and Malanpur (Bhind), Hyderabad, Bangalore and Baddi (Himachal Pradesh) and sales offices in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. The corporate head office is in Mumbai. The head office is presently situated at Pedder Road, Mumbai, under the name of &quot;Cadbury House&quot;. Since 1965 Cadbury has also pioneered the development of cocoa cultivation in India. For over two decades, Cadbury has worked with the Kerala Agricultural University to undertake cocoa research.

Currently, Cadbury India operates in five categories – Chocolate confectionery, Beverages, Biscuits, Gum and Candy. Its products include Cadbury Dairy Milk, Dairy Milk Silk, Bournville, Temptations, Perk, Eclairs, Bournvita, Celebrations, Gems, Bubbaloo, Cadbury Dairy Milk Shots, Halls, Bilkul, Tang, and Oreo.

It is the Indian market leader in the chocolate confectionery business with a market share of over 70%. On 21 April 2014, Cadbury India changed its name to Mondelez India Foods Limited. In 2017, Cadbury/Mondelez agreed to pay a $13 million FCPA penalty for making illicit payments to government officials to obtain licences and approvals to build a factory in Baddi.

==== Issues ====
In 2003, &quot;Businessworld&quot; in India reported there were &#x27;Insects found in Cadbury&#x27;s chocolates&#x27;. In 2021, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) carried out raids in Haryana and Himachal on Cadbury India Ltd premises. CBI filed FIR against Cadbury for corruption in connection with obtaining Himachal factory licence. CBI said Cadbury allegedly conspired with central excise officials between 2009 and 2011 and availed excise benefits to the tune of Rs 241 crore for its new unit in Himachal Pradesh.

=== Malta ===

In 2012, Alf Mizzi &amp; Sons Marketing (Ltd) took over the importation and distribution of Cadbury, as well as several other Mondelez brands. Most of the Cadbury products are imported directly from the UK. The advertising of the brand was taken over by Sloane Ltd., which proved to be highly successful in creating market specific commercials, reaching more of the Maltese population than ever through digital advertising.

=== South Africa ===
Cadbury was introduced to South Africa in 1903 by the Cadbury brothers, Richard and George. The brothers appointed a sales agent to sell their products to the locals. The brand&#x27;s popularity grew such that in 1926, the South African arm of Cadbury was formed and plans were made to construct a local chocolate manufacturing plant.

Cadbury broke ground with a chocolate plant in Port Elizabeth in 1930. By 1938, the first locally produced moulded Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate slabs were produced. The first slabs of chocolate produced were the &quot;Milk, Nut Milk, Milk Fruit, Nut Brazil, Fruit &amp; Nut and Bournville&quot; variety of Cadbury products.

In the 1950s, the Port Elizabeth factory was expanded to include a new laboratory in order to start producing new products, such as the &quot;Flake&quot; and &quot;Crunchie Bar&quot; (1960s). By the 1970s, the factory was expanded again to add a new Raw Materials Store and crumb silos. These have since become a local landmark. The same factory still produces some of the supply of Cadbury chocolate in South Africa.

In 2011, Kraft Foods, the company that then owned Cadbury, announced that it would be launching a fair-trade Dairy Milk chocolate bar on the South African market. The product had been available in other countries where Cadbury operated since 2009. The South African operation of Cadbury has a completely Africa-based supply chain, with cocoa beans bought in Ghana and the chocolate bars made in the factory at Port Elizabeth.

==Advertising==
The Cadbury script logo is derived from the signature of William Cadbury, the founder&#x27;s grandson, in 1921. It was adopted as the worldwide logo in the 1970s. Adopting purple as the company&#x27;s colour in 1905 to honour Queen Victoria who had died four years prior, Cadbury famously trademarked purple for chocolates with registrations in 1995 and 2004. However, the validity of these trademarks is the matter of an ongoing legal dispute following objections by Nestlé.

In 1928, Cadbury&#x27;s introduced the &quot;glass and a half&quot; slogan to accompany the Cadbury Dairy Milk bar, to advertise the bar&#x27;s higher milk content. The Creme Egg slogan, &quot;How do you eat yours?&quot;, inviting people to think about how they eat their eggs, was introduced in 1985. The brand has used immersive experiential marketing campaigns which include a Double Decker fun bus, Joy Generator machine and pop-up cafes. Cadbury has had famous names on their products, such as a Paddington Bear-branded chocolate bar in 1977, and Spice Girls-branded chocolate (chocolate bars, selection boxes, Easter Eggs) at the height of their 1990s success.
Four commercials for Cadbury products on British television featured in the top 50 of Channel 4&#x27;s 2000 UK poll of the &quot;100 Greatest Adverts&quot;. Cadbury Flake, featuring Flake Girl from 1959 onward, was ranked 26th, Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit &amp; Nut, featuring the slogan &quot;Everyone&#x27;s a fruit and nutcase&quot; from 1977 onward, sung by comedian Frank Muir, ranked 36th, Fry&#x27;s Turkish Delight, with the slogan &quot;Full of Eastern Promise&quot; from 1957 onward, which included model Jane Lumb, ranked 37th, and Cadbury Milk Tray (which since 1968 has been advertised by the &#x27;Milk Tray Man&#x27;, a tough James Bond–style figure who undertakes daunting &#x27;raids&#x27; to secretively deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady), the &quot;Avalanche&quot; advert where he races ahead of it to deliver the chocolates, ranked 48th. The 2007 &quot;Gorilla&quot; television commercial promoting Cadbury Dairy Milk – featuring Phil Collins &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; – won numerous awards, including Gold at the British Television Advertising Awards in 2008.

Every year Cadbury also launches a Secret Santa campaign which features offline and online advertisements. The brand also tours the UK&#x27;s major cities encouraging people to anonymously give their loved ones a free chocolate bar. Cadbury has specifically designed booths for the occasion but in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic the campaign was done virtually.

== Products ==



Major chocolate brands produced by Cadbury include the bars Dairy Milk, Crunchie, Double Decker, Caramel, Wispa, Boost, Picnic, Flake, Curly Wurly, Chomp, and Fudge; chocolate Buttons; the boxed chocolate brand Milk Tray; and the twist-wrapped chocolates Heroes which are most popular around holidays, such as Christmas and Halloween (Cadbury Goo Heads (similar to Creme Eggs) are released for Halloween). Selection boxes (containing a selection of Cadbury bars and sweets) is a staple Christmas gift of chocolate, a tradition that in Britain goes back over a century (as are Cadbury Roses since the late 1930s). Creme Eggs are only sold between New Year&#x27;s Day (or sometimes Boxing Day) and Easter—it is the most popular chocolate in the UK during this period, outselling its closest rival by 2 to 1.

As well as Cadbury&#x27;s chocolate, the company also owns Maynards and Halls, and is associated with several types of confectionery including former Trebor and Bassett&#x27;s brands or products such as Liquorice Allsorts, Jelly Babies, Flumps, Mints, Black Jack chews, Trident gum, and Softmints. Global sales of Cadbury products amounted to £491 million in the 52 weeks to 16 August 2014.

Notable product introductions include:

==Incidents==
=== 2006 salmonella scare ===
On 20 January 2006, Cadbury Schweppes detected a strain of the &quot;Salmonella&quot; montevideo (SmvdX07) bacteria, affecting seven of its products. The contamination was caused by a leaking pipe, from which waste water dripped onto a chocolate crumb production line at the company&#x27;s plant in Marlbrook, Herefordshire. It was not until around six months after the leak was detected that Cadbury Schweppes notified the Food Standards Agency, a delay which Cadbury Schweppes was unable to explain satisfactorily, and for which it was criticised. The Food Standards Agency ordered the company to recall more than a million chocolate bars. In December 2006, the company announced that the cost of dealing with the incident reached £30 million.

In April 2007, Birmingham City Council announced that it would be prosecuting Cadbury Schweppes in relation to three alleged offences of breaching food safety legislation. At that time, the Health Protection Agency identified 37 people who had been infected with Salmonella montevideo. One of the alleged victims had to be kept on a hospital isolation ward for five days after eating a Cadbury&#x27;s caramel bar. An investigation that was carried by Herefordshire Council led to a further six charges being brought. The company pleaded guilty to all nine charges, and was fined one million pounds at Birmingham Crown Court — the sentencing of both cases was brought together. Analysts have said the fine is not material to the group, with mitigating factors limiting the fine being that the company quickly admitted its guilt and said it had been mistaken that the infection did not pose a threat to health.

=== 2007 recalls ===
On 10 February 2007, Cadbury recalled some of its Easter eggs due to a labelling error. The products were produced in a factory handling nuts, potential allergens, but this was not made clear on the packaging. Cadbury said the products were &quot;perfectly safe&quot; for people without nut allergies to eat.

On 14 September 2007, Cadbury Schweppes investigated a manufacturing error over allergy warning, recalling for the second time in two years thousands of chocolate bars. A printing mistake at Somerdale Factory resulted in the omission of tree nut allergy labels from 250g Dairy Milk Double Chocolate bars.

===2008 melamine contamination in China===
On 29 September 2008, Cadbury withdrew all of its 11 chocolate products made in its three Beijing factories, on suspicion of contamination with melamine. The recall affected the mainland China markets, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia. Products recalled included Dark Chocolate, a number of products in the &#x27;Dairy Milk&#x27; range and Chocolate Eclairs.

=== 2014 pork traces in Malaysia ===
Cadbury recalled two chocolate products after it was tested positive for traces of pork DNA, namely Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut and Cadbury Dairy Milk Roast Almond. The traces were found during a periodic check for non-halal ingredients in food products by the Ministry of Health in Malaysia which on 24 May 2014 said two of three samples of the company&#x27;s products may contain pork traces.

On 2 June 2014, Malaysia&#x27;s Department of Islamic Development (JAKIM) declared that the sample did not contain pig DNA, as claimed in earlier reports. This statement was made after new tests were conducted.

JAKIM reportedly said in a statement that it tested 11 samples of Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut, Cadbury Dairy Milk Roast Almond and other products from the company&#x27;s factory but none of them tested positive for pork. The investigation followed reports that unscheduled checks had shown that two chocolates produced by Mondelez International Inc., the parent company of Cadbury, violated Islamic law and led to a boycott of all its products in the country.

=== 2017 &quot;Easter&quot; controversy ===
In 2017, the Church of England condemned the company and the National Trust for rebranding their annual &quot;Easter Egg Trails&quot; as &quot;Cadbury Egg Hunts&quot;. Prime Minister Theresa May called the rebranding &quot;absolutely ridiculous&quot;; however, Cadbury dismissed the criticism, with a spokesperson saying, &quot;it is clear to see that within our communications we visibly state the word Easter. It is included a number of times across promotional materials.&quot; An ensuing controversy followed in Australia, where Cadbury was accused of removing the word &#x27;Easter&#x27; from the packaging of its Easter eggs. Cadbury Australia responded that Easter was mentioned on &quot;the back of [the] pack&quot;, and that its eggs were obviously Easter eggs.

=== 2019 &quot;Cadbury Treasures&quot; campaign ===
In the run-up to Easter 2019, Cadbury launched a &quot;Treasures&quot; promotion in the UK and Ireland that, as well as listing treasure exhibits in various museums, unintentionally encouraged people to engage in illegal metal-detecting and digging at protected archaeological sites around the British Isles in search of further treasure. This prompted a highly critical reaction from archaeologists.

=== 2022 Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; child labour claims ===
In 2022, &quot;Cadbury Exposed: Dispatches&quot; aired on Channel 4 revealed child labour in cocoa farming for Cadbury chocolate. Mondelez International initially refused to comment before releasing a statement after the programme had aired. The network&#x27;s journalists claimed Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put had &quot;refused to be interviewed&quot; but the company &quot;did not dispute our findings (and were) deeply concerned by the incidents documented by Dispatches and would launch an investigation.&quot;

=== 2023 Listeria recall ===
In May 2023, Muller recalled six Cadbury desserts because of the possible presence of listeria, described as a &quot;precautionary measure&quot;.

<text>The demographic characteristics of the population of Fiji are known through censuses, usually conducted in ten-year intervals, and has been analysed by statistical bureaus since the 1880s. The Fijian Bureau of Statistics (FBOS) has performed this task since 1996, the first enumerated Fiji census when an independent country. The 2017 census found that the permanent population of Fiji was 884,887, compared to 837,271 in the 2007 census. The population density at the time in 2007 was 45.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall life expectancy in Fiji was 67 years. Since the 1930s the population of Fiji has increased at a rate of 1.1% per year. Since the 1950s, Fiji&#x27;s birth rate has continuously exceeded its death rate. The population is dominated by the 15–64 age segment. The median age of the population was 27.9, and the gender ratio of the total population was 1.03 males per 1 female.

Indigenous Fijians, the native inhabitants of Fiji, are a mixture of Polynesian and Melanesian, resulting from the original migrations to the South Pacific over time. The Indo-Fijian population increased rapidly from the 61,000 people brought from the Indian subcontinent (modern day India, Bangladesh, Pakistan) between 1879 and 1916 to work in the sugarcane fields, many who later would lease/own the sugar cane plantations.

In 1977 &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that ethnic Fijians were a minority of 255,000, in a total population of 600,000 of which fully half were of Indian descent, with the remainder Chinese, European and of mixed ancestry.

The native Fijians live throughout the country, while the Indo-Fijians reside primarily near the urban centres and in the cane-producing areas of the two main islands. Nearly all of the indigenous Fijians are Christian, with some two-thirds being Methodist. The Indo-Fijians, by contrast, have a similar religious mix as India today: some 76.7% percent of the Indo-Fijians are Hindu, with a further almost 16% being Muslim and 6 percent Christian. There are also a few Sikhs.

A national census is supposed to be conducted every ten years, but the census intended for 2006 was postponed until 2007. Finance Minister Ratu Jone Kubuabola announced on 27 October 2005 that the Cabinet had decided that it would not be in the country&#x27;s interest to have a census and a general election in the same year. &quot;Peoples’ focus on the elections could have an impact on their cooperation with census officials&quot;, he said. The Statistics Office supported Kubuabola&#x27;s announcement, saying that public interest in the general election would likely distract people&#x27;s attention from the census, making it problematic to conduct.

According to the 2007 Census of Fiji, the number of Fijians increased from 393,575 to 475,739, while the number of Indians decreased from 338,818 to 313,798. According to government statistics, the latest estimated population of Indigenous Fijians is counted at 511,838, while there are 290,129 Indians and 56,071 Others (January 2012).

<text>The politics of Fiji take place within the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic. Fiji has a multiparty system with the Prime Minister of Fiji as head of government. The executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Parliament of Fiji. The judiciary is mostly independent of the executive and the legislature.

Following the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état, the power was subsumed by the military. Nominal head of state Ratu Josefa Iloilo abolished the Constitution of Fiji and dismissed all Courts, after the Court of Appeal ruled that the post-coup Bainimarama government was illegal. A new Constitution was made known to the public in September 2013, and a general election was held in September 2014, won by Bainimarama&#x27;s FijiFirst Party.

The Economist Intelligence Unit rated Fiji as a &quot;hybrid regime&quot; in 2018.

Fiji&#x27;s Head of State is the President. He is elected by Parliament of Fiji after nomination by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition, for a three-year term. Although his role is largely an honorary one, modelled after that of the British Monarchy, the President has certain &quot;reserve powers&quot; that may be used in the event of a national crisis. In practice, attempts by the President to assert the reserve powers have proved problematic. In 2000, in the midst of a civilian coup d&#x27;État against the elected government, President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara announced on 27 May that he was assuming executive authority, but was evidently forced to resign two days later by the military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama.

The President is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.

Actual executive power is in the hands of the cabinet, presided over by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is elected by Parliament, under the 2013 Constitution of Fiji.

Under the former constitution, which was abrogated at the behest of the Military-backed interim government in 2009, the Prime Minister was formally appointed by the President, but had to be acceptable to a majority of the House of Representatives. In practice, this usually reduced the President&#x27;s role to little more than a formality, with the position automatically going to the leader of the political party or coalition that controlled a majority of seats.

There were times, however, when there was no clear majority in the House of Representatives. The parliamentary election of 1992 was inconclusive, and the position of the largest party, the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei, was further undermined by subsequent defections. On such occasions, the President had to take on the role of an arbitrator. After consulting with all the parliamentary factions, he would appoint as Prime Minister the person he judged to be the most acceptable to the majority in the House of Representatives. If no such person could be found, the President was required to order a new election.

Another situation requiring Presidential intervention arose following the 1999 election. The People&#x27;s Coalition won a landslide victory; with the largest party in the coalition, the Fiji Labour Party, winning a majority in its own right. Some of the smaller parties in the coalition expressed unease at the prospect of Mahendra Chaudhry, the Labour Party leader and an Indo-Fijian, becoming Prime Minister, saying that he would be unacceptable to indigenous Fijian voters that they represented. President Mara, however, persuaded them to accept Chaudhry as Prime Minister.

The cabinet, consisting of around ten to twenty five Ministers, is formally appointed by the President on the nomination of the Prime Minister.

According to the former 1997 constitution, the cabinet was supposed to reflect the political composition of the House of Representatives, with every party holding more than 8 seats in the House entitled to proportionate representation in the cabinet. In practice, this rule was never strictly implemented. In 1999, Chaudhry refused to give Ministerial posts to the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT), saying that its demands were unacceptable. From 2001 to 2004, Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, whose coalition dominated by his Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua had narrowly won the 2001 election, refused to include the Fiji Labour Party in his cabinet, and avoided implementing several subsequent Supreme Court verdicts ordering him to do so by appealing each successive verdict, until the Labour Party announced late in 2004 that it was no longer interested in joining the cabinet. Under the 2013 Constitution, the Cabinet is no longer required to reflect the political composition of Parliament.

The FijiFirst party, led by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, won outright majority in the country’s 51-seat parliament both in 2014 election and narrowly in 2018 election. In October 2021, Tui Macuata Ratu Wiliame Katonivere was elected the new President of Fiji by the parliament.

On 24 December 2022, Sitiveni Rabuka, the head of the People’s Alliance (PAP), became Fiji’s 12th prime minister, succeeding Bainimarama, following the December 2022 general election.

=== Legislative branch ===
Under the 2013 Constitution, Fiji&#x27;s Parliament is unicameral. Its 50 members are elected for four-year terms by Party-list proportional representation, with the entire country voting as a single constituency. To win election to Parliament, a political party (or an independent candidate) must win five percent of the total valid vote nationwide. Fiji&#x27;s system differs from that of many other countries using the party-list system, however, in that voters do not vote for a party, as such, but for an individual candidate. Each voter is allowed to vote for only one candidate. The votes for all candidates on a party ticket are pooled, their aggregate as a percentage of the total valid vote (minus votes cast for parties falling short of the five-percent threshold) determining the number of seats in Parliament to which their party is entitled. The eligible number of candidates from a political party are elected in the order of the number of votes they received individually. In the 2014 elections, for example, the FijiFirst Party polled 59.2 percent of the valid vote. When votes for small parties polling less than the five-percent threshold were excluded, this entitled FijiFirst to 32 of the 50 seats. These were filled by the 32 FijiFirst candidates who polled the highest number of votes as individuals.

Before the adoption of the 2013 Constitution, Fiji&#x27;s Parliament consisted of two houses. The more powerful of the two chambers, the House of Representatives, had 71 members, elected for five-year terms. 25 were elected by universal suffrage. The remaining 46 were reserved for Fiji&#x27;s ethnic communities and were elected from communal electoral rolls: 23 Fijians, 19 Indo-Fijians, 1 Rotuman, and 3 &quot;general electors&quot; (Europeans, Chinese, and other minorities). The House chose a Speaker, who was not allowed to be a present member of the House.

The &quot;upper chamber&quot;, the Senate, was primarily a house of review: it could not initiate legislation, but could amend or reject it. The 32 senators were formally appointed by the President on the nomination of the Great Council of Chiefs (14), the Prime Minister (9), the Leader of the Opposition (8), and the Council of Rotuma (1). Senators as well as Representatives could serve as cabinet Ministers.

When the Parliament was bicameral, the attorney-general, Fiji&#x27;s top legal official who sits in the cabinet, was the only member of Parliament permitted to attend sessions of both chambers. The attorney-general had voting rights only in the chamber they were elected or appointed to and authorised to attend and participate in debates in the other chamber.

=== Judicial branch ===
Fiji maintains an independent judiciary, with judicial power vested in three courts (the High Court, Court of Appeal, and Supreme Court) established by the Constitution, which also makes provision for other courts to be set up by Parliament; Magistrates&#x27; Courts have accordingly been set up. The High Court and the Supreme Court are both presided over by the Chief Justice (currently Kamal Kumar); the Chief Justice is barred, however, from membership of the Court of Appeal, which comprises three judges. The Appeal Court, which did not exist prior to the 1997 Constitution, has the power &quot;to hear and determine appeals&quot; from judgements of the High Court; decisions of this court may be further appealed to the Supreme Court, whose decision is final. The judiciary managed to maintain its independence from political control in the aftermath of the coups of 1987. Following the 2000 coup, however, its integrity was compromised, in the eye of many, when three judges (including Daniel Fatiaki, who later became Chief Justice) advised then-President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara to abrogate the constitution. Mara refused and resigned; a military administration replaced him. Then Chief Justice recognised the military government, triggering widespread disappointment to those who had seen the judiciary as a model of independence. On 15 November 2000, however, the High Court forced the reinstatement of the 1997 Constitution, which had been abrogated in June following the forced resignation of President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara on 29 May.

Following the military coup of 2006, the Military dismissed Chief Justice Daniel Fatiaki and appointed the more pliable Anthony Gates in his place. Following a Court of Appeal decision in 2009 that the Military-backed interim government was illegal, President Ratu Josefa Iloilo abrogated the constitution, dismissed all judges, and reappointed the interim government. Some judges were subsequently reappointed and some were not.

=== Local government ===
There are four administrative divisions (Central, Eastern, Northern and Western), each under the charge of a commissioner appointed by the central government. The divisions are further subdivided into fourteen provinces, each of which has a provincial council. In addition, the island of Rotuma has the status of a &quot;dependency&quot;, and enjoys a degree of internal autonomy, with its own island council.

Ethnic Fijians have their own administration in which councils preside over a hierarchy of provinces, districts, and villages. The councils deal with all matters affecting ethnic Fijians. The 55‑member Great Council of Chiefs &quot;(Bose Levu Vakaturaga&quot; in Fijian) included 3 representatives from each of Fiji&#x27;s 14 provinces and 1 dependency, 3 ex-officio members (the President, Vice-President, and Prime Minister), and 6 government appointees; former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka was a life-member. The Great Council of Chiefs advised the government, and also functioned as an electoral college to appoint the President of the Republic, as well as 14 of the 32 Senators. This prerogative of the Council was delegated to the 14 provincial councils, each choosing one senator. It was a constitutional oddity that even though Fiji became a Republic in 1987, Queen Elizabeth II was by the Great Council of Chiefs as the Tui Viti, the Paramount Chief, until 2012, when the council was disestablished.

Suva, Lautoka, and nine other towns have municipal governments, with city or town councils, each chaired by a mayor. These are responsible for the local affairs of all citizens, and are elected by universal suffrage.

== Contentious issues ==
Most of Fiji&#x27;s political controversies are related to the ethnic fault line that characterises Fijian politics. Fiji&#x27;s former constitution imposed disabilities on a group that constitutes a large part of the population on the pretended basis of race. It has caused an exodus of the Indians, who until the late 1980s formed a slight majority in Fiji.

=== Land tenure ===
One of the main issues that has fuelled the contention over the years is land tenure. Indigenous Fijian communities very closely identify themselves with their land. In 1909 near the peak of the inflow of indentured Indian labourers, the land ownership pattern was frozen and further sales prohibited. Today over 80% of the land is held by indigenous Fijians, under the collective ownership of the traditional Fijian clans. Indo-Fijians produce over 90% of the sugar crop but must lease the land they work from its ethnic Fijian owners instead of being able to buy it outright. The leases have been generally for 10 years, although they are usually renewed for two 10‑year extensions. Many Indo-Fijians argue that these terms do not provide them with adequate security and have pressed for renewable 30‑year leases, while many ethnic Fijians fear that an Indo-Fijian government would erode their control over the land.

The Indo-Fijian parties&#x27; major voting bloc is made up of sugarcane farmers. The farmers&#x27; main tool of influence has been their ability to galvanise widespread boycotts of the sugar industry, thereby crippling the economy.

=== Citizenship and residency issues ===
Multiple citizenship, previously prohibited under the 1997 constitution (abrogated April 2009), has been permitted since the April 2009 Citizenship Decree and established as a right under Section 5(4) of the September 2013 Constitution.

<doc id="54577" wikidata="Q2726945" url="?curid=54577" title="Economy of Fiji">
<text>The economy of Fiji is one of the most developed among the Pacific islands. Nevertheless, Fiji is a developing country endowed with forest, mineral and fish resources. The country has a large agriculture sector heavily based on subsistence agriculture. Sugar exports and the tourism industry are the main sources of foreign exchange. There are also light manufacturing and mining sectors.

Fiji Village quoted Energy Minister Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi on 22 September 2006, who confirmed that the Southern Cross Management Company Limited had applied for a license to drill for petroleum in Fiji&#x27;s waters. The application was later revoked after exploratory reports indicated that Fijian oil reserves were severely overstated. Accepted estimates now range between 500 - 600 million barrels of Brent crude oil, with a total market value of approximately $4.7 billion over 20 years.

Fiji has a population of 905,949 people. The country&#x27;s tallest building is the 30-story Grand Fijian Tower in Suva. Fiji is a member of the WTO.

== Development plan ==

In September 2002, the government announced a 20-year development plan. Among other things, it aimed to give indigenous Fijians a greater stake in the economy. The plan envisages tax-relief to businesses owned or managed by ethnic Fijians, along with greater protection for indigenous land and fishery rights.

A major aim of the Fijian government is to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production. Cattle farming, fishing, and forestry (especially pine trees) are being encouraged to diversify the economy; the leading manufacturing industries involve the processing of primary products. On 14 April 2005, the Cabinet approved Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase&#x27;s proposal to develop a biofuels industry. Under the plan, ethanol is to be developed as a complement to the sugar industry, with the hope of alleviating Fiji&#x27;s dependence on imported fossil fuel such as petrol.

On 15 August, Qarase said that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) had granted assistance to Fiji to develop its biofuels project. Transformation of the Fiji Sugar Corporation into an energy and sugar company would result in a turnover of F$1 billion by 2025, he said, and would cut imports of crude oil, generate export earnings, and provide a source of electricity. Energy could be produced from copra, forest, and agricultural products, as well as sugar. He touted the scheme as necessary for diversifying and strengthening the sugar industry for its own survival, as well as for the national economy. He said that the government of India had loaned F$86 million for upgrading of Fiji&#x27;s sugar mills, which would be completed in time for the 2007-2008 crushing season.

On 28 December 2005, John Teiwa of the Coconut Industry Development Authority announced that a 20-year plan for the coconut industry would be launched in 2006. Financing from international investors, including the government of India, would be sought to develop processing of virgin and extra virgin coconut oil, with a view to venturing into foreign health markets. The government expected an annual profit of F$120 million from the venture, Fiji Village reported. Trials for the generation of fuel from coconut oil were also in progress, Teiwa said.

==Sectors==
===Agriculture and forestry===
Fiji has a large subsistence agriculture sector, which accounts for 18% of gross domestic product, although it employed some 70% of the workforce as of 2001. Sugarcane is the main agricultural product grown in Fiji. Other agricultural products grown in Fiji include coconuts, copra, ginger, cassava, bananas, rice, sweet potatoes, taro, pickles, kava, pineapples, and plantains. Livestock such as cattle, pigs, and goats are also reared for meat. Fishing is important to the economy as well, with fish products accounting for almost one-tenth of revenue from exports in the early 21st century. Lumber is another major industry, with timber being Fiji&#x27;s third-largest export commodity.

In 2018 Fiji produced:

* 1.3 million tons of sugarcane
* 72 thousand tons of cassava
* 49 thousand tons of taro
* 22 thousand tons of coconut
* 21 thousand tons of vegetable
* 10 thousand tons of ginger
* 8 thousand tons of sweet potato
* 7 thousand tons of rice
* 6 thousand tons of pineapple
* 5 thousand tons of plantain

In 2019 Fiji produced 41,892 tons of meat.

===Manufacturing===
Sugarcane processing makes up a significant portion of industrial activity. Fiji also has successful garment manufacturing and mineral water bottling industries. Other manufacturing activities include boat building, particularly the construction of fishing boats and pleasure craft, cement making, brewing, and paint manufacturing. Fiji is also a manufacturer and net exporter of wood products such as pine chips, sawnwood and wood-based panels.

===Mining===
Gold, silver, and copper are mined in Fiji.

===Tourism===
Tourism has expanded rapidly since the early 1980s and is the leading economic activity in the islands accounting for 24.4% of GDP in 2019. Excluding cruise ship passengers, more than 960,000 people visited Fiji in 2019. An increase of over 500,000 since 1999 when 409,000 tourists visited.

In 1999 a quarter of tourists came from Australia, with large contingents also coming from New Zealand, Japan, the United States and United Kingdom. Over 62,000 of the tourists were American, a number that had steadily increased since the start of regularly scheduled non-stop air service from Los Angeles. Tourism earned more than $300 million in foreign exchange for Fiji in 1998, an amount exceeding the revenue from its two largest goods exports (sugar and garments).

The effects of the Asian financial crisis led to a sharp drop in the number of Asian tourists visiting Fiji in 1997 and 1998, which contributed to a substantial drop in gross domestic product. Positive growth returned in 1999, however, aided by a 20% devaluation of the Fijian dollar. 2005 was a record year for the tourism sector, with 9% growth according to Viliame Gavoka, Chief Executive of the Fiji Visitors Bureau.

===High-tech===
Fiji has a high-tech industry with a number of software development companies present in the country. In 2021, Fiji&#x27;s high-tech exports were worth about $1.95 million.

== Trade ==

Fiji runs a persistently large trade deficit. Imports in 1998 accounted for US$721 million, and exports for US$510 million, resulting in a US$116 million deficit. Tourism revenue yields services surplus, however, which keeps the current account of its balance of payments roughly in balance ($13 million in 1998). Australia accounts for between 35% and 45% of Fiji&#x27;s trade, with New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan varying year-by-year between 5% and 15% each.

Foodstuffs, machinery, mineral fuels, beverages, tobacco, and manufactured goods are the principal imports. The two largest exports are sugar and garments, which each accounted for approximately one-quarter of export revenue in 1998 (roughly $122 million each). The sugar industry suffered in 1997 due to low world prices and rent disputes between farmers and landowners, and again in 1998 from drought, but recovered in 1999.

The Fijian garment industry has developed rapidly since the introduction of tax exemptions in 1988. The industry&#x27;s output has increased nearly tenfold since that time. Fish, lumber, molasses, coconut oil and ginger are also important exports, although the last two are in decline. Forestry became important as an export trade in the mid-1980s, when the pine plantations planted in the 1950s and 1960s began to mature. They sell much fish.

Australia&#x27;s Trade Commissioner Ross Bray revealed on 26 January 2006 that Fiji&#x27;s exports to Australia are achieving an annual growth rate of 5%. More than 31,000 Australian companies were trading in the Pacific, half of them in Fiji, Bray said. Fiji is progressing very rapidly.

== Investment ==

The government&#x27;s policy of awarding tax concessions to large multinational companies investing in Fiji has not proved universally popular. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has criticized it, saying that the concessions have been abused and have not generated long-term investment. An ADB report in 2005 accused foreign entrepreneurs of leaving as soon as their concessions expired, and alleged that administration of the concessions encouraged corruption and bribery.

The leader of the Fiji Labour Party Mahendra Chaudhry echoed the view of the ADB on 31 December 2005, saying that foreign companies repatriated much of the profit made in Fiji, rather than investing it locally, while taking advantage of the infrastructure funded by Fijian taxpayers without paying any taxes themselves. Such policy discriminated against local businesses, he claimed.

== Economic problems ==

Fiji&#x27;s economic difficulties have been compounded by the effects of four coups since the 1980s.

=== Emigration ===

Since 1987, when the country was destabilized by two military coups, Fiji has suffered a very high rate of emigration, particularly of skilled and professional personnel. More than 70,000 people left the country in the aftermath of the coups, majority of whom were Indo-Fijians. With the continuing expiration of land leases and ongoing instability in the aftermath of another coup in 2000, a further outflow of skilled workers has taken place.

A report in 2004 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, published on 29 June 2005, found that 61% of Fiji&#x27;s skilled workers have either emigrated or gone abroad as guestworkers. Fiji&#x27;s loss of skilled workers was the world&#x27;s fourth highest, behind Guyana, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago. Fiji&#x27;s Bureau of Statistics recorded 3595 workers as having left the country between January and August 2004. Of these, 414 held professional or technical jobs, 263 were in administrative or managerial positions, and were clerks, supervisors, or related workers, and 118 were sales workers. 

Fiji&#x27;s economy is increasingly reliant on remittances from citizens working overseas. Personal remittances now run to more than F$200 million a year, earning more than traditional sectors like sugar and garment manufacturing. Recruitment of Fijians by foreign private military companies is a growing source of revenue. By mid-2005, there were over 1,000 Fijians working in Iraq and Kuwait as soldiers, security guards, drivers and labourers. In addition in 2006 there were more than 2,000 Fijian soldiers in the British Army, and in 2004 the British defence ministry even sent recruiting teams to Fiji to do initial fitness and aptitude tests, cutting the costs of selection for poor Fijian villagers who could not afford to fly to London to sign up.

=== Property laws and investment problems ===

Low investment has been a long-term problem in Fiji, and property rights are sometimes thought to be part of this problem because, by law, five sixths of the land is owned communally by indigenous Fijians and may only be leased, not purchased outright. However, the leasehold system is often misunderstood.

Leasehold tenure has not been a problem for the property sector. Houses all over Fiji on communally owned land are on 99-year leases, which have proved satisfactory as a basis for house ownership. Hotels also enjoy 99-year leases. The prestigious Denarau development involving major hotels and resorts and luxury properties is situated on communally owned land. It delivers significant income to native owners and secure title to developers and their customers.

In agricultural sector, there have been problems even though agricultural leases are mandated at 30 years, following the extension by legislation (the Agricultural Landlord and Tenant Act or ALTA) of all ten-year leases to thirty years in 1977. The problem experienced in agriculture is the non-renewal leases as landowners have been unhappy with the provisions in the ALTA for indexing of rents to cope with inflation. That is an ongoing problem which calls for urgent attention.

=== Natural disasters ===

Drought in 1998 further damaged the sugar industry, but its recovery in 1999 contributed to robust GDP growth. Further damage to the economy (estimated at US$30 million) was wrought by a cyclone that hit the northern island of Vanua Levu in January 2003. Apart from the economic devastation, there were food shortages and outbreaks of disease due to the pollution of the water supply.

=== Tourism woes ===

The aftermath of the political turmoil in 2000 resulted in a 10-percent shrinkage in the economy, as investor confidence plummeted and tourist numbers dropped more than 15% from 544,000 visitors in 1999 to under 434,000 by the end of 2000. An estimated 7500 jobs were lost. There has been a gradual recovery since 2001, when the 1997 constitution was restored and free elections held.

The possibility of a return to a racially discriminatory constitution led to fears that Fiji might forfeit its preferential arrangements with the European Union for its sugar exports, and with Australia for its clothing industry, but those fears have largely (but not entirely) subsided.

=== Homelessness ===

In June 2003, a survey revealed a disturbingly high percentage of squatters, about a tenth of Fijian citizens. 82,350 individuals in 13,725 households were estimated to live in 182 squatter settlements, with Suva and Nausori being the worst-affected areas. The number of squatter settlements had increased 14% since January 2001, and 73% since 1996. Urban migration, unemployment, the expiry of land leases, and the breakdown of nuclear and extended families were among the factors blamed for the trend. The report projected the population of squatters to grow to 90,000 in the Suva-Nausori corridor by 2006, putting increasing strain on supplies of water, electricity, sewage, and road services. On 14 September, Prime Minister Qarase said that the squatter problem had become so serious that the government was looking abroad for funding.

=== Human Development Index ===

On 11 September 2005, the publication of the United Nations Human Development Index downgraded Fiji from 81st in 2004 to 92nd in 2005, behind Pacific neighbours Tonga and Samoa. Incomes had improved, the report said, with gross domestic product rising from F$5440 to F$5880, but other aspects of the quality of life enjoyed by Fiji Islanders had deteriorated. Life expectancy had declined from 72.9 in 2000 to 69.6 in 2004 and 67.8 in 2005, while literacy remained unchanged at 93%.

Joji Kotobalavu, the chief executive of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, branded the report &quot;a joke.&quot; His dismissal drew strong reaction from Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry, who said that whereas Kotobalavu was paid to be the Prime Minister&#x27;s spin doctor, the HDI report was put together by professionals who had no hidden agendas, and should therefore be taken very seriously.

Since 2005, the Human Development Index of Fiji has steadily risen from a reading of 0.687 to 0.743, just above the global median for all countries of 0.74. As of 2020 Fiji ranked 90th out of 183 countries on the Human Development Index.

The Fiji Rural Electrification Policy 1993 has been used by the Fiji Department of Energy in the implementation of rural electrification projects which includes diesel schemes for villages, micro hydro projects, house wiring, biofuel projects, solar home systems and grid extension. Villages and communities have been paying 10% of the total project costs and government pays 90%. In 2010, government reduced the contribution from communities to 5% and this has increased the number of applicants.

=== Agriculture ===

<text>RC Cola (short for Royal Crown Cola) is a cola-flavored carbonated beverage owned in the United States by Keurig Dr Pepper and internationally by RC Global Beverages, Inc.

==History==
In 1901, the Cole-Hampton-Hatcher Grocery Store was established in Columbus, Georgia. In 1903, the Hatcher family took sole ownership and the name was changed to the Hatcher Grocery Store. The grocery store was located at what was 22 West 10th Street. Today&#x27;s address (after house number changes) is 15 West 10th Street. At the same time, the popularity of bottled soft drinks rose rapidly, and grocery store owners wished to maximize their profit. As a grocery wholesaler, Claud A. Hatcher purchased a large volume of Coca-Cola syrup from the local company salesman, Columbus Roberts. Hatcher felt that the company deserved a special reduced price for the syrup since it purchased such large volumes. Roberts would not budge on the cost, and a bitter conflict between the two erupted. Hatcher told Roberts he would win the battle by never purchasing any more Coca-Cola, and was determined to develop his own soft drink formula. He started developing products in the basement of the store with a recipe for ginger ale.

Hatcher launched the Union Bottling Works in his family&#x27;s grocery store. The first product in the Royal Crown line was Royal Crown Ginger Ale in 1905, followed by Royal Crown Strawberry, and Royal Crown Root Beer. In 1907, cherry-flavored Chero-Cola was introduced. The company was later renamed Chero-Cola in 1910. In 1924, its new fruit-flavored beverage, Nehi was introduced. This led to the company&#x27;s renaming in 1925 to Nehi, Inc. Following its founder, Claud A. Hatcher&#x27;s death in 1933, and Chero-Cola being reformulated in 1934 by chemist Rufus Kamm, the company reintroduced the &quot;Royal Crown&quot; to launch Royal Crown Cola. The company itself went on to change its name from Nehi, Inc. to Royal Crown Cola Company in 1951.

In the 1950s, Royal Crown Cola and Moon Pies were a popular &quot;working man&#x27;s lunch&quot; in the American South. In 1954, Royal Crown was the first company to sell soft drinks in a can, and later the first company to sell soft drinks in an aluminum can. In 1962, the company introduced the first diet cola, Diet Rite.

During the 1970s, Royal Crown Cola Company developed their international presence, including countries in Asia and Europe.

In 1976, the Raffel family sold Arby&#x27;s to the Royal Crown Cola Company for $18 million.

Caffeine- and sugar-free cola RC 100 was launched in 1980.

In 1984, Cherry RC, Diet RC and Diet Rite flavors were introduced. That year, RC Cola accounted for approximately 4–5% of soft drink sales in the United States, behind Coke, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, and 7 Up. 

In 1995, Royal Crown Draft Cola was released as the first premium draft cola. It was made with pure cane sugar as a sweetener (instead of high fructose corn syrup), the finest Kola nuts, all-natural flavors and pure filtered water. Offered only in 12-ounce bottles, it was discontinued, due largely to the inability of the RC bottling network to get distribution for the product in single-drink channels, and it was discontinued with the exceptions of Australia, New Zealand, and France. It was later available only in New Zealand, parts of Australia, Thailand, and Tajikistan. The company also released Cherry RC, a cherry-flavored version of the RC soft drink to compete with Cherry Coke and Wild Cherry Pepsi.

==Ownership changes==

In 1993, Royal Crown Cola Company was purchased by Triarc Companies, Inc, adding approximately $25 million a year to the marketing budget.

In September 2000, Royal Crown was acquired by Cadbury Schweppes (which owned Dr Pepper) through its acquisition of Triarc&#x27;s beverages business (which also included Snapple). Cadbury Schweppes&#x27; US-based beverage business (including RC) was spun off as &quot;Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPSG)&quot; in 2008. DPSG merged with Keurig Green Mountain in 2018 as Keurig Dr Pepper, the current owners of the RC Cola brand.

In 2001, all non-US businesses were sold to Cott Beverages of Canada and operated as Royal Crown Cola International. In 2021, Cott sold Royal Crown Cola International to Refresco for US$50 million. Simultaneously, Refresco sold to Royal Crown Cola International to RC Global Beverages Inc.

In September 2022, Philippine-based Macay Holdings announced it will acquire 100% of RC Global Beverages Inc., subject to the finalization of a share purchase agreement and other closing conditions. The transaction was completed in January 17, 2023 for approximately $47 million, comprising a $21.4 million cash payment for equity and the assumption of approximately $26 million of obligations.

==Advertising campaigns==


The RC Cola brand has been marketed through many campaigns. In the 1930s, Alex Osborn, with BBDO, made an ad campaign, including the slogan &quot;The season&#x27;s best.&quot;

In 1940, a publicity campaign was run, which saw Hollywood celebrities, next to the slogan &quot;Best By Taste Test&quot;. Actress Lizabeth Scott as the face, next to the slogan &quot;RC tastes best, says Lizabeth Scott&quot;.

In 1966, Royal Crown Cola collaborated with Jim Henson on an ad campaign for Royal Crown Cola which featured two birds called Sour Bird (performed by Jim Henson) and Nutty Bird (performed by Henson and assisted by Frank Oz) to promote the drinks. Nutty Bird would promote Royal Crown Cola by touting its benefits. The puppet for Nutty Bird was designed by Jim Henson and built by Don Sahlin. Sour Bird appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; with the Rock and Roll Monster.

Nancy Sinatra was featured in two Royal Crown Cola commercials in her one-hour TV special, &quot;Movin&#x27; With Nancy&quot;, which featured various singers and David Winters choreography in December 1967. She sang, &quot;It&#x27;s a mad, mad, mad Cola...RC the one with the mad, mad taste!...RC!&quot; The company was the official sponsor of New York Mets on and off at times from the team&#x27;s inception in 1962 until the early 1990s. A television commercial in the New York area featured Tom Seaver, New York Mets pitcher, and his wife, Nancy, dancing on top of a dugout at Shea Stadium and singing the tune from the Sinatra campaign. 

RC sponsored two Porsche 917/10 Can-Am race cars during the 1972–73 season. In the mid-1970s, Royal Crown ran the &quot;Me &amp; My RC&quot; advertisements. Others featured people in scenic outdoor locations. Louise Mandrell sang the jingle &quot;Me and my RC / Me and my RC /&#x27;Cause what&#x27;s good enough / For other folks / Ain&#x27;t good enough for Me and My RC...&quot; 

RC was introduced to Israel in 1995 with the slogan &quot;RC: Just like in America!&quot; During the Cola Wars of the 1980s, RC used the &#x27;Decide for yourself&#x27; campaign and would remind people &#x27;There&#x27;s more to your life than Coke and Pepsi.&quot;

In the Philippines, RC Cola released advertisements with artists popular in the country. In 2009, these had Maja Salvador and Kim Bum as celebrity endorsers. The Philippine marketing of the brand also painted the front of sari-sari stores with slogans like &quot;RC ng (insert municipality/city)&quot; (RC of my [town/city]). In 2019, the advertisements tapped Joshua Garcia to be the year&#x27;s celebrity endorser and launched the &quot;RC ng Bayan&quot; campaign. In 2020, RC Cola had a campaign &quot;Basta&quot;, which featured a boy confronting his mother if he is adopted due to glasses embedded on his back. This campaign led to numerous awards such as a bronze award for Film at the Cannes Lion 2021, a bronze award at the 2021 Asia Pacific Effie Awards for the Youth Marketing category, a silver award at the 2022 Asia Pacific Effie Awards for the Beverages, Non-Alcohol category and the Short Video Marketing category, and a bronze award for Film at the 2022 Clio Awards.

Andretti Autosport driver Marco Andretti had RC Cola as his primary sponsor during the 2012 and 2013 IndyCar Series.

In 2022, RC Cola launched its WHY NOT? campaign, featuring three adults who upon taking a sip of RC Cola, would be transported to a world filled with endless imagination.

<text>Subway IP LLC, trading as Subway, is an American multinational fast food restaurant franchise that specializes in submarine sandwiches (subs) and wraps. It was founded by Fred DeLuca and financed by Peter Buck in 1965 as Pete&#x27;s Super Submarines in Bridgeport, Connecticut. After several name changes, it was renamed Subway in 1972, and a franchise operation began in 1974 with a second restaurant in Wallingford, Connecticut.

The longtime Subway slogan, &quot;Eat Fresh&quot;, is intended to indicate that their toppings are indeed fresh. It was the fastest-growing franchise in the world in 2015 and, as of September 2023, has over 68,000 locations in more than 102 countries and territories. More than half its locations (21,796 or 61.1%) are in the United States. It is the largest single-brand restaurant chain and the largest restaurant operator in the world. Its international headquarters are in Shelton, Connecticut.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===

In 1965, Fred DeLuca borrowed $1,000 from his friend Peter Buck to start &quot;Pete&#x27;s Drive-In: Super Submarines&quot; at 3851 Main Street in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and in the following year, they formed Doctor&#x27;s Associates Inc. to oversee operations of the restaurants as the franchise expanded. The holding company derives its name from DeLuca&#x27;s goal to earn enough from the business to pay tuition for medical school, as well as Buck&#x27;s having a doctorate in physics. In 1968, the sandwich shop was renamed Subway. In 1976, a franchise operation began with a restaurant in Wallingford, Connecticut.

The first Subway on the West Coast was opened in Fresno, California, in 1978. The first Subway outside of North America opened in Bahrain in December 1984. The first Subway in Canada opened in St. John&#x27;s in 1986. The first Subway in the United Kingdom opened in Brighton in 1996.

In 1989, Subway acquired Cajun Joe&#x27;s, a Boston, Massachusetts-based chain which sold fried chicken and Cajun cuisine. The venture proved unsuccessful, and most were closed by the end of the 1990s.

===Development since the 2000s===
In 2004, Subway began opening stores in Walmart supercenters, and surpassed the number of McDonald&#x27;s locations inside U.S. Walmart stores in 2007. Since 2007, Subway has consistently ranked in the &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; Franchise 500. In 2015, it ranked third on the &quot;Top Global Franchises&quot; list, and first as the &quot;Fastest Growing Franchise.&quot; At the end of 2010, Subway became the largest fast food chain worldwide– with 33,749 restaurants, that is 1,012 more than McDonald&#x27;s.

In January 2015, Suzanne Greco became president and CEO. Her brother Fred DeLuca, the company&#x27;s first CEO, had been ill for two years and died of leukemia in September 2015. In 2016, Subway closed hundreds of restaurants in the U.S., experiencing a net loss in locations for the first time. However, with 26,744 locations, it remained the most ubiquitous restaurant chain in the U.S. (with McDonald&#x27;s in the #2 spot).

In July 2017, Subway unveiled redesigned restaurants, dubbed &#x27;Fresh Forward&#x27;, with new company branding. The company installed self-order kiosks, USB charging ports at tables, and added new menu items.

In 2017, Subway closed more than 800 U.S. locations. In April 2018, it announced it would close about 500 more that year. According to Abha Bhattarai of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, this was a result of three consecutive years of falling profits and a 25 percent reduction in foot traffic in Subway stores since 2012. Franchisees also complained that the company&#x27;s deep promotions further ate away at profits. In January 2018, Subway invested $25 million in a re-branding campaign targeting young consumers to revitalize its image and boost sales. In 2019, John Chidsey joined Subway as the company&#x27;s first CEO who was not a founding family member. He focused on improving established U.S. locations rather than building new restaurants. In December 2020, Subway partnered with ezCater to offer a new online catering platform.

In 2023, the family announced that they were in the process of selling the company to private ownership. The company enlisted the help of JP Morgan with the sale. The price of the company was reported to be around $10 billion. Several potential buyers made offers for the company. These included the asset management division of investment bank Goldman Sachs, TDR Capital, and TPG Inc. On August 24, Subway announced that Roark Capital would purchase the company for $9.6 billion. The deal&#x27;s reported value would make it the third-biggest US acquisition in restaurant history, behind Burger King&#x27;s 2014 acquisition of Tim Hortons for $11.4 billion and Inspire Brands&#x27; purchase of Dunkin&#x27; Brands in 2020 for $11.3 billion.

In November 2023, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was looking into investigating the deal as it would possibly give Roark a monopoly in the sandwich shop industry via the firm&#x27;s existing ownership of Subway&#x27;s competitors McAllister&#x27;s Deli &amp; Jimmy John&#x27;s. On April 30, 2024, Roark officially acquired Subway after the FTC determined that Roark did not have an unfair advantage.

On March 19, 2024, Subway signed a 10-year deal with PepsiCo that began on January 1, 2025, ending the restaurant chain&#x27;s partnership with The Coca-Cola Company that was first signed in 2003, went into effect the following year in 2004, and the Coke switchover was completed by 2005. Subway&#x27;s international locations had already gone back to serving Pepsi products between 2015 and 2018. Pepsi previously had a deal with them when they were founded that lasted until the Coca-Cola switchover.

==Corporate affairs==


===Ownership===
, Subway was owned by the private equity group Roark Capital. Prior to that, Subway had been owned by its founding families for six decades. In 2019, John Chidsey joined Subway as the first chief executive officer outside of the DeLuca family.

===Structure===
As of 2017, the Subway Group of companies was organized as follows:
*Subway IP Inc. is the owner of the intellectual property for the restaurant system.
*Franchise World Headquarters, LLC leads franchising operations. FWH Technologies, LLC owns and licenses Subway&#x27;s point of sale software.
*Franchisors include Doctor&#x27;s Associates Inc. in the U.S.; Subway International B.V.; Subway Franchise Systems of Canada, Ltd.; etc.
*Advertising affiliates include Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust, Ltd.; Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust, B.V.; Subway Franchisee Canadian Advertising Trust; etc.
*IPC Europe (Independent Purchasing Company Europe Limited), manager of the Subway franchisees and the Subcard loyalty scheme in European countries.

===Headquarters===
Subway&#x27;s international headquarters are in Shelton, Connecticut. The company is in the Enterprise Corporate Park, where it takes of space. This space takes up three floors. This facility began operations in 2023. The company stated that it chose Shelton due to proximity to various locations in Connecticut as well as proximity to points of interest.

Previously the headquarters were in Milford, Connecticut, taking up three land portions. In 2024 the former buildings were razed.

There are five regional centers supporting the company&#x27;s international operations. The regional offices for European franchises are located in Amsterdam (Netherlands); the Australian and New Zealand locations are supported from Brisbane (Australia); the Asian locations are supported from offices in Beirut (Lebanon) and Singapore; and the Latin American support center is in Miami (US).

===Franchising===
The startup cost of owning a Subway franchise is significantly lower than competitors, beginning at around $200,000 to $500,000. However, Subway franchisees also pay some of the highest percentages of profits (around 12.5%) back to Subway compared to competitors.

==Locations==

As of February 2023, Subway had approximately 37,000 locations in more than 100 countries, all independently owned and operated by a network of franchisees. Subway has the highest concentration of locations in North America with more than 20,000 in the United States, 2,881 in Canada, and 758 in Mexico, as of 2019. This was almost as many U.S. locations as McDonald&#x27;s and Starbucks combined, as of 2018. Outside North America, the countries with the most locations are Australia (1,215), Brazil (1,643), and the United Kingdom (2,195), as of 2019.

==Products==
===Overview===
Subway&#x27;s core product is the submarine sandwich (or &quot;sub&quot;). It also sells wraps, salad, paninis, and baked goods (including cookies, doughnuts, and muffins). Subway also sells breakfast sandwiches, English muffins, and flatbread. In 2006, &quot;personal pizzas&quot; debuted in some US markets. These are made to order (like the subs) and heated for 85 seconds. Breakfast and pizza items are only available in select locations. In November 2009, Subway signed a deal to serve exclusively Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee coffee as part of its breakfast menu in the US.

Subway&#x27;s best-selling sandwich, the B.M.T. (short for &quot;Biggest, Meatiest, Tastiest&quot;), contains pepperoni, salami and ham. It was introduced as a reference to Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit, connecting to the &quot;subway&quot; name.

In April 2017, Subway announced the addition of paninis to its menu. Chipotle Steak &amp; Cheese, Triple Cheese, Chicken Cordon Bleu, and Italian B.M.T. Melt were the four variations announced. In September 2018, Subway debuted the Chipotle Cheesesteak sandwich for a limited time. Regional testing of a crispy chicken sandwich also began taking place in Arkansas. In January 2024, Subway debuted Sidekicks, a new range of footlong baked goods in partnership with Cinnabon and Auntie Anne&#x27;s.

====SubDog====
Subway&#x27;s SubDog is an American-style hotdog, topped with mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce and a limited-edition tangy mustard, in which started as an April Fool&#x27;s joke in 2022 but due to popular demand Subway brought the SubDog to reality as a limited-time offer. Subway announced the return of the SubDog in Australia for a limited time in 2024 between 2 September to 6 October.

===Regional variations===
Subway&#x27;s menu varies between countries, most significantly where religious requirements relate to the meats served.

In 2006, the first kosher Subway restaurant in the United States opened in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio in the Mandel Jewish Community Center of Cleveland. Former Subway spokesman Jared Fogle attended the opening. A press release stated, &quot;With slight modifications, such as no pork-based products, and the use of soy-based cheese product, the menu is virtually identical to that of any other Subway restaurant.&quot; Other openings soon followed, briefly making Subway one of the largest U.S. kosher restaurant chains. At their peak, twelve kosher Subway locations were open in the U.S., including Kansas City and 5 in New York. As of 2023, only one kosher Subway remains, in Miami, FL. Franchisees who failed noted a lack of support from the parent location in advertising, higher costs of kosher food and supervision, the inability to remain open on Saturdays, and that customers who do not keep kosher prefer the original menu and prices.

Subway opened its first restaurant in India in 2001 in New Delhi. In deference to Hindu beliefs, Subway restaurants in India do not serve beef products; on the other hand, the country&#x27;s large number of vegetarians induced Subway&#x27;s Indian outlets to offer a much-extended range of vegetarian options. As of January 2017, there were 591 Subway restaurants in 68 Indian cities. On September 4, 2012, Subway opened its first all-vegetarian outlet on the campus of Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Jalandhar, Punjab. On March 6, 2013, Subway opened its second all-vegetarian outlet also offering Jain food in Paldi, Ahmedabad.

===Nutritional content===
In 2011, Subway introduced gluten-free bread and brownies to some locations in Texas. It also cut the salt content of its sandwiches by 15 percent in 2011.

==Marketing==
Subway is the second-biggest fast food advertiser in the United States, behind only McDonald&#x27;s. It spent US$516,000,000 on measurable advertising in 2011.

Subway used the advertising slogan &quot;Eat Fresh&quot; and focused on how its sandwiches were made from freshly baked bread and fresh ingredients, in front of customers to their exact specifications, by employees which Subway called &quot;Subway Sandwich Artists&quot;.

In 2005, Subway scrapped its &quot;Sub Club&quot; stamp promotion, citing a growing number of counterfeit stamps due to online auction sites and the increasing availability of high-quality printers.

In November 2007, Subway&#x27;s US commercials featured the cartoon character Peter Griffin (from FOX&#x27;s &quot;Family Guy&quot;) promoting its new Subway Feast sandwich.

Subway ran a product placement campaign in the US TV series &quot;Chuck&quot; since its first season. As ratings dwindled in the second season, a campaign to &quot;save Chuck&quot; was launched for fans, encouraging them to purchase a footlong sub from Subway on April 27, 2009, the date of the season finale. Tony Pace, Subway&#x27;s marketing officer, called it the best product placement the restaurant chain has done &quot;in several years.&quot;

To celebrate National Sandwich Day on November 3, 2015, Subway offered a Buy One sandwich, Give One sandwich free promotion.

Most Subway locations feature a promotion named &quot;Sub of the Day&quot; where a different submarine sandwich is featured each day of the week at a discounted price. In the past they had a monthly promotion that featured a specialty sub sandwich at a discounted price for the entire month.

===Jared Fogle===

Beginning in January 2000, Jared Fogle was a national spokesman for the company in the US, giving talks on healthy living and appearing in advertisements. Fogle first came to attention in his native Indiana by claiming that he lost over in part by eating at Subway. After 2008, he was featured less often as the company marketed with more emphasis on its &quot;5 dollar footlong&quot; campaign. Subway attributed between one-third and one-half of its growth from 1998 to 2011 to Fogle, the equivalent of a tripling in size. Subway ended its relationship with Fogle in 2015 after he was charged with possession of child pornography and illicit sexual conduct with a minor. After pleading guilty in August 2015, he was sentenced to more than 15 years in federal prison three months later.

In December 2015, following the removal of Fogle from its marketing, Subway introduced a new marketing campaign, &quot;Founded on Fresh&quot;. The campaign focuses on Subway&#x27;s establishment and early history and features Fred DeLuca, as played by his son, Jonathan. The new campaign downplays the use of jingles and celebrity endorsements (besides &quot;targeted&quot; sports marketing) in favor of focusing on the qualities of its products and specific products. Chief advertising officer Chris Carroll explained that the focus on fat, calories, and weight loss were &quot;what fresh used to be&quot; and that the new campaign would focus more on the sourcing of Subway&#x27;s ingredients, such as its phase-out of antibiotic-treated meat. Carroll also explained that the new strategy was being developed prior to the controversy involving Fogle.

===$5 footlongs===
In 2008, Subway began to offer all its regular submarine sandwiches (excluding the premium and double-meat varieties) for five dollars (equivalent to $ in ), in the continental United States and Canada, as a &quot;limited time only&quot; promotion. &quot;Five Dollar Footlongs&quot; quickly became the company&#x27;s most successful promotion ever. Upon the initial promotion&#x27;s completion, customer response prompted Subway to create a &quot;$5 Footlong Everyday Value Menu&quot; that offered some footlong sandwiches for $5. Since 2011, there has been a monthly rotating $5 footlong. In October 2011, a similar promotion was launched in the United Kingdom. Customers can buy one of nine subs and any drink for £3 (for a sub) or £5 (for a footlong).

In 2012, San Francisco restaurants discontinued the five-dollar footlong promotion due to the higher cost of doing business in the city. From June 2014 to the end of that year, some Subway locations began discontinuing the $5 promotion. On November 1, 2014, Subway discontinued the five-dollar footlong promotion, replacing it with the Simple $6 Menu which included a six-inch select with a drink and a choice of cookies or chips.

In February 2016, Subway announced that all classic footlongs would be priced at $6 each. In January 2018, the $5 promotion returned with a $4.99 footlong menu of five subs at participating locations. In September 2018, Subway announced that it would discontinue the $5 footlong promotion to boost franchise profits.

===Italian Hero===
In early 2017, Subway introduced its Italian Hero and advertised it with a campaign describing it as an authentic Italian(-American) sandwich. Created by their national creative agency MMB, two comedic spots feature Italian-American characters on and around the stoop of a tenement building, one including a cameo by sportscaster Dick Vitale. Another ad features Food Network&#x27;s Jeff Mauro, the &quot;Sandwich King&quot;, who is also Italian-American, discussing the nature and role of the different Italian meats and other ingredients.

===&quot;Refresh&quot;===
In July 2021, Subway debuted its &quot;Refresh&quot; campaign featuring: Tom Brady, Stephen Curry, Serena Williams, and Megan Rapinoe. Subway franchisees requested Rapinoe be pulled from the ads following the 2020 Olympics, claiming her testimonial caused sales to dip and harmed the stores&#x27; reputation.

==Sponsorships==
Subway has sponsored a number of sports events, particularly NASCAR races, including the Subway 300 (2001), Subway 400 (2002–2004), Subway 500 (2003–2007), Subway Fresh 500 (2005–2013) and the Subway Firecracker 250 (2009–2016). Subway sponsored the Subway Super Series ice hockey tournament from 2009 to 2014. In September 2022, Subway secured a three-year partnership deal with Football Australia for the naming rights of the men&#x27;s national football teams as the Subway Socceroos, Subway Olyroos, Subway Young Socceroos, and Subway Joeys. The deal also includes Subway becoming the official partner of the Matildas and the Australia Cup.

==Animal welfare==
In December 2015, Subway released a commitment to move to a 100% cage-free egg supply chain in North America by 2025.

In April 2017, Subway released a chicken welfare policy that states that by 2024 or sooner, 100% of its U.S. chicken products will be produced in alignment with Global Animal Partnership (GAP) standards for higher welfare breeds, enhanced living environments (including lighting, litter, and enrichment), increased activity levels and optimized stocking density, and improved slaughter methods. To ensure compliance, Subway&#x27;s chicken suppliers will be third-party audited with updates communicated annually.

The policy announcement followed a nationwide campaign led by high school animal activist Lia Hyman in coordination with the animal protection NGO The Humane League. On April 20, 2017, Hyman and a group of activists traveled to Subway&#x27;s global headquarters in Connecticut to deliver more than 53,000 signatures from campaign supporters and held a demonstration outside the building after they were denied entry.

==Controversies==
===Hepatitis A contamination===
In September 1999, at least 32 customers in Seattle contracted hepatitis A after eating food contaminated with the virus at two Subway outlets. The virus, which is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with infected feces, infects the liver causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever. Subsequent investigations found that staff failed to adhere to thorough hand washing and the use of plastic gloves during food preparation. A class-action lawsuit on behalf of 31 victims was resolved for $1.6 million. The most seriously affected victim—a 6-year-old boy—suffered acute liver failure and required a liver transplant. He was awarded $10 million in an out-of-court settlement in 2001. A previous outbreak of hepatitis A in 1996 had also involved a Subway outlet in Seattle, although no legal action had resulted.

In April 2015, the Arkansas Department of Health issued a warning to the public that customers who had eaten at the Subway outlet in Morrilton, Arkansas, may have been exposed to infection after an employee tested positive for the virus.

===Sandwich size===
On February 2, 2007, KNXV-TV (with the help of the Arizona Department of Weights and Measures) reported that three of Subway&#x27;s &quot;Giant Sub&quot; sandwiches, normally each long, were actually only long. Under Arizona regulations, objects cannot be more than 3% shorter than their advertised length; a &quot;three-foot&quot; sub must be at least long. The report also showed the boxes designed to store these sandwiches were in length; shorter than the maximum allowable variance. In response to the report, Subway said it was reevaluating its advertising, training, and packaging materials with regard to the specific or implied length of Giant Subs and was advising its franchisees to only discuss with customers the approximate number of expected servings and not a specific length of measurement.

In January 2013, an Australian teen, Matt Corby, complained on Facebook that Subway&#x27;s &quot;footlong&quot; sandwich was only long, rather than . Subway responded by saying, &quot;With regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, &#x27;Subway Footlong&#x27; is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in Subway Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of length.&quot; Discovery during a subsequent class-action lawsuit revealed that most Subway sandwiches were the advertised length. A $530,000 settlement was thrown out of court in 2017 for being &quot;utterly worthless&quot; to consumers.

===Franchise relations===
In 1995, Subway Sandwich Shops, Fred DeLuca, Peter Buck, and Doctor&#x27;s Associates Inc. were held liable for breach of contract. An Illinois jury awarded more than $10 million in damages to Nicholas and Victoria Jannotta after finding lease and contract violations. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants had misrepresented the asset value of Subway Sandwich Shops (a leasing company used by Doctor&#x27;s Associates for franchising purposes) while negotiating a 1985 lease agreement.

The U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; small business committee studied the franchise industry from 1992 to 1998. Dean Sagar noted, &quot;Subway is the biggest problem in franchising and emerges as one of the key examples of every abuse you can think of.&quot; In 1989, the U.S. Small Business Administration refused small business loans to Subway franchise owners until Subway removed a contract clause which gave it the power to seize and purchase any franchise without cause. &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reported Subway had seized American soldier Leon Batie Jr.&#x27;s Subway stores in 2006 while he was serving in Afghanistan. He had been deployed to support Operation Enduring Freedom in March 2005, three years after buying his first restaurant. Batie alleged Subway had violated the U.S. Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. He filed a federal lawsuit against Subway, which was dismissed. He then filed suit in state court in Dallas County, Texas. Both parties settled on &quot;mutually agreeable&quot; and confidential terms in January 2010.

===United Kingdom VAT treatment===
In October 2010, Subway franchisees in the United Kingdom lost a high court appeal against paying standard VAT on all toasted subs, as required by HM Revenue and Customs. Thus, in the United Kingdom, a toasted sub attracts VAT, whereas a cold sub, eaten off the premises, does not. Competitors such as Quiznos and McDonald&#x27;s do not pay VAT on similar food.

In March 2012, Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne announced plans to close the loophole that allows Subway competitors to offer hot food without paying VAT. This legislation was expected to come into force from October 2012 onward, but on May 28, 2012, the government withdrew plans to charge VAT on originally hot food being allowed to cool naturally. In June 2012, Subway launched the &quot;Toast the Tax&quot; campaign to put pressure on the government to drop VAT on toasted sandwiches, as it has done for hot savouries.

===Footlong trademark disputes===
On January 31, 2011, Subway lawyer Valerie Pochron wrote to Casey&#x27;s General Stores, a chain of Iowa-based convenience stores, demanding that the small chain cease using the term &quot;footlong&quot; in advertisements for its 12-inch sandwiches. Subway threatened to sue. Consequently, in February 2011, Casey&#x27;s General Stores Inc. filed a petition in a U.S. District Court in Des Moines, seeking a legal declaration that the word &quot;footlong&quot; does not violate Subway&#x27;s rights. Casey&#x27;s further sought a declaration that the word &quot;footlong&quot; is a generic description of a sandwich measuring one foot. Before serving its complaint on Subway, Casey&#x27;s voluntarily dismissed its action, ending the litigation.

Subway&#x27;s trademark application for &quot;footlong&quot; has yet to be approved by the federal government. Subway has attempted to register it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office twice. It filed on November 8, 2007, and June 4, 2009. Both filings have been abandoned, on November 20, 2013, and August 21, 2014, respectively. Yum Brands (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and non-Canadian A&amp;W locations), Long John Silver&#x27;s, and other competitors opposed the applications.

===Ingredients===
Subway removed azodicarbonamide from its bread after food blogger and activist Vani Hari gathered more than 50,000 signatures in a petition drive. Before Vani Hari&#x27;s petition, Subway had used azodicarbonamide as a bread conditioner, to whiten the dough and allow sandwich bread to bake more quickly. , the ingredient was still used by other fast food restaurants.

In August 2015, Vani Hari again petitioned Subway in conjunction with Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, the Center for Food Safety, U.S. Public Interest Research Group to commit to buying meat produced without the routine use of antibiotics and to provide a timeline for doing so. In October 2015, Subway announced it would transition to chicken raised without antibiotics in 2016 and turkey within the following 2–3 years, and would also transition beef and pork raised without antibiotics by 2025.

In 2020, the Supreme Court of Ireland ruled that Subway bread had too high a sugar content to be classed as bread for VAT reasons, with its recipe including sugar equal to 10% of the weight of the flour.

In 2021, a lawsuit was filed against the company alleging that the ingredient Subway bills as &quot;tuna&quot; was a mixture of &quot;various concoctions that do not constitute tuna, yet have been blended together by defendants to imitate the appearance of tuna&quot;. The company&#x27;s senior director for global food safety and quality said in a statement that &quot;Our restaurants receive pure tuna, mix it with mayonnaise and serve on a freshly made sandwich to our guests.&quot; The investigative TV show &quot;Inside Edition&quot; sent samples of Subway&#x27;s tuna salad to Applied Food Technologies, a Florida company that carries out DNA testing of seafood. According to that company, &quot;Yes, we confirmed that tuna was definitely in all three samples we received.&quot; Subway established a website, SubwayTunaFacts.com, to refute the claims that they did not use real tuna, which they have denied unambiguously.

===Soy protein in chicken products===
In an investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)&#x27;s consumer affairs television series &quot;Marketplace&quot; aired in February 2017, chicken from five fast-food restaurants was lab-tested to determine constituents. While DNA testing found between 84.9% and 89.4% of the DNA from other restaurants&#x27; chicken products to be chicken DNA, with the remaining being unidentifiable plant DNA, on the two Subway chicken items tested, 53.6% and 42.8% of the DNA was found to be chicken, with the remainder being mostly soy. Although ingredients listings did show soy protein to be a constituent of both of the chicken products, Subway states that the proportion is less than or equal to 1% and that the finding of about 50% soy DNA is not representative of the actual amount of soy in the product. Subway has called CBC&#x27;s report &quot;absolutely false and misleading&quot; and demanded that it be retracted. Meanwhile, however, Subway Canada stated that it was investigating with its supplier to ensure that the proportion of soy protein was as per expectations.

According to Subway&#x27;s website, U.S. stores&#x27; ingredients may differ from those in Canadian stores. Both countries include soy protein in chicken strips, but only the U.S. version states that it is present in quantities of 2% or less. The Canadian version includes soy as an ingredient in its chicken patty, but the United States version does not.

In April 2017, Subway sued the CBC, as well as the reporter and two producers, for $210 million, alleging the CBC acted &quot;recklessly and maliciously&quot; and that &quot;these false statements... were published and republished, maliciously and without just cause or excuse, to a global audience, which has resulted in pecuniary loss to the plaintiffs.&quot; The CBC stood by its reports, stating that the DNA tests were done by independent and credible experts. The CBC&#x27;s Emma Bédard stated that Subway had not provided an alternative explanation for the DNA test results obtained by the CBC.

In November 2019, Subway&#x27;s lawsuit against the CBC was dismissed through anti-SLAPP legislation, as CBC&#x27;s reporting was deemed to be a matter of public interest. In January 2021 the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the decision dismissing the lawsuit. The Supreme Court of Canada denied leave for appeal, so the matter has been returned to the Superior Court of Justice for trial.

===Underpaying workers===
In 2019, the Fair Work Ombudsman found that 17 Australian-based Subway franchises had underpaid workers. The lengthy investigation by the Ombudsman specifically found that franchises failed to pay the employees minimum wages, casual loadings, holiday and overtime rates, and did not issue proper pay slips or keep proper employment records. The investigation resulted in over $81,000 being recovered in unpaid wages for over 160 employees. Subway responded by introducing a rolling audit of franchisee employment records and commented that franchise agreements could be terminated if franchisees failed to meet Australian workplace laws and Subway&#x27;s internal standards of operation.

=== Calls for boycott over the Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Subway was criticized for not divesting or scaling back its operations in Russia, unlike most of its competitors. Subway issued a statement saying its corporate office does not own any of the 446 Subway stores in Russia, and issued a statement saying, &quot;In addition to working with our franchisees across Europe to provide meals to refugees, we will redirect any profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts supporting Ukrainians who have been affected by the war. Our restaurants in Russia are all independently owned and operated by local franchisees and managed by an independent master franchisee.&quot; Nevertheless, Ukraine&#x27;s National Agency on Corruption Prevention stated that Subway continues advertising in Russia and collecting payments from its Russian franchisees, and listed Subway among International Sponsors of War in January 2024.

<text>The Amung (also known as Amungme, Amungm, Amui, Amuy, Hamung, or Uhunduni) people are a group of about 17,700 people living in the highlands of the Central Papua province of Indonesia. Most Amungme live in Mimika and Puncak, in valleys like Noema, Tsinga, Hoeya, Bella, Alama, Aroanop, and Wa. A related group lives in Beoga Valley, Puncak and they are called Damal people.

Their language is called Amung-kal spoken mostly in the southern regions. In the north, it is called Damal-kal. Additionally, they have symbolic languages called Aro-a-kal and Tebo-a-kal. Tebo-a-kal is only spoken in sacred areas.

The traditional beliefs of the Amungme people are animistic. The Amungme people did not have the idea of &quot;gods&quot; that are separate from nature where spirits and nature are the same. They see themselves as the eldest child of God &quot;Nagawan Into&quot;, hence conqueror and ruler of the world &quot;Amungsa&quot;.

They practice shifting agriculture, supplementing their livelihood by hunting and gathering. The Amungme are very tied to their ancestral land and consider the surrounding mountains to be sacred.

This has led to friction with the Indonesian government and Freeport-McMoRan, which is eager to exploit the vast mineral deposits contained there. Major changes in the Amungme of the highlands and Kamoro of the lowlands lifestyle have been brought about by the Grasberg mine, situated in the heart of Amungme territory and owned by Freeport-McMoRan, the region&#x27;s largest single employer. Extensive gold and copper mining have altered the landscape, and the presence of the mine and its infrastructure has attracted numerous other economic migrants from regions in Indonesia including other Papuans, some of whom have tried to settle on traditional Amungme lands. This has caused a land dispute regarding customary land rights between the Amungme people against the Freeport mining company in Timika. In the last 35 years, the Amungme have seen their sacred mountain destroyed by the Freeport mine and watched as their relatives are killed and caught in the conflict between Indonesian soldiers and Free Papua Movement rebels, while the Kamoro have more than 200,000 tons of mining waste pumped into their rivers each day. All these factors have created complex social and political stresses and led to somewhat frequent protests and/or social conflicts, some of which have been violently suppressed by the Indonesian police or military.

<doc id="54583" wikidata="Q3435610" url="?curid=54583" title="Enxet">
<text>The Enxet are an indigenous people of about 17,000 living in the Gran Chaco region of western Paraguay. Originally hunter-gatherers, many are now forced to supplement their livelihood as laborers on the cattle ranches that have encroached upon their dwindling natural forest habitat. Nevertheless, the Enxet are engaged in an ongoing conflict with the government and ranchers, who want to destroy what remains of the forest to open the land for massive settlement. Today, only a handful of Enxet are still maintain their traditional way of life, while the majority live in small settlements sponsored by various missionary organizations. The Enxet and Enlhet languages are still vigorous.

==Land ownership==

In 2006, 90 Enxet families, the Sawhoyamaxa, won a legal battle to 14,404 hectares of their traditional lands, bought up by Heribert Roedel. The land was signed over in 2011.

== Lingering Effects of the Chaco War on the Enxet People ==
The Enxet tribe suffered devastating blows during the Chaco War period (1932-1935). The Chaco War was fought between Bolivia and Paraguay over control of natural resources in the Chaco region of South America. The front of this war stretched directly through Chaco territory, ravaging ancestral lands and severely disrupting cultural way of life.

During the military colonization of Chaco, the Enxet verbal history was damaged, as members of the tribe were killed before sharing their history. To make matters worse, they were struck with a brutal smallpox epidemic in 1932, which resulted in the deaths of nearly half of the Enxet population. The Paraguayans also abused the Enxet natives, with a first hand Enxet report stating: &quot;They {Paraguayans} wanted the women. If a man refused they would kill him, even if he was a leader. The Paraguayans had no qualms about shooting an Enxet.&quot; Though no conscription is overly reported, the Enxet population was targeted by both Bolivia and Paraguay due to fears revolving around the Natives being spies. This would lead to further devastation among the populace of the Chaco region.

In the aftermath of Paraguay&#x27;s victory in the Chaco War, the government became more committed to settling and developing the Chaco. Subsequently, much of Enxet land would be divided, deforested, and given to cattle farmers. The deforestation coupled with the overgrazing of cattle left the land forever scarred. Today, the Enxet hold title to approximately 2.8 percent of the area they occupied before the start of the Chaco War. Their population has yet to recover, and is currently only about 8,200 strong.

===Court case, water and other rights===
The right to water was considered in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights case of the &quot;Sawhoyamaxa Indigenous Community v. Paraguay&quot;. The issues involved the states failure to acknowledge indigenous communities&#x27; property rights over ancestral lands. In 1991, the state removed the indigenous Sawhoyamaxa community from the land resulting in their loss of access to water, food, schooling and health services. This fell within the scope of the American Convention on Human Rights; article 4, encroaching the right to life. Water is included in this right, as part of access to land. The courts required the lands to be returned, compensation provided, and basic goods and services to be implemented, while the community was in the process of having their lands returned.

===Re-occupation===
In 2013, the land still not being vacated, the Sawhoyamaxa re-occupied the land.

===Supreme court ruling===
In 2014 the Paraguay Supreme Court rejected a claim that government expropriation of the land (in order to transfer it to the Sawhoyamaxa), was unconstitutional.

<doc id="54586" wikidata="Q230506" url="?curid=54586" title="Quantum Leap (1989 TV series)">
<text>Quantum Leap is an American science fiction television series, created by Donald P. Bellisario, that aired on NBC for five seasons, from March 26, 1989, to May 5, 1993. The series stars Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a physicist who, believing he has invented a way to travel through time, voluntarily subjects himself to an experiment that he believes will prove the validity of his controversial theories. Sam “leaps” into the fluid of spacetime and apparently disappears forever. However, it is soon revealed that Beckett&#x27;s consciousness is alive and able to transfer to and inhabit the bodies of other people existing on his timeline. The artificially intelligent computer he created operates with the assumption that in order to return home, Sam must change events in the past in order to &quot;correct&quot; the future course of events, which have somehow been changed in an undesirable way by an unknown agent.

Dean Stockwell co-stars as Rear Admiral Al Calavicci, Sam&#x27;s womanizing, cigar-smoking companion and best friend, who appears only as a hologram. Al is able to research the life Sam currently inhabits, providing advice when needed, and he is the only person able to see Sam when Sam has travelled through time, and is therefore the only witness who can testify that project Quantum Leap has been successful. 

The series, which combines humor, drama, romance, social commentary, and science fiction, was ranked number 19 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &quot;Top Cult Shows Ever&quot; in 2007.

A revival series, following the original show&#x27;s continuity, ran on NBC from 2022 to 2024.

==Premise and characters==
In the very near future, physicist Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) theorizes that time travel within one&#x27;s own lifetime is possible, and obtains government support to build project &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;. Some years later, having already spent $43 billion, the government threatens to halt funding, as apparently no progress has been made. Sam then decides to test the project accelerator himself to save the project, telling no one. He is immediately thrown back in time, but upon awakening, finds that while he physically exists in the past, he appears to everyone else as a person into whom he has &quot;leapt&quot;, and further has partial amnesia related to his own identity.

A hologram of his best friend, United States Navy Rear Admiral Al Calavicci (Dean Stockwell), appears, visible and audible only to Sam, who explains to Dr. Beckett that it appears he must fix something that &quot;went wrong&quot; in time. Al is aided by project Quantum Leap’s artificially intelligent supercomputer, nicknamed Ziggy, who is described as a &quot;parallel hybrid computer with a massive ego&quot;. Despite successfully changing the past in episode 1, Sam continues to leap, seemingly guided by what is eventually described as “an unknown force&quot; that wants him to put right events in the past that once went wrong, for reasons unknown. Thence forth, Dr. Samuel Beckett leaps from life to life and time to time, attempting to &quot;put right what once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap will be the leap home&quot;.

Sam has six doctoral degrees, a black belt in kung fu, a photographic memory, and near-virtuosic musical talent, allowing him to easily slip into the shoes of almost anyone in the past. The somewhat bookish and naive Sam is contrasted by Al, who is, among other things, a womanizing, cigar-smoking, five-time divorcé who spent his early years in an orphanage, was active in the civil rights movement, and was even a prisoner of war in Vietnam.

Sam and Al are the only characters to appear in every episode. The supporting characters of each episode are the friends, family, and acquaintances of the person Sam has leapt into. With a few exceptions, such as two-part or sequential episodes, these characters appear only once, though several actors have played multiple characters. Occasionally, Sam runs into real-life historical figures such as Buddy Holly, Michael Jackson, Donald Trump, Marilyn Monroe, and Ruth Westheimer, the last of whom played herself.

The other members of the Quantum Leap team, though mentioned often, appear in only a handful of episodes. They include head programmer Irving &quot;Gooshie&quot; Gushman (Dennis Wolfberg), psychiatrist Dr. Verbena Beeks (Candy Ann Brown), medical technician (and Al&#x27;s lover) Tina Martinez (Gigi Rice), and Sam&#x27;s wife, Dr. Donna Eleese (Teri Hatcher/Mimi Kuzyk), the project&#x27;s director in his absence. The latter does not exist as Sam’s wife until Dr. Beckett changes history.

==Production==
===Development===
The main premise for &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; was inspired by such movies as &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; (1941) and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978), as well as the 1960s TV show, &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;. Series creator, Donald P. Bellisario saw its potential as an original anthology series, though at the time, similarly themed shows were unpopular with the major networks.

The series ran on NBC for five seasons, from March 1989 through May 1993.

The theme for the series, written by Mike Post, was later rearranged for the fifth season, except for the series-finale episode, which featured the original theme music. Scores for the episodes were composed by Post and Velton Ray Bunch.

A soundtrack album was first released in 1993, titled &quot;Music from the Television Series &#x27;Quantum Leap&#x27; &quot;, dedicated to John Anderson, who played Pat Knight in &quot;The Last Gunfighter&quot;. It was released by GNP Crescendo on CD and cassette tape.

==Episodes==
===Broadcast history===
The &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; series, though initially scheduled to air on Friday nights, was almost immediately moved to Wednesday evenings. Later on, as the show became more successful, it was moved to Fridays. In late 1992, it began to air on Tuesdays. The series finale aired on a Wednesday in May, 1993.

The most frequent time slot for the series is indicated by &quot;italics&quot;:
* Sunday at 9:00–11:00 pm on NBC: March 26, 1989
* Friday at 9:00–10:00 pm on NBC: March 31, 1989 – April 21, 1989
* &quot;Wednesday at 10:00–11:00 pm on NBC: May 3—17, 1989; September 20, 1989 – May 9, 1990; March 6, 1991 – May 20, 1992&quot;
* Friday at 8:00–9:00 pm on NBC: September 28, 1990 – January 4, 1991
* Tuesday at 8:00–9:00 pm on NBC: September 22, 1992 – April 20, 1993
* Wednesday at 9:00–10:00 pm on NBC: May 4, 1993

In the United Kingdom, the show began on BBC Two on February 13, 1990, airing Tuesday evenings at 9:00 pm. The final episode was scheduled to be aired on June 14, 1994, but altered schedules after the death of British dramatist Dennis Potter earlier that month delayed the airing until June 21, 1994. Repeat episodes continued on the channel at various times until December 28, 1999.

==== Quantum Leap Week ====
During the summer of 1990, NBC scheduled a &quot;Quantum Leap Week&quot;. Over the course of five consecutive nights, repeat episodes of the show were broadcast in an effort to drum up interest in the fledging series. The &quot;Quantum Leap Week&quot; was repeated during the summer of 1991. Each of the weekly events was supported by a series of advertisements. In each were a series of &quot;man-on-the-street&quot; attempting to say &quot;Quantum Leap Week&quot; fast, with varied levels of success.

===Home media===
Universal Studios has released the entire, digitally remastered, &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; series on DVD. Some controversy arose when fans discovered that many songs had been replaced from the soundtrack due to music rights issues. For the fifth season, Universal included all of the original music.

On April 13, 2016, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that it had acquired the rights to the series and re-released the first two seasons on DVD on June 7, 2016.

On February 7, 2017, Mill Creek re-released &quot;Quantum Leap - the Complete Series&quot; on DVD and also released the complete series on Blu-ray for the first time. The 18-disc set contains all 97 episodes of the series, as well as most of the original music restored for all seasons.

=== Final episode ===
At the end of season five, Bellisario was told to write an episode that could serve as a season finale or series finale, as it was unclear whether &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; would be renewed. The episode contained some answers to long-standing questions about the show, but contained enough ambiguity for a season six. When the show was not renewed, two title cards were tacked on to the end of the last episode; one read that Al&#x27;s first wife Beth never remarried, so they were still married in the present day and had four daughters. The last title cards said &quot;Sam Becket [sic] never returned home.&quot; The finale was met by viewers with mixed feelings.

A few years after the airing of the finale, a script for an alternate ending was leaked on the internet. It implied that Al, through encouragement of his wife Beth, would become a leaper to go after Sam. Bellisario has said no script exists and that he does not know where this idea came from. In 2018, however, fan Allison Pregler purchased title cards taken from season five that contained some shots of Al and Beth together; this implies that part of the alternate ending was, in fact, shot and gives credibility to the alternate-ending scenario. In May 2019, a video of the lost footage was uploaded to Reddit by a contributor with the handle Leaper1953. How this person obtained the footage is not known publicly. Scott Bakula confirmed that several endings were shot and that the footage was authentic.

==Reception==
The series had a slow start in the ratings, and its timeslot was moved often, but it did well in the 18–49 demographic. The finale was viewed by 13 million American households. In 2004 and 2007, &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; was ranked number 15 and 19, respectively, on &quot;TV Guide&quot; &quot;Top Cult Shows Ever&quot;.

Along with 43 nominations, &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; received 17 awards (listed below).

Few of the comic stories referenced episodes of the television series, with the exception of the ninth issue, &quot;Up Against a Stonewall&quot;.

==Continuation==

===Proposed films===

====Television film====
In July 2002, the Sci-Fi Channel (which at the time was airing reruns of the show) announced development of a two-hour television film based on &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; that would have served as a backdoor pilot for a new series, with Bellisario as executive producer.

====Feature film====
In July 2010 during the &quot;TV Guide&quot; panel at San Diego Comic-Con, Scott Bakula said that Bellisario was working on a script for a projected &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; feature film. Bellisario confirmed in October 2017 at the L.A. Comic Con that he had finished the script.

===Revival===

In January 2020, Jeff Bader, NBC&#x27;s head of program planning and strategy, announced that the network was considering a reboot of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; for the launch of its Peacock streaming service.

In January 2022, NBC greenlit a pilot episode of a &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; sixth season revival. Bellisario is involved, while the showrunners include Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt, with Deborah Pratt and Martin Gero as executive producers. The pilot will take place 30 years after the conclusion of the original series, with a new team reviving Project Quantum Leap to understand both it and the fate of Sam Beckett. Raymond Lee was signed to star in the pilot in the role of Dr. Ben Song, the person that ends up traveling back in time through the Quantum Leap project. Ernie Hudson was cast as Herbert &quot;Magic&quot; Williams, the lead of the new Quantum Leap program and a Vietnam War veteran whom Sam leaped into in the season three episode &quot;The Leap Home (Part 2) – Vietnam&quot;. NBC gave the green light for a full season order in May 2022. In July 2022, it was announced that Dean Georgaris joined as showrunner. It premiered on September 19, 2022, airing on Monday nights.

In September 2022, original series star Scott Bakula confirmed that he had been asked by producers to reprise his role as Sam Beckett in the revival, but ultimately decided against it, saying in a statement on Instagram, &quot;As the show has always been near and dear to my heart, it was a very difficult decision to pass on the project&quot;.

On April 5, 2024, it was confirmed that the series had been canceled after two seasons.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Source Code&quot;, a 2011 science-fiction action thriller film, was directed by Duncan Jones. Jones said in reading its script that he was reminded of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; and as a reference to the show, cast Bakula in a voice cameo role, including giving him one line of &quot;Oh, boy&quot; in the script.

Special episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (&quot;Detained&quot;, 2002) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;&quot;, 2014), both series that featured Bakula as lead, included Stockwell as a guest star to reunite the two actors from &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;. Further, &quot;Chasing Ghosts&quot; was directed by James Whitmore Jr., who had directed 15 episodes, and acted in three episodes, of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;.

The 2017 episode &quot;The Gang Turns Black&quot; of the series &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; features numerous &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; references. When the gang finds themselves in different bodies, Sweet Dee suggests that they are &quot;quantum leaping&quot;. Bakula has a guest appearance, as himself, supposedly researching an upcoming role, but in fact working as a retirement home custodian due to lack of residuals.

In the 2019 film &quot;,&quot; Scott Lang brings the show up as one of many examples of time travel in fiction allowing one to change one&#x27;s own past, contrasting Bruce Banner&#x27;s explanation that time travel works differently in their universe.

<doc id="54587" wikidata="Q36275" url="?curid=54587" title="Root beer">
<text>Root beer is a sweet North American soft drink traditionally made using the root bark of the sassafras tree &quot;Sassafras albidum&quot; or the vine of &quot;Smilax ornata&quot; (known as sarsaparilla; also used to make a soft drink called sarsaparilla) as the primary flavor. Root beer is typically, but not exclusively, non-alcoholic, caffeine-free, sweet, and carbonated. Like cola, it usually has a thick and foamy head. A common use is to add vanilla ice cream to make a root beer float.

Since safrole, a key component of sassafras, was banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1960 due to its carcinogenicity, most commercial root beers have been flavored using artificial sassafras flavoring, but a few (e.g. Hansen&#x27;s) use a safrole-free sassafras extract.

Major root beer producers include PepsiCo, Coca-Cola Company, Dad&#x27;s, Keurig Dr. Pepper, Sprecher, and A&amp;W.

==History==
Root beer has been drunk in the United States since at least the eighteenth century. It has been sold in confectionery stores since at least the 1840s, and written recipes for root beer have been documented since the 1830s. In the nineteenth century, it was often consumed hot and was often used with medicinal intent. It was combined with soda as early as the 1850s; at that time it was sold as a syrup rather than a ready-made beverage.

Beyond its aromatic qualities, the medicinal benefits of sassafras were well known to both Native Americans and Europeans, and druggists began marketing root beer for its medicinal qualities.
Pharmacist Charles Elmer Hires was the first to successfully market a commercial brand of root beer. Hires developed his made from sassafras in 1875, debuted a commercial version of root beer at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876, and began selling his extract. Hires was a teetotaler who wanted to call the beverage &quot;root tea&quot;. However, his desire to market the product to Pennsylvania coal miners caused him to call his product &quot;root beer&quot;, instead.

In 1886, Hires began to bottle a beverage made from his famous extract. By 1893, root beer was distributed widely across the United States. Non-alcoholic versions of root beer became commercially successful, especially during Prohibition.

Not all traditional or commercial root beers were sassafras-based. One of Hires&#x27;s early competitors was Barq&#x27;s, which began selling its sarsaparilla-based root beer in 1898 and was labeled simply as &quot;Barq&#x27;s&quot;.

In 1919, Roy Allen opened his root-beer stand in Lodi, California, which led to the development of A&amp;W Root Beer. One of Allen&#x27;s innovations was that he served his homemade root beer in cold, frosty mugs. IBC Root Beer is another brand of commercially produced root beer that emerged during this period and is still well-known today.

Safrole, the aromatic oil found in sassafras roots and bark that gave traditional root beer its distinctive flavor, was banned in commercially mass-produced foods and drugs by the FDA in 1960. Laboratory animals that were given oral doses of sassafras tea or sassafras oil that contained large doses of safrole developed permanent liver damage or various types of cancer. While sassafras is no longer used in commercially produced root beer and is sometimes replaced with artificial flavors, natural extracts with the safrole distilled and removed are available.

==Traditional method==
One traditional recipe for making root beer involves cooking a syrup from molasses and water, letting the syrup cool for three hours, and combining it with the root ingredients (including sassafras root, sassafras bark, and wintergreen). Yeast was added, and the beverage was left to ferment for 12 hours, after which it was strained and rebottled for secondary fermentation. This recipe usually resulted in a beverage of 2% alcohol or less, although the recipe could be modified to produce a more alcoholic beverage (such variation is called &quot;hard root beer&quot;).

==Foam==
Root beer was originally made with sassafras root and bark which, due to its mucilaginous properties, formed a natural, long lasting foam, a characteristic feature of the beverage. Root beer was originally carbonated by fermentation. As demand and technology changed, carbonated water was used. Some manufacturers used small amounts of starch (e.g. from cassava) with natural surfactants to reproduce the familiar foaming character of sassafras-based root beer. Some brands of root beer have distinctive foaming behaviors, which has been used as part of their marketing identity.

==Ingredients==
Commercial root beer is now produced in Canada and every U.S. state. Although this beverage&#x27;s popularity is greatest in North America, some brands are produced in or imported by other countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Argentina, Germany, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Sweden, Vietnam, and Thailand. The flavor of these beverages may vary from typical North American versions, or be similar to those found in North America. While no standard recipe exists, the primary ingredients in modern root beer are filtered water, sugar, and safrole-free sassafras extract, which complements other flavors. Common flavorings are vanilla, caramel, wintergreen, black cherry bark, licorice root, sarsaparilla root, nutmeg, acacia, anise, molasses, cinnamon, sweet birch, and honey. Soybean protein or yucca are sometimes used to create a foamy quality, and caramel coloring is used to make the beverage brown.

Ingredients in early and traditional root beers include allspice, birch bark, coriander, juniper, ginger, wintergreen, hops, burdock root, dandelion root, spikenard, pipsissewa, guaiacum chips, sarsaparilla, spicewood, wild cherry bark, yellow dock, prickly ash bark, sassafras root, vanilla beans, dog grass, molasses and licorice. Many of these ingredients are still used in traditional and commercially produced root beer today, which is often thickened, foamed or carbonated.

Most major brands other than Barq&#x27;s are caffeine-free (Barq&#x27;s contains about 1.8 mg of caffeine per fluid ounce).

Root beer can be made at home with processed extract obtained from a factory, or it can also be made from herbs and roots that have not yet been processed. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic traditional root beers make a thick and foamy head when poured, often enhanced by the addition of yucca extract, soybean protein, or other thickeners.

Alcoholic root beers produced in the 2000s have included Small Town Brewery&#x27;s Not Your Father&#x27;s Root Beer; Coney Island Brewing Co.&#x27;s hard root beer; and Best Damn Brewing Co.&#x27;s Best Damn Root Beer.
