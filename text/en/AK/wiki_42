<text>is a 26-episode Japanese anime television series created and written by Ryōe Tsukimura and produced by Victor Entertainment and Bee Train. The series was directed by Kōichi Mashimo, with Yoko Kikuchi, Minako Shiba and Satoko Miyachi in charge of character designs, Kenji Teraoka in charge of mechanical design, and Yuki Kajiura composing the music. The DVD version was released by ADV Films in North America and the United Kingdom and by Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand.

&quot;Noir&quot; was followed by two spiritual successors, &quot;Madlax&quot; and &quot;El Cazador de la Bruja&quot;. Together, these series constitute a trilogy exploring the &quot;girls-with-guns&quot; genre.

==Plot==
Opening introduction, Kirika&#x27;s (later with Mireille) voice-over towards the audience:

The series follows the story of two young female assassins, the Corsican Mireille Bouquet and the Japanese amnesiac Kirika Yuumura, who embark together on a personal journey to seek answers about mysteries concerning their past. At first, they seem to be only vaguely related to each other, but there are clues and hints given throughout the series that there is more going on behind the scenes than at first glance.

In their journey to learn more about Kirika&#x27;s lost memories and her connection to Mireille, the two form an alliance and begin performing assassinations under the code name &quot;Noir.&quot; During the course of the series, they are lured into more and more traps by a secret organization named &quot;Les Soldats&quot; (&quot;The Soldiers&quot; in French). Les Soldats are a secret organization that has been a part, yet separate group of humanity. It is this hidden group that created and once completely controlled the deadly duo &quot;Noir&quot;. Each time that Les Soldats soldiers are sent to kill Mireille and Kirika, it is considered a test as to whether or not the young women are suitable to carry the title &quot;Noir&quot;.

==Characters==
; 
: Kirika is a teenage high school girl with amnesia who lives in Japan, however during her journey she goes to stay with Mireille in her apartment which resides in Paris; the only things she remembers are the word &quot;Noir&quot; and her instinctual killing abilities. When creating the characters for &quot;Noir&quot;, producer Shigeru Kitayama wanted the image of Kirika to be &quot;sweet and fragile&quot;.
: 
: Mireille is a Corsican woman born into a powerful crime family. Mireille and her uncle are the sole survivors of a brutal attack on her family, whereafter he trained her to become an assassin. When creating the character for &quot;Noir&quot;, Shigeru Kitayama imagined Mireille as &quot;a lithe female panther&quot;. Mitsuishi, the Japanese voice of Mireille, previously worked with Kitayama on &quot;Excel Saga&quot;, where she voiced the protagonist Excel; the first thing she was told was that Excel and Mireille are completely opposite characters. In the English dub, ADV Films decided against giving Mireille a Corsican accent so as to avoid confusion among viewers unfamiliar with the language.
: 
: Chloe is a skilled assassin who uses throwing and handheld knives instead of guns. Like Kirika and Mireille, Chloe is a candidate to become Noir. Chloe idolizes Kirika for her exceptional killing skills, and she believes that she and Kirika are destined to become Noir together. She is the personal favorite character of &quot;Noir&quot;″s composer Yuki Kajiura.
: 
: Altena is the high priestess of the Soldats. She believes that the Soldats have been corrupted by power and greed, and she attempts to return the Soldats to its &quot;original state&quot; by reviving Noir. She lives a medieval lifestyle in a place the Soldats consider as their holy site called &quot;The Manor&quot;, located somewhere on the border between France and Spain, where she raised and trained Chloe.

==Setting==
Unlike its spiritual successors &quot;Madlax&quot; and &quot;El Cazador de la Bruja&quot;, &quot;Noir&quot; is mainly about reality&#x27;s criminal underworld while the later two are about supernatural events. Mireille and Kirika, in episode four, check the profile of a fifteen-year-old student named Rosaly Hammond, discovering that she was born on August 2, 1994. As Rosaly would be turning sixteen, Noir thus takes place approximately between 2010 and 2011.

===Les Soldats===
 (&quot;The Soldiers&quot; in French) is a mysterious organization in &quot;Noir&quot;. According to Altena, a thousand years ago, a group of people who had survived a bloody war that cost numerous lives, formed a group called &quot;Les Soldats&quot; to protect the weak and take revenge on the world. When Kirika travels to a Soldats&#x27; village, she finds out that during the late tenth century, &quot;Les Soldats&quot; has taken place in every social part of humankind. For example, Soldats were witnessed at the birth of the Greone&#x27;s mafia family, which was created 200 years ago from the time the series began. Near the end of the series, Altena states that &quot;Les Soldats&quot; have been consumed by the very greed they once swore to undo, and thus had become like the world itself.

Although the Soldats were founded by a united group, in &quot;Noir&quot; its members were separated into two groups: Altena&#x27;s followers and her opposers, the Soldats&#x27; Council members. For easy identification, Altena&#x27;s most loyal followers are include people who dress up as nuns and common villagers who are skilled at fighting These nuns and priestesses often appear to be ordinary, petite women, they are capable of using guns and other lethal weapons. Altena lives in a manor not located on any map but is near the border of France and Spain. It is known by name &quot;the place which has been forgotten by time&quot;. The manor&#x27;s structure is similar to those of Ancient Greece and Rome. Separated from the manor by mountains, there is a village which belongs to Altena, and their ancient task is to guard her manor.

The Soldats&#x27; Council are the people who disagreed with Altena&#x27;s decision to bring back the True Noir by means of a ritual called the Grand Retour. The Council contains five members, and one of them, Remy Brefford, invites Mireille to join their ranks, and he has an office in a building in Paris.

Men in black suits are often sent by the Soldats to try to kill the Noir candidates, but the faction affiliate of these men is unclear. Altena successfully manipulates everyone in the group, and she particularly targets the three Noir candidates Chloe, Kirika, and Mireille. She hides her true agenda from the Soldats, even her most trusted advisers, until the end. Altena led the Soldats to believe that she wanted Chloe and Kirika to be the True Noir, to enforce the will of the Soldats. However, she believed that Mireille and Kirika would enact her true plan, to destroy the Soldats. Altena&#x27;s plan was not fully successful because Mireille did not target the Council at the end of the series.

===Noir===
&quot;Noir&quot; is the French word for &quot;black&quot;. In &quot;Noir&quot;, it is known as the name of the two maidens who govern death. Pictures and sculptures of the two maidens can be seen on Mireille&#x27;s father&#x27;s watch and on Soldats&#x27; churches. To the underworld, it is known as the &quot;One Thousand Year&quot; darkness of Europe. According to Altena&#x27;s story, when the Soldats went under, two hands were left on the surface, so their ancient task is to retrieve the two maidens known as &quot;Noir&quot;. The ritual to become Noir takes place under Altena&#x27;s manor, an underground temple in the style of ancient Greek ruins.

Throughout the series, the only three candidates for &quot;Noir&quot; are Mireille Bouquet, Kirika Yuumura and Chloe. Of all the three, Mireille was the only who was predicted to be neglected, and Kirika probably is the only who can turn into &quot;True Noir&quot;. When one has fallen, the remaining two shall become Noir.

==Production==
According to the director Kōichi Mashimo, he envisioned &quot;Noir&quot; and &quot;Madlax&quot; as part of a trilogy exploring the girls-with-guns genre, and soon after the release of the latter, he confirmed having plans to produce the third installment, which would later become &quot;El Cazador de la Bruja&quot;.

For Mireille&#x27;s personal sidearm, Mashimo wanted a gun with &quot;a more modern image&quot;, therefore the production staff decided on the Walther P99. After considering several compact pistols, including the Walther PPK and the Glock 26, for Kirika&#x27;s personal sidearm, the Beretta M1934 became the weapon of choice, because of its &quot;classic, European feel&quot; that suited the premise of the series&#x27; story. Because of the organization&#x27;s premise, European guns were chosen for the members of Les Soldats. The assassins in black suits that are sent after the protagonists throughout the series all carry the SIG Pro 2340, which at the time of production was the newest model of its line, while other members were given increasingly older weapons, depending on the member&#x27;s rank.

According to producer Shigeru Kitayama, Kotono Mitsuishi&#x27;s voicing of Mireille was a continuation of the working relationship they had from creating &quot;Excel Saga&quot;, where Mitsuishi voiced the protagonist Excel.

By January 2013, Starz CEO Chris Albrecht announced that the project remained at a standstill citing difficulty to get the project creatively to a good place.

==Reception==
Critical reception of &quot;Noir&quot; has been positive. &quot;Newtype&quot; ranked &quot;Noir&quot; second in its top 10 list of anime of the year 2001. &quot;Noir&quot; also made a top three place in the top 20 anime in Japan chart by &quot;Anihabara!&quot; in October 2001. In the June 2002 issue of &quot;Animage&quot;, &quot;Noir&quot; was voted by the magazine&#x27;s readers onto a shared 10th place in the best 20 new anime of 2001 in Japan. Josh Mohs of Active Anime commented that &quot;&quot;Noir&quot; doesn&#x27;t fail to deliver mystery, action, and drama.&quot; Though he lamented &quot;some pacing problems, especially towards the beginning of the series,&quot; he lauded the character interactions as well as the series&#x27; &quot;job of tying together all its inherent sub-plots&quot; and the director&#x27;s &quot;bold move&quot; in leaving &quot;the ending open to viewer interpretation.&quot; In a review of the first DVD compilation by ADV Films, Jeremy Conrad of IGN lauded the series for being &quot;stylistic&quot;, stating that &quot;It oozes style&quot;, and for its &quot;extremely cool&quot; fight choreography and &quot;great&quot; shootouts, saying that &quot;What &quot;Noir&quot; does right is its action.&quot; He also noted the series&#x27; character design as being &quot;solid&quot; and the series&#x27; soundtrack as being &quot;excellent&quot;, reminiscent of &quot;Éric Serra&#x27;s stuff in movies such as &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, but lamented about the slowed pace at the end of the volume, stating that &quot;some of the story stuff they were trying to do [in the fourth and fifth episodes] was snooze inducing.&quot; Josh Mohs of Active Anime commentEd that &quot;Noir&quot;″s &quot;strong character interactions are usually enough to pull you through&quot; the pacing problems he saw with the series and further states that, along with the series&#x27; &quot;unique twists&quot;, the &quot;intriguing character dynamic definitely elevate[s] it above the rest of the competition.&quot; Kirika had been voted with Mireille as two of the top ten female anime characters by &quot;Newtype&quot; in 2001.

Anime News Network&#x27;s Theron Martin, ten years after the show&#x27;s original run, gave the series a rating of B+, and commented that &quot;Noir&quot; &quot;was at least to some degree an influential title&quot; and &quot;is still recognized as one of the preeminent titles of its type because it redefined what a &#x27;girls with guns&#x27; title could be.&quot; He went on to praise the show for its &quot;sleek, elegant story&quot; and called it &quot;anime&#x27;s most pronounced homage to classic film noir&quot;. He named Mireille and Kirika &quot;one of anime&#x27;s most iconic female teams&quot; along with the Dirty Pair and credited Kirika as &quot;a precursor of the moe craze that came along later in the decade.&quot; He named &quot;The Lost Kitten&quot; as the series&#x27; episode with the best story content, and the double episode &quot;The Intoccabile&quot; as having the worst, noting its &quot;hackneyed look into the Cosa Nostra&quot;. He lamented repetitiveness in action sequences and excessive reuse of scenes especially in early episodes as well as the absence of blood in light of the show&#x27;s high body count. He showed himself unimpressed with the animation quality, but lauded the show&#x27;s good looks, in particular those of the environments. He named the &quot;tendency for repetitiveness&quot; of its first half as the soundtrack&#x27;s &quot;only real flaw&quot; and praised the pieces &quot;Salva Nos&quot; and &quot;Canta Per Me&quot; as &quot;stand[ing] among the all-time great anime themes&quot;. About the English version, he commented that the &quot;casting choices fit and match up well against the original performances&quot; and that the &quot;script stays tight enough to avoid garnering any accuracy complaints&quot;. In conclusion, he said &quot;the series works in the ways that it is supposed to work and should keep viewers thoroughly involved through to the end.&quot;

Diane Tiu of THEM Anime Reviews gave &quot;Noir&quot; a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, praising the story, characters, soundtrack, and the relationship between Mireille and Kirika, but questioned the lack of blood and how the main characters always seem to take out their opposition single-handedly. Overall, Tiu concludes that &quot;Noir oozes style. It is an original anime that stands out - the perfect anime if you&#x27;ve had too much fluff.&quot; Enoch Lau, also of THEM Anime Reviews, also gave the series a 4 out of 5 star rating, handing out praise to the animation, visuals, story, soundtrack, action scenes, and the chemistry between Mireille and Kirika. Lau&#x27;s only criticisms was the lack of blood, as well as the slow pacing of the series, but concluded overall that &quot;The cream of action-drama anime has just gotten sweeter and creamier with Noir. The slow pace and sombre mood of the plot might turn off some people, but those who stick with it will be rewarded with brilliant action scenes and awesome chicks with guns.&quot;

<text>The  (; abbreviated OKW [oː kaːˈve] Armed Forces High Command) was the supreme military command and control staff of Nazi Germany during World War II, that was directly subordinated to Hitler. Created in 1938, the OKW replaced the Reich Ministry of War and had nominal oversight over the individual high commands of the country&#x27;s armed forces: the army (), navy () and air force (). With the start of World War II, tactical control of the Waffen-SS was also exercised by it. There was no direct chain of command between the OKW and the other High Commands.

Rivalry with the different services&#x27; commands, mainly with the Army High Command (OKH), prevented the OKW from becoming a unified German General Staff in an effective chain of command, though it did help coordinate operations among the three services. During the war, the OKW acquired more and more operational powers. By 1942, the OKW had responsibility for all theatres except for the Eastern Front. However, Adolf Hitler manipulated the system in order to prevent any one command from taking a dominant role in decision making. This &quot;divide and conquer&quot; method helped put most military decisions in Hitler&#x27;s own hands, which at times included even those affecting engagements at the battalion level, a practice which, due to bureaucratic delays and Hitler&#x27;s worsening indecision as the war progressed, would eventually contribute to Germany&#x27;s defeat.

==Genesis==
The OKW was established by executive decree on 4 February 1938, in the aftermath of the Blomberg-Fritsch affair, which had led to the dismissal of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and head of the Reich Ministry of War, Werner von Blomberg, as well as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Werner von Fritsch.

Adolf Hitler, who had been waiting for an opportunity to gain personal control over the German military, quickly took advantage of the scandal, using the powers granted to him by the Enabling Act to do so. The decree dissolved the ministry and replaced it with the OKW. The OKW was directly subordinate to Hitler in his position as (Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces), to the detriment of the existing military structure.

The OKW was led by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel as Chief of the OKW with the rank of a Reich Minister, which essentially made him the second most powerful person in the armed forces&#x27; hierarchy after Hitler. The next officer after Keitel was Lieutenant General Alfred Jodl, who served as the OKW&#x27;s Chief of Operations Staff. However, despite this seemingly powerful hierarchy, the German military&#x27;s officers mostly disregarded Keitel&#x27;s position, deeming him nothing more than Hitler&#x27;s lackey. Other officers often had direct access to the &quot;Führer&quot;, such as officers with the rank of field marshal, while other officers even outranked Keitel, an example being the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, Hermann Göring. This position ideally meant Göring was subordinate to Keitel, but his alternate rank of made him the second most powerful person in Germany after Hitler, and he used this alternate power to circumvent Keitel and access Hitler directly whenever he wished.

By June 1938, the OKW comprised four departments:
* (WFA; initially , renamed (Wfst) in August 1940) – operations staff. Chief: Colonel General Alfred Jodl, 1 September 1939 – 8 May 1945
** (WFA/L) a subdepartment through which all details of operational planning were worked out, and from which all operational orders were communicated to the OKW. Chief: Major General Walter Warlimont, 1 September 1939 – 6 September 1944; Major General Horst Freiherr Treusch von Buttlar-Brandenfels, 6 September 1944 – 30 November 1944; General August Winter, 1 December 1944 – 23 April 1945
** &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; Propaganda Troops: its function was to produce and disseminate propaganda materials aimed at the German troops and the population. Commanded by General Hasso von Wedel (1 September 1939 – 8 May 1945), the department oversaw the numerous propaganda companies () of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, attached to the fighting troops. At its peak in 1942, the propaganda troops included 15,000 men. Among the propaganda materials produced was the , the official news communiqué about the military situation of Germany and was intended for both domestic and foreign consumption. 
** – army staff. Chief: General Walther Buhle, 15 February 1942 – 8 May 1945
** – Chief of Staff, &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; signal corps
* – foreign intelligence
** – central department. Chief: Major General Hans Oster, 1 September 1939 – January 1944
** – foreign. Chief: Admiral Leopold Bürkner, 15 June 1938 –
** – intelligence. Chief: Colonel Hans Piekenbrock, 1 September 1939 – March 1943; Colonel Georg Hansen, March 1943 – February 1944
** – special service. Chief: Colonel Erwin von Lahousen, 1 September 1939 – July 1943; Colonel Wessel Freytag von Loringhoven, July 1943 – June 1944
** – counter-intelligence. Chief: Colonel , 1 March 1941 –
** – foreign communications
* – supply matters
* – miscellaneous matters
** – information centre for war casualties and prisoners of war

The WFA replaced the (Armed Forces Office) which had existed between 1935 and 1938 within the Reich War Ministry, headed by Keitel. Hitler promoted Keitel to Chief of the OKW (), i.e. Chief of the Armed Forces High Command. As head of the WFA, Keitel appointed although after two months he was removed from command, and this post was not refilled until the promotion of Alfred Jodl. To replace Jodl at the (WFA/L), Walther Warlimont was appointed. In December 1941 further changes took place with the (WFA/L) being merged into the and losing its role as a subordinate organization. These changes were largely cosmetic however as key staff remained in post and continued to fulfill the same duties.

==Operations==
Officially, the OKW served as the military general staff for the Third Reich, coordinating the efforts of the army, navy, and air force. With the start of World War II, tactical control of the Waffen-SS was exercised by the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot;. In practice, however, Hitler used OKW as his personal military staff, translating his ideas into military orders, such as the &quot;Führer&quot; Directives, and issuing them to the three services while having little control over them. However, as the war progressed, the OKW found itself exercising increasing amounts of direct command authority over military units, particularly in the west. This created a situation such that by 1942, the OKW held the &quot;de facto&quot; command of western forces while the Army High Command directly controlled the Eastern Front. It was not until 28 April 1945 (two days before his suicide) that Hitler placed the OKH directly under the OKW, finally giving the latter full command of Germany&#x27;s armed forces.

True to his strategy of setting different parts of the Nazi bureaucracy to compete for his favor in areas where their administration overlapped, Hitler ensured there was a rivalry between the OKW and the OKH. Since most German operations during World War II were army-controlled (with support), the OKH demanded control over German military forces. Nevertheless, Hitler decided against the OKH in favor of the OKW overseeing operations in many land theaters, despite being the head of the OKH. As the war progressed, more and more influence moved from the OKH to the OKW, with Norway being the first &quot;OKW war theater&quot;. More and more areas came under complete control of the OKW. Finally, only the Eastern Front remained the domain of the OKH. However, as the Eastern Front was by far the primary battlefield of the German military, the OKH was still influential.

The OKW ran military operations on the Western front, in North Africa, and in Italy. In the west, operations were further split between the OKW and (OBW, Commander in Chief West), who was Gerd von Rundstedt (succeeded by Field Marshal Günther von Kluge).

There was even more fragmentation since the and operations had their own commands (the (OKM) and the (OKL)) which, while theoretically subordinate, were largely independent from the OKW or the OBW. Further complications in OKW operations also arose in circumstances such as when, on 19 December 1941, Hitler dismissed Walther von Brauchitsch as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, after the failure of the Battle of Moscow, and assumed von Brauchitsch&#x27;s former position, in essence reporting directly to himself, since the Commander-in-Chief of the Army reported to the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.

In Berlin and Königsberg, the German Army had large &quot;Fernschreibstelle&quot; (teleprinter offices) which collected morning messages each day from regional or local centres. They also had a &quot;Geheimschreibstube&quot; or cipher room where plaintext messages could be encrypted on Lorenz SZ40/42 machines. If sent by radio rather than landline they were intercepted and decrypted at Bletchley Park in England, where they were known as Fish. Some messages were daily returns, and some were between Hitler and his generals; both were valuable to Allied intelligence.

==International Military Tribunal==
During the Nuremberg trials, the OKW was indicted but acquitted of being a criminal organization because of Article 9 of the charter of the International Military Tribunal.

Despite this, both Keitel and Jodl were convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death by hanging.

During the subsequent High Command Trial in 1947–48, fourteen &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; officers were charged with war crimes, especially for the Commissar Order to execute Soviet political commissars in occupied territories in the east, the killing of POWs, and participation in the Holocaust. Eleven defendants received prison sentences ranging from three years, including time served, to lifetime imprisonment; two were acquitted on all counts and one committed suicide during the trial.

<text>The Academia Operosorum Labacensium (Academy of the Industrious Residents of Ljubljana) is a forerunner of the modern Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. It was founded in Ljubljana in 1693 as an association of 23 scholars. Most of the members, which included 13 lawyers, six theologians, and four medical doctors, were ethnically Slovene. The newly founded library became an important centre of activity for its members. The &quot;Operosi&quot; were very influential in the development of the arts in Ljubljana and throughout the Slovene cultural area.

The members of the academy adopted the Latin name &quot;apes&quot; (bees) and the academic tag &quot;Nobis atque aliis – operosi&quot;. Every year they held an annual meeting, as well as four other academic meetings, where they discussed their research. Its purpose from the beginning was to promote scholarship in law, medicine, philosophy, and theology.

In 1701, the academy merged with the &quot;Academia incoltorum&quot; (Academy of Fine Arts) and &quot;Academia philharmonicorum&quot; (Academy of Music). At the time of its greatest activity, around 1714, it was an international association of 42 members from Carniola and the counties of central Austria assembled under the patronage of Bishop Franz Karl von Kaunitz. It fell into decline in the summer of 1725, but was revived in 1781, thanks to the efforts of Slovene Enlightenment figures. It was only active for another 20 years or so and thereafter declined again because the members&#x27; outlooks and expectations were too much at variance.

==Presidents==
*Janez Krstnik Prešeren (1656–1704), the first president of the academy.
*Marko Gerbec, president from 1712 to 1713.

<text>Carniola ( ; ; ; ) is a historical region that comprised parts of present-day Slovenia. Although as a whole it does not exist anymore, Slovenes living within the former borders of the region still tend to identify with its traditional parts Upper Carniola, Lower Carniola (with the sub-part of White Carniola), and to a lesser degree with Inner Carniola. In 1991, 47% of the population of Slovenia lived within the borders of the former Duchy of Carniola.

==Overview==
The March of Carniola was a state of the Holy Roman Empire, established as an immediate territory in the 11th century. From the second half of the 13th century it was ruled by the Habsburgs and its capital was Ljubljana (Laibach); previous overlords had their seats in Kranj (Krainburg) and Kamnik (Stein), which are therefore sometimes referred to as its earlier capitals. In the 14th century the Duchy of Carniola was declared, a status which was formally recognised in the 16th century. As a hereditary possession of the Habsburgs (one of the so-called ), Carniola was part of the Austrian Circle of the Empire from the early 16th century. Informally it was part of Inner Austria. It was subdivided into Upper, Lower, and Inner Carniola.

In 1804 it became part of the newly established Austrian Empire and in 1806 the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved. In 1809 it was ceded to the First French Empire, becoming part of the Illyrian Provinces; it was returned to Austria in 1815, forming part of the Kingdom of Illyria. In 1849 Illyria was dissolved and Carniola became a crown land in its own right; the three traditional subdivisions were also abolished. In 1867 it became part of Cisleithania, the Austrian part of Austria-Hungary. It remained so until 1918, when it seceded as part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, becoming part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia); it ceased to exist &quot;de jure&quot; with the passing of the Vidovdan Constitution in 1921.

Nowadays, its territory (in the extent at its dissolution) is almost entirely located in Slovenia, except for a small part in Italy, around Fusine in Valromana. Carniola in its final form, established in 1815, encompassed . In 1914, before the beginning of World War I, it had a population of slightly under 530,000, of whom 95% were Slovenes.

==Geography==
The region is crossed by the Julian Alps and the Karawanks. The highest mountain peaks are Nanos, ; Vremščica, ; Snežnik, ; and Triglav, . The main rivers are the Sava, Tržič Bistrica, Kokra, Kamnik Bistrica, Sora, Ljubljanica, Mirna, Krka, and Kolpa rivers. Notable lakes include Black Lake (), Lake Bohinj, Lake Bled, and Lake Cerknica. Nearby is the Ljubljana Marsh, and a series of hot and mineral springs which can be found at Dolenjske Toplice, Šmarješke Toplice, and Izlake.

Agriculture thrived more in Upper Carniola than in Lower Carniola. The Vipava Valley was especially famous for its wine and vegetables, and for its mild climate. The average temperature was in spring, in summer, in autumn, and in winter.&lt;br&gt;

In 1910 the main railroads were the Southern, Prince Rudolf, Bohinj, Kamnik, Lower Carniola, and Vrhnika railroads. The principal cities and towns in the region were Kamnik, Kranj, Tržič, Vrhnika, Vipava, Idrija, Turjak, Ribnica, Metlika, Novo Mesto, and Vače.

==History==
===Overview===
After the fall of the Roman Empire, Lombards settled in Carniola, followed by Slavs around the sixth century AD. As a part of the Holy Roman Empire, the area was successively ruled by Bavarian, Frankish and local nobility, and eventually by the Austrian Habsburgs almost continuously from 1335 to 1918, though beset by many raids from the Ottomans and rebellions by local residents against Habsburg rule from the 15th to the 17th centuries. From about 900 AD until the 20th century, Carniola&#x27;s ruling classes and urban areas spoke German, while the peasantry spoke Slovene.

The capital of Carniola, originally located at Kranj (), was briefly moved to Kamnik () and finally to the current capital of Slovenia, Ljubljana ().

===Antiquity and Middle Ages===

Before the coming of the Romans (), the Taurisci dwelt in the north of Carniola, the Pannonians in the southeast, the Iapodes or Carni, a Celtic tribe, in the southwest.

Carniola formed part of the Roman province of Pannonia; the northern part was joined to Noricum, the south-western and south-eastern parts and the city of Aemona to Venice and Istria. In the time of Augustus all the region from Aemona to the Kolpa River (Culpa) belonged to the province of Savia.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire (476), Carniola was incorporated into Odoacer&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy, and then in 493, under Theodoric, it formed part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom. Between the upper Sava and the Soča rivers lived the Carni, and towards the end of the sixth century Slavs settled the region called by Latin writers &quot;Carnia&quot;, or &quot;Carniola&quot; meaning &#x27;little Carnia&#x27;; i.e., part of greater Carnia. The Latin name was later borrowed into Slavic, becoming &quot;Kranjska&quot;, and into German as &quot;Chrainmark, Krain&quot;.

The new inhabitants, to whom modern historiography frequently refers to as Alpine Slavs, were subjected to the Avars, but around 623 they joined the Slavic tribal union of Samo. After Samo&#x27;s death in AD 658, they fell again under the Avar rule, but most probably enjoyed partial autonomy.

===March of Carniola===
Carniola was governed by the Franks about the year 788, and was Christianized by missionaries from the Patriarchate of Aquileia and others. When Charlemagne established the margraviate of Friuli, he added to it a part of Carniola. After the division of Friuli, it became an independent margraviate, having its own Slavic margrave residing at Kranj, subject to the governor of Bavaria at first, and after 976 to the Dukes of Carinthia. Henry IV gave it to the Patriarch of Aquileia (1071) and it formed part of the Patriarchal State of Friuli.

Several sources from the High Middle Ages suggest that there was a common Carantanian (that is, Carinthian) identity that slowly vanished after the 14th century and was replaced by a regional Carniolan identity.

In the Middle Ages the Church held much property in Carniola, and thus in 974 in Upper and Lower Carniola the Bishop of Freising became in 974 a feudal lord of the town of Škofja Loka, the Bishop of Brixen held Bled and possessions in the Bohinj Valley, and the Bishop of Lavant received Mokronog.

Among secular potentates, the Dukes of Meran, Gorizia, Babenberg, and Zilli held possessions given to them in fief by the patriarchs of Aquileia. The dukes governed the province for nearly half a century.

Finally Carniola was given in fief with the consent of the patriarch to Frederick II of Austria, who obtained the title of duke in 1245. Frederick was succeeded by Ulrich III, Duke of Carinthia, who married Agnes of Andechs, a relative of the patriarch, and he endowed the churches and monasteries, established the government mint at the town of Kostanjevica, and finally (in 1268) willed to Ottokar II, King of Bohemia, all his possessions and the government of Carinthia and Carniola.

===Duchy of Carniola===
Ottokar was defeated by Rudolph I of Germany, and at the meeting at Augsburg in 1282, he gave in fief to his sons Albrecht and Rudolf the province of Carniola, but it was leased to Meinhard, count of Gorizia-Tirol. Duke Henry of Carinthia claimed Carniola; and the Dukes of Austria asserted their claim as successors to the Bohemian kingdom. When Henry died 1335 Jan, King of Bohemia, renounced his claims, and Albrecht, Duke of Austria, received Carniola; it was proclaimed a duchy by Rudolf IV, in 1364. Emperor Frederick III united Upper, Lower, and Central Carniola as Metlika and Pivka into one duchy. The union of the dismembered parts was completed by 1607.

===French Intermezzo===
French revolutionary troops occupied Carniola in 1797, and from 1805 to 1806. Under the Treaty of Vienna, Carniola became part of the Illyrian provinces of France (1809–1814), with Ljubljana as its capital, and Carniola formed a part of the new territory from 1809 to 1813.
The defeat of Napoleon restored Carniola to Austrian Emperor Francis I, with larger boundaries, but at the extinction of the Illyrian Kingdom Carniola was confined to the limits outlined at the Congress of Vienna, 1815. From 1816 to 1849 Carniola was part of the Austrian Kingdom of Illyria with capital in Ljubljana.

===Ecclesiastical history===
In early Christian times the duchy was under the jurisdiction of the metropolitans of Aquileia (who became Patriarchs), Syrmium, and Salona. In consequence of the immigration of the pagan Slovenes, this arrangement was not a lasting one. After they had embraced Christianity in the seventh and eighth centuries Charlemagne conferred the major part of Carniola on the Patriarchate of Aquileia, and the remainder on the Diocese of Trieste. In 1100 that patriarchate was divided into five archdeaconries, of which Krain was one.

The diocese of Ljubljana or Laibach was established by Emperor Frederick III on 6 December 1461. It was directly subject to the pope. This was confirmed by a Bull of Pope Pius II, 10 September 1462. The new diocese consisted of part of Upper Carniola, two parishes in Lower Carniola, and a portion of Lower Styria and Carinthia; the remaining portion of Carniola was attached to Aquileia, later on to Gorizia and Trieste. At the redistribution of dioceses (1787 to 1791) not all the parishes in Carniola were included in the Diocese of Ljubljana, but this was accomplished in 1833, by taking two deaneries from the Diocese of Trieste, one from Gorizia, and one parish from the Diocese of Lavant, so as to include all the territory within the political boundaries of the crownland.

===Austrian administration===

The Austrian Empire reorganized the territory in 1849 as a duchy and a Cisleithanian crownland in Austria-Hungary known as the Duchy of Carniola. It was bounded on the north by Carinthia, on the north-east by Styria, on the south-east and south by Croatia, and on the west by Trieste, Goritza, and Istria; with area of and population of 510,000. The capital, Ljubljana, was the see of a prince-bishop, population, 40,000; it was known to the Romans as Aemona, and was destroyed by Obri in the sixth century. Carniola was divided into Upper Carniola (Slovenian name: Gorenjska), Lower Carniola (Slovenian: Dolenjska), and Inner Carniola (Slovenian: Notranjska). Politically the province was divided into eleven districts consisting of 359 municipalities; the provincial capital was the residence of the imperial governor. The districts were: Kamnik, Kranj, Radovljica, the neighbourhood of Ljubljana, Logatec, Postojna, Litija, Krsko, Novo Mesto, Crnomelj, and Gotschee or Kocevje. There were 31 judicial circuits.

The duchy was constituted by rescript of 20 December 1860, and by imperial patent of 26 February 1861, modified by legislation of 21 December 1867, granting power to the home parliament to enact all laws not reserved to the imperial diet, at which it was represented by eleven delegates, of whom two elected by the landowners, three by the cities, towns, commercial and industrial boards, five by the village communes, and one by a fifth curia by secret ballot, every duly registered male twenty-four years of age has the right to vote. The home legislature consisted of a single chamber of thirty-seven members, among whom the prince-bishop sits ex-officio. The emperor convened the legislature, and it is presided over by the governor. The landed interests elected ten members, the cities and towns eight, the commercial and industrial boards two, the village communes sixteen. In 1907, instead of these rules, universal and equal suffrage for all men was introduced. The business of the chamber was restricted to legislating on agriculture, public and charitable institutions, administration of communes, church and school affairs, the transportation and housing of soldiers in war and during manoeuvres, and other local matters. The land budget of 1901 amounted to 3,573,280 crowns ($714,656).

===Modern era===
In 1918, the duchy ceased to exist and its territory became part of the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and subsequently part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). The western part of the duchy, with the towns of Postojna, Ilirska Bistrica, Idrija, and Šturje, was annexed to Italy in 1920, but was subsequently also included in Yugoslavia in 1947. Since 1991, the region has been part of an independent Slovenia.

<text>The Doric order is one of the three orders of ancient Greek and later Roman architecture; the other two canonical orders were the Ionic and the Corinthian. The Doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of the columns. Originating in the western Doric region of Greece, it is the earliest and, in its essence, the simplest of the orders, though still with complex details in the entablature above.

The Greek Doric column was fluted, and had no base, dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood. The capital was a simple circular form, with some mouldings, under a square cushion that is very wide in early versions, but later more restrained. Above a plain architrave, the complexity comes in the frieze, where the two features originally unique to the Doric, the triglyph and gutta, are skeuomorphic memories of the beams and retaining pegs of the wooden constructions that preceded stone Doric temples. In stone they are purely ornamental.

The relatively uncommon Roman and Renaissance Doric retained these, and often introduced thin layers of moulding or further ornament, as well as often using plain columns. More often they used versions of the Tuscan order, elaborated for nationalistic reasons by Italian Renaissance writers, which is in effect a simplified Doric, with un-fluted columns and a simpler entablature with no triglyphs or guttae. The Doric order was much used in Greek Revival architecture from the 18th century onwards; often earlier Greek versions were used, with wider columns and no bases to them.

The ancient architect and architectural historian Vitruvius associates the Doric with masculine proportions (the Ionic representing the feminine). It is also normally the cheapest of the orders to use. When the three orders are superposed, it is usual for the Doric to be at the bottom, with the Ionic and then the Corinthian above, and the Doric, as &quot;strongest&quot;, is often used on the ground floor below another order in the storey above.

==History==

===Greek===
In their original Greek version, Doric columns stood directly on the flat pavement (the &quot;stylobate&quot;) of a temple without a base. With a height only four to eight times their diameter, the columns were the most squat of all the classical orders; their vertical shafts were fluted with 20 parallel concave grooves, each rising to a sharp edge called an arris. They were topped by a smooth capital that flared from the column to meet a square abacus at the intersection with the horizontal beam (architrave) that they carried.

The Parthenon is in the Doric order, and in antiquity and subsequently has been recognized as the most perfect example of the evolved order. It was most popular in the Archaic Period (750–480 BC) in mainland Greece, and also found in Magna Graecia (southern Italy), as in the three temples at Paestum. These are in Archaic Doric, where the capitals spread wide from the column compared to later Classical forms, as exemplified in the Parthenon.

Pronounced features of both Greek and Roman versions of the Doric order are the alternating triglyphs and metopes. The triglyphs are decoratively grooved with two vertical grooves (&quot;tri-glyph&quot;) and represent the original wooden end-beams, which rest on the plain architrave that occupies the lower half of the entablature. Under each triglyph are peglike &quot;stagons&quot; or &quot;guttae&quot; (literally: drops) that appear as if they were hammered in from below to stabilize the post-and-beam (trabeated) construction. They also served to &quot;organize&quot; rainwater runoff from above. The spaces between the triglyphs are the &quot;metopes&quot;. They may be left plain, or they may be carved in low relief.
====Spacing the triglyphs====
The spacing of the triglyphs caused problems which took some time to resolve. A triglyph is centered above every column, with another (or sometimes two) between columns, though the Greeks felt that the corner triglyph should form the corner of the entablature, creating an inharmonious mismatch with the supporting column.

The architecture followed rules of harmony. Since the original design probably came from wooden temples and the triglyphs were real heads of wooden beams, every column had to bear a beam which lay across the centre of the column. Triglyphs were arranged regularly; the last triglyph was centred upon the last column (&quot;illustration, right: I.&quot;). This was regarded as the ideal solution which had to be reached.

Changing to stone cubes instead of wooden beams required full support of the architrave load at the last column. At the first temples the final triglyph was moved (&quot;illustration, right: II.), still terminating the sequence, but leaving a gap disturbing the regular order. Even worse, the last triglyph was not centered with the corresponding column. That &quot;archaic&quot; manner was not regarded as a harmonious design. The resulting problem is called the doric corner conflict. Another approach was to apply a broader corner triglyph (III.&quot;) but was not really satisfying.

Because the metopes are somewhat flexible in their proportions, the modular space between columns (&quot;intercolumniation&quot;) can be adjusted by the architect. Often the last two columns were set slightly closer together (&quot;corner contraction&quot;), to give a subtle visual strengthening to the corners. That is called the &quot;classic&quot; solution of the corner conflict (IV.). Triglyphs could be arranged in a harmonic manner again, and the corner was terminated with a triglyph, though the final triglyph and column were often not centered. Roman aesthetics did not demand that a triglyph form the corner, and filled it with a half (&quot;demi&quot;-) metope, allowing triglyphs centered over columns (&quot;illustration, right, V.&quot;).

====Temples====
There are many theories as to the origins of the Doric order in temples. The term Doric is believed to have originated from the Greek-speaking Dorian tribes. One belief is that the Doric order is the result of early wood prototypes of previous temples. With no hard proof and the sudden appearance of stone temples from one period after the other, this becomes mostly speculation. Another belief is that the Doric was inspired by the architecture of Egypt. With the Greeks being present in Ancient Egypt as soon the 7th-century BC, it is possible that Greek traders were inspired by the structures they saw in what they would consider foreign land. Finally, another theory states that the inspiration for the Doric came from Mycenae. At the ruins of this civilization lies architecture very similar to the Doric order. It is also in Greece, which would make it very accessible.
Some of the earliest examples of the Doric order come from the 7th-century BC. These examples include the Temple of Apollo at Corinth and the Temple of Zeus at Nemea. Other examples of the Doric order include the three 6th-century BC temples at Paestum in southern Italy, a region called Magna Graecia, which was settled by Greek colonists. Compared to later versions, the columns are much more massive, with a strong entasis or swelling, and wider capitals.

The Temple of the Delians is a &quot;peripteral&quot; Doric order temple, the largest of three dedicated to Apollo on the island of Delos. It was begun in 478 BC and never completely finished. During their period of independence from Athens, the Delians reassigned the temple to the island of Poros. It is &quot;hexastyle&quot;, with six columns across the pedimented end and thirteen along each long face. All the columns are centered under a triglyph in the frieze, except for the corner columns. The plain, unfluted shafts on the columns stand directly on the platform (the &quot;stylobate&quot;), without bases. The recessed &quot;necking&quot; in the nature of fluting at the top of the shafts and the wide cushionlike echinus may be interpreted as slightly self-conscious archaising features, for Delos is Apollo&#x27;s ancient birthplace. However, the similar fluting at the base of the shafts might indicate an intention for the plain shafts to be capable of wrapping in drapery.

A classic statement of the Greek Doric order is the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, built about 447 BC. The contemporary Parthenon, the largest temple in classical Athens, is also in the Doric order, although the sculptural enrichment is more familiar in the Ionic order: the Greeks were never as doctrinaire in the use of the Classical vocabulary as Renaissance theorists or Neoclassical architects. The detail, part of the basic vocabulary of trained architects from the later 18th century onwards, shows how the width of the metopes was flexible: here they bear the famous sculptures including the battle of Lapiths and Centaurs.
===Roman===
In the Roman Doric version, the height of the entablature has been reduced. The endmost triglyph is centered over the column rather than occupying the corner of the architrave. The columns are slightly less robust in their proportions. Below their caps, an astragal molding encircles the column like a ring. Crown moldings soften transitions between frieze and cornice and emphasize the upper edge of the abacus, which is the upper part of the capital.

Roman Doric columns also have moldings at their bases and stand on low square pads or are even raised on plinths. In the Roman Doric mode, columns are not usually fluted; indeed, fluting is rare. Since the Romans did not insist on a triglyph covered corner, now both columns and triglyphs could be arranged equidistantly again and centered together. The architrave corner needed to be left &quot;blank&quot;, which is sometimes referred to as a half, or &quot;demi-&quot;, metope (&quot;illustration, V., in Spacing the Columns above&quot;).

The Roman architect Vitruvius, following contemporary practice, outlined in his treatise the procedure for laying out constructions based on a module, which he took to be one half a column&#x27;s diameter, taken at the base. An illustration of Andrea Palladio&#x27;s Doric order, as it was laid out, with modules identified, by Isaac Ware, in &quot;The Four Books of Palladio&#x27;s Architecture&quot; (London, 1738) is illustrated at Vitruvian module.

According to Vitruvius, the height of Doric columns is six or seven times the diameter at the base. This gives the Doric columns a shorter, thicker look than Ionic columns, which have 8:1 proportions. It is suggested that these proportions give the Doric columns a masculine appearance, whereas the more slender Ionic columns appear to represent a more feminine look. This sense of masculinity and femininity was often used to determine which type of column would be used for a particular structure.

Later periods reviving classical architecture used the Roman Doric until Neoclassical architecture arrived in the later 18th century. This followed the first good illustrations and measured descriptions of Greek Doric buildings. The most influential, and perhaps the earliest, use of the Doric in Renaissance architecture was in the circular &quot;Tempietto&quot; by Donato Bramante (1502 or later), in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio, Rome.

===Modern===

Before Greek Revival architecture grew, initially in England, in the 18th century, the Greek or elaborated Roman Doric order had not been very widely used, though &quot;Tuscan&quot; types of round capitals were always popular, especially in less formal buildings. It was sometimes used in military contexts, for example the Royal Hospital Chelsea (1682 onwards, by Christopher Wren). The first engraved illustrations of the Greek Doric order dated to the mid-18th century. Its appearance in the new phase of Classicism brought with it new connotations of high-minded primitive simplicity, seriousness of purpose, noble sobriety.

In Germany it suggested a contrast with the French, and in the United States republican virtues. In a customs house, Greek Doric suggested incorruptibility; in a Protestant church a Greek Doric porch promised a return to an untainted early church; it was equally appropriate for a library, a bank or a trustworthy public utility. The revived Doric did not return to Sicily until 1789, when a French architect researching the ancient Greek temples designed an entrance to the Botanical Gardens in Palermo.

<text>A multi-sport event is an organized sporting event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports among organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation-states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance was the Olympic Games, first held in modern times in 1896 in Athens, Greece, and inspired by the Ancient Olympic Games, one of a number of such events held in antiquity. Most modern multi-sport events have the same basic structure. Games are held over the 
course of several days in and around a &quot;host city&quot;, which changes for each competition. Countries send national teams to each competition, consisting of individual athletes and teams that compete in a wide variety of sports. Athletes or teams are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for first, second and third place respectively. Each game is generally held every four years, though some are annual competitions.

== History ==
The Ancient Olympic Games, first held in 776 BC, was the precursor to the Modern Olympic Games, although its first edition only featured a footrace and the number of sporting competitions expanded at later editions.

There were several other &quot;games&quot; held in Europe in the classical era:

* Panhellenic Games:
** &quot;The Pythian Games&quot; (founded 527 BC) held in Delphi every four years
** &quot;The Nemean Games&quot; (founded 516 BC) held in Argolid every two years
** &quot;The Isthmian Games&quot; (founded 523 BC) held on the Isthmus of Corinth every two years
* The Roman Games – Arising from Etruscan rather than purely Greek roots, the Roman Games deemphasized footraces and throwing. Instead, the Greek sports of chariot racing and wrestling, as well as the Etruscan sport of gladiatorial combat, took center stage.

Other multi-sport festivals emerged in the Middle Ages in Europe, including the Cotswold Olimpick Games in England in the 1600s, the Highland Games in Scotland, and the Olympiade de la République in France in the 1800s.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, athletes at multi-sport events were almost exclusively male. As international women&#x27;s sport began to develop, events such as the Women&#x27;s World Games and Olympics of Grace were held to allow women to engage in sport on the international stage. Though short-lived, events such as these led to greater inclusion of women at multi-sport events over the course of the 20th century.

Although the modern tradition commemorates the 1921 revolution, the Naadam festival in Mongolia is a continuation of ancient sporting practises amongst Mongolians. The three events of wrestling, horse racing and archery are thought to date back centuries and represent the three most important pursuits of a strong man in nomadic society. Alongside these sporting events there are other cultural activities such as dances and parades.

== Audience ==
Since the establishment of the Olympics, most serial multi-sport events have been organized for specific audiences and participating countries or communities. These affiliations include:

* Regional, such as the Asian Games and the Pan-American Games
* Sub-Regional, such as the South Asian Games, Southeast Asian Games and the South American Games
* Political, such as the Spartakiad and the Games of the New Emerging Forces (GANEFO)
* Historic or historic cultural roots, such as the Commonwealth Games (for members of the Commonwealth of Nations) the Jeux de la Francophonie (for members of La Francophonie) and the Lusophone Games (for members of Community of Portuguese Language Countries)
* Ethnocultural or ethnoreligious, such as the Pan-Armenian Games (for ethnic communities of Armenians both in Armenia and in other countries) and the Maccabiah Games (for communities of Jews of both ethnic and religious origins)
* Religious, such as the Islamic Solidarity Games and the previously mentioned Maccabiah Games
* Occupational, such as the Military World Games, the World Police and Fire Games, and the Universiade
* Physical disabilities, such as the Paralympics and the Deaflympics
* Intellectual disabilities, such as the Special Olympics World Games
* Age, such as the World Masters Games, Commonwealth Youth Games, and the Senior Olympics
* Gender and sexual orientation, such as the Women&#x27;s Islamic Games and the Gay Games

==Historic events==

===Olympic Games===
The first modern multi-sport event organised were the Olympic Games, organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) (est. 1894) for the first time in 1896 in Athens, Greece. After some celebrations (1900, 1904), the Olympics became very popular nowadays. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing.

===Paralympic Games===
The Paralympic Games is the largest multi-sport event involving athletes with physical disabilities and is organized by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Arranged for the first time in 1960 in Rome, Italy. The number of sports, initially only a few, is still growing.

===Special Olympics===
The first Special Olympics International Summer Games were held in Chicago, Illinois, in 1968. The most recent Special Olympics World Winter Games in Schladming, Austria involved 25 sports and approximately 2,277 athletes from 133 countries. 

===Others===
At the beginning of the 20th century, another multi-sport event, the Nordic Games were first held. These Games were held in Scandinavia, and the sports conducted were winter sports such as cross-country skiing and speed skating. The Nordic Games were last held in 1926, after which the 1924 Winter Sports Week in Chamonix was declared the first Olympic Winter Games.
In the 1920s, all kinds of other multi-sport events were set up. These were usually directed for a selected group of athletes, rather than everybody, which was the case with the Olympic Games. The Soviets organized the first Spartakiad in 1920, a communist alternative to the &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; Olympic Games, and in 1922 the University Olympia was organizedor in Italy, the forerunner of the World University Games, meant for students only.
Regional games were another kind of multi-sport event that was established, such as the Far Eastern Championship Games (1913), the Central American and Caribbean Games (1926) or the Pan American Games (1951).

<text>The Night of the Long Knives (, ), also called the Röhm purge or Operation Hummingbird (), was a purge that took place in Nazi Germany from 30 June to 2 July 1934. Chancellor Adolf Hitler, urged on by Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler, ordered a series of political extrajudicial executions intended to consolidate his power and alleviate the concerns of the German military about the role of Ernst Röhm and the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), the Nazis&#x27; paramilitary organization, known colloquially as &quot;Brownshirts&quot;. Nazi propaganda presented the murders as a preventive measure against an alleged imminent coup by the SA under Röhm – the so-called &quot;Röhm Putsch&quot;.

The primary instruments of Hitler&#x27;s action were the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) paramilitary force under Himmler and its Security Service (SD), and Gestapo (secret police) under Reinhard Heydrich, which between them carried out most of the killings. Göring&#x27;s personal police battalion also took part. Many of those killed in the purge were leaders of the SA, the best-known being Röhm himself, the SA&#x27;s chief of staff and one of Hitler&#x27;s longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the Strasserist faction of the Nazi Party, including its leader Gregor Strasser, were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Bavarian politician Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who had helped suppress Hitler&#x27;s Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The murders of SA leaders were also intended to improve the image of the Hitler government with a German public that was increasingly critical of thuggish SA tactics.

Hitler saw the independence of the SA and the penchant of its members for street violence as a direct threat to his newly gained political power. He also wanted to appease leaders of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, the German military, who feared and despised the SA as a potential rival, in particular because of Röhm&#x27;s ambition to merge the army and the SA under his own leadership. Additionally, Hitler was uncomfortable with Röhm&#x27;s outspoken support for a &quot;second revolution&quot; to redistribute wealth. In Röhm&#x27;s view, President Paul von Hindenburg&#x27;s appointment of Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933 had brought the Nazi Party to power, but had left unfulfilled the party&#x27;s larger goals. Finally, Hitler used the purge to attack or eliminate German critics of his new regime, especially those loyal to Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, as well as to settle scores with enemies.

At least 85 people died during the purge, although the final death toll may have been in the hundreds, with high estimates running from 700 to 1,000. More than 1,000 perceived opponents were arrested. The purge strengthened and consolidated the support of the military for Hitler. It also provided a legal grounding for the Nazis, as the German courts and cabinet quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against extrajudicial killings to demonstrate their loyalty to the regime. The Night of the Long Knives was a turning point for the German government. It established Hitler as the supreme administrator of justice of the German people, as he put it in his 13 July speech to the Reichstag.

==Hitler and the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA)==
President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933. Over the following few months, during the so-called &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;, Hitler dispensed with the need for the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic as a legislative body and eliminated all rival political parties in Germany, so that by the middle of 1933 the country had become a one-party state under his direction and control. Hitler did not exercise absolute power, however, despite his swift consolidation of political authority. As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a highly respected veteran field marshal. While many officers were impressed by Hitler&#x27;s promises of an expanded army, a return to conscription, and a more aggressive foreign policy, the army continued to guard its traditions of independence during the early years of the Nazi regime.

To a lesser extent, the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), a Nazi paramilitary organization, remained somewhat autonomous within the party. The SA evolved out of the remnants of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; movement of the post-World War I years. The &quot;Freikorps&quot; were nationalistic organizations primarily composed of disaffected, disenchanted, and angry German combat veterans utilized by the government in January 1919 to deal with the threat of a Communist revolution when it appeared that there was a lack of loyal troops. A very large number of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; believed that the November Revolution had betrayed them when Germany was alleged to be on the verge of victory in 1918. Hence, the &quot;Freikorps&quot; were in opposition to the new Weimar Republic, which was born as a result of the November Revolution, and whose founders were contemptuously called &quot;November criminals&quot;. Captain Ernst Röhm of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; served as the liaison with the Bavarian Freikorps. Röhm was given the nickname &quot;The Machine Gun King of Bavaria&quot; in the early 1920s, since he was responsible for storing and issuing illegal machine guns to the Bavarian Freikorps units. Röhm left the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; in 1923 and later became commander of the SA. During the 1920s and 1930s, the SA functioned as a private militia used by Hitler to intimidate rivals and disrupt the meetings of competing political parties, especially those of the Social Democrats and the Communists. Also known as the &quot;brownshirts&quot; or &quot;stormtroopers&quot;, the SA became notorious for their street battles with the Communists. The violent confrontations between the two contributed to the destabilization of the Weimar Republic. In June 1932, one of the worst months of political violence, there were more than 400 street battles, resulting in 82 deaths.

Hitler&#x27;s appointment as chancellor, followed by the suppression of all political parties except the Nazis, did not end the violence of the stormtroopers. Deprived of Communist party meetings to disrupt, the stormtroopers would sometimes run riot in the streets after a night of drinking; they would attack passers-by and then attack the police who were called to stop them. Complaints of &quot;overbearing and loutish&quot; behaviour by stormtroopers became common by the middle of 1933. The Foreign Office even complained of instances where brownshirts manhandled foreign diplomats

On 6 July 1933, at a gathering of high-ranking Nazi officials, Hitler declared the success of the National Socialist, or Nazi, seizure of power. Now that the Nazi Party had seized the reins of power in Germany, he said, it was time to consolidate its control. Hitler told the gathered officials, &quot;The stream of revolution has been undammed, but it must be channelled into the secure bed of evolution.&quot;

Hitler&#x27;s speech signalled his intention to rein in the SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. Hitler&#x27;s task would not be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism&#x27;s most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively – or even primarily – a working-class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.

The action Hitler took would not only defang Röhm and the SA as a potential threat to Hitler&#x27;s personal control of the Nazi Party, but would also serve to strengthen his relationship with the Wehrmacht – the German armed forces – which had long considered the SA to be their primary rival, the SA at times outnumbering the military in manpower.

The supporters of Ernst Röhm (Röhm-cult), like the Strasserists, formed one of the ideological factions of the Nazi Party at that time.

==Conflict between the army and the SA==
No one in the SA spoke more loudly for &quot;a continuation of the German revolution&quot; (as one prominent stormtrooper, Edmund Heines, put it) than Röhm himself. Röhm, as one of the earliest members of the Nazi Party, had participated in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt by Hitler to seize power by force in 1923. A combat veteran of World War I, Röhm had recently boasted that he would execute 12 men in retaliation for the killing of any stormtrooper. Röhm saw violence as a means to political ends.

Not content solely with the leadership of the SA, Röhm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by the conservative General Werner von Blomberg. Although nicknamed the &quot;Rubber Lion&quot; by some of his critics in the army for his devotion to Hitler, Blomberg was not a Nazi, and therefore represented a bridge between the army and the party. Blomberg and many of his fellow officers were recruited from the Prussian nobility and regarded the SA as a plebeian rabble that threatened the army&#x27;s traditional high status in German society.

If the regular army showed contempt for the masses belonging to the SA, many stormtroopers returned the feeling, seeing the army as insufficiently committed to the National Socialist dictatorship. Max Heydebreck, an SA leader in Rummelsburg, denounced the army to his fellow brownshirts, telling them, &quot;Some of the officers of the army are swine. Most officers are too old and have to be replaced by young ones. We want to wait till Papa Hindenburg is dead, and then the SA will march against the army.&quot;

Despite such hostility between the brownshirts and the regular army, Blomberg and others in the military saw the SA as a source of raw recruits for an enlarged and revitalized army. Röhm, however, wanted to eliminate the generalship of the Prussian aristocracy altogether, using the SA to become the core of a new German military. With the army limited by the Treaty of Versailles to one hundred thousand soldiers, its leaders watched anxiously as membership in the SA surpassed three million men by the beginning of 1934. In January 1934, Röhm presented Blomberg with a memorandum demanding that the SA replace the regular army as the nation&#x27;s ground forces, and that the Reichswehr become a training adjunct to the SA.

In response, Hitler met Blomberg and the leadership of the SA and SS on 28 February 1934. Under pressure from Hitler, Röhm reluctantly signed a pledge stating that he recognised the supremacy of the Reichswehr over the SA. Hitler announced to those present that the SA would act as an auxiliary to the Reichswehr, not the other way around. After Hitler and most of the army officers had left, however, Röhm declared that he would not take instructions from &quot;the ridiculous corporal&quot; – a demeaning reference to Hitler. While Hitler did not take immediate action against Röhm for his intemperate outburst, it nonetheless deepened the rift between them.

==Growing pressure against the SA==
Despite his earlier agreement with Hitler, Röhm still clung to his vision of a new German army with the SA at its core. By early 1934, this vision directly conflicted with Hitler&#x27;s plan to consolidate power and expand the Reichswehr. Because their plans for the army conflicted, Röhm&#x27;s success could come only at Hitler&#x27;s expense. Moreover, it was not just the Reichswehr that viewed the SA as a threat. Several of Hitler&#x27;s lieutenants feared Röhm&#x27;s growing power and restlessness, as did Hitler. As a result, a political struggle within the party grew, with those closest to Hitler, including Prussian premier Hermann Göring, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler, and Hitler&#x27;s deputy Rudolf Hess, positioning themselves against Röhm. While all of these men were veterans of the Nazi movement, only Röhm continued to demonstrate his independence from, rather than his loyalty to, Adolf Hitler. Röhm&#x27;s contempt for the party&#x27;s bureaucracy angered Hess. SA violence in Prussia gravely concerned Göring.

Finally, in early 1934, the growing rift between Röhm and Hitler over the role of the SA in the Nazi state led former chancellor General Kurt von Schleicher to start playing politics again. Schleicher criticized the current Hitler cabinet, while some of Schleicher&#x27;s followers such as General Ferdinand von Bredow and Werner von Alvensleben started passing along lists of a new Hitler cabinet in which Schleicher would become vice-chancellor, Röhm minister of defence, Heinrich Brüning foreign minister and Gregor Strasser minister of national economy. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, who knew Schleicher and his circle well, wrote that Bredow displayed a &quot;lack of discretion&quot; that was &quot;terrifying&quot; as he went about showing the list of the proposed cabinet to anyone who was interested. Although Schleicher was in fact unimportant by 1934, increasingly wild rumours that he was scheming with Röhm to re-enter the corridors of power helped stoke the sense of crisis.

As a means of isolating Röhm, on 20 April 1934, Göring transferred control of the Prussian political police (Gestapo) to Himmler, who, Göring believed, could be counted on to move against Röhm. Himmler named his deputy Reinhard Heydrich to head the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Himmler envied the independence and power of the SA, although by this time he and Heydrich had already begun restructuring the SS from a bodyguard formation for Nazi leaders (and a subset of the SA) into its own independent elite corps, one loyal to both himself and Hitler. The loyalty of the SS men would prove useful to both when Hitler finally chose to move against Röhm and the SA. By May, lists of those to be &quot;liquidated&quot; started to circulate amongst Göring and Himmler&#x27;s people, who engaged in a trade, adding enemies of one in exchange for sparing friends of the other. At the end of May Brüning and Schleicher, two former chancellors, received warnings from friends in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; that their lives were in danger and they should leave Germany at once. Brüning fled to the Netherlands while Schleicher dismissed the tip-off as a bad practical joke. By the beginning of June everything was set and all that was needed was permission from Hitler.
Demands for Hitler to constrain the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure to reduce the influence of the SA and to move against Röhm. While Röhm&#x27;s homosexuality did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to do when he left for Venice to meet Benito Mussolini on 15 June. Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary Otto Meißner, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath ordered the German Ambassador to Italy Ulrich von Hassell – without Hitler&#x27;s knowledge – to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was blackening Germany&#x27;s good name. Neurath&#x27;s manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well). During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler&#x27;s good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the June 1924 kidnapping and murder of Italian socialist politician Giacomo Matteotti as an example of the kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator. While Mussolini&#x27;s criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.

On 17 June 1934, conservative demands for Hitler to act came to a head when Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, confidant of the ailing Hindenburg, gave a speech at Marburg University warning of the threat of a &quot;second revolution&quot;. According to his memoirs, von Papen, a Catholic aristocrat with ties to army and industry, privately threatened to resign if Hitler did not act. While von Papen&#x27;s resignation as vice-chancellor would not have threatened Hitler&#x27;s position, it would have nonetheless been an embarrassing display of independence from a leading conservative.

==Heydrich and Himmler==
In response to conservative pressure to constrain Röhm, Hitler left for Neudeck to meet with Hindenburg. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the president, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler for not having moved against Röhm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring martial law and turning the government over to the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; if Hitler did not take immediate steps against Röhm and his brownshirts. Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against Röhm, in part due to Röhm&#x27;s visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. The threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying Röhm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and Göring welcomed Hitler&#x27;s decision, since both had much to gain by Röhm&#x27;s downfall – the independence of the SS for Himmler and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for Göring.

In preparation for the purge, both Himmler and Heydrich assembled a dossier of manufactured evidence to suggest that Röhm had been paid (EUR in 2025) by France to overthrow Hitler. Leading officers in the SS were shown falsified evidence on 24 June that Röhm planned to use the SA to launch a plot against the government (). At Hitler&#x27;s direction, Göring, Himmler, Heydrich, and Victor Lutze drew up lists of people in and outside the SA to be killed. One of the men Göring recruited to assist him was Willi Lehmann, a Gestapo official and NKVD spy. On 25 June, General Werner von Fritsch placed the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; on the highest level of alert. On 27 June, Hitler moved to secure the army&#x27;s cooperation. Blomberg and General Walther von Reichenau, the army&#x27;s liaison to the party, gave it to him by expelling Röhm from the German Officers&#x27; League. On 28 June Hitler went to Essen to attend the wedding celebration and reception of Josef Terboven; from there he called Röhm&#x27;s adjutant at Bad Wiessee and ordered SA leaders to meet with him on 30 June at 11:00. On 29 June, a signed article in &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; by Blomberg appeared in which Blomberg stated with great fervour that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; stood behind Hitler.

==Purge==
At about 04:30 on 30 June 1934, Hitler and his entourage flew to Munich. From the airport they drove to the Bavarian Interior Ministry, where they assembled the leaders of an SA rampage that had taken place in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the epaulets off the shirt of SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery. Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst Röhm and his followers were staying.

With Hitler&#x27;s arrival in Bad Wiessee between 06:00 and 07:00, the SA leadership, still in bed, were taken by surprise. SS men stormed the hotel, and Hitler personally placed Röhm and other high-ranking SA leaders under arrest.

The SS found Breslau SA leader Edmund Heines in bed with an unidentified eighteen-year-old male SA senior troop leader. Hitler ordered both Heines and his partner taken outside the hotel and shot. Goebbels emphasised this aspect in subsequent propaganda justifying the purge as a crackdown on moral turpitude. Meanwhile, the SS arrested the other SA leaders as they left their train for the planned meeting with Röhm and Hitler.

Although Hitler presented no evidence of a plot by Röhm to overthrow the regime, he nevertheless denounced the leadership of the SA. Arriving back at party headquarters in Munich, Hitler addressed the assembled crowd. Consumed with rage, Hitler denounced &quot;the worst treachery in world history&quot;. Hitler told the crowd that &quot;undisciplined and disobedient characters and asocial or diseased elements&quot; would be annihilated. The crowd, which included party members and many SA members fortunate enough to escape arrest, shouted its approval. Hess, present among the assembled, even volunteered to shoot the &quot;traitors&quot;. Joseph Goebbels, who had been with Hitler at Bad Wiessee, set the final phase of the plan in motion. Upon returning to Berlin, Goebbels telephoned Göring at 10:00 with the codeword to let loose the execution squads on the rest of their unsuspecting victims. Sepp Dietrich received orders from Hitler for the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; to form an &quot;execution squad&quot; and go to Stadelheim Prison where certain SA leaders were being held. There in the prison courtyard, the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; firing squad shot five SA generals and an SA colonel. Those not immediately executed were taken back to the &quot;Leibstandarte&quot; barracks at Lichterfelde, given one-minute &quot;trials&quot;, and shot by a firing squad.

===Against conservatives and old enemies===


The regime did not limit itself to a purge of the SA. Having earlier imprisoned or exiled prominent Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on Göring&#x27;s personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen&#x27;s secretary Herbert von Bose without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen&#x27;s close associate Edgar Jung, the author of Papen&#x27;s Marburg speech, and disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch. The Gestapo also murdered Erich Klausener, the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate. Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests that he could not be arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor. Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticize the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.

Hitler and Himmler unleashed the Gestapo against old enemies, as well. Both Kurt von Schleicher, Hitler&#x27;s predecessor as Chancellor, and his wife were murdered at their home. Others killed included Gregor Strasser, a former Nazi who had angered Hitler by resigning from the party in 1932, and Gustav Ritter von Kahr, the former Bavarian state commissioner who had helped crush the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The murdered included at least one accidental victim: Willi Schmid, the music critic of the newspaper, whose name was confused with one of the Gestapo&#x27;s intended targets. As Himmler&#x27;s adjutant Karl Wolff later explained, friendship and personal loyalty were not allowed to stand in the way:

Some SA members died saying &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; because they believed that an anti-Hitler SS plot had led to their execution. Several leaders of the disbanded Catholic Centre Party were also murdered in the purge. The Party had generally been aligned with the Social Democrats and Catholic Church during the rise of Nazism, being critical of Nazi ideology, but voting nonetheless for the Enabling Act of 1933 which granted Hitler dictatorial authority.

Kurt Lüdecke, a party associate of Röhm, was imprisoned but escaped after eight months in a concentration camp. He later wrote &quot;I Knew Hitler: The Story of a Nazi Who Escaped the Blood-Purge,&quot; published in 1937 by Scribners of New York, United States.

===Röhm&#x27;s fate===
Röhm was held briefly at Stadelheim Prison in Munich, while Hitler considered his future. On 1 July, at Hitler&#x27;s behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michael Lippert visited Röhm. Once inside Röhm&#x27;s cell, they handed him a Browning pistol loaded with a single cartridge and told him he had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him. Röhm demurred, telling them, &quot;If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself.&quot; Having heard nothing in the allotted time, they returned to Röhm&#x27;s cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot Röhm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for Röhm&#x27;s murder. Until then, Lippert had been one of the few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.

==Aftermath==

Given that the purge claimed the lives of so many prominent Germans, it could hardly be kept secret. At first, its architects seemed split on how to handle the event. Göring instructed police stations to burn &quot;all documents concerning the action of the past two days&quot;. Meanwhile, Goebbels tried to prevent newspapers from publishing lists of the dead, but at the same time used a 2 July radio address to describe how Hitler had narrowly prevented Röhm from overthrowing the government and throwing the country into turmoil. Then, on 13 July 1934, Hitler justified the purge in a nationally broadcast speech to the Reichstag:

Wanting to present the massacre as legally sanctioned, Hitler had the cabinet approve a measure on 3 July that declared, &quot;The measures taken on June 30, July 1 and 2 to suppress treasonous assaults are legal as acts of self-defence by the State.&quot; Reich Justice Minister Franz Gürtner, a conservative who had been Bavarian Justice Minister in the years of the Weimar Republic, demonstrated his loyalty to the new regime by drafting the statute, which added a legal veneer to the purge. Signed into law by Hitler, Gürtner, and Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, the &quot;Law Regarding Measures of State Self-Defence&quot; retroactively legalized the murders committed during the purge. Germany&#x27;s legal establishment further capitulated to the regime when the country&#x27;s leading legal scholar, Carl Schmitt, wrote an article defending Hitler&#x27;s 13 July speech. It was named &quot;Der Führer schützt das Recht&quot; (&quot;The Führer Upholds the Law&quot;).

A special fund administered by SS General Franz Breithaupt was set up for the relatives of the murdered, from which they were cared for at the expense of the state. The widows of the murdered SA leaders received between 1,000 and 1,600 marks a month, depending on the rank of the murdered person. Kurt von Schleicher&#x27;s stepdaughter received 250 marks per month up to the age of 21, and the son of General von Bredow received a monthly allowance of 150 marks.

===Reaction===

The army almost unanimously applauded the Night of the Long Knives, even though the generals Kurt von Schleicher and Ferdinand von Bredow were among the victims. A telegram purportedly from the ailing Hindenburg, Germany&#x27;s highly revered military hero, expressed his &quot;profoundly felt gratitude&quot;, and congratulated Hitler for &quot;nipping treason in the bud&quot;, although Hermann Göring later admitted during the Nuremberg trials that the telegram was never seen by Hindenburg, and was actually written by the Nazis. General von Reichenau went so far as to publicly give credence to the lie that Schleicher had been plotting to overthrow the government. In his speech to the Reichstag on 13 July justifying his actions, Hitler denounced Schleicher for conspiring with Röhm to overthrow the government; Hitler alleged both were traitors working in the pay of France. Since Schleicher was a good friend of the French Ambassador André François-Poncet, and because of his reputation for intrigue, the claim that Schleicher was working for France had enough surface plausibility for most Germans to accept it. François-Poncet was not declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; as would have been usual if an ambassador were involved in a plot against his host government.

The army&#x27;s support for the purge, however, would have far-reaching consequences for the institution. The humbling of the SA ended the threat it had posed to the army, but, by standing by Hitler during the purge, the army bound itself more tightly to the Nazi regime. One retired captain, Erwin Planck, seemed to realize this: &quot;If you look on without lifting a finger&quot;, he said to his friend, General Werner von Fritsch, &quot;you will meet the same fate sooner or later.&quot; Another rare exception was Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who spoke about the murders of Schleicher and Bredow at the annual General Staff Society meeting in February 1935 after they had been rehabilitated by Hitler in early January 1935.

Rumours about the Night of the Long Knives rapidly spread. Although many Germans approached the official news of the events as described by Joseph Goebbels with a great deal of scepticism, many others took the regime at its word, and believed that Hitler had saved Germany from a descent into chaos. Luise Solmitz, a Hamburg schoolteacher, echoed the sentiments of many Germans when she cited Hitler&#x27;s &quot;personal courage, decisiveness and effectiveness&quot; in her private diary. She even compared him to Frederick the Great, the 18th-century king of Prussia.

Others were appalled at the scale of the executions and at the relative complacency of many of their fellow Germans. &quot;A very calm and easy going mailman,&quot; the diarist Victor Klemperer wrote, &quot;who is not at all National Socialist, said, &#x27;Well, he simply &quot;sentenced&quot; them.&#x27;&quot; It did not escape Klemperer&#x27;s notice that many of the victims had played a role in bringing Hitler to power. &quot;A chancellor&quot;, he wrote, &quot;sentences and shoots members of his own private army!&quot; The extent of the massacre and the relative ubiquity of the Gestapo, however, meant that those who disapproved of the purge generally kept quiet about it.

Among the few exceptions were General Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord and Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who started a campaign to have Schleicher rehabilitated by Hitler. Hammerstein, who was a close friend of Schleicher, had been much offended at Schleicher&#x27;s funeral when the SS refused to allow him to attend the service and confiscated the wreaths that the mourners had brought. Besides working for the rehabilitation of Schleicher and Bredow, Hammerstein and Mackensen sent a memo to Hindenburg on 18 July setting out in considerable detail the circumstances of the murders of the two generals and noted that Papen had barely escaped. The memo went on to demand that Hindenburg punish those responsible, and criticized Blomberg for his outspoken support of the murders of Schleicher and Bredow. Finally, Hammerstein and Mackensen asked that Hindenburg reorganize the government by firing Baron Konstantin von Neurath, Robert Ley, Hermann Göring, Werner von Blomberg, Joseph Goebbels and Richard Walther Darré from the Cabinet. The memo asked that Hindenburg instead create a directorate to rule Germany, comprising the Chancellor (who was not named), General Werner von Fritsch as Vice-Chancellor, Hammerstein as Minister of Defense, the Minister for National Economy (also unnamed), and Rudolf Nadolny as Foreign Minister. The request that Neurath be replaced by Nadolny, the former Ambassador to the USSR, who had resigned earlier that year in protest against Hitler&#x27;s anti-Soviet foreign policy, indicated that Hammerstein and Mackensen wanted a return to the &quot;distant friendliness&quot; towards the Soviet Union that existed until 1933. Mackensen and Hammerstein ended their memo with:

Hindenburg never responded to the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is noteworthy that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom they wanted to see continue as Chancellor; they at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler&#x27;s more radical followers.

In late 1934–early 1935, Werner von Fritsch and Werner von Blomberg, who had been shamed into joining Hammerstein and Mackensen&#x27;s rehabilitation campaign, successfully pressured Hitler into rehabilitating Generals von Schleicher and von Bredow. Fritsch and Blomberg suddenly now claimed at the end of 1934 that as army officers they could not stand the exceedingly violent press attacks on Schleicher and Bredow that had been going on since July, which portrayed them as the vilest traitors, working against the Fatherland in the pay of France. In a speech given on 3 January 1935, at the Berlin State Opera, Hitler stated that Schleicher and Bredow had been shot &quot;in error&quot; on the basis of false information, and that their names were to be restored to the honour rolls of their regiments at once. Hitler&#x27;s speech was not reported in the German press, but the army was appeased by the speech. However, despite the rehabilitation of the two murdered officers, the Nazis continued in private to accuse Schleicher of high treason. During a trip to Warsaw in January 1935, Göring told Jan Szembek that Schleicher had urged Hitler in January 1933 to reach an understanding with France and the Soviet Union, and partition Poland with the latter, and Hitler had Schleicher killed out of disgust with the alleged advice. During a meeting with Polish Ambassador Józef Lipski on 22 May 1935, Hitler told Lipski that Schleicher was &quot;rightfully murdered, if only because he had sought to maintain the Rapallo Treaty.&quot; The statements that Schleicher had been killed because he wanted to partition Poland with the Soviet Union were later published in the Polish White Book of 1939, which was a collection of diplomatic documents detailing German–Polish relations up to the outbreak of the war.

Former Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was in exile in Doorn, Netherlands, was horrified by the purge. He asked, &quot;What would people have said if I had done such a thing?&quot; Hearing of the murder of former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and his wife, he also commented, &quot;We have ceased to live under the rule of law and everyone must be prepared for the possibility that the Nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall!&quot;

==SA leadership==
Hitler named Viktor Lutze to replace Röhm as head of the SA. Hitler ordered him, as one prominent historian described it, to put an end to &quot;homosexuality, debauchery, drunkenness, and high living&quot; in the SA. Hitler expressly told him to stop SA funds from being spent on limousines and banquets, which he considered evidence of SA extravagance. Lutze did little to assert the SA&#x27;s independence in the coming years, and the organization lost its power in Germany. Its membership plummeted from 2.9 million in August 1934 to 1.2 million in April 1938.

According to Albert Speer, &quot;the Right, represented by the President, the Minister of Justice, and the generals, lined up behind Hitler ... the strong left wing of the party, represented chiefly by the SA, was eliminated.&quot;

Röhm was purged from all Nazi propaganda, such as &quot;The Victory of Faith&quot;, the Leni Riefenstahl film about the 1933 Nuremberg rally, which showed Röhm frequently alongside Hitler. A copy of the original film, before Röhm was edited out, was found in the 1980s in the German Democratic Republic&#x27;s film archives.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;long knives&quot; as a metonym for treachery and violence had been used to describe the Treason of the Long Knives since this incident was recorded in the 9th century Historia Brittonum. This event reputedly occurred during the fifth century Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, when Vortigern and the British leaders were invited to discuss peace and the Saxon leader Hengist commanded his men to draw their Seax (the infamous long knives) and massacre the unarmed Britons. It would become known in Welsh as &quot;twyll y cyllyll hirion&quot; () (first recorded around 1587) and in English as the &quot;Treachery/Plot/Treason of the long knives&quot; (recorded around 1604). This story would be popularized across western Europe in the 12th century as part of the &quot;History of the Britons&quot; by Geoffrey of Monmouth, which introduced many of the Arthurian legends to Germany.

In the years preceding the purge, the term &quot;long knives&quot; had become a popular description of treachery in Germany and was used as a criticism of Nazi actions and deceitfulness.

However, the term was soon adopted by the Nazis themselves to invoke what they saw as justifiable and necessary measures taken by Germanic peoples against an enemy. In 1928, the popular Nazi song &quot;Wetzt die langen Messer&quot; () encourages the mass murder of Jews and the desecration of synagogues. The Nazi adoption of the phrase for an upcoming violent event was well known even to the foreign press, with the 2 August 1932 issue of &quot;The Times&quot; reporting that:
Prominent Nazi leaders have played upon the imaginations of their followers..with such phrases as &#x27;the night of the long knives&#x27; and &#x27;a vengeance for every Nazi killed&#x27;.

Also in 1932, the Nazi critic Carl von Ossietzky would use the term to describe the then unrealised plans for a violent uprising:
At the beginning of 1932 the Nazis seemed on the verge of a dictatorship, and the air was full of the stench of blood. By the end of it, Hitler&#x27;s party had been shaken by a major crisis, and the long knives were put quietly back in their box while all the Führer kept out was a wary ear.

Before its execution, the purge&#x27;s instigators referred to the plans under the codename &quot;Hummingbird&quot; (German: ), the word used to command execution squads into action on 30 June. However, soon after the purge Hitler himself named the events the &quot;Night of the long knives&quot; in his public speech on 13 July 1934 defending the actions (despite the violence taking place over several days).

==Legacy==
The Night of the Long Knives represented a triumph for Hitler, and a turning point for the German government. It established Hitler as &quot;the supreme leader of the German people&quot;, as he put it in his 13 July speech to the Reichstag. Hitler formally adopted this title in April 1942, thus placing himself above the reach of the law &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot;. Centuries of jurisprudence proscribing extrajudicial killings were swept aside. Despite some initial efforts by local prosecutors to take legal action against those who carried out the murders, which the regime rapidly quashed, it appeared that no law would constrain Hitler in his use of power.

Years later, in November 1945, while being interviewed by psychologist Gustave Gilbert in his cell during the Nuremberg trials, Göring angrily justified the killings to Gilbert, &quot;It&#x27;s a damn good thing I wiped them out, or they would have wiped us out!&quot;

<text>In folklore, giants (from Ancient Greek: &quot;&quot;, cognate ) are beings of humanoid appearance, but are at times prodigious in size and strength or bear an otherwise notable appearance. The word &quot;giant&quot; is first attested in 1297 from Robert of Gloucester&#x27;s chronicle. It is derived from the &quot;Gigantes&quot; () of Greek mythology. 

Fairy tales such as &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; have formed the modern perception of giants as dimwitted and violent ogres, sometimes said to eat humans, while other giants tend to eat livestock. In more recent portrayals, like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl, some giants are both intelligent and friendly.

==Literary and cultural analysis==
Giants appear many times in folklore and myths. Representing the human body enlarged to the point of being monstrous, giants evoke terror and remind humans of their body&#x27;s frailty and mortality. They are often portrayed as monsters and antagonists, but there are exceptions. Some giants intermingle with humans in a friendly way and can even be part of human families with their offspring being portrayed as regular humans where they are often referred to as half-giants.

Folklorists and historians examine the role giants are assigned in regional geomythologies. For example, Fionn mac Cumhaill is said to have built the Giant&#x27;s Causeway on the island of Ireland. Per a 1965 examination in an American studies journal, &quot;It is generally admitted today that Paul Bunyan was a synthetic figure conceived by advertising men rather than the spontaneous product of the folk mind, yet he has been adopted by the American people with enthusiasm...Paul and his blue ox Babe are supposed to have altered the appearance of the American continent; the animal&#x27;s hoof prints became the lake beds of the Northwest and from its drinking trough spilled the Mississippi River.&quot; Fossilized remains of ancient mammals and reptiles common to the Sivalik Hills of India may have influenced aspects of the Mahābhārata that tell of battles in which &quot;hundreds of mighty, and sometimes gigantic, heroes, horses, and war elephants are said to have died.&quot;

==Archeology and paleontology==

Claudine Cohen, in her 2002 book &quot;The Fate of the Mammoth&quot;, argued that the history of human interaction with fossil bones of prehistoric megafauna was heavily influenced by giant lore. Per Cohen, the proto-scientific study of giants appears in several phases of human history: Herodotus reported that the remains of Orestes were found in Tegea; Pliny described a giant&#x27;s skeleton found in Crete after an earthquake, and seemed to refer to evolution as the process by which giants become human-size over time; and Saint Augustine mentions what is believed to have been the fossilized molar of an ancient Elephantidae in his &quot;City of God&quot;, in a passage reflecting on the nature and meaning of the Noahacian deluge. The academic consideration of giants continued through the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and even the early modern period. Boccaccio devoted a passage of his &quot;Genealogies of the Pagan Gods&quot; to purported archeological discoveries in Sicily that he thought might be evidence of the historicity of &quot;The Odyssey&quot;&#x27;s Polyphemus. Rabelais created a wholly &quot;fabricated giantology&quot; for his 16th-century &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;. Massive bones found in 1613 in France were initially assigned to Teutobochus but the examinations of them by various physicians and their publication of diverging conclusions about the bones kicked off a &quot;pamphlet war&quot; between anatomists and surgeons of the day. The discovery of the so-called Claverack Giant in colonial New York triggered giantological investigations by two important early American intellectuals, Cotton Mather and Edward Taylor.

==Religion and mythology==
===Abrahamic===

Genesis tells of the Nephilim before and after Noah&#x27;s Flood. The word &quot;Nephilim&quot; is loosely translated as &quot;giants&quot; in some translations of the Hebrew Bible, but left untranslated in others. According to , the Nephilim were destroyed in the Flood, but Nephilim are reported after the Flood, including:

* The Anakim
* The Amorites
* The Rephaites, also known as The Emites

The Book of Numbers includes the discouraging report by the spies sent by Moses into Canaan: &quot;We can&#x27;t attack those people; they are stronger than we are. (...) All the people we saw there are of great size. We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.&quot; The Book of Joshua, describing the actual conquest of Canaan in a later generation, makes reference to such people living there in (Joshua 14:12–15 and Joshua 15:13–14).
The Bible also tells of Gog and Magog, who later entered European folklore, and of the famous battle between David and the Philistine Goliath. While Goliath is often portrayed as a giant in retellings of the Biblical narrative, he appears to be significantly smaller than other giants, biblical or otherwise. The Masoretic Text version of the Book of Samuel gives his height as six cubits and one span (possibly ), while the Septuagint, the 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus and the 2nd–1st-centuries BCE Dead Sea Scrolls give Goliath&#x27;s height as four cubits and one span (possibly ). For comparison, the Anakites are described as making the Israelites seem like grasshoppers. See also Gibborim.

Josephus also described the Amorites as giants in his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, circa 93CE, indicating that some sort of fossils may have been on display at that time: &quot;For which reason they removed their camp to Hebron; and when they had taken it, they slew all the inhabitants. There were till then left the race of giants, who had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to the sight, and terrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to this very day, unlike to any credible relations of other men.&quot;

The Book of Enoch describes giants as the offspring of Watchers and women in 7:2.

===Armenian===
Hayk was known as the founder of the Armenian state. Hayk was part of a race of giants who helped construct the Tower of Babel. Ancient historian Movses Khorenatsi wrote, &quot;Hayk was handsome and personable, with curly hair, sparkling eyes and strong arms. Among the giants he was the bravest and most famous, opponent of all who raised their hand to become absolute ruler over the giants and heroes.&quot;

Mount Nemrut is known to have received its name from an Armenian tradition in which Nimrod was killed by an arrow shot by Hayk during a massive battle between two rival armies of giants to the south-east of Lake Van.

===Aztec===
Aztec mythology features the Quinametzin, a race of giant men created in one of the previous solar eras. They are credited with the construction of Teotihuacan.

===Basque===
Giants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living in the hills of the Basque Country. Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old lifestyle and customs in the forest. Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians, like in the legend of San Martin Txiki, while their most outstanding feature is their strength. It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations, hills and ages-old megalithic structures (dolmens, etc.), with similar explanations provided in different spots.

However, giants show different variants and forms, they are most frequently referred to as jentilak and mairuak, while as individuals they can be represented as Basajaun (&quot;the lord of the forests&quot;), Sanson (variation of the biblical Samson), Errolan (based on the Frankish army general Roland who fell dead at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass) or even Tartalo (a one-eyed giant akin to the Greek Cyclops Polyphemus).

===Bulgarian===

In Bulgarian mythology, giants called ispolini inhabited the Earth before modern humans. They lived in the mountains, fed on raw meat and often fought against dragons. Ispolini were afraid of blackberries which posed a danger of making the giants trip and die, so they offered sacrifices to that plant.

===Chilean===

There are tales of giants in the northern Chilean port town of Caldera telling of giants who play with ships moving them from one port to another. Tales of the same area also tells of giants who are able to crush humans with their feet and when laying down to sleep being so long as to reach from the mountains to the sea. In some stories the giants are black humanoids or black bulls. In southern Chile there are stories of giants said to belong to certain volcanoes such as Calbuco and Osorno.

The mythical city of Tololo Pampa in northern Chile is said to be guarded by a giant known by various names including; &quot;Pata Larga&quot;, &quot;Gigante Minero&quot; and &quot;Minero Gigante&quot;. The giant enters to the mountains to obtain riches to the princess of Tololo Pampa. If a person manages to watch the giant while he works folklore says the person will be blessed with good luck for the rest of their life.

===Greek===
In Greek mythology, the &quot;Gigantes&quot; (γίγαντες) were (according to the poet Hesiod) the children of Uranus (Ουρανός) and Gaia (Γαία) (spirits of the sky and the earth) where some depictions had them with snake-like legs. They were involved in a conflict with the Olympian gods called the &quot;Gigantomachy&quot; (Γιγαντομαχία) when Gaia had them attack Mount Olympus. This battle was eventually settled when the hero Heracles decided to help the Olympians. The Greeks believed some of them, like Enceladus, to lie buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

Herodotus in Book 1, Chapter 68, describes how the Spartans uncovered in Tegea the body of Orestes, which was seven cubits long ⁠ ⁠—  approximately 3.73m, or about 12feet 3inches. In his book &quot;The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus&quot;, Plutarch describes how the Athenians uncovered the body of Theseus, which was &quot;of more than ordinary size.&quot; The kneecaps of Ajax were exactly the size of a discus for the boy&#x27;s pentathlon, wrote Pausanias. A boy&#x27;s discus was about in diameter, while a normal adult patella is around , suggesting Ajax may have been nearly 14feet (over 4m) tall.

The Cyclopes are also compared to giants due to their huge size (e.g.Polyphemus, son of Poseidon and Thoosa and nemesis of Odysseus in Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;). The Elder Cyclopes were the children of Gaia and Uranus, and later made Zeus&#x27; &quot;master thunderbolt&quot;, Poseidon&#x27;s trident, and Hades&#x27; &quot;helm of darkness&quot;, during the Titanomachy.

The Hecatoncheires are giants that have 100 arms and 50 heads who were also the children of Gaia and Uranus.

Other known giant races in Greek mythology include the six-armed Gegeines, the northern Hyperboreans, and the cannibalistic Laestrygonians.

===Hindu===
There are accounts stating humans grew to the size of giants during the Satya Yuga, the first of the four cyclical ages (yugas) in the Hindu reckoning of time.

===Jain===
According to Jainism, there was a time when giants walked upon this earth. Jain cosmology divides the worldly cycle of time into two parts or half-cycles, &quot;avasarpani&quot; (age of descending purity) and ascending (&quot;utsarpani&quot;).
According to Jain texts, the height of Rishabhanatha, first &quot;tirthankara&quot; of the present half-cycle of time (&quot;avasarpani&quot;) was 500 &quot;dhanusa&quot; (longbow).
In &quot;avasarpani&quot;, as the cycle moves ahead, height of all humans and animals decreases. The following table depicts the six &quot;aras&quot; of &quot;avasarpini&quot;–
===Norse===

In Norse mythology, the (cognate with and ) are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as &quot;giants&quot;, most are described as being roughly human-sized. Some are portrayed as huge, such as some frost giants (&quot;hrímþursar&quot;), fire giants (&quot;eldjötnar&quot;), and mountain giants (&quot;bergrisar&quot;). The are the origin of most of various monsters in Norse mythology (e.g. the Fenrisulfr) and in the eventual battle of Ragnarök, the giants will storm Asgard and fight the gods until the world is destroyed. Even so, the gods themselves were related to the by many marriages and descent; there are also such as Ægir who have good relationships with the gods and bear little difference in status to them. Odin, often regarded as the chief god, is the great-grandson of the Ymir. Norse mythology also holds that the entire world of men was created from the flesh of Ymir, a giant of cosmic proportions whose name is considered by some scholars to share a root with Yama of Indo-Iranian mythology.

Trolls are beings that are sometimes very large. The name &quot;troll&quot; is applied to .

An old Icelandic legend says that two night-prowling giants, a man and a woman, were traversing the fjord near Drangey Island with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight, all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant, the name means &quot;old hag&quot;) is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island, but he disappeared long ago.

A &quot;bergrisi&quot; – the traditional protector of southwestern Iceland – appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Iceland.

===Paiute===
According to Northern Paiute oral history, the Si-Te-Cah or Sai&#x27;i are a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants, the remains of which were allegedly found in 1911 by guano miners in Nevada&#x27;s Lovelock Cave. Furthermore, the Paiute creation story tells of &quot;beautiful giants&quot; who once lived between the Sierra Nevadas and the Rocky Mountains. After giving birth to a disfigured child, the giants treated the child so poorly that the Great Spirit responded by making the land hot and desolate and allowing enemies to conquer the giants. Only two giants survived: Paiute and his wife, both of whose skin became brown from eternally living in the hot desert.

===Roman===
Several Jupiter-Giant-Columns have been found in Germania Superior. These were crowned with a statue of Jupiter, typically on horseback, defeating or trampling down a giant, often depicted as a snake. They are restricted to the area of south-western Germany, western Switzerland, French Jura, and Alsace.

===Other European===

In folklore from all over Europe, giants were believed to have built the remains of previous civilizations. The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus thought giants had a hand in the creation of megalithic monuments. Similarly, the Old English poem &quot;The Seafarer&quot; speaks of the high stone walls that were the work of giants. Natural geologic features such as the massive basalt columns of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway on the coast of Northern Ireland were attributed to construction by giants.

In the Netherlands, giants are often associated with creating or forming the landscape. For instance, two giants are said to have dug a channel, until they reached the village of Akkrum, where they had an argument and each went his own way, thus splitting the channel into two separate waterways. Others threw up hills, or became hills themselves when they died on the spot. In several legends, giants were evil beings that threatened, robbed and killed travellers or locals; such as Ellert and Brammert, in the province of Drenthe.

Medieval chivalry romances such as the Spanish &quot;Amadís de Gaula&quot; feature giants as antagonists, or, rarely, as allies. This is parodied famously in Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, when the title character attacks a windmill, believing it to be a giant. This is the source of the phrase tilting at windmills.

Tales of combat with giants were a common feature in the folklore of the British Isles. Celtic giants also figure in Breton and Arthurian romances. In Kinloch Rannoch, a local myth has a local hill resembling a giant named as &quot;The Sleeping Giant&quot;. Folklore says the giant will awaken only if a specific musical instrument is played near the hill. Giants are also prominent in Welsh folklore.

Many giants in English folklore were noted for their stupidity. A giant who had quarrelled with the Mayor of Shrewsbury went to bury the city with dirt; however, he met a shoemaker, carrying shoes to repair, and the shoemaker convinced the giant that he had worn out all the shoes coming from Shrewsbury, and so it was too far to travel. Other English stories told of how giants threw stones at each other, which was used to explain many great stones on the landscape.

Giants figure in folklore and fairy tales, such as &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;, &quot;The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body&quot;, &quot;Nix Nought Nothing&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon&quot;, &quot;Young Ronald&quot;, and Paul Bunyan. Ogres are humanoid creatures, sometimes of gigantic stature, that occur in various sorts of European folklore.

Rübezahl, is a kind giant from German folklore who lived in the Giant Mountains, along with the Bergmönch, a giant mountain spirit.

Antero Vipunen is a giant shaman that appears in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, meeting the epic hero Väinämöinen to teach him creation spells.

<text>Forestry is the science and craft of creating, managing, planting, using, conserving and repairing forests and woodlands for associated resources for human and environmental benefits. Forestry is practiced in plantations and natural stands. The science of forestry has elements that belong to the biological, physical, social, political and managerial sciences. Forest management plays an essential role in the creation and modification of habitats and affects ecosystem services provisioning.

Modern forestry generally embraces a broad range of concerns, in what is known as multiple-use management, including: the provision of timber, fuel wood, wildlife habitat, natural water quality management, recreation, landscape and community protection, employment, aesthetically appealing landscapes, biodiversity management, watershed management, erosion control, and preserving forests as &quot;sinks&quot; for atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Forest ecosystems have come to be seen as the most important component of the biosphere, and forestry has emerged as a vital applied science, craft, and technology. A practitioner of forestry is known as a forester. Another common term is silviculturist. Silviculture is narrower than forestry, being concerned only with forest plants, but is often used synonymously with forestry.

All people depend upon forests and their biodiversity, some more than others. Forestry is an important economic segment in various industrial countries, as forests provide more than 86 million green jobs and support the livelihoods of many more people. For example, in Germany, forests cover nearly a third of the land area, wood is the most important renewable resource, and forestry supports more than a million jobs and about €181 billion of value to the German economy each year.

Worldwide, an estimated 880 million people spend part of their time collecting fuelwood or producing charcoal, many of them women. Human populations tend to be low in areas of low-income countries with high forest cover and high forest biodiversity, but poverty rates in these areas tend to be high. Some 252 million people living in forests and savannahs have incomes of less than US$1.25 per day.

== Science ==

=== Forestry as a science ===
Over the past centuries, forestry was regarded as a separate science. With the rise of ecology and environmental science, there has been a reordering in the applied sciences. In line with this view, forestry is a primary land-use science comparable with agriculture. Under these headings, the fundamentals behind the management of natural forests comes by way of natural ecology. Forests or tree plantations, those whose primary purpose is the extraction of forest products, are planned and managed to utilize a mix of ecological and agroecological principles. In many regions of the world there is considerable conflict between forest practices and other societal priorities such as water quality, watershed preservation, sustainable fishing, conservation, and species preservation.

=== Silvology ===

Silvology (Latin: &quot;silva&quot; or &quot;sylva&quot;, &quot;forests and woods&quot;; , &quot;-logia&quot;, &quot;science of&quot; or &quot;study of&quot;) is the biological science of studying forests and woodlands, incorporating the understanding of natural forest ecosystems, and the effects and development of silvicultural practices. The term complements silviculture, which deals with the art and practice of forest management.

Silvology is seen as a single science for forestry and was first used by Professor Roelof A.A. Oldeman at Wageningen University. It integrates the study of forests and forest ecology, dealing with single tree autecology and natural forest ecology.

=== Dendrology ===
=== Genetic diversity in forestry ===
The provenance of forest reproductive material used to plant forests has a great influence on how the trees develop, hence why it is important to use forest reproductive material of good quality and of high genetic diversity. More generally, all forest management practices, including in natural regeneration systems, may impact the genetic diversity of trees.

The term describes the differences in DNA sequence between individuals as distinct from variation caused by environmental influences. The unique genetic composition of an individual (its genotype) will determine its performance (its phenotype) at a particular site.

Genetic diversity is needed to maintain the vitality of forests and to provide resilience to pests and diseases. Genetic diversity also ensures that forest trees can survive, adapt and evolve under changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, genetic diversity is the foundation of biological diversity at species and ecosystem levels. Forest genetic resources are therefore important to consider in forest management.

Genetic diversity in forests is threatened by forest fires, pests and diseases, habitat fragmentation, poor silvicultural practices and inappropriate use of forest reproductive material.

About 98 million hectares of forest were affected by fire in 2015; this was mainly in the tropical domain, where fire burned about 4 percent of the total forest area in that year. More than two-thirds of the total forest area affected was in Africa and South America. Insects, diseases and severe weather events damaged about 40 million hectares of forests in 2015, mainly in the temperate and boreal domains.

Furthermore, the marginal populations of many tree species are facing new threats due to the effects of climate change.

Most countries in Europe have recommendations or guidelines for selecting species and provenances that can be used in a given site or zone.

===History of forestry education===

The first dedicated forestry school was established by Georg Ludwig Hartig at Hungen in the Wetterau, Hesse, in 1787, though forestry had been taught earlier in central Europe, including at the University of Giessen, in Hesse-Darmstadt.

In Spain, the first forestry school was the Forest Engineering School of Madrid (Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros de Montes), founded in 1844.

The first in North America, the Biltmore Forest School was established near Asheville, North Carolina, by Carl A. Schenck on September 1, 1898, on the grounds of George W. Vanderbilt&#x27;s Biltmore Estate. Another early school was the New York State College of Forestry, established at Cornell University just a few weeks later, in September 1898.

Early 19th century North American foresters went to Germany to study forestry. Some early German foresters also emigrated to North America.

In South America the first forestry school was established in Brazil, in Viçosa, Minas Gerais, in 1962, and moved the next year to become a faculty at the Federal University of Paraná, in Curitiba.

===Forestry education today===

Today, forestry education typically includes training in general biology, ecology, botany, genetics, soil science, climatology, hydrology, economics and forest management. Education in the basics of sociology and political science is often considered an advantage. Professional skills in conflict resolution and communication are also important in training programs.

In India, forestry education is imparted in the agricultural universities and in Forest Research Institutes (deemed universities). Four year degree programmes are conducted in these universities at the undergraduate level. Masters and Doctorate degrees are also available in these universities.

In the United States, postsecondary forestry education leading to a Bachelor&#x27;s degree or Master&#x27;s degree is accredited by the Society of American Foresters.

In Canada the Canadian Institute of Forestry awards silver rings to graduates from accredited university BSc programs, as well as college and technical programs.

In many European countries, training in forestry is made in accordance with requirements of the Bologna Process and the European Higher Education Area.

The International Union of Forest Research Organizations is the only international organization that coordinates forest science efforts worldwide.

===Continuing education===
In order to keep up with changing demands and environmental factors, forestry education does not stop at graduation. Increasingly, forestry professionals engage in regular training to maintain and improve on their management practices. An increasingly popular tool are marteloscopes; one hectare large, rectangular forest sites where all trees are numbered, mapped and recorded.

These sites can be used to do virtual thinnings and test one&#x27;s wood quality and volume estimations as well as tree microhabitats. This system is mainly suitable to regions with small-scale multi-functional forest management systems

== Society and culture ==

=== Literature ===
Forestry literature is the books, journals and other publications about forestry.

The first major works about forestry in the English language included Roger Taverner&#x27;s &quot;Booke of Survey&quot; (1565), John Manwood&#x27;s &quot;A Brefe Collection of the Lawes of the Forrest&quot; (1592) and John Evelyn&#x27;s &quot;Sylva&quot; (1662).

<text>Herbicides (, ), also commonly known as weed killers, are substances used to control undesired plants, also known as weeds. Selective herbicides control specific weed species while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed, while non-selective herbicides (sometimes called &quot;total weed killers&quot;) kill plants indiscriminately. The combined effects of herbicides, nitrogen fertilizer, and improved cultivars has increased yields (per acre) of major crops by three to six times from 1900 to 2000.

In the United States in 2012, about 91% of all herbicide usage, determined by weight applied, was in agriculture. In 2012, world pesticide expenditures totaled nearly $24.7 billion; herbicides were about 44% of those sales and constituted the biggest portion, followed by insecticides, fungicides, and fumigants. Herbicide is also used in forestry, where certain formulations have been found to suppress hardwood varieties in favor of conifers after clearcutting, as well as pasture systems.

==History==
Prior to the widespread use of herbicides, cultural controls, such as altering soil pH, salinity, or fertility levels, were used to control weeds. Mechanical control including tillage and flooding were also used to control weeds. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, inorganic chemicals such as sulfuric acid, arsenic, copper salts, kerosene and sodium chlorate were used to control weeds, but these chemicals were either toxic, flammable or corrosive and were expensive and ineffective at controlling weeds. 

===First herbicides===

The major breakthroughs occurred during the Second World War as the result of research conducted independently in the United Kingdom and the United States into the potential use of herbicides in war. The compound 2,4-D was first synthesized by W. G. Templeman at Imperial Chemical Industries. In 1940, his work with indoleacetic acid and naphthaleneacetic acid indicated that &quot;growth substances applied appropriately would kill certain broad-leaved weeds in cereals without harming the crops,&quot; though these substances were too expensive and too short-lived in soil due to degradation by microorganisms to be of practical agricultural use; by 1941, his team succeeded in synthesizing a wide range of chemicals to achieve the same effect at lower cost and better efficacy, including 2,4-D. In the same year, R. Pokorny in the US achieved this as well. Independently, a team under Juda Hirsch Quastel, working at the Rothamsted Experimental Station made the same discovery. Quastel was tasked by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) to discover methods for improving crop yield. By analyzing soil as a dynamic system, rather than an inert substance, he was able to apply techniques such as perfusion. Quastel was able to quantify the influence of various plant hormones, inhibitors, and other chemicals on the activity of microorganisms in the soil and assess their direct impact on plant growth. While the full work of the unit remained secret, certain discoveries were developed for commercial use after the war, including the 2,4-D compound.

When 2,4-D was commercially released in 1946, it became the first successful selective herbicide, triggering a worldwide revolution in agricultural output. It allowed for greatly enhanced weed control in wheat, maize (corn), rice, and similar cereal grass crops, because it kills dicots (broadleaf plants), but not most monocots (grasses). The low cost of 2,4-D has led to continued usage today, and it remains one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world. Like other acid herbicides, current formulations use either an amine salt (often trimethylamine) or one of many esters of the parent compound.

===Further discoveries===
The triazine family of herbicides, which includes atrazine, was introduced in the 1950s; they have the current distinction of being the herbicide family of greatest concern regarding groundwater contamination. Atrazine does not break down readily (within a few weeks) after being applied to soils of above-neutral pH. Under alkaline soil conditions, atrazine may be carried into the soil profile as far as the water table by soil water following rainfall causing the aforementioned contamination. Atrazine is thus said to have &quot;carryover&quot;, a generally undesirable property for herbicides.

Glyphosate had been first prepared in the 1950s but its herbicidal activity was only recognized in the 1960s. It was marketed as Roundup in 1971. The development of glyphosate-resistant crop plants, it is now used very extensively for selective weed control in growing crops. The pairing of the herbicide with the resistant seed contributed to the consolidation of the seed and chemistry industry in the late 1990s.

Many modern herbicides used in agriculture and gardening are specifically formulated to degrade within a short period after application.

==Terminology==
Herbicides can be classified/grouped in various ways; for example, according to their activity, the timing of application, method of application, mechanism of their action, and their chemical structures.

===Selectivity===
Chemical structure of the herbicide is of primary affecting efficacy. 2,4-D, mecoprop, and dicamba control many broadleaf weeds but remain ineffective against turf grasses.

Chemical additives influence selectivity. Surfactants alter the physical properties of the spray solution and the overall phytotoxicity of the herbicide, increasing translocation. Herbicide safeners enhance the selectivity by boosting herbicide resistance by the crop but allowing the herbicide to damage the weed.

Selectivity is determined by the circumstances and technique of application. Climatic factors affect absorption including humidity, light, precipitation, and temperature. Foliage-applied herbicides will enter the leaf more readily at high humidity by lengthening the drying time of the spray droplet and increasing cuticle hydration. Light of high intensity may break down some herbicides and cause the leaf cuticle to thicken, which can interfere with absorption. Precipitation may wash away or remove some foliage-applied herbicides, but it will increase root absorption of soil-applied herbicides. Drought-stressed plants are less likely to translocate herbicides. As temperature increases, herbicides&#x27; performance may decrease. Absorption and translocation may be reduced in very cold weather.

===Non-selective herbicides===
Non-selective herbicides, generally known as defoliants, are used to clear industrial sites, waste grounds, railways, and railway embankments. Paraquat, glufosinate, and glyphosate are non-selective herbicides.

===Timing of application===
* Preplant: Preplant herbicides are nonselective herbicides applied to the soil before planting. Some preplant herbicides may be mechanically incorporated into the soil. The objective for incorporation is to prevent dissipation through photodecomposition and/or volatility. The herbicides kill weeds as they grow through the herbicide-treated zone. Volatile herbicides have to be incorporated into the soil before planting the pasture. Crops grown in soil treated with a preplant herbicide include tomatoes, corn, soybeans, and strawberries. Soil fumigants like metam-sodium and dazomet are in use as preplant herbicides.
* Preemergence: Preemergence herbicides are applied before the weed seedlings emerge through the soil surface. Herbicides do not prevent weeds from germinating but they kill weeds as they grow through the herbicide-treated zone by affecting the cell division in the emerging seedling. Dithiopyr and pendimethalin are preemergence herbicides. Weeds that have already emerged before application or activation are not affected by pre-herbicides as their primary growing point escapes the treatment.
* Postemergence: These herbicides are applied after weed seedlings have emerged through the soil surface. They can be foliar or root absorbed, selective or nonselective, and contact or systemic. Application of these herbicides is avoided during rain since being washed off the soil makes it ineffective. 2,4-D is a selective, systemic, foliar-absorbed postemergence herbicide.

===Method of application===
* Soil applied: Herbicides applied to the soil are usually taken up by the root or shoot of the emerging seedlings and are used as preplant or preemergence treatment. Several factors influence the effectiveness of soil-applied herbicides. Weeds absorb herbicides by both passive and active mechanisms. Herbicide adsorption to soil colloids or organic matter often reduces the amount available for weed absorption. Positioning of the herbicide in the correct layer of soil is very important, which can be achieved mechanically and by rainfall. Herbicides on the soil surface are subjected to several processes that reduce their availability. Volatility and photolysis are two common processes that reduce the availability of herbicides. Many soil-applied herbicides are absorbed through plant shoots while they are still underground leading to their death or injury. EPTC and trifluralin are soil-applied herbicides.
* Foliar applied: These are applied to a portion of the plant above the ground and are absorbed by exposed tissues. These are generally postemergence herbicides and can either be translocated (systemic) throughout the plant or remain at a specific site (contact). External barriers of plants like cuticles, waxes, cell walls etc. affect herbicide absorption and action. Glyphosate, 2,4-D, and dicamba are foliar-applied herbicides.

===Persistence===
An herbicide is described as having low residual activity if it is neutralized within a short time of application (within a few weeks or months) – typically this is due to rainfall, or reactions in the soil. A herbicide described as having high residual activity will remain potent for the long term in the soil. For some compounds, the residual activity can leave the ground almost permanently barren.

==Mechanism of action==
Herbicides interfere with the biochemical machinery that supports plant growth. Herbicides often mimic natural plant hormones, enzyme substrates, and cofactors. They interfere with the metabolism in the target plants. Herbicides are often classified according to their site of action because as a general rule, herbicides within the same site of action class produce similar symptoms on susceptible plants. Classification based on the site of action of the herbicide is preferable as herbicide resistance management can be handled more effectively. Classification by mechanism of action (MOA) indicates the first enzyme, protein, or biochemical step affected in the plant following application:

* ACCase inhibitors: Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) is part of the first step of lipid synthesis. Thus, ACCase inhibitors affect cell membrane production in the meristems of the grass plant. The ACCases of grasses are sensitive to these herbicides, whereas the ACCases of dicot plants are not.
* ALS inhibitors: Acetolactate synthase (ALS; also known as acetohydroxyacid synthase, or AHAS) is part of the first step in the synthesis of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine). These herbicides slowly starve affected plants of these amino acids, which eventually leads to the inhibition of DNA synthesis. They affect grasses and dicots alike. The ALS inhibitor family includes various sulfonylureas (SUs) (such as flazasulfuron and metsulfuron-methyl), imidazolinones (IMIs), triazolopyrimidines (TPs), pyrimidinyl oxybenzoates (POBs), and sulfonylamino carbonyl triazolinones (SCTs). The ALS biological pathway exists only in plants and microorganisms (but not animals), thus making the ALS-inhibitors among the safest herbicides.
* EPSPS inhibitors: Enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase enzyme (EPSPS) is used in the synthesis of the amino acids tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine. They affect grasses and dicots alike. Glyphosate (Roundup) is a systemic EPSPS inhibitor inactivated by soil contact.
* Auxin-like herbicides: The discovery of synthetic auxins inaugurated the era of organic herbicides. They were discovered in the 1940s after a long study of the plant growth regulator auxin. Synthetic auxins mimic this plant hormone in some way. They have several points of action on the cell membrane, and are effective in the control of dicot plants. 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and Aminopyralid are examples of synthetic auxin herbicides.
* Photosystem II inhibitors reduce electron flow from water to NADP+ at the photochemical step in photosynthesis. They bind to the Qb site on the D1 protein, and prevent quinone from binding to this site. Therefore, this group of compounds causes electrons to accumulate on chlorophyll molecules. As a consequence, oxidation reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur, killing the plant. The triazine herbicides (including simazine, cyanazine, atrazine) and urea derivatives (diuron) are photosystem II inhibitors. Other members of this class are chlorbromuron, pyrazon, isoproturon, bromacil, and terbacil.
* Photosystem I inhibitors steal electrons from ferredoxins, specifically the normal pathway through FeS to Fdx to NADP+, leading to direct discharge of electrons on oxygen. As a result, reactive oxygen species are produced and oxidation reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur, leading to plant death. Bipyridinium herbicides (such as diquat and paraquat) inhibit the FeS to Fdx step of that chain, while diphenyl ether herbicides (such as nitrofen, nitrofluorfen, and acifluorfen) inhibit the Fdx to NADP+ step.
* HPPD inhibitors inhibit 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, which are involved in tyrosine breakdown. Tyrosine breakdown products are used by plants to make carotenoids, which protect chlorophyll in plants from being destroyed by sunlight. If this happens, the plants turn white due to complete loss of chlorophyll, and the plants die. Mesotrione and sulcotrione are herbicides in this class; a drug, nitisinone, was discovered in the course of developing this class of herbicides.

Complementary to mechanism-based classifications, herbicides are often classified according to their chemical structures or motifs. Similar structural types work in similar ways. For example, aryloxphenoxypropionates herbicides (diclofop chlorazifop, fluazifop) appear to all act as ACCase inhibitors. The so-called cyclohexanedione herbicides, which are used against grasses, include the following commercial products cycloxydim, clethodim, tralkoxydim, butroxydim, sethoxydim, profoxydim, and mesotrione. Knowing about herbicide chemical family grouping serves as a short-term strategy for managing resistance to site of action.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.4141/P05-193&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The phenoxyacetic acid mimic the natural auxin indoleacetic acid (IAA). This family includes MCPA, 2,4-D, and 2,4,5-T, picloram, dicamba, clopyralid, and triclopyr.

===WSSA and HRAC classification===
Using the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) and herbicide Resistance and World Grains (HRAC) systems, herbicides are classified by mode of action. Eventually the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee (HRAC) and the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) developed a classification system. Groups in the WSSA and the HRAC systems are designated by numbers and letters, inform users awareness of herbicide mode of action and provide more accurate recommendations for resistance management.

==Use and application==

Most herbicides are applied as water-based sprays using ground equipment. Ground equipment varies in design, but large areas can be sprayed using self-propelled sprayers equipped with long booms, of with spray nozzles spaced every apart. Towed, handheld, and even horse-drawn sprayers are also used. On large areas, herbicides may also at times be applied aerially using helicopters or airplanes, or through irrigation systems (known as chemigation).

Weed-wiping may also be used, where a wick wetted with herbicide is suspended from a boom and dragged or rolled across the tops of the taller weed plants. This allows treatment of taller grassland weeds by direct contact without affecting related but desirable shorter plants in the grassland sward beneath. The method has the benefit of avoiding spray drift. In Wales, a scheme offering free weed-wiper hire was launched in 2015 in an effort to reduce the levels of MCPA in water courses.

There is little difference in forestry in the early growth stages, when the height similarities between growing trees and growing annual crops yields a similar problem with weed competition. Unlike with annuals however, application is mostly unnecessary thereafter and is thus mostly used to decrease the delay between productive economic cycles of lumber crops.

===Misuse and misapplication===

Herbicide volatilisation or spray drift may result in herbicide affecting neighboring fields or plants, particularly in windy conditions. Sometimes, the wrong field or plants may be sprayed due to error.

=== Use politically, militarily, and in conflict ===

Although herbicidal warfare uses chemical substances, its main purpose is to disrupt agricultural food production or to destroy plants which provide cover or concealment to the enemy. During the Malayan Emergency, British Commonwealth forces deployed herbicides and defoliants in the Malaysian countryside in order to deprive Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) insurgents of cover, potential sources of food and to flush them out of the jungle. Deployment of herbicides and defoliants served the dual purpose of thinning jungle trails to prevent ambushes and destroying crop fields in regions where the MNLA was active to deprive them of potential sources of food. As part of this process, herbicides and defoliants were also sprayed from Royal Air Force aircraft. 

The use of herbicides as a chemical weapon by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War has left tangible, long-term impacts upon the Vietnamese people and U.S soldiers that handled the chemicals. More than 20% of South Vietnam&#x27;s forests and 3.2% of its cultivated land were sprayed at least once between during the war. The government of Vietnam says that up to four million people in Vietnam were exposed to the defoliant, and as many as three million people have suffered illness because of Agent Orange, while the Viet Nam Red Cross Society estimates that up to one million people were disabled or have health problems as a result of exposure to Agent Orange. The United States government has described these figures as unreliable.

==Health and environmental effects==

===Human health===
Many questions exist about herbicides&#x27; health and environmental effects, because of the many kinds of herbicide and the myriad potential targets, mostly unintended. For example, a 1995 panel of 13 scientists reviewing studies on the carcinogenicity of 2,4-D had divided opinions on the likelihood 2,4-D causes cancer in humans. , studies on phenoxy herbicides were too few to accurately assess the risk of many types of cancer from these herbicides, even although evidence was stronger that exposure to these herbicides is associated with increased risk of soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Toxicity

Herbicides have widely variable toxicity. Acute toxicity, short term exposure effects, and chronic toxicity, from long term environmental or occupational exposure. Much public suspicion of herbicides confuses valid statements of &quot;acute&quot; toxicity with equally valid statements of lack of &quot;chronic&quot; toxicity at the recommended levels of usage. For instance, while glyphosate formulations with tallowamine &quot;adjuvants&quot; are acutely toxic, their use was found to be uncorrelated with any health issues like cancer in a massive US Department of Health study on 90,000 members of farmer families for over a period of 23 years. That is, the study shows lack of chronic toxicity, but cannot question the herbicide&#x27;s acute toxicity.

Health effects

Some herbicides cause a range of health effects ranging from skin rashes to death. The pathway of attack can arise from intentional or unintentional direct consumption, improper application resulting in the herbicide coming into direct contact with people or wildlife, inhalation of aerial sprays, or food consumption prior to the labelled preharvest interval. Under some conditions, certain herbicides can be transported via leaching or surface runoff to contaminate groundwater or distant surface water sources. Generally, the conditions that promote herbicide transport include intense storm events (particularly shortly after application) and soils with limited capacity to adsorb or retain the herbicides. Herbicide properties that increase likelihood of transport include persistence (resistance to degradation) and high water solubility.

Contamination

Cases have been reported where Phenoxy herbicides are contaminated with dioxins such as TCDD; research has suggested such contamination results in a small rise in cancer risk after occupational exposure to these herbicides. Triazine exposure has been implicated in a likely relationship to increased risk of breast cancer, although a causal relationship remains unclear.

False claims

Herbicide manufacturers have at times made false or misleading claims about the safety of their products. Chemical manufacturer Monsanto Company agreed to change its advertising after pressure from New York attorney general Dennis Vacco; Vacco complained about misleading claims that its spray-on glyphosate-based herbicides, including Roundup, were safer than table salt and &quot;practically non-toxic&quot; to mammals, birds, and fish (though proof that this was ever said is hard to find). Roundup is toxic and has resulted in death after being ingested in quantities ranging from 85 to 200 ml, although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms. The manufacturer of Tordon 101 (Dow AgroSciences, owned by the Dow Chemical Company) has claimed Tordon 101 has no effects on animals and insects, in spite of evidence of strong carcinogenic activity of the active ingredient, picloram, in studies on rats.

===Ecological effects===
Herbicide use generally has negative impacts on many aspects of the environment. Insects, non-targeted plants, animals, and aquatic systems subject to serious damage from herbicides. Impacts are highly variable. 

====Aquatic life====
Atrazine has often been blamed for affecting reproductive behavior of aquatic life, but the data do not support this assertion.
====Bird populations====
Bird populations are one of many indicators of herbicide damage.Most observed effects are due not to toxicity, but to habitat changes and the decreases in abundance of species on which birds rely for food or shelter. Herbicide use in silviculture, used to favor certain types of growth following clearcutting, can cause significant drops in bird populations. Even when herbicides which have low toxicity to birds are used, they decrease the abundance of many types of vegetation on which the birds rely. Herbicide use in agriculture in the UK has been linked to a decline in seed-eating bird species which rely on the weeds killed by the herbicides. Heavy use of herbicides in neotropical agricultural areas has been one of many factors implicated in limiting the usefulness of such agricultural land for wintering migratory birds.

== Resistance ==
One major complication to the use of herbicides for weed control is the ability of plants to evolve herbicide resistance, rendering the herbicides ineffective against target plants. Out of 31 known herbicide modes of action, weeds have evolved resistance to 21. 268 plant species are known to have evolved herbicide resistance at least once. Herbicide resistance was first observed in 1957, and since has evolved repeatedly in weed species from 30 families across the globe. Weed resistance to herbicides has become a major concern in crop production worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1111/wre.12153&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Resistance to herbicides is often attributed to overuse as well as the strong evolutionary pressure on the affected weeds. Three agricultural practices account for the evolutionary pressure upon weeds to evolve resistance: monoculture, neglecting non-herbicide weed control practices, and reliance on one herbicide for weed control. To minimize resistance, rotational programs of herbicide application, where herbicides with multiple modes of action are used, have been widely promoted. In particular, glyphosate resistance evolved rapidly in part because when glyphosate use first began, it was continuously and heavily relied upon for weed control. This caused incredibly strong selective pressure upon weeds, encouraging mutations conferring glyphosate resistance to persist and spread.

However, in 2015, an expansive study showed an increase in herbicide resistance as a result of rotation, and instead recommended mixing multiple herbicides for simultaneous application. As of 2023, the effectiveness of combining herbicides is also questioned, particularly in light of the rise of non-target site resistance.

Plants developed resistance to atrazine and to ALS-inhibitors relatively early, but more recently, glyphosate resistance has dramatically risen. Marestail is one weed that has developed glyphosate resistance. Glyphosate-resistant weeds are present in the vast majority of soybean, cotton and corn farms in some U.S. states. Weeds that can resist multiple other herbicides are spreading. Few new herbicides are near commercialization, and none with a molecular mode of action for which there is no resistance. Because most herbicides could not kill all weeds, farmers rotate crops and herbicides to stop the development of resistant weeds.

A 2008–2009 survey of 144 populations of waterhemp in 41 Missouri counties revealed glyphosate resistance in 69%. Weeds from some 500 sites throughout Iowa in 2011 and 2012 revealed glyphosate resistance in approximately 64% of waterhemp samples. As of 2023, 58 weed species have developed glyphosate resistance. Weeds resistant to multiple herbicides with completely different biological action modes are on the rise. In Missouri, 43% of waterhemp samples were resistant to two different herbicides; 6% resisted three; and 0.5% resisted four. In Iowa 89% of waterhemp samples resist two or more herbicides, 25% resist three, and 10% resist five.

As of 2023, Palmer amaranth with resistance to six different herbicide modes of action has emerged. Annual bluegrass collected from a golf course in the U.S. state of Tennessee was found in 2020 to be resistant to seven herbicides at once. Rigid ryegrass and annual bluegrass share the distinction of the species with confirmed resistance to the largest number of herbicide modes of action, both with confirmed resistance to 12 different modes of action; however, this number references how many forms of herbicide resistance are known to have emerged in the species at some point, not how many have been found simultaneously in a single plant.

In 2015, Monsanto released crop seed varieties resistant to both dicamba and glyphosate, allowing for use of a greater variety of herbicides on fields without harming the crops. By 2020, five years after the release of dicamba-resistant seed, the first example of dicamba-resistant Palmer amaranth was found in one location.

===Evolutionary insights===
When mutations occur in the genes responsible for the biological mechanisms that herbicides interfere with, these mutations may cause the herbicide mode of action to work less effectively. This is called target-site resistance. Specific mutations that have the most helpful effect for the plant have been shown to occur in separate instances and dominate throughout resistant weed populations. This is an example of convergent evolution. Some mutations conferring herbicide resistance may have fitness costs, reducing the plant&#x27;s ability to survive in other ways, but over time, the least costly mutations tend to dominate in weed populations.

Recently, incidences of non-target site resistance have increasingly emerged, such as examples where plants are capable of producing enzymes that neutralize herbicides before they can enter the plant&#x27;s cells – metabolic resistance. This form of resistance is particularly challenging, since plants can develop non-target-site resistance to herbicides their ancestors were never directly exposed to.

===Biochemistry of resistance===
Resistance to herbicides can be based on one of the following biochemical mechanisms: 
* Target-site resistance: In target-site resistance, the genetic change that causes the resistance directly alters the chemical mechanism the herbicide targets. The mutation may relate to an enzyme with a crucial function in a metabolic pathway, or to a component of an electron-transport system. For example, ALS-resistant weeds developed by genetic mutations leading to an altered enzyme. Such changes render the herbicide impotent. Target-site resistance may also be caused by an over-expression of the target enzyme (via gene amplification or changes in a gene promoter). A related mechanism is that an adaptable enzyme such as cytochrome P450 is redesigned to neutralize the pesticide itself.
* Non-target-site resistance: In non-target-site resistance, the genetic change giving resistance is not directly related to the target site, but causes the plant to be less susceptible by some other means. Some mechanisms include metabolic detoxification of the herbicide in the weed, reduced uptake and translocation, sequestration of the herbicide, or reduced penetration of the herbicide into the leaf surface. These mechanisms all cause less of the herbicide&#x27;s active ingredient to reach the target site in the first place.
The following terms are also used to describe cases where plants are resistant to multiple herbicides at once: 
* Cross-resistance: In this case, a single resistance mechanism causes resistance to several herbicides. The term target-site cross-resistance is used when the herbicides bind to the same target site, whereas non-target-site cross-resistance is due to a single non-target-site mechanism (e.g., enhanced metabolic detoxification) that entails resistance across herbicides with different sites of action.
* Multiple resistance: In this situation, two or more resistance mechanisms are present within individual plants, or within a plant population.

===Resistance management===

Due to herbicide resistance – a major concern in agriculture – a number of products combine herbicides with different means of action. Integrated pest management may use herbicides alongside other pest control methods.

Integrated weed management (IWM) approach utilizes several tactics to combat weeds and forestall resistance. This approach relies less on herbicides and so selection pressure should be reduced. By relying on diverse weed control methods, including non-herbicide methods of weed control, the selection pressure on weeds to evolve resistance can be lowered. Researchers warn that if herbicide resistance is combatted only with more herbicides, &quot;evolution will most likely win.&quot; In 2017, the USEPA issued a revised Pesticide Registration Notice (PRN 2017-1), which provides guidance to pesticide registrants on required pesticide resistance management labeling. This requirement applies to all conventional pesticides and is meant to provide end-users with guidance on managing pesticide resistance. An example of a fully executed label compliant with the USEPA resistance management labeling guidance can be seen on the specimen label for the herbicide, cloransulam-methyl, updated in 2022.

Optimising herbicide input to the economic threshold level should avoid the unnecessary use of herbicides and reduce selection pressure. Herbicides should be used to their greatest potential by ensuring that the timing, dose, application method, soil and climatic conditions are optimal for good activity. In the UK, partially resistant grass weeds such as &quot;Alopecurus myosuroides&quot; (blackgrass) and Avena genus (wild oat) can often be controlled adequately when herbicides are applied at the 2-3 leaf stage, whereas later applications at the 2-3 tiller stage can fail badly. Patch spraying, or applying herbicide to only the badly infested areas of fields, is another means of reducing total herbicide use.

=== Approaches to treating resistant weeds ===

====Alternative herbicides====
When resistance is first suspected or confirmed, the efficacy of alternatives is likely to be the first consideration. If there is resistance to a single group of herbicides, then the use of herbicides from other groups may provide a simple and effective solution, at least in the short term. For example, many triazine-resistant weeds have been readily controlled by the use of alternative herbicides such as dicamba or glyphosate.

====Mixtures and sequences====
The use of two or more herbicides which have differing modes of action can reduce the selection for resistant genotypes. Ideally, each component in a mixture should:
* Be active at different target sites
* Have a high level of efficacy
* Be detoxified by different biochemical pathways
* Have similar persistence in the soil (if it is a residual herbicide)
* Exert negative cross-resistance
* Synergise the activity of the other component
No mixture is likely to have all these attributes, but the first two listed are the most important. There is a risk that mixtures will select for resistance to both components in the longer term. One practical advantage of sequences of two herbicides compared with mixtures is that a better appraisal of the efficacy of each herbicide component is possible, provided that sufficient time elapses between each application. A disadvantage with sequences is that two separate applications have to be made and it is possible that the later application will be less effective on weeds surviving the first application. If these are resistant, then the second herbicide in the sequence may increase selection for resistant individuals by killing the susceptible plants which were damaged but not killed by the first application, but allowing the larger, less affected, resistant plants to survive. This has been cited as one reason why ALS-resistant &quot;Stellaria media&quot; has evolved in Scotland recently (2000), despite the regular use of a sequence incorporating mecoprop, a herbicide with a different mode of action.

====Natural herbicide====
The term organic herbicide has come to mean herbicides intended for organic farming. Few natural herbicides rival the effectiveness of synthetics. Some plants also produce their own herbicides, such as the genus &quot;Juglans&quot; (walnuts), or the tree of heaven; such actions of natural herbicides, and other related chemical interactions, is called allelopathy. The applicability of these agents is unclear.

=== Farming practices and resistance: a case study ===
Herbicide resistance became a critical problem in Australian agriculture after many Australian sheep farmers began to exclusively grow wheat in their pastures in the 1970s. Introduced varieties of ryegrass, while good for grazing sheep, compete intensely with wheat. Ryegrasses produce so many seeds that, if left unchecked, they can completely choke a field. Herbicides provided excellent control, reducing soil disruption because of less need to plough. Within little more than a decade, ryegrass and other weeds began to develop resistance. In response Australian farmers changed methods. By 1983, patches of ryegrass had become immune to Hoegrass (diclofop-methyl), a family of herbicides that inhibit an enzyme called acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase.

Ryegrass populations were large and had substantial genetic diversity because farmers had planted many varieties. Ryegrass is cross-pollinated by wind, so genes shuffle frequently. To control its distribution, farmers sprayed inexpensive Hoegrass, creating selection pressure. In addition, farmers sometimes diluted the herbicide to save money, which allowed some plants to survive application. Farmers turned to a group of herbicides that block acetolactate synthase when resistance appeared. Once again, ryegrass in Australia evolved a kind of &quot;cross-resistance&quot; that allowed it to break down various herbicides rapidly. Four classes of herbicides become ineffective within a few years. In 2013, only two herbicide classes called Photosystem II and long-chain fatty acid inhibitors, were effective against ryegrass.

<text>The concept of an archetype ( ) appears in areas relating to behavior, historical psychology, philosophy and literary analysis.

An archetype can be any of the following:
# a statement, pattern of behavior, prototype, &quot;first&quot; form, or a main model that other statements, patterns of behavior, and objects copy, emulate, or &quot;merge&quot; into. Informal synonyms frequently used for this definition include &quot;standard example&quot;, &quot;basic example&quot;, and the longer-form &quot;archetypal example&quot;; mathematical archetypes often appear as &quot; examples&quot;.
# the Platonic concept of &quot;pure form&quot;, believed to embody the fundamental characteristics of a thing.
# the Jungian psychology concept of an inherited unconscious predisposition, behavioral trait or tendency (&quot;instinct&quot;) shared among the members of the species; as any behavioral trait the tendency comes to being by way of patterns of thought, images, affects or pulsions characterized by its qualitative likeness to distinct narrative constructs; unlike personality traits, many of the archetype&#x27;s fundamental characteristics are shared in common with the collective &amp; are not predominantly defined by the individual&#x27;s representation of them; and the tendency to utilize archetypal representations is postulated to arise from the evolutionary drive to establish specific cues corresponding with the historical evolutionary environment to better adapt to it. Such evolutionary drives are: survival and thriving in the physical environment, the relating function, acquiring knowledge, etc. It is communicated graphically as archetypal &quot;figures&quot;.
# a constantly-recurring symbol or motif in literature, painting, or mythology. This definition refers to the recurrence of characters or ideas sharing similar traits throughout various, seemingly unrelated cases in classic storytelling, media, etc. This usage of the term draws from both comparative anthropology and from Jungian archetypal theory.

Archetypes are also very close analogies to instincts, in that, long before any consciousness develops, it is the impersonal and inherited traits of human beings that present and motivate human behavior. They also continue to influence feelings and behavior even after some degree of consciousness developed later on.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;archetype&quot;, &quot;original pattern from which copies are made,&quot; first entered into English usage in the 1540s. It derives from the Latin noun , latinization of the Greek noun (), whose adjective form is (), which means &quot;first-molded&quot;, which is a compound of , &quot;beginning, origin&quot;, and , which can mean, among other things, &quot;pattern&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, or &quot;type&quot;. It, thus, referred to the beginning or origin of the pattern, model or type.

== Archetypes in literature ==

===Function===
Usage of archetypes in specific pieces of writing is a holistic approach, which can help the writing win universal acceptance. This is because readers can relate to and identify with the characters and the situation, both socially and culturally. By deploying common archetypes contextually, a writer aims to impart realism to their work. According to many literary critics, archetypes have a standard and recurring depiction in a particular human culture or the whole human race that ultimately lays concrete pillars and can shape the whole structure in a literary work.

=== Story archetypes ===
Christopher Booker, author of &quot;The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories&quot;, argues that the following basic archetypes underlie all stories:
# Overcoming the Monster
# Rags to Riches
# The Quest
# Voyage and Return
#Comedy
#Tragedy

These themes coincide with the characters of Jung&#x27;s archetypes.

===Literary criticism===
Archetypal literary criticism argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works and that a text&#x27;s meaning is shaped by cultural and psychological myths. Cultural archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or made concrete by recurring images, symbols, or patterns (which may include motifs such as the &quot;quest&quot; or the &quot;heavenly ascent&quot;; recognizable character types such as the &quot;trickster&quot;, &quot;saint&quot;, &quot;martyr&quot; or the &quot;hero&quot;; symbols such as the apple or the snake; and imagery) and that have all been laden with meaning prior to their inclusion in any particular work.

The archetypes reveal shared roles universal among societies, such as the role of the mother in her natural relations with all members of the family. These archetypes create a shared imagery which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious, and mythical framework.

==Platonic archetypes==

The origins of the archetypal hypothesis date as far back as Plato. Plato&#x27;s &quot;eidos&quot;, or &quot;ideas&quot;, were pure mental forms that were said to be imprinted in the soul before it was born into the world. Some philosophers also translate the archetype as &quot;essence&quot; in order to avoid confusion with respect to Plato&#x27;s conceptualization of Forms. While it is tempting to think of Forms as mental entities (ideas) that exist only in our mind, the philosopher insisted that they are independent of any minds (real). Eidos were collective in the sense that they embodied the fundamental characteristics of a thing rather than its specific peculiarities. In the seventeenth century, Sir Thomas Browne and Francis Bacon both employ the word &quot;archetype&quot; in their writings; Browne in &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot; (1658) attempted to depict archetypes in his usage of symbolic proper-names.

==Jungian archetypes==

The concept of psychological archetypes was advanced by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, c. 1919. Jung has acknowledged that his conceptualization of archetype is influenced by Plato&#x27;s &quot;eidos&quot;, which he described as &quot;the formulated meaning of a primordial image by which it was represented symbolically.&quot; According to Jung, the term &quot;archetype&quot; is an explanatory paraphrase of the Platonic &quot;eidos&quot;, also believed to represent the word &quot;form&quot;. He maintained that Platonic archetypes are metaphysical ideas, paradigms, or models, and that real things are held to be only copies of these model ideas. However, archetypes are not easily recognizable in Plato&#x27;s works in the way in which Jung meant them.

In Jung&#x27;s psychological framework, archetypes are innate, libidinally collective schemas, universal prototypes for idea-sensory impression images and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and interpretations associated with an archetype is a complex (e.g. a mother complex associated with the mother archetype). Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological constructs that arose through evolution. At the same time, it has also been observed that evolution can itself be considered an archetypal construct.
Jung states in part one of &quot;Man And His Symbols&quot; that:While there are a variety of categorizations of archetypes, Jung&#x27;s configuration is perhaps the most well known and serves as the foundation for many other models. The four major archetypes to emerge from his work, which Jung originally terms &quot;primordial images,&quot; include the anima/animus, the self, the shadow, and the persona. Additionally, Jung referred to images of the wise old man, the child, the mother, and the maiden. He believed that each human mind retains these basic unconscious understandings of the human condition and the collective knowledge of our species in the construct of the collective unconscious.

=== Neo-Jungian concepts ===
Other authors, such as Carol Pearson and Margaret Mark, have attributed 12 different archetypes to Jung, organized in three overarching categories, based on a fundamental driving force. These include:

Other authors, such as Margaret Hartwell and Joshua Chen, go further to give these 12 archetypes families 5 archetypes each.
They are as follows:
== Other uses of archetypes ==
There is also the position that the use of archetypes in different ways is possible because every archetype has multiple manifestations, with each one featuring different attributes. For instance, there is the position that the function of the archetype must be approached according to the context of biological sciences and is accomplished through the concept of the ultimate function. This pertains to the organism&#x27;s response to those pressures in terms of biological trait.

=== Dichter&#x27;s application of archetypes ===
Later in the 1900s, a Viennese psychologist named Dr. Ernest Dichter took these psychological constructs and applied them to marketing. Dichter moved to New York around 1939 and sent every ad agency on Madison Avenue a letter boasting of his new discovery. He found that applying these universal themes to products promoted easier discovery and stronger loyalty for brands.

<text>The Musée d&#x27;Orsay ( , , ) () is a museum in Paris, France, on the Left Bank of the Seine. It is housed in the former Gare d&#x27;Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built between 1898 and 1900. The museum holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914, including paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography. It houses the largest collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world, by painters including Berthe Morisot, Claude Monet, Édouard Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and van Gogh. Many of these works were held at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume prior to the museum&#x27;s opening in 1986. It is one of the largest art museums in Europe.

In 2022 the museum had 3.2 million visitors, up from 1.4 million in 2021. It was the sixth-most-visited art museum in the world in 2022, and second-most-visited art museum in France, after the Louvre.

==History==

The museum building was originally a railway station, Gare d&#x27;OrsayGary Oldman, located next to the Seine river. Built on the site of the Palais d&#x27;Orsay, its central location was convenient for commuting travelers. The station was constructed for the Chemin de Fer de Paris à Orléans and finished in time for the 1900 Exposition Universelle to the design of three architects: Lucien Magne, Émile Bénard and Victor Laloux. The Gare d&#x27;Orsay design was considered to be an &quot;anachronism&quot;. Since trains were such a modern innovation for the time architects and designers alike expected a building that would embody the modern traits of this new mode of transportation. Gare d&#x27;Orsay instead gained inspiration from the past for the concept of the facade to the point of masking the cutting-edge technology within. It was the terminus for the railways of southwestern France until 1939.

By 1939 the station&#x27;s short platforms had become unsuitable for the longer trains that had come to be used for mainline services. After 1939 it was used for suburban services and part of it became a mailing centre during World War II. It was then used as a set for several films, such as Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot; adapted by Orson Welles, and as a haven for the Renaud–Barrault Theatre Company and for auctioneers, while the Hôtel Drouot was being rebuilt.

In the 1970s work began on building a 1 km-long tunnel under the station as part of the creation of line C of the Réseau Express Régional with a new station under the old station. In 1970, permission was granted to demolish the station but Jacques Duhamel, Minister for Cultural Affairs, ruled against plans to build a new hotel in its stead. The station was put on the supplementary list of Historic Monuments and finally listed in 1978. The suggestion to turn the station into a museum came from the Directorate of the Museum of France. The idea was to build a museum that would bridge the gap between the Louvre and the National Museum of Modern Art at the Georges Pompidou Centre. The plan was accepted by Georges Pompidou and a study was commissioned in 1974. In 1978, a competition was organized to design the new museum. ACT Architecture, a team of three young architects (Pierre Colboc, Renaud Bardon and Jean-Paul Philippon), were awarded the contract which involved creating of new floorspace on four floors. The construction work was carried out by Bouygues. In 1981, the Italian architect Gae Aulenti was chosen to design the interior including the internal arrangement, decoration, furniture and fittings of the museum. The arrangement of the galleries she designed was elaborate and inhabited the three main levels that are under the museum&#x27;s barrel vault atrium. On the main level of the building, a central nave was formed by the surrounding stone structures that were previously the building&#x27;s train platforms. The central nave&#x27;s structures break up the immense sculpture and gallery spaces and provided more organized units for viewing the art. In July 1986, the museum was ready to receive its exhibits. It took 6 months to install the 2,000 or so paintings, 600 sculptures and other works. The museum officially opened in December 1986 by then-president François Mitterrand.

At any time about 3,000 art pieces are on display within Musée d&#x27;Orsay. Within the museum is a 1:100 scale model created by Richard Peduzzi of an aerial view of Paris Opera and surrounding area. This model is encapsulated underneath glass flooring that viewers walk on as they proceed through the museum. This installation allows the viewers to understand the city planning of Paris at the time, which has made this attraction one of the most popular within the museum.

Another exhibit within the museum is &quot;A Passion for France: The Marlene and Spencer Hays Collection&quot;. This collection was donated by an Marlene and Spencer Hays, art collectors who reside in Texas and have been collecting art since the early 1970s. In 2016 the museum complied to keeping the collection of about 600 art pieces in one collection rather than dispersed throughout other exhibits. Since World War II, France has not been donated a collection of foreign art this large. The collection favors mostly post-impressionist works. Artists featured in this collection are Bonnard, Vuillard, Maurice Denis, Odilon Redon, Aristide Maillol, André Derain, Edgar Degas, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. To make room for the art that has been donated, the Musée d&#x27;Orsay is scheduled to undergo a radical transformation over the next decade, 2020 on. This remodel is funded in part by an anonymous US patron who donated €20 million to a building project known as &quot;Orsay Grand Ouvert&quot; (Orsay Wide Open). The gift was made via the American Friends of the Musées d&#x27;Orsay et de l&#x27;Orangerie. The projected completion date is 2026, implementing new galleries and education opportunities to endorse a conductive experience.


The square next to the museum displays six bronze allegorical sculptural groups in a row, originally produced for the :

===Sculptures===
Sculpture was in high demand in the 19th century and became widely used as a way to display a person&#x27;s social and political standings. The style and ideology represented by many of the sculptures were out of fashion by the mid-20th century, and the sculptures were put into storage and no longer displayed. It wasn&#x27;t until the conversion of the Orsay railway station into the Musée d&#x27;Orsay museum in the 1970s that many sculptures from the 19th century were placed on exhibit again. The substantial nave inside the new museum offered a perfect area for the display of sculptures. During the grand opening in December 1986 of the museum, 1,200 sculptures were present, brought in from collections such as the Louvre, state loans, and Musée du Luxembourg. The museum also obtained more than 200 sculptures before opening though donations of art connoisseurs, the lineage of artists, and people
in support of the Musée d&#x27;Orsay.

Since the grand opening in 1986 the museum has collected works from exchanges that other museums or institutions once showcased such as &quot;Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science&quot; by Louis-Ernest Barrias that was initially commissioned for Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, as well as &quot;The Thinker&quot; and &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot; by Auguste Rodin. The museum also purchases specific works to fill gaps and finish the collections already in the museum such as one of the panels of &quot;Be Mysterious&quot; by Paul Gauguin, the full set of Honoré Daumier&#x27;s &quot;Célébrités du Juste Milieu&quot;, and &quot;Maturity&quot; by Camille Claudel. There are currently more than 2,200 sculptures in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay.

Major sculptors represented in the collection include Alfred Barye, François Rude, Jules Cavelier, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Émile-Coriolan Guillemin, Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, Camille Claudel, Sarah Bernhardt, Aristide Maillol and Honoré Daumier.

<doc id="53922" wikidata="Q186954" url="?curid=53922" title="Beaulieu, Hampshire">
<text>Beaulieu ( ) is a village located on the southeastern edge of the New Forest in Hampshire, England. It is home to both Palace House and the National Motor Museum. In 2020, it was named the fifth most beautiful village in the UK and Ireland by &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;.

== History ==

The name &quot;Beaulieu&quot; comes from the French &quot;beau lieu&quot;, which means &quot;beautiful place&quot;. It is derived from Beaulieu Abbey, which was populated by 30 monks sent from the French abbey of Cîteaux, the mother house of the Cistercian order. The medieval Latin name of the monastery was &quot;Bellus Locus Regis&quot; (&quot;the beautiful place of the king&quot;) or &quot;monasterium Belli loci Regis&quot;.

During the Second World War, the Beaulieu Estate of Lord Montagu in the New Forest was the site of group B schools for agents operated by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) between 1941 and 1945. One of the trainers was Kim Philby, who was later found to be spying for the Soviets. In 2005, a special exhibition was installed at the Beaulieu Estate, with a video showing photographs from that era as well as voice recordings of former SOE trainers and agents.

The village has remained largely unspoilt by industrial progress and is a favourite stop for tourists in the area, as well as birdwatchers seeking local species like the Dartford warbler, European honey buzzard, and Eurasian hobby.

== Transport ==
The nearest railway station is Beaulieu Road, about away on the London-Weymouth main line. While the station previously had infrequent service, 20 trains a day now stop there. Wilts &amp; Dorset bus service 112 serves the village on its way between Hythe and Lymington. In the summer, Beaulieu is served by the New Forest Tour, an hourly open-top bus service.

== Palace House ==

Palace House, not to be confused with the Palace of Beaulieu in Essex, overlooks the village from across the Beaulieu River and began in 1204 as the gatehouse to Beaulieu Abbey. It has been the ancestral home of a branch of the Montagu family since 1538, when it was seized from the monks and sold during Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries.

The house was extended in the 16th century, and again in the 19th century; today, it is a fine example of a Gothic country house. Although still home to the current Lord and Lady Montagu, parts of the house and gardens are open to the public every day. It is a member of the Treasure Houses of England consortium.

==Culture==
The village is home to the National Motor Museum, opened in 1952 as the Montagu Motor Museum before becoming a charitable trust in 1972. It contains an important collection of historic motor vehicles, including four world land speed record holders: Sir Malcolm Campbell&#x27;s 1920 Sunbeam 350hp, his son Donald Campbell&#x27;s 1961 Bluebird-Proteus CN7, the 1927 Sunbeam 1000hp (the first motor car to reach ), and the 1929 Irving-Napier Special &#x27;Golden Arrow&#x27;. The latter two were both driven by Major Henry Segrave.

In the late 1950s, Beaulieu was the surprising location for one of Britain&#x27;s first experiments in pop festival culture, with the annual Beaulieu Jazz Festival, which quickly expanded to become a significant event in the burgeoning jazz and youth pop music scene of the period. Camping overnight, a rural invasion, eccentric dress, wild music and sometimes wilder behaviour; these now familiar features of pop festivals happened at Beaulieu each summer, culminating in the so-called &#x27;Battle of Beaulieu&#x27; at the 1960 festival, when rival gangs of modern and traditional jazz fans indulged in a spot of what sociologists went on to call &#x27;subcultural contestation&#x27;.

==In popular culture==
Palace House was featured in the comedy-drama film &quot;Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont&quot; (2005).

<doc id="53925" wikidata="Q2646905" url="?curid=53925" title="Arms and the Man">
<text>Arms and the Man is a comedy by George Bernard Shaw, whose title comes from the opening words of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, in Latin:
&quot;Arma virumque cano&quot; (&quot;Of arms and the man I sing&quot;).

The play was first produced on 21 April 1894 at the Avenue Theatre and published in 1898 as part of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Plays Pleasant&quot; volume, which also included &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;You Never Can Tell,&quot; and &quot;The Man of Destiny.&quot; &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; was one of Shaw&#x27;s first commercial successes. He was called on to stage after the curtain, where he received enthusiastic applause. Amidst the cheers, one audience member booed. Shaw riposted, &quot;My dear fellow, I quite agree with you, but what are we two against so many?&quot;

&quot;Arms and the Man&quot; humorously exposes the futility of war and the hypocrisies of human nature.

==Plot summary==
The play takes place during the 1885 Serbo-Bulgarian War. Its heroine, Raina Petkoff, is a young Bulgarian woman engaged to Sergius Saranoff, a battlefield hero whom she idolizes. On the night after the Battle of Slivnitza, Captain Bluntschli, a Swiss mercenary in the defeated Serbian army, climbs in through her bedroom balcony and threatens her not to give the alarm. When Russian and Bulgarian troops burst in to search for him, Raina hides him. He tells her that &quot;nine soldiers out of ten are born fools&quot;. Bluntschli&#x27;s businesslike attitude to war shocks the idealistic Raina, especially after he admits that he uses his ammunition pouches to carry chocolates rather than pistol cartridges. When the search dies down, Raina and her mother Catherine sneak him out of the house, disguised in one of Raina&#x27;s father&#x27;s old coats.

The war ends and Raina&#x27;s father, Major Paul Petkoff, returns home with Sergius. Raina begins to find Sergius bombastic and tiresome, but she hides it. Sergius also finds Raina&#x27;s romantic ideals tiresome, and flirts with Raina&#x27;s insolent servant girl Louka (a soubrette role), who is engaged to the Petkoffs&#x27; manservant Nicola. Bluntschli unexpectedly returns to give back the old coat, but also to see Raina. Raina and her mother are shocked when Major Petkoff and Sergius reveal that they have met Bluntschli before and invite him to lunch (and to help them figure out how to send the troops home).

Left alone with Bluntschli, Raina realizes that though he sees through her romanticism, he respects her, as Sergius does not. She reveals that she left a photograph of herself in a pocket of the coat, inscribed &quot;To my chocolate-cream soldier&quot;, but Bluntschli says he did not find it, and it must still be in the coat. Bluntschli gets a telegram informing him of his father&#x27;s death: he must now take over the family&#x27;s luxury hotels in Switzerland.

Louka gossips to Sergius that Raina had protected Bluntschli and is in love with him. Sergius challenges Bluntschli to a duel, but Bluntschli evades it. Sergius and Raina break off their engagement, with some relief on both sides. Major Petkoff discovers the photograph in the pocket of his old coat; Raina and Bluntschli try to dispose of it, but Petkoff is determined to learn the truth and claims that the &quot;chocolate-cream soldier&quot; is Sergius. After Bluntschli confesses the whole story to Major Petkoff, Sergius proposes marriage to Louka (to Major Petkoff and Catherine&#x27;s horror); the manservant Nicola quietly and gallantly lets Sergius have her; and Bluntschli, recognising Nicola&#x27;s merits, offers him a job as hotel manager.

While Raina is now unattached, Bluntschli protests that—being 34 and believing she is 17—he is too old for her. On learning that she is actually 23, he immediately proposes and shows her the telegram announcing his inheritance. Raina, realizing the hollowness of her romantic ideals, protests that she would prefer him as a poor &quot;chocolate-cream soldier&quot; than as a wealthy businessman. Bluntschli protests that he is still the same person, and she proclaims her love for him. The play ends as Bluntschli, with Swiss precision, arranges the major&#x27;s troop movements and informs them he will return to marry Raina in exactly two weeks.

==Reception==
George Orwell said that &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; was written when Shaw was at the height of his powers as a dramatist. &quot;It is probably the wittiest play he ever wrote, the most flawless technically, and in spite of being a very light comedy, the most telling.&quot; His other plays of the period, equally well written, were about issues that, according to Orwell, were no longer controversial at the time Orwell was writing. For example, the theme of &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot;, which so shocked audiences at the time, was that the causes of prostitution are mainly economic, which was already a common opinion in Orwell&#x27;s time, and the play &quot;Widowers&#x27; Houses&quot; was an attack on slum landlords, who had since become stock villains.

In 2024, an attempt to stage John Malkovich&#x27;s production of the play at Ivan Vazov National Theatre of Bulgaria was targeted by nationalist protesters that considered it a calumny of Bulgaria. The mob surrounded the theatre, threw smoke bombs, prevented the visitors that had bought tickets from entering the theatre hall, accusing them of being traitors and threatening them, and physically assaulted the director of the play and the director of the theatre.

==Subsequent productions==

* The first Broadway production opened on 17 September 1894 at New York City&#x27;s Herald Square Theatre. Since then there have been six Broadway revivals, two of which are listed below.
* The most prestigious London revival was directed by John Burrell for The Old Vic Company at the New Theatre, which opened on 5 September 1944, starring Ralph Richardson (Bluntschli), Margaret Leighton (Raina Petkoff), Joyce Redman (Louka), and Laurence Olivier (Major Sergius Saranoff). &quot;Olivier thought Sergius a humbug, a buffoon, a blackguard, a coward, &#x27;a bloody awful part&#x27; until Tyrone Guthrie said he would never succeed in the role until he learned to love Sergius. Olivier, spurred and moustachioed, was high camp&quot;: Robert Tanitch.
* A revival production ran at New York City&#x27;s Arena Theatre from 19 October 1950 to 21 January 1951, for a total of 108 performances. The cast included Lee Grant as Raina, Francis Lederer as Bluntschli and Sam Wanamaker as Sergius.
* Marlon Brando&#x27;s final stage appearance was in &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; in 1953. He gathered friends who were fellow actors into a company for a summer stock production. He chose to play Sergius while William Redfield starred as Bluntschli. The show was produced on the college circuit as well in the 1950s.
* Carroll Baker, following her enormous success in Baby Doll, toured in the play in the summer of 1957. 
* The play was produced in 1982 at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, with Brian Bedford as Bluntschli and Len Cariou as Sergius.
* The Studio Arena Theater in Buffalo, New York, put on a production of &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; in 1983 with Kelsey Grammer as Sergius. 
* A Channel 4 television production in 1983 starring Richard Briers as Captain Bluntschli, Peter Egan as Major Sergius Saranoff, Alice Krige as Raina and Anna Nygh as Louka.
* In 1985 John Malkovich directed a revival production at New York City&#x27;s Circle in the Square Theatre starring Kevin Kline as Bluntschli (later replaced by Malkovich after Kline&#x27;s departure), Glenne Headly as Raina and Raul Julia as Sergius. The production ran from 30 May to 1 September 1985, for a total of 109 performances.
* The BBC produced a second made-for-TV version in 1989, directed by James Cellan Jones, starring Helena Bonham Carter as Raina, Pip Torrens as Bluntschli, Patrick Ryecart as Sergius and Patsy Kensit as Louka.
* The 1991 production by Channel Theatre Company opened the Malvern Festival before touring the UK. Directed by Philip Dart it featured Sebastian Abineri, Steven Pinner, Juliette Kaplan, Charles Stapley, Mary Woodvine, Andrew Wheaton, Susan Gott and Colin Atkins.
* In 2011 the play was presented by the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota; The Seattle Public Theater; and the Constellation Theatre Company in Washington, D.C.
* In the summer of 2013, Odyssey Theatre in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada performed a masked performance of this play.
* The Shaw Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, has performed the play a number of times: in 1967, 1976, 1986, 1994, 2006 and 2014, the last directed by Morris Panych.
* The play opened at the American Shakespeare Center&#x27;s Blackfriars Playhouse in Staunton, Virginia, on 29 April 2016 and ran until 11 June.
* In 2023, the play is produced Off-Broadway in New York City at Theatre Row, by Gingold Theatrical Group, and directed by David Staller.

==Adaptations==
*Shaw gave the rights to adapt the play into what became the operetta &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot; (1908) with music by Oscar Straus, but under three conditions: none of Shaw&#x27;s dialogue or character names could be used, the musical version must be advertised as a parody of Shaw&#x27;s play, and Shaw would accept no payment. Nonetheless, the operetta kept Shaw&#x27;s original plot and central message. Shaw despised the result, calling it &quot;a putrid &quot;opéra bouffe&quot; in the worst taste of 1860&quot;, but grew to regret not accepting payment when, despite his opinion, it became a lucrative international success. 
*When Shaw heard, in 1921, that Franz Lehár wanted to set his play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; to music, he sent word to Vienna that Lehár be instructed that he could not touch &quot;Pygmalion&quot; without infringing Shaw&#x27;s copyright and that Shaw had &quot;no intention of allowing the history of &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot; to be repeated.&quot; Only after Shaw&#x27;s death was &quot;Pygmalion&quot; eventually adapted by Lerner and Loewe as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1956).
*A 1932 British film adaptation (now believed lost) was directed by Cecil Lewis. It starred Barry Jones as Bluntschli and Anne Grey as Raina.
*A filmed version of &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; in German entitled &quot;Helden&quot; (&quot;Heroes&quot;) starring O. W. Fischer and Liselotte Pulver was runner up for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1958.
*An audio version was produced by the BBC in 1975 starring Ralph Richardson as Captain Bluntschli, John Gielgud as Major Sergius Saranoff, Vanessa Redgrave as Raina and Judi Dench as Louka.
*A second BBC radio production was produced in 1984 and broadcast on BBC Radio 7 in February 2009 starring Andrew Sachs as Captain Bluntschli, Jackie Smith-Wood as Raina and Gary Bond as Major Saranoff.
*A third BBC Radio production was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 21 March 2010 starring Rory Kinnear as Captain Bluntschli, Lydia Leonard as Raina and Tom Mison as Major Saranoff. This production was produced by Nicolas Soames and directed by David Timson.
*An audio version was produced in 1999 by the CBC starring Simon Bradbury as Captain Bluntschli, Elizabeth Brown as Raina and Andrew Gillies as Major Saranoff.
*Another audio version was produced in 2006 by the L.A. Theatre Works starring Jeremy Sisto as Captain Bluntschli, Anne Heche as Raina and Teri Garr as Catherine.
*A musical by Udo Jürgens, &quot;Helden, Helden&quot;, also based on Shaw&#x27;s play, premiered at the Theater an der Wien, Vienna, Austria in 1973.

==Pejorative military use of &quot;chocolate soldier&quot;==
The chocolate-cream soldier of the play has inspired a pejorative military use of the term. Israeli soldiers use the term &quot;chocolate soldier&quot; (&quot;hayal shel shokolad&quot;, חייל של שוקולד) to disparage a soldier not tough enough to fight. The Australian Citizens Military Force were derided by the regular army as &quot;chokos&quot; or chocolate soldiers, implying they were not real soldiers.

<text>Marcus Annaeus Lucanus (3 November AD 39 – 30 April AD 65), better known in English as Lucan (), was a Roman poet, born in Corduba, Hispania Baetica (present-day Córdoba, Spain). He is regarded as one of the outstanding figures of the Imperial Latin period, known in particular for his epic &quot;Pharsalia&quot;. His youth and speed of composition set him apart from other poets.

==Life==
Three brief ancient accounts allow for the reconstruction of a modest biography – the earliest attributed to Suetonius, another to an otherwise unknown Vacca, and the third anonymous and undated – along with references in Martial, Cassius Dio, Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Annals&quot;, and one of Statius&#x27;s &quot;Silvae&quot;. Lucan was born in the Roman colony of Corduba into a wealthy family of central Italic origins; he was the son of and grandson of Seneca the Elder. He grew up under the tutelage of his uncle Seneca the Younger. He studied rhetoric at Athens and was probably provided with a philosophical and Stoic education by his uncle.
 His wife was Polla Argentaria, who is said to have assisted him with his &quot;Pharsalia&quot;.

He found success under Nero, became one of the emperor&#x27;s close friends and was rewarded with a quaestorship in advance of the legal age. In AD 60, he won a prize for extemporizing &quot;Orpheus&quot; and &quot;Laudes Neronis&quot; at the quinquennial Neronia, and was again rewarded when the emperor appointed him to the augurate. During this time he circulated the first three books of his epic poem &quot;Pharsalia&quot; (labelled &quot;De Bello civili&quot; in the manuscripts), which told the story of the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey.

At some point, a feud began between Nero and Lucan. Two very different accounts of the events have survived that both trivialize the feud. According to Tacitus, Nero became jealous of Lucan and forbade him to publish his poems. According to Suetonius, Nero disrupted a public reading by Lucan, by leaving and calling a meeting of the senate, and Lucan responded by writing insulting poems about Nero.

Other works, though, point to a more serious basis to the feud. Works by the grammarian Vacca and the poet Statius may support the claim that Lucan wrote insulting poems about Nero. Vacca mentions that one of Lucan&#x27;s works was entitled &quot;De Incendio Urbis&quot; (On the Burning of the City). Statius&#x27;s ode to Lucan mentions that Lucan described how the &quot;unspeakable flames of the criminal tyrant roamed the heights of Remus.&quot; Additionally, the later books of &quot;Pharsalia&quot; are anti-Imperial and pro-Republic. This criticism of Nero and office of the Emperor may have been the true cause of the ban.

Lucan later joined the conspiracy of Gaius Calpurnius Piso against Nero. The conspiracy was discovered and he was obliged, at the age of 25, to commit suicide by opening a vein, but not before incriminating his mother, Acilia, among others, in the hopes of a pardon. According to Tacitus, as Lucan bled to death, &quot;(he) recalled some poetry he had composed in which he had told the story of a wounded soldier dying a similar kind of death and he recited the very lines. These were his last words.&quot; An alternative interpretation of events is that his death was not by suicide, but was an execution carried out at Nero&#x27;s command. 

His father was involved in the proscription, but his mother escaped. Statius&#x27;s poem about Lucan was addressed to his widow, Polla Argentaria, upon the occasion of his birthday during the reign of Domitian (&quot;Silvae&quot;, ii.7, the &quot;Genethliacon Lucani&quot;).
==Works==

According to Vacca and Statius, Lucan&#x27;s works included:

Surviving work:
* &quot;Pharsalia&quot; or &quot;De Bello Civili&quot; (On the Civil War), on the wars between Julius Caesar and Pompey

Often attributed to him (but to others as well):
* &quot;Laus Pisonis&quot; (Praise of Piso), a panegyric of a member of the Piso family

<text>In formal language theory, a context-free grammar is in Greibach normal form (GNF) if the right-hand sides of all production rules start with a terminal symbol, optionally followed by some variables. A non-strict form allows one exception to this format restriction for allowing the empty word (epsilon, ε) to be a member of the described language. The normal form was established by Sheila Greibach and it bears her name.

More precisely, a context-free grammar is in Greibach normal form, if all production rules are of the form:
:formula_1

where formula_2 is a nonterminal symbol, formula_3 is a terminal symbol, and
formula_4 is a (possibly empty) sequence of nonterminal symbols.

Observe that the grammar does not have left recursions.

Every context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent grammar in Greibach normal form. Various constructions exist. Some do not permit the second form of rule and cannot transform context-free grammars that can generate the empty word. For one such construction the size of the constructed grammar is O(4) in the general case and O(3) if no derivation of the original grammar consists of a single nonterminal symbol, where is the size of the original grammar. This conversion can be used to prove that every context-free language can be accepted by a real-time (non-deterministic) pushdown automaton, i.e., the automaton reads a letter from its input every step. 

Given a grammar in GNF and a derivable string in the grammar with length , any top-down parser will halt at depth .

<doc id="53929" wikidata="Q954821" url="?curid=53929" title="CYK algorithm">
<text>In computer science, the Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm (alternatively called CYK, or CKY) is a parsing algorithm for context-free grammars published by Itiroo Sakai in 1961. The algorithm is named after some of its rediscoverers: John Cocke, Daniel Younger, Tadao Kasami, and Jacob T. Schwartz. It employs bottom-up parsing and dynamic programming.

The standard version of CYK operates only on context-free grammars given in Chomsky normal form (CNF). However any context-free grammar may be algorithmically transformed into a CNF grammar expressing the same language .

The importance of the CYK algorithm stems from its high efficiency in certain situations. Using big &quot;O&quot; notation, the worst case running time of CYK is formula_1, where formula_2 is the length of the parsed string and formula_3 is the size of the CNF grammar formula_4 . This makes it one of the most efficient parsing algorithms in terms of worst-case asymptotic complexity, although other algorithms exist with better average running time in many practical scenarios.

==Standard form==

The dynamic programming algorithm requires the context-free grammar to be rendered into Chomsky normal form (CNF), because it tests for possibilities to split the current sequence into two smaller sequences. Any context-free grammar that does not generate the empty string can be represented in CNF using only production rules of the forms formula_5 and formula_6; to allow for the empty string, one can explicitly allow formula_7, where formula_8 is the start symbol.

==Algorithm==

===As pseudocode===
The algorithm in pseudocode is as follows:

 let the input be a string &quot;I&quot; consisting of &quot;n&quot; characters: &quot;a&quot;1 ... &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
 let the grammar contain &quot;r&quot; nonterminal symbols &quot;R&quot;1 ... &quot;R&quot;&quot;r&quot;, with start symbol &quot;R&quot;1.
 let &quot;P&quot;[&quot;n&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;r&quot;] be an array of booleans. Initialize all elements of &quot;P&quot; to false.
 let &quot;back&quot;[&quot;n&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;r&quot;] be an array of lists of backpointing triples. Initialize all elements of &quot;back&quot; to the empty list.
 for each &quot;s&quot; = 1 to &quot;n&quot;
 for each unit production &quot;R&quot;&quot;v&quot; → &quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot;
 set &quot;P&quot;[&quot;1&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;v&quot;] = true
 for each &quot;l&quot; = 2 to &quot;n&quot; &quot;-- Length of span&quot;
 for each &quot;s&quot; = 1 to &quot;n&quot;-&quot;l&quot;+1 &quot;-- Start of span&quot;
 for each &quot;p&quot; = 1 to &quot;l&quot;-1 &quot;-- Partition of span&quot;
 for each production &quot;R&quot;&quot;a&quot; → &quot;R&quot;&quot;b&quot; &quot;R&quot;&quot;c&quot;
 if &quot;P&quot;[&quot;p&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] and &quot;P&quot;[&quot;l&quot;-&quot;p&quot;,&quot;s&quot;+&quot;p&quot;,&quot;c&quot;] then
 set &quot;P&quot;[&quot;l&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;a&quot;] = true, 
 append to &quot;back&quot;[&quot;l&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;a&quot;]
 if &quot;P&quot;[n,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;1&quot;] is true then
 &quot;I&quot; is member of language
 return &quot;back&quot; -- by &quot;retracing the steps through back, one can easily construct all possible parse trees of the string.&quot;
 else
 return &quot;not a member of language&quot;

==== Probabilistic CYK (for finding the most probable parse) ====
Allows to recover the most probable parse given the probabilities of all productions.
 let the input be a string &quot;I&quot; consisting of &quot;n&quot; characters: &quot;a&quot;1 ... &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
 let the grammar contain &quot;r&quot; nonterminal symbols &quot;R&quot;1 ... &quot;R&quot;&quot;r&quot;, with start symbol &quot;R&quot;1.
 let &quot;P&quot;[&quot;n&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;r&quot;] be an array of real numbers. Initialize all elements of &quot;P&quot; to zero.
 let &quot;back&quot;[&quot;n&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;r&quot;] be an array of backpointing triples.
 for each &quot;s&quot; = 1 to &quot;n&quot;
 for each unit production &quot;R&quot;&quot;v&quot; →&quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot;
 set &quot;P&quot;[&quot;1&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;v&quot;] = Pr(&quot;R&quot;&quot;v&quot; →&quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot;)
 for each &quot;l&quot; = 2 to &quot;n&quot; &quot;-- Length of span&quot;
 for each &quot;s&quot; = 1 to &quot;n&quot;-&quot;l&quot;+1 &quot;-- Start of span&quot;
 for each &quot;p&quot; = 1 to &quot;l&quot;-1 &quot;-- Partition of span&quot; 
 for each production &quot;R&quot;&quot;a&quot; → &quot;R&quot;&quot;b&quot; &quot;R&quot;&quot;c&quot;
 prob_splitting = Pr(&quot;R&quot;&quot;a&quot; →&quot;R&quot;&quot;b&quot; &quot;R&quot;&quot;c&quot;) * &quot;P&quot;[&quot;p&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] * &quot;P&quot;[&quot;l&quot;-&quot;p&quot;,&quot;s&quot;+&quot;p&quot;,&quot;c&quot;]
 if prob_splitting &gt; &quot;P&quot;[&quot;l&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;a&quot;] then 
 set &quot;P&quot;[&quot;l&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;a&quot;] = prob_splitting
 set &quot;back&quot;[&quot;l&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;a&quot;] = 
 if &quot;P&quot;[n,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;1&quot;] &gt; 0 then
 find the parse tree by retracing through &quot;back&quot;
 return the parse tree
 else
 return &quot;not a member of language&quot;

===As prose===
In informal terms, this algorithm considers every possible substring of the input string and sets formula_9 to be true if the substring of length formula_10 starting from formula_11 can be generated from the nonterminal formula_12. Once it has considered substrings of length 1, it goes on to substrings of length 2, and so on. For substrings of length 2 and greater, it considers every possible partition of the substring into two parts, and checks to see if there is some production formula_13 such that formula_14 matches the first part and formula_15 matches the second part. If so, it records formula_16 as matching the whole substring. Once this process is completed, the input string is generated by the grammar if the substring containing the entire input string is matched by the start symbol.

==Example==

This is an example grammar:

:formula_17

Now the sentence &quot;she eats a fish with a fork&quot; is analyzed using the CYK algorithm. In the following table, in formula_18, is the number of the row (starting at the bottom at 1), and is the number of the column (starting at the left at 1).

For readability, the CYK table for &quot;P&quot; is represented here as a 2-dimensional matrix &quot;M&quot; containing a set of non-terminal symbols, such that is in if, and only if, .
In the above example, since a start symbol &quot;S&quot; is in , the sentence can be generated by the grammar.

==Extensions==

===Generating a parse tree===
The above algorithm is a recognizer that will only determine if a sentence is in the language. It is simple to extend it into a parser that also constructs a parse tree, by storing parse tree nodes as elements of the array, instead of the boolean 1. The node is linked to the array elements that were used to produce it, so as to build the tree structure. Only one such node in each array element is needed if only one parse tree is to be produced. However, if all parse trees of an ambiguous sentence are to be kept, it is necessary to store in the array element a list of all the ways the corresponding node can be obtained in the parsing process. This is sometimes done with a second table B[n,n,r] of so-called &quot;backpointers&quot;.
The end result is then a shared-forest of possible parse trees, where common trees parts are factored between the various parses. This shared forest can conveniently be read as an ambiguous grammar generating only the sentence parsed, but with the same ambiguity as the original grammar, and the same parse trees up to a very simple renaming of non-terminals, as shown by .

===Parsing non-CNF context-free grammars===

As pointed out by , the drawback of all known transformations into Chomsky normal form is that they can lead to an undesirable bloat in grammar size. The size of a grammar is the sum of the sizes of its production rules, where the size of a rule is one plus the length of its right-hand side. Using formula_19 to denote the size of the original grammar, the size blow-up in the worst case may range from formula_20 to formula_21, depending on the transformation algorithm used. For the use in teaching, Lange and Leiß propose a slight generalization of the CYK algorithm, &quot;without compromising efficiency of the algorithm, clarity of its presentation, or simplicity of proofs&quot; .

===Parsing weighted context-free grammars===
It is also possible to extend the CYK algorithm to parse strings using weighted and stochastic context-free grammars. Weights (probabilities) are then stored in the table P instead of booleans, so P[i,j,A] will contain the minimum weight (maximum probability) that the substring from i to j can be derived from A. Further extensions of the algorithm allow all parses of a string to be enumerated from lowest to highest weight (highest to lowest probability).

==== Numerical stability ====
When the probabilistic CYK algorithm is applied to a long string, the splitting probability can become very small due to multiplying many probabilities together. This can be dealt with by summing log-probability instead of multiplying probabilities.

===Valiant&#x27;s algorithm===
The worst case running time of CYK is formula_22, where &quot;n&quot; is the length of the parsed string and |&quot;G&quot;| is the size of the CNF grammar &quot;G&quot;. This makes it one of the most efficient algorithms for recognizing general context-free languages in practice. gave an extension of the CYK algorithm. His algorithm computes the same parsing table
as the CYK algorithm; yet he showed that algorithms for efficient multiplication of matrices with 0-1-entries can be utilized for performing this computation.

Using the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm for multiplying these matrices, this gives an asymptotic worst-case running time of formula_23. However, the constant term hidden by the Big O Notation is so large that the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm is only worthwhile for matrices that are too large to handle on present-day computers , and this approach requires subtraction and so is only suitable for recognition. The dependence on efficient matrix multiplication cannot be avoided altogether: has proved that any parser for context-free grammars working in time formula_24 can be effectively converted into an algorithm computing the product of formula_25-matrices with 0-1-entries in time formula_26, and this was extended by Abboud et al. to apply to a constant-size grammar.

<doc id="53930" wikidata="Q6511" url="?curid=53930" title="Ulysses (novel)">
<text>Ulysses is a modernist novel by the Irish writer James Joyce. Partially serialized in the American journal &quot;The Little Review&quot; from March 1918 to December 1920, the entire work was published in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce&#x27;s fortieth birthday. It is considered one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called &quot;a demonstration and summation of the entire movement&quot;.

The novel chronicles the experiences of three Dubliners over the course of a single day, 16 June 1904, which fans of the novel now celebrate as Bloomsday. Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between Leopold Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus. There are also correspondences with Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and with other literary and mythological figures, including Jesus, Elijah, Moses, Dante, and Don Giovanni. Such themes as antisemitism, human sexuality, British rule in Ireland, Catholicism, and Irish nationalism are treated in the context of early 20th-century Dublin. The novel is highly allusive and written in a variety of styles.

Artist and writer Djuna Barnes quoted Joyce as saying, &quot;The pity is ... the public will demand and find a moral in my book—or worse they may take it in some more serious way, and on the honour of a gentleman, there is not one single serious line in it. ... In &quot;Ulysses&quot; I have recorded, simultaneously, what a man says, sees, thinks, and what such seeing, thinking, saying does, to what you Freudians call the subconscious.&quot;

According to the writer Declan Kiberd, &quot;Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking&quot;. The novel&#x27;s stream of consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose—replete with puns, parodies, epiphanies, and allusions—as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works. Since its publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from a 1921 obscenity trial in the United States to protracted disputes about the authoritative version of the text.

==Background==
Joyce first encountered the figure of Odysseus/Ulysses in Charles Lamb&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Ulysses&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; for children, which seems to have established the Latin name in Joyce&#x27;s mind. At school he wrote an essay on the character, titled &quot;My Favourite Hero&quot;. Joyce told Frank Budgen that he considered Ulysses the only all-round character in literature. He considered writing another short story for &quot;Dubliners&quot;, to be titled &quot;Ulysses&quot; and based on a Jewish Dubliner named Alfred H. Hunter, a putative cuckold. The idea grew from a story in 1906, to a &quot;short book&quot; in 1907, to the vast novel he began in 1914.

==Locations==
The action of the novel moves from one side of Dublin Bay to the other, opening in Sandycove to the south of the city and closing on Howth Head to the north. The plot of the first three chapters, along with chapter 12, &quot;Nausicaa&quot;, takes place on the shores of Dublin Bay, off the map.

# Leopold Bloom&#x27;s home at 7 Eccles Street is the setting of episode 4 (&quot;Calypso&quot;), episode 17 (&quot;Ithaca&quot;), and episode 18 (&quot;Penelope&quot;).
# The post office on Westland Row is the setting of episode 5 (&quot;Lotus Eaters&quot;).
# Sweny&#x27;s Pharmacy on Lombard Street, where Bloom purchases soap, and Lincoln Place are also settings of episode 5 (&quot;Lotus Eaters&quot;).
# The Freeman&#x27;s Journal on Prince&#x27;s Street, off of O&#x27;Connell Street, is the setting of episode 7 (&quot;Aeolus&quot;).
# Davy Byrne&#x27;s pub serves as the setting of episode 8 (&quot;Lestrygonians&quot;).
# The National Library of Ireland is the setting of episode 9 (&quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot;).
# Ormond Hotel on the banks of the Liffey is the setting of episode 11 (&quot;Sirens&quot;).
# Barney Kiernan&#x27;s pub serves as the setting of episode 12 (&quot;Cyclops&quot;).
# The Holles Street Maternity Hospital is the setting of episode 14 (&quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot;).
# Bella Cohen&#x27;s brothel on 82 Tyrone Street Lower is the setting of episode 15 (&quot;Circe&quot;).
# A cabman&#x27;s shelter at Butt Bridge is the setting of episode 16 (&quot;Eumaeus&quot;).

The orange line on the map shows the route of Paddy Dignam&#x27;s carriage ride from episode 6 (&quot;Hades&quot;). The Viceroy&#x27;s journey in episode 10 (&quot;The Wandering Rocks&quot;) appears in blue. Bloom and Steven&#x27;s route in episode 18 (&quot;Penelope&quot;) appears in red.

==Structure==

&quot;Ulysses&quot; is divided into the three books (marked I, II, and III) and 18 episodes. The episodes do not have chapter headings or titles, and are numbered only in Gabler&#x27;s edition. In the various editions, the breaks between episodes are indicated in different ways; in the Modern Library edition, for example, each episode begins at the top of a new page.

Joyce seems to have relished his book&#x27;s obscurity, saying he had &quot;put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that&#x27;s the only way of ensuring [sic] one&#x27;s immortality&quot;. The judge who decided that &quot;Ulysses&quot; was not obscene admitted that it &quot;is not an easy book to read or to understand&quot;, and advised reading &quot;a number of other books which have now become its satellites&quot;. One such book available at the time was Herbert Gorman&#x27;s first book on Joyce, which included his own brief list of correspondences between &quot;Ulysses&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Another was Stuart Gilbert&#x27;s study of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which included a schema of the novel Joyce created. Gilbert was later quoted in the legal brief prepared for the obscenity trial. Joyce had already sent Carlo Linati a different schema. The Gilbert and Linati schemata made the links to the &quot;Odyssey&quot; clearer and also explained the work&#x27;s structure.

===Joyce and Homer===
The 18 episodes of &quot;Ulysses&quot; &quot;roughly correspond to the episodes in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;&quot;. In Homer&#x27;s epic, Odysseus, &quot;a Greek hero of the Trojan War ... took ten years to find his way from Troy to his home on the island of Ithaca&quot;. Homer&#x27;s poem includes violent storms and a shipwreck, giants, monsters, gods, and goddesses, while Joyce&#x27;s novel takes place during an ordinary day in early 20th-century Dublin. Leopold Bloom, &quot;a Jewish advertisement canvasser&quot;, corresponds to Odysseus in Homer&#x27;s epic; Stephen Dedalus, the protagonist of Joyce&#x27;s earlier, largely autobiographical &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, corresponds to Odysseus&#x27;s son Telemachus; and Bloom&#x27;s wife Molly corresponds to Penelope, Odysseus&#x27;s wife, who waited 20 years for him to return.

&quot;The Odyssey&quot; is divided into 24 books, which are divided into 3 parts of 4, 8, and 12 books. Although &quot;Ulysses&quot; has fewer episodes, their division into 3 parts of 3, 12, and 3 episodes is determined by the tripartite division of &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. Joyce referred to the episodes by their Homeric titles in his letters. The novel&#x27;s text does not include the episode titles used below, which originate from the Linati and Gilbert schemata. Joyce scholars have drawn upon both to identify and explain the parallels between &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey&quot;.

Scholars have argued that Victor Bérard&#x27;s , which Joyce discovered in Zurich while writing &quot;Ulysses&quot;, influenced his creation of the novel&#x27;s Homeric parallels. Bérard&#x27;s theory that &quot;The Odyssey&quot; had Semitic roots accords with Joyce&#x27;s reincarnation of Odysseus as the Jewish Leopold Bloom.

Ezra Pound regarded the Homeric correspondences as &quot;a scaffold, a means of construction, justified by the result, and justifiable by it only. The result is a triumph in form, in balance, a main schema with continuous weaving and arabesque.&quot; For T. S. Eliot, the Homeric correspondences had &quot;the importance of a scientific discovery&quot;. He wrote, &quot;In manipulating a continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity ... Mr. Joyce is pursing a method which others must pursue after him.&quot; This method &quot;is simply a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history&quot;.

Edmund Wilson wrote, &quot;The adventures of Ulysses ... do represent the ordinary man in nearly every common relation. Yet I cannot but feel that Mr. Joyce made a mistake to have the whole plan of his story depend on the structure of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; rather than on the natural demands of the situation. ... His taste for symbolism is closely allied with his extraordinary poetic faculty for investing particular incidents with universal significance, nevertheless ... it sometimes overruns the bounds of art into an arid ingenuity which would make a mystic correspondence do duty for an artistic reason. The result is that one sometimes feels as if the brilliant succession of episodes were taking place on the periphery of a wheel which has no hub.&quot;

In the late 1930s, Joyce told Samuel Beckett, &quot;I may have over systematized &quot;Ulysses&quot;.&quot; Around 1937, in a conversation with Vladimir Nabokov, Joyce disparaged the use of mythology in modern literature. Nabokov replied, &quot;But you employed Homer!&quot; &quot;A whim&quot;, Joyce said. When Nabokov pointed to his collaboration with Stuart Gilbert, Joyce replied, &quot;A terrible mistake ... an advertisement for the book. I regret it very much.&quot;

The American literary scholar William York Tindall has written, &quot;Joyce considered Homer&#x27;s myth the complete expression of man. ... Exile, home, humanity, and art, Joyce&#x27;s concerns, found expression in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. ... But the Homeric pattern is only one level of the narrative Joyce composed. Another level is the Christian pattern. ... Bloom is not only Odysseus but Jesus-God. These traditional beliefs, however, are less important that the main level of Joyce&#x27;s myth: the story of Stephen Dedalus and Mr. Bloom in Dublin or the present, the particular, and the personal. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a narrative composition of three levels, to which, by allusion, Joyce added others of less importance. His myth is not the &quot;Odyssey&quot; but &quot;Ulysses&quot;.&quot;

===Joyce and Shakespeare===

After Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the literary work &quot;Ulysses&quot; parallels most closely is Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The play is mentioned in &quot;Telemachus&quot;. &quot;Hamlet&quot; is a symbol in the Linati schema. In the Library episode, Stephen Dedalus puts forth a theory of &quot;Hamlet&quot; based on 12 lectures, now lost, that Joyce gave in Trieste in 1912. Chief among the implied parallels with &quot;Ulysses&quot; are Shakespeare and Joyce, King Hamlet and Leopold Bloom, and Prince Hamlet and Stephen.

According to Stephen, Shakespeare has a double presence in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The king is the mature Shakespeare; the prince is Shakespeare as a young man. Stephen&#x27;s insistence on Shakespeare&#x27;s double presence in &quot;Hamlet&quot; hints at Joyce&#x27;s double presence in &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Bloom is the mature Joyce; Stephen is Joyce as a young man. Other parallels with &quot;Hamlet&quot; include Gertrude and Molly Bloom, Claudius and Buck Mulligan, and Claudius and Blazes Boylan.

Like Shakespeare, Dante was a major influence on Joyce. It has been argued that the interrelationship of Joyce, Dedalus, and Bloom is defined in the Incarnation doctrines Stephen lists in &quot;Telemachus&quot;.

==Plot summary==

===Part I: Telemachia===

====Episode 1, &quot;Telemachus&quot;====

At 8 a.m., Malachi &quot;Buck&quot; Mulligan, a boisterous medical student, calls aspiring writer Stephen Dedalus up to the roof of the Sandycove Martello tower, where they live. There is tension between Dedalus and Mulligan stemming from a cruel remark Dedalus overheard Mulligan make about his recently deceased mother and from the fact that Mulligan has invited an English student, Haines, to stay with them. The three men eat breakfast and walk to the shore, where Mulligan demands from Stephen the key to the tower and a loan. The three make plans to meet at a pub, The Ship, at 12:30pm. Departing, Stephen decides that he will not return to the tower that night, as Mulligan, the &quot;usurper&quot;, has taken it over.

====Episode 2, &quot;Nestor&quot;====
Stephen is teaching a history class on the victories of Pyrrhus of Epirus. After class, one student, Cyril Sargent, stays behind so that Stephen can show him how to do a set of algebraic exercises. Stephen looks at Sargent&#x27;s ugly face and tries to imagine Sargent&#x27;s mother&#x27;s love for him. He then visits unionist school headmaster Garrett Deasy, from whom he collects his pay. Deasy asks Stephen to take his long-winded letter about foot-and-mouth disease to a newspaper office for printing. The two discuss Irish history and Deasy lectures on what he believes is the role of Jews in the economy. As Stephen leaves, Deasy jokes that Ireland has &quot;never persecuted the Jews&quot; because the country &quot;never let them in&quot;. This episode is the source of some of the novel&#x27;s best-known lines, such as Dedalus&#x27;s claim that &quot;history is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake&quot; and that God is &quot;a shout in the street&quot;.

====Episode 3, &quot;Proteus&quot;====

Stephen walks along Sandymount Strand for some time, mulling various philosophical concepts, his family, his life as a student in Paris, and his mother&#x27;s death. As he reminisces he lies down among some rocks, watches a couple whose dog urinates behind a rock, scribbles some ideas for poetry and picks his nose. This chapter is characterised by a stream of consciousness narrative style that changes focus wildly. Stephen&#x27;s education is reflected in the many obscure references and foreign phrases employed in this episode, which have earned it a reputation for being one of the book&#x27;s most difficult chapters.

===Part II: Odyssey===

====Episode 4, &quot;Calypso&quot;====
The narrative shifts abruptly. The time is again 8 a.m., but the action has moved across the city and to the second protagonist of the book, Leopold Bloom, a part-Jewish advertising canvasser. The episode opens with the line &quot;Mr. Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.&quot; After starting to prepare breakfast, Bloom decides to walk to a butcher to buy a mutton kidney. Returning home, he prepares breakfast and brings it with the mail to his wife Molly as she lounges in bed. One of the letters is from her concert manager Blazes Boylan, with whom she is having an affair. Bloom reads a letter from their daughter Milly Bloom, who tells him about her progress in the photography business in Mullingar. The episode closes with Bloom reading a magazine story titled &quot;Matcham&#x27;s Masterstroke&quot;, by Mr. Philip Beaufoy, while defecating in the outhouse.

====Episode 5, &quot;Lotus Eaters&quot;====
While making his way to Westland Row post office Bloom is tormented by the knowledge that Molly will welcome Boylan into her bed later that day. At the post office he surreptitiously collects a love letter from one &#x27;Martha Clifford&#x27; addressed to his pseudonym, &#x27;Henry Flower&#x27;. He meets an acquaintance, and while they chat, Bloom attempts to ogle a woman wearing stockings, but is prevented by a passing tram. Next, he reads the letter from Martha Clifford and tears up the envelope in an alley. He wanders into a Catholic church during a service and muses on theology. The priest has the letters I.N.R.I. or I.H.S. on his back; Molly had told Bloom that they meant &quot;I have sinned&quot; or &quot;I have suffered&quot;, and &quot;Iron nails ran in&quot;. He buys a bar of lemon soap from a chemist. He then meets another acquaintance, Bantam Lyons, who mistakenly takes him to be offering a racing tip for the horse &quot;Throwaway&quot;. Finally, Bloom heads towards the baths.

====Episode 6, &quot;Hades&quot;====
The episode begins with Bloom entering a funeral carriage with three others, including Stephen&#x27;s father. They drive to Paddy Dignam&#x27;s funeral, making small talk on the way. The carriage passes both Stephen and Blazes Boylan. There is discussion of various forms of death and burial. Bloom is preoccupied by thoughts of his dead infant son, Rudy, and the suicide of his own father. They enter the chapel for the service and subsequently leave with the coffin cart. Bloom sees a mysterious man wearing a mackintosh during the burial. Bloom continues to reflect upon death, but at the end of the episode rejects morbid thoughts to embrace &quot;warm fullblooded life&quot;.

====Episode 7, &quot;Aeolus&quot;====
At the office of the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, Bloom attempts to place an ad. Although initially encouraged by the editor, he is unsuccessful. Stephen arrives bringing Deasy&#x27;s letter about foot-and-mouth disease, but Stephen and Bloom do not meet. Stephen leads the editor and others to a pub, relating an anecdote on the way about &quot;two Dublin vestals&quot;. The episode is broken into short segments by newspaper-style headlines, and is characterised by an abundance of rhetorical figures and devices.

====Episode 8, &quot;Lestrygonians&quot;====

Bloom&#x27;s thoughts are peppered with references to food as lunchtime approaches. He meets an old flame, hears news of Mina Purefoy&#x27;s labour, and helps a blind boy cross the street. He enters the restaurant of the Burton Hotel, where he is revolted by the sight of men eating like animals. He goes instead to Davy Byrne&#x27;s pub, where he consumes a gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of burgundy, and muses upon the early days of his relationship with Molly and how the marriage has declined: &quot;Me. And me now.&quot; Bloom&#x27;s thoughts touch on what goddesses and gods eat and drink. He ponders whether the statues of Greek goddesses in the National Museum have anuses as do mortals. On leaving the pub Bloom heads toward the museum, but spots Boylan across the street and, panicking, rushes into the gallery across the street from the museum.

====Episode 9, &quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot;====

At the National Library, Stephen explains to some scholars his biographical theory of the works of Shakespeare, especially &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which he argues are based largely on the posited adultery of Shakespeare&#x27;s wife. Buck Mulligan arrives and interrupts to read out the telegram that Stephen had sent him indicating that he would not make their planned rendezvous at The Ship. Bloom enters the National Library to look up an old copy of the ad he has been trying to place. He passes in between Stephen and Mulligan as they exit the library at the end of the episode.

====Episode 10, &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot;====
In this episode, nineteen short vignettes depict the movements of various characters, major and minor, through the streets of Dublin. The episode begins by following Father Conmee, a Jesuit priest, on his trip north, and ends with an account of the cavalcade of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, William Ward, Earl of Dudley, through the streets, which is encountered by several characters from the novel.

====Episode 11, &quot;Sirens&quot;====
In this episode, dominated by motifs of music, Bloom has dinner with Stephen&#x27;s uncle at the Ormond hotel, while Molly&#x27;s lover, Blazes Boylan, proceeds to his rendezvous with her. While dining, Bloom listens to the singing of Stephen&#x27;s father and others, watches the seductive barmaids, and composes a reply to Martha Clifford&#x27;s letter.

====Episode 12, &quot;Cyclops&quot;====
This episode is narrated by an unnamed denizen of Dublin who works as a debt collector. The narrator goes to Barney Kiernan&#x27;s pub where he meets a character referred to only as &quot;The Citizen&quot;. This character is believed to be a satirisation of Michael Cusack, a founder member of the Gaelic Athletic Association. When Leopold Bloom enters the pub, he is berated by the Citizen, who is a fierce Fenian and anti-Semite. The episode ends with Bloom reminding the Citizen that his Savior was a Jew. As Bloom leaves the pub, the Citizen throws a biscuit tin at Bloom&#x27;s head, but misses. The episode is marked by extended tangents made in voices other than that of the unnamed narrator; these include streams of legal jargon, a report of a boxing match, Biblical passages, and elements of Irish mythology.

====Episode 13, &quot;Nausicaa&quot;====
All the action of the episode takes place on the rocks of Sandymount Strand, the shoreline that Stephen visited in Episode 3. A young woman, Gerty MacDowell, is seated on the rocks with her two friends, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman. The girls are taking care of three children, a baby, and four-year-old twins named Tommy and Jacky. Gerty contemplates love, marriage and femininity as night falls. The reader is gradually made aware that Bloom is watching her from a distance. Gerty teases the onlooker by exposing her legs and underwear, and Bloom, in turn, masturbates. Bloom&#x27;s masturbatory climax is echoed by the fireworks at the nearby bazaar. As Gerty leaves, Bloom realises that she has a lame leg, and believes this is the reason she has been &quot;left on the shelf&quot;. After several mental digressions he decides to visit Mina Purefoy at the maternity hospital. It is uncertain how much of the episode is Gerty&#x27;s thoughts, and how much is Bloom&#x27;s sexual fantasy. Some believe that the episode is divided into two halves: the first half the highly romanticized viewpoint of Gerty, and the other half that of the older and more realistic Bloom. Joyce himself said, however, that &quot;nothing happened between [Gerty and Bloom]. It all took place in Bloom&#x27;s imagination&quot;. &quot;Nausicaa&quot; attracted immense notoriety while the book was being published in serial form. It has also attracted great attention from scholars of disability in literature. The style of the first half of the episode borrows from (and parodies) romance magazines and novelettes. Bloom&#x27;s contemplation of Gerty parodies Dedalus&#x27;s vision of the wading girl at the seashore in &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;.

====Episode 14, &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot;====
Bloom visits the maternity hospital where Mina Purefoy is giving birth, and finally meets Stephen, who has been drinking with his medical student friends and is awaiting the promised arrival of Buck Mulligan. As the only father in the group of men, Bloom is concerned about Mina Purefoy in her labour. He starts thinking about his wife and the births of his two children. He also thinks about the loss of his only &#x27;heir&#x27;, Rudy. The young men become boisterous, and start discussing such topics as fertility, contraception and abortion. There is also a suggestion that Milly, Bloom&#x27;s daughter, is in a relationship with one of the young men, Bannon. They continue on to a pub to continue drinking, following the successful birth of a son to Mina Purefoy. This chapter is remarkable for Joyce&#x27;s wordplay, which, among other things, recapitulates the entire history of the English language. After a short incantation, the episode starts with latinate prose, Anglo-Saxon alliteration, and moves on through parodies of, among others, Malory, the King James Bible, Bunyan, Pepys, Defoe, Sterne, Walpole, Gibbon, Dickens, and Carlyle, before concluding in a Joycean version of contemporary slang. The development of the English language in the episode is believed to be aligned with the nine-month gestation period of the foetus in the womb.

====Episode 15, &quot;Circe&quot;====
Episode 15 is written as a play script, complete with stage directions. The plot is frequently interrupted by &quot;hallucinations&quot; experienced by Stephen and Bloom—fantastic manifestations of the fears and passions of the two characters. Stephen and his friend Lynch walk into Nighttown, Dublin&#x27;s red-light district. Bloom pursues them and eventually finds them at Bella Cohen&#x27;s brothel where, in the company of her workers including Zoe Higgins, Florry Talbot and Kitty Ricketts, he has a series of hallucinations regarding his sexual fetishes, fantasies and transgressions. In one of these hallucinations, Bloom is put in the dock to answer charges by a variety of sadistic, accusing women including Mrs Yelverton Barry, Mrs Bellingham and the Hon Mrs Mervyn Talboys. In another of Bloom&#x27;s hallucinations, he is crowned king of his own city, which is called Bloomusalem—Bloom imagines himself being loved and admired by Bloomusalem&#x27;s citizens, but then imagines himself being accused of various charges. As a result, he is burnt at the stake and several citizens pay their respects to him as he dies.

Then the hallucination ends, Bloom finds himself next to Zoe, and the two talk. After they talk, Bloom continues to encounter other miscellaneous hallucinations, including one in which he converses with his grandfather Lipoti Virag, who lectures him about sex, among other things. At the end of the hallucination, Bloom is speaking with some prostitutes when he hears a sound coming from downstairs. He hears heels clacking on the staircase, and he observes what appears to be a male form passing down the staircase. He speaks with Zoe and Kitty for a moment, and then sees Bella Cohen come into the brothel. He observes her appearance and talks with her for a little while. But this conversation subsequently begins another hallucination, in which Bloom imagines Bella to be a man named Mr. Bello and Bloom imagines himself to be a woman. In this fantasy, Bloom imagines himself (or &quot;herself&quot;, in the hallucination) being dominated by Bello, who both sexually and verbally humiliates Bloom. Bloom also interacts with other imaginary characters in this scene before the hallucination ends.

After the hallucination ends, Bloom sees Stephen overpay at the brothel, and decides to hold onto the rest of Stephen&#x27;s money for safekeeping. Stephen hallucinates that his mother&#x27;s rotting cadaver has risen up from the floor to confront him. He cries &quot;Non serviam!&quot;, uses his walking stick to smash a chandelier, and flees the room. Bloom quickly pays Bella for the damage, then runs after Stephen. He finds Stephen engaged in an argument with an English soldier, Private Carr, who, after hearing Stephen utter a perceived insult to King Edward VII, punches him. The police arrive and the crowd disperses. As Bloom tends to Stephen, he has a hallucination of his deceased son, Rudy, as an 11-year-old.

===Part III: Nostos===
====Episode 16, &quot;Eumaeus&quot;====
Bloom takes Stephen to a cabman&#x27;s shelter near Butt Bridge to restore him to his senses. There, they encounter a drunken sailor, D. B. Murphy (W. B. Murphy in the 1922 text). The episode is dominated by the motif of confusion and mistaken identity, with Bloom, Stephen and Murphy&#x27;s identities being repeatedly called into question. The narrative&#x27;s rambling and laboured style in this episode reflects the protagonists&#x27; nervous exhaustion and confusion.

====Episode 17, &quot;Ithaca&quot;====
Bloom returns home with Stephen, makes him a cup of cocoa, discusses cultural and linguistic differences between them, considers the possibility of publishing Stephen&#x27;s parable stories, and offers him a place to stay for the night. Stephen refuses Bloom&#x27;s offer and is ambiguous in response to Bloom&#x27;s proposal of future meetings. The two men urinate in the backyard, Stephen departs and wanders off into the night, and Bloom goes to bed, where Molly is sleeping. She awakens and questions him about his day. The episode is written in the form of a rigidly organised and &quot;mathematical&quot; catechism of 309 questions and answers, and was reportedly Joyce&#x27;s favourite episode in the novel. The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination and include a list of 25 men that purports to be the &quot;preceding series&quot; of Molly&#x27;s suitors and Bloom&#x27;s reflections on them. While describing events apparently chosen randomly in ostensibly precise mathematical or scientific terms, the episode is rife with errors made by the undefined narrator, many or most of which are intentional by Joyce.

====Episode 18, &quot;Penelope&quot;====
The final episode consists of Molly Bloom&#x27;s thoughts as she lies in bed next to her husband. The episode uses a stream-of-consciousness technique in eight paragraphs and lacks punctuation. Molly thinks about Boylan and Bloom, her past admirers, including Lieutenant Stanley G. Gardner, the events of the day, her childhood in Gibraltar, and her curtailed singing career. She also hints at a lesbian relationship in her youth, with a childhood friend, Hester Stanhope. These thoughts are occasionally interrupted by distractions, such as a train whistle or the need to urinate. Molly is surprised by the early arrival of her menstrual period, which she ascribes to her vigorous sex with Boylan. The episode concludes with Molly&#x27;s remembrance of Bloom&#x27;s marriage proposal, and of her acceptance: &quot;he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.&quot;

==Reception==
===Censorship===

Written over a seven-year period from 1914 to 1921, &quot;Ulysses&quot; was serialised in the American journal &quot;The Little Review&quot; from 1918 to 1920, when the publication of the &quot;Nausicaa&quot; episode led to a prosecution for obscenity under the Comstock Act of 1873, which made it illegal to circulate materials deemed obscene in the U.S. mail. In 1919, sections of the novel also appeared in the London literary journal &quot;The Egoist&quot;, but the novel itself was banned in the United Kingdom until 1936. Joyce had resolved that the book would be published on his 40th birthday, 2 February 1922, and Sylvia Beach, Joyce&#x27;s publisher in Paris, received the first three copies from the printer that morning.

The 1920 prosecution in the US was brought after &quot;The Little Review&quot; serialised a passage of the book depicting characters masturbating. Three earlier chapters had been banned by the US Post Office, but it was Secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice John S. Sumner who instigated this legal action. The Post Office did partially suppress the &quot;Nausicaa&quot; edition of &quot;The Little Review&quot;. Legal historian Edward de Grazia has argued that few readers would have been fully aware of the masturbation in the text, given the metaphoric language. Irene Gammel extends this argument to suggest that the obscenity allegations brought against &quot;The Little Review&quot; were influenced by the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven&#x27;s more explicit poetry, which had appeared alongside the serialization of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. At the trial in 1921 the magazine was declared obscene and, as a result, &quot;Ulysses&quot; was effectively banned in the United States. Throughout the 1920s, the United States Post Office Department burned copies of the novel.

In 1932, Random House and lawyer Morris Ernst arranged to import the French edition and have a copy seized by Customs. Random House contested the seizure, and in &quot;United States v. One Book Called Ulysses&quot;, U.S. District Judge John M. Woolsey ruled that the book was not pornographic and therefore could not be obscene, a decision Stuart Gilbert called &quot;epoch-making&quot;. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling in 1934. The U.S. thus became the first English-speaking country where the book was freely available. Although Ireland&#x27;s Censorship of Publications Board never banned &quot;Ulysses&quot;, a customs loophole prevented it from being allowed into Ireland. It was first openly available in Ireland in the 1960s.

===Critical reception===
In 1922, Ezra Pound wrote, &quot;All men should &#x27;Unite to give praise to &quot;Ulysses&quot;&#x27;; those who will not, may content themselves with a place in the lower intellectual orders.&quot; He claimed that in writing &quot;Ulysses&quot;, &quot;this super-novel&quot;, Joyce surpassed Gustave Flaubert, Miguel de Cervantes, Henry James, and Marcel Proust, concluding that, besides François Rabelais, he &quot;can think of no other prose writer whose proportional status in pan-literature is not modified by the advent of &quot;Ulysses&quot;&quot;.

In a 1922 review in &quot;The Outlook&quot;, the British novelist Arnold Bennett expressed his lack of admiration for Joyce detailing one day in 700 pages. He wrote, &quot;Given sufficient time, paper, childish caprice, and obstinacy, one might easily write over seven thousand pages about twenty hours of life.&quot; Bennett also opposed Valery Larbaud&#x27;s view that Joyce elaborately planned and organized the day he wrote about. He wrote that Joyce &quot;apparently thinks there is something truly artistic and high minded in playing the lout to the innocent and defenseless reader. As a fact, there isn&#x27;t ... After all, to comprehend &quot;Ulysses&quot; is not among the recognized learned professions, and nobody should give his entire existence to the job.&quot; Bennett acknowledged that Joyce&#x27;s &quot;verbal method can be justified&quot; since he is &quot;trying to reproduce the thoughts of personage&quot;, but called the details &quot;trivial and perfectly futile in the narrative&quot;.

In April 1922, writing in &quot;The Nation and Athenaeum&quot;, English writer John Middleton Murry called Joyce &quot;a genius of the very highest order, strictly comparable to Goethe or Dostoevsky…&quot;Ulysses&quot; is, fundamentally (though it is much else besides), an immense, a prodigious self-laceration, the tearing away from himself, by a half-demented man of genius, of inhibitions and limitations which have grown to be flesh of his flesh…Mr. Joyce has made the superhuman effort to empty the whole of his consciousness into it…[But he has become] the victim of his own anarchy….[Joyce] is the man with the bomb who would blow what remains of Europe into the sky…This transcendental buffoonery, this sudden uprush of the &quot;vis comica &quot;into a world where in the tragic incompatibility of the practical and the instinctive is embodied, is a very great achievement.&quot;

The next month, in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, newspaper editor James Douglas called &quot;Ulysses&quot; &quot;the most infamously obscene book in ancient or modern literature. ... All the secret sewers of vice are canalized in its flood of unimaginable thoughts, images and pornographic words. And its unclean lunacies are larded with appalling and revolting blasphemies directed against the Christian religion and against the name of Christ—blasphemies hitherto associated with the most degraded orgies of Satanism and the Black Mass.&quot; 

In a 1922 review in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, literary critic Edmund Wilson wrote, &quot;&quot;Ulysses&quot; is a work of high genius. Its importance seems to me to lie ... in its once more setting the standard of the novel so high that it need not be ashamed to take its place beside poetry and drama. &quot;Ulysses&quot; has the effect at once of making everything else look brassy. Since I have read it, the texture of other novelists seems intolerably loose and careless; when I come suddenly unawares upon a page that I have written myself I quake like a guilty thing surprised. ... Who else has had the supreme devotion and accomplished the definitive beauty? If he has really laid down his pen never to take it up again he must know that the hand which laid it down upon the great affirmative of Mrs. Bloom, though it never write another word, is already the hand of a master.&quot;

In a 1922 review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Joseph Collins wrote, &quot;&quot;Ulysses&quot; is the most important contribution that has been made to fictional literature in the twentieth century. ... It is likely that there is no one writing English today that could parallel Mr. Joyce&#x27;s feat, and it is also likely that few would care to do it were they capable. ... When a master technician of words and phrases sets himself the task of revealing the product of the unconscious mind of a moral monster, a pervert and an invert, an apostate to his race and his religion, the simulacrum of a man who has neither cultural background nor personal self-respect, who can neither be taught by experience nor lessoned by example, as Mr. Joyce has done in drawing the picture of Leopold Bloom, and giving a faithful reproduction of his thoughts, purposeful, vagrant and obsessive, he undoubtedly knew full well what he was undertaking, and how unacceptable the vile contents of that unconscious mind would be to ninety-nine men out of a hundred, and how incensed they would be at having the disgusting product thrown in their faces. But that has nothing to do with that with which I am here concerned, viz., has the job been done well and is it a work of art, to which there can be only an affirmative answer.&quot;

In 1922, the writer and Irish nationalist Shane Leslie called &quot;Ulysses&quot; &quot;literary Bolshevism ... experimental, anti-conventional, anti-Christian, chaotic, totally unmoral&quot;. In the same year, Sisley Huddleston wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot;: &quot;I confess that I cannot see how the work upon which Mr Joyce spent seven strenuous years, years of wrestling and of agony, can ever be given to the public. ... This is undoubtedly an obscene book; but that, says Mr Joyce, is not his fault. If the thoughts of men and women are such as may be properly described as obscene then how can you show what life is unless you put in the obscenity.&quot; Molly Bloom&#x27;s monologue, Leslie wrote, is &quot;the vilest [chapter] according to ordinary standards, in all literature. And yet its very obscenity is somehow beautiful and wrings the soul to pity. Is that not high art? I cannot, however, believe that sex plays such a preponderant part in life as Mr Joyce represents. He may aim at putting everything in, but he has, of course, like everybody else, selected carefully what he puts in. Has he not exaggerated the vulgarity and magnified the madness of mankind and the mysterious materiality of the universe?&quot; 

In a 1923 review, Virginia Woolf wrote, &quot;&quot;Ulysses&quot; was a memorable catastrophe—immense in daring, terrific in disaster.&quot; In &quot;The Dial&quot; the same year, T. S. Eliot wrote: &quot;I hold [&quot;Ulysses&quot;] to be the most important expression which the present age has found; it is a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.&quot; He added that Joyce was not at fault if people after him did not understand it: &quot;The next generation is responsible for its own soul; a man of genius is responsible to his peers, not to a studio full of uneducated and undisciplined coxcombs.&quot;

In his 1930 book-length study of the novel, Stuart Gilbert said that the &quot;personages of &quot;Ulysses&quot; are &quot;not&quot; fictitious&quot; but that &quot;these people are as they must be; they act, we see, according to some &quot;lex eterna&quot;, an ineluctable condition of their very existence&quot;. Through these characters Joyce &quot;achieves a coherent and integral interpretation of life&quot;.

In &quot;Axel&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1931), Edmund Wilson noted that &quot;Ulysses&quot; attempts to render &quot;as precisely and as directly as it is possible in words to do, what our participation in life is like—or rather, what it seems to us like as from moment to moment we live&quot;.

Addressing the first All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers in 1934, the writer and communist revolutionary Karl Radek called &quot;Ulysses&quot; &quot;a heap of dung, crawling with worms, photographed by a cinema camera through a microscope&quot;. Writing in &quot;America&quot; magazine that year, Francis X. Talbot vehemently decried Judge Woolsey&#x27;s recent decision that &quot;Ulysses&quot; was not obscene, adding, &quot;Only a person who had been a Catholic, only one with an incurably diseased mind, could be so diabolically venomous toward God, toward the Blessed Sacrament, toward the Virgin Mary.&quot;

In &quot;Irish Literary Portraits&quot; (1935), John Eglinton characterized &quot;Ulysses&quot; as an act of revenge: &quot;I am convinced that the only person concerned in the narrative who comes out as a real hero is the author himself. What kind of hero after all is brought to mind by the name Ulysses if not a hero long absent from his kingdom, returning, after being the sport of the gods for ten years, in triumph and vengeance? And it was after nearly as many years of absence as Ulysses from the country &#x27;which belonged to him&#x27; that Joyce turned up again for us in Dublin, with a vengeance! ... Endued ... with the elemental diabolism of Ulysses, he was transfigured. A thousand unexpected faculties and gay devices were liberated in his soul. The discovery of a new method in literary art, in which the pen is no longer the slave of logic and rhetoric, made of this Berlitz School teacher a kind of public danger, threatening to the corporate existence of &#x27;literature&#x27; as established in the minds and affections of the older generation. ... Our Romano-Celtic Joyce nurses an ironic detachment from the whole of the English tradition. Indeed, he is its enemy. ... It must have seemed to him that he held English, his country&#x27;s spiritual enemy, in the hollow of his hand, for the English language too came at his call to do his bidding. ... This language found itself constrained by its new master to perform tasks to which it was unaccustomed in the service of pure literature; against the grain it was forced to reproduce Joyce&#x27;s fantasies in all kinds of juxtapositions, neologisms, amalgamations, truncations, words that are only found scrawled up in public lavatories, obsolete words, words in limbo or belike in the womb of time.&quot;

In a 1946 essay, Irene Hendry identified four distinct epiphany techniques in Joyce&#x27;s work, noting their use in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, from the simplest device, such as the revelation of Gerty Macdowell&#x27;s limp, to the more complex, such as the bowl symbolism in &quot;Telemachus&quot;. Cited as an example of Joyce&#x27;s major epiphany technique—&quot;quidditas&quot; produced directly—is the revelation of Molly Bloom as &quot;female essence&quot;.

In his first book on Joyce, the American scholar William York Tindall wrote, &quot;Since the naturalists tried to establish reality, they were descriptive. Before perfecting his art, Joyce tried this method. The Dublin of &quot;Dubliners&quot; and its people are described. But almost abandoning description in &quot;Ulysses&quot; Joyce evoked place and people. He established his characters by what they say; and his places, named but not described, live in the minds of his characters. Yet no place is more solid than Joyce&#x27;s Dublin and no characters are more substantial. During his walk along the beach, Stephen exercises his descriptive powers on what he sees and hears. Gerty MacDowell&#x27;s scene, which concerns the eye, is suitably pictorial. The catalogue of externals in Mr. Bloom&#x27;s parlor is not naturalistic but a parody of naturalism and its reduction to absurdity. ... Joyce did not approach things directly like a naturalist but indirectly, through correspondence or analogy, as a symbolist.&quot;

In his second book on Joyce, Tindall wrote, &quot;It is certain that, careful of external details, Joyce observed his city as a naturalist would. ... Yet, in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, as in the earlier works, he used these particulars to suggest inner or general things—in the manner of Baudelaire and Flaubert. Such usage is symbolist; for a symbol is a common thing, closely observed, suggesting other things. An observer of things, Joyce saw something else within them and beyond, something they embodied and showed forth. That much is plain, let critics quarrel as they will. And it is plain that, however reliant upon details of Dublin, Joyce called again upon parallel and motif to enlarge his particulars and hold them together. ... The riddling motifs of &quot;Ulysses&quot; are complicated in turn by allusion, quotation, and single images or charged words—like those in &quot;A Portrait&quot; or, better, since &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a kind of poem, like those in &#x27;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&#x27;.&quot;

In his book-length study of &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1961), the Australian scholar S. L. Goldberg argued that interior monologue in &quot;Ulysses&quot; was rooted in Joyce&#x27;s epiphany technique. For Goldberg, the epiphany is &quot;the real artistic (and dramatic) unit of Joyce&#x27;s &#x27;stream-of-consciousness&#x27; writing. What he renders dramatically are minds engaged in the apprehension of epiphanies—the elements of meaning apprehended in life.&quot; 

In a 1965 interview, novelist Vladimir Nabokov called &quot;Ulysses&quot; &quot;a divine work of art [that] will live on despite the academic nonentities who turn it into a collection of symbols or Greek myths.&quot; He named it the greatest masterpiece of 20th-century prose. In a 1966 interview, he said, &quot;it towers above the rest of Joyce&#x27;s writing&quot; with &quot;noble originality and unique lucidity of thought and style&quot;. 

Psychology professor Charles Fernyhough called &quot;Ulysses&quot; &quot;the archetypal stream of consciousness novel&quot;.

Joyce uses &quot;metaphors, symbols, ambiguities, and overtones which gradually link themselves together so as to form a network of connections binding the whole&quot; work. This system of connections gives the novel a wide, more universal significance, as &quot;Leopold Bloom becomes a modern Ulysses, an Everyman in a Dublin which becomes a microcosm of the world.&quot; 

In 1998–99, &quot;Ulysses&quot; was ranked Number 1 in Modern Library&#x27;s 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.

==Publication history==

The publication history of &quot;Ulysses&quot; is complex. There have been at least 18 editions, and variations among different impressions of each edition.

According to Joyce scholar Jack Dalton, the first edition of &quot;Ulysses&quot; contained over 2,000 errors. As subsequent editions attempted to correct these mistakes, they would often add more, due in part to the difficulty of separating non-authorial errors from Joyce&#x27;s deliberate &quot;errors&quot; devised to challenge the reader.

Notable editions include:
* Paris: Shakespeare and Company, 1922: The private, first edition published in Paris on 2 February 1922 (Joyce&#x27;s 40th birthday) by Sylvia Beach&#x27;s Shakespeare and Company. Beach commissioned Darantiere in Dijon to print 1,000 numbered copies consisting of 100 signed copies on Dutch handmade paper (350 francs), 150 numbered copies on vergé d&#x27;Arches paper (250 francs), and 750 copies on handmade paper (150 francs), plus an extra 20 unnumbered copies on mixed paper for libraries and press.
* London: Egoist Press, 1922: The first English edition published by Harriet Shaw Weaver&#x27;s Egoist Press in October 1922. For legal reasons the book was printed on behalf of Egoist Press by John Rodker using the same printer, Darantiere, and plates as the first edition. This edition consisted of 2,000 numbered copies on handmade paper for sale plus 100 unnumbered copies for press, publicity and legal deposit libraries. A seven-page errata list compiled by Joyce, Weaver and Rodker was loosely inserted and contained 201 corrections. The U.S. Post Office reportedly burned up to 500 copies, as noted in later Shakespeare and Company editions.
* New York: Two Worlds Publishing Company, 1929: The first U.S. edition of the novel was pirated by Samuel Roth without Joyce&#x27;s authorisation, and first published serially in Roth&#x27;s &quot;Two Worlds Monthly&quot;, then later in a single volume in 1929. It was designed to closely mimic the 1927 Shakespeare and Company 9th printing but many errors and corruptions occurred during reproduction. Reportedly 2,000–3,000 copies were printed but the majority were seized and destroyed by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice after a raid on Roth&#x27;s offices on 4 October 1929 
* Hamburg: Odyssey Press, 1932: In two volumes. The title page of this edition states &quot;The present edition may be regarded as the definitive standard edition, as it has been specially revised, at the author&#x27;s request, by Stuart Gilbert.&quot; This edition still contained errors but by its fourth revised printing (April 1939) it was considered the most accurate offering of the text and subsequently used as the basis for many later editions of the novel.
* New York: Random House, 1934: The first authorised U.S. edition, published after the decision in &quot;United States v. One Book Called Ulysses&quot; finding that the book was not obscene. Random House&#x27;s founder Bennett Cerf chose to base this edition on a copy of the pirated Samuel Roth edition of 1929, which led it to reproduce many of that edition&#x27;s errors.
* London: Bodley Head, 1936: The first edition printed and published in England. Set from the second impression of Odyssey Press&#x27;s edition and purportedly proofed by Joyce.
* Bodley Head, 1960: Newly reset corrected edition based on the 1958 impression of the earlier Bodley Head edition. The source for many later editions by other publishers.
* Random House, 1961: Reset from the 1960 Bodley Head edition.
* &quot;Ulysses: A Critical and Synoptic Edition&quot;. Garland, 1984: Edited by Hans Walter Gabler.
* &quot;Ulysses: A Reader&#x27;s Edition&quot;. Lilliput Press, 1997: Edited by Danis Rose.

===&quot;Joyce Wars&quot;===
Hans Walter Gabler&#x27;s 1984 edition was the most sustained attempt to produce a corrected text, but it has received much criticism, most notably from John Kidd. Kidd&#x27;s main theoretical criticism is of Gabler&#x27;s choice of a patchwork of manuscripts as his copy-text (the base edition with which the editor compares each variant), but this fault stems from an assumption of the Anglo-American tradition of scholarly editing rather than the blend of French and German editorial theories that actually lay behind Gabler&#x27;s reasoning. The choice of a composite copy-text is seen to be problematic in the eyes of some American editors, who generally favour the first edition of any particular work as copy-text.

Less subject to differing national editorial theories, however, is the claim that for hundreds of pages—about half the episodes of &quot;Ulysses&quot;—the extant manuscript is purported to be a &quot;fair copy&quot; that Joyce made for sale to a potential patron. (As it turned out, John Quinn, the Irish-American lawyer and collector, purchased the manuscript.) Diluting this charge somewhat is the fact that the theory of (now lost) final working drafts is Gabler&#x27;s own. For the suspect episodes, the existing typescript is the last witness. Gabler attempted to reconstruct what he called &quot;the continuous manuscript text&quot;, which had never physically existed, by adding together all of Joyce&#x27;s accretions from the various sources. This allowed Gabler to produce a &quot;synoptic text&quot; indicating the stage at which each addition was inserted. Kidd and even some of Gabler&#x27;s own advisers believe this method meant losing Joyce&#x27;s final changes in about two thousand places. Far from being &quot;continuous&quot;, the manuscripts seem to be opposite. Jerome McGann describes in detail the editorial principles of Gabler in his article for the journal &quot;Criticism&quot;, issue 27, 1985. In the wake of the controversy, still other commentators charged that Gabler&#x27;s changes were motivated by a desire to secure a fresh copyright and another seventy-five years of royalties beyond a looming expiration date.

In June 1988 John Kidd published &quot;The Scandal of &quot;Ulysses&quot;&quot; in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, charging that not only did Gabler&#x27;s changes overturn Joyce&#x27;s last revisions, but in another four hundred places Gabler failed to follow any manuscript whatever, making nonsense of his own premises. Kidd accused Gabler of unnecessarily changing Joyce&#x27;s spelling, punctuation, use of accents, and all the small details he claimed to have been restoring. Instead, Gabler was actually following printed editions such as that of 1932, not the manuscripts. Gabler was found to have made genuine blunders, such as his changing the name of the real-life Dubliner Harry Thrift to &#x27;Shrift&#x27; and cricketer Captain Buller to &#x27;Culler&#x27; on the basis of handwriting irregularities in the extant manuscript. (These &quot;corrections&quot; were undone by Gabler in 1986.) Kidd stated that many of Gabler&#x27;s errors resulted from Gabler&#x27;s use of facsimiles rather than original manuscripts.

In December 1988, Charles Rossman&#x27;s &quot;The New &quot;Ulysses:&quot; The Hidden Controversy&quot; for &quot;The New York Review&quot; revealed that some of Gabler&#x27;s own advisers felt too many changes were being made, but that the publishers were pushing for as many alterations as possible. Then Kidd produced a 174-page critique that filled an entire issue of the &quot;Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America&quot;, dated the same month. This &quot;Inquiry into &quot;Ulysses&quot;: The Corrected Text&quot; was published the next year in book format and on floppy disk by Kidd&#x27;s James Joyce Research Center at Boston University.

Gabler and others, including Michael Groden, have rejected Kidd&#x27;s critique. In his 1993 afterword to the Gabler edition, Groden writes that Kidd&#x27;s lists of supposed errors were constructed &quot;with so little demonstrated understanding of Gabler&#x27;s theoretical assumptions and procedures ... that they can point to errors or misjudgments only by accident&quot;. The scholarly community remains divided. 
===Gabler edition replaced===

In 1990, Gabler&#x27;s American publisher Random House, after consulting a committee of scholars, replaced the Gabler edition with its 1961 version, and in the United Kingdom the Bodley Head press revived its 1960 version (upon which Random House&#x27;s 1961 version is based). In both the UK and US, Everyman&#x27;s Library also republished the 1960 &quot;Ulysses&quot;. In 1992, Penguin dropped Gabler and reprinted the 1960 text. The Gabler version remained available from Vintage International. Reprints of the 1922 first edition have also become widely available since 1 January 2012, when this edition entered the public domain under U.S. copyright law.

In 1992, W. W. Norton announced that it would publish Kidd&#x27;s much-anticipated edition of &quot;Ulysses&quot; as part of &quot;The Dublin Edition of the Works of James Joyce&quot; series. This book had to be withdrawn when the Joyce estate objected. For a period thereafter the estate refused to authorise any further editions of Joyce&#x27;s work. This ended when it agreed to allow Wordsworth Editions to bring out a bargain version of the novel (a reprint of the 1932 Odyssey Press edition) in January 2010, ahead of copyright expiration in 2012.

==Media adaptations==

===Theatre===
&quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot;, based on Episode 15 (&quot;Circe&quot;), premiered off-Broadway in 1958, with Zero Mostel as Bloom; it debuted on Broadway in 1974.

In 2006, playwright Sheila Callaghan&#x27;s &quot;Dead City&quot;, a contemporary stage adaptation of the book set in New York City, and featuring the male figures Bloom and Dedalus reimagined as female characters Samantha Blossom and Jewel Jupiter, was produced in Manhattan by New Georges.

In 2012, an adaption was staged in Glasgow, written by Dermot Bolger and directed by Andy Arnold. The production first premiered at the Tron Theatre, and later toured in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, made an appearance at the Edinburgh Festival, and was performed in China. In 2017 a revised version of Bolger&#x27;s adaption, directed and designed by Graham McLaren, premiered at Ireland&#x27;s national theatre, the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, as part of the 2017 Dublin Theatre Festival. It was revived in June 2018, and the script was published by Oberon Books.

In 2013, a new stage adaptation of the novel, &quot;Gibraltar&quot;, was produced in New York by the Irish Repertory Theatre. It was written by and starred Patrick Fitzgerald and directed by Terry Kinney. This two-person play focused on the love story of Bloom and Molly, played by Cara Seymour.

===Film===
In 1967, a film version of the book was directed by Joseph Strick. Starring Milo O&#x27;Shea as Bloom, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

In 2003, a movie version, &quot;Bloom&quot;, was released starring Stephen Rea and Angeline Ball.

===Television===
In 1988, the episode &quot;James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;&quot; of the documentary series &quot;The Modern World: Ten Great Writers&quot; was shown on Channel 4. Some of the novel&#x27;s scenes were dramatised. David Suchet played Leopold Bloom.

In September 2022, the episode &quot;James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;&quot; of the documentary series &quot;Arena&quot;, was shown on BBC.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc/m001bvp2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;irishnews/2022/ulysses-documentary&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lboro.ac.uk/bbc-ulysses&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.ie/arena-ulysses&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;themorgan.org/arena-ulysses&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio===
On Bloomsday 1982, RTÉ, Ireland&#x27;s national broadcaster, aired a full-cast, unabridged, dramatised radio production of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, that ran uninterrupted for 29 hours and 45 minutes.

The unabridged text of &quot;Ulysses&quot; has been performed by Jim Norton with Marcella Riordan. Naxos Records released the recording on 22 audio CDs in 2004. It follows an earlier abridged recording with the same actors. Both recordings were directed by the composer Roger Marsh, who has also produced an unabridged audiobook of &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

On Bloomsday 2010, author Frank Delaney launched a series of weekly podcasts called &quot;Re:Joyce&quot; that took listeners page by page through &quot;Ulysses&quot;, discussing its allusions, historical context and references. The podcast ran until Delaney&#x27;s death in 2017, at which point it was on the &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot; chapter.

BBC Radio 4 aired a new nine-part adaptation dramatised by Robin Brooks and produced/directed by Jeremy Mortimer, and starring Stephen Rea as the Narrator, Henry Goodman as Bloom, Niamh Cusack as Molly and Andrew Scott as Dedalus, for Bloomsday 2012, beginning on 16 June 2012.

Comedy/satire recording troupe The Firesign Theatre ends its 1969 album &quot;How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You&#x27;re Not Anywhere at All?&quot; with a male voice reciting the final lines of Molly Bloom&#x27;s soliloquy.

===Music===
&quot;Thema (Omaggio a Joyce)&quot; is an electroacoustic composition for voice and tape by Luciano Berio. Composed between 1958 and 1959, it is based on an interpretative reading of the novel&#x27;s &quot;Sirens&quot; chapter, as sung/voiced by his then wife Cathy Berberian. Umberto Eco, a lifelong admirer of Joyce, also contributed to its realisation. Berio&#x27;s &quot;Epifanie&quot; (1961/65) also includes texts from &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

Anthony Burgess composed the operetta &quot;Blooms of Dublin&quot; in 1982, as a very free interpretation of Joyce&#x27;s text. It was televised by the BBC, to mixed reviews.

The Radiators from Space released a song &quot;Kitty Ricketts&quot; on their album &quot;Ghostown&quot; (1979), in which the ghost of one of the prostitutes from Bella Cohen&#x27;s brothel haunts modern Dublin.

Kate Bush&#x27;s 1989 song &quot;Flower of the Mountain&quot; (originally the title track on &quot;The Sensual World&quot;) sets to music the end of Molly Bloom&#x27;s soliloquy.

The James Joyce Society in Dublin released the album &quot;Classical Ulysses&quot; for the Bloomsday100 celebrations in 2004. It contains recordings of the classical music mentioned in the book.

===Prose===
Jacob M. Appel&#x27;s novel &quot;The Biology of Luck&quot; (2013) is a retelling of &quot;Ulysses&quot; set in New York City. It features an inept tour guide, Larry Bloom, whose adventures parallel those of Leopold Bloom through Dublin.

<doc id="53932" wikidata="Q847073" url="?curid=53932" title="Euclidean distance">
<text>In mathematics, the Euclidean distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of the line segment between them. It can be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates of the points using the Pythagorean theorem, and therefore is occasionally called the Pythagorean distance.

These names come from the ancient Greek mathematicians Euclid and Pythagoras. In the Greek deductive geometry exemplified by Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, distances were not represented as numbers but line segments of the same length, which were considered &quot;equal&quot;. The notion of distance is inherent in the compass tool used to draw a circle, whose points all have the same distance from a common center point. The connection from the Pythagorean theorem to distance calculation was not made until the 18th century.

The distance between two objects that are not points is usually defined to be the smallest distance among pairs of points from the two objects. Formulas are known for computing distances between different types of objects, such as the distance from a point to a line. In advanced mathematics, the concept of distance has been generalized to abstract metric spaces, and other distances than Euclidean have been studied. In some applications in statistics and optimization, the square of the Euclidean distance is used instead of the distance itself.

== Distance formulas ==
=== One dimension ===
The distance between any two points on the real line is the absolute value of the numerical difference of their coordinates, their absolute difference. Thus if formula_1 and formula_2 are two points on the real line, then the distance between them is given by:

formula_3

A more complicated formula, giving the same value, but generalizing more readily to higher dimensions, is:

formula_4

In this formula, squaring and then taking the square root leaves any positive number unchanged, but replaces any negative number by its absolute value.

=== Two dimensions ===
In the Euclidean plane, let point formula_1 have Cartesian coordinates formula_6 and let point formula_2 have coordinates formula_8. Then the distance between formula_1 and formula_2 is given by:

formula_11

This can be seen by applying the Pythagorean theorem to a right triangle with horizontal and vertical sides, having the line segment from formula_1 to formula_2 as its hypotenuse. The two squared formulas inside the square root give the areas of squares on the horizontal and vertical sides, and the outer square root converts the area of the square on the hypotenuse into the length of the hypotenuse. In terms of the Pythagorean addition operation formula_14, available in many software libraries as codice_1, the same formula can be expressed as:

formula_15

It is also possible to compute the distance for points given by polar coordinates. If the polar coordinates of formula_1 are formula_17 and the polar coordinates of formula_2 are formula_19, then their distance is given by the law of cosines:

formula_20

When formula_1 and formula_2 are expressed as complex numbers in the complex plane, the same formula for one-dimensional points expressed as real numbers can be used, although here the absolute value sign indicates the complex norm:

formula_23

=== Higher dimensions ===
In three dimensions, for points given by their Cartesian coordinates, the distance is

formula_24

In general, for points given by Cartesian coordinates in formula_25-dimensional Euclidean space, the distance is

formula_26

The Euclidean distance may also be expressed more compactly in terms of the Euclidean norm of the Euclidean vector difference:

formula_27

=== Objects other than points ===
For pairs of objects that are not both points, the distance can most simply be defined as the smallest distance between any two points from the two objects, although more complicated generalizations from points to sets such as Hausdorff distance are also commonly used. Formulas for computing distances between different types of objects include:
*The distance from a point to a line, in the Euclidean plane
*The distance from a point to a plane in three-dimensional Euclidean space
*The distance between two lines in three-dimensional Euclidean space
The distance from a point to a curve can be used to define its parallel curve, another curve all of whose points have the same distance to the given curve.

== Properties ==
The Euclidean distance is the prototypical example of the distance in a metric space, and obeys all the defining properties of a metric space:
*It is &quot;symmetric&quot;, meaning that for all points formula_1 and formula_2, formula_30. That is (unlike road distance with one-way streets) the distance between two points does not depend on which of the two points is the start and which is the destination.
*It is &quot;positive&quot;, meaning that the distance between every two distinct points is a positive number, while the distance from any point to itself is zero.
*It obeys the triangle inequality: for every three points formula_1, formula_2, and formula_33, formula_34. Intuitively, traveling from formula_1 to formula_33 via formula_2 cannot be any shorter than traveling directly from formula_1 to formula_33.

Another property, Ptolemy&#x27;s inequality, concerns the Euclidean distances among four points formula_1, formula_2, formula_33, and formula_43. It states that

formula_44

For points in the plane, this can be rephrased as stating that for every quadrilateral, the products of opposite sides of the quadrilateral sum to at least as large a number as the product of its diagonals. However, Ptolemy&#x27;s inequality applies more generally to points in Euclidean spaces of any dimension, no matter how they are arranged. For points in metric spaces that are not Euclidean spaces, this inequality may not be true. Euclidean distance geometry studies properties of Euclidean distance such as Ptolemy&#x27;s inequality, and their application in testing whether given sets of distances come from points in a Euclidean space.

According to the Beckman–Quarles theorem, any transformation of the Euclidean plane or of a higher-dimensional Euclidean space that preserves unit distances must be an isometry, preserving all distances.

== Squared Euclidean distance ==
In many applications, and in particular when comparing distances, it may be more convenient to omit the final square root in the calculation of Euclidean distances, as the square root does not change the order (formula_45 if and only if formula_46). The value resulting from this omission is the square of the Euclidean distance, and is called the squared Euclidean distance. For instance, the Euclidean minimum spanning tree can be determined using only the ordering between distances, and not their numeric values. Comparing squared distances produces the same result but avoids an unnecessary square-root calculation and sidesteps issues of numerical precision. As an equation, the squared distance can be expressed as a sum of squares:

formula_47

Beyond its application to distance comparison, squared Euclidean distance is of central importance in statistics, where it is used in the method of least squares, a standard method of fitting statistical estimates to data by minimizing the average of the squared distances between observed and estimated values, and as the simplest form of divergence to compare probability distributions. The addition of squared distances to each other, as is done in least squares fitting, corresponds to an operation on (unsquared) distances called Pythagorean addition. In cluster analysis, squared distances can be used to strengthen the effect of longer distances.

Squared Euclidean distance does not form a metric space, as it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. However it is a smooth, strictly convex function of the two points, unlike the distance, which is non-smooth (near pairs of equal points) and convex but not strictly convex. The squared distance is thus preferred in optimization theory, since it allows convex analysis to be used. Since squaring is a monotonic function of non-negative values, minimizing squared distance is equivalent to minimizing the Euclidean distance, so the optimization problem is equivalent in terms of either, but easier to solve using squared distance.

The collection of all squared distances between pairs of points from a finite set may be stored in a Euclidean distance matrix, and is used in this form in distance geometry.

== Generalizations ==
In more advanced areas of mathematics, when viewing Euclidean space as a vector space, its distance is associated with a norm called the Euclidean norm, defined as the distance of each vector from the origin. One of the important properties of this norm, relative to other norms, is that it remains unchanged under arbitrary rotations of space around the origin. By Dvoretzky&#x27;s theorem, every finite-dimensional normed vector space has a high-dimensional subspace on which the norm is approximately Euclidean; the Euclidean norm is the
only norm with this property. It can be extended to infinite-dimensional vector spaces as the norm or distance. The Euclidean distance gives Euclidean space the structure of a topological space, the Euclidean topology, with the open balls (subsets of points at less than a given distance from a given point) as its neighborhoods.
Other common distances in real coordinate spaces and function spaces:
*Chebyshev distance ( distance), which measures distance as the maximum of the distances in each coordinate.
*Taxicab distance ( distance), also called Manhattan distance, which measures distance as the sum of the distances in each coordinate.
*Minkowski distance ( distance), a generalization that unifies Euclidean distance, taxicab distance, and Chebyshev distance.

For points on surfaces in three dimensions, the Euclidean distance should be distinguished from the geodesic distance, the length of a shortest curve that belongs to the surface. In particular, for measuring great-circle distances on the Earth or other spherical or near-spherical surfaces, distances that have been used include the haversine distance giving great-circle distances between two points on a sphere from their longitudes and latitudes, and Vincenty&#x27;s formulae also known as &quot;Vincent distance&quot; for distance on a spheroid.

== History ==
Euclidean distance is the distance in Euclidean space. Both concepts are named after ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, whose &quot;Elements&quot; became a standard textbook in geometry for many centuries. Concepts of length and distance are widespread across cultures, can be dated to the earliest surviving &quot;protoliterate&quot; bureaucratic documents from Sumer in the fourth millennium BC (far before Euclid), and have been hypothesized to develop in children earlier than the related concepts of speed and time. But the notion of a distance, as a number defined from two points, does not actually appear in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;. Instead, Euclid approaches this concept implicitly, through the congruence of line segments, through the comparison of lengths of line segments, and through the concept of proportionality.

The Pythagorean theorem is also ancient, but it could only take its central role in the measurement of distances after the invention of Cartesian coordinates by René Descartes in 1637. The distance formula itself was first published in 1731 by Alexis Clairaut. Because of this formula, Euclidean distance is also sometimes called Pythagorean distance. Although accurate measurements of long distances on the Earth&#x27;s surface, which are not Euclidean, had again been studied in many cultures since ancient times (see history of geodesy), the idea that Euclidean distance might not be the only way of measuring distances between points in mathematical spaces came even later, with the 19th-century formulation of non-Euclidean geometry. The definition of the Euclidean norm and Euclidean distance for geometries of more than three dimensions also first appeared in the 19th century, in the work of Augustin-Louis Cauchy.

<doc id="53933" wikidata="Q211569" url="?curid=53933" title="Permittivity">
<text>In electromagnetism, the absolute permittivity, often simply called permittivity and denoted by the Greek letter (epsilon), is a measure of the electric polarizability of a dielectric material. A material with high permittivity polarizes more in response to an applied electric field than a material with low permittivity, thereby storing more energy in the material. In electrostatics, the permittivity plays an important role in determining the capacitance of a capacitor.

In the simplest case, the electric displacement field resulting from an applied electric field E is

formula_1

More generally, the permittivity is a thermodynamic function of state. It can depend on the frequency, magnitude, and direction of the applied field. The SI unit for permittivity is farad per meter (F/m).

The permittivity is often represented by the relative permittivity which is the ratio of the absolute permittivity and the vacuum permittivity 

formula_2

This dimensionless quantity is also often and ambiguously referred to as the &quot;permittivity&quot;. Another common term encountered for both absolute and relative permittivity is the &quot;dielectric constant&quot; which has been deprecated in physics and engineering as well as in chemistry.

By definition, a perfect vacuum has a relative permittivity of exactly 1 whereas at standard temperature and pressure, air has a relative permittivity of 

Relative permittivity is directly related to electric susceptibility () by

formula_3

otherwise written as

formula_4

The term &quot;permittivity&quot; was introduced in the 1880s by Oliver Heaviside to complement Thomson&#x27;s (1872) &quot;permeability&quot;. Formerly written as , the designation with has been in common use since the 1950s.

== Units ==
The SI unit of permittivity is farad per meter (F/m or F·m−1).

formula_5

== Explanation ==
In electromagnetism, the electric displacement field represents the distribution of electric charges in a given medium resulting from the presence of an electric field . This distribution includes charge migration and electric dipole reorientation. Its relation to permittivity in the very simple case of &quot;linear, homogeneous, isotropic&quot; materials with &quot;&quot;instantaneous&quot; response&quot; to changes in electric field is:

formula_6

where the permittivity is a scalar. If the medium is anisotropic, the permittivity is a second rank tensor.

In general, permittivity is not a constant, as it can vary with the position in the medium, the frequency of the field applied, humidity, temperature, and other parameters. In a nonlinear medium, the permittivity can depend on the strength of the electric field. Permittivity as a function of frequency can take on real or complex values.

In SI units, permittivity is measured in farads per meter (F/m or A2·s4·kg−1·m−3). The displacement field is measured in units of coulombs per square meter (C/m2), while the electric field is measured in volts per meter (V/m). and describe the interaction between charged objects. is related to the &quot;charge densities&quot; associated with this interaction, while is related to the &quot;forces&quot; and &quot;potential differences&quot;.

== Vacuum permittivity ==
The vacuum permittivity (also called permittivity of free space or the electric constant) is the ratio in free space. It also appears in the Coulomb force constant,

formula_7

Its value is

formula_8

where
* is the speed of light in free space,
* is the vacuum permeability.

The constants and were both defined in SI units to have exact numerical values until the 2019 revision of the SI. Therefore, until that date, could be also stated exactly as a fraction, formula_9
even if the result was irrational (because the fraction contained ). In contrast, the ampere was a measured quantity before 2019, but since then the ampere is now exactly defined and it is that is an experimentally measured quantity (with consequent uncertainty) and therefore so is the new 2019 definition of ( remains exactly defined before and since 2019).

== Relative permittivity ==
The linear permittivity of a homogeneous material is usually given relative to that of free space, as a relative permittivity (also called dielectric constant, although this term is deprecated and sometimes only refers to the static, zero-frequency relative permittivity). In an anisotropic material, the relative permittivity may be a tensor, causing birefringence. The actual permittivity is then calculated by multiplying the relative permittivity by :

formula_10

where (frequently written ) is the electric susceptibility of the material.

The susceptibility is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a tensor) relating an electric field to the induced dielectric polarization density such that

formula_11

where is the electric permittivity of free space.

The susceptibility of a medium is related to its relative permittivity by

formula_12

So in the case of a vacuum,

formula_13

The susceptibility is also related to the polarizability of individual particles in the medium by the Clausius-Mossotti relation.

The electric displacement is related to the polarization density by

formula_14

The permittivity and permeability of a medium together determine the phase velocity of electromagnetic radiation through that medium:

formula_15

== Practical applications ==

=== Determining capacitance ===
The capacitance of a capacitor is based on its design and architecture, meaning it will not change with charging and discharging. The formula for capacitance in a parallel plate capacitor is written as

formula_16

where formula_17 is the area of one plate, formula_18 is the distance between the plates, and formula_19 is the permittivity of the medium between the two plates. For a capacitor with relative permittivity formula_20, it can be said that

formula_21

=== Gauss&#x27;s law ===
Permittivity is connected to electric flux (and by extension electric field) through Gauss&#x27;s law. Gauss&#x27;s law states that for a closed Gaussian surface, ,

formula_22
where formula_23 is the net electric flux passing through the surface, formula_24 is the charge enclosed in the Gaussian surface, formula_25 is the electric field vector at a given point on the surface, and formula_26 is a differential area vector on the Gaussian surface.

If the Gaussian surface uniformly encloses an insulated, symmetrical charge arrangement, the formula can be simplified to

formula_27
where formula_28 represents the angle between the electric field lines and the normal (perpendicular) to .

If all of the electric field lines cross the surface at 90°, the formula can be further simplified to

formula_29

Because the surface area of a sphere is formula_30 the electric field a distance formula_31 away from a uniform, spherical charge arrangement is

formula_32

This formula applies to the electric field due to a point charge, outside of a conducting sphere or shell, outside of a uniformly charged insulating sphere, or between the plates of a spherical capacitor.

== Dispersion and causality ==
In general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field, and so the more general formulation as a function of time is

formula_33

That is, the polarization is a convolution of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by . The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines for . An instantaneous response would correspond to a Dirac delta function susceptibility .

It is convenient to take the Fourier transform with respect to time and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Because of the convolution theorem, the integral becomes a simple product,

formula_34

This frequency dependence of the susceptibility leads to frequency dependence of the permittivity. The shape of the susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the dispersion properties of the material.

Moreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e. effectively for ), a consequence of causality, imposes Kramers–Kronig constraints on the susceptibility .

=== Complex permittivity ===
As opposed to the response of a vacuum, the response of normal materials to external fields generally depends on the frequency of the field. This frequency dependence reflects the fact that a material&#x27;s polarization does not change instantaneously when an electric field is applied. The response must always be &quot;causal&quot; (arising after the applied field), which can be represented by a phase difference. For this reason, permittivity is often treated as a complex function of the (angular) frequency of the applied field:

formula_35

(since complex numbers allow specification of magnitude and phase). The definition of permittivity therefore becomes

formula_36
where

* and are the amplitudes of the displacement and electric fields, respectively,
* is the imaginary unit, .

The response of a medium to static electric fields is described by the low-frequency limit of permittivity, also called the static permittivity (also ):

formula_37

At the high-frequency limit (meaning optical frequencies), the complex permittivity is commonly referred to as (or sometimes ). At the plasma frequency and below, dielectrics behave as ideal metals, with electron gas behavior. The static permittivity is a good approximation for alternating fields of low frequencies, and as the frequency increases a measurable phase difference emerges between and . The frequency at which the phase shift becomes noticeable depends on temperature and the details of the medium. For moderate field strength (), and remain proportional, and

formula_38

Since the response of materials to alternating fields is characterized by a complex permittivity, it is natural to separate its real and imaginary parts, which is done by convention in the following way:

formula_39

where
* is the real part of the permittivity;
* is the imaginary part of the permittivity;
* is the loss angle.

The choice of sign for time-dependence, , dictates the sign convention for the imaginary part of permittivity. The signs used here correspond to those commonly used in physics, whereas for the engineering convention one should reverse all imaginary quantities.

The complex permittivity is usually a complicated function of frequency , since it is a superimposed description of dispersion phenomena occurring at multiple frequencies. The dielectric function must have poles only for frequencies with positive imaginary parts, and therefore satisfies the Kramers–Kronig relations. However, in the narrow frequency ranges that are often studied in practice, the permittivity can be approximated as frequency-independent or by model functions.

At a given frequency, the imaginary part, , leads to absorption loss if it is positive (in the above sign convention) and gain if it is negative. More generally, the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the anisotropic dielectric tensor should be considered.

In the case of solids, the complex dielectric function is intimately connected to band structure. The primary quantity that characterizes the electronic structure of any crystalline material is the probability of photon absorption, which is directly related to the imaginary part of the optical dielectric function . The optical dielectric function is given by the fundamental expression:

formula_40

In this expression, represents the product of the Brillouin zone-averaged transition probability at the energy with the joint density of states,
; is a broadening function, representing the role of scattering in smearing out the energy levels.
In general, the broadening is intermediate between Lorentzian and Gaussian;
for an alloy it is somewhat closer to Gaussian because of strong scattering from statistical fluctuations in the local composition on a nanometer scale.

=== Tensorial permittivity ===

According to the Drude model of magnetized plasma, a more general expression which takes into account the interaction of the carriers with an alternating electric field at millimeter and microwave frequencies in an axially magnetized semiconductor requires the expression of the permittivity as a non-diagonal tensor:

formula_41

If vanishes, then the tensor is diagonal but not proportional to the identity and the medium is said to be a uniaxial medium, which has similar properties to a uniaxial crystal.

=== Classification of materials ===

Materials can be classified according to their complex-valued permittivity , upon comparison of its real and imaginary components (or, equivalently, conductivity, , when accounted for in the latter). A &quot;perfect conductor&quot; has infinite conductivity, , while a &quot;perfect dielectric&quot; is a material that has no conductivity at all, ; this latter case, of real-valued permittivity (or complex-valued permittivity with zero imaginary component) is also associated with the name &quot;lossless media&quot;. Generally, when formula_42 we consider the material to be a &quot;low-loss dielectric&quot; (although not exactly lossless), whereas formula_43 is associated with a &quot;good conductor&quot;; such materials with non-negligible conductivity yield a large amount of loss that inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves, thus are also said to be &quot;lossy media&quot;. Those materials that do not fall under either limit are considered to be general media.

=== Lossy media ===
In the case of a lossy medium, i.e. when the conduction current is not negligible, the total current density flowing is:

formula_44

where
* is the conductivity of the medium;
* formula_45 is the real part of the permittivity.
* formula_46 is the complex permittivity

Note that this is using the electrical engineering convention of the complex conjugate ambiguity; the physics/chemistry convention involves the complex conjugate of these equations.

The size of the displacement current is dependent on the frequency of the applied field ; there is no displacement current in a constant field.

In this formalism, the complex permittivity is defined as:

formula_47

In general, the absorption of electromagnetic energy by dielectrics is covered by a few different mechanisms that influence the shape of the permittivity as a function of frequency:

* First are the relaxation effects associated with permanent and induced molecular dipoles. At low frequencies the field changes slowly enough to allow dipoles to reach before the field has measurably changed. For frequencies at which dipole orientations cannot follow the applied field because of the viscosity of the medium, absorption of the field&#x27;s energy leads to energy dissipation. The mechanism of dipoles relaxing is called dielectric relaxation and for ideal dipoles is described by classic Debye relaxation.
* Second are the resonance effects, which arise from the rotations or vibrations of atoms, ions, or electrons. These processes are observed in the neighborhood of their characteristic absorption frequencies.

The above effects often combine to cause non-linear effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption refers to the inability of a capacitor that has been charged for a long time to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called &quot;soakage&quot; or &quot;battery action&quot;. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1–2% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15–25% in the case of electrolytic capacitors or supercapacitors.

=== Quantum-mechanical interpretation ===
In terms of quantum mechanics, permittivity is explained by atomic and molecular interactions.

At low frequencies, molecules in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the microwave frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break hydrogen bonds. The field does work against the bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as heat. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens.

At moderate frequencies, the energy is too high to cause rotation, yet too low to affect electrons directly, and is absorbed in the form of resonant molecular vibrations. In water, this is where the absorptive index starts to drop sharply, and the minimum of the imaginary permittivity is at the frequency of blue light (optical regime).

At high frequencies (such as UV and above), molecules cannot relax, and the energy is purely absorbed by atoms, exciting electron energy levels. Thus, these frequencies are classified as ionizing radiation.

While carrying out a complete &quot;ab initio&quot; (that is, first-principles) modelling is now computationally possible, it has not been widely applied yet. Thus, a phenomenological model is accepted as being an adequate method of capturing experimental behaviors. The Debye model and the Lorentz model use a first-order and second-order (respectively) lumped system parameter linear representation (such as an RC and an LRC resonant circuit).

== Measurement ==
The relative permittivity of a material can be found by a variety of static electrical measurements. The complex permittivity is evaluated over a wide range of frequencies by using different variants of dielectric spectroscopy, covering nearly 21 orders of magnitude from 10−6 to 1015 hertz. Also, by using cryostats and ovens, the dielectric properties of a medium can be characterized over an array of temperatures. In order to study systems for such diverse excitation fields, a number of measurement setups are used, each adequate for a special frequency range.

Various microwave measurement techniques are outlined in Chen &quot;et al.&quot; Typical errors for the Hakki–Coleman method employing a puck of material between conducting planes are about 0.3%.
* Low-frequency time domain measurements ( to  Hz)
* Low-frequency frequency domain measurements ( to  Hz)
* Reflective coaxial methods ( to  Hz)
* Transmission coaxial method ( to  Hz)
* Quasi-optical methods ( to  Hz)
* Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy ( to  Hz)
* Fourier-transform methods ( to  Hz)

At infrared and optical frequencies, a common technique is ellipsometry. Dual polarisation interferometry is also used to measure the complex refractive index for very thin films at optical frequencies.

For the 3D measurement of dielectric tensors at optical frequency, Dielectric tensor tomography can be used.

<text>A real data type is a data type used in a computer program to represent an approximation of a real number. Because the real numbers are not countable, computers cannot represent them exactly using a finite amount of information. Most often, a computer will use a rational approximation to a real number.

==Rational numbers==
The most general data type for a rational number (a number that can be expressed as a fraction) stores the numerator and the denominator as integers. For example 1/3, which can be calculated to any desired precision. Rational number are used, for example, in Interpress from Xerox Corporation.

==Fixed-point numbers==
A fixed-point data type uses the same, implied, denominator for all numbers. The denominator is usually a power of two. For example, in a hypothetical fixed-point system that uses the denominator 65,536 (216), the hexadecimal number 0x12345678 (0x1234.5678 with sixteen fractional bits to the right of the assumed radix point) means 0x12345678/65536 or 305419896/65536, 4660 + the fractional value 22136/65536, or about 4660.33777. An integer is a fixed-point number with a fractional part of zero.

==Floating-point numbers==
A floating-point data type is a compromise between the flexibility of a general rational number data type and the speed of fixed-point arithmetic. It uses some of the bits in the data type to specify an exponent for the denominator, today usually power of two although both ten and sixteen have been used.

==Decimal numbers==
The decimal type is similar to fixed-point or floating-point data type, but with a denominator that is a power of 10 instead of a power of 2.

<text>The history of the Czech lands – an area roughly corresponding to the present-day Czech Republic – starts approximately 800 years BCE. A simple chopper from that age was discovered at the Red Hill () archeological site in Brno. Many different primitive cultures left their traces throughout the Stone Age, which lasted approximately until 2000 BCE. The most widely known culture present in the Czech lands during the pre-historical era is the Únětice Culture, leaving traces for about five centuries from the end of the Stone Age to the start of the Bronze Age. Celts – who came during the 5th century BCE – are the first people known by name. One of the Celtic tribes were the Boii (plural), who gave the Czech lands their first name &quot;Boiohaemum&quot; – Latin for &quot;the Land of Boii&quot;. Before the beginning of the Common Era the Celts were mostly pushed out by Germanic tribes. The most notable of those tribes were the Marcomanni and traces of their wars with the Roman Empire were left in south Moravia.

After the turbulent times of the Migration Period, the Czech lands were ultimately settled by the Slavic tribes. The year of 623 marks the formation of the first known state in the Czech lands, when Samo united the local Slavic tribes, defended their lands from the Avars to the east and – few years later – won the battle of Wogastisburg against the Franks invading the Czech lands from the west. The next state appearing in the Czech lands after the dissolution of the Samo&#x27;s state was probably the Great Moravia. The center of its power lay in the area of Moravia and present-day western Slovakia. In 863, Cyril and Methodius, two scholars from Greece, brought Christianity to the Great Moravia and established the first Slavic script – Glagolitsa. The Great Moravia fell during the Magyar invasion at the start of the 10th century.

A new state formed around the tribe of Premyslids, who founded the Duchy of Bohemia. The duchy existed largely within the sphere of influence of the East Franconia and later the Holy Roman Empire. The duchy sided with the Roman Catholic Church during the East-West Schism and in 1212, the duke Ottokar I was granted the hereditary title of king for his service to the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. The Přemyslid dynasty died out at the start of the 14th century and was replaced by the Luxembourg dynasty. The most notable of the Luxembourg rulers was Charles IV, who was elected the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He established the Archbishopric of Prague and Charles University, the first university north of the Alps and east of Paris. The start of the 15th century saw the rise of Proto-Protestantic sentiments in the Czech lands. The execution of Jan Hus sparked the Hussite Wars and the religious split that followed them. The Jagiellon dynasty ascended the Czech throne in 1471. They ruled for half a century before the king Louis Jagiellon died in the Battle of Mohács and the empty throne was given to the House of Habsburg.

After the death of the Emperor Rudolf II of Habsburg, the religious and political tensions grew, resulting in the Second Defenestration of Prague, which sparked the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Many of the Czech nobles supported the Protestant side and were stripped of their properties as a result. Germanization and recatholicisation of the Czech lands followed. The spread of Romanticism during the late 18th century went hand in hand with the movement of the Czech National Revival. After 1848, the leading representatives of the Czech National Revival increased their political efforts to gain more autonomy for the Czech lands within the Habsburg Monarchy.

The start of World War I opened the possibility of gaining full independence and formation of a sovereign state. In the Cleveland Agreement of 1915, the Czech and Slovak representatives declared their goal of creating a common state, based on the right of a people to self-determination. After the capitulation of Austria-Hungary three years later, the Czechoslovak Republic became a reality. The so-called First Republic lasted for 20 years, cut short by the advent of the World War II. Following the end of World War II, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took power in 1948, and Czechoslovakia became a member of the Eastern Bloc. In August 1968, armies of the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia to prevent further attempts at the reformation of the Communist system. In November 1989, the Velvet Revolution replaced the Communist regime with a democratic Czech and Slovak Federative Republic. Three years later, Czech and Slovak representatives agreed to the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia and the formation of separate states. In 1999, the Czech Republic joined Nato and in 2004, became a member of the European Union.

==Ancient times==

=== Stone Age ===

A simple chopper – left by the ancestors of the present-day Homo Sapiens – dated to 800,000 BCE was uncovered in Red Hill in Brno. First evidence of human camps was found in Přezletice near Prague and in Stránská skála near Brno which dates to about 200,000 years after that. 
Stone tools were found in the Kůlna Cave in central Moravia, with the estimated age of 120,000 years. More stone tools and the skeletal remains of a Neanderthal man were found at the same site in a 50,000-year-old layer.

Human remains from 45,000 years ago were found in Koněprusy Caves in Zlatý kůň at Beroun District. Human remains from 30,000 years BCE were found in Mladeč caves mammoth tusks with complex engravings (again around 30,000 BCE) were found both in Pavlov and Předmostí at Přerov, making south Moravia one of the most important archeological areas in Europe.

The archeological site in Předmostí at Přerov represents the largest accumulation of human remains of the Gravettian culture, 
known for creating so-called Venus figurines. One of such figurines is the famous Venus of Dolní Věstonice (29,000–25,000 BCE) found in Dolní Věstonice in south Moravia along with many other artifacts from that time. Another Venus figurine is the Venus of Petřkovice, found in what is today Ostrava. Remains of mammoth hunters from 22,000 BCE were also found in the aforementioned Kůlna Cave along with the remains of reindeer hunters and horse hunters, dated to about 10,000 years later. Approximately between 5500 and 4500 BCE, people of the Linear Pottery culture resided in Czech lands. Their settlement was discovered in Bylany near Kutná hora. Their culture was succeeded by the Lengyel culture, Funnelbeaker culture and Stroke-ornamented ware culture, which coexisted in the Czech Lands during the end of the Stone Age.

===Copper Age and Bronze Age===
Corded Ware culture in the north and Baden culture in the south were the predominant cultures in the Czech Lands throughout the Copper Age. The Bell Beaker culture represented the transition from the Copper Age to the Bronze Age. With the start of the Bronze Age, Únětice culture appeared. This culture got its name from a village near Prague, where the first discovery was made in the 1870s. Many of their burial mounds were uncovered, mostly in central Bohemia. It was followed by the Middle Bronze Age Tumulus culture from around 1600 BC. The Urnfield culture is blanket term for various Late Bronze Age cultures dating from c. 1300-800 BC who cremated their dead and buried the urns with their ashes. The Hallstatt culture was the last culture of the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. The key archeological site of the Hallstatt culture in the Czech Lands is the Býčí skála Cave, where a rare bronze statue of a bull was found. Many of these archeological sites were occupied by multiple cultures throughout the ancient times.

===Iron Age===
The area was settled by the Celtic tribes at the start of the Iron Age. The most prominent tribe in Bohemia were the Boii (plural), who gave the area the name of &quot;Boiohaemia&quot; (Latin for &quot;the land of Boii&quot;), which later turned into Bohemia. Before the start of the 1st century CE, they were pushed out by various Germanic tribes (Marcomanni, Quadi, Lombards). Around 60 to 50 BC, the Dacian king Burebista established an empire that extended its reach into the lands of the Boii. The Dacian occupation primarily affected modern-day Slovakia but also held sway over regions of present-day Czech Republic and Pannonia. Following Burebista&#x27;s demise in 44 BC, his empire crumbled, liberating the lands of the Boii from Dacian rule. Traces of Roman army camps were found in south Moravia, most notably near Mušov. The winter camp in Mušov was built to house approximately 20,000 soldiers. The Romans were repeatedly at war with the Marcomanni tribe during the first two centuries CE. Germanic towns are described on the Map of Ptolemaios from the 2nd century, e.g. Coridorgis for Jihlava.

===Arrival of the Slavs===
The following centuries of what is known as the Great Migration once again changed the ethnic composition of the Czech Lands. In the 6th century, Slavic tribes, displaced by Langobard and Thuringian tribes began to move into the Czech Lands from the east. They fought with neighboring Avars – Turko-Tartar nomads – who seized the Pannonia and frequently raided the Slavic lands and even the Frankish Empire.

===Samo&#x27;s realm===

In 623 – according to the Chronicle of Fredegar – the Slavic tribes revolted against the oppression of the Avars. During this time, the Frankish merchant Samo allegedly came to the Czech lands with his entourage and joined with the Slavs to defeat the Avars. Thus the Slavs adopted Samo as their ruler. Later Samo and the Slavs came into conflict with the Frankish empire whose ruler Dagobert I wanted to extend his rule to the east. That led to the Battle of Wogastisburg in 631, in which the newly established Realm of Samo successfully defended its autonomy. The realm disintegrated after Samo&#x27;s death.

==Medieval times==

===Great Moravia===
The realm of Great Moravia probably was established in the area of today&#x27;s Moravia and western Slovakia in the 830s. It saw the rise of the first ever Slavic literary culture in the Old Church Slavonic language and the creation of the Glagolitic alphabet, the first alphabet dedicated to a Slavic language. Glagolitic was later simplified into the Cyrillic alphabet that is today used in Russia and many countries in eastern Europe and central Asia. Glagolitic was created by St. Cyril and St. Methodius, who arrived in Great Moravia in 863 from Thessaloniki in Byzantine Empire. They were invited by the king Rastislav who invited them to introduce literacy and a legal system to Great Moravia. His nephew and successor Svatopluk I&#x27;s diplomacy was oriented more towards Rome. Great Moravia was taken under the protection of the Holy See in 880 and six years after, he expelled the disciples of Methodius after their teacher&#x27;s death. During his reign, Great Moravia&#x27;s sphere of influence reached its peak. After his death, the realm was split among his sons and soon after fell to ruin due to infighting and constant Magyar raids during the start of the 10th century.

=== Duchy of Bohemia ===

Bořivoj from Levý Hradec was the first known member of the Přemyslid dynasty. In 880, he moved his residence to Prague Castle, which laid the foundation of the city of Prague that emerged centuries later. He was a vassal to the kings of Great Moravia and was baptised during the christanisation of Great Moravia by St. Cyril and St. Methodius. His son Spytihněv I together with the head of another major Bohemian tribe Witizla used the collapse of Great Moravia and in 895 swore allegiance to the East Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia. Spytihněv&#x27;s nephew Wenceslaus (later proclaimed a saint by the Catholic Church) ruled from 921 and had to submit to the Saxon king Henry I in order to maintain his ducal authority. He was murdered by his younger brother Boleslaus I. Boleslaus I expanded the Duchy of Bohemia eastwards conquering the lands of Moravia and Silesia and areas around Kraków. He stopped paying tribute to the Saxon king igniting a war which he lost and was forced to recognize Saxon suzerainty over the Duchy of Bohemia. The Bishopric of Prague was founded in 973 during the reign of his son Boleslaus II. The bishopric was subordinated to the Archbishopric of Mainz.

In 1002, during the reign of the duke Vladivoj, the Duchy of Bohemia formally became a part of the Holy Roman Empire. After a period of dynastic infighting, Oldřich took power. His son Břetislav I led many ambitious conquests and later revolted against the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III hoping to gain a full autonomy for the Duchy of Bohemia. Despite the initial success in Battle at Brůdek, he could not withstand the second invasion of the imperial army and ultimately had to renounce all of his conquests save for Moravia and recognize Henry III as his sovereign. After Břetislav&#x27;s death, the infighting among Přemyslids continued – a consequence of seniority inheritance laws. Among the more notable rulers belong (Vratislaus II and Vladislaus) who were awarded lifetime titles of kings by the Holy Roman Emperors for their services.

===Kingdom of Bohemia===

====Late Přemyslids====
In 1212 Ottokar I was granted a hereditary title of the King of Bohemia by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Thus began the Kingdom of Bohemia, which lasted de iure until the end of World War I. His reign marked the start of the German eastward colonization, which over time significantly altered the language composition of the Czech Lands. His son Wenceslaus I had to deal with the Mongol invasion of Europe at the start of 1240s. He managed to defend Bohemia, but Moravian lands were heavily plundered. When the Duke of Austria Frederick II died in 1246 without male heirs, Wenceslaus I tried to secure the Austrian lands by marrying his eldest son Vladislaus to Frederick&#x27;s niece Gertrude. This plan failed because of Vladislaus&#x27;s premature death in the year after. Wenceslaus I then decided for the invasion of Austria and he was successful. His successor, Ottokar II, continued the expansion of the realm. He gained more territory south of Austria and led two crusades against the pagan Old Prussians. He was hoping to gain the Imperial crown, but lost in the 1273 election to Rudolf of Habsburg, the first in a line of Habsburg emperors. Rudolf of Habsburg demanded that Ottokar II returns all of the lands he had acquired south of Bohemia. Ottokar refused and waged two wars against the emperor which ended with his death at the battlefield of Marchfeld in 1278.

The crown was passed to his 6-year-old son Wenceslaus II. Otto V, Margrave of Brandenburg ruled as a regent in his stead, later replaced by Záviš of Falkenstein, who married Ottokar II&#x27;s widow. In 1290, Wenceslaus II had Záviš beheaded for alleged treason and began ruling independently. Year later, Przemysł II, the king of Poland, was murdered and Wenceslaus II gained the Polish crown for himself. At the end of the 13th century, huge deposits of silver were found in Kutná Hora, which allowed him to start issuing vast amounts of silver coins called Prague groschen. In 1301, another neighbouring monarch died – Andrew III of Hungary, the last male member of the Árpád dynasty. Wenceslaus II married his son Wenceslaus III to Andrew III&#x27;s only daughter and had him crowned in Székesfehérvár as the King of Hungary. Four years later, Wenceslaus II died – only 33 years old – probably of tuberculosis. Wenceslaus III abandoned his claim to the Hungarian throne, seeing that his rule was only nominal. Władysław the Elbow-high challenged Wenceslaus III&#x27;s rule in Poland and conquered Krakow in 1306. Before Wenceslaus III could start his retaliation campaign, he was murdered in Olomouc by unknown assassins.

====House of Luxembourg====
Wenceslaus III was the last male member of the main branch of Přemyslids. The Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII of the House of Luxembourg married his son John to Wenceslaus III&#x27;s sister Elisabeth and secured for him the Bohemian throne. John of Luxembourg was raised in Paris, did not speak any Czech and was widely unpopular among the Czech nobility. John never stayed long in the Czech lands, he traveled all across Europe and took part in multiple military conflicts. While crusading in Lithuania in 1336, John lost his eyesight due to ophthalmia, which earned him the nickname John the Blind. A year later he took the side of King Philip VI of France in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and died in 1346 in the Battle of Crécy. His eldest son, Charles IV succeeded him on the Bohemian throne.
Earlier in 1346, the Pope Clement VI declared the Emperor Louis IV a heretic and demanded a new Imperial election. Charles IV was the pope&#x27;s preferred candidate and he was crowned as the King of Romans in November 1346 in Bonn. Charles had been in charge of the administration of Czech Lands since 1333, due to his father&#x27;s absence and health indisposition. Soon after his coronation as the King of Bohemia and the King of Romans, he settled in Prague and laid the foundations of the New Town expanding the capitol. In 1348 he founded the University of Prague, the first university north of Alps and east of Paris. He also legally established the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (&quot;Corona regni Bohemiae&quot; in Latin), meaning the core territories no longer belonged to a king or a dynasty but to the Bohemian monarchy (crown) itself. In 1355, Charles IV travelled to Rome where he was crowned the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. He ruled as the Holy Roman Emperor for over 20 years and managed to secure the title of the King of Romans for his eldest son Wenceslaus IV.

Wenceslaus IV did not share the governance abilities of his father. In 1393, the torture and murder John of Nepomuk – vicar-general of the archbishop Jan of Jenštejn – sparked a noble rebellion. He was imprisoned for two years at Králův Dvůr and was only released after an intervention from his younger brother Sigismund, who had become the King of Hungary. In 1400, Wenceslaus IV was deposed as the Holy Roman Emperor, mainly due to his failure to address the Papal Schism. Two years later, Wenceslaus IV was briefly imprisoned again, this time by his brother Sigismund, who looted Moravia. After the death of Rupert – who had replaced Wenceslaus as the King of Romans – Wenceslaus IV competed with his brother Sigismund and his cousin Jobst of Moravia for the title of the King of Romans. He ultimately surrendered the title to Sigismund in exchange for keeping Bohemia. In 1414, Sigismund called the Council of Constance, which finally resolved the Papal Schism. It also condemned the teaching of Jan Hus, rector of the University of Prague and a popular church reformist. After Jan Hus refused to retract his teachings, he was burnt alive at stake, which prompted the Hussite Wars. The religious military conflicts stopped in 1434 with the battle Battle of Lipany, but the religious tensions continued on. Although Sigismund became the titular King of Bohemia after Wenceslaus IV&#x27;s death in 1419, it was not until 1436 that he was recognized by the Czech Estates and he died a year after.

====House of Habsburg====
After Sigismunds&#x27;s death the title of the King of Bohemia went to his son-in-law Albert from the House of Habsburg, who died shortly after. The claim to the Lands of the Bohemian Crown was passed to his unborn son Ladislaus, who gained the nickname &quot;Posthumous&quot;. He was raised at the court of his distant relative Emperor Frederick III. Although he was crowned the King of Bohemia in 1453, his regent George of Poděbrady continued to effectively rule Bohemia in his stead. Ladislaus died in Prague after fleeing a rebellion in Hungary, aged only seventeen. Many of his contemporaries suspected he was poisoned, but modern examinations of his skeleton proved he died of acute leukemia. With his death the Albertinian Line of the House of Habsburg ended.
====House of Poděbrady====
In 1458, the estates of Bohemia elected George of Poděbrady as the new King of Bohemia. He had a difficult role trying to maintain a fragile peace between the Catholic side and the Hussite side, for which he earned the nickname &quot;King of two peoples&quot;. Despite his efforts, he ultimately did not succeed and in 1465, the catholic nobles formed the Unity of Green Mountain and challenged his rule. A year after, he was excommunicated by the new Pope Paul II, which gave a justification for the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus to invade the Czech Lands and start the Bohemian–Hungarian War. &lt;br&gt;
====House of Jagiellon====
After the king George&#x27;s death, the war was continued by Vladislaus II from the House of Jagiellon, who was offered the throne of Bohemia by George of Poděbrady himself. After ten years of fighting, the Bohemian-Hungarian War finally ended by signing of the Peace of Olomouc in 1479, in which Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia were ceded to Matthias Corvinus for the rest of his life and both monarchs were allowed to use the title of King of Bohemia. In 1485, Vladislaus II confirmed right of all Bohemian noblemen and commoners to freely adhere either to Hussitism or Catholicism in the Peace of Kutná Hora. After Matthias Corvinus died in 1490, Vladislaus II was elected the King of Hungary and gained all the territories he ceded 30 years earlier. From then on he ruled from Buda. Although Vladislaus II was married three times, he only had two children late in his life: son Louis and daughter Anne. Vladislaus II&#x27;s two children married two children of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I as a result of negotiations at the First Congress of Vienna, tying the House of Jagiellon and the House of Habsburg together.

A year after that, in 1516, Vladislaus II died and his ten-year-old son Louis II became the king of both Hungary and Bohemia. In 1521 he refused to pay the agreed annual tribute to the new Ottoman sultan, Süleyman I and executed his ambassadors. War ensued, Belgrade fell to Ottoman hands the same year. In 1526, Louis II led his forces against Suleiman I in the Battle of Mohács, which ended with a decisive defeat of the Hungarian army and Louis II drowned during his attempted retreat. He left no heirs and so the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were inherited by Ferdinand I from the House of Habsburg, as was agreed during the First Congress of Vienna.

==Part of Habsburg Monarchy==

===Protestantism===
After the Battle of Mohács, the Ottomans were unsuccessful in their Siege of Vienna in 1529 and Ferdinand I managed to sign the Treaty of Constantinopole, postponing the Ottoman expansion attempts. Ferdinand and his brother Charles V – who was the Holy Roman Emperor at the same time – had to deal with not only the Ottoman threat, but also with the Schmalkaldic League which formed in 1531 to advance the interests of Lutheran states in the Holy Roman Empire. Largely Protestant Czech nobility had a favorable view of the Schmalkaldic League&#x27;s goals and so when in 1546 Ferdinand I ordered the Czech estates to raise their army and march against the Protestant Electorate of Saxony as part of the Schmalkaldic War, they did so very reluctantly. The next year the Czech estates refused to gather an army again and rebelled, for which they were punished after the Schmalkaldic League decisively lost the Battle of Mühlberg. As a result, Ferdinand I managed to strengthen his position in the Land of the Bohemian Crown, limit city privileges and begin the process of recatholicization by inviting the Jesuit Order to Prague in 1556. &lt;br&gt;

From 1599 to 1711, Moravia (a Land of the Bohemian Crown) was frequently subjected to raids by the Ottoman Empire and its vassals (especially the Tatars and Transylvania). Overall, hundreds of thousands were enslaved whilst tens of thousands were killed.

Maximilian II succeeded Ferdinand I in 1562 and – like his father – ruled from Vienna. He approved Czech Confession (&quot;Confessio Bohemica&quot; in Latin) – a new document confirming religious freedoms – replacing the older Compacts of Basel, that did not take non-Utraquist Protestants into account. He also showed his religious tolerance by reaffirming the Statuta Judaeorum – a document providing legal protection for the Jews in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. His son Rudolf II succeeded him in 1576 and in 1583 he moved the royal court to Prague. Thanks to Rudolf&#x27;s patronage of art, Prague became a major cultural hub of Europe during his reign. He was a reclusive ruler who preferred his hobbies to the daily affairs of the state. In 1605 Rudolf II was forced by his other family members to cede the rule of Hungary to his younger brother Archduke Matthias following the Bocskai Uprising after the Long Turkish War. The differences of opinions between the two brothers ultimately resulted in Rudolf&#x27;s imprisonment at the Prague Castle and all effective power was given into the hands of Matthias. After Rudolf II&#x27;s death in 1612 the royal court moved back to Vienna. Matthias did not have any children – same as his brother Rudolf – and he died six years later, aged 62. &lt;br&gt;
He was succeeded by his cousin Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria. The Diets of Bohemia confirmed Ferdinand&#x27;s position as Matthias&#x27; successor only after he had promised to respect the Letter of Majesty – a document granting religious freedoms, signed by Rudolf II. eight years earlier. Ferdinand II did not share the religious benevolence of his predecessors. A year after he was crowned, he prohibited the construction of Protestant ecclesial buildings on royal land. That led to protests among the Protestant nobility – who saw it as a violation of the Letter of Majesty – and the Second Defenestration of Prague in 1618, which sparked the conflict that would become the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The revolting Bohemian estates then chose Frederick V of Palatinate as their new king and gathered an army in preparation of war. They were joined by Lutheran nobility in Austria. Ferdinand II asked his Spanish relative Philip III for help. Spanish army in the Netherlands made sure forces of Protestant Union could not join the revolt happening in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown and in Austria. After dealing with the Austrian rebels, Ferdinand II decisively defeated Frederick V at the Battle of White Mountain, near Prague. Widespread confiscation of property followed, which was then sold to loyal nobles, often of foreign origin. Ferdinand II also had the 27 leaders of the revolt publicly beheaded and strengthened the royal power over the estates. The Lands of the Bohemian Crown and especially Silesia were some of the territories that were hit the hardest by the devastating Thirty Years&#x27; War. The war continued even after Ferdinand II&#x27;s death during the reign of Ferdinand III.

===Absolutism and National Revival===
====Late Habsburgs====

In 1648, the Thirty Years&#x27; War finally ended with the Peace of Westphalia. Ferdinand III continued the recatholicization and centralization policies of his father. After his death in 1657, he was succeeded by his only surviving son Leopold I. During the fourth Austro-Turkish War in 1663 the Turkish army invaded Moravia before being stopped in the Battle of Saint Gotthard. Leopold continued waging wars with Ottomans and France throughout his long rule. He increased corvée to three days a week which caused the Peasant Revolt of 1680. The infamous Losiny Estate Witch Trials took place between 1678 and 1696 resulting in almost 100 dead. More protests against the increased corvée occurred, but all in vain. In 1705, Leopold I&#x27;s rule ended and his son Joseph I succeeded him. Joseph I planned to enact many administrative reforms, most of which he did not get the chance to finish, due to his premature death of smallpox. One year before his death he issued letters patent ordering that all Romani people in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown had one of their ears cut off. If they returned after being expelled, all Romani men were to be hanged without a trial. Similar letters patents were published in other territories under his rule and led to mass killings of Romani people. After Joseph I&#x27;s premature death in 1711, the Austrian throne went to his younger brother Charles VI. &lt;br&gt;
Charles VI had no male heirs and with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 he ensured that all the titles held by him could be inherited by a woman. Charles VI sought the other European powers&#x27; approval, which he gained in exchange for various concessions. Regardless, after her father&#x27;s death, Maria Theresa had to defend her inheritance from the coalition of Prussia, Bavaria, France, Spain, Saxony and Poland in the War of Austrian Succession, that broke out mere weeks after her coronation in 1740. She ultimately managed to defend her title, but paid for it with the loss of Silesia, which became a part of Prussia. That was the ended the unity of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. In 1757 during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Prussians invaded Bohemia again and laid siege to Prague, but subsequently lost the Battle of Kolín and were repelled. Maria Theresa was not able to regain Silesia and the war ended in a draw. She tried to follow the ideas of Enlightenment, she established compulsory secular primary schools, but also state censorship of books that were deemed to be against the Catholic religion. Because of her marriage to Francis Stephen of Lorraine, all of her children were considered to be members of a new joint House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

====House of Habsburg–Lorraine====
After the death of Maria Theresa&#x27;s husband in 1765, her son Joseph II started to rule with her as a co-ruler and since 1780 as the sole ruler. He enforced many reforms, among the most notable are the abolition of serfdom, Patent of Toleration expanding religious freedom and the dissolution of all monastic orders not involved in education, healthcare or science. As part of his centralization efforts, he also pressed for the expansion of German language to all territories under his rule. Both of his wives died relatively young of smallpox and because he had no sons, he was succeeded by his younger brother Leopold II. Although Leopold II only ruled for two years, he spent several weeks in Prague in 1791 and he let himself be crowned the King of Bohemia. The first Czech Industrial Exhibition was prepared in honor of his visit in Clementinum and the Czech Estates commissioned an opera from Mozart for the occasion. Leopold II was succeeded by Francis I, the first-born of his 12 sons. &lt;br&gt;
In 1805, Napoleon&#x27;s army attacked Austria and defeated the Austrian and Russian army in the decisive Battle of Austerlitz in south Moravia. In the Peace of Pressburg, Francis I lost many of his territories and soon after, the Holy Roman Empire dissolved, replaced by the Confederation of the Rhine. Following the end of Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna reinstated the Austrian Empire as one of the Great Powers of Europe in 1815. Francis I was a proponent of conservatism and his policies suppressed all of the emerging liberal and nationalist movements in his Empire. He was the first of Austrian monarchs to widely utilize the secret police and he increased censorship. His son Ferdinand I became the Austrian Emperor after him. Because of his frequent seizures, he was not capable of ruling and the actual executive power was held by the Regent&#x27;s Council. In 1836, one year after his succession, he was crowned the King of Bohemia under the name of Ferdinand V. &lt;br&gt;

Throughout the 19th century, the nationalist tendencies and movements in the Czech lands known as the Czech National Revival slowly grew, led by activists such as linguists Josef Dobrovský and Josef Jungmann, historian and politician František Palacký or writer Božena Němcová and journalist Karel Havlíček Borovský. The efforts of the Czech National Revival first peaked during the revolutions of 1848. Ferdinand I was forced to abdicate and his successor was his young nephew Francis Joseph I. When he – after losing the war with Italy in 1859 – also lost the war with Prussia in 1866, the Hungarian representatives forced Francis Joseph I to end his absolutist rule over Hungary in the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. The Czech representatives who hoped for a similar increase in autonomy were left out and the Czech lands remained firmly under the control of Austria.

====Austria-Hungary====
The newly formed Real union of Austria-Hungary lasted for the next half-a-century. The policies suppressing the National Revival in the Czech lands under the Austrian government continued, as well as the suppression of the Slovak National Revival under the Hungarian government. The end of the 19th century also was a time of a demographic boom and a rapid urbanization. Population in centers of industry doubled or tripled within a few decades. At the start of the 20th century, Austria&#x27;s unilateral annexation of Bosnia in 1908 caused the Bosnian Crisis and prompted the eventual assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, sparking the World War I in 1914. Many of the Czech nationalists saw the war as an opportunity for gaining full independence from the Austria-Hungary. Desertion among the Czech conscripts was commonplace and Czechoslovak Legions were formed to fight for the side of Entente Powers. In the Cleveland Agreement of 1915, the Czech and Slovak representatives declared their goal of creating a common state, based on the right of a people to self-determination. When the World War I ended in 1918, the Kingdom of Bohemia officially ceased to exist and a new democratic republic of Czechoslovakia took its place.

==Modern times==
===Czechoslovakia===
The republic of Czechoslovakia was declared in October 1918. It was a democratic presidential republic. In 1920, its defined territory was not inhabited only by Czechs and Slovaks, it contained significant populations of other nationalities: Germans (22.95%), Hungarians (5.47%) and Ruthenians (3.39%). The Great Depression starting at the end of 1920&#x27;s together with the rise of the National Socialist Party in neighbouring Germany during the 1930s caused increasing tensions between the different nationalist groups in Czechoslovakia. In foreign relations the newly established republic relied heavily on its western allies of Great Britain and France. That proved to be a mistake as in 1938, both allied countries agreed to Hitler&#x27;s demands and co-signed the Munich Treaty, stripping the Czechoslovakia of its borderlands, leaving it indefensible.

===German protectorate===
After giving up Sudetenland, the Second Czechoslovak Republic lasted only half-a-year before its full dismemberment before the start of World War II. The Slovak Republic declared its independence from Czechoslovakia and became Germany&#x27;s client state, while two days later the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was proclaimed. During World War II – given the high level of industrialization of pre-war Czechoslovakia – the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia served as a major hub of military production for Germany. The oppression of ethnic Czechs increased after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich by members of the Czech resistance in 1942. After Germany&#x27;s defeat in 1945, the vast majority of ethnic Germans were forcefully deported from Czechoslovakia.

===Rule of the Communist Party===

In February 1948, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia seized power in a coup d&#x27;état. Klement Gottwald became the first communist president. He nationalized the country&#x27;s industry and collectivized its farms to form Sovkhozs inspired by the Soviet model. Czechoslovakia thus became a part of the Eastern Bloc. Attempts at a reformation of the political system during the Prague Spring of 1968 were ended by the invasion of armies of the Warsaw Pact. The Czechoslovakia remained under the rule of the Communist Party until the Velvet Revolution of 1989.

===Post-Cold War===

One of the leaders of the dissent, Václav Havel became the first president of the democratic Czechoslovakia. Slovakia&#x27;s demands for sovereignty were fulfilled at the end of 1992, when the representatives of Czechs and Slovaks agreed to split the Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The official start of the current Czech Republic was set on 1 January 1993. The Czech Republic became a member of NATO in 12 March 1999, and the European Union in 1 May 2004.

<doc id="53939" wikidata="Q218010" url="?curid=53939" title="Euro coins">
<text>There are eight euro coin denominations, ranging from one cent to two euro (the euro is divided into a hundred cents). The coins first came into use in 2002. They have a common reverse, portraying a map of Europe, but each country in the eurozone has its own design on the obverse, which means that each coin has a variety of different designs in circulation at once. Four European microstates that are not members of the European Union (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) use the euro as their currency and also have the right to mint coins with their own designs on the obverse side.

The coins, and various commemorative coins, are minted at numerous national mints across the eurozone to strict national quotas. Not every eurozone member state has its own mint. Obverse designs are chosen nationally, while the reverse and the currency as a whole is managed by the European Central Bank (ECB).

==History==
The euro came into existence on 1 January 1999. It had been a goal of the European Union (EU) and its predecessors since the 1960s. The Maastricht Treaty entered into force in 1993 with the goal of creating economic and monetary union by 1999 for all EU states except the United Kingdom and Denmark (even though Denmark has a fixed exchange rate policy with the euro).

In 1999, the currency was born virtually and in 2002 notes and coins began to circulate. It rapidly replaced the former national currencies and the eurozone has since expanded further to some newer EU states. In 2009 the Lisbon Treaty formalised its political authority, the Eurogroup, alongside the European Central Bank.

In 2004, €2 commemorative coins were allowed to be minted in six states. By 2007, all states but France, Ireland and the Netherlands had minted a commemorative issue and the first eurozone-wide commemorative coin was issued to celebrate 50 years of the Treaty of Rome. In 2009, the second eurozone-wide issue of a 2-euro commemorative coin was issued, celebrating ten years of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

In 2012, the third eurozone-wide issue of a 2-euro commemorative coin was issued, celebrating 10 years of euro coins and notes. Cyprus did not independently issue a €2 commemorative coin until 2017.

As the EU&#x27;s membership has since expanded in 2004, 2007 and 2013, with further expansions envisaged, the common face of all euro coins from the value of 10c and above were redesigned in 2007 to show a new map.

Slovenia joined the eurozone in 2007, Cyprus and Malta joined in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, Lithuania in 2015 and Croatia in 2023, introducing eight more national-side designs.

Andorra started minting coins in 2014, so by 2023 there are 24 countries with their own national sides in circulation.

Bulgaria is the last EU member state to announce its national design. The design of the euro coins was officially chosen by the Bulgarian National Bank in November 2023 and approved by the Council of the EU in February 2024. The minting of the coins in the necessary quantities will start shortly after the Council of the EU approves Bulgaria to adopt the euro, so that they can be put into circulation from the date of introduction of the euro in Bulgaria.

== Specification ==
There are eight different denominations of euro coins: €0.01, €0.02, €0.05, €0.10, €0.20, €0.50, €1.00 and €2.00 The €0.01, €0.02 and €0.05  coins show Europe in relation to Asia and Africa in the world. The remaining coins show the EU before its enlargement in May 2004 if minted before 1 January 2007, a map of Europe if minted after. Coins from Austria, Italy, San Marino, Portugal and the Vatican City show the map if minted in 2008 or later.

The common side was designed by Luc Luycx of the Royal Belgian Mint. They symbolise the unity of the EU. The national sides were designed by the national central banks of the Eurosystem in separate competitions. There are specifications which apply to all coins such as the requirement of including twelve stars. National designs were not allowed to change until the end of 2008, unless a monarch (whose portrait usually appears on the coins) dies or abdicates. National designs have seen some changes due to a new rule stating that national designs should include the name of the issuing country.

The common side of the €0.01, €0.02 and €0.05 coins depict the denomination, the words &#x27;EURO CENT&#x27; beside it, twelve stars and Europe highlighted on a globe in relation to Asia and Africa in the world. The common side of the €0.10, €0.20 and €0.50 coins currently depict the denomination on the right, the words &#x27;EURO CENT&#x27; underneath it, with twelve stars and the European continent on the left.

Coins minted from 1999 to 2006 depicted only the EU15, rather than the entire European continent, which is on coins minted after 2007. The common side of the €1 and €2 coins depict the denomination on the left, the currency, map of Europe and twelve stars on the right. Similarly, coins minted from 1999 to 2006 depicted the EU15, rather than the whole European continent, which is on coins minted from 2007.
The 1c, 2c and 5c coins, however, keep their old design, showing a geographical map of Europe with the 15 member states of 2002 raised somewhat above the rest of the map.

== Design ==
=== Common side ===
All coins have a common reverse side showing how much the coin is worth, with a design by Belgian designer Luc Luycx. The design of the 1c, 2c and 5c coins shows Europe&#x27;s place in the world as a whole. The 10c coins and above show either the 15 countries that were the European Union in 2002, or, if minted after 2007, the whole European continent. Coins from Italy, San Marino, the Vatican, Austria and Portugal show the new design if minted 2008 or later. The coins symbolise the unity of the EU.

==== Current design ====
On 2005 June 7, the European Council decided that the common side of the 10 euro cent to €2 coins should be brought up to date to reflect the enlargement of the EU in 2004. The 1c, 2c and 5c coins show Europe in relation to the rest of the world, therefore they remained unchanged. In 2007, the new design was introduced. The design still retains all elements of the original designs, including the twelve stars, but the map of the fifteen states is replaced by one showing the whole of Europe as a continent, without borders, to stress unity. These coins were not mandatory for existing eurozone members when introduced in 2007, but became so for every member in 2008.

Starting in 2017 the 1, 2, and 5 euro cent coins from individual member states have started adjusting their common side design to a new version, identified by smaller and more rounded numeral and longer lines outside of the stars at the coin&#x27;s circumference.

Cyprus is shown several hundred kilometers northwest of its real position in order to include it on the map. On the €1 and €2 coins, the island is shown to be directly east of mainland Greece; on the €0.10, €0.20 and €0.50 coins, it appears directly below Crete. The original proposal from the European Commission was to include Turkey on the map, but this design was rejected by the Council.

==== Initial design ====
The original designs of the 10c, 20c and 50c coins showed the outline of each of the 15 EU member states. Each state was shown as separate from the others, thus giving Europe the appearance of an archipelago. EU member states outside the eurozone (Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) were also depicted. Non-EU states were not depicted.

On the €1 and €2 coins, the landmass appeared more cohesive although borders were indicated. As in current issues, all coins featured 12 stars in their design.

The year featured on the coins can date back to 1999, when the currency was formally established (only Belgian, Dutch, Finnish, French and Spanish coins were struck with the 1999 date). These countries traditionally strike coins with the year of minting rather than the year it was put into circulation.

Researchers from the University of Zürich warned that an external ring of metal surrounding an inner pill of a different colour, as in the euro coins, can lead to the release of high levels of nickel, causing allergic reactions with people sensitive to the metal. The researchers also warned that the coins could contain between 240 and 320 times the amount of nickel allowed under the EU nickel directive.

=== National sides ===
The obverse side varies from state to state, with each member allowed to choose its own design. Each of the eight coins can have the same design (such as Irish coins), or can vary from coin to coin (such as Italian coins). In monarchies, the national side usually features a portrait of the country&#x27;s monarch, often in a design carried over from the former currency (e.g. Belgian coins). Republics tend to feature national monuments, symbols, or stylised designs (such as French coins). Engravings on the edge of the €2 coin are also subject to national choice.

There are at present no plans to abolish the national designs in favour of a common European one. However, the Commission has proposed that the 1c, 2c and 5c coins have a common design to keep costs down.

Though they are not members of the EU, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City (and Andorra since 2014) also have euro coins featuring a national side, but a considerable number of these coins were not put into general circulation by the authorities who instead sold them to collectors for prices higher than their face value. Due to this, in 2012, a European Regulation established that: &quot;A minor proportion, not exceeding 5 % of the cumulated total net value and volume of circulation coins issued by a Member State, taking into account only years with positive net issuance, may be put on the market above face value if justified by the special quality of the coin, a special packaging or any additional services provided&quot;.

No territories associated with eurozone countries issue their own euro coins. France and the Netherlands have overseas regions with their own currencies.

As of 2023, 24 countries issue euro coins with their own national sides, for a total 192 different euro coins, not counting annual differences or commemorative coins.

==== Regulations ====
The basis for the euro coins is derived from a European recommendation from 2003, which allowed changing the national obverse sides of euro coins from 1 January 2004 onwards. However, a number of recommendations and restrictions still apply.

Euro coins must still have a common reverse side, so only the national obverse sides may be varied. Also, the standard national obverse sides &quot;per se&quot; should not be changed before 2008 at the earliest, unless the head of state depicted on some coins changes before then. (This clause already came into effect for Monaco and the Vatican City, whose heads of state—Rainier III and Pope John Paul II respectively—died in 2005 and whose national obverse sides were changed for 2006).

In 2005, another recommendation added two more guidelines regarding the design of the coins. The state issuing a coin should in some way clearly be identified on the obverse side, either by stating the full name or a clearly identifiable abbreviation of it; and neither name nor the denomination of the coin should be repeated on the obverse, as it is already featured on the common reverse side.

These restrictions do not apply retroactively; only new designs—the national obverse sides for regular issues of states newly joining the euro or of eurozone states which change their design, and €2 commemorative coins issued from 2006 onwards—are subject to them. However, the five countries whose designs violated the first update to the rules (Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany and Greece) initially were assumed to have to change their design in the future, which Finland did for 2007 and Belgium for 2008.

In 2008, another recommendation changed the rules again:
* The twelve stars of the European Union surrounding the coin designs need to surround the national design, including year marks and the name of the country. The stars have to appear in the same way as they are aligned on the flag of the European Union.
* The design of euro coins may not be changed except for two specific circumstances:
** If a coin design is in violation of the recommendations, it may be updated to bring it into line with them.
** If a coin design depicts a head of state, it may be updated:
::# every fifteen years to bring it into line with the head of state&#x27;s current appearance;
::# if the head of state abdicates or dies. However, temporary heads of state may not be used as a reason for changing the design; instead a €2 commemorative coin (potentially a second €2 commemorative coin) will be allowed to be issued.

Finland and Belgium had already corrected their design on the coins issued to include the initials of the country in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Belgium was forced to change its design back to show the original portrait of its monarch, because the 2008 update to follow the recommendations also updated the portrait, which was against the rules. The Belgian coins from 2009 onwards show the original royal portrait of 1999, but otherwise keep the new 2008 coin design as far as the country identification and year mark are concerned. These provisions additionally prohibit further &quot;sede vacante&quot; sets of coins by the Vatican City, allowing only commemorative coins for such occasions. Finland and Spain updated their designs to meet the new rules about the stars in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

In 2012, a European Regulation approved new specifications of euro coins and named (in article 1 g) a deadline for national sides of regular coins to be updated to fully comply with the current regulation: 20 June 2062.
* The national side of circulation coins shall not repeat any indication of the denomination, or any parts thereof, of the coin. It shall not repeat the name of the single currency or of its subdivision, unless such indication stems from the use of a different alphabet. However, the edge lettering of the 2-euro coin may include an indication of the denomination, provided that only the figure &quot;2&quot; or the term &quot;euro&quot; in the relevant alphabet, or both, are used.
* The national side of all denominations of circulation coins shall bear an indication of the issuing Member State by means of the Member State&#x27;s name or an abbreviation of it.
* The national side of circulation coins shall bear a circle of 12 stars that shall fully surround the national design, including the year mark and the indication of the issuing Member State&#x27;s name. This shall not prevent some design elements from extending into the circle of stars, provided that the stars are all clearly and fully visible. The 12 stars shall be depicted as on the Union flag.
* Changes to the designs used for the national sides of regular coins may only be made once every 15 years, without prejudice to changes necessary to prevent counterfeiting of the currency. Without prejudice of the previous, changes to the designs used for the national sides of regular coins may be made where the Head of State referred to on a coin changes. However, a temporary vacancy or the provisional occupation of the function of Head of State shall not give any additional right to such change.
* Issuing Member States shall update their national sides of regular coins in order to fully comply with this Regulation by 20 June 2062.

In 2014, a new Regulation regarding euro coins was approved. In it, no changes related to what was mentioned above were established.

, Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands, Spain and Vatican City have all experienced a change in head of state and have revised their designs to reflect this and the new regulation where applicable.

In 2022, France came to comply with the stars&#x27; rule after the design change it made on the 1 and 2 euro coins, in which the year had until then been inserted between the stars of the Union.

, Austria, Germany and Greece still have to include an indication of the issuing Member State. Additionally, Greece, Luxembourg and Slovenia have to comply with the rule of the stars. Finally, Austria must eliminate the denominations on the national side of their euro coins.

Bear in mind that the foregoing refers to &quot;regular&quot; coins since, in the case of the 2 euro commemorative coins, the aforementioned is fulfilled in all coins since 2013. This is due to the fact that each one of these coins supposes a variation in the design, while, as mentioned, &quot;regular&quot; coins were not affected unless the design of the national sides was changed, and have until June 20, 2062 in the event that the design had not been changed before.

Finally, the different States must inform each other of their new draft designs (both of &quot;regular&quot; and 2 euro commemorative coins), as well as the European Council and the European Commission, which must give its approval. In one example, the initial design of Andorran 10, 20 and 50 cent coins did not obtain EU approval because the image of the &quot;Pantokrator of San Martí de la Cortinada&quot;, included in those coins, violated the principle of religious neutrality. The image of the religious figure was eliminated in the final Andorran coin design. Another example, the 2 euro commemorative coins that Belgium planned to issue in 2015 on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, caused complaints by France and withdrawal of the design. However, Belgium did issue a 2.50 euro collector&#x27;s coin, taking advantage of the fact that these coins are not submitted to the draft design approval.

=== Security features ===
Euro coins have high-security machine-readable features. Sophisticated bi-metal and sandwich technologies have been put into the €1 and €2 coins. The 10c, 20c and 50c coins are made of Nordic gold, which is a unique alloy, difficult to melt and used exclusively for coins. The lettering on the edge of the €2 coin also protects it from counterfeiting.

=== Features for persons with impaired sight ===
Euro coins were designed in cooperation with organisations representing blind people, and as a result incorporate many features allowing them to be distinguished by touch alone. In addition, their visual appearance is designed to make them easy to tell apart for persons who cannot read the inscriptions on the coins.

The coins increase in size and weight with value. Of the eight denominations of euro coins, the three lowest denominations are small, resemble copper in colour and are quite thin and light. The next three denominations resemble gold in colour and are thicker as well as heavier. The highest two denominations are bimetallic, being generally larger and thicker than the lower denominations.

In general, the greater the value, the heavier and larger the coin. Copper colour identifies low value; gold colour identifies medium value; two different metals identify high value.

There are also differences within each group. The 2 cent coin has a grooved edge to distinguish it from the 1 and 5 cent coins and also from the US penny, which has the same colour and diameter. Similarly, the 20 cent coin edge is smooth with seven indents to distinguish it from the 10 and 50 cent coins.

While currencies predating the euro were specifically designed in similar ways (different sizes, colours, and ridges) to aid the visually impaired, the euro was the first to have authorities consult organizations representing the blind and visually impaired before the release of the currency.

==Commemorative issues==

Each state may also mint two 2 euro commemorative coins each year from June 2012. From 2004 to May 2012, countries were only allowed to mint one coin per year. Only €2 coins may be used in this way (for them to be legal tender) and there is a limit on the number that can be issued. The coin must adhere to the normal design criteria, such as the twelve stars, the year and the issuing country.

Greece was the first country to issue a commemorative coin, and was followed by other countries. In 2007, every eurozone state participated in the Treaty of Rome programme, in which all member states issued a coin of similar design to commemorate the signing of the Treaty, only differing in the name of the issuing country and language of the text. This was also the case in 2009, in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Economic and Monetary Union. The design was selected by electronic voting by EU citizens. In 2012, a common commemorative coin was issued to commemorate the tenth anniversary of euro coins and banknotes. In 2015, a common commemorative coin was issued to commemorate 30 years of the European Union flag. Finally, in 2022 a common commemorative coin was issued to commemorate 35 years of the Erasmus Programme.

In 2006, Germany began issuing a series of coins, the German Bundesländer series, showing each of the states of Germany on its coins; It was originally intended to run until 2021, but one extra issue was added in 2019, which pushed back the last three planned issues (2019, 2020, 2021) by one year. The series ended in 2022. In 2023 a new series (Bundesländer series II) began until 2038.

Spain started a commemorative coin series &quot;&quot; (UNESCO World Heritage) in 2010, commemorating all of Spain&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites, which is currently planned until 2058. The order in which the coin for a specific site is issued coincides with the order in which they were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site.

In 2021, France started a commemorative coin series about 2024 Summer Olympics. It will be finished in 2024.

Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Malta have also issued a series of 2 euro commemorative coins.

===Gold and silver commemorative issues===

A legacy of old national practice is the minting of silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender throughout the eurozone, but only in the country where they are issued (e.g. a €10 Finnish commemorative coin cannot be used in Portugal).

However, these gold coins are intended for collectors as their bullion value vastly exceeds their face value. Some silver coins, such as the German €10 commemoratives, are often available at banks and some retailers at face value. These coins, however, generally do not circulate but are kept by collectors.

It is uncertain whether the EU Council of Ministers will grant such coins legal tender status outside national boundaries, as Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City also issue this kind of coin.

===Belgian 2.50 euro coin===
In 2015, Belgium issued a 2.50 euro commemorative coin which is legal tender inside the country. 70,000 coins were minted, commemorating the 200th anniversary of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of Waterloo.

Belgium originally planned to mint 2 euro commemorative coins for the occasion. This plan was blocked by France, however (after 180,000 of the coins had already been minted; they had to be discarded). Minting the 2.50 euro denomination obviated France&#x27;s complaints as the coins are not legal tender in the European Union, only in Belgium.

EU law states that any country can issue any new coins it wants as long as they are in an irregular denomination, so it invented a €2.50 coin.

== Circulation ==
The European Central Bank closely monitors the circulation and stock of the euro coins and banknotes. It is a task of the Eurosystem to ensure an efficient and smooth supply of euro coins and to maintain their integrity throughout the eurozone.

=== Statistics ===
As of December 2021, there are approximately 141 billion coins in circulation around the eurozone. In contrast, the United States has minted over 300 billion pennies since 1983 when the current copper-plated zinc metallic composition began. Using a population of 341.9 million for the euro area, that is roughly 199 coins of denomination 1c or 2c per capita, and 215 other coins per capita.


=== Counterfeiting ===
Approximately 100,000 counterfeit euro coins are taken from circulation annually, and roughly the same number are seized before they can be released. Given a total circulation of 56 billion coins, counterfeit coins are relatively rare. About half the counterfeits feature the German national design, but counterfeits have been detected for every issuing country. The majority of counterfeit coins are €2 (60% in 2011), with most of the rest being €1, and a few 50c coins. The number of counterfeit €2 coins being found annually is decreasing, while numbers of counterfeit €1 and 50-cent coins are increasing.

The European Technical and Scientific Centre (ETSC) estimates that up to 2 million counterfeit coins were put into circulation in 2002.

Recent investigations by the European Commission have shown that counterfeit sophistication is increasing, making prompt detection more difficult. In 2008, Irish MEP Eoin Ryan called for tighter regulation over tokens and medals that are being increasingly used for small purchases mainly in vending machines across Europe.

==Small-denomination coins==

The 1c, 2c, and 5c coins account for approximately 80% of all new coins minted in the eurozone. Due to the expense of producing such low-value coinage, the Commission and some member states have proposed that costs could be cut by having a common design on both sides of these coins, rather than minting numerous different designs.

The €1 and €2 coins are two-toned. The &quot;gold&quot; is an alloy, 75% copper, 20% zinc and 5% nickel. The &quot;silver&quot; is cupronickel, 75% copper and 25% nickel. The 10c, 20c and 50c coins are a proprietary alloy known as &quot;Nordic Gold&quot;, consisting of 89% copper, 5% aluminium, 5% zinc and 1% tin. The 1c, 2c, and 5c coins are copper-coated steel fourrées. The copper alloys make the coinage antimicrobial.

===Price rounding===
The 1c and 2c coins were initially introduced to ensure that the introduction of the euro was not used as an excuse by retailers to heavily round up prices. However, due to the cost of maintaining a circulation of low-value coins, both by business and the mints, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Slovakia round prices to the nearest five cents (Swedish rounding) if paying with cash, while producing only a handful of those coins for collectors, rather than general circulation. The coins are still legal tender and produced outside these states.

==== Countries with Swedish rounding ====
The Swedish rounding law in Finland was issued in January 2002, shortly after the coins were put into circulation.

The Netherlands followed suit in September 2004, under pressure from retail businesses, which claimed that dealing with 1- and 2-cent coins was too expensive. After a successful experiment in the town of Woerden in May 2004, retailers across the Netherlands were permitted in September 2004 to round cash transactions to the nearest five cents.

In Belgium, rounding has been common practice since 2014; by law, rounding has been obligatory for cash purchases since 1 December 2019. For payments with debit or credit cards, the merchant can choose whether to apply rounding but has to inform the client beforehand. With the obligatory rounding in effect, Belgium&#x27;s National Bank has stopped production of 1- and 2-cent coins.

Ireland introduced rounding in 2015 after a 2013 trial in Wexford.

In May 2017, the Italian parliament passed a resolution to stop minting 1c and 2c coins starting 1 January 2018 and to introduce Swedish rounding.

The withdrawal of low-circulation coins is due in part to rising metal prices: De Nederlandsche Bank calculated it would save $36 million a year by not using the smaller coins. Other countries such as Germany favoured retaining the coins due to their desire for €1.99 prices, which appear more attractive to the consumer than a €2 price. According to James Debono writing for &quot;Malta Today&quot;, &quot;scrapping the coins is considered unthinkable for Germany where both consumers and retailers are obsessed with precise pricing.&quot; Luxembourg and Malta also declared that they do not wish to remove the coins. This is echoed by the European Central Bank which supports the coins, stating it allows businesses to calculate prices more exactly to attract consumers, such as €0.99. 

According to a 2005 Eurobarometer survey of EU citizens, Germans were most sceptical about the removal of the 1c and 2c coins from complete circulation in the eurozone, but on average a majority of Germans still supported their removal (58% for the one cent coin and 52% for the two cent coin in 2005). The Belgians were most supportive of their removal. A similar survey in 2017 found 64% across the eurozone favoring their removal with prices rounded, with over 70% in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Slovakia. Only Portugal and Latvia had a plurality in favour of retaining the coins (49% against removal, 45–46% in favour). The same survey in 2021 found that 67% of respondents across the eurozone were in favor of the removal, and all countries in the eurozone showed a plurality of people also in favor.

The Commission in 2010 released its guidelines on daily life euro cash questions, to give citizens guidelines on issues with direct implications for daily life. The guidelines were based on ten guiding principles, including two that still remain: &quot;No surcharges should be imposed on payments in cash&quot; and &quot;Member States should not adopt new rounding rules to the nearest five cent&quot;. Following a consultation, a Commission initiative considering the adoption of price rounding was due to be adopted by the end of 2021. Regardless of the Commission&#x27;s decision, Slovakia proposed introducing rounding from 2022.

==Controversy==
In spring 2016, controversy arose in the Netherlands after an episode of the television program &quot;Keuringsdienst van Waarde&quot; showed that euro coins for the Netherlands and other countries were being made by South Korean company Poongsan, a known producer of cluster munitions. Cluster munitions are banned internationally by the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), because of their indiscriminate and long-term effects on civilians. The CCM prohibits the use, production, stockpiling or transfer of cluster munitions as well as assistance with these acts. After parliamentary questions were posed, the Dutch government stated that the Royal Dutch Mint had ordered around 40 million &#x27;coin blanks&#x27; between 2011 and 2016, and that Poongsan was on a list of vetted suppliers of the European Commission&#x27;s Mint Directors Working Group. Since then, both the Royal Dutch Mint and the Norwegian Mint have excluded Poongsan as a coin blank supplier due to its involvement with cluster munitions. Questions were also raised that year in the European Parliament about Poongsan&#x27;s presence on the vetted list of coin blank suppliers of the European Commission&#x27;s Mint Directors Working Group. The Commission responded with claims that, despite the European Union&#x27;s support of the CCM, the EU itself is not a Party to it and responsibility on the issue lies with EU member states.

<doc id="53941" wikidata="Q208216" url="?curid=53941" title="Triangle inequality">
<text>In mathematics, the triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side. This statement permits the inclusion of degenerate triangles, but some authors, especially those writing about elementary geometry, will exclude this possibility, thus leaving out the possibility of equality. If , , and are the lengths of the sides of a triangle then the triangle inequality states that
:formula_1
with equality only in the degenerate case of a triangle with zero area.

In Euclidean geometry and some other geometries, the triangle inequality is a theorem about vectors and vector lengths (norms):
:formula_2
where the length of the third side has been replaced by the length of the vector sum . When and are real numbers, they can be viewed as vectors in formula_3, and the triangle inequality expresses a relationship between absolute values.

In Euclidean geometry, for right triangles the triangle inequality is a consequence of the Pythagorean theorem, and for general triangles, a consequence of the law of cosines, although it may be proved without these theorems. The inequality can be viewed intuitively in either formula_4 or formula_5. The figure at the right shows three examples beginning with clear inequality (top) and approaching equality (bottom). In the Euclidean case, equality occurs only if the triangle has a angle and two angles, making the three vertices collinear, as shown in the bottom example. Thus, in Euclidean geometry, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

In spherical geometry, the shortest distance between two points is an arc of a great circle, but the triangle inequality holds provided the restriction is made that the distance between two points on a sphere is the length of a minor spherical line segment (that is, one with central angle in ) with those endpoints.

The triangle inequality is a &quot;defining property&quot; of norms and measures of distance. This property must be established as a theorem for any function proposed for such purposes for each particular space: for example, spaces such as the real numbers, Euclidean spaces, the Lp spaces (), and inner product spaces.

==Euclidean geometry==

Euclid proved the triangle inequality for distances in plane geometry using the construction in the figure. Beginning with triangle , an isosceles triangle is constructed with one side taken as and the other equal leg along the extension of side . It then is argued that angle has larger measure than angle , so side is longer than side . However: 
:formula_6 
so the sum of the lengths of sides and is larger than the length of . This proof appears in Euclid&#x27;s Elements, Book 1, Proposition 20.

===Mathematical expression of the constraint on the sides of a triangle===

For a proper triangle, the triangle inequality, as stated in words, literally translates into three inequalities (given that a proper triangle has side lengths that are all positive and excludes the degenerate case of zero area):
:formula_7
A more succinct form of this inequality system can be shown to be
:formula_8
Another way to state it is
:formula_9
implying
:formula_10
and thus that the longest side length is less than the semiperimeter.

A mathematically equivalent formulation is that the area of a triangle with sides must be a real number greater than zero. Heron&#x27;s formula for the area is

:formula_11

In terms of either area expression, the triangle inequality imposed on all sides is equivalent to the condition that the expression under the square root sign be real and greater than zero (so the area expression is real and greater than zero).

The triangle inequality provides two more interesting constraints for triangles whose sides are , where and formula_12 is the golden ratio, as
:formula_13

:formula_14

===Right triangle===

In the case of right triangles, the triangle inequality specializes to the statement that the hypotenuse is greater than either of the two sides and less than their sum.

The second part of this theorem is already established above for any side of any triangle. The first part is established using the lower figure. In the figure, consider the right triangle . An isosceles triangle is constructed with equal sides . From the triangle postulate, the angles in the right triangle satisfy:
:formula_15
Likewise, in the isosceles triangle , the angles satisfy:
:formula_16
Therefore,
:formula_17
and so, in particular,
:formula_18
That means side , which is opposite to angle , is shorter than side , which is opposite to the larger angle . But . Hence:
:formula_19
A similar construction shows , establishing the theorem.

An alternative proof (also based upon the triangle postulate) proceeds by considering three positions for point : (i) as depicted (which is to be proved), or (ii) coincident with (which would mean the isosceles triangle had two right angles as base angles plus the vertex angle , which would violate the triangle postulate), or lastly, (iii) interior to the right triangle between points and (in which case angle is an exterior angle of a right triangle and therefore larger than , meaning the other base angle of the isosceles triangle also is greater than and their sum exceeds in violation of the triangle postulate).

This theorem establishing inequalities is sharpened by Pythagoras&#x27; theorem to the equality that the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

===Examples of use===
Consider a triangle whose sides are in an arithmetic progression and let the sides be . Then the triangle inequality requires that

:formula_20

To satisfy all these inequalities requires

:formula_21

When is chosen such that , it generates a right triangle that is always similar to the Pythagorean triple with sides , , .

Now consider a triangle whose sides are in a geometric progression and let the sides be . Then the triangle inequality requires that

:formula_22

The first inequality requires ; consequently it can be divided through and eliminated. With , the middle inequality only requires . This now leaves the first and third inequalities needing to satisfy

:formula_23

The first of these quadratic inequalities requires to range in the region beyond the value of the positive root of the quadratic equation , i.e. where is the golden ratio. The second quadratic inequality requires to range between 0 and the positive root of the quadratic equation , i.e. . The combined requirements result in being confined to the range
:formula_24

When the common ratio is chosen such that it generates a right triangle that is always similar to the Kepler triangle.

===Generalization to any polygon===
The triangle inequality can be extended by mathematical induction to arbitrary polygonal paths, showing that the total length of such a path is no less than the length of the straight line between its endpoints. Consequently, the length of any polygon side is always less than the sum of the other polygon side lengths.

====Example of the generalized polygon inequality for a quadrilateral====
Consider a quadrilateral whose sides are in a geometric progression and let the sides be . Then the generalized polygon inequality requires that

:formula_25

These inequalities for reduce to the following

:formula_26
:formula_27
The left-hand side polynomials of these two inequalities have roots that are the tribonacci constant and its reciprocal. Consequently, is limited to the range where is the tribonacci constant.

====Relationship with shortest paths====

This generalization can be used to prove that the shortest curve between two points in Euclidean geometry is a straight line.

No polygonal path between two points is shorter than the line between them. This implies that no curve can have an arc length less than the distance between its endpoints. By definition, the arc length of a curve is the least upper bound of the lengths of all polygonal approximations of the curve. The result for polygonal paths shows that the straight line between the endpoints is the shortest of all the polygonal approximations. Because the arc length of the curve is greater than or equal to the length of every polygonal approximation, the curve itself cannot be shorter than the straight line path.

===Converse===

The converse of the triangle inequality theorem is also true: if three real numbers are such that each is less than the sum of the others, then there exists a triangle with these numbers as its side lengths and with positive area; and if one number equals the sum of the other two, there exists a degenerate triangle (that is, with zero area) with these numbers as its side lengths.

In either case, if the side lengths are , , we can attempt to place a triangle in the Euclidean plane as shown in the diagram. We need to prove that there exists a real number consistent with the values , , and , in which case this triangle exists.

By the Pythagorean theorem we have and according to the figure at the right. Subtracting these yields . This equation allows us to express in terms of the sides of the triangle:
:formula_28
For the height of the triangle we have that . By replacing with the formula given above, we have

:formula_29

For a real number to satisfy this, must be non-negative:
:formula_30
which holds if the triangle inequality is satisfied for all sides. Therefore, there does exist a real number formula_31 consistent with the sides formula_32, and the triangle exists. If each triangle inequality holds strictly, formula_33 and the triangle is non-degenerate (has positive area); but if one of the inequalities holds with equality, so formula_34, the triangle is degenerate.

===Generalization to higher dimensions===


The area of a triangular face of a tetrahedron is less than or equal to the sum of the areas of the other three triangular faces. More generally, in Euclidean space the hypervolume of an -facet of an -simplex is less than or equal to the sum of the hypervolumes of the other facets.

Much as the triangle inequality generalizes to a polygon inequality, the inequality for a simplex of any dimension generalizes to a polytope of any dimension: the hypervolume of any facet of a polytope is less than or equal to the sum of the hypervolumes of the remaining facets.

In some cases the tetrahedral inequality is stronger than several applications of the triangle inequality. For example, the triangle inequality appears to allow the possibility of four points , , , and in Euclidean space such that distances
and
However, points with such distances cannot exist: the area of the equilateral triangle is formula_35, which is larger than three times formula_36, the area of a isosceles triangle (all by Heron&#x27;s formula), and so the arrangement is forbidden by the tetrahedral inequality.

==Normed vector space==

In a normed vector space , one of the defining properties of the norm is the triangle inequality:

:formula_37

That is, the norm of the sum of two vectors is at most as large as the sum of the norms of the two vectors. This is also referred to as subadditivity. For any proposed function to behave as a norm, it must satisfy this requirement.

If the normed space is Euclidean, or, more generally, strictly convex, then formula_38 if and only if the triangle formed by , , and , is degenerate, that is, and are on the same ray, i.e., or , or for some . This property characterizes strictly convex normed spaces such as the spaces with . However, there are normed spaces in which this is not true. For instance, consider the plane with the norm (the Manhattan distance) and denote and . Then the triangle formed by , , and , is non-degenerate but

:formula_39

===Example norms===
The &quot;absolute value&quot; is a norm for the real line; as required, the absolute value satisfies the triangle inequality for any real numbers and . If and have the same sign or either of them is zero, then formula_40 If and have opposite signs, then without loss of generality assume formula_41 Then 

formula_42

The triangle inequality is useful in mathematical analysis for determining the best upper estimate on the size of the sum of two numbers, in terms of the sizes of the individual numbers. There is also a lower estimate, which can be found using the &quot;reverse triangle inequality&quot; which states that for any real numbers and , formula_43

The &quot;taxicab norm&quot; or 1-norm is one generalization absolute value to higher dimensions. To find the norm of a vector formula_44 just add the absolute value of each component separately, formula_45

The &quot;Euclidean norm&quot; or 2-norm defines the length of translation vectors in an -dimensional Euclidean space in terms of a Cartesian coordinate system. For a vector formula_44 its length is defined using the -dimensional Pythagorean theorem: formula_47,

and if formula_48 then trivially formula_49 by the nonnegativity of the norm. 

Thus, in both cases, we find that formula_50.

For metric spaces, the proof of the reverse triangle inequality is found similarly by:

formula_51

formula_52

Putting these equations together we find:

formula_53

And in the converse, beginning from the reverse triangle inequality, we can again use two cases:

If formula_54, then formula_55,

and if formula_56 then formula_57 again by the nonnegativity of the metric. 

Thus, in both cases, we find that formula_58.

==Triangle inequality for cosine similarity==

By applying the cosine function to the triangle inequality and reverse triangle inequality for arc lengths and employing the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosines, it follows immediately that

formula_59

and

formula_60

With these formulas, one needs to compute a square root for each triple of vectors that is examined rather than for each pair of vectors examined, and could be a performance improvement when the number of triples examined is less than the number of pairs examined.

==Reversal in Minkowski space==

The Minkowski space metric formula_61 is not positive-definite, which means that formula_62 can have either sign or vanish, even if the vector is non-zero. Moreover, if and are both timelike vectors lying in the future light cone, the triangle inequality is reversed:

: formula_63

A physical example of this inequality is the twin paradox in special relativity. The same reversed form of the inequality holds if both vectors lie in the past light cone, and if one or both are null vectors. The result holds in formula_64 dimensions for any formula_65. If the plane defined by formula_66 and formula_67 is space-like (and therefore a Euclidean subspace) then the usual triangle inequality holds.

<doc id="53942" wikidata="Q2597534" url="?curid=53942" title="XM2001 Crusader">
<text>The XM2001 Crusader was to be the United States Army&#x27;s next-generation self-propelled howitzer (SPH), designed to improve the survivability, lethality, mobility, and effectiveness of the artillery as well as the overall force. It was initially scheduled for fielding by 2008. United Defense was the prime contractor; General Dynamics the major subcontractor. In early May 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld canceled the US$11 billion program because he considered it neither mobile nor precise enough. The prototype SPH vehicle is on display at the cannon park at Fort Sill.

==Inception==
The Crusader was conceived as the Advanced Field Artillery System (AFAS), part of a family of vehicles built around a common chassis in the Armored Systems Modernization program. In October 1992, the Army canceled Armored Systems Modernization due to changing budgetary priorities caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In 1994 AFAS was renamed &quot;Crusader.&quot;

In 1996, the Crusader&#x27;s experimental liquid propellant system was replaced by more traditional solid propellant bags. In 1997 the Government Accountability Office advised the Army to consider either upgrading the Paladin or to purchase the German Panzerhaubitze 2000 instead.

The Crusader was intended to replace the M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzer and the M992 Field Artillery Ammunition Support Vehicle (FAASV). It was intended to be an automated gun artillery system to support the Interim Brigade Combat Teams (IBCT) Counterattack Corps and a basis for other vehicle developments.

Key features of the Crusader design included:
* A cooled XM297E2 cannon for sustained high rates of fire
* Automated ammunition handling and loading
* Cockpit with embedded command and control
* Composite armor
* Survivability features to protect the vehicle and crew
* GE/Honeywell LV100-5 gas turbine engine to keep up with other fighting vehicles

The Army required that the Crusader was to share a common engine with the M1 Abrams. The principal driver for this change was to shed weight off the Crusader. Caterpillar Inc. proposed a diesel engine, as did a joint venture of General Dynamics and DaimlerChrysler. In September 2000, the Army selected Honeywell&#x27;s LV 100 turbine engine. The Army was to procure as many as 3600 of these, including 2845 for the Abrams and 846 for the Crusader.

Using the same chassis, the resupply vehicles (RSVs) would deliver automatic, reciprocal transfer of ammunition, data and fuel to the SPH or another RSV.

===Program timeline===
* 1QFY95 Approved to commence program definition and risk reduction (PDRR) phase.
* 2QFY98 In-process review completed and manufacture of the PDRR prototype systems begun.
* 3QFY99 Delivery of first RSV prototype.
* 2QFY00 Delivery of first prototype howitzer SPH 1.
* 1QFY02 Successful preliminary design review.
* 1QFY02 More than 4000 rounds fired from SPH 1.
* 2QFY02 Program discontinued.

In October 1999, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki outlined a future that envisioned transforming heavy brigades into lighter brigades outfitted with wheeled Interim Armored Vehicles, later renamed &quot;Stryker.&quot; Shinseki said the priority of a lighter, more mobile army could shift resources from heavier armored vehicle acquisitions. The following month Shinseki said the vehicles were too heavy: the howitzer and its resupply vehicle would weigh a combined 110 tons, more than could be carried by any of the Air Force&#x27;s aircraft, including the C-5 Galaxy if flight rules aren&#x27;t waived. Shinseki spoke with contractor United Defense about bringing down the combined weight of the two vehicles by 20 tons, which United agreed was possible.

In April 2001, a panel convened by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recommended canceling the Crusader and other defense modernization programs. An official involved called the Crusader &quot;a wonderful system -- for a legacy world.&quot;

As of 2002, the Army planned to acquire 480 Crusaders at a program cost of $11 billion.

In February 2002, President George W. Bush allocated $475 million for the Crusader program in the White House&#x27;s 2003 budget proposal, which also proposed increased Pentagon spending by $48 billion.

In April, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, whose concerns about defense modernization overspending had intensified, met with Pentagon officials including Army Secretary Thomas E. White to discuss defense spending cuts to free funding for more essential modernization programs. The officials discussed cuts to the Crusader, RAH-66 Comanche helicopter, and F-22 Raptor. Some officials questioned whether the howitzer was redundant given the parallel development of a lighter howitzer for the Future Combat Systems modernization effort.

On 9 May, Rumsfeld announced that he would ask Congress to cancel the $11 billion program. Days before, Congress members favorable to the Crusader received talking points from Army officials who sought to save the program. The last-minute lobbying prompted anger from Rumsfeld and an internal Army investigation into its congressional liaison office. The investigation culminated with the resignation of the Army official who had distributed the talking points. After being absolved himself of wrongdoing in the matter, Army Secretary White assured that he supported Rumsfeld&#x27;s decision and said the Army was analyzing alternatives to the Crusader including the M982 Excalibur 155-mm guided artillery shell. The House Appropriations Committee responded, after rejecting a measure that would have sustained the program until the fall, asking the Pentagon to delay plans to cancel the Crusader. Later that month President Bush asked Congress to reallocate the Crusader&#x27;s budget towards other Army developmental weapons including $310 million for Future Combat Systems in the proposed 2003 Pentagon budget.

<text>The hippocampus (: hippocampi; via Latin from Greek , &#x27;seahorse&#x27;), also hippocampus proper, is a major component of the brain of humans and many other vertebrates. In the human brain the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, and the subiculum are components of the hippocampal formation located in the limbic system. 
The hippocampus plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory, and in spatial memory that enables navigation. In humans, and other primates the hippocampus is located in the archicortex, one of the three regions of allocortex, in each hemisphere with direct neural projections to, and reciprocal indirect projections from the neocortex. The hippocampus, as the medial pallium, is a structure found in all vertebrates.

In Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (and other forms of dementia), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage; short-term memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms. Damage to the hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation (hypoxia), encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy. People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia: the inability to form and retain new memories.

Since different neuronal cell types are neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently been used as a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was initially discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed to be one of the main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.

In rodents as model organisms, the hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain system responsible for spatial memory and navigation. Many neurons in the rat and mouse hippocampi respond as place cells: that is, they fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a specific part of its environment. Hippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells, whose activity acts as an inertial compass, and conjecturally with grid cells in the neighboring entorhinal cortex.

== Name ==
The earliest description of the ridge running along the floor of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle comes from the Venetian anatomist Julius Caesar Aranzi (1587), who likened it first to a silkworm and then to a seahorse (Latin &quot;hippocampus&quot;, from Greek ἱππόκαμπος, from ἵππος, &#x27;horse&#x27; + κάμπος, &#x27;sea monster&#x27;). The German anatomist Duvernoy (1729), the first to illustrate the structure, also wavered between &quot;seahorse&quot; and &quot;silkworm&quot;. &quot;Ram&#x27;s horn&quot; was proposed by the Danish anatomist Jacob Winsløw in 1732; and a decade later his fellow Parisian, the surgeon de Garengeot, used &quot;cornu Ammonis&quot; – horn of Amun, after the ancient Egyptian god who was often represented as having a ram&#x27;s head. &quot;Ammon&quot; is the Greek name for Amun.

The head region of the hippocampus is enlarged, and presents two or three rounded elevations or foot-like digitations, and hence it was named the pes hippocampi (&quot;pes&quot; meaning &quot;foot&quot;). Later this part was described as &quot;pes hippocampi major&quot;, with an adjacent bulge in the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle, described as &quot;pes hippocampi minor&quot; later renamed as the calcar avis. In 1786 Félix Vicq-d&#x27;Azyr published an authoritative description naming just the &quot;hippocampus&quot; but the term remained largely unused with no description of any function proposed until in the middle of the 20th century it was associated with memory.

Mayer mistakenly used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by some other authors until Karl Friedrich Burdach resolved this error in 1829. In 1861 the hippocampus minor became the center of a dispute over human evolution between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen, satirized as the Great Hippocampus Question. The term hippocampus minor fell from use in anatomy textbooks and was officially removed in the Nomina Anatomica of 1895. Today, the structure is just called the hippocampus, with the term &quot;cornu Ammonis&quot; (that is, &#x27;Ammon&#x27;s horn&#x27;) surviving in the names of the hippocampal subfields CA1–CA4.

==In the limbic system==
The hippocampus is one of the structures of the limbic lobe, first described by Broca in 1878, as the cortical areas that line the deep edge of the cortex. The limbic lobe is the main component of the limbic system. The cingulate gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus are the two main parts of the described lobe, which had been largely associated with olfaction. Many studies later culminating in work by Papez, and MacLean, the involvement of other interacting brain regions associated with emotion was recognised. The hippocampus is anatomically connected to parts of the brain that are involved with emotional behavior, including the septal area, the hypothalamic mammillary bodies, and the anterior nuclear complex in the thalamus. MacLean proposed that the associated structures of the limbic lobe be included in what he termed as the &quot;limbic system&quot;.

==Neuroanatomy==

The hippocampus is a five centimetre long ridge of gray matter tissue within the parahippocampal gyrus that can only be seen when the gyrus is opened up. The hippocampus is an inward fold of three-layered archicortex (one of three regions of the allocortex) into the medial temporal lobe of the brain, where it elevates into the floor of each lateral ventricle inferior horn. The hippocampus stretches along its anterior-posterior axis, from the amygdala to the splenium of the corpus callosum, with the head, body, and tail regions as subdivisions of this axis. The dentate gyrus, CA subfields, fimbria, and subiculum are divisions across the short axis, the proximal-distal axis.

The hippocampal formation refers to the hippocampus, and its related adjoining parts to include the dentate gyrus, the subiculum, the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and the entorhinal cortex. Sometimes the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum are grouped together as the &quot;subicular complex&quot;, but the regions are neuroanatomically distinct. Some sources may only include the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and subiculum, being regions of the hippocampal three-layered archicortex. But the six regions are linked together serially by almost unidirectional neural pathways. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.
The hippocampus, and dentate gyrus that is folded into the hippocampal archicortex have the shape of a curved, rolled-up tube. The curve of the hippocampus (known as &quot;cornu Ammonis&quot;) uses the initial letters &quot;CA&quot; to name the hippocampal subfields CA1-CA4. CA4 is in fact the polymorphic layer or hilus of the dentate gyrus, but CA4 is still sometimes in use to describe the part of CA3 that inserts between the dentate gyrus regions or &quot;blades&quot;.

It can be distinguished as an area where the cortex narrows into a single layer of densely packed pyramidal neurons, which curl into a tight U shape. One edge of the &quot;U,&quot; – (CA4) the hilus of the dentate gyrus, is embedded into the backward-facing, flexed dentate gyrus. In humans the hippocampus is described as having an anterior and posterior part; in other primates they are termed rostral and caudal, and in rodent literature they are the ventral and dorsal part. Both parts are of similar composition but belong to different neural circuits. The dentate gyrus combined with other hippocampal regions form a banana-like structure, with the two hippocampi joined at the stems by the commissure of fornix (also called the hippocampal commissure). In primates, the part of the hippocampus at the bottom, near the base of the temporal lobe, is much broader than the part at the top. This means that in cross-section the hippocampus can show a number of different shapes, depending on the angle and location of the cut.

In a cross-section of the hippocampus, including the dentate gyrus, several layers will be shown. The dentate gyrus has three layers of cells. The layers are from the outer in – the &quot;molecular layer&quot;, the &quot;granular layer&quot;, and the &quot;polymorphic layer&quot; also known as the &quot;hilus&quot;. The CA3 subfield has the following cell layers known as strata: lacunosum-moleculare, radiatum, lucidum, pyramidal, and oriens. CA2 and CA1 also have these layers except the lucidum stratum.

The input to the hippocampus (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) comes from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures as well as with the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.

The EC is located in the parahippocampal gyrus, a cortical region adjacent to the hippocampus. This gyrus conceals the hippocampus. The parahippocampal gyrus is adjacent to the perirhinal cortex, which plays an important role in the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also substantial evidence that it makes a contribution to memory, which can be distinguished from the contribution of the hippocampus. It is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both the hippocampus and the parahippocampus are damaged.

===Circuitry===

The major input to the hippocampus is through the entorhinal cortex (EC), whereas its major output is via CA1 to the subiculum. Information reaches CA1 via two main pathways, direct and indirect. Axons from the EC that originate in layer III are the origin of the direct perforant pathway and form synapses on the very distal apical dendrites of CA1 neurons. Conversely, axons originating from layer II are the origin of the indirect pathway, and information reaches CA1 via the trisynaptic circuit. In the initial part of this pathway, the axons project through the perforant pathway to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus (first synapse). From then, the information follows via the mossy cell fibres to CA3 (second synapse). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1 (third synapse). Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex, completing the circuit.

Basket cells in CA3 receive excitatory input from the pyramidal cells and then give an inhibitory feedback to the pyramidal cells. This &quot;recurrent inhibition&quot; is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in the hippocampus. The pyramidal cells give a &quot;recurrent excitation&quot; which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.

Several other connections play important roles in hippocampal function. Beyond the output to the EC, additional output pathways go to other cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex. A major output goes via the fornix to the lateral septal area and to the mammillary body of the hypothalamus (which the fornix interconnects with the hippocampus). The hippocampus receives modulatory input from the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine systems, and from the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus to field CA1. A very important projection comes from the medial septal nucleus, which sends cholinergic, and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) stimulating fibers (GABAergic fibers) to all parts of the hippocampus. The inputs from the medial septal nucleus play a key role in controlling the physiological state of the hippocampus; destruction of this nucleus abolishes the hippocampal theta rhythm and severely impairs certain types of memory.

===Subfields===

Hippocampal subfields, and subregions, head, body, and tail, are functionally and anatomically differentiated, and connect differently to other brain regions. Their cells are morphologically different. They also have different levels of vulnerability to disease. 

In humans the head of the hippocampus is termed the anterior hippocampus, the body is the intermediate hippocampus, and the tail the posterior hippocampus. The subregions all serve different functions, project with different neural pathways, and have varying numbers of place cells. (In other primates the terms used are rostral and caudal, and in rodents they are termed ventral and dorsal). The posterior hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze in rats, lesions in the dorsal hippocampus were shown to cause spatial memory impairment. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus, and supramammillary nucleus. In the rat the dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.

The intermediate hippocampus has overlapping characteristics with both the ventral and dorsal hippocampus. Using anterograde tracing methods, Cenquizca and Swanson (2007) located the moderate projections to two primary olfactory cortical areas and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. This region has the smallest number of place cells. The ventral hippocampus functions in fear conditioning and affective processes. Anagnostaras &quot;et al.&quot; (2002) showed that alterations to the ventral hippocampus reduced the amount of information sent to the amygdala by the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, consequently altering fear conditioning in rats. Historically, the earliest widely held hypothesis was that the hippocampus is involved in olfaction. This idea was cast into doubt by a series of anatomical studies that did not find any direct projections to the hippocampus from the olfactory bulb. However, later work did confirm that the olfactory bulb does project into the ventral part of the lateral entorhinal cortex, and field CA1 in the ventral hippocampus sends axons to the main olfactory bulb, the anterior olfactory nucleus, and to the primary olfactory cortex. There continues to be some interest in hippocampal olfactory responses, in particular, the role of the hippocampus in memory for odors, but few specialists today believe that olfaction is its primary function.

== Function ==

===Theories===
Three main theories of hippocampal function have been in dominance: response inhibition, episodic memory, and spatial cognition. The response inhibition theory (caricatured by John O&#x27;Keefe and Lynn Nadel as &quot;slam on the brakes!&quot;) was very popular up to the 1960s. It was based largely on two observations: first, that animals with hippocampal damage tend to be hyperactive; second, that animals with hippocampal damage often have difficulty learning to inhibit previously learnt responses, especially if the response requires remaining quiet as in a passive avoidance test. British psychologist Jeffrey Gray developed this line of thought into a complete theory of the role of the hippocampus in anxiety, called the behavioral inhibition system.

The second major line of thought relates the hippocampus to memory. Although it had historical precursors, this idea derived its main impetus from a famous report by American neurosurgeon William Beecher Scoville and British-Canadian neuropsychologist Brenda Milner. It described the results of surgical destruction of the hippocampi when trying to relieve epileptic seizures in an American man Henry Molaison, known until his death in 2008 as &quot;Patient H.M.&quot; The unexpected outcome of the surgery was severe anterograde, and partial retrograde amnesia; Molaison was unable to form new episodic memories after his surgery and could not remember any events that occurred just before his surgery, but he did retain memories of events that occurred many years earlier extending back into his childhood. This case attracted such widespread professional interest that Molaison became the most intensively studied subject in medical history. In the ensuing years, other patients with similar levels of hippocampal damage and amnesia (caused by accident or disease) have also been studied, and thousands of experiments have studied the physiology of activity-driven changes in synaptic connections in the hippocampus. A later theory (2020) proposed – without questioning its role in spatial cognition – that the hippocampus encodes new episodic memories by associating representations in the newborn granule cells of the dentate gyrus and arranging those representations sequentially in CA3 by relying on the phase precession generated in the entorhinal cortex. 

The third important theory of hippocampal function relates the hippocampus to space, and spatial memory, with the idea of a cognitive map first proposed by American psychologist E.C. Tolman. This theory was followed further by O&#x27;Keefe, and in 1971, he and his student Dostrovsky discovered neurons, in the rat hippocampus that seemed to show activity related to the rat&#x27;s location within its environment. The neurons were described as place cells. A book was later produced in 1978, &quot;The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map&quot; written by O&#x27;Keefe and Nadel. It has been generally agreed that the hippocampus plays a key role in spatial coding but the details are widely debated.

Later research has focused on trying to bridge the disconnect between the two main views of hippocampal function as being split between memory and spatial cognition. In some studies, these areas have been expanded to the point of near convergence. In an attempt to reconcile the two disparate views, it is suggested that a broader view of the hippocampal function is taken and seen to have a role that encompasses both the organisation of experience (mental mapping, as per Tolman&#x27;s original concept in 1948) and the directional behaviour seen as being involved in all areas of cognition, so that the function of the hippocampus can be viewed as a broader system that incorporates both the memory and the spatial perspectives in its role that involves the use of a wide scope of cognitive maps. This relates to the purposive behaviorism born of Tolman&#x27;s original goal of identifying the complex cognitive mechanisms and purposes that guided behaviour. 

It has also been proposed that the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated spatially, and it was suggested that the mechanisms of memory and planning both evolved from mechanisms of navigation and that their neuronal algorithms were basically the same.

Many studies have made use of neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and a functional role in approach-avoidance conflict has been noted. The anterior hippocampus is seen to be involved in decision-making under approach-avoidance conflict processing. It is suggested that the memory, spatial cognition, and conflict processing functions may be seen as working together and not mutually exclusive.

=== Role in memory ===

The hippocampus is essential for the formation of explicit memory, also known as declarative memory. Episodic memory, and semantic memory are the two components of explicit memory.

The hippocampus also encodes emotional context from the amygdala. This is partly why returning to a location where an emotional event occurred may evoke that emotion. There is a deep emotional connection between episodic memories and places.

Due to bilateral symmetry the brain has a hippocampus in each cerebral hemisphere. If damage to the hippocampus occurs in only one hemisphere, leaving the structure intact in the other hemisphere, the brain can retain near-normal memory functioning. Severe damage to the hippocampi in both hemispheres results in profound difficulties in forming new memories (anterograde amnesia) and often also affects memories formed before the damage occurred (retrograde amnesia). Although the retrograde effect normally extends many years back before the brain damage, in some cases older memories remain. This retention of older memories leads to the idea that consolidation over time involves the transfer of memories out of the hippocampus to other parts of the brain. Experiments using intrahippocampal transplantation of hippocampal cells in primates with neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus have shown that the hippocampus is required for the formation and recall, but not the storage, of memories. It has been shown that a decrease in the volume of various parts of the hippocampus leads to specific memory impairments. In particular, efficiency of verbal memory retention is related to the anterior parts of the right and left hippocampus. The right head of the hippocampus is more involved in executive functions and regulation during verbal memory recall. The tail of the left hippocampus tends to be closely related to verbal memory capacity.

Damage to the hippocampus does not affect some types of memory, such as the ability to learn new skills (playing a musical instrument or solving certain types of puzzles, for example). This fact suggests that such abilities depend on different types of memory such as procedural memory in implicit memory function, implicating different brain regions. Furthermore, amnesic patients frequently show implicit memory for experiences even in the absence of conscious knowledge. For example, patients asked to guess which of two faces they have seen most recently may give the correct answer most of the time in spite of stating that they have never seen either of the faces before. Some researchers distinguish between conscious &quot;recollection&quot;, which depends on the hippocampus, and &quot;familiarity&quot;, which depends on portions of the medial temporal lobe. A study claims to have confirmed that the hippocampus is not associated with implicit memory. But other sources say the question is still up for debate (as of 2024).

When rats are exposed to an intense learning event, they may retain a life-long memory of the event even after a single training session. The memory of such an event appears to be first stored in the hippocampus, but this storage is transient. Much of the long-term storage of the memory seems to take place in the anterior cingulate cortex. When such an intense learning event was experimentally applied, more than 5,000 differently methylated DNA regions appeared in the hippocampus neuronal genome of the rats at one hour and at 24 hours after training. These alterations in methylation pattern occurred at many genes that were down-regulated, often due to the formation of new 5-methylcytosine sites in CpG rich regions of the genome. Furthermore, many other genes were upregulated, likely often due to the removal of methyl groups from previously existing 5-methylcytosines (5mCs) in DNA. Demethylation of 5mC can be carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including TET enzymes as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway.

====Between systems model====
The between-systems memory interference model describes the inhibition of non-hippocampal systems of memory during concurrent hippocampal activity. Specifically it was found that when the hippocampus was inactive, non-hippocampal systems located elsewhere in the brain were found to consolidate memory in its place. However, when the hippocampus was reactivated, memory traces consolidated by non-hippocampal systems were not recalled, suggesting that the hippocampus interferes with long-term memory consolidation in other memory-related systems. 

One of the major implications that this model illustrates is the dominant effects of the hippocampus on non-hippocampal networks when information is incongruent. With this information in mind, future directions could lead towards the study of these non-hippocampal memory systems through hippocampal inactivation, further expanding the labile constructs of memory. Additionally, many theories of memory are holistically based around the hippocampus. This model could add beneficial information to hippocampal research and memory theories such as the multiple trace theory. Lastly, the between-system memory interference model allows researchers to evaluate their results on a multiple-systems model, suggesting that some effects may not be simply mediated by one portion of the brain.

=== Role in spatial memory and navigation ===

There are several types of navigational cells in the brain that are either in the hippocampus itself or are strongly connected to it. They include the place cells, speed cells present in the medial entorhinal cortex, head direction cells, grid cells, and boundary cells. Together these cells form a network that serves as spatial memory. 

The first of these types of cell discovered in the 1970s were the place cells, which led to the idea of the hippocampus acting to give a neural representation of the environment in a cognitive map. When the hippocampus is dysfunctional, orientation is affected; people may have difficulty in remembering how they arrived at a location and how to proceed further. Getting lost is a common symptom of amnesia. Studies with animals have shown that an intact hippocampus is required for initial learning and long-term retention of some spatial memory tasks, in particular ones that require finding the way to a hidden goal.

Studies on freely moving rats and mice have shown many hippocampal neurons to act as place cells that cluster in place fields, and these fire bursts of action potentials when the animal passes through a particular location.
Hippocampal place cells interact extensively with head direction cells, whose activity acts as an inertial compass, and conjecturally with grid cells in the neighboring entorhinal cortex. Speed cells are thought to provide input to the hippocampal grid cells. This place-related neural activity in the hippocampus has also been reported in monkeys that were moved around a room whilst in a restraint chair. However, the place cells may have fired in relation to where the monkey was looking rather than to its actual location in the room. Over many years, many studies have been carried out on place-responses in rodents, which have given a large amount of information. Place cell responses are shown by pyramidal cells in the hippocampus and by granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Other cells in smaller proportion are inhibitory interneurons, and these often show place-related variations in their firing rate that are much weaker. There is little, if any, spatial topography in the representation; in general, cells lying next to each other in the hippocampus have uncorrelated spatial firing patterns. Place cells are typically almost silent when a rat is moving around outside the place field but reach sustained rates as high as 40 Hz when the rat is near the center. Neural activity sampled from 30 to 40 randomly chosen place cells carries enough information to allow a rat&#x27;s location to be reconstructed with high confidence. The size of place fields varies in a gradient along the length of the hippocampus, with cells at the dorsal end showing the smallest fields, cells near the center showing larger fields, and cells at the ventral tip showing fields that cover the entire environment. In some cases, the firing rate of hippocampal cells depends not only on place but also the direction a rat is moving, the destination toward which it is traveling, or other task-related variables. The firing of place cells is timed in relation to local theta waves, a spatiotemporal process termed phase precession.

Cells with location-specific firing patterns have been reported during a study of people with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize the source of their seizures, with a view to surgical resection. They had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampi and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London&#x27;s black cab drivers need to learn the locations of a large number of places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions. Another study showed opposite findings in blind individuals. The anterior part of the right hippocampus was larger and the posterior part was smaller, compared with sighted individuals.

===Role in approach-avoidance conflict processing===

Approach-avoidance conflict happens when a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making has been associated with anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision-making in uncertain conditions.

A review makes reference to a number of studies that show the involvement of the hippocampus in conflict tasks. The authors suggest that one challenge is to understand how conflict processing relates to the functions of spatial navigation and memory and how all of these functions need not be mutually exclusive.

===Role in social memory===

The hippocampus has received renewed attention for its role in social memory. Epileptic human subjects with depth electrodes in the left posterior, left anterior or right anterior hippocampus demonstrate distinct, individual cell responses when presented with faces of presumably recognizable famous people. Associations among facial and vocal identity were similarly mapped to the hippocampus of rheseus monkeys. Single neurons in the CA1 and CA3 responded strongly to social stimulus recognition by MRI. The CA2 was not distinguished, and may likely comprise a proportion of the claimed CA1 cells in the study. The dorsal CA2 and ventral CA1 subregions of the hippocampus have been implicated in social memory processing. Genetic inactivation of CA2 pyramidal neurons leads to pronounced loss of social memory, while maintaining intact sociability in mice. Similarly, ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons have also been demonstrated as critical for social memory under optogenetic control in mice.

== Physiology ==
The hippocampus shows two major modes of activity, each associated with a distinct pattern of neural population activity and waves of electrical activity as measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG). These modes are named after the EEG patterns associated with them: theta and large irregular activity (LIA). The main characteristics described below are for the rat, which is the animal most extensively studied.

The theta mode appears during states of active, alert behavior (especially locomotion), and also during REM sleep (dreaming). In the theta mode, the EEG is dominated by large regular waves with a frequency range of 6 to 9 Hz, and the main groups of hippocampal neurons (pyramidal cells and granule cells) show sparse population activity, which means that in any short time interval, the great majority of cells are silent, while the small remaining fraction fire at relatively high rates, up to 50 spikes in one second for the most active of them. An active cell typically stays active for half a second to a few seconds. As the rat behaves, the active cells fall silent and new cells become active, but the overall percentage of active cells remains more or less constant. In many situations, cell activity is determined largely by the spatial location of the animal, but other behavioral variables also clearly influence it.

The LIA mode appears during slow-wave sleep (non-dreaming), and also during states of waking immobility such as resting or eating. In the LIA mode, the EEG is dominated by sharp waves that are randomly timed large deflections of the EEG signal lasting for 25–50 milliseconds. Sharp waves are frequently generated in sets, with sets containing up to 5 or more individual sharp waves and lasting up to 500 ms. The spiking activity of neurons within the hippocampus is highly correlated with sharp wave activity. Most neurons decrease their firing rate between sharp waves; however, during a sharp wave, there is a dramatic increase in firing rate in up to 10% of the hippocampal population.

These two hippocampal activity modes can be seen in primates as well as rats, with the exception that it has been difficult to see robust theta rhythmicity in the primate hippocampus. There are, however, qualitatively similar sharp waves and similar state-dependent changes in neural population activity.

=== Theta rhythm ===
The underlying currents producing the theta wave are generated mainly by densely packed neural layers of the entorhinal cortex, CA3, and the dendrites of pyramidal cells. The theta wave is one of the largest signals seen on EEG, and is known as the &quot;hippocampal theta rhythm&quot;. In some situations the EEG is dominated by regular waves at 3 to 10 Hz, often continuing for many seconds. These reflect subthreshold membrane potentials and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal neurons and synchronise across the hippocampus in a travelling wave pattern. The trisynaptic circuit is a relay of neurotransmission in the hippocampus that interacts with many brain regions. From rodent studies it has been proposed that the trisynaptic circuit generates the hippocampal theta rhythm.

Theta rhythmicity is very obvious in rabbits and rodents and also clearly present in cats and dogs. Whether theta can be seen in primates is not yet clear. In rats (the animals that have been the most extensively studied), theta is seen mainly in two conditions: first, when an animal is walking or in some other way actively interacting with its surroundings; second, during REM sleep. The function of theta has not yet been convincingly explained although numerous theories have been proposed. The most popular hypothesis has been to relate it to learning and memory. An example would be the phase with which theta rhythms, at the time of stimulation of a neuron, shape the effect of that stimulation upon its synapses. What is meant here is that theta rhythms may affect those aspects of learning and memory that are dependent upon synaptic plasticity. It is well established that lesions of the medial septumthe central node of the theta systemcause severe disruptions of memory. However, the medial septum is more than just the controller of theta; it is also the main source of cholinergic projections to the hippocampus. It has not been established that septal lesions exert their effects specifically by eliminating the theta rhythm.

=== Sharp waves ===
During sleep or during resting, when an animal is not engaged with its surroundings, the hippocampal EEG shows a pattern of irregular slow waves, somewhat larger in amplitude than theta waves. This pattern is occasionally interrupted by large surges called &quot;sharp waves&quot;. These events are associated with bursts of spike activity lasting 50 to 100 milliseconds in pyramidal cells of CA3 and CA1. They are also associated with short-lived high-frequency EEG oscillations called &quot;ripples&quot;, with frequencies in the range 150 to 200 Hz in rats, and together they are known as sharp waves and ripples. Sharp waves are most frequent during sleep when they occur at an average rate of around 1 per second (in rats) but in a very irregular temporal pattern. Sharp waves are less frequent during inactive waking states and are usually smaller. Sharp waves have also been observed in humans and monkeys. In macaques, sharp waves are robust but do not occur as frequently as in rats.

Sharp waves appear to be associated with memory. Numerous later studies, have reported that when hippocampal place cells have overlapping spatial firing fields (and therefore often fire in near-simultaneity), they tend to show correlated activity during sleep following the behavioral session. This enhancement of correlation, commonly known as &quot;reactivation&quot;, has been found to occur mainly during sharp waves. It has been proposed that sharp waves are, in fact, reactivations of neural activity patterns that were memorized during behavior, driven by strengthening of synaptic connections within the hippocampus. This idea forms a key component of the &quot;two-stage memory&quot; theory, advocated by Buzsáki and others, which proposes that memories are stored within the hippocampus during behavior and then later transferred to the neocortex during sleep. Sharp waves in Hebbian theory are seen as persistently repeated stimulations by presynaptic cells, of postsynaptic cells that are suggested to drive synaptic changes in the cortical targets of hippocampal output pathways. Suppression of sharp waves and ripples in sleep or during immobility can interfere with memories expressed at the level of the behavior, nonetheless, the newly formed CA1 place cell code can re-emerge even after a sleep with abolished sharp waves and ripples, in spatially non-demanding tasks.

=== Long-term potentiation ===
Since at least the time of Ramon y Cajal (1852–1934), psychologists have speculated that the brain stores memory by altering the strength of connections between neurons that are simultaneously active. This idea was formalized by Donald Hebb in 1949, but for many years remained unexplained. In 1973, Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo described a phenomenon in the rabbit hippocampus that appeared to meet Hebb&#x27;s specifications: a change in synaptic responsiveness induced by brief strong activation and lasting for hours or days or longer. This phenomenon was soon referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP). As a candidate mechanism for long-term memory, LTP has since been studied intensively, and a great deal has been learned about it. However, the complexity and variety of the intracellular signalling cascades that can trigger LTP is acknowledged as preventing a more complete understanding.

The hippocampus is a particularly favorable site for studying LTP because of its densely packed and sharply defined layers of neurons, but similar types of activity-dependent synaptic change have also been observed in many other brain areas. The best-studied form of LTP has been seen in CA1 of the hippocampus and occurs at synapses that terminate on dendritic spines and use the neurotransmitter glutamate. The synaptic changes depend on a special type of glutamate receptor, the &quot;N&quot;-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a cell surface receptor which has the special property of allowing calcium to enter the postsynaptic spine only when presynaptic activation and postsynaptic depolarization occur at the same time. Drugs that interfere with NMDA receptors block LTP and have major effects on some types of memory, especially spatial memory. Genetically modified mice that are modified to disable the LTP mechanism, also generally show severe memory deficits.

==Clinical significance==

===Aging===
Normal aging is associated with a gradual decline in some types of memory, including episodic memory and working memory (or short-term memory). Because the hippocampus is thought to play a central role in memory, there has been considerable interest in the possibility that age-related declines could be caused by hippocampal deterioration. Some early studies reported substantial loss of neurons in the hippocampus of elderly people, but later studies using more precise techniques found only minimal differences. Similarly, some MRI studies have reported shrinkage of the hippocampus in elderly people, but other studies have failed to reproduce this finding. There is, however, a reliable relationship between the size of the hippocampus and memory performance; so that where there is age-related shrinkage, memory performance will be impaired. There are also reports that memory tasks tend to produce less hippocampal activation in the elderly than in the young. Furthermore, a randomized control trial published in 2011 found that aerobic exercise could increase the size of the hippocampus in adults aged 55 to 80 and also improve spatial memory.

===Dementia===
In Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (and other forms of dementia), the hippocampus is one of the first regions of the brain to suffer damage;
short-term memory loss and disorientation are included among the early symptoms. Damage to the hippocampus can also result from oxygen starvation (hypoxia), encephalitis, or medial temporal lobe epilepsy. People with extensive, bilateral hippocampal damage may experience anterograde amnesia: the inability to form and retain new memories.
Dementia, is very often caused by cerebral ischemia, that is believed to trigger changes in the hippocampus. Changes in CA1, the hippocampal area that underlies episodic memory, cause episodic memory impairment, the earliest symptom of post-ischemic dementia.

===Stress===
The hippocampus contains high levels of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of other parts of the brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. Anterior hippocampal volume in children is positively correlated with parental family income and this correlation is thought to be mediated by income related stress. A study has revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.

Chronic stress resulting in elevated levels of glucocorticoids, notably of cortisol, is seen to be a cause of neuronal atrophy in the hippocampus. This atrophy results in a smaller hippocampal volume which is also seen in Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. The higher levels of cortisol in Cushing&#x27;s syndrome is usually the result of medications taken for other conditions. Neuronal loss also occurs as a result of impaired neurogenesis. Another factor that contributes to a smaller hippocampal volume is that of dendritic retraction where dendrites are shortened in length and reduced in number, in response to increased glucocorticoids. This dendritic retraction is reversible. After treatment with medication to reduce cortisol in Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, the hippocampal volume is seen to be restored by as much as 10%. This change is seen to be due to the reforming of the dendrites. This dendritic restoration can also happen when stress is removed. There is, however, evidence derived mainly from studies using rats that stress occurring shortly after birth can affect hippocampal function in ways that persist throughout life.

Sex-specific responses to stress have also been demonstrated in the rat to have an effect on the hippocampus. Chronic stress in the male rat showed dendritic retraction and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female. This was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones. In rats, DNA damage increases in the hippocampus under conditions of stress.

===Epilepsy===
The hippocampus is one of the few brain regions where new neurons are generated. This process of neurogenesis is confined to the dentate gyrus. Neurogenesis can be positively affected by exercise or negatively affected by epileptic seizures.

Seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy can affect the normal development of new neurons and can cause tissue damage. Hippocampal sclerosis specific to the mesial temporal lobe, is the most common type of such tissue damage. It is not yet clear, however, whether the epilepsy is usually caused by hippocampal abnormalities or whether the hippocampus is damaged by cumulative effects of seizures. However, in experimental settings where repetitive seizures are artificially induced in animals, hippocampal damage is a frequent result. This may be a consequence of the concentration of excitable glutamate receptors in the hippocampus. Hyperexcitability can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death. It may also have something to do with the hippocampus being a site where new neurons continue to be created throughout life, and to abnormalities in this process.

===Schizophrenia===
The causes of schizophrenia are not well understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the hippocampus have also been described. Many reports have found reductions in the size of the hippocampus in people with schizophrenia. The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result of abnormal development. Some studies in humans suggest that hippocampal alterations play a role in causing psychotic symptoms that are the most important feature of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the basal ganglia, thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.

MRI studies have found a smaller brain volume and larger ventricles in people with schizophreniahowever researchers do not know if the shrinkage is from the schizophrenia or from the medication. The hippocampus and thalamus have been shown to be reduced in volume; and the volume of the globus pallidus is increased. Cortical patterns are altered, and a reduction in the volume and thickness of the cortex particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes has been noted. It has further been proposed that many of the changes seen are present at the start of the disorder which gives weight to the theory that there is abnormal neurodevelopment.

The hippocampus has been seen as central to the pathology of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder. Oxidative DNA damage is substantially increased in the hippocampus of elderly patients with chronic schizophrenia.

===Transient global amnesia===

Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, sudden, temporary, near-total loss of short-term memory. Various causes have been hypothesized including ischemia, epilepsy, migraine and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow, leading to ischemia of structures such as the hippocampus that are involved in memory.

There has been no scientific proof of any cause. However, diffusion-weighted MRI studies taken from 12 to 24 hours following an episode has shown there to be small dot-like lesions in the hippocampus. These findings have suggested a possible implication of CA1 neurons made vulnerable by metabolic stress.

===PTSD===

Some studies shows correlation of reduced hippocampus volume and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans with no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in those with chronic PTSD, traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). It is also the case that non-combat twin brothers of Vietnam veterans with PTSD also had smaller hippocampi than other controls, raising questions about the nature of the correlation. A 2016 study strengthened the theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus increases the likelihood of efficacious treatment.

=== Microcephaly ===

Hippocampus atrophy has been characterized in those with microcephaly. Mouse models with Wdr62 mutations which recapitulate human point mutations show a deficiency in hippocampal development, and neurogenesis.

==Other animals==
===Other mammals===
The hippocampus has a generally similar appearance across the range of mammals, from egg-laying mammals such as the echidna, to humans and other primates. The hippocampal-size-to-body-size ratio broadly increases, being about twice as large for primates as for the echidna. It does not, however, increase at anywhere close to the rate of the neocortex-to-body-size ratio. Therefore, the hippocampus takes up a much larger fraction of the cortical mantle in rodents than in primates. In adult humans the volume of the hippocampus on each side of the brain is about 3.0 to 3.5 cm3 as compared to 320 to 420 cm3 for the volume of the neocortex.

There is also a general relationship between the size of the hippocampus and spatial memory. When comparisons are made between similar species, those that have a greater capacity for spatial memory tend to have larger hippocampal volumes. This relationship also extends to sex differences; in species where males and females show strong differences in spatial memory ability they also tend to show corresponding differences in hippocampal volume.

===Other vertebrates===
Non-mammalian species do not have a brain structure that looks like the mammalian hippocampus, but they have one that is considered homologous to it. The hippocampus, as pointed out above, is in essence part of the allocortex. Only mammals have a fully developed cortex, but the structure it evolved from, called the pallium, is present in all vertebrates, even the most primitive ones such as the lamprey or hagfish. The pallium is usually divided into three zones: medial, lateral and dorsal. The medial pallium forms the precursor of the hippocampus. It does not resemble the hippocampus visually because the layers are not warped into an S shape or enfolded by the dentate gyrus, but the homology is indicated by strong chemical and functional affinities. There is now evidence that these hippocampal-like structures are involved in spatial cognition in reptiles, and fish.

====Birds====

In birds, the correspondence is sufficiently well established that most anatomists refer to the medial pallial zone as the &quot;avian hippocampus&quot;. Numerous species of birds have strong spatial skills, in particular those that cache (store) food. There is evidence that food-caching birds have a larger hippocampus than other types of birds and that damage to the hippocampus causes impairments in spatial memory.

====Fish====
The story for fish is more complex. In teleost fish (which make up the great majority of existing species), the forebrain is distorted in comparison to other types of vertebrates: most neuroanatomists believe that the teleost forebrain is in essence everted, like a sock turned inside-out, so that structures that lie in the interior, next to the ventricles, for most vertebrates, are found on the outside in teleost fish, and vice versa. One of the consequences of this is that the medial pallium (&quot;hippocampal&quot; zone) of a typical vertebrate is thought to correspond to the lateral pallium of a typical fish. Several types of fish (particularly goldfish) have been shown experimentally to have strong spatial memory abilities, even forming &quot;cognitive maps&quot; of the areas they inhabit. There is evidence that damage to the lateral pallium impairs spatial memory. It is not yet known whether the medial pallium plays a similar role in even more primitive vertebrates, such as sharks and rays, or even lampreys and hagfish.

===Insects and molluscs===
Some types of insects such as cockroaches, and molluscs such as the octopus, also have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities, but these appear to work differently from the mammalian spatial system, suggesting that there is no common evolutionary origin. Mushroom bodies in insect brains are associated with learning and memory carried out in the mammalian hippocampus. The brain of the octopus is arranged in a circle of lobes around the esophagus. The vertical lobe has been shown to be involved in forming long term memory, and is seen to be analogous to the mammalian hippocampus and cerebellum, and also to share some functional features of the mushroom bodies in insects.

<doc id="53949" wikidata="Q358813" url="?curid=53949" title="Black-and-white colobus">
<text>Black-and-white colobuses (or colobi) are Old World monkeys of the genus Colobus, native to Africa. They are closely related to the red colobus monkeys of genus &quot;Piliocolobus&quot;. There are five species of this monkey, and at least eight subspecies. They are generally found in high-density forests where they forage on leaves, flowers and fruit. Social groups of colobus are diverse, varying from group to group. Resident-egalitarian and allomothering relationships have been observed among the female population. Complex behaviours have also been observed in this species, including greeting rituals and varying group sleeping patterns. Colobi play a significant role in seed dispersal.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;colobus&quot; comes from the Greek (&quot;kolobós&quot;, &quot;docked&quot;, &quot;maimed&quot;) and refers to the stump-like thumb.

==Taxonomy==


Fossil species
*†&quot;Colobus flandrini&quot;
*†&quot;Colobus freedmani&quot;

==Behaviour and ecology==

Colobus habitats include primary and secondary forests, riverine forests, and wooded grasslands; they are found more in higher-density logged forests than in other primary forests. Their ruminant-like digestive systems have enabled them to occupy niches that are inaccessible to other primates: they are herbivorous, eating leaves, fruit, flowers, lichen, herbaceous vegetation and bark. Colobuses are important for seed dispersal through their sloppy eating habits, as well as through their digestive systems.

Leaf toughness influences colobus foraging efficiency. Tougher leaves correlate negatively with ingestion rate (g/min) as they are costly in terms of mastication, but positively with investment (chews/g). Individuals spend approximately 150 minutes actively feeding each day. In a montane habitat colobus are known to utilise lichen as a fallback food during periods of low food availability.

===Social patterns and morphology===
Colobuses live in territorial groups that vary in both size (3-15 individuals) and structure. It was originally believed that the structure of these groups consisted of one male and about 8 female members. However, more recent observations have shown variation in structure and the number of males within groups, with one species forming multi-male, multifemale groups in a multilevel society, and in some populations supergroups form exceeding 500 individuals. There appears to be a dominant male, whilst there is no clear dominance among female members. Relationships among females are considered to be resident-egalitarian, as there is low competition and aggression between them within their own groups. Juveniles are treated as a lower-rank (in regards to authority) than subadults and likewise when comparing subadults to adults. Colobuses do not display any type of seasonal breeding patterns.

As suggested by their name, adult colobi have black fur with white features. White fur surrounds their facial region and a &quot;U&quot; shape of long white fur runs along the sides of their body. Newborn colobi are completely white with a pink face. Cases of allomothering are documented, which means members of the troop other than the infant&#x27;s biological mother care for it. Allomothering is believed to increase inclusive fitness or maternal practice for the benefit of future offspring.

=== Social behaviours ===

Many members participate in a greeting ritual when they are reunited with familiar individuals, an act of reaffirming. The greeting behaviour is generally carried out by the approaching monkey and often is followed with grooming. They participate in three greeting behaviours of physical contact. This includes mounting, head mounting (grasps the shoulders) and embracing. It seems as though these behaviours do not have any relationship with mating or courting.Black-and-white colobus have complex sleeping patterns. They sleep in trees near a food source, which may serve to save energy. Groups seem to regularly switch up sleeping locations (suggested due to reducing risk of parasites and placement prediction) and generally do not sleep near other groups. They also tend to sleep more tightly together on nights with great visibility. They sleep in mid- to upper sections of tall trees which allows for predator watch as well as protection from ground and aerial predators while they are asleep. Although there is no obvious preference for tree type, they have often been observed in &quot;Antiaris toxicaria.&quot;

==Conservation==
They are prey for many forest predators such as leopards and chimpanzees, and are threatened by hunting for the bushmeat trade, logging, and habitat destruction.

Individuals are more vigilant (conspecific threat) in low canopy, they also spend less time scanning when they are around familiar group members as opposed to unfamiliar. There are no clear difference in vigilance between male and females. However, there is a positive correlation between mean monthly vigilance and encounter rates. Male vigilance generally increases during mating.

<doc id="53951" wikidata="Q40878" url="?curid=53951" title="Diarrhea">
<text>Diarrhea (American English), also spelled diarrhoea or diarrhœa (British English), is the condition of having at least three loose, liquid, or watery bowel movements in a day. It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss. Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour. This can progress to decreased urination, loss of skin color, a fast heart rate, and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe. Loose but non-watery stools in babies who are exclusively breastfed, however, are normal.

The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to a virus, bacterium, or parasite—a condition also known as gastroenteritis. These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by feces, or directly from another person who is infected. The three types of diarrhea are: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (lasting more than two weeks, which can be either watery or bloody). The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to cholera, although this is rare in the developed world. If blood is present, it is also known as dysentery. A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea. These include lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis, hyperthyroidism, bile acid diarrhea, and a number of medications. In most cases, stool cultures to confirm the exact cause are not required.

Diarrhea can be prevented by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing with soap. Breastfeeding for at least six months and vaccination against rotavirus is also recommended. Oral rehydration solution (ORS)—clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar—is the treatment of choice. Zinc tablets are also recommended. These treatments have been estimated to have saved 50 million children in the past 25 years. When people have diarrhea it is recommended that they continue to eat healthy food, and babies continue to be breastfed. If commercial ORS is not available, homemade solutions may be used. In those with severe dehydration, intravenous fluids may be required. Most cases, however, can be managed well with fluids by mouth. Antibiotics, while rarely used, may be recommended in a few cases such as those who have bloody diarrhea and a high fever, those with severe diarrhea following travelling, and those who grow specific bacteria or parasites in their stool. Loperamide may help decrease the number of bowel movements but is not recommended in those with severe disease.

About 1.7 to 5 billion cases of diarrhea occur per year. It is most common in developing countries, where young children get diarrhea on average three times a year. Total deaths from diarrhea are estimated at 1.53 million in 2019—down from 2.9 million in 1990. In 2012, it was the second most common cause of deaths in children younger than five (0.76 million or 11%). Frequent episodes of diarrhea are also a common cause of malnutrition and the most common cause in those younger than five years of age. Other long term problems that can result include stunted growth and poor intellectual development.

== Terminology ==

The word diarrhea is from the Ancient Greek from &#x27; &quot;through&quot; and &#x27; &quot;flow&quot;.

&quot;Diarrhea&quot; is the spelling in American English, whereas &quot;diarrhoea&quot; is the spelling in British English.

Slang terms for the condition include &quot;the runs&quot;, &quot;the squirts&quot; (or &quot;squits&quot; in Britain) and &quot;the trots&quot;.
The word is often pronounced as .

== Definition ==
Diarrhea is defined by the World Health Organization as having three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or as having more stools than is normal for that person.

Acute diarrhea is defined as an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or fluid fecal matter from the bowel, lasting less than 14 days, by World Gastroenterology Organization. Acute diarrhea that is watery may be known as AWD (Acute Watery Diarrhoea.)

===Secretory===
Secretory diarrhea means that there is an increase in the active secretion, or there is an inhibition of absorption. There is little to no structural damage. The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a cholera toxin that stimulates the secretion of anions, especially chloride ions (Cl–). Therefore, to maintain a charge balance in the gastrointestinal tract, sodium (Na+) is carried with it, along with water. In this type of diarrhea intestinal fluid secretion is isotonic with plasma even during fasting. It continues even when there is no oral food intake.

===Osmotic===
Osmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels. If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt, these can draw water from the body into the bowel and cause osmotic diarrhea. Osmotic diarrhea can also result from maldigestion (e.g., pancreatic disease or coeliac disease) in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium, vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have fructose malabsorption, excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent (e.g., milk or sorbitol) is stopped.

===Exudative===
Exudative diarrhea occurs with the presence of blood and pus in the stool. This occurs with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn&#x27;s disease or ulcerative colitis, and other severe infections such as &quot;E. coli&quot; or other forms of food poisoning.

===Inflammatory===
Inflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border, which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids. Features of all three of the other types of diarrhea can be found in this type of diarrhea. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases. It can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis.

===Dysentery===
If there is blood visible in the stools, it is also known as dysentery. The blood is a trace of an invasion of bowel tissue. Dysentery is a symptom of, among others, &quot;Shigella&quot;, &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella&quot;.

==Health effects==

Diarrheal disease may have a negative impact on both physical fitness and mental development. &quot;Early childhood malnutrition resulting from any cause reduces physical fitness and work productivity in adults&quot;, and diarrhea is a primary cause of childhood malnutrition. Further, evidence suggests that diarrheal disease has significant impacts on mental development and health; it has been shown that, even when controlling for helminth infection and early breastfeeding, children who had experienced severe diarrhea had significantly lower scores on a series of tests of intelligence.

Diarrhea can cause electrolyte imbalances, kidney impairment, dehydration, and defective immune system responses. When oral drugs are administered, the efficiency of the drug is to produce a therapeutic effect and the lack of this effect may be due to the medication travelling too quickly through the digestive system, limiting the time that it can be absorbed. Clinicians try to treat the diarrheas by reducing the dosage of medication, changing the dosing schedule, discontinuation of the drug, and rehydration. The interventions to control the diarrhea are not often effective. Diarrhea can have a profound effect on the quality of life because fecal incontinence is one of the leading factors for placing older adults in long term care facilities (nursing homes).
==Causes==
In the latter stages of human digestion, ingested materials are inundated with water and digestive fluids such as gastric acid, bile, and digestive enzymes in order to break them down into their nutrient components, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream via the intestinal tract in the small intestine. Prior to defecation, the large intestine reabsorbs the water and other digestive solvents in the waste product in order to maintain proper hydration and overall equilibrium. Diarrhea occurs when the large intestine is prevented, for any number of reasons, from sufficiently absorbing the water or other digestive fluids from fecal matter, resulting in a liquid, or &quot;loose&quot;, bowel movement.

Acute diarrhea is most commonly due to viral gastroenteritis with rotavirus, which accounts for 40% of cases in children under five. In travelers, however, bacterial infections predominate. Various toxins such as mushroom poisoning and drugs can also cause acute diarrhea.

Chronic diarrhea can be the part of the presentations of a number of chronic medical conditions affecting the intestine. Common causes include ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and bile acid malabsorption.

===Infections===
There are many causes of infectious diarrhea, which include viruses, bacteria and parasites. Infectious diarrhea is frequently referred to as gastroenteritis. Norovirus is the most common cause of viral diarrhea in adults, but rotavirus is the most common cause in children under five years old. Adenovirus types 40 and 41, and astroviruses cause a significant number of infections. Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli, such as E coli o157:h7, are the most common cause of infectious bloody diarrhea in the United States.

&quot;Campylobacter&quot; spp. are a common cause of bacterial diarrhea, but infections by &quot;Salmonella&quot; spp., &quot;Shigella&quot; spp. and some strains of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; are also a frequent cause.

In the elderly, particularly those who have been treated with antibiotics for unrelated infections, a toxin produced by &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; often causes severe diarrhea.

Parasites, particularly protozoa e.g., &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; spp., &quot;Giardia&quot; spp., &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, &quot;Blastocystis&quot; spp., &quot;Cyclospora cayetanensis&quot;, are frequently the cause of diarrhea that involves chronic infection. The broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent nitazoxanide has shown efficacy against many diarrhea-causing parasites.

Other infectious agents, such as parasites or bacterial toxins, may exacerbate symptoms. In sanitary living conditions where there is ample food and a supply of clean water, an otherwise healthy person usually recovers from viral infections in a few days. However, for ill or malnourished individuals, diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration and can become life-threatening.

====Sanitation====

Open defecation is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea leading to death.

Poverty is a good indicator of the rate of infectious diarrhea in a population. This association does not stem from poverty itself, but rather from the conditions under which impoverished people live. The absence of certain resources compromises the ability of the poor to defend themselves against infectious diarrhea. &quot;Poverty is associated with poor housing, crowding, dirt floors, lack of access to clean water or to sanitary disposal of fecal waste (sanitation), cohabitation with domestic animals that may carry human pathogens, and a lack of refrigerated storage for food, all of which increase the frequency of diarrhea... Poverty also restricts the ability to provide age-appropriate, nutritionally balanced diets or to modify diets when diarrhea develops so as to mitigate and repair nutrient losses. The impact is exacerbated by the lack of adequate, available, and affordable medical care.&quot;

One of the most common causes of infectious diarrhea is a lack of clean water. Often, improper fecal disposal leads to contamination of groundwater. This can lead to widespread infection among a population, especially in the absence of water filtration or purification. Human feces contains a variety of potentially harmful human pathogens.

====Nutrition====
Proper nutrition is important for health and functioning, including the prevention of infectious diarrhea. It is especially important to young children who do not have a fully developed immune system. Zinc deficiency, a condition often found in children in developing countries can, even in mild cases, have a significant impact on the development and proper functioning of the human immune system. Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency and reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever. Similarly, vitamin A deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes. However, there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status, others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency. Given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient, this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction.

===Malabsorption===

Malabsorption is the inability to absorb food fully, mostly from disorders in the small bowel, but also due to maldigestion from diseases of the pancreas.

Causes include:
* &quot;enzyme deficiencies or mucosal abnormality&quot;, as in food allergy and food intolerance, e.g. celiac disease (gluten intolerance), lactose intolerance (intolerance to milk sugar, common in non-Europeans), and fructose malabsorption.
* &quot;pernicious anemia&quot;, or impaired bowel function due to the inability to absorb vitamin B12,
* &quot;loss of pancreatic secretions&quot;, which may be due to cystic fibrosis or pancreatitis,
* &quot;structural defects&quot;, like short bowel syndrome (surgically removed bowel) and radiation fibrosis, such as usually follows cancer treatment and other drugs, including agents used in chemotherapy; and
* &quot;certain drugs&quot;, like orlistat, which inhibits the absorption of fat.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===

The two overlapping types here are of unknown origin:
* Ulcerative colitis is marked by chronic bloody diarrhea and inflammation mostly affects the distal colon near the rectum.
* Crohn&#x27;s disease typically affects fairly well demarcated segments of bowel in the colon and often affects the end of the small bowel.

===Irritable bowel syndrome===

Another possible cause of diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool (diarrhea or constipation) for at least three days a week over the previous three months. Symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS can be managed through a combination of dietary changes, soluble fiber supplements and medications such as loperamide or codeine. About 30% of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS have bile acid malabsorption diagnosed with an abnormal SeHCAT test.

===Other diseases===
Diarrhea can be caused by other diseases and conditions, namely:
* Chronic ethanol ingestion
* Hyperthyroidism
* Certain medications
* Bile acid malabsorption
* Ischemic bowel disease: This usually affects older people and can be due to blocked arteries.
* Microscopic colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease where changes are seen only on histological examination of colonic biopsies.
* Bile salt malabsorption (primary bile acid diarrhea) where excessive bile acids in the colon produce a secretory diarrhea.
* Hormone-secreting tumors: some hormones, e.g. serotonin, can cause diarrhea if secreted in excess (usually from a tumor).
* Chronic mild diarrhea in infants and toddlers may occur with no obvious cause and with no other ill effects; this condition is called toddler&#x27;s diarrhea.
* Environmental enteropathy
* Radiation enteropathy following treatment for pelvic and abdominal cancers.

===Medications===
Over 700 medications, such as penicillin, are known to cause diarrhea. The classes of medications that are known to cause diarrhea are laxatives, antacids, heartburn medications, antibiotics, anti-neoplastic drugs, anti-inflammatories as well as many dietary supplements.

==Pathophysiology==
===Evolution===
According to two researchers, Nesse and Williams, diarrhea may function as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism. As a result, if it is stopped, there might be a delay in recovery. They cite in support of this argument research published in 1973 that found that treating &quot;Shigella&quot; with the anti-diarrhea drug (Co-phenotrope, Lomotil) caused people to stay feverish twice as long as those not so treated. The researchers indeed themselves observed that: &quot;Lomotil may be contraindicated in shigellosis. Diarrhea may represent a defense mechanism&quot;.

== Diagnostic approach ==

The following types of diarrhea may indicate further investigation is needed:

* In infants
* Moderate or severe diarrhea in young children
* Associated with blood
* Continues for more than two days
* Associated non-cramping abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, etc.
* In travelers
* In food handlers, because of the potential to infect others;
* In institutions such as hospitals, child care centers, or geriatric and convalescent homes.

A severity score is used to aid diagnosis in children.

When diarrhea lasts for more than four weeks a number of further tests may be recommended including:

* Complete blood count and a ferritin if anemia is present
* Thyroid stimulating hormone
* Tissue transglutaminase for celiac disease
* Fecal calprotectin to exclude inflammatory bowel disease
* Stool tests for ova and parasites as well as for &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;
* A colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical testing for cancer, including biopsies to detect microscopic colitis
* Testing for bile acid diarrhea with SeHCAT, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one or fecal bile acids depending on availability
* Hydrogen breath test looking for lactose intolerance
* Further tests if immunodeficiency, pelvic radiation disease or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth suspected.

A 2019 guideline recommended that testing for ova and parasites was only needed in people who are at high risk though they recommend routine testing for giardia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were not recommended.

==Epidemiology==

Worldwide in 2004, approximately 2.5 billion cases of diarrhea occurred, which resulted in 1.5 million deaths among children under the age of five. Greater than half of these were in Africa and South Asia. This is down from a death rate of 4.5 million in 1980 for gastroenteritis. Diarrhea remains the second leading cause of infant mortality (16%) after pneumonia (17%) in this age group.

The majority of such cases occur in the developing world, with over half of the recorded cases of childhood diarrhea occurring in Africa and Asia, with 696 million and 1.2 billion cases, respectively, compared to only 480 million in the rest of the world.

Infectious diarrhea resulted in about 0.7 million deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. In the Americas, diarrheal disease accounts for a total of 10% of deaths among children aged 1–59 months while in South East Asia, it accounts for 31.3% of deaths. It is estimated that around 21% of child mortalities in developing countries are due to diarrheal disease.

The World Health Organization has reported that &quot;deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases have dropped by 45%, from sixth leading cause of death in 2000 to thirteenth in 2021.&quot;

Even though diarrhea is best known in humans, it affects many other species, notably among primates. The cecal appendix, when present, appears to afford some protection against diarrhea to young primates.

==Prevention==

===Sanitation===

Numerous studies have shown that improvements in drinking water and sanitation (WASH) lead to decreased risks of diarrhoea. Such improvements might include for example use of water filters, provision of high-quality piped water and sewer connections.

In institutions, communities, and households, interventions that promote hand washing with soap lead to significant reductions in the incidence of diarrhea. The same applies to preventing open defecation at a community-wide level and providing access to improved sanitation. This includes use of toilets and implementation of the entire sanitation chain connected to the toilets (collection, transport, disposal or reuse of human excreta).

There is limited evidence that safe disposal of child or adult feces can prevent diarrheal disease.

====Hand washing====
Basic sanitation techniques can have a profound effect on the transmission of diarrheal disease. The implementation of hand washing using soap and water, for example, has been experimentally shown to reduce the incidence of disease by approximately 30–48%. Hand washing in developing countries, however, is compromised by poverty as acknowledged by the CDC: &quot;Handwashing is integral to disease prevention in all parts of the world; however, access to soap and water is limited in a number of less developed countries. This lack of access is one of many challenges to proper hygiene in less developed countries.&quot; Solutions to this barrier require the implementation of educational programs that encourage sanitary behaviours.

====Water====
Given that water contamination is a major means of transmitting diarrheal disease, efforts to provide clean water supply and improved sanitation have the potential to dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence. In fact, it has been proposed that we might expect an 88% reduction in child mortality resulting from diarrheal disease as a result of improved water sanitation and hygiene. Similarly, a meta-analysis of numerous studies on improving water supply and sanitation shows a 22–27% reduction in disease incidence, and a 21–30% reduction in mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease.

Chlorine treatment of water, for example, has been shown to reduce both the risk of diarrheal disease, and of contamination of stored water with diarrheal pathogens.

===Vaccination===
Immunization against the pathogens that cause diarrheal disease is a viable prevention strategy, however it does require targeting certain pathogens for vaccination. In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2–3%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6–10%. Similarly, a Cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality, though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as Cholera is not one of the major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease. Since this time, more effective vaccines have been developed that have the potential to save many thousands of lives in developing nations, while reducing the overall cost of treatment, and the costs to society.

Rotavirus vaccine decreases the rates of diarrhea in a population. New vaccines against rotavirus, &quot;Shigella&quot;, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), and cholera are under development, as well as other causes of infectious diarrhea.

===Nutrition===
Dietary deficiencies in developing countries can be combated by promoting better eating practices. Zinc supplementation proved successful showing a significant decrease in the incidence of diarrheal disease compared to a control group. The majority of the literature suggests that vitamin A supplementation is advantageous in reducing disease incidence. Development of a supplementation strategy should take into consideration the fact that vitamin A supplementation was less effective in reducing diarrhea incidence when compared to vitamin A and zinc supplementation, and that the latter strategy was estimated to be significantly more cost effective.

====Breastfeeding====
Breastfeeding practices have been shown to have a dramatic effect on the incidence of diarrheal disease in poor populations. Studies across a number of developing nations have shown that those who receive exclusive breastfeeding during their first 6 months of life are better protected against infection with diarrheal diseases. One study in Brazil found that non-breastfed infants were 14 times more likely to die from diarrhea than exclusively breastfed infants. Exclusive breastfeeding is currently recommended for the first six months of an infant&#x27;s life by the WHO, with continued breastfeeding until at least two years of age.

===Others===
Probiotics decrease the risk of diarrhea in those taking antibiotics. Insecticide spraying may reduce fly numbers and the risk of diarrhea in children in a setting where there is seasonal variations in fly numbers throughout the year.

==Management==
In many cases of diarrhea, replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed. This is usually by mouth – oral rehydration therapy – or, in severe cases, intravenously. Diet restrictions such as the BRAT diet are no longer recommended. Research does not support the limiting of milk to children as doing so has no effect on duration of diarrhea. To the contrary, WHO recommends that children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain, and that continuing to eat also speeds up recovery of normal intestinal functioning. CDC recommends that children and adults with cholera also continue to eat. There is no evidence that early refeeding in children can cause an increase in inappropriate use of intravenous fluid, episodes of vomiting, and risk of having persistent diarrhea.

Medications such as loperamide (Imodium) and bismuth subsalicylate may be beneficial; however they may be contraindicated in certain situations.

===Fluids===
Oral rehydration solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened and salty water) can be used to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the &quot;taste of tears&quot;). Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness. Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.

Appropriate amounts of supplemental zinc and potassium should be added if available. But the availability of these should not delay rehydration. As WHO points out, the most important thing is to begin preventing dehydration as early as possible. In another example of prompt ORS hopefully preventing dehydration, CDC recommends for the treatment of cholera continuing to give Oral Rehydration Solution during travel to medical treatment.

Vomiting often occurs during the first hour or two of treatment with ORS, especially if a child drinks the solution too quickly, but this seldom prevents successful rehydration since most of the fluid is still absorbed. WHO recommends that if a child vomits, to wait five or ten minutes and then start to give the solution again more slowly.

Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under five as they may &quot;increase&quot; dehydration. A too rich solution in the gut draws water from the rest of the body, just as if the person were to drink sea water. Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable. Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.

===Eating===
The WHO recommends a child with diarrhea continue to be fed. Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. In contrast, children whose food is restricted have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly. The WHO states &quot;Food should &quot;never&quot; be withheld and the child&#x27;s usual foods should &quot;not&quot; be diluted. Breastfeeding should &quot;always&quot; be continued.&quot; In the specific example of cholera, the CDC makes the same recommendation. Breast-fed infants with diarrhea often choose to breastfeed more, and should be encouraged to do so. In young children who are not breast-fed and live in the developed world, a lactose-free diet may be useful to speed recovery.
Eating food containing soluble fibre may help, but insoluble fibre might make it worse.

===Medications===

Antidiarrheal agents can be classified into four different groups: antimotility, antisecretory, adsorbent, and anti-infectious. While antibiotics are beneficial in certain types of acute diarrhea, they are usually not used except in specific situations. There are concerns that antibiotics may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome in people infected with Escherichia coli O157:H7. In resource-poor countries, treatment with antibiotics may be beneficial. However, some bacteria are developing antibiotic resistance, particularly &quot;Shigella&quot;. Antibiotics can also cause diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea is the most common adverse effect of treatment with general antibiotics.

While bismuth compounds (Pepto-Bismol) decreased the number of bowel movements in those with travelers&#x27; diarrhea, they do not decrease the length of illness. Anti-motility agents like loperamide are also effective at reducing the number of stools but not the duration of disease. These agents should be used only if bloody diarrhea is not present.

Diosmectite, a natural aluminomagnesium silicate clay, is effective in alleviating symptoms of acute diarrhea in children, and also has some effects in chronic functional diarrhea, radiation-induced diarrhea, and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Another absorbent agent used for the treatment of mild diarrhea is kaopectate.

Racecadotril an antisecretory medication may be used to treat diarrhea in children and adults. It has better tolerability than loperamide, as it causes less constipation and flatulence. However, it has little benefit in improving acute diarrhea in children.

Bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine can be effective in chronic diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption. Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if bile acid malabsorption cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as SeHCAT retention.

===Alternative therapies===
Zinc supplementation may benefit children over six months old with diarrhea in areas with high rates of malnourishment or zinc deficiency. This supports the World Health Organization guidelines for zinc, but not in the very young.

A Cochrane Review from 2020 concludes that probiotics make little or no difference to people who have diarrhea lasting 2 days or longer and that there is no proof that they reduce its duration. The probiotic lactobacillus can help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults but possibly not children. For those with lactose intolerance, taking digestive enzymes containing lactase when consuming dairy products often improves symptoms.

<text>is a puzzle video game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. The game was designed in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi and first published in December 1982.

==Gameplay==
The warehouse is a grid composed of floor squares and impassable wall squares. Some floor squares contain a box and some are marked as storage locations. The number of boxes equals the number of storage locations.

The player, often represented as a worker character, can move one square at a time horizontally or vertically onto empty floor squares, but cannot pass through walls or boxes.

To move a box, the player walks up to it and pushes it to an empty square directly beyond the box. Boxes cannot be pushed to squares with walls or other boxes, and they cannot be pulled. 

The puzzle is solved when all boxes are on storage locations.

==Challenges and strategy==
Progressing through the game requires careful planning and precise maneuvering. A single mistake, such as pushing a box into a corner or obstructing the path of others, can render the puzzle unsolvable, forcing the player to backtrack or restart. Anticipating the consequences of each push and considering the overall layout of the puzzle are crucial to avoid deadlocks and complete the puzzle successfully.

==Development==
&quot;Sokoban&quot; was created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi. The first commercial game was published in December 1982 by his company, Thinking Rabbit, based in Takarazuka, Japan. &quot;Sokoban&quot; was a hit in Japan, selling over 400,000 copies before being released in the United States. In 1988, Spectrum HoloByte published &quot;Sokoban&quot; in the U.S. for the IBM PC, Commodore 64, and Apple II as &quot;Soko-Ban&quot;. In 2001, the Japanese software company Falcon acquired the trademarks for &quot;Sokoban&quot; and Thinking Rabbit. Since then, Falcon has continued to develop and license official &quot;Sokoban&quot; games.

==Implementations==
&quot;Sokoban&quot; has been implemented for almost all home computers, personal computers, video game consoles and even some TVs. Versions also exist for mobile phones, graphing calculators, digital cameras and electronic organizers.

==Scientific research==
&quot;Sokoban&quot; has been studied using the theory of computational complexity. The computational problem of solving &quot;Sokoban&quot; puzzles was first shown to be NP-hard. Further work proved it is also PSPACE-complete.

Solving non-trivial &quot;Sokoban&quot; puzzles is difficult for computers because of the high branching factor (many legal pushes at each turn) and the large search depth (many pushes needed to reach a solution). Even small puzzles can require lengthy solutions.

The &quot;Sokoban&quot; game provides a challenging testbed for developing and evaluating planning techniques. The first documented automated solver, Rolling Stone, was developed at the University of Alberta. It employed a conventional search algorithm enhanced with domain-specific techniques such as deadlock detection. A later solver, Festival, introduced the FESS search algorithm and became the first automatic system to solve all 90 puzzles in the widely used XSokoban test suite. Despite these advances, even the most sophisticated solvers cannot solve many highly complex puzzles that humans can solve with time and effort, using their ability to plan ahead, recognize patterns, and reason about long-term consequences.

==Variants==
Several puzzles can be considered variants of the original &quot;Sokoban&quot; game in the sense that they all make use of a controllable character pushing boxes around in a maze.

* Alternative tilings: In the standard game, the mazes are laid out on a square grid. Several variants apply the rules of &quot;Sokoban&quot; to mazes laid out on other tilings. &quot;Hexoban&quot; uses regular hexagons, and &quot;Trioban&quot; uses equilateral triangles.
* Multiple pushers: In the variant &quot;Multiban&quot;, the puzzle contains more than one pusher. In the game &quot;Sokoboxes Duo&quot;, strictly two pushers collaborate to solve the puzzle.
* Designated storage locations: In &quot;Sokomind Plus&quot;, some boxes and target squares are uniquely numbered. In &quot;Block-o-Mania&quot;, the boxes have different colours, and the goal is to push them onto squares with matching colours. 
* Alternative game objectives: Several variants feature different objectives from the traditional &quot;Sokoban&quot; gameplay. For instance, in &quot;Interlock&quot; and &quot;Sokolor&quot;, the boxes have different colours, but the objective is to move them so that similarly coloured boxes are adjacent. In &quot;CyberBox&quot;, each level has a designated exit square, and the objective is to reach that exit by pushing boxes, potentially more than one simultaneously. In a variant called &quot;Beanstalk&quot;, the objective is to push the elements of the level onto a target square in a fixed sequence.
* Additional game elements: &quot;Push Crate&quot;, &quot;Sokonex&quot;, &quot;Xsok&quot;, &quot;Cyberbox&quot; and &quot;Block-o-Mania&quot; all add new elements to the basic puzzle. Examples include holes, teleports, moving blocks and one-way passages.
* Character actions: In &quot;Pukoban&quot;, the character can pull boxes in addition to pushing them.
* Reverse mode: In this variant, the player solves the standard puzzle backward, starting with all boxes on goal squares. Then the player pulls the boxes to reach the initial position. Solutions obtained in reverse mode can be directly applied to solve the standard puzzle by reversing the order of the moves. This makes reverse mode a useful tool for players, allowing them to develop strategies for solving puzzles in the standard game.
