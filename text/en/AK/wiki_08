<text>Vulgar Latin, also known as Colloquial, Popular, or Vernacular Latin, is the range of non-formal registers of Latin spoken from the Late Roman Republic onward. &quot;Vulgar Latin&quot; as a term is both controversial and imprecise. Spoken Latin existed for a long time and in many places. Scholars have differed in opinion as to the extent of the differences, and whether Vulgar Latin was in some sense a different language. This was developed as a theory in the nineteenth century by Raynouard. At its extreme, the theory suggested that the written register formed an elite language distinct from common speech, but this is now rejected. 

The current consensus is that the written and spoken languages formed a continuity much as they do in modern languages, with speech tending to evolve faster than the written language, and the written, formalised language exerting pressure back on speech. &quot;Vulgar Latin&quot; is used in different ways by different scholars, applying it to mean spoken Latin of differing types, or from different social classes and time periods. Nevertheless, interest in the shifts in the spoken forms remains very important to understand the transition from Latin or Late Latin through to Proto-Romance and Romance languages. To make matters more complicated, evidence for spoken forms can be found only through examination of written Classical Latin, Late Latin, or early Romance, depending on the time period.

==History of the Vulgar Latin controversy==
During the Classical period, Roman authors referred to the informal, everyday variety of their own language as &quot;sermo plebeius&quot; or &quot;sermo vulgaris&quot;, meaning &quot;common speech&quot;. This could simply refer to unadorned speech without the use of rhetoric, or even plain speaking. The modern usage of the term Vulgar Latin dates to the Renaissance, when Italian thinkers began to theorize that their own language originated in a sort of &quot;corrupted&quot; Latin that they assumed formed an entity distinct from the literary Classical variety, though opinions differed greatly on the nature of this &quot;vulgar&quot; dialect.

The early 19th-century French linguist François-Just-Marie Raynouard is often regarded as the father of modern Romance philology. Observing that the Romance languages have many features in common that are not found in Latin, at least not in &quot;proper&quot; or Classical Latin, he concluded that the former must have all had some common ancestor (which he believed most closely resembled Old Occitan) that replaced Latin some time before the year 1000. This he dubbed &quot;la langue romane&quot; or &quot;the Romance language&quot;. 

The first truly modern treatise on Romance linguistics and the first to apply the comparative method was Friedrich Christian Diez&#x27;s seminal &quot;Grammar of the Romance Languages&quot;. Researchers such as Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke characterised Vulgar Latin as to a great extent a separate language, that was more or less distinct from the written form. To Meyer-Lübke, the spoken Vulgar form was the genuine and continuous form, while Classical Latin was a kind of artificial idealised language imposed upon it; thus Romance languages were derived from the &quot;real&quot; Vulgar form, which had to be reconstructed from remaining evidence. Others that followed this approach divided Vulgar from Classical Latin by education or class. Other views of &quot;Vulgar Latin&quot; include defining it as uneducated speech, slang, or in effect, Proto-Romance.

The result is that the term &quot;Vulgar Latin&quot; is regarded by some modern philologists as essentially meaningless, but unfortunately very persistent:

the continued use of &quot;Vulgar Latin&quot; is not only no aid to thought, but is, on the contrary, a positive barrier to a clear understanding of Latin and Romance...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish it were possible to hope the term might fall out of use. Many scholars have stated that &quot;Vulgar Latin&quot; is a useless and dangerously misleading term ... To abandon it once and for all can only benefit scholarship.

Lloyd called to replace the use of &quot;Vulgar Latin&quot; with a series of more precise definitions, such as the spoken Latin of a particular time and place. 

Research in the twentieth century has in any case shifted the view to consider the differences between written and spoken Latin in more moderate terms. Just as in modern languages, speech patterns are different from written forms, and vary with education, the same can be said of Latin. For instance, philologist József Herman agrees that the term is problematic, and therefore limits it in his work to mean the innovations and changes that turn up in spoken or written Latin that were relatively uninfluenced by educated forms of Latin. Herman states: it is completely clear from the texts during the time that Latin was a living language, there was never an unbridgeable gap between the written and spoken, nor between the language of the social elites and that of the middle, lower, or disadvantaged groups of the same society.
Herman also makes it clear that Vulgar Latin, in this view, is a varied and unstable phenomenon, crossing many centuries of usage where any generalisations are bound to cover up variations and differences.

== Sources ==

Evidence for the features of non-literary Latin comes from the following sources:

* Explicit mention of certain constructions or pronunciation habits by Roman grammarians.
* Recurrent grammatical, syntactic, or orthographic mistakes in Latin epigraphy.
** Curse tablets, as a special kind of inscription.
* The insertion, whether intentional or not, of colloquial terms or constructions into contemporary texts. Special interest is given to:
** Private letters and documents from an ordinary context such as business records, lists and school exercises; these are rare but papyri from Egypt and tablets from Hadrian&#x27;s Wall have been found.
** Technical works on medicine, agriculture and similar, where the demand for grammatical accuracy was lower, such as the &quot;Mulomedicina Chironis&quot;, a veterinary treatise.
** Christian texts, as many originated from marginalised communities; including early Bible translations and funeral inscriptions.
** Late Latin texts from the sixth century onwards, which show changes, or the absence thereof, in local Latin under the influence of new educational practices and social structures.
* The pronunciation of Roman-era lexical borrowings into neighboring languages such as Basque, Albanian, or Welsh.
* Modern Romance languages, the comparative analysis of which can be used to validate or disprove hypotheses about earlier changes in spoken Latin.

== Fragmentation ==
An oft-posed question is why (or when, or how) Latin “fragmented” into several different languages. Current hypotheses contrast the centralizing and homogenizing socio-economic, cultural, and political forces that characterized the Roman Empire with the centrifugal forces that prevailed afterwards.

By the end of the first century CE the Romans had seized the entire Mediterranean Basin and established hundreds of colonies in the conquered provinces. Over time this—along with other factors that encouraged linguistic and cultural assimilation, such as political unity, frequent travel and commerce, military service, etc.—led to Latin becoming the predominant language throughout the western Mediterranean. Latin itself was subject to the same assimilatory tendencies, such that its varieties had probably become more uniform by the time the Empire fell than they had been before it. That is not to say that the language had been static for all those years, but rather that ongoing changes tended to spread to all regions.

The rise of the first Arab caliphate in the seventh century marked the definitive end of Roman dominance over the Mediterranean. It is from approximately that century onward that regional differences proliferate in Latin documents, indicating the fragmentation of Latin into the incipient Romance languages. Until then Latin appears to have been remarkably homogeneous, as far as can be judged from its written records, although careful statistical analysis reveals regional differences in the treatment of the vowel /ĭ/, and in the frequency of the merger of (original) intervocalic /b/ and /w/, by about the fifth century CE.

== Vocabulary ==
=== Lexical turnover ===
Over the centuries, spoken Latin lost certain words in favour of coinages; in favour of borrowings from neighbouring languages such as Gaulish, Germanic, or Greek; or in favour of other Latin words that had undergone semantic shift. The “lost” words often continued to enjoy some currency in literary Latin, however.

A commonly-cited example is the replacement of the highly irregular (suppletive) verb , meaning &#x27;to carry&#x27;, with the entirely regular . Similarly, the verb &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;to speak&#x27;, was replaced by a variety of alternatives such as the native &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; or the Greek borrowing &quot;&quot;.

Classical Latin particles fared poorly, with all of the following vanishing in the course of its development to Romance: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .

=== Semantic drift ===
Many words experienced a shift in meaning. Some notable cases are &quot;&quot; (&#x27;citizenry&#x27; &quot;→&quot; &#x27;city&#x27;, replacing &quot;&quot;); &quot;focus&quot; (&#x27;hearth&#x27; &quot;→&quot; &#x27;fire&#x27;, replacing &quot;&quot;); &quot;manducare&quot; (&#x27;chew&#x27; &quot;→&quot; &#x27;eat&#x27;, replacing &quot;&quot;); &quot;&quot; (&#x27;subject matter&#x27; &quot;→&quot; &#x27;thing&#x27;, competing with &quot;&quot;); &quot;mittere&quot; (&#x27;send&#x27; → &#x27;put&#x27;, competing with &quot;&quot;); &quot;necare&quot; (&#x27;murder&#x27; &quot;→&quot; &#x27;drown&#x27;, competing with &quot;&quot;); &quot;pacare&quot; (&#x27;placate&#x27; &quot;→&quot; &#x27;pay&#x27;, competing with &quot;&quot;), and &quot;&quot; (&#x27;whole&#x27; &quot;→&quot; &#x27;all, every&#x27;, competing with &quot;&quot;).

== Phonological development ==
=== Consonantism ===
==== Loss of nasals ====

* Word-final /m/ was lost in polysyllabic words. In monosyllables it tended to survive as /n/.
* /n/ was usually lost before fricatives, resulting in compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel (e.g. &quot;&quot; &#x27;fiancée&#x27; &gt; &quot;spōsa&quot;).

==== Palatalization ====
Front vowels in hiatus (after a consonant and before another vowel) became [j], which palatalized preceding consonants.

==== Fricativization ====

/w/ (except after /k/) and intervocalic /b/ merge as the bilabial fricative /β/.

==== Simplification of consonant clusters ====

* The cluster /nkt/ reduced to [ŋt].
* /kw/ delabialized to /k/ before back vowels.
* /ks/ before or after a consonant, or at the end of a word, reduced to /s/.

=== Vocalism ===
==== Monophthongization ====
*/ae̯/ and /oe̯/ monophthongized to [ɛː] and [eː] respectively by around the second century AD.

==== Loss of vowel quantity ====
The system of phonemic vowel length collapsed by the fifth century AD, leaving quality differences as the distinguishing factor between vowels; the paradigm thus changed from /ī ĭ ē ĕ ā ă ŏ ō ŭ ū/ to /i ɪ e ɛ a ɔ o ʊ u/. Concurrently, stressed vowels in open syllables lengthened.

==== Loss of near-close front vowel ====
Towards the end of the Roman Empire /ɪ/ merged with /e/ in most regions, although not in Africa or a few peripheral areas in Italy.

== Grammar ==

=== Romance articles ===
It is difficult to place the point in which the definite article, absent in Latin but present in all Romance languages, arose, largely because the highly colloquial speech in which it arose was seldom written down until the daughter languages had strongly diverged; most surviving texts in early Romance show the articles fully developed.

Definite articles evolved from demonstrative pronouns or adjectives (an analogous development is found in many Indo-European languages, including Greek, Celtic and Germanic); compare the fate of the Latin demonstrative adjective , , &quot;that&quot;, in the Romance languages, becoming French and (Old French &quot;li&quot;, &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;la&quot;), Catalan and Spanish , and , Occitan and , Portuguese and (elision of -l- is a common feature of Portuguese) and Italian , and . Sardinian went its own way here also, forming its article from , an intensive adjective (&quot;su, sa&quot;); some Catalan and Occitan dialects have articles from the same source. While most of the Romance languages put the article before the noun, Romanian has its own way, by putting the article after the noun, e.g. &quot;lupul&quot; (&quot;the wolf&quot; – from *&quot;lupum illum&quot;) and &quot;omul&quot; (&quot;the man&quot; – &quot;*homo illum&quot;), possibly a result of being within the Balkan sprachbund.

The term may have evolved from its initial demonstrative function, broadening to convey semantic prominence by directing the attention of the audience towards particular referents which the speaker intended to highlight. This usage of the term is found in the , which recounts the travels of the Christian pilgrim—and the author—Egeria: the author utilizes the demonstrative to mark words that are crucial to the meaning of the text. For instance, when noting the location of a cave by a church, Egeria clarifies that she is referring to &quot;&quot; (&quot;that church&quot;). The usage of typically occurs alongside nouns that have previously been identified with the text: Egeria, when describing a church near Mount Olivet, initially describes it merely as an &quot;,&quot; but later refers to it as &quot;.&quot; The usage of the demonstratives to denote prominent parts of discourse may have predicated the eventual transformation of the term into a definite article. Once speakers began prefacing sentences with the term, they began utilizing it in a manner similar to an article; therefore, the article-like features of the word eventually become normalized and then incorporated into the standard grammar of the language. 

In Late Latin writings, was often used by writers in relative clauses to establish the identity of subjects not previously mentioned in the text. The 7th-century &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot; clarifies that it is discussing &quot;&quot; (&quot;those men&quot;) before introducing a relative clause in which they are the subject. During this time period, the term also developed anaphoric functions as an extension of the original demonstrative usage: Late Latin authors would substitute more basic mentions of a referent with and added more descriptive information. For instance, the &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot; refers to a &quot;&quot; (&quot;queen&quot;) as &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;that relative of the Franks. From this usage of the , in which it functioned help identify a specific referent, the term may have generalized to adopt more features associated with definite articles. One example of such a development appears in the writings of the 6th-century Gallo-Roman historian Gregory of Tours, who wrote &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;The holy Eugenius was led to the king, and debated with the that Arrian bishop in defense of the Catholic faith.&quot; Within this passage, the ablative form of the pronoun, , is utilized to denote the Arrian bishop, however it appears to function for more like the English article &quot;the&quot; rather than the original Classical Latin : the sentence could be understood equally as well if rendered as &quot;The holy Eugenius was led to the king, and debated with the Arrian bishop in defense of the Catholic faith.&quot; Another indication of the weakening of the demonstratives can be inferred from the fact that at this time, legal and similar texts begin to swarm with , , and so forth (all meaning, essentially, &quot;aforesaid&quot;), which seem to mean little more than &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;. Gregory of Tours writes, &quot;Erat autem... beatissimus Anianus in supradicta civitate episcopus&quot; (&quot;Blessed Anianus was bishop in that city.&quot;) The original Latin demonstrative adjectives were no longer felt to be strong or specific enough.

The Latin pronoun , which was initially used to emphasize specific referents, also developed functions similar to a definite article. However, it retained some of its original emphatic properties: it was also used anaphorically to highlight prominent referents. In one 9th-10th century text from the Diocese of Urgell they utilize the phrase to identify the church the entire paragraph referred to while identifying a unique river, not mentioned previously in the text, as &quot;&quot; (&quot;that river&quot;). Alongside its emphatic usage, the original Classical Latin was also used to clarify referents if the text risked introducing ambiguity regarding the subjects and objects involved. However, in Late Latin literature appears in scenarios in which its presence was not necessary: In the &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot;, a character is introduced as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Waiofar) before—in the next sentence—being described as &quot;&quot; (&quot;the very same Waiofar&quot;). Other documents suggest that and may have eventually assumed practically identical meanings: the 11th-12th century text, the utilizes both terms like definite articles, mentioning &quot;&quot; and &quot;,&quot; both meaning &quot;the authority.&quot;

In the less formal speech, reconstructed forms suggest that the inherited Latin demonstratives were made more forceful by being compounded with (originally an interjection: &quot;behold!&quot;), which also spawned Italian through , a contracted form of &quot;ecce eum&quot;. This is the origin of Old French (*&quot;ecce ille&quot;), (*&quot;ecce iste&quot;) and (*&quot;ecce hic&quot;); Italian (*&quot;eccum istum&quot;), (*&quot;eccum illum&quot;) and (now mainly Tuscan) (*&quot;eccum tibi istum&quot;), as well as (*&quot;eccu hic&quot;), (*&quot;eccum hac&quot;); Spanish and Occitan and Portuguese (*&quot;eccum ille&quot;); Spanish and Portuguese (*&quot;eccum hac&quot;); Spanish and Portuguese (*&quot;eccum hic&quot;); Portuguese (*&quot;eccum illac&quot;) and (*&quot;eccum inde&quot;); Romanian (*&quot;ecce iste&quot;) and (*&quot;ecce ille&quot;), and many other forms.

On the other hand, even in the Oaths of Strasbourg, dictated in Old French in AD 842, no demonstrative appears even in places where one would clearly be called for in all the later languages (&quot;pro christian poblo&quot; – &quot;for the Christian people&quot;). Using the demonstratives as articles may have still been considered overly informal for a royal oath in the 9th century. Considerable variation exists in all of the Romance vernaculars as to their actual use: in Romanian, the articles are suffixed to the noun (or an adjective preceding it), as in other languages of the Balkan sprachbund and the North Germanic languages.

The numeral , (one) supplies the indefinite article in all cases (again, this is a common semantic development across Europe). This is anticipated in Classical Latin; Cicero writes &quot;cum uno gladiatore nequissimo&quot; (&quot;with a most immoral gladiator&quot;). This suggests that &quot;&quot; was beginning to supplant in the meaning of &quot;a certain&quot; or &quot;some&quot; by the 1st century BC.

=== Loss of neuter gender ===

The three grammatical genders of Classical Latin were replaced by a two-gender system in most Romance languages.

The neuter gender of classical Latin was in most cases identical with the masculine both syntactically and morphologically. The confusion had already started in Pompeian graffiti, e.g. &quot;cadaver mortuus&quot; for &quot;cadaver mortuum&quot; (&quot;dead body&quot;), and &quot;hoc locum&quot; for &quot;hunc locum&quot; (&quot;this place&quot;). The morphological confusion shows primarily in the adoption of the nominative ending &quot;-us&quot; (&quot;-Ø&quot; after &quot;-r&quot;) in the &quot;o&quot;-declension.

In Petronius&#x27;s work, one can find &quot;balneus&quot; for (&quot;bath&quot;), &quot;fatus&quot; for (&quot;fate&quot;), &quot;caelus&quot; for (&quot;heaven&quot;), &quot;amphitheater&quot; for (&quot;amphitheatre&quot;), &quot;vinus&quot; for (&quot;wine&quot;), and conversely, &quot;thesaurum&quot; for (&quot;treasure&quot;). Most of these forms occur in the speech of one man: Trimalchion, an uneducated Greek (i.e. foreign) freedman.

In modern Romance languages, the nominative &quot;s&quot;-ending has been largely abandoned, and all substantives of the &quot;o&quot;-declension have an ending derived from &quot;-um&quot;: &quot;-u&quot;, &quot;-o&quot;, or &quot;-Ø&quot;. E.g., masculine (&quot;wall&quot;), and neuter (&quot;sky&quot;) have evolved to: Italian , ; Portuguese , ; Spanish , , Catalan , ; Romanian , &quot;cieru&gt;&quot;; French , . However, Old French still had &quot;-s&quot; in the nominative and &quot;-Ø&quot; in the accusative in both words: &quot;murs&quot;, &quot;ciels&quot; [nominative] – &quot;mur&quot;, &quot;ciel&quot; [oblique].

For some neuter nouns of the third declension, the oblique stem was productive; for others, the nominative/accusative form, (the two were identical in Classical Latin). Evidence suggests that the neuter gender was under pressure well back into the imperial period. French &quot;(le)&quot; , Catalan &quot;(la)&quot; , Occitan &quot;(lo)&quot; , Spanish &quot;(la)&quot; , Portuguese &quot;(o)&quot; , Italian language &quot;(il)&quot; , Leonese &quot;(el) lleche&quot; and Romanian &quot;(le)&quot; (&quot;milk&quot;), all derive from the non-standard but attested Latin nominative/accusative neuter or accusative masculine . In Spanish the word became feminine, while in French, Portuguese and Italian it became masculine (in Romanian it remained neuter, /). Other neuter forms, however, were preserved in Romance; Catalan and French , Leonese, Portuguese and Italian , Romanian (&quot;name&quot;) all preserve the Latin nominative/accusative &quot;nomen&quot;, rather than the oblique stem form *&quot;nomin-&quot; (which nevertheless produced Spanish ).

Most neuter nouns had plural forms ending in or ; some of these were reanalysed as feminine singulars, such as (&quot;joy&quot;), plural &quot;gaudia&quot;; the plural form lies at the root of the French feminine singular &quot;(la)&quot; , as well as of Catalan and Occitan &quot;(la)&quot; (Italian &quot;la&quot; is a borrowing from French); the same for (&quot;wood stick&quot;), plural &quot;ligna&quot;, that originated the Catalan feminine singular noun &quot;(la)&quot; , Portuguese &quot;(a)&quot; , Spanish &quot;(la)&quot; and Italian &quot;(la)&quot; . Some Romance languages still have a special form derived from the ancient neuter plural which is treated grammatically as feminine: e.g., &quot;arm(s)&quot; → Italian &quot;(il)&quot; : &quot;(le) braccia&quot;, Romanian : &quot;brațe(le)&quot;. Cf. also Merovingian Latin &quot;ipsa animalia aliquas mortas fuerant&quot;.

Alternations in Italian heteroclitic nouns such as &quot;l&#x27;uovo fresco&quot; (&quot;the fresh egg&quot;) / &quot;le uova fresche&quot; (&quot;the fresh eggs&quot;) are usually analysed as masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, with an irregular plural in &quot;-a&quot;. However, it is also consistent with their historical development to say that is simply a regular neuter noun (, plural &quot;ova&quot;) and that the characteristic ending for words agreeing with these nouns is &quot;-o&quot; in the singular and &quot;-e&quot; in the plural. The same alternation in gender exists in certain Romanian nouns, but is considered regular as it is more common than in Italian. Thus, a relict neuter gender can arguably be said to persist in Italian and Romanian.

In Portuguese, traces of the neuter plural can be found in collective formations and words meant to inform a bigger size or sturdiness. Thus, one can use &quot;(s)&quot; (&quot;egg(s)&quot;) and &quot;(s)&quot; (&quot;roe&quot;, &quot;collection(s) of eggs&quot;), &quot;(s)&quot; (&quot;section(s) of an edge&quot;) and &quot;(s&quot;) (&quot;edge(s)&quot;), &quot;(s)&quot; (&quot;bag(s)&quot;) and &quot;(s&quot;) (&quot;sack(s)&quot;), &quot;(s)&quot; (&quot;cloak(s)&quot;) and &quot;(s)&quot; (&quot;blanket(s)&quot;). Other times, it resulted in words whose gender may be changed more or less arbitrarily, like / (&quot;fruit&quot;), / (&quot;broth&quot;), etc.

These formations were especially common when they could be used to avoid irregular forms. In Latin, the names of trees were usually feminine, but many were declined in the second declension paradigm, which was dominated by masculine or neuter nouns. Latin (&quot;pear tree&quot;), a feminine noun with a masculine-looking ending, became masculine in Italian &quot;(il)&quot; and Romanian ; in French and Spanish it was replaced by the masculine derivations &quot;(le)&quot; , &quot;(el)&quot; ; and in Portuguese and Catalan by the feminine derivations &quot;(a)&quot; , &quot;(la)&quot; .

As usual, irregularities persisted longest in frequently used forms. From the fourth declension noun &quot;manus&quot; (&quot;hand&quot;), another feminine noun with the ending &quot;-us&quot;, Italian and Spanish derived &quot;(la)&quot; , Romanian &quot;mânu&gt;&quot;, pl. / (reg.) &quot;mâni&quot;, Catalan &quot;(la)&quot; , and Portuguese &quot;(a)&quot; , which preserve the feminine gender along with the masculine appearance.

Except for the Italian and Romanian heteroclitic nouns, other major Romance languages have no trace of neuter nouns, but still have neuter pronouns. French / / (&quot;this&quot;), Spanish / / (&quot;this&quot;), Italian: / / (&quot;to him&quot; /&quot;to her&quot; / &quot;to it&quot;), Catalan: , , , (&quot;it&quot; / &quot;this&quot; / &quot;this-that&quot; / &quot;that over there&quot;); Portuguese: / / (&quot;all of him&quot; / &quot;all of her&quot; / &quot;all of it&quot;).

In Spanish, a three-way contrast is also made with the definite articles , , and . The last is used with nouns denoting abstract categories: &quot;lo bueno&quot;, literally &quot;that which is good&quot;, from : good.

=== Loss of oblique cases ===
The Vulgar Latin vowel shifts caused the merger of several case endings in the nominal and adjectival declensions. Some of the causes include: the loss of final &quot;m&quot;, the merger of &quot;ă&quot; with &quot;ā&quot;, and the merger of &quot;ŭ&quot; with &quot;ō&quot; (see tables). Thus, by the 5th century, the number of case contrasts had been drastically reduced.


There also seems to be a marked tendency to confuse different forms even when they had not become homophonous (like the generally more distinct plurals), which indicates that nominal declension was shaped not only by phonetic mergers, but also by structural factors. As a result of the untenability of the noun case system after these phonetic changes, Vulgar Latin shifted from a markedly synthetic language to a more analytic one.
The genitive case died out around the 3rd century AD, according to Meyer-Lübke, and began to be replaced by &quot;de&quot; + noun (which originally meant &quot;about/concerning&quot;, weakened to &quot;of&quot;) as early as the 2nd century BC. Exceptions of remaining genitive forms are some pronouns, certain fossilized expressions and some proper names. For example, French (&quot;Thursday&quot;) &lt; Old French &quot;juesdi&quot; &lt; Vulgar Latin &quot;&quot;; Spanish &quot;es&quot; (&quot;it is necessary&quot;) &lt; &quot;est &quot;; and Italian (&quot;earthquake&quot;) &lt; &quot;&quot; as well as names like &quot;Paoli&quot;, &quot;Pieri&quot;.

The dative case lasted longer than the genitive, even though Plautus, in the 2nd century BC, already shows some instances of substitution by the construction &quot;ad&quot; + accusative. For example, &quot;ad carnuficem dabo&quot;.

The accusative case developed as a prepositional case, displacing many instances of the ablative. Towards the end of the imperial period, the accusative came to be used more and more as a general oblique case.

Despite increasing case mergers, nominative and accusative forms seem to have remained distinct for much longer, since they are rarely confused in inscriptions. Even though Gaulish texts from the 7th century rarely confuse both forms, it is believed that both cases began to merge in Africa by the end of the empire, and a bit later in parts of Italy and Iberia. Nowadays, Romanian maintains a two-case system, while Old French and Old Occitan had a two-case subject-oblique system.

This Old French system was based largely on whether or not the Latin case ending contained an &quot;s&quot; or not, with the &quot;s&quot; being retained but all vowels in the ending being lost (as with &quot;veisin&quot; below). But since this meant that it was easy to confuse the singular nominative with the plural oblique, and the plural nominative with the singular oblique, this case system ultimately collapsed as well, and Middle French adopted one case (usually the oblique) for all purposes. 

Today, Romanian is generally considered the only Romance language with a surviving case system. However, some dialects of Romansh retain a special predicative form of the masculine singular identical to the plural: &quot;il bien vin&quot; (&quot;the good wine&quot;) vs. &quot;il vin ei buns&quot; (&quot;the wine is good&quot;). This &quot;predicative case&quot; (as it is sometimes called) is a remnant of the Latin nominative in &quot;-us&quot;.
=== Wider use of prepositions ===
The loss of a productive noun case system meant that the syntactic purposes it formerly served now had to be performed by prepositions and other paraphrases. These particles increased in number, and many new ones were formed by compounding old ones. The descendant Romance languages are full of grammatical particles such as Spanish , &quot;where&quot;, from Latin + (which in Romanian literally means &quot;from where&quot;/&quot;where from&quot;), or French , &quot;since&quot;, from + , while the equivalent Spanish and Portuguese is &quot;de&quot; + &quot;ex&quot; + &quot;de&quot;. Spanish and Portuguese , &quot;after&quot;, represent &quot;de&quot; + &quot;ex&quot; + .

Some of these new compounds appear in literary texts during the late empire; French , Spanish &quot;de&quot; and Portuguese &quot;de&quot; (&quot;outside&quot;) all represent &quot;de&quot; + (Romanian – &quot;ad&quot; + &quot;foris&quot;), and we find Jerome writing &quot;stulti, nonne qui fecit, quod de foris est, etiam id, quod de intus est fecit?&quot; (Luke 11.40: &quot;ye fools, did not he, that made which is without, make that which is within also?&quot;). In some cases, compounds were created by combining a large number of particles, such as the Romanian (&quot;just recently&quot;) from &quot;ad&quot; + &quot;de&quot; + &quot;in&quot; + &quot;illa&quot; + &quot;hora&quot;.

Classical Latin:
:&quot;Marcus patrī librum dat.&quot; &quot;Marcus is giving [his] father [a/the] book.&quot;

Vulgar Latin:
:&quot;*Marcos da libru a patre.&quot; &quot;Marcus is giving [a/the] book to [his] father.&quot;

Just as in the disappearing dative case, colloquial Latin sometimes replaced the disappearing genitive case with the preposition &quot;de&quot; followed by the ablative, then eventually the accusative (oblique).

Classical Latin:
:&quot;Marcus mihi librum patris dat.&quot; &quot;Marcus is giving me [his] father&#x27;s book.

Vulgar Latin:
:&quot;*Marcos mi da libru de patre.&quot; &quot;Marcus is giving me [the] book of [his] father.&quot;

=== Pronouns ===
Unlike in the nominal and adjectival inflections, pronouns kept a great part of the case distinctions. However, many changes happened. For example, the of &quot;ego&quot; was lost by the end of the empire, and &quot;eo&quot; appears in manuscripts from the 6th century.
=== Adverbs ===
Classical Latin had a number of different suffixes that made adverbs from adjectives: , &quot;dear&quot;, formed , &quot;dearly&quot;; , &quot;fiercely&quot;, from ; , &quot;often&quot;, from . All of these derivational suffixes were lost in Vulgar Latin.

An alternative formation with a feminine ablative form modifying (originally the ablative of &quot;mēns&quot;, and so meaning &quot;with a ... mind&quot;) gave rise to a widespread rule for forming adverbs in many Romance languages: adding the suffix -&quot;ment(e)&quot; to the feminine form of the adjective. So (&quot;quick&quot;) instead of (&quot;quickly&quot;) gave &quot;veloci mente&quot; (originally &quot;with a quick mind&quot;, &quot;quick-mindedly&quot;), and &quot;-mente&quot; became a productive suffix for forming adverbs in Romance such as Italian , Spanish &#x27;clearly&#x27;. The development of an originally autonomous form (the noun &quot;mente&quot;, meaning &#x27;mind&#x27;) into a suffix (although remaining in free lexical use in other contexts e.g. Italian &quot;venire in mente&quot; &#x27;come to mind&#x27;) is a textbook case of grammaticalization. 

=== Verbs ===


In general, the verbal system in the Romance languages changed less from Classical Latin than did the nominal system.

The four conjugational classes generally survived. The second and third conjugations already had identical imperfect tense forms in Latin, and also shared a common present participle. Because of the merging of short &quot;i&quot; with long &quot;ē&quot; in most of Vulgar Latin, these two conjugations grew even closer together. Several of the most frequently-used forms became indistinguishable, while others became distinguished only by stress placement:
These two conjugations came to be conflated in many of the Romance languages, often by merging them into a single class while taking endings from each of the original two conjugations. Which endings survived was different for each language, although most tended to favour second conjugation endings over the third conjugation. Spanish, for example, mostly eliminated the third conjugation forms in favour of the second conjugation forms.

French and Catalan did the same, but tended to generalise the third conjugation infinitive instead. Catalan in particular almost eliminated the second conjugation ending over time, reducing it to a small relic class. In Italian, the two infinitive endings remained separate (but spelled identically), while the conjugations merged in most other respects much as in the other languages. However, the third-conjugation third-person plural present ending survived in favour of the second conjugation version, and was even extended to the fourth conjugation. Romanian also maintained the distinction between the second and third conjugation endings.

In the perfect, many languages generalized the &quot;-aui&quot; ending most frequently found in the first conjugation. This led to an unusual development; phonetically, the ending was treated as the diphthong rather than containing a semivowel , and in other cases the sound was simply dropped. We know this because it did not participate in the sound shift from to . Thus Latin &quot;amaui&quot;, &quot;amauit&quot; (&quot;I loved; he/she loved&quot;) in many areas became proto-Romance *&quot;amai&quot; and *&quot;amaut&quot;, yielding for example Portuguese &quot;amei&quot;, &quot;amou&quot;. This suggests that in the spoken language, these changes in conjugation preceded the loss of .

Another major systemic change was to the future tense, remodelled in Vulgar Latin with auxiliary verbs. A new future was originally formed with the auxiliary verb , *&quot;amare habeo&quot;, literally &quot;to love I have&quot; (cf. English &quot;I have to love&quot;, which has shades of a future meaning). This was contracted into a new future suffix in Western Romance forms, which can be seen in the following modern examples of &quot;I will love&quot;:
* (&quot;je&quot; + &quot;aimer&quot; + &quot;ai&quot;) ← &quot;aimer&quot; [&quot;to love&quot;] + &quot;ai&quot; [&quot;I have&quot;].
* Portuguese and (&quot;amar&quot; + [&quot;h&quot;]&quot;ei&quot;) ← &quot;amar&quot; [&quot;to love&quot;] + &quot;hei&quot; [&quot;I have&quot;]
* Spanish and (&quot;amar&quot; + [&quot;h&quot;]&quot;e&quot;) ← &quot;amar&quot; [&quot;to love&quot;] + &quot;he&quot; [&quot;I have&quot;].
* (&quot;amar&quot; + [&quot;h&quot;]&quot;o&quot;) ← &quot;amare&quot; [&quot;to love&quot;] + &quot;ho&quot; [&quot;I have&quot;].

The first historical attestation of this new future can be found in a 7th-century Latin text, the &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot;

A periphrastic construction of the form &#x27;to have to&#x27; (late Latin &quot;habere ad&quot;) used as future is characteristic of Sardinian: 
* &quot;Ap&#x27;a istàre&quot; &lt; &quot;apo a istàre&quot; &#x27;I will stay&#x27;
* &quot;Ap&#x27;a nàrrere&quot; &lt; &quot;apo a nàrrer&quot; &#x27;I will say&#x27;

An innovative conditional (distinct from the subjunctive) also developed in the same way (infinitive + conjugated form of &quot;habere&quot;). The fact that the future and conditional endings were originally independent words is still evident in literary Portuguese, which in these tenses allows clitic object pronouns to be incorporated between the root of the verb and its ending: &quot;I will love&quot; (&quot;eu&quot;) &quot;amarei&quot;, but &quot;I will love you&quot; &quot;amar-te-ei&quot;, from &quot;amar&quot; + &quot;te&quot; [&quot;you&quot;] + (&quot;eu&quot;) &quot;hei&quot; = &quot;amar&quot; + &quot;te&quot; + [&quot;h&quot;]&quot;ei&quot; = &quot;amar-te-ei&quot;.

In Spanish, Italian, Romanian and Portuguese, personal pronouns can still be omitted from verb phrases as in Latin, as the endings are still distinct enough to convey that information: &quot;venio&quot; &gt; Sp &quot;vengo&quot; (&quot;I come&quot;). In French, however, all the endings are typically homophonous except the first and second person (and occasionally also third person) plural, so the pronouns are always used (&quot;je viens&quot;) except in the imperative.

Contrary to the millennia-long continuity of much of the active verb system, which has now survived 6000 years of known evolution, the synthetic passive voice was utterly lost in Romance, being replaced with periphrastic verb forms—composed of the verb &quot;to be&quot; plus a passive participle—or impersonal reflexive forms—composed of a verb and a passivizing pronoun.

Apart from the grammatical and phonetic developments there were many cases of verbs merging as complex subtleties in Latin were reduced to simplified verbs in Romance. A classic example of this are the verbs expressing the concept &quot;to go&quot;. Consider three particular verbs in Classical Latin expressing concepts of &quot;going&quot;: , , and *&quot;ambitare&quot;. In Spanish and Portuguese &quot;ire&quot; and &quot;vadere&quot; merged into the verb &quot;ir&quot;, which derives some conjugated forms from &quot;ire&quot; and some from &quot;vadere&quot;. &quot;andar&quot; was maintained as a separate verb derived from &quot;ambitare&quot;.

Italian instead merged &quot;vadere&quot; and &quot;ambitare&quot; into the verb . At the extreme French merged three Latin verbs with, for example, the present tense deriving from &quot;vadere&quot; and another verb &quot;ambulare&quot; (or something like it) and the future tense deriving from &quot;ire&quot;. 
Similarly the Romance distinction between the Romance verbs for &quot;to be&quot;, and , was lost in French as these merged into the verb . In Italian, the verb inherited both Romance meanings of &quot;being essentially&quot; and &quot;being temporarily of the quality of&quot;, while specialized into a verb denoting location or dwelling, or state of health.

==== Copula ====
The copula (that is, the verb signifying &quot;to be&quot;) of Classical Latin was . This evolved to *&quot;essere&quot; in Vulgar Latin by attaching the common infinitive suffix &quot;-re&quot; to the classical infinitive; this produced Italian and French through Proto-Gallo-Romance *&quot;essre&quot; and Old French as well as Spanish and Portuguese (Romanian &quot;a&quot; derives from &quot;fieri&quot;, which means &quot;to become&quot;).

In Vulgar Latin a second copula developed utilizing the verb , which originally meant (and is cognate with) &quot;to stand&quot;, to denote a more temporary meaning. That is, *&quot;essere&quot; signified the &quot;esse&quot;nce, while &quot;stare&quot; signified the &quot;state.&quot; &quot;Stare&quot; evolved to Spanish and Portuguese and Old French (both through *&quot;estare&quot;), Romanian &quot;a sta&quot; (&quot;to stand&quot;), using the original form for the noun (&quot;stare&quot;=&quot;state&quot;/&quot;starea&quot;=&quot;the state&quot;), while Italian retained the original form.

The semantic shift that underlies this evolution is more or less as follows: A speaker of Classical Latin might have said: &quot;vir est in foro&quot;, meaning &quot;the man is in/at the marketplace&quot;. The same sentence in Vulgar Latin could have been *&quot;(h)omo stat in foro&quot;, &quot;the man stands in/at the marketplace&quot;, replacing the &quot;est&quot; (from &quot;esse&quot;) with &quot;stat&quot; (from &quot;stare&quot;), because &quot;standing&quot; was what was perceived as what the man was actually doing.

The use of &quot;stare&quot; in this case was still semantically transparent assuming that it meant &quot;to stand&quot;, but soon the shift from &quot;esse&quot; to &quot;stare&quot; became more widespread. In the Iberian peninsula &quot;esse&quot; ended up only denoting natural qualities that would not change, while &quot;stare&quot; was applied to transient qualities and location. In Italian, &quot;stare&quot; is used mainly for location, transitory state of health (&quot;sta male&quot; &#x27;s/he is ill&#x27; but &quot;è gracile&quot; &#x27;s/he is puny&#x27;) and, as in Spanish, for the eminently transient quality implied in a verb&#x27;s progressive form, such as &quot;sto scrivendo&quot; to express &#x27;I am writing&#x27;.

The historical development of the &quot;stare&quot; + ablative gerund progressive tense in those Romance languages that have it seems to have been a passage from a usage such as &quot;sto pensando&quot; &#x27;I stand/stay (here) in thinking&#x27;, in which the &quot;stare&quot; form carries the full semantic load of &#x27;stand, stay&#x27; to grammaticalization of the construction as expression of progressive aspect (Similar in concept to the Early Modern English construction of &quot;I am a-thinking&quot;). The process of reanalysis that took place over time bleached the semantics of &quot;stare&quot; so that when used in combination with the gerund the form became solely a grammatical marker of subject and tense (e.g. &quot;sto&quot; = subject first person singular, present; &quot;stavo&quot; = subject first person singular, past), no longer a lexical verb with the semantics of &#x27;stand&#x27; (not unlike the auxiliary in compound tenses that once meant &#x27;have, possess&#x27;, but is now semantically empty: &quot;j&#x27;ai écrit&quot;, ho scritto&quot;, he escrito&quot;, etc.). Whereas &quot;sto scappando&quot; would once have been semantically strange at best (?&#x27;I stay escaping&#x27;), once grammaticalization was achieved, collocation with a verb of inherent mobility was no longer contradictory, and &quot;sto scappando&quot; could and did become the normal way to express &#x27;I am escaping&#x27;. (Although it might be objected that in sentences like Spanish &quot;la catedral está en la ciudad&quot;, &quot;the cathedral is in the city&quot; this is also unlikely to change, but all locations are expressed through &quot;estar&quot; in Spanish, as this usage originally conveyed the sense of &quot;the cathedral &quot;stands&quot; in the city&quot;).

=== Word order typology ===
Classical Latin in most cases adopted an SOV word order in ordinary prose, although other word orders were employed, such as in poetry, euphony, focus, or emphasis, enabled by inflectional marking of the grammatical function of words. However, word order in most of the modern Romance languages generally adopted a standard SVO word order. Relics of SOV word order still survive in the placement of clitic object pronouns (e.g. Spanish &#x27;I love you&#x27;).

<text>Steinway &amp; Sons, also known as Steinway (), is a German-American piano company, founded in 1853 in New York City by German piano builder Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (later known as Henry E. Steinway). The company&#x27;s growth led to a move to a larger factory in New York, and later opening an additional factory in Hamburg, Germany. The New York factory, in the borough of Queens, supplies the Americas, and the factory in Hamburg supplies the rest of the world.

Steinway is a prominent piano company, known for its high quality and for inventions within the area of piano development. Steinway has been granted 139 patents in piano making, with the first in 1857. The company&#x27;s share of the high-end grand piano market consistently exceeds 80 percent. The dominant position has been criticized, with some musicians and writers arguing that it has blocked innovation and led to a homogenization of the sound favored by pianists.

Steinway pianos have received numerous awards. One of the first is a gold medal in 1855 at the American Institute Fair at the New York Crystal Palace. From 1855 to 1862, Steinway pianos received 35 gold medals. More awards and recognitions followed, including three medals at the International Exposition of 1867 in Paris. The European part of the company held a royal warrant of appointment to Queen Elizabeth II. Steinway &amp; Sons was named &quot;Company of the Year&quot; in 1996 by &quot;The Music Trades&quot; magazine. The award was given in recognition of Steinway&#x27;s &quot;overall performance, quality, value-added products, a well-executed promotional program and disciplined distribution which generated the most impressive results in the entire music industry.&quot; In addition to the Steinway piano line, Steinway markets two other, lower-priced brands of piano sold under the brand names &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot;.

==History==

===Foundation and growth===


Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg first made pianos in the 1820s from his house in Seesen, Germany. He made pianos under the &quot;Steinweg&quot; brand until he emigrated from Germany to America in 1850 with his wife and seven of his nine children. The eldest son, C. F. Theodor Steinweg, remained in Germany, and continued making the Steinweg brand of pianos, partnering with Friedrich Grotrian, a piano dealer, from 1856 to 1865.

In 1853, Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg founded Steinway &amp; Sons. His first workshop in America was in a small loft at the back of 85 Varick Street in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The first piano made by Steinway &amp; Sons was given the number 483 because Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg had built 482 pianos in Germany. Number 483 was sold to a New York family for $500, and is now on display at the Städtisches Museum Seesen, the town in which Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg began his career as a piano maker. A year later, demand was such that the company moved to larger premises at 82–88 Walker Street. It was not until 1864 that the family anglicized their name from &quot;Steinweg&quot; to &quot;Steinway&quot;.

By the 1860s, Steinway had built and moved into a factory at Park Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Street (the present site of the Seagram Building) where it covered a whole block. With a workforce of 350 men, production increased from 500 to nearly 1,800 pianos per year. The employees were mostly German immigrants and the official language of the company was German. The pianos themselves underwent numerous substantial improvements through innovations made both at the Steinway factory and elsewhere in the industry based on emerging engineering and scientific research, including developments in the understanding of acoustics. Almost half of the company&#x27;s 139 patented inventions were developed by the first and second generations of the Steinway family. Steinway&#x27;s pianos won prizes at exhibitions in New York City, London, and Paris. By 1862, Steinway pianos had received more than 35 medals. Part of Steinway&#x27;s early reputation arose from its successes in trade fairs.

In 1865, the Steinway family sent a letter to C. F. Theodor Steinweg asking that he leave the German Steinweg factory (by then located in Braunschweig (Brunswick)) and travel to New York City to take over the leadership of the family firm due to the deaths of his brothers Henry and Charles from disease. C. F. Theodor Steinweg obeyed, selling his share of the German piano company to his partner Wilhelm Grotrian (son of Friedrich Grotrian) and two other workmen, Adolph Helfferich and H. G. W. Schulz. The German factory changed its name from &quot;C. F. Theodor Steinweg&quot; to &quot;Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf.&quot; (), later shortened to &quot;Grotrian-Steinweg&quot;. In New York City, C. F. Theodor Steinweg anglicized his name to C. F. Theodore Steinway. During the next 15 years of his leadership, he kept a home in Braunschweig and traveled often between Germany and the United States.

Through 1870–80, William Steinway (born Wilhelm Steinweg, a son of Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg) established a company town after purchasing a home and its surrounding property from the widow of Benjamin Pike Jr., that would later bear his name as the Steinway Mansion. This company town would go on to become &quot;Steinway Village&quot; in what is now the Astoria neighborhood of Queens in New York City. Steinway Village was built as its own town, and included a new factory (still used today) with its own foundry and sawmill, houses for employees, kindergarten, lending library, post office, volunteer fire department, and parks. Steinway Village later became part of Long Island City. Steinway Street, one of the major streets in the Astoria and Long Island City neighborhoods of Queens, is named after the company.

In 1876, Steinway participated in the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. The competition among piano makers principally involved Steinway, Chickering, and Weber. According to journalist James Barron&#x27;s account of Steinway&#x27;s participation in the competition, the company was able to secure success by bribing one of the judges. William Steinway denied to the exposition&#x27;s organizers that a judge had been paid directly, although Barron states that the judge was bribed through an intermediary, the pianist Frederic Boscovitz. According to freelancer Isabel Wolff, William Steinway admitted in his diary that under his leadership the New York City arm of the company bribed judges at trade fairs to favor Steinway pianos. According to musicologist Donald W. Fostle, it is untrue that Steinway repeatedly bribed judges at trade fairs, and in the one documented case it is unclear if Steinway were enmeshed, along with others, in bribery or were the target of attempted extortion.

To reach European customers who wanted Steinway pianos, and to avoid high European import taxes, William Steinway and C. F. Theodore Steinway established a new piano factory in the free German city of Hamburg in 1880. The first address of Steinway&#x27;s factory in Hamburg was at Schanzenstraße in the western part of Hamburg, St. Pauli. C. F. Theodore Steinway became the head of the German factory, and William Steinway went back to the factory in New York. The two factories regularly exchanged experience about their patents and techniques despite the large distance between them, and they continue to do so today. C. F. Theodore Steinway was a talented inventor who made many improvements in the construction of the piano. About a third of Steinway&#x27;s patented inventions are under the name of C. F. Theodore Steinway. The Steinway factory in Hamburg was part laboratory, part factory. Much of the precision cutting and drilling machinery installed in the New York factory was tried in the Hamburg factory first. C. F. Theodore Steinway died in Braunschweig in 1889, having successfully competed against the Grotrian-Steinweg brand – both the Hamburg-based Steinway factory and the Braunschweig-based Grotrian-Steinweg factory became known for making premium German pianos.

Meanwhile, the 1880s saw the company embroiled in a series of labor disputes between the New York City factory&#x27;s management and workers. Back then, industrialists faced labor strikes frequently. One dispute, in 1880, saw the company lead an industry-wide lockout of piano workers in New York City. In later disputes in the decade, the company hired detectives to spy on its workers, paid police to take management&#x27;s side in the dispute and to protect company property, and evicted strike leaders from company housing.

In 1883, the Hungarian composer and pianist Franz Liszt wrote in a letter to Steinway: &quot;...The new Steinway grand is a glorious masterpiece in power, sonority, singing quality, and perfect harmonic effects, affording delight even to my old piano-weary fingers. Ever continuing success remains a beautiful attribute of the world-renowned firm of Steinway &amp; Sons. ...Owing to my ignorance of the mechanism of piano construction I can but praise the magnificent result in the volume and quality of sound.&quot;

In 1890, Steinway received its first royal warrant, granted by Queen Victoria. The following year the patrons of Steinway included the Prince of Wales and other members of royalty and nobility. In subsequent years Steinway was granted royal and imperial warrants from the rulers of Italy, Norway, Persia, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey.

===Steinway Halls===

From 1864 to 1866, William Steinway, who is credited with establishing Steinway&#x27;s success in marketing, oversaw the construction of Steinway Hall on East 14th Street in Manhattan, New York City. Steinway Hall had cost $200,000 to build. It included the second largest concert hall in New York City as well as showrooms for Steinway pianos. To enter the concert hall concertgoers had to pass through the showrooms, a way to advertise Steinway pianos. Sales increased by more than 400 pianos in 1867. Steinway Hall quickly became one of New York City&#x27;s most prominent cultural centers, housing the New York Philharmonic for the next 25 years until Carnegie Hall opened in 1891.

In 1925, the Steinway Hall on East 14th Street was closed and a new Steinway Hall on West 57th Street was opened. In 2013, Steinway sold the Steinway Hall on West 57th Street for $46 million and moved out of the building at the end of 2014. In 2016, a new Steinway Hall opened on Sixth Avenue.

A second Steinway Hall was opened in London in 1875. It was located first on Wigmore Street, in 1924 it moved to St. George Street, and later it moved to its current address on Marylebone Lane.

===Expansion===
In 1857, Steinway began to make a line of art case pianos, designed by artists. In 1903, the 100,000th Steinway grand piano was given as a gift to the White House; it was decorated by the artist Thomas Wilmer Dewing. The 100,000th Steinway grand piano was replaced in 1938 by the 300,000th, which remains in use in the White House. The piano is normally placed in the largest room of the White House, the East Room.

Later, Steinway diversified into the manufacture of player pianos. Several systems such as the Welte-Mignon, Duo-Art, and Ampico were incorporated. During the 1920s, Steinway had been selling up to 6,000 pianos a year. In 1929, Steinway constructed one double-keyboard grand piano. It has 164 keys and 4 pedals. (In 2005, Steinway refurbished this instrument).

During World War II, the Steinway factory in New York received orders from the Allied Armies to build wooden gliders to convey troops behind enemy lines. Steinway could make few normal pianos, but built 2,436 special models called the &quot;Victory Vertical&quot; or &quot;G.I. Piano&quot;. It was a small piano that four men could lift, painted olive drab, gray, or blue, designed to be carried aboard ships or dropped by parachute from an airplane to bring music to the soldiers.

The factory in Hamburg, Germany, could sell very few pianos during World War II. No more than a hundred pianos per year left the factory. In the later years of the war, the company was ordered to give up all the prepared and dried wood their lumber yard held for war production. In an air raid over Hamburg, several Allied bombs hit the factory and nearly destroyed it. After the war, Steinway restored the Hamburg factory with help from the Marshall Plan.

In the late 1960s, Steinway brought countersuit against &quot;Grotrian-Steinweg&quot; to stop them from using the name &quot;Steinweg&quot; on their pianos. Steinway won the case on appeal in 1975, forcing their competitor to use only the name &quot;Grotrian&quot; in the United States. The case set a precedent and established the concept of Initial Interest Confusion, in which consumers might be initially attracted to a similarly named but lesser-known brand because of the stronger brand&#x27;s good reputation.

===The 500,000th Steinway===
In 1988, Steinway made its 500,000th piano. Designed by artist Wendell Castle, it carries inscriptions of the names of the 832 pianists and 90 ensembles on the Steinway Artist roster of 1987, including Van Cliburn, Vladimir Horowitz and Billy Joel.

Six years later the company launched &quot;C. F. Theodore Steinway Academy for Concert Technicians&quot;, known simply as &quot;Steinway Academy&quot;, at Steinway&#x27;s factory in Hamburg, Germany. There, experienced piano tuners and piano technicians from all over the world receive further training in piano tuning and maintenance. By 2000, Steinway had made its 550,000th piano.

In 2003, Steinway celebrated its 150th anniversary at Carnegie Hall with a three-day concert series with performances by Peter Cincotti, Art Garfunkel, Herbie Hancock, Ben Heppner, Ahmad Jamal, Ramsey Lewis, Randy Newman, Roger Williams, Nancy Wilson, Yundi Li and Eroica Trio, among others. The first concert featured classical music, the second jazz, and the third pop. As part of the 150th anniversary, fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld created a commemorative Steinway limited edition grand piano.

In 2005, Steinway celebrated the 125th anniversary of the establishment of its factory in Hamburg, Germany. The celebration featured a concert at the Laeiszhalle concert hall in Hamburg with performances by Vladimir and Vovka Ashkenazy, Lang Lang, and Detlef Kraus. 1,800 people from 33 countries attended the concert. As part of the celebration, a 125th anniversary Steinway limited edition grand piano was designed by Count Albrecht von Goertz.

Until his death on September 18, 2008, at the age of 93, Henry Z. Steinway, the great-grandson of the Steinway founder, still worked for Steinway and put his signature on custom-made limited-edition pianos. At several public occasions, Henry Z. Steinway represented the Steinway family. He started at the company in 1937 after graduating from Harvard University. He was president of the company from 1956 to 1977 and was the last Steinway family member to be president of Steinway.

===Changes in ownership===
In 1972, after a lengthy strike, a long-running financial struggle, high legal expenses, and a lack of business interest among some of the Steinway family members, the firm was sold to CBS. At that time, CBS owned many enterprises in the entertainment industry, including electric guitar and amplifier maker Fender, drum maker Rogers, electro-mechanical piano maker Rhodes, and the baseball team New York Yankees. CBS had plans to form a musical conglomerate that made and sold music in all forms and through all outlets, including records, radio, television, and musical instruments. This new conglomerate was evidently not as successful as CBS had expected, and Steinway was sold in 1985, along with classical and church organ maker Rodgers and flute and piccolo maker Gemeinhardt, to a group of Boston-area investors led by Robert and John P. Birmingham. In order to acquire Steinway, the investors founded the musical conglomerate Steinway Musical Properties. In 1995, Steinway Musical Properties was acquired by Selmer Industries to form the musical conglomerate Steinway Musical Instruments.

In June 2013, private equity firm Kohlberg &amp; Company offered to buy Steinway parent company Steinway Musical Instruments for $438 million. Two months later hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co. Inc. made a higher offer, $512 million, to take the company private. The Steinway Musical Instruments board recommended that shareholders accept this, and in September 2013 Paulson announced completion of the acquisition.

===Recent history===
After the 2008 economic downturn, Steinway grand piano sales fell by half, and 30 percent of the union employees were laid off at the New York factory between August 2008 and November 2009. Sales were down 21 percent in 2009 in the United States. But sales began increasing a little in 2010, and they continued to improve the following year.

In 2015, Steinway went back to the player piano industry from around the 1920s by introducing a digital player piano series called Spirio. The technology in the Spirio pianos was created in 2007 by Wayne Stahnke, an Austrian engineer who has previously made digital player piano systems for other piano companies, like Yamaha and Bösendorfer. Wayne Stahnke&#x27;s technology, originally called &quot;Live Performance Model LX&quot;, was sold to Steinway in 2014 and re-branded as &quot;Spirio&quot;. In contrast to player pianos by other brands available at the time, a recording option was not originally available in the Steinway Spirio. In 2018, a recording option was made available in Steinway Spirio pianos, known as the Spirio &quot;r&quot;. The Spirio technology is referred to as &quot;non-parasitic&quot;, meaning that the recording and playback equipment do not interfere with the sound or feel of the piano. The pianist is recorded by over 20 grey-scale optical sensors mounted behind the piano’s keyboard. With over 1000 levels of sensitivity and the ability to record 800 measurements/second, they sense the speed at which the hammers strike the strings. In 2024, the Spirio library contained more than 4,000 recordings. 

In 2015, Steinway made its 600,000th piano. The piano features the Fibonacci spiral and Macassar ebony veneer. It took 6,000 hours of work over 4 years to make, and was priced at $2.4 million.

As of early 2021, Paulson &amp; Co. remains the ultimate parent of Steinway &amp; Sons, with head office at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020.

==Models==
Steinway pianos are sold by a worldwide network of around 200 authorized Steinway dealers who operate around 300 showrooms. The primary differentiation between Steinway models is simply their size (which is indicated by their model letter), which is also one of the most important indicators of their relative prices.

Steinway pianos are also sold in the secondary market. The price of a used Steinway can vary tremendously, depending on the model (size), age, condition, and the quality of any restoration work that has been done. Additionally, Steinway offers certified pre-owned pianos, using Steinway-approved parts.

===Grands and uprights===
Steinway makes the following models of pianos:

The Hamburg factory makes seven models of grand pianos and two upright models. (The numerical portion of each model designation represents the length of the grand pianos and the height of the upright pianos, in centimetres).

The New York factory makes six models of grand pianos and one model of upright piano. (Steinway has previously made upright pianos in different dimensions.)

===Designer cases===
Designers and artists such as Karl Lagerfeld, Dakota Jackson, Walter Dorwin Teague, Arthur Blackmore, Joseph Burr Tiffany, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, George Schastey, and the Herter Brothers have created original designs for Steinway pianos. These specially designed pianos fall under the art case piano line or the limited edition piano line.

Steinway began creating art case pianos in 1857 and the making of art case pianos reached its peak in the late 19th century. Today, Steinway only builds art case pianos on rare occasions. The art case pianos are unique. Some of Steinway&#x27;s most notable art case pianos are the &quot;Alma-Tadema grand piano&quot; from 1887, the 100,000th Steinway piano from 1903, the 300,000th Steinway piano from 1938, and the &quot;Sound of Harmony&quot; from 2008. The &quot;Alma-Tadema grand piano&quot; was designed by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema and received great public acclaim when it was exhibited in London. The piano is made of ebony, inlaid with ivory and mother of pearl, with carved case, lid, and legs, and painted in the inside lid by artist Edward Poynter. It was bought by financier Henry Gurdon Marquand for his New York City mansion. In 1997, it was sold at Christie&#x27;s auction house in London for $1.2 million, setting a price record for a piano sold at auction. It is now on display at the art museum Clark Art Institute. The 100,000th Steinway piano was given as a gift to the White House in 1903 and is made of cherry tree with gold leaf. It is decorated with coats of arms of the thirteen original states of America and painted by Thomas Dewing with dancing figures representing the nine Muses. The 100,000th Steinway piano was replaced in 1938 by the 300,000th Steinway piano. The gold gilded mahogany legs of the 300,000th piano are carved as eagles and are molded by sculptor Albert Stewart. The piano remains in use in the White House. The &quot;Sound of Harmony&quot; is decorated with inlays of 40 different woods, including the lid, which replicates artwork by Chinese painter Shi Qi. It took about four years to build the grand piano and it was priced at €1.2 million. The piano was chosen for use at the Expo 2010 Shanghai China.

Examples of limited edition pianos include &quot;The Steinway Limited Edition&quot; by Karl Lagerfeld created to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Steinway company in 2003, and the 125th-anniversary grand piano by Count Albrecht von Goertz designed to celebrate the 125th anniversary in 2005 of the founding of the Steinway factory in Hamburg, Germany.

In 1993, Steinway introduced a new line of specially designed cases, the &quot;Steinway Crown Jewel Collection&quot;. The collection consists of grand and upright pianos in Steinway&#x27;s regular models, but instead of the traditional black finish the pianos of the &quot;Steinway Crown Jewel Collection&quot; have veneers of rare woods from around the world. The collection includes Macassar ebony, East Indian rosewood, and kewazinga bubinga.

==Brands==
In addition to the &quot;Steinway &amp; Sons&quot; brand, Steinway markets two other brands: &quot;Boston&quot; for the mid-level market and &quot;Essex&quot; for the entry-level market. Boston and Essex pianos are made using lower-cost components and labor. Pianos of these two brands, made with Steinway owned designs, are manufactured in Asia by suppliers. Steinway allows only its authorized Steinway dealers to carry new Boston and Essex pianos.

* Boston: made for the general mid-ranged piano market at lower prices than Steinway&#x27;s name brand. Boston pianos are manufactured by Kawai Musical Instruments in Hamamatsu, Japan and Karawang, Indonesia. There are five sizes of Boston grand pianos and three sizes of Boston upright pianos available in a variety of finishes. Grand piano models are GP-156 PE, GP-163 PE, GP-178 PE, GP-193 PE, and GP-215 PE. Upright piano models are UP-118 PE, UP-126 PE, and UP-132 PE. Boston pianos incorporate some of the features of Steinway pianos such as a wider tail design (a feature of the Steinway piano models A-188, B-211, C-227, and D-274) resulting in a larger soundboard area than conventionally shaped pianos of comparable sizes, a maple inner rim, and Steinway&#x27;s patented Octagrip pinblock.
* Essex: made for the entry-range market and is lower priced than Steinway and Boston pianos. Since 2005, Essex pianos are made at the Pearl River piano factory in Guangzhou, China. Prior to 2005, they were made by Young Chang in Korea. There are two sizes of Essex grand pianos and four sizes of Essex upright pianos available in a wide variety of finishes and furniture designs. Grand piano models are EGP-155 and EGP-173. Upright piano models are EUP-108, EUP-111, EUP-116, and EUP-123. Like the Boston pianos, Essex pianos incorporate some of the features of Steinway pianos as well: a wider tail design, an all-wood action with Steinway geometry with rosette-shaped hammer flanges, and reinforced hammers with metal fasteners.

==Piano bank==
Steinway maintains a worldwide &quot;piano bank&quot; from which performing pianists, especially Steinway Artists, can select a Steinway piano with the touch and tonal characteristics they prefer for use in a certain concert, recording, or tour. Steinway prepares, tunes, and delivers the piano of the performer&#x27;s choice to the designated concert hall or recording studio at the performer&#x27;s expense.

The &quot;piano bank&quot; consists of approximately 250 Steinway pianos valued collectively at $12.5 million in 2019.

==Manufacture==

===German and American factories===

Some pianists and technicians have expressed a preference for pianos from Steinway&#x27;s Hamburg factory over those made in New York, or vice versa. Emanuel Ax, concert pianist and piano teacher at the Juilliard School, has said that &quot;... the differences have more to do with individual instruments than with where they were made.&quot; Larry Fine, American piano technician and author of &quot;The Piano Book&quot;, considers Hamburg Steinways to be of higher quality than those from New York. In 2010, the New York factory made some changes in its manufacturing processes and materials to improve quality, and Fine was invited to tour the factory to see some of the changes. Fine wrote in his &quot;Acoustic &amp; Digital Piano Buyer&quot; of Spring 2011 that the changes have improved the quality of the New York pianos, but that the Hamburg pianos are still of higher quality.

Steinway has two sales areas: the factory in New York supplies North and South America, and the one in Hamburg supplies the rest of the world. At all main Steinway showrooms across the world, customers can order pianos from either factory. The Hamburg and New York factories exchange parts and craftsmanship, and the parts for both factories come from the same places: Canadian maple is used for the rim, and the soundboards are made from Sitka spruce from Alaska. Both factories use similar crown parameters for their diaphragmatic soundboards. To maintain quality, Steinway has acquired some of its suppliers. Steinway bought the German manufacturer Kluge in Wuppertal, which supplies keyboards, in December 1998, and in November 1999 purchased the company that supplies its cast iron plates, O. S. Kelly Co. in Springfield, Ohio.

A majority of the world&#x27;s concert halls own at least one Steinway piano, and some (for example Carnegie Hall) have model D-274s from both the Hamburg factory and the New York factory to satisfy a greater range of preferences.

===Components===


Each Steinway grand piano has more than 12,000 individual parts. A Steinway piano is handcrafted and takes nearly a year to build.

Steinway maintains its own lumber yards at both the Hamburg and New York factories, aging and drying lumber from nine months to five years. Less than 50 percent is finally used in the making of Steinway pianos. More than 70 percent of the walnut stock is discarded. The woods are purchased when they are available rather than when they are needed.

====Rim====
The rims of Hamburg-made Steinways are made of layers of hard rock maple and mahogany; the New York-made rims use layers of hard rock maple only. The layers are glued and pressed together into one piece in one operation using rim-bending presses that C. F. Theodore Steinway invented in 1880. After the rim-bending process, the rim has to rest from the stress of being bent. It is placed in a conditioning room for a month or more to reduce the moisture content of the wood to approximately six percent.

====Plate====
Inside the piano, a cast iron plate provides the strength to support the string tension, which ranges from 16 tons to 23 tons depending on the model. The iron plate is installed above the soundboard and is bronzed, lacquered, polished, and decorated with the Steinway logo. Steinway fabricates plates in its own foundry.

====Soundboard and bridges====
Steinway makes its soundboard from solid spruce, which allows the soundboard to transmit and amplify sound. The soundboard in Steinway pianos are double-crowned with Steinway&#x27;s diaphragmatic design. The diaphragmatic soundboard, which was granted a patent in 1936, tapers in thickness from the center to the edges, which permits more freedom of movement resulting in a richer and more lasting tonal response.

Steinway bridges are made of vertically laminated hard rock maple with a hard rock maple cap. The bridges are measured for specific height requirements for each piano and are hand notched.

====Keys and action====
Steinway keys are made of Bavarian spruce. The surface of the white keys is made of polymer; earlier, they had been made of elephant ivory. Around the 1950s, Steinway switched from using ivory, and some years later use of ivory for piano keys was outlawed. The action parts are mounted on Steinway&#x27;s tubular metallic frame. The Steinway hammers are cut from virgin wool felt, containing no admixture of other materials.

In 1962, the New York factory introduced the Permafree action for its grand pianos, using Teflon parts in place of cloth bushings. Using Teflon was less expensive for the company, was intended to withstand wear and humidity changes better than cloth, and eliminated the factory&#x27;s reliance on a kind of cloth that might not be exactly the same from batch to batch. However, the Teflon bushings (which are relatively rigid and unaffected by humidity) were tightly installed inside parts made of wood, which does expand and contract according to humidity. This made the action become too tight or too loose, especially after changes in the weather, and caused annoying clicking noises while playing. The Teflon bushings were discontinued in 1983, and existing pianos that had them were retrofitted with cloth. The Hamburg factory never implemented the Teflon bushings in its pianos.

====Strings and pinblock====
The pianos have steel strings in the midsection and treble, with bass strings made of copper-wound steel. The strings are uniformly spaced with one end coiled around the tuning pins, which in turn are inserted in a laminated wooden block called the pinblock or wrestplank. The tuning pins keep the strings tight and are held in place by friction. Steinway also employs front and rear duplex scales, in which the main vibrating section of the string is augmented by a much smaller vibration in the two ends of the string which are fastened in place. Steinway was a friend of the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, and this friendship led to the development and Steinway patent in 1872 of front and back aliquots, allowing the traditionally dead sections of strings to vibrate in sympathy with the main string. The result is a fuller, more complex sound.

The pinblock, also known as wrestplank, in Steinways is made of seven layers of hard-textured wood that are glued together, set at a 45° angle to the run of the grain. It is designed to keep the piano in tune longer.

===Steinway Artists===

In contrast to other piano makers, who presented their pianos to pianists, William Steinway engaged the Russian pianist Anton Rubinstein to play Steinway pianos during Rubinstein&#x27;s first and only American concert tour from 1872 to 1873, with 215 concerts in 239 days. It was a success for both Rubinstein and Steinway. Thus, the Steinway Artist program was born. Later the Polish pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski toured America playing 107 concerts on Steinway pianos in 117 days.

, around 2,000 pianists worldwide are official &quot;Steinway Artists&quot;, which means that they have chosen to perform on Steinway pianos exclusively, and each owns a Steinway. None is paid to do so. Steinway Artists come from different genres: classical, jazz, pop, and rock. A few examples of Steinway Artists are Daniel Barenboim, Harry Connick Jr., Billy Joel, Evgeny Kissin, Diana Krall, Yundi Li and Lang Lang. Some examples of &quot;Immortal Steinway Artists&quot; are Irving Berlin, Benjamin Britten, George Gershwin, Vladimir Horowitz, Cole Porter, and Sergei Rachmaninoff.

Steinway expects Steinway Artists to perform on Steinway pianos where they are available and in appropriate condition. Artur Schnabel complained once that &quot;Steinway refused to let me use their pianos [i.e., Steinway pianos owned by Steinway] unless I would give up playing the Bechstein piano – which I had used for so many years – in Europe. They insisted that I play on Steinway exclusively, everywhere in the world, otherwise they would not give me their pianos in the United States. That is the reason why from 1923 until 1930 I did not return to America. ... [in] 1933, Steinway changed their attitude and agreed to let me use their pianos in the United States, even if I continued elsewhere to play the Bechstein piano ... Thus, from 1933 on, I went every year to America.&quot; In 1972, Steinway responded to Garrick Ohlsson&#x27;s statement that Bösendorfer was &quot;the Rolls-Royce of pianos&quot; by trucking away the Steinway-owned grand piano that Ohlsson was about to give a recital on at Alice Tully Hall in New York City. Ohlsson ended up performing on a Bösendorfer piano borrowed at the eleventh hour, and Steinway would not let him borrow Steinway-owned pianos for some time. Ohlsson has since made peace with Steinway. Angela Hewitt was removed from the Steinway Artist roster around 2002 after she purchased and performed on a Fazioli piano. After the Canadian pianist Louis Lortie was removed from the Steinway Artist roster in 2003, he complained in a newspaper article that Steinway is trying to establish a monopoly on the concert world by becoming &quot;the Microsoft of pianos&quot;. A Steinway spokesman said, in response to Lortie&#x27;s decision to perform a concert on a Fazioli piano, that Steinway does not want anyone on the Steinway Artist roster who does not want to play the Steinway exclusively.

According to musicologist Stuart de Ocampo, &quot;That Steinway aggressively sought out and paid (in various forms) for artist endorsements must be stressed in order to combat an idealistic notion that the greatest flocked to Steinway simply because it was the best.&quot; More generally, Stuart de Ocampo endorses the view of Donald W. Fostle, who wrote in a company history of Steinway that &quot;the genius of Steinways ... ultimately lay in their ability to persuade millions of persons across decades and continents that in this realm of supreme subjectivity, individual variation, incertitude, and ever-changing conditions, there was an absolute best. The assertion, repeated often enough, took on the coloration of fact&quot;, but Stuart de Ocampo concludes that &quot;Innovations in piano construction carved out a unique sound for the Steinway pianos in the mid-nineteenth century. Medals at fairs and international exhibitions were the basis of Steinway &amp; Sons&#x27; early reputation.&quot; Paying for pianists&#x27; endorsements back then was not specific to Steinway. As there were financial incentives for testimonials, several famous pianists had no qualms about endorsing more than one piano brand. Franz Liszt endorsed Steinway, Bösendorfer, Chickering, Erard, Ibach, Mason &amp; Risch, and Steck at the same time. Today, no pianist is paid by Steinway, and when Steinway Artists loan pianos from Steinway for a concert or recording session the artists do have to pay Steinway for preparing, tuning, and delivering of the piano. According to management academic David Liebeskind, the Steinway Artist program &quot;... is one of the only pure product endorsements programs, as no artist is paid to play on or endorse a Steinway piano.&quot;

The Steinway Artist program has been copied by other piano companies, but Steinway&#x27;s program is unique in that a pianist must promise to play pianos of the Steinway brand &quot;only&quot;. The Steinway Artist designation restricts a pianist&#x27;s use of pianos by other makers and implies an obligation to perform on Steinway pianos.

===All-Steinway Schools===
The All-Steinway School designation is given by Steinway to educational institutions of music in which not less than 90 percent of the pianos are designed by Steinway. Steinway does not offer the pianos free of charge but requires that the institutions buy them. Performance venues, teaching studios, and practice rooms for piano students must be equipped with Steinway pianos. Teaching studios and practice rooms for other students may be equipped with Boston or Essex pianos; some All-Steinway Schools have chosen to have Steinway pianos in these rooms also. It is required that the pianos are kept in performance-quality condition and All-Steinway Schools must have piano technicians that participate in Steinway&#x27;s technical training programs. If the pianos are not maintained in performance-quality condition, Steinway can withdraw the All-Steinway School designation.

The Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio holds the longest partnership with Steinway. They have used Steinway pianos exclusively since 1877, 24 years after Steinway was founded. In 2007, they obtained their 200th Steinway piano, a model D-274 manufactured at Steinway&#x27;s factory in Hamburg, Germany. Other examples of All-Steinway Schools are the Yale School of Music at Yale University in Connecticut, the Curtis Institute of Music in Pennsylvania, Royal Holloway, University of London, the University of Melbourne Faculty of VCA and MCM in Australia, and the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing.

In 2007, the Crane School of Music in Potsdam, New York, was added to the All-Steinway School roster, receiving 141 pianos in one $3.8 million order. In 2009, the University of Cincinnati – College-Conservatory of Music in Ohio became designated an All-Steinway School, based on a $4.1 million order of 165 new pianos, one of the largest orders Steinway has ever processed.

, there are approximately 200 All-Steinway Schools around the world.

===Piano competitions===
Several international piano competitions use Steinway pianos. Since the Cleveland International Piano Competition chose to use only Steinway pianos in 1999, Steinway has been selected exclusively by such competitions as the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in Fort Worth, Texas, the Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition in Salt Lake City, Utah, the International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition in Leipzig, Germany, the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels, Belgium, the Ferruccio Busoni International Piano Competition in Bolzano, Italy, and the Long-Thibaud-Crespin Competition in Paris.

==Awards==
The Steinway company and its leaders have won numerous awards, including:
* In 1839, Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg exhibited three pianos at the state trade exhibition in Braunschweig, Germany, and was awarded a gold medal.
* In 1855, Steinway attended the Metropolitan Mechanics Institute fair in Washington, D.C. and won 1st prize.
* In 1855, Steinway exhibited at the American Institute Fair in the New York Crystal Palace in what is now Bryant Park in New York City. Steinway won a gold medal. A reporter wrote the following about Steinway: &quot;Their square pianos are characterized by the great power of tone, depth and richness in the bass, a full mellowness in the middle register and brilliant purity in the treble, making a scale perfectly equal and singularly melodious throughout its entire range. In touch, they are all that could be desired.&quot;
* From 1855 to 1862, Steinway pianos received 35 medals in the United States alone, since which time Steinway entered their pianos at international exhibitions only.
* In 1862, for the International Exhibition in London, Steinway shipped two square pianos and two grand pianos to England (two to Liverpool and two to London) and won 1st prize.
* In 1867, Steinway won three awards at the International Exposition in Paris: the Grand Gold Medal of Honor, the Grand Annual Testimonial Medal, and honorary membership of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. These awards won in Europe increased the demand for Steinway pianos, thus the reason the family looked into opening a store in London. The International Exposition of 1867 established Steinway as the leading choice for pianos in Europe.
* In 1876, at the Centennial Exposition in the United States, Steinway received the two highest awards and a certificate of the judges showing a rating of 95.5 of a possible 96.
* In 1885, Steinway received the gold medal at the International Inventions Exhibition in London and the grand gold medal of the Royal Society of Arts in London.
* In 2007, the National Medal of Arts was awarded to Henry Z. Steinway and presented by US President George W. Bush in an East Room ceremony at the White House. Henry Z. Steinway received the award for &quot;... his devotion to preserving and promoting quality craftsmanship and performance, as an arts patron and advocate for music and music education; and for continuing the fine tradition of the Steinway piano...&quot;
* In 2014, Steinway received the Red Dot product design award for the &quot;Arabesque&quot; limited edition grand piano. The jury wrote: &quot;The design of the Arabesque impresses through elegance and individuality. It thus excellently complements the high-class product line of this renowned manufacturing house.&quot;

==Patented inventions==

Steinway has been granted 139 patents in piano making; the first in 1857. Some examples of these are:
* Patent No. 26,532 (December 20, 1859): The bass strings are &quot;overstrung&quot; above the treble strings to provide more length and better tonal quality. The invention won 1st prize medal at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. Today, the invention is a standard feature of grand piano construction.
* Patent No. 126,848 (May 14, 1872): Steinway invented the duplex scale on the principle of enabling the freely oscillating parts of the string, directly in front of and behind the segment of the string actually struck, also to resound. The outcome is a large range and fullness of overtones – one of the characteristics of the Steinway sound.
* Patent No. 127,383 (May 28, 1872): In a Steinway piano, the cast iron plate rests on wooden dowels without actually touching the soundboard. It is lightly curved, creating a large hollow between the plate and the soundboard. This cavity acts as a reinforcement of the resonant properties.
* Patent No. 156,388 (October 27, 1874): Steinway claims the invention of the middle piano pedal. The sostenuto pedal gives the pianist an ability to create what is called an organ pedal point by keeping a specific note&#x27;s damper, or notes&#x27; dampers, in their open position(s), allowing those strings to continue to sound while other notes can be played without continuing to resonate. The sostenuto pedal was previously perfected, with a patent application, by M. Waldo Hanchett of Syracuse, New York. However, Steinway succeeded in patenting the device, despite Hanchett&#x27;s five-months-old application. 

* Patent No. 170,645 (November 30, 1875): Steinway&#x27;s &quot;Regulation Action Pilot&quot;, also known as &quot;Capstan Screw&quot;, lifts the parts that drive the hammer toward the string. The Steinway device was easily adjustable, but more importantly allowed the action to be quickly separated from the keys, an advance that greatly simplified servicing the piano. 
* Patent No. 233,710 (October 26, 1880): The bridge transmits the vibration of the strings to the soundboard. In a Steinway piano, the bridge consists of vertically glued laminations in a quartersawn orientation. With this continuity of grain, the sound traverses the bridge along its entire length, a principle that ensures that vibrations are easily developed and forwarded.
* Patent No. 314,742 (March 31, 1885): The rims of Hamburg-made Steinways are made of layers of hard rock maple and mahogany; the New York-made rims use layers of hard rock maple only. The layers are glued and pressed together into one piece in one operation.
* Patent No. 2,051,633 (August 18, 1936): The soundboard resembles a membrane. The special molding, gradually tapering from the center to the edge, provides great flexibility and freer vibration across the board.
* Patent No. 3,091,149 (May 28, 1963): A pinblock designed to keep the piano in tune longer. Seven layers of hard maple are glued together, each successive layer at a 45° angle to the one before it.

<text>Vincent Richard Impellitteri (born Vincenzo Impellitteri; February 4, 1900 – January 29, 1987) was an Italian-American politician and judge who served as the 101st Mayor of New York City from 1950 to 1953. He was elected as a Democrat and president of the City Council in 1945 and reelected in 1949. When Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer resigned in 1950, he became acting mayor. He lost the Democratic primary for the nomination for the rest of the term but was subsequently elected mayor on a new ticket, the &quot;Experience Party&quot;. He lost the Democratic primary when he ran for a full term in 1953 and became a judge in 1954.

==Early life==
Born Vincenzo Impellitteri in Isnello, Sicily, he moved with his family to the United States as an infant in 1901. They settled in Ansonia, Connecticut, where Impellitteri spent most of his youth. He was a Catholic. He enlisted in the United States Navy for World War I. He served as a radioman with the rank of petty officer third class on board the destroyer USS &quot;Stockton&quot;, which was based in Queenstown, Ireland, and performed convoy escort and antisubmarine duty. He left the Navy after the war and became a U.S. citizen in 1922. After that, Impellitteri attended the Fordham University School of Law (where he received his LL.B. in 1924) while working successively as a night bellboy and manager at a Broadway hotel. He married Elizabeth (Betty) Agnes McLaughlin in 1926.

==Start of career==
Following his admission to the bar, he worked in private practice alongside influential Democratic attorney Martin Thomas Conboy Jr. He served as a state Assistant District Attorney from 1929 to 1938. After returning to private practice for three years as a specialist in criminal law, he served as legal secretary to New York Supreme Court Justice Peter Schmuck, later moving to the chambers of Joseph A. Gavagan in an analogous role. He was reportedly a close associate of gangster Tommy Lucchese, who helped Impellitteri&#x27;s rise in politics. On the other hand, a report in the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; indicated that Impelliteri opposed organized crime and corruption and had failed to rise through the city Democratic Party&#x27;s ranks because he had &quot;the injudicious good taste to snub Frank Costello&quot;, the gambler and racketeer who was said to control the Tammany Hall organization behind the scenes.

In 1945, Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer picked Impellitteri to run for President of the City Council on the Tammany Hall slate. He ran on the Democratic and American Labor Party lines in 1945, but when he was up for reelection in 1949, he ran on the Democratic Party line alone.

According to historian Robert Caro, Impelliteri was drafted into his first elected role by Democratic Party leadership, who selected his name from a municipal employee directory. The party was seeking an Italian American Manhattan resident to bring balance to the citywide ticket and thought an employee in his position would be easy to persuade on political matters.

==Mayor of New York City==
On August 31, 1950, O&#x27;Dwyer, pursued by both federal and state investigators, was suddenly appointed by President Harry S. Truman as United States ambassador to Mexico, where he would be beyond the reach of officials who wanted his public testimony in several matters on which he preferred not to speak. Under the City Charter of the era, City Council President Impellitteri became acting mayor upon O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s resignation. The Tammany Hall bosses determined that Impellitteri was unsuitable for the role and refused to nominate him as the Democratic candidate for the special election in November 1950; instead, highly regarded New York State Supreme Court Judge Ferdinand Pecora, who was also given the Liberal Party line, ran as the nominee. Impellitteri ignored the machine and ran independently under the new &quot;Experience Party&quot; banner. He also popularized the slogan &quot;unbought and unbossed&quot; during his 1950 campaign.

Impellitteri was the first mayor since the consolidation of greater New York in 1898 who was elected without a major party&#x27;s ballot line, and his election was a populist uprising against the political system. The results were:

* Vincent Impellitteri (Experience Party) 1,161,175 votes
* Ferdinand Pecora (Democratic/Liberal) 935,351
* Edward Corsi (Republican) 382,372
* Paul L. Ross (American Labor) 147,578

Impellitteri&#x27;s inauguration, held on November 14, 1950, absent either a band or a platform, was swift and straightforward. Outside City Hall, he pledged to &quot;do my level best to justify the confidence you have reposed in me.&quot;

Shortly after Impellitteri&#x27;s succession, the Kings County District Attorney arrested bookmaker Harry Gross in September 1950 as part of a corruption investigation that caused nearly 500 police officers of all ranks to resign, retire, or be fired. Impellitteri opposed the corruption, vigorously supporting the Brooklyn District Attorney, Miles McDonald, and firing anyone in his administration associated with former Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer.
Impellitteri is credited with trying to rein in the budget, raising the bus and subway fare to fifteen cents, establishing parking meters on city streets for enhanced revenue, and increasing the sales tax. He aspired to be a new light in city politics, but his administration met with some resistance from the established order. At the time, Robert Moses wielded significant influence; according to Robert Caro (in his Moses biography &quot;The Power Broker&quot;), Impellitteri deferred to Moses on all matters of appointments and policy and is described as a puppet on Robert Moses&#x27; strings. The Italian author Carlo Levi documented the mayor&#x27;s 1950 visit to his birthplace in Sicily. 

Impellitteri ran for a full term in 1953. He was defeated in the Democratic primary by then Manhattan Borough President Robert F. Wagner, Jr. Although New York City Comptroller Lazarus Joseph usually sided in the New York City Board of Estimate with Impellitteri during the latter&#x27;s term in office, Joseph supported Wagner for the Democratic nomination.

==Later career and retirement==
After becoming mayor, Wagner appointed Impelliteri a New York City Criminal Court judge. He retired from the bench in 1965. Following the death of his wife in 1967, he lived at the New York Athletic Club&#x27;s City House on Central Park South. After he was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1983, he maintained his Athletic Club residence but primarily resided in convalescent homes, most notably the Carolton Convalescent Hospital in Fairfield, Connecticut.

==Philanthropy==
Impelliteri became a patron of The Lambs Club in 1949.

==Death and burial==
He died of heart failure on January 29, 1987, at Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Impellitteri was buried at Mount Saint Peter Catholic Cemetery in Derby, Connecticut.

<doc id="51965" wikidata="Q204135" url="?curid=51965" title="Jimmy Walker">
<text>James John Walker (June 19, 1881November 18, 1946), known colloquially as Beau James, was an American attorney, lyricist, and Democratic Party politician who served as the 97th mayor of New York City from 1926 until his resignation in 1932. A flamboyant politician, he was a liberal Democrat and part of the powerful Tammany Hall machine. He was forced to resign during a corruption scandal in which he accepted large sums of money in exchange for municipal contracts.

==Early life and political career==
Walker was the son of Irish-born William H. Walker (1842–1916), a carpenter and lumberyard owner who was very active in local politics as a Democratic assemblyman and alderman from Greenwich Village, belying certain accounts of Walker&#x27;s childhood that stated he grew up in poverty. Walker was not the best student and dropped out of college, eventually graduating from New York Law School in 1904. Walker&#x27;s father wanted him to become a lawyer and politician, but he decided that he would rather write songs and be involved in the music industry. He wrote the lyrics for a 1906 hit, &quot;Will You Love Me in December as You Do in May?&quot; with songwriter Ernest Ball. Walker entered politics in 1909 and subsequently passed the bar exam in 1912.

Walker was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 5th D.) in 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913 and 1914. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1915 to 1925, sitting in the 138th, 139th, 140th, 141st (all four 13th D.), 142nd, 143rd, 144th, 145th, 146th, 147th and 148th New York State Legislatures (all seven 12th D.); and was Minority Leader from 1920 to 1922; Temporary President of the State Senate from 1923 to 1924; and Minority Leader again in 1925. In the Senate he strongly opposed Prohibition.
During his tenure as Temporary President of the State Senate, Walker was often seen on the floor accompanied by reformist activist, future urban planner, and key Al Smith ally Robert Moses. Moses, without an official position and therefore forced to kneel beside Walker&#x27;s desk rather than sit in a chair, acted sort of as an advisor for Walker. He provided Walker with arguments and facts to be used against Republican adversaries on issues that, according to author Robert Caro, &quot;Walker had no patience to master.&quot; Moses also delivered messages to Walker on Governor Smith&#x27;s behalf.

Walker was elegant and witty, but he was also willing to take down his opponents with no mercy. Ellwood Rabenold was a reformist elected to the State Senate as a Democrat. He was independent-minded and put the party&#x27;s one-vote majority in 1923 in jeopardy. When Rabenold refused to support a bill that Democrats considered vital and then attacked Walker&#x27;s character, Walker pledged he would &quot;ruin&quot; Rabenold and dedicated the rest of the term to forcing Rabenold out of politics. Walker would eventually succeed, showing no remorse for destroying his career.

==Running for mayor, 1925==
After his years in the Senate, Walker set his sights on the 1925 election for Mayor of New York. Beginning with the 1925 Democratic primary for mayor, Walker knew that to ultimately win the mayoral election he had to defeat the mayor, John Francis Hylan. Walker&#x27;s reputation as a flamboyant man-about-town made him a hero to many working-class voters; he was often seen at legitimate theaters and illegitimate speakeasies. Walker was a clothes horse: his valet packed 43 suits for his trip to Europe in August 1927. On the other hand, his reputation for tolerating corruption made him suspect to middle-class and moralistic voters. Governor Alfred E. Smith was his mentor. Smith was a staunch supporter since Walker backed many social and cultural issues that were considered politically important, such as social welfare legislation, legalization of boxing, repeal of blue laws against Sunday baseball games, and condemning the Ku Klux Klan. Their mutual opposition to Prohibition was especially important in their political relationship.

Smith knew the secret to how Walker could win the mayoral race and overcome his tarnished reputation was for Smith to guide Walker&#x27;s every move. Smith used his base in the strong political machine of Tammany Hall to secure victory. Finally, Walker himself had to be willing to change some of his more unscrupulous ways or at least provide a cover for his indiscretions. As with many things in Walker&#x27;s life, he chose the latter. Instead of ending his visits to speakeasies and his friendships with chorus girls, he took those activities behind the closed doors of a penthouse funded by Tammany Hall.

Walker defeated Hylan in the Democratic primary, and after defeating Republican mayoral candidate Frank D. Waterman in the general election he became mayor of New York.

==Mayor, 1926–1932==

In his initial years as mayor, Walker saw the city prosper and many public works projects gain traction. In his first year, Walker created the Department of Sanitation, unified New York&#x27;s public hospitals, improved many parks and playgrounds, and guided the Board of Transportation to enter into contract for the construction of an expanded subway system (the Independent Subway System or IND). Under Walker&#x27;s administration, new highways and a dock for superliners were also built. He even managed to maintain the five-cent subway fare despite a threatened strike by the workers.

Walker&#x27;s term was also known for the proliferation of speakeasies during Prohibition. It is a noted aspect of his career as mayor and as a member of the State Senate that Walker was strongly opposed to Prohibition. As mayor, Walker led his administration in challenging the Eighteenth Amendment by replacing the police commissioner with an inexperienced former state banking commissioner. The new police commissioner immediately dissolved the Special Service Squad. Since Walker did not feel that drinking was a crime, he discouraged the police from enforcing Prohibition law or taking an active role unless it was to curb excessive violations or would prove to be newsworthy. His affairs with &quot;chorus girls&quot; were widely known, and he left his wife, Janet, for showgirl Betty Compton. The first U.S. arrival in New York City of the best known Anastasia Romanov impostor, Anna Anderson, in 1928 and the eventual public denial of her by the exiled Romanovs and return to Germany in 1931 also occurred during Walker&#x27;s mayoralty.

Walker was re-elected by an overwhelming margin in 1929, defeating Republican Fiorello H. La Guardia and Socialist Norman Thomas. Walker&#x27;s fortunes turned downward with the economy after the stock-market crash of 1929. Patrick Joseph Hayes, the Cardinal Archbishop of New York, denounced him, implying that the immorality of the mayor, both personal and political in tolerating &quot;girlie magazines&quot; and casinos, was a cause of the economic downturn. It was one of the causes that led to Tammany Hall&#x27;s pulling its support for Walker. Walker&#x27;s image was further solidified by quotes like &quot;A reformer is a guy who rides through a sewer in a glass-bottomed boat.&quot;

Walker endorsed Al Smith for the Democratic nomination during the 1932 presidential election.

==Scandal and resignation==

Increasing social unrest led to investigations into corruption within Walker&#x27;s administration, and he was eventually forced to testify before the investigative committee of Judge Samuel Seabury, the Seabury Commission (also known as the Hofstadter Committee). Walker caused his own downfall by accepting large sums of money from businessmen looking for municipal contracts.

One surprise witness in the Seabury investigation was Vivian Gordon. She informed the investigators that women were falsely arrested and accused of prostitution by the New York City Police Department. Police officers were given more money in their paychecks. After her testimony, Gordon was suspiciously found strangled in a park in the Bronx. The incident demonstrated to New Yorkers that corruption could lead to terrible consequences, and led to suspicion that Walker might ultimately, in some way, have been responsible for her death.

With New York City appearing as a symbol of corruption under Mayor Walker, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt knew he had to do something about Walker and his administration. Knowing that the state constitution could allow an elected mayor to be removed from office, Roosevelt felt compelled to do so but risked losing Tammany Hall&#x27;s support for the Democratic nomination for president. On the other hand, if Roosevelt did nothing or let Walker off, the national newspapers would consider him weak.

Facing pressure from Roosevelt, Walker eluded questions about his personal bank accounts, stating instead that the amounts he received were &quot;beneficences&quot; and not bribes. He delayed any personal appearances until after Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination was secured. It was then that the embattled mayor could fight no longer. Months from his national election, Roosevelt decided that he must remove Walker from office. Walker agreed and resigned on September 1, 1932. He went on a grand tour of Europe with Compton, his Ziegfeld girl. He announced on November 12, 1932, while aboard the SS &quot;Conte Grande&quot;, that he had &quot;no desire or intention of ever holding public office again.&quot; Walker stayed in Europe until the danger of criminal prosecution appeared remote. There, he married Compton while in Cannes, France.

==Later life and legacy==
After his return to the United States, Walker acted as head of Majestic Records, which included such popular performing artists as Louis Prima and Bud Freeman. He and Compton would adopt two children, Mary Ann Walker and James J. Walker. In 1940 he had his own radio series on WHN, &quot;Jimmy Walker&#x27;s Opportunity Hour&quot;, with Henry Gladstone serving as announcer. The same year, Compton began divorce action against Walker, with the divorce becoming official on March 15, 1941. He died on November 18, 1946 at the age of 65 of a brain hemorrhage. He was interred in the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.

When Walker was a member of the New York State Senate, he sponsored the &quot;Walker Law&quot; to legalize boxing in New York. He was honored a number of times over the years by the boxing community. Walker is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame and was given the Edward J. Neil Trophy in 1945 for his service to the sport.

He also spent many summers in Atlantic Beach, New York, sometimes during his term as mayor, and afterward, for he was friends with its founder, William Austin.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Walker as the third-worst American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

==In popular culture==
A romanticized version of Walker&#x27;s tenure as mayor was presented in the 1957 film &quot;Beau James&quot;, starring Bob Hope. This was a somewhat accurate depiction of Walker, who during his time as mayor had become a symbol of the jazz age romanticism. The film was based on a biography of Walker, also titled &quot;Beau James&quot;, written by Gene Fowler. A song by Dean Martin, similarly titled &quot;Beau James&quot;, presented a highly idealized and romantic interpretation of his tenure as mayor. A book was also the basis of &quot;Jimmy&quot;, a stage musical about Walker that had a brief Broadway run from October 1969 to January 1970. The show starred Frank Gorshin as Walker and Anita Gillette as Betty Compton. There is also a song about Walker in the stage musical &quot;Fiorello!&quot;, &quot;Gentleman Jimmy&quot;.

<doc id="51970" wikidata="Q192296" url="?curid=51970" title="Weaving">
<text>Weaving is a method of textile production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth. Other methods are knitting, crocheting, felting, and braiding or plaiting. The longitudinal threads are called the warp and the lateral threads are the weft, woof, or filling. The method in which these threads are interwoven affects the characteristics of the cloth.
Cloth is usually woven on a loom, a device that holds warp threads in place while filling threads are woven through them. A fabric band that meets this definition of cloth (warp threads with a weft thread winding between) can also be made using other methods, including tablet weaving, back strap loom, or other techniques that can be done without looms.

The way the warp and filling threads interlace with each other is called the weave. The majority of woven products are created with one of three basic weaves: plain weave, satin weave, or twill weave. Woven cloth can be plain or classic (in one colour or a simple pattern), or can be woven in decorative or artistic design.

==Process and terminology==
In general, weaving involves using a loom to interlace two sets of threads at right angles to each other: the warp which runs longitudinally and the weft (older &quot;woof&quot;) that crosses it. ( is an Old English word meaning &quot;that which is woven&quot;; compare &quot;leave&quot; and &quot;left&quot;.) One warp thread is called an &quot;end&quot; and one weft thread is called a &quot;pick&quot;. The warp threads are held taut and in parallel to each other, typically in a loom. There are many types of looms.

Weaving can be summarized as a repetition of these three actions, also called the &quot;primary motions of the loom&quot;.
* Shedding: where the warp threads (ends) are separated by raising or lowering heald frames (heddles) to form a clear space, referred to as the shed where the pick can pass
* Picking: where the weft or pick is propelled across the loom by hand, an air-jet, a rapier or a shuttle
* Beating-up or battening: where the weft is pushed up against the fell of the cloth by the reed

The warp is divided into two overlapping groups, or lines (most often adjacent threads belonging to the opposite group) that run in two planes, one above another, so the shuttle can be passed between them in a straight motion. Then, the upper group is lowered by the loom mechanism, and the lower group is raised (shedding), allowing the shuttle to pass in the opposite direction, also in a straight motion. Repeating these actions forms a fabric mesh but without beating-up, the final distance between the adjacent wefts would be irregular and far too large.

The &quot;secondary motions of the loom&quot; are the:
* Let off motion: where the warp is let off the warp beam at a regulated speed to make the filling even and of the required design
* Take up motion: takes up the woven fabric in a regulated manner so that the density of filling is maintained

The &quot;tertiary motions of the loom&quot; are the stop motions: to stop the loom in the event of a thread break. The two main stop motions are the
* Warp stop motion
* Weft stop motion

The principal parts of a loom are the frame, the warp-beam or weavers beam, the cloth-roll (apron bar), the heddles, and their mounting, the reed. The warp-beam is a wooden or metal cylinder on the back of the loom on which the warp is delivered. The threads of the warp extend in parallel order from the warp-beam to the front of the loom where they are attached to the cloth-roll. Each thread or group of threads of the warp passes through an opening (eye) in a heddle. The warp threads are separated by the heddles into two or more groups, each controlled and automatically drawn up and down by the motion of the heddles. In the case of small patterns the movement of the heddles is controlled by &quot;cams&quot; which move up the heddles by means of a frame called a harness; in larger patterns the heddles are controlled by a dobby mechanism, where the healds are raised according to pegs inserted into a revolving drum. Where a complex design is required, the healds are raised by harness cords attached to a Jacquard machine. Every time the harness (the heddles) moves up or down, an opening (shed) is made between the threads of warp, through which the pick is inserted. Traditionally the weft thread is inserted by a shuttle.

On a conventional loom, continuous weft thread is carried on a pirn, in a shuttle that passes through the shed. A handloom weaver could propel the shuttle by throwing it from side to side with the aid of a picking stick. The &quot;picking&quot; on a power loom is done by rapidly hitting the shuttle from each side using an overpick or underpick mechanism controlled by cams 80–250 times a minute. When a pirn is depleted, it is ejected from the shuttle and replaced with the next pirn held in a battery attached to the loom. Multiple shuttle boxes allow more than one shuttle to be used. Each can carry a different colour which allows banding across the loom.
The rapier-type weaving machines do not have shuttles, they propel cut lengths of weft by means of small grippers or rapiers that pick up the filling thread and carry it halfway across the loom where another rapier picks it up and pulls it the rest of the way. Some carry the filling yarns across the loom at rates in excess of 2,000 metres per minute. Manufacturers such as Picanol have reduced the mechanical adjustments to a minimum, and control all the functions through a computer with a graphical user interface. Other types use compressed air to insert the pick. They are all fast, versatile and quiet.

The warp is sized in a starch mixture for smoother running. The loom warped (loomed or dressed) by passing the sized warp threads through two or more heddles attached to harnesses. The power weavers loom is warped by separate workers. Most looms used for industrial purposes have a machine that ties new warps threads to the waste of previously used warps threads, while still on the loom, then an operator rolls the old and new threads back on the warp beam. The harnesses are controlled by cams, dobbies or a Jacquard head.
The raising and lowering sequence of warp threads in various sequences gives rise to many possible weave structures:
* Plain weave: plain, and hopsacks, poplin, taffeta, poult-de-soie, pibiones and grosgrain
* Twill weave: these are described by weft float followed by warp float, arranged to give diagonal pattern; examples are 2/1 twill, 3/3 twill, or 1/2 twill. These are softer fabrics than plain weaves.
* Satin weave: satins and sateens
* Complex computer-generated interlacings, such as Jacquard fabric
* Pile fabrics: fabrics with a surface of cut threads (a &quot;pile&quot;), such as velvets and velveteens
*Selvage refers to the fabric&#x27;s edge, which may be marked with the manufacturer&#x27;s detail. It is a narrow edge of a woven fabric parallel to its length.
*Thrums are the remainder yarns for tying on the loom. The portion that is not weavable warp. It is also called loom waste.

Both warp and weft can be visible in the final product. By spacing the warp more closely, it can completely cover the weft that binds it, giving a &quot;warp faced&quot; textile such as rep weave. Conversely, if the warp is spread out, the weft can slide down and completely cover the warp, giving a &quot;weft faced&quot; textile, such as a tapestry or a Kilim rug. There are a variety of loom styles for hand weaving and tapestry.

==Archaeology==
There are some indications that weaving was already known in the Paleolithic Era, as early as 27,000 years ago. An indistinct textile impression has been found at the Dolní Věstonice site. According to the find, the weavers of the Upper Palaeolithic were manufacturing a variety of cordage types, produced plaited basketry and sophisticated twined and plain woven cloth. The artifacts include imprints in clay and burned remnants of cloth.

The oldest known textiles found in the Americas are remnants of six finely woven textiles and cordage found in Guitarrero Cave, Peru. The weavings, made from plant fibres, are dated between 10,100 and 9080 BCE.

In 2013 a piece of cloth woven from hemp was found in burial F. 7121 at the Çatalhöyük site, suggested to be from around 7000 BCE Further finds come from the Neolithic civilisation preserved in the pile dwellings in Switzerland.

Another extant fragment from the Neolithic was found in Fayum, at a site dated to about 5000 BCE. This fragment is woven at about 12 threads by 9 threads per centimetre in a plain weave. Flax was the predominant fibre in Egypt at this time (3600 BCE) and had continued popularity in the Nile Valley, though wool became the primary fibre used in other cultures around 2000 BCE.

The oldest-known weavings in North America come from the Windover Archaeological Site in Florida. Dating from 4900 to 6500 BCE and made from plant fibres, the Windover hunter-gatherers produced &quot;finely crafted&quot; twined and plain weave textiles. Eighty-seven pieces of fabric were found associated with 37 burials. Researchers have identified seven different weaves in the fabric. One kind of fabric had 26 strands per inch (10 strands per centimetre). There were also weaves using two-strand and three-strand wefts. A round bag made from twine was found, as well as matting. The yarn was probably made from palm leaves. Cabbage palm, saw palmetto and scrub palmetto are all common in the area, and would have been so 8,000 years ago.

Evidence of weaving as a commercial household industry in the historical region of Macedonia has been found at the Olynthus site. When the city was destroyed by Philip II in 348 BCE, artifacts were preserved in the houses. Loomweights were found in many houses, enough to produce cloth to meet the needs of the household, but some of the houses contained more loomweights, enough for commercial production, and one of the houses was adjacent to the &quot;agora&quot; and contained three shops where many coins were found. It is probable that such homes were engaged in commercial textile manufacture.

==History==

Weaving was known in all the great civilisations, but no clear line of causality has been established. Early looms required two people to create the shed and one person to pass through the filling. Early looms wove a fixed length of cloth, but later ones allowed warp to be wound out as the fell progressed. Weaving became simpler when the warp was sized.

===Africa===
Around the 4th century BCE , the cultivation of cotton and the knowledge of its spinning and weaving in Meroë reached a high level. Export of textiles was one of the main sources of wealth for Kush. Aksumite King Ezana boasted in his inscription that he destroyed large cotton plantations in Meroë during his conquest of the region.

===Latin America===


The Indigenous people of the Americas wove textiles of cotton throughout tropical and subtropical America and in the South American Andes of wool from camelids, primarily domesticated llamas and alpacas. Cotton and the camelids were both domesticated by about 4,000 BCE. American weavers are &quot;credited with independently inventing nearly every non-mechanized technique known today.&quot;

In the Inca Empire of the Andes, both men and women produced textiles. Women mostly did their weaving using backstrap looms to make small pieces of cloth and vertical frame and single-heddle looms for larger pieces. Men used upright looms. The Inca elite valued &quot;cumbi&quot;, which was a fine tapestry-woven textile produced on upright looms. The elite often offered as gifts of reciprocity to lords (other elite) in the Empire. In regions under direct control of the Inca, special artisans produced &quot;cumbi&quot; for the elite. Women who created &quot;cumbi&quot; in these regions were called &quot;acllas&quot; or &quot;mamaconas&quot; and men were called &quot;cumbicamayos&quot;. Andean textile weavings were of practical, symbolic, religious, and ceremonial importance and used as currency, tribute, and as a determinant of social class and rank. Sixteenth-century Spanish colonists were impressed by both the quality and quantity of textiles produced by the Inca Empire. Some of the techniques and designs are still in use in the 21st century.

Whereas European cloth-making generally created ornamentation through &quot;suprastructural&quot; means—by adding embroidery, ribbons, brocade, dyeing, and other elements onto the finished woven textile—pre-Columbian Andean weavers created elaborate cloth by focusing on &quot;structural&quot; designs involving manipulation of the warp and weft of the fabric itself. Andeans used &quot;tapestry techniques; double-, triple- and quadruple-cloth techniques; gauze weaves; warp-patterned weaves; discontinuous warp or scaffold weaves; and plain weaves&quot; among many other techniques, in addition to the suprastructural techniques listed above.

===East Asia===

The weaving of silk from silkworm cocoons has been known in China since about 3500 BCE. Silk that was intricately woven and dyed, showing a well developed craft, has been found in a Chinese tomb dating back to 2700 BCE.

Silk weaving in China was an intricate process that was very involved. Men and women, usually from the same family, had their own roles in the weaving process. The actual work of weaving was done by both men and women. Women were often weavers since it was a way they could contribute to the household income while staying at home. Women would usually weave simpler designs within the household while men would be in charge of the weaving of more intricate and complex pieces of clothing. The process of sericulture and weaving emphasized the idea that men and women should work together instead of women being subordinate to men. Weaving became an integral part of Chinese women&#x27;s social identity. Several rituals and myths were associated with the promotion of silk weaving, especially as a symbol of female power. Weaving contributed to the balance between men and women&#x27;s economic contributions and had many economic benefits.

There were many paths into the occupation of weaver. Women usually married into the occupation, belonged to a family of weavers and or lived in a location that had ample weather conditions that allowed for the process of silk weaving. Weavers usually belonged to the peasant class. Silk weaving became a specialized job requiring specific technology and equipment that was completed domestically within households. Although most of the silk weaving was done within the confines of the home and family, there were some specialized workshops that hired skilled silk weavers as well. These workshops took care of the weaving process, although the raising of the silkworms and reeling of the silk remained work for peasant families. The silk that was woven in workshops rather than homes were of higher quality, since the workshop could afford to hire the best weavers. These weavers were usually men who operated more complicated looms, such as the wooden draw-loom. This created a competitive market of silk weavers.

The quality and ease of the weaving process depended on the silk that was produced by the silk worms. The easiest silk to work with came from breeds of silk worms that spun their cocoons so that it could be unwound in one long strand. The reeling, or unwinding of silk worm cocoons is started by placing the cocoons in boiling water in order to break apart the silk filaments as well as kill the silk worm pupae. Women would then find the end of the strands of silk by sticking their hand into the boiling water. Usually this task was done by girls aged eight to twelve, while the more complex jobs were given to older women. They would then create a silk thread, which could vary in thickness and strength from the unwound cocoons.

After the reeling of the silk, the silk would be dyed before the weaving process began. There were many different looms and tools for weaving. For high quality and intricate designs, a wooden draw-loom or pattern loom was used. This loom would require two or three weavers and was usually operated by men. There were also other smaller looms, such as the waist loom, that could be operated by a single woman and were usually used domestically.

Sericulture and silk weaving spread to Korea by 200 BCE, to Khotan by 50 CE, and to Japan by about 300 CE.

The pit-treadle loom may have originated in India though most authorities establish the invention in China. Pedals were added to operate heddles. By the Middle Ages such devices also appeared in Persia, Sudan, Egypt and possibly the Arabian Peninsula, where &quot;the operator sat with his feet in a pit below a fairly low-slung loom&quot;. In 700 CE, horizontal looms and vertical looms could be found in many parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. In Africa, the rich dressed in cotton while the poorer wore wool.
By the 12th century it had come to Europe either from the Byzantium or Moorish Spain where the mechanism was raised higher above the ground on a more substantial frame.
===Southeast Asia===
In the Philippines, numerous pre-colonial weaving traditions exist among different ethnic groups. They used various plant fibers, mainly abacá or banana, but also including tree cotton, buri palm (locally known as ) and other palms, various grasses (like and ), and barkcloth. The oldest evidence of weaving traditions are Neolithic stone tools used for preparing barkcloth found in archeological sites in Sagung Cave of southern Palawan and Arku Cave of Peñablanca, Cagayan. The latter has been dated to around 1255–605 BCE.

Other countries in Southeast Asia have their own extensive history of weaving traditions. Weaving was introduced to Southeast Asia at the same time rice agriculture was introduced from China. As it was introduced alongside rice farming, weaving is more popular in communities where rice is being farmed as compared to communities that rely on hunting, gathering, and animal farming.

Each country has its own distinctive weaving traditions or has absorbed weaving traditions from their neighboring countries. The most common material used for weaving is cotton that is interwoven with threads made of different materials. Brunei is famous for its Jong Sarat, a cloth usually used in traditional weddings, uses silver and gold threads interwoven usually with cotton threads. Similarly, Indonesia has the Songket, also used in traditional weddings, which also utilizes gold and silver wrapped thread to create elaborate designs on their weaved textiles. On the other hand, Cambodia has the Ikat, which utilizes the method of dyeing thunks of thread tied with fiber to create patterns while weaving. In addition to using threads, weavers of Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam combine silk and other fibers with cotton for weaving. While in Laos, natural materials are used, like roots, tree bark, leaves, flowers, and seeds, but for dyeing the textile that has been already weaved. These countries in Southeast Asia have more weaving traditions but these techniques are the popular ones.

To create threads of cotton for weaving, spindle whorls were commonly used in Southeast Asia. It is made from either clay, stone or wood and has a variety of appearances regarding its shape and size. Spindle whorls were said to emerge in Southeast Asia along with expansion of rice agriculture from Yangtse, China. Additionally, its increasing appearance in certain regions of Southeast Asia back then may be also a sign of the enlargement of cotton thread and textile production. Due to its low cost and portability because of its small size, it was favored among rural weaving communities in countries of Southeast Asia.

Weaved textiles in Southeast Asia are mostly made with looms. The foot brace loom is the earliest loom introduced to Southeast Asia from China, having its first appearance in Vietnam. Although, it was only used in certain areas of Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, and Cambodia. Another loom that is widely used across Southeast Asia is the ground level body tension loom, also known as the belt loom, as a part of it needs to be attached to a belt-like strap on the weaver’s waist to control and hold the tension of the warped threads. It is usually operated at the ground level and the weaver is able to control the threads by leaning backwards and forward. The body tension loom was developed from the foot-brace loom to eventually accommodate weaving of larger and wider cloth types.

===Medieval Europe===

The predominant fibre in Europe during the medieval period was wool, followed by linen and nettlecloth for the lower classes. Cotton was introduced to Sicily and Spain in the 9th century. When Sicily was captured by the Normans, they took the technology to Northern Italy and then the rest of Europe. Silk fabric production was reintroduced towards the end of this period and the more sophisticated silk weaving techniques were applied to the other staples.

The weaver worked at home and marketed his cloth at fairs. Warp-weighted looms were commonplace in Europe before the introduction of horizontal looms in the 10th and 11th centuries. Weaving became an urban craft and to regulate their trade, craftsmen applied to establish a guild. These initially were merchant guilds, but developed into separate trade guilds for each skill. The cloth merchant who was a member of a city&#x27;s weavers guild was allowed to sell cloth; he acted as a middleman between the tradesmen weavers and the purchaser. The trade guilds controlled quality and the training needed before an artisan could call himself a weaver.

By the 13th century, an organisational change took place, and a system of putting out was introduced. The cloth merchant purchased the wool and provided it to the weaver, who sold his produce back to the merchant. The merchant controlled the rates of pay and economically dominated the cloth industry. The merchants&#x27; prosperity is reflected in the wool towns of eastern England; Norwich, Bury St Edmunds and Lavenham being good examples. Wool was a political issue. The supply of thread has always limited the output of a weaver. About that time, the spindle method of spinning was replaced by the great wheel and soon after the treadle-driven spinning wheel. The loom remained the same but with the increased volume of thread it could be operated continuously.

The 14th century saw considerable flux in population. The 13th century had been a period of relative peace; Europe became overpopulated. Poor weather led to a series of poor harvests and starvation. There was great loss of life in the Hundred Years War. Then in 1346, Europe was struck with the Black Death and the population was reduced by up to a half. Arable land was labour-intensive and sufficient workers no longer could be found. Land prices dropped, and land was sold and put to sheep pasture. Traders from Florence and Bruges bought the wool, then sheep-owning landlords started to weave wool outside the jurisdiction of the city and trade guilds. The weavers started by working in their own homes then production was moved into purpose-built buildings. The working hours and the amount of work were regulated. The putting-out system had been replaced by a factory system. 
The migration of the Huguenot Weavers, Calvinists fleeing from religious persecution in mainland Europe, to Britain around the time of 1685 challenged the English weavers of cotton, woollen and worsted cloth, who subsequently learned the Huguenots&#x27; superior techniques.

===Colonial United States===
Colonial America relied heavily on Great Britain for manufactured goods of all kinds. British policy was to encourage the production of raw materials in colonies and discourage manufacturing. The Wool Act 1699 restricted the export of colonial wool.
As a result, many people wove cloth from locally produced fibres. The colonists also used wool, cotton and flax (linen) for weaving, though hemp could be made into serviceable canvas and heavy cloth. They could get one cotton crop each year; until the invention of the cotton gin it was a labour-intensive process to separate the seeds from the fibres. Functional tape, bands, straps, and fringe were woven on box and paddle looms. 

A plain weave was preferred as the added skill and time required to make more complex weaves kept them from common use. Sometimes designs were woven into the fabric but most were added after weaving using wood block prints or embroidery. 

===Industrial Revolution===
Before the Industrial Revolution, weaving was a manual craft and wool was the principal staple. In the great wool districts a form of factory system had been introduced but in the uplands weavers worked from home on a putting-out system. The wooden looms of that time might be broad or narrow; broad looms were those too wide for the weaver to pass the shuttle through the shed, so that the weaver needed an expensive assistant (often an apprentice). This ceased to be necessary after John Kay invented the flying shuttle in 1733. The shuttle and the picking stick sped up the process of weaving. There was thus a shortage of thread or a surplus of weaving capacity. The opening of the Bridgewater Canal in June 1761 allowed cotton to be brought into Manchester, an area rich in fast flowing streams that could be used to power machinery. Spinning was the first to be mechanised (spinning jenny, spinning mule), and this led to limitless thread for the weaver.

Edmund Cartwright first proposed building a weaving machine that would function similar to recently developed cotton-spinning mills in 1784, drawing scorn from critics who said the weaving process was too nuanced to automate. He built a factory at Doncaster and obtained a series of patents between 1785 and 1792. In 1788, his brother Major John Cartwight built Revolution Mill at Retford (named for the centenary of the Glorious Revolution). In 1791, he licensed his loom to the Grimshaw brothers of Manchester, but their Knott Mill burnt down the following year (possibly a case of arson). Edmund Cartwight was granted a reward of £10,000 by Parliament for his efforts in 1809. However, success in power-weaving also required improvements by others, including H. Horrocks of Stockport. Only during the two decades after about 1805, did power-weaving take hold. At that time there were 250,000 hand weavers in the UK. Textile manufacture was one of the leading sectors in the British Industrial Revolution, but weaving was a comparatively late sector to be mechanised. The loom became semi-automatic in 1842 with Kenworthy and Bulloughs Lancashire Loom. The various innovations took weaving from a home-based artisan activity (labour-intensive and man-powered) to steam driven factories process. A large metal manufacturing industry grew to produce the looms, firms such as Howard &amp; Bullough of Accrington, and Tweedales and Smalley and Platt Brothers. Most power weaving took place in weaving sheds, in small towns circling Greater Manchester away from the cotton spinning area. The earlier combination mills where spinning and weaving took place in adjacent buildings became rarer. Wool and worsted weaving took place in West Yorkshire and particular Bradford, here there were large factories such as Lister&#x27;s or Drummond&#x27;s, where all the processes took place. Both men and women with weaving skills emigrated, and took the knowledge to their new homes in New England, to places like Pawtucket and Lowell.

Woven &#x27;grey cloth&#x27; was then sent to the finishers where it was bleached, dyed and printed. Natural dyes were originally used, with synthetic dyes coming in the second half of the 19th century. A demand for new dyes followed the discovery of mauveine in 1856, and its popularity in fashion. Researchers continued to explore the chemical potential of coal tar waste from the growing number of gas works in Britain and Europe, creating an entirely new sector in the chemical industry.

The invention in France of the Jacquard loom, patented in 1804, enabled complicated patterned cloths to be woven, by using punched cards to determine which threads of coloured yarn should appear on the upper side of the cloth. The jacquard allowed individual control of each warp thread, row by row without repeating, so very complex patterns were suddenly feasible. Samples exist showing calligraphy, and woven copies of engravings. Jacquards could be attached to handlooms or powerlooms.

A distinction can be made between the role and lifestyle and status of a handloom weaver, and that of the power loom weaver and craft weaver. The perceived threat of the power loom led to disquiet and industrial unrest. Well known protests movements such as the Luddites and the Chartists had handloom weavers amongst their leaders. In the early 19th-century power weaving became viable. Richard Guest in 1823 made a comparison of the productivity of power and handloom weavers:

A very good Hand Weaver, a man twenty-five or thirty years of age, will weave two pieces of nine-eighths shirting per week, each twenty-four yards long, and containing one hundred and five shoots of weft in an inch, the reed of the cloth being a forty-four, Bolton count, and the warp and weft forty hanks to the pound, A Steam Loom Weaver, fifteen years of age, will in the same time weave seven similar pieces.

He then speculates about the wider economics of using power loom weavers:

...it may very safely be said, that the work is done in a Steam Factory containing two hundred Looms, would, if done by hand Weavers, find employment and support for a population of more than two thousand persons.With the Industrial Revolution came a growth in opportunity for women to work within textile factories. However, in spite of their gender, their work was perceived to have a lower social and economic value than work done by their male counterparts.

===Modern day===

In the 1920s the weaving workshop of the Bauhaus design school in Germany aimed to raise weaving, previously seen as a craft, to a fine art, and also to investigate the industrial requirements of modern weaving and fabrics. Under the direction of Gunta Stölzl, the workshop experimented with unorthodox materials, including cellophane, fibreglass, and metal. From expressionist tapestries to the development of soundproofing and light-reflective fabric, the workshop&#x27;s innovative approach instigated a modernist theory of weaving. Former Bauhaus student and teacher Anni Albers published the seminal 20th-century text &quot;On Weaving&quot; in 1965. Other notables from the Bauhaus weaving workshop include Otti Berger, Margaretha Reichardt, and Benita Koch-Otte.

In the Bauhaus, the weaving workshop was considered &quot;the women&#x27;s department&quot;, and many women were forced to join against wishes to study another art form. Some weavers, like Helene Nonné-Schmidt believed that women were made to weave because they could only produce work in 2-D. She thought women lacked the spatial imagination and genius men had to work in other mediums.

Hand weaving of Persian carpets and kilims has been an important element of the tribal crafts of many of the subregions of modern day Iran. Examples of carpet types are the Lavar Kerman carpet from Kerman and the Seraband rug from Arāk.

In Southeast Asia, some communities are working to revive weaving traditions as a way to address poverty, improve living conditions, support local communities, and to promote environmental sustainability. Several initiatives have been established to support this effort, such as the Maybank Women Eco-Weavers program by the Maybank Foundation which currently operates in Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia. This program helps create opportunities for women weavers throughout the Southeast Asia region to improve their livelihoods and to give them financial independence.

Additionally, similar programs exist in Taiwan and in the Philippines. In Taiwan, The Lihang Studio and S’uraw Education was founded by Yuma Taru to revive the Atayal weaving culture and to promote indigenous education in weaving and dyeing. In the Philippines, the Kyyangan Weavers Association was established in the Ifugao Province as a way to conserve and promote the Ifugao weaving culture and other traditional practices. Also, this association collaborates with academic institutions, government agencies and other non-government organizations on research and product development to be able to offer economic opportunities for communities.

==Types Of Weaving==
===Hand loom weavers===
Handloom weaving was done by both genders but men outnumbered women partially due to the strength needed to batten. They worked from home sometimes in a well-lit attic room. The women of the house would spin the thread they needed, and attend to finishing. Later women took to weaving, they obtained their thread from the spinning mill, and working as outworkers on a piecework contract. Over time competition from the power looms drove down the piece rate and they existed in increasing poverty.

===Power loom weavers===

Power loom workers were usually girls and young women. They had the security of fixed hours, and except in times of hardship, such as in the cotton famine, regular income. They were paid a wage and a piece work bonus. Even when working in a combined mill, weavers stuck together and enjoyed a tight-knit community. The women usually minded the four machines and kept the looms oiled and clean. They were assisted by &#x27;little tenters&#x27;, children on a fixed wage who ran errands and did small tasks. They learnt the job of the weaver by watching. Often they would be half timers, carrying a green card which teacher and overlookers would sign to say they had turned up at the mill in the morning and the afternoon at the school. At fourteen or so they come full-time into the mill, and started by sharing looms with an experienced worker where it was important to learn quickly as they would both be on piece work.Serious problems with the loom were left to the tackler to sort out. He would inevitably be a man, as were usually the overlookers. The mill had its health and safety issues, there was a reason why the women tied their hair back with scarves. Inhaling cotton dust caused lung problems, and the noise was causing total hearing loss. Weavers would mee-maw as normal conversation was impossible. Weavers used to &#x27;kiss the shuttle&#x27;, that is, suck thread through the eye of the shuttle. This left a foul taste in the mouth due to the oil, which was also carcinogenic.

===Craft weavers===

Arts and Crafts was an international design philosophy that originated in England and flourished between 1860 and 1910 (especially the second half of that period), continuing its influence until the 1930s. Instigated by the artist and writer William Morris (1834–1896) during the 1860s and inspired by the writings of John Ruskin (1819–1900), it had its earliest and most complete development in the British Isles but spread to Europe and North America. It was largely a reaction against mechanisation and the philosophy advocated of traditional craftsmanship using simple forms and often medieval, romantic or folk styles of decoration. Handweaving was highly regarded and taken up as a decorative art.

==Indigenous cultures==

===Native Americans===
Textile weaving, using cotton dyed with pigments, was a dominant craft among pre-colonization tribes of the American southwest, including various Pueblo peoples, the Zuni, and the Ute tribes. The first Spaniards to visit the region wrote about seeing Navajo blankets. With the introduction of Navajo-Churro sheep, the resulting woolen products have become very well known. By the 18th century the Navajo had begun to import yarn with their favorite color, Bayeta red. Using an upright loom, the Navajo wove blankets worn as garments and then rugs after the 1880s for trade. Navajo traded for commercial wool, such as Germantown, imported from Pennsylvania. Under the influence of European-American settlers at trading posts, Navajos created new and distinct styles, including &quot;Two Gray Hills&quot; (predominantly black and white, with traditional patterns), &quot;Teec Nos Pos&quot; (colorful, with very extensive patterns), &quot;Ganado&quot; (founded by Don Lorenzo Hubbell), red dominated patterns with black and white, &quot;Crystal&quot; (founded by J. B. Moore), &quot;Oriental&quot; and Persian styles (almost always with natural dyes), &quot;Wide Ruins,&quot; &quot;Chinlee,&quot; banded geometric patterns, &quot;Klagetoh,&quot; diamond type patterns, &quot;Red Mesa&quot; and bold diamond patterns. Many of these patterns exhibit a fourfold symmetry, which is thought to embody traditional ideas about harmony, or &quot;hózhó&quot;.

===Amazon cultures===
Among the indigenous people of the Amazon basin densely woven palm-bast mosquito netting, or tents, were utilized by the Panoans, Tupinambá, Western Tucano, Yameo, Záparoans, and perhaps by the indigenous peoples of the central Huallaga River basin (Steward 1963:520). Aguaje palm-bast (Mauritia flexuosa, Mauritia minor, or swamp palm) and the frond spears of the Chambira palm (Astrocaryum chambira, A.munbaca, A.tucuma, also known as Cumare or Tucum) have been used for centuries by the Urarina of the Peruvian Amazon to make cordage, net-bags hammocks, and to weave fabric. Among the Urarina, the production of woven palm-fiber goods is imbued with varying degrees of an aesthetic attitude, which draws its authentication from referencing the Urarina&#x27;s primordial past. Urarina mythology attests to the centrality of weaving and its role in engendering Urarina society. The post-diluvial creation myth accords women&#x27;s weaving knowledge a pivotal role in Urarina social reproduction.
Even though palm-fiber cloth is regularly removed from circulation through mortuary rites, Urarina palm-fiber wealth is neither completely inalienable, nor fungible since it is a fundamental medium for the expression of labor and exchange. The circulation of palm-fiber wealth stabilizes a host of social relationships, ranging from marriage and fictive kinship (&quot;compadrazco&quot;, spiritual compeership) to perpetuating relationships with the deceased.

==Computer science==
The Nvidia Parallel Thread Execution ISA derives some terminology (specifically the term Warp to refer to a group of concurrent processing threads) from historical weaving traditions.

== Gender politics ==

=== Women&#x27;s work ===

Weaving is a practice that is typically considered to be &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot;, either part of their employment, cultural practices, or leisure. The categorization of weaving as women&#x27;s work has bled into many fields, from art history, anthropology, sociology, and even psychology. While claiming that women had not contributed much to civilization&#x27;s history, Sigmund Freud wrote that &quot;one technique which they may have invented [is] that of plaiting and weaving.&quot;

Women&#x27;s work is often not recorded as a central activity to building Western history and culture. Yet, some anthropologists argue that textile production facilitated societal establishment and growth, therefore women were integral to perpetuating communities. To record their stories, beliefs, and symbols important to their culture, women engaged in weaving, embroidering, or other fiber practices. These practices have existed for centuries documented through art history, myth, and oral history and are still practiced today.

=== Reception in the mainstream art world ===
Weaving is often classified as &quot;craft&quot; alongside other art forms like ceramics, embroidery, basket weaving, and more. Historically, there has been a hierarchy between artists who were considered &quot;craftspeople&quot; and artists who worked in traditional mediums of painting and sculpture. The traditional artists wanted to keep artisans in the minority, so there was little reception for arts that were considered craft.

In 1939, art critic Clement Greenberg wrote &quot;Avant-Garde and Kitsch&quot; where he presented his ideas about &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; art. His definition of &quot;low&quot; art was likely informed by years of theory against decoration and ornamentation, which was correlated with femininity in the early 1900s by critics like Adolf Loos and Karl Scheffler. Although Greenberg never explicitly says the word &quot;craft&quot;, many scholars postulate that this is one of the origins of Western opposition to weaving, and more largely art that is considered craft.

Only recently has the art world begun to recognize weaving as an art form and to exhibit woven articles as art objects. Exhibitions of large scope have been organized to affirm the importance of textiles in the art historical canon, such as the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles&#x27; With Pleasure: Pattern and Decoration in American Art 1972–1985. Women weavers, like Anni Albers, Lenore Tawney, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Olga de Amaral, and Sheila Hicks, are now the subject of exhibitions and major retrospectives across the world.

<text>Yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, used in sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, ropemaking, and the production of textiles. &quot;Thread&quot; is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or machine. Modern manufactured sewing threads may be finished with wax or other lubricants to withstand the stresses involved in sewing. Embroidery threads are yarns specifically designed for needlework. Yarn can be made of a number of natural or synthetic materials, and comes in a variety of colors and thicknesses (referred to as &quot;weights&quot;). Although yarn may be dyed different colours, most yarns are solid coloured with a uniform hue.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&quot; comes from Middle English, from the Old English , akin to Old High German &#x27;, &quot;yarn&quot;, Dutch &#x27;, Ancient Greek &quot;&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, and Sanskrit , &quot;band&quot;.

== History ==
The human production of yarn is known to have existed since the Stone Age and earlier prehistory, with ancient fiber materials developing from animal hides, to reeds, to early fabrics. Cotton, wool, and silk were the first materials for yarn, and textile trade contributed immensely to the ancient global economy. In 2011, the Bangladesh University of Textiles established a specialized Department of Yarn Engineering, focusing on the advanced techniques of transforming textile fibers into yarn.

== Materials ==
Yarn can be made from a number of natural or synthetic fibers, or a blend of natural and synthetic fibers.

=== Natural fibers ===
====Cotton==== 

The most common plant fiber is cotton, which is typically spun into fine yarn for mechanical weaving or knitting into cloth.

====Silk====
Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles. The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of fibroin and is produced by the larvae of the moth &quot;Bombyx mori&quot;. Silk production is thought to have begun in China and silk thread and cloth manufacture was well-established by the Shang dynasty (1600–1050 BCE).

====Linen====
Linen is another natural fiber with a long history of use for yarn and textiles. Linen fibers are derived from the flax plant. 

====Other plant fibers====

Other plant fibers which can be spun include bamboo, hemp, maize, nettle, and soy fiber.

====Animal fibers====
The most common spun animal fiber is wool harvested from sheep. As long fibers make better yarn, sheep have been bred over time to produce longer fibers. This increases the need for shearing to prevent pests and overheating.

Other animal fibers used include alpaca, angora, mohair, llama, cashmere, and silk. More rarely, yarn may be spun from camel, yak, possum, musk ox, vicuña, cat, dog, wolf, rabbit, bison, or chinchilla hair, as well as turkey or ostrich feathers.

===Synthetic fibers===

Some examples of synthetic fibers that are used as yarn are nylon, acrylic fiber, rayon, and polyester. Synthetic fibers are generally extruded in continuous strands of gel-state materials. These strands are drawn (stretched), annealed (hardened), and cured to obtain properties desirable for later processing.

Synthetic fibers come in three basic forms: staple, tow, and filament. Staple is cut fibers, generally sold in lengths up to 120 mm. Tow is a continuous &quot;rope&quot; of fibers consisting of many filaments loosely joined side-to-side. Filament is a continuous strand consisting of anything from one filament to many. Synthetic fiber is most often measured in a weight per linear measurement basis, along with cut length. Denier and Dtex are the most common weight to length measures. Cut-length only applies to staple fiber.

Filament extrusion is sometimes referred to as &quot;spinning,&quot; but most people equate spinning with spun yarn production.

===Yarn from recycled materials===
T-shirt yarn is a recycled yarn made from the same fabric as is used in T-shirts and other clothes. It is often made from the remainder fabric of clothing manufacture, and therefore is considered a recycled and eco-friendly product. It can also be made at home out of used clothing. The resulting yarn can be used in knitted or crocheted items.

=== Comparison of material properties ===

In general, natural fibers tend to require more careful handling than synthetics because they can shrink, felt, stain, shed, fade, stretch, wrinkle, or be eaten by moths more readily, unless special treatments such as mercerization or super washing are performed to strengthen, fix color, or otherwise enhance the fiber&#x27;s own properties.

Some types of protein yarns (i.e., hair, silk, feathers) may feel irritating to some people, causing contact dermatitis, hives, or wheezing. These reactions are likely a sensitivity to thicker and coarser fiber diameter or fiber ends. In fact, contrary to popular belief, wool allergies are practically unknown. According to a study reviewing the evidence of wool as an allergen conducted by Acta Dermato-Venereologica, contemporary superfine or ultrafine Merino wool with their reduced fibre diameters do not provoke itch, are well tolerated and in fact benefit eczema management. Further studies suggest that known allergens applied during textile processing are minimally present in wool garments today given current industry practices and are unlikely to lead to allergic reactions.

When natural hair-type fibers are burned, they tend to singe and have a smell of burnt hair; this is because many, like human hair, are protein-derived. Cotton and viscose (rayon) yarns burn as a wick. Synthetic yarns generally tend to melt, though some synthetics are inherently flame-retardant. Noting how an unidentified fiber strand burns and smells can assist in determining if it is natural or synthetic, and what the fiber content is.

Both synthetic and natural yarns can pill. Pilling is a function of fiber content, spinning method, twist, contiguous staple length, and fabric construction. Single ply yarns or using fibers like merino wool are known to pill more due to the fact that in the former, the single ply is not tight enough to securely retain all the fibers under abrasion, and the merino wool&#x27;s short staple length allows the ends of the fibers to pop out of the twist more easily.

Yarns combining synthetic and natural fibers inherit the properties of each parent, according to the proportional composition. Synthetics are added to lower cost, increase durability, add unusual color or visual effects, provide machine washability and stain resistance, reduce heat retention, or lighten garment weight.

== Structure ==


===Spun yarn===
Spun yarn is made by twisting staple fibres together to make a cohesive thread, or &quot;single&quot;. Twisting fibres into yarn in the process called spinning can be dated back to the Upper Paleolithic, and yarn spinning was one of the first processes to be industrialized. Spun yarns are produced by placing a series of individual fibres or filaments together to form a continuous assembly of overlapping fibres, usually bound together by twist. Spun yarns may contain a single type of fibre, or be a blend of various types. Combining synthetic fibres (which can have high strength, lustre, and fire retardant qualities) with natural fibres (which have good water absorbency and skin comforting qualities) is very common. The most widely used blends are cotton-polyester and wool-acrylic fibre blends. Blends of different natural fibres are common too, especially with more expensive fibres such as alpaca, angora and cashmere.

Yarn is selected for different textiles based on the characteristics of the yarn fibres, such as warmth (wool), light weight (cotton or rayon), durability (nylon is added to sock yarn, for example), or softness (cashmere, alpaca).

Yarn is composed of twisted strands of fiber, which are known as plies when grouped together. These strands of yarn are twisted together (plied) in the opposite direction to make a thicker yarn. Depending on the direction of this final twist, the yarn will have either &quot;s-twist&quot; (the threads appear to go &quot;up&quot; to the left) or &quot;z-twist&quot; (to the right). For a single ply yarn, the direction of the final twist is the same as its original twist. The twist direction of yarn can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric.

The mechanical integrity of yarn is derived from frictional contacts between its composing fibers. The science behind this was first studied by Galileo.

==== Carded and combed yarn ====
Combed yarns are produced by adding another step of yarn spinning, namely combing, which aligns the fibres and removes the short fibres carried over from the previous step of carding. Combed yarn results in superior-quality fabrics. In comparison to carded yarns, this particular yarn is slightly more expensive, because the weaving is a long, consuming process. Combining separates small fibres from elongated fibres, in which this procedure makes the yarn softer and smoother.

==== Hosiery yarn ====
Hosiery yarns are used in the manufacturing of knitted fabrics. Since the knitted materials are more delicate than woven materials; hence hosiery yarns are made &#x27;softer&#x27; with fewer twists per inch than their woven counterparts. Hosiery yarn comes from a separate spinning process (melt spinning), and is used with circular knitting machines to form fabric.

==== Open-end yarn ====
Open-end yarn is produced by open-end spinning without a spindle. The method of spinning is different from ring spinning. In open-end yarn, there is no roving frame stage. Sliver from the card goes into the rotor, is spun into yarn directly. Open-end yarn can be produced from short fibers. Open-end yarns are different from ring yarns. Open-end yarns are limited to coarser counts.

==== Novelty yarn ====

Novelty yarns or complex yarns are yarns with special (fancy) effects introduced during spinning or plying. One example is slub yarns, yarn with thick or thin sections alternating regularly or irregularly. In a similar manner, creating deliberate unevenness, additions or injections of neps or metallic or synthetic fibers (along with natural fibers) in spinning creates novelty yarns.

===Filament yarn===

Filament yarn consists of filament fibres (very long continuous fibres) either twisted together or only grouped together. Thicker monofilaments are typically used for industrial purposes rather than fabric production or decoration. Silk is a natural filament, and synthetic filament yarns are used to produce silk-like effects.

==== Texturized yarn====

Texturized yarns are made by a process of air texturizing filament yarns (sometimes referred to as &quot;taslanizing&quot;), which combines multiple filament yarns into a yarn with some of the characteristics of spun yarns. They are synthetic continuous filaments that are modified to impart special texture and appearance. It was originally applied to synthetic fibers to reduce transparency, slipperiness and increase warmth, absorbency and makes the yarn more opaque. It was used to manufacture a variety of textile products: knitted underwear and outer wear, shape-retaining knitted suits, overcoats. They also were used in the production of artificial fur, carpets, blankets, etc.

== Colour ==
Yarn may be used undyed, or may be coloured with natural or artificial dyes. Most yarns have a single uniform hue, but there is also a wide selection of variegated yarns:

* Heathered or tweed: yarn with flecks of different coloured fibre
* Ombré: variegated yarn with light and dark shades of a single hue
* Multicoloured: variegated yarn with two or more distinct hues (a &quot;parrot colourway&quot; might have green, yellow and red)
* Self-striping: yarn dyed with lengths of colour that will automatically create stripes in a knitted or crocheted object
* Marled: yarn made from strands of different-coloured yarn twisted together, sometimes in closely related hues
Each of these different colours and styles are achieved through a process called yarn dyeing. There are many different methods of yarn dyeing: package dyeing, skein dyeing, space dyeing, warp beam dyeing, and more.

* Package Dyeing: This is the most commonly used method. This is when yarn is already spun up in bulk and then lowered into a chamber filled with dye. When the yarn is done absorbing the dye, it is removed from the cylindrical chamber to dry. 
* Skein Dyeing: This is the process of when yarn is laid loosely in skeins or hanks. They are then laid on top of a bar and submerged into what is called a dyebath.
* Space Dyeing: This method is used to achieve the multi-colored effect. This method is achieved by taking sections of yarn and dipping them into different colours. After dipping one section into a colour, a chemical called mordant is used to permanently keep that color on the yarn so that the next color will not bleed into the prior color.
* Warp Beam Dyeing: This is a larger version of package dyeing; however, it is only used in the manufacture of woven fabrics.


== Weight ==
Yarn quantities for handcrafts are usually measured and sold by weight in ounces (oz) or grams (g). Common sizes include 25g, 50g, and 100g skeins. Some companies also primarily measure in ounces with common sizes being three-ounce, four-ounce, six-ounce, and eight-ounce skeins. Textile measurements are taken at a standard temperature and humidity because variations in heat and humidity can cause fibers to absorb different amounts of moisture from the air, thus increasing the measured weight of the yarn without adding any fiber material. The actual length of the yarn contained in a ball or skein can vary due to the inherent heaviness of the fibre and the thickness of the strand; for instance, a 50 g skein of lace weight mohair may contain several hundred metres, while a 50 g skein of bulky wool may contain only 60 metres.

Craft yarn comes in several thicknesses or weights. This is not to be confused with the measurement and weight listed above. The Craft Yarn Council of America promotes a standardized industry system for measuring yarn weight, where weights are numbered from 0 (finest) to 7 (thickest). Each weight can be described by a number and name: Size 0 yarn is called Lace, size 1 is Super Fine, size 2 is Fine, size 3 is Light, size 4 is Medium, size 5 is Bulky, size 6 is Super Bulky, and size 7 is Jumbo.

Each weight also has several commonly used but unregulated terms associated with it. However, this naming convention is more descriptive than precise; fibre artists disagree about where on the continuum each lies, and the precise relationships between the sizes. These terms include: fingering, sport, double-knit (or DK), worsted, aran (or heavy worsted), bulky, super-bulky, and roving.

Another measurement of yarn weight, often used by weavers, is wraps per inch (WPI). The yarn is wrapped snugly around a ruler and the number of wraps that fit in an inch are counted.

Labels on yarn for handicrafts often include information on gauge, which can also help determine yarn weight. Gauge, known in the UK as tension, is a measurement of how many stitches and rows are produced per inch or per cm on a specified size of knitting needle or crochet hook. The proposed standardization uses a four-by-four inch/ten-by-ten cm knitted stockinette or single crocheted square, with the resultant number of stitches across and rows high made by the suggested tools on the label to determine the gauge.

In Europe, textile engineers often use the unit tex, which is the weight in grams of a kilometre of yarn, or decitex, which is a finer measurement corresponding to the weight in grams of 10 km of yarn. Many other units have been used over time by different industries.

== Yarn skeins ==
There are many different ways in which yarn is wound, including hanks, skeins, donut balls, cakes, and cones.

=== Hank ===
A hank of yarn is a looped bundle of yarn, similar to how wire is typically sold. The yarn is usually tied in two places directly opposite each other to keep the loops together and to keep them from tangling. Hanks are a preferred method of fastening yarn for many yarn sellers and yarn-dyers due to its ability to more widely display the qualities of the fiber. It is often wound using a swift, a standing contraption that holds a yarn hank without obstruction and spins on a central axis to facilitate yarn ball winding There are two subtypes of hanks: twisted and folded. A twisted hank is a hank that has been twisted into a rope braid. A folded hank is a hank that has been folded in half and wrapped in a label for retail purposes.

=== Skein ===
Skeins are one of the most common types of yarn ball. Although skeins are technically described as yarn that has been wound into an oblong shape, the word &quot;skein&quot; is used generically to describe any ball of yarn. Many large-scale yarn retailers like Lion brand and parent companies like Yarnspirations sell their yarn in skeins. Unlike other types of yarn balls, a skein allows you to access both ends of the yarn. The yarn end in the inside of the skein is called a center pull. One major complaint of center pull bullet skeins is that the inside yarn end is not easily found, and often is pulled out of the skein in a jumble of tangled yarn called &quot;yarn barf&quot;. There are two types of skeins: a pull skein, which is more rectangular in shape, and a bullet skein, which is rounder.

<doc id="51974" wikidata="Q896" url="?curid=51974" title="Mountain Dew">
<text>Mountain Dew, stylized as Mtn Dew in some countries and coliqually known as Dew in some areas, is a soft drink brand owned by PepsiCo. The original formula was invented in 1940 by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman. A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1958. The rights to this formula were obtained by the Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia. William H. &quot;Bill&quot; Jones of the Tip Corporation further refined the formula, launching that version of Mountain Dew in 1961. In August 1964, the Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired from Tip by the Pepsi-Cola company, and the distribution expanded across the United States and Canada.

Between the 1940s and 1980s there was only one variety of Mountain Dew, which was citrus-flavored and caffeinated in most markets. Diet Mountain Dew was introduced in 1988, followed by Mountain Dew Red, which was introduced and discontinued in 1988. In 2001, a cherry-flavored variant called Code Red debuted. Expansions of the product line have continued to this day, including specialty offerings, limited time productions, region-specific and retailer-specific flavors of Mountain Dew.

Production was extended to the United Kingdom in 1996, but was phased out in 1998. A similarly named but different-tasting product, with a recipe more similar to the original American product has been sold in the U.K. under the name &quot;Mountain Dew Energy&quot; since 2010 and in Ireland since the spring of 2011, but in 2015 it was changed to &quot;Mountain Dew Citrus Blast&quot; to shift away from the energy drink marketing. As of 2017, Mountain Dew represented a 6.6% share of the carbonated soft drinks market in the U.S., and is the leading soft drink brand in several states including almost the entire Midwestern United States. Its competition includes the Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s Mello Yello and Surge, and Keurig Dr Pepper&#x27;s Sun Drop; Mountain Dew accounted for 80% of citrus soft drinks sold within the U.S. in 2010.

==Origin==
Tennessee bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman developed Mountain Dew as a mixer in the 1940s. Soft drinks were sold regionally in the 1930s, and the Hartmans had difficulty in Knoxville obtaining their preferred soda to mix with liquor, preferably whiskey, so the two developed their own. Originally a 19th-century slang term for whiskey, especially Highland Scotch whisky, the Mountain Dew name was trademarked for the soft drink in 1948.

Charles Gordon, who had partnered with William Swartz to bottle and promote Dr. Enuf, was introduced to Mountain Dew when he met the Hartman brothers on a train and they offered him a sample. Gordon and the Hartman brothers subsequently made a deal to bottle Mountain Dew by the Tri-Cities Beverage Corporation in Johnson City, Tennessee.

The Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia, bought the rights to Mountain Dew, revising the flavor and launching it in 1961. In 1964, Pepsico purchased the Tip Corporation and thus acquired the rights to Mountain Dew. In 1999, the Virginia legislature recognized Tip Corporation president Bill Jones and the town of Marion for their role in the history of Mountain Dew.

==Packaging==

&quot;Mountain Dew&quot; was originally Southern and/or Scots-Irish slang for moonshine (i.e., homemade whiskey or poitín), as referenced in the Irish folk song &quot;The Rare Old Mountain Dew&quot;, dating from 1882. Using it as the name for the soda was originally suggested by Carl E. Retzke at an Owens-Illinois Inc. meeting in Toledo, Ohio, and was first trademarked by Ally and Barney Hartman in the 1940s. Early bottles and signage carried the reference forward by showing a cartoon-stylized hillbilly. The first sketches of the original Mountain Dew bottle labels were devised in 1948 by John Brichetto, and the representation on product packaging has changed at multiple points in the history of the beverage.

===Logo===


PepsiCo (then The Pepsi-Cola Company) acquired the Mountain Dew brand in 1964, and shortly thereafter in 1969 the logo was modified as the company sought to shift its focus to a &quot;younger, outdoorsy&quot; generation. This direction continued as the logo remained the same through the 1970s, 1980s. In 1996, PepsiCo began using a strategy it was already using with its flagship cola Pepsi, changing Mountain Dew&#x27;s logo every few years. New logos were introduced in 1996, 1998, and 2005. In October 2008, the Mountain Dew logo was redesigned to &quot;Mtn Dew&quot; within the U.S. market, as a result of PepsiCo announcing that it would rebrand its core carbonated soft-drink products by early 2009. Returning flavors were given redesigned packaging and logos when re-released.

In October 2024, PepsiCo announced a major rebrand. The new branding, inspired by the logo introduced in 1996, reverts the naming to the full &quot;Mountain&quot; spelling; the key art features mountain scenery in the background.

===Sidekick bottles===
In summer 2010, a secondary type of Mountain Dew bottles began appearing on some US shelves. Designed by 4sight, a design and innovation firm, these bottles featured a sleeker design, smaller packaging labels, and a built-in grip. The bottles were dubbed &quot;sidekick bottles&quot; and were tested in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Indiana markets. By 2014, sidekick bottles had become the predominant Mountain Dew bottle design in most of the United States.

==Ingredients==

In its primary market of the United States, the ingredient composition of Mountain Dew is listed as: &quot;carbonated water, high-fructose corn syrup (in much of the U.S.), concentrated orange juice, citric acid, natural flavors, sodium benzoate, caffeine, sodium citrate, erythorbic acid, gum arabic, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and yellow 5.&quot; The ingredient makeup of Mountain Dew varies based on the country of production. For example, in Canada, the sweetener listed is &quot;glucose-fructose&quot; (another name for high-fructose corn syrup), and until 2012, it was caffeine-free by default. Formerly, the composition included brominated vegetable oil, an emulsifier banned in foods throughout Europe and in Japan. As of 2020, this ingredient has been removed.

In response to negative publicity around high-fructose corn syrup, PepsiCo in 2009 released a limited-run production of Mountain Dew Throwback, a variation consisting of sugar in place of high-fructose corn syrup. Mountain Dew Throwback subsequently was re-released for brief periods (generally 8–12 weeks at a time), including a second wave from December 2009 to February 2010 and a third wave in the summer and fall of 2010. A fourth eight-week production run began in March 2011, before becoming a permanent addition to the Mountain Dew flavor line-up, until being discontinued again during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A can of Mountain Dew contains 54 mg of caffeine (equivalent to ).

===Tartrazine===
An urban legend about Mountain Dew ingredients is that dye Yellow #5 (tartrazine) lowers sperm count. Tartrazine has never been scientifically linked to any of the alleged effects in the legends, nor has any other component of the drink.

===Alcohol===
In 2022, PepsiCo partnered with the Boston Beer Company to produce a line of alcohol-infused drinks in four flavors. Labelled &quot;Hard Mtn Dew&quot;, the drinks were initially sold in Florida, Iowa and Tennessee, before expanding to other states.

== Promotions ==

===Mountain Dew Amp===

Mountain Dew Amp is an energy drink distributed by PepsiCo under the Mountain Dew brand, originally launched in 2001. From 2007 to 2008, several additional flavors of Amp were introduced. In 2012, Amp&#x27;s labeling and ingredients changed, as did the flavor and appeal, according to fans. The Mountain Dew branding was also removed from cans during this change, though it has since been reintroduced.

===Taco Bell&#x27;s Mountain Dew Baja Blast===

In spring 2014, Mountain Dew began distributing its Baja Blast flavor in standard 12-ounce cans, 20-ounce bottles and 24-ounce cans for sale at supermarkets and retail businesses in the U.S. This was to celebrate the drink&#x27;s 20th anniversary and would be the first time the drink has been sold for a whole year. The new retail product bore the Taco Bell logo. Taco Bell&#x27;s chief marketing officer, Chris Brandt, said the exclusive drinks have helped increase the company&#x27;s beverage sales, even as soda sales have declined in the broader market. He noted that people are more likely to buy drinks when they are available exclusively at the chain. Due to the drink&#x27;s success, many other new beverages were introduced at Taco Bell, including a new Taco Bell exclusive, Mountain Dew Sangrita Blast, a non-alcoholic sangrita-flavored Mountain Dew.

===DEWmocracy 1===
Beginning in 2007, Mountain Dew began a promotion entitled &quot;DEWmocracy&quot;, which involved the public electing new flavors, colors, names, packaging graphics and advertisements for upcoming Mountain Dew products. The campaign has been the subject of recognition within the advertising industry, cited as one of the earliest and longest-running examples of a consumer product brand employing crowdsourcing to make decisions which are traditionally made internally by employees. In its initial phase, DEWmocracy participation and voting was conducted via an online game. Television advertisements at the time featured actor Forest Whitaker asking people to decide the next new flavor of Mountain Dew. Online voters selected from three choices: Supernova (a strawberry/melon flavor), Revolution (a berry flavor), and Voltage (a raspberry/citrus flavor). Each included ginseng. The event ended on 17 August 2008, with Voltage announced as the winning flavor. It was officially released on 29 December 2008. According to Beverage Digest, sales of DEWmocracy flavors totaled 25 million cases in 2008.

===DEWmocracy 2===
Mountain Dew announced a continuation of the DEWmocracy campaign – referred to as &quot;DEWmocracy 2&quot; – which launched in July 2009. A marked difference between DEWmocracy 2 and its predecessor was the wider range of online voting methods, expanding beyond the DEWmocracy website to include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the &quot;Dew Labs Community&quot; – a private, online forum for the &quot;most passionate Dew fans.&quot; In July 2009, Dew Labs sampling trucks distributed product samples of seven potential flavor variations. At the same time, 50 &quot;Dew fanatics&quot; were chosen based on their video submissions to the video website 12seconds.tv, and were shipped boxes of the seven prototype flavors. From the initial seven flavors, taste testers were asked to elect three final flavors for later release at retail stores. The three new candidate flavors were Distortion (a Key lime flavor), Typhoon (a tropical punch flavor), and White Out (a smooth citrus flavor). The three new candidate flavors were released on 19 April 2010 and voting lasted until 14 June. The following day, White Out was announced as the winner. Mountain Dew White Out was released for sale on 4 October 2010. A limited production White Out Slurpee (Mtn Dew White Out Freeze) was made available at 7-Eleven stores beginning in January 2011. In July 2011, Mountain Dew Typhoon was re-released briefly in 2-liter form; in June 2022, it was re-released on the Mountain Dew online store.

===Game Fuel===

In 2007, after using the term &quot;Game Fuel&quot; to market their sodas to the video-gaming subculture, Mountain Dew introduced a new flavor variant (citrus cherry) with the Game Fuel name. Coinciding with the release of the Xbox 360 game &quot;Halo 3&quot;, Mountain Dew Game Fuel sported a label that was almost entirely image-based, showing promotional artwork for the game and featuring the game series&#x27; main character Master Chief prominently. This variant remained on shelves for 12 weeks, and was discontinued afterwards.

Two years later, the website for the popular MMORPG &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; stated that two Mountain Dew Game Fuel flavors would be sold in June 2009 and would promote the game. Shortly afterwards, the bottle art was released, and showed that the two flavors would promote different player races in the game. One of the two was exactly the same citrus cherry flavor from the original &quot;Halo 3&quot; promotion, with updated packaging. The second flavor was a new wild fruit drink, similar to the previously released Pepsi Blue. Both drinks were given &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;-based packaging, and sported the newly updated &quot;MTN Dew&quot; logo. Like their precursor, these two flavors lasted for 12 weeks and were discontinued.

On 24 August 2011, Mountain Dew announced another return of the Game Fuel promotion on their Facebook page. The original citrus cherry would once again return, along with a new tropical companion flavor. The announcement gave a planned release date of October 2011 and stated that the packaging would feature codes granting players double experience points in &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot;. Both flavors were mailed out to Dew Labs members in early September 2011, a month before the planned release date. Later that same month, it was announced through the Facebook page that Game Fuel would be arriving to the public in mid-October, though it would vary by market. These flavors began appearing from the first week of October and were also discontinued after 12 weeks of being on shelves.

Game Fuel returned in October 2012 to promote &quot;Halo 4&quot;, in the original citrus-cherry flavor. In August 2013, Mountain Dew announced that Game Fuel would be returning to stores in the fall of 2013, with a new blueberry-flavored version titled &quot;Electrifying Berry&quot;. In October 2013, boxes of original citrus cherry Game Fuel appeared on store shelves with packaging promoting the Xbox One and the games &quot;Dead Rising 3&quot; and &quot;Forza Motorsport 5&quot; and with cans featuring &quot;Dead Rising 3&quot; graphics. The new Electrifying Berry flavor of Game Fuel simultaneously appeared with packaging promoting &quot;Kinect Sports Rivals&quot; and the game &quot;&quot;, graphics from which appear on the cans as well.
In May 2014, the original citrus cherry Game Fuel began reappearing on shelves, but this time, the soda does not seem to be promoting any video game.

In October 2014, Game Fuel returned with a new lemonade flavor for the promotion of &quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot;. Unlike past two-variant Game Fuel releases, both drinks sport the same artwork (unlike 2009&#x27;s Horde Red and Alliance Blue or 2011&#x27;s citrus cherry and tropical), albeit differing colors to match their respective flavors. After the promotion ended, Citrus Cherry reverted to packaging not promoting a game, while lemonade flavor was permanently removed from shelves.

In October 2015, Game Fuel returned with a new companion flavor, Berry Lime, for the promotion of &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops III&quot;. After the promotion, Citrus Cherry once again reverted to promotion-less packaging, while the Berry Lime flavor remained available as a Slurpee.

Images leaked in May 2016 led to speculation that Game Fuel would once again see a new release later in 2016, with a new mango-flavored variant alongside the original citrus cherry flavor, promoting the game &quot;Titanfall 2&quot;. Mountain Dew announced the return of Game Fuel and the new flavor, Mango Heat, in September. Then, in October, Game Fuel was released with the &quot;Titanfall 2&quot; promotion, with a lower calorie version of the original citrus cherry variant returning alongside the new Mango Heat.

In 2017, Game Fuel returned with two previously discontinued flavors: Arctic Burst (originally released as a Slurpee flavor in 2006 to promote &quot;Superman Returns&quot;) and Tropical Smash (originally Flavor #736, one of the four prototype flavors for &quot;DEWmocracy II&quot; that lost to Mountain Dew White Out and did not even make the final round). As was the case with the 2013 promotion, the two flavors promoted two different Xbox games (Arctic Burst promoted &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot; while Tropical Smash promoted &quot;Forza 7&quot;). For the first time, Citrus Cherry was not fully part of the promotion; instead, promotion-less Citrus Cherry was sold with the same white caps with codes under them as the other flavors in the promotion.

In January 2019, PepsiCo introduced a new line of Game Fuel drinks called Amp Game Fuel, since renamed to simply &quot;Game Fuel&quot;. The can features a re-sealable lid. Game Fuel has 90 mg of caffeine and also includes theanine and vitamins A and B. The Citrus Cherry flavor from the original Game Fuel lineup was re-released under this new product line in April 2022.

In 2023, Game Fuel returned with two flavors: Citrus Cherry and Mystic Punch. As was the case with the 2017 promotion, the two flavors promoted two different Xbox games (Citrus Cherry promoted Halo Infinite while Mystic Punch promoted Diablo IV).

===Green Label===

Green Label is an online magazine, a partnership between Mountain Dew and Complex Media producing sponsored content covering action sports, music, art and style, housed at Green-Label.com. The site replaces several websites and a YouTube channel that have been overseen by PepsiCo since 2007. The initiative originated in 2013 and will continue through the year.

====Green Label Art====
Mountain Dew&#x27;s Green Label promotion originated in 2007, when a line of limited edition aluminum bottles was put into production, featuring artwork from a range of tattoo artists and other artists. This initial series marked the first use of the term &quot;Green Label Art&quot; to describe the use of artistic works on Mountain Dew packaging. In June 2010, a contest entitled &quot;Green Label Art: Shop Series&quot; was announced, involving 35 independent skateboard store owners who partnered with local artists to design and submit future can artwork designs. Approximately one million votes were submitted by the conclusion of the contest in October of the same year, with Street Science Skate Shop – a store in Tracy, California – named the winner of a cash prize. This winning can design was scheduled to appear on Mountain Dew cans at some point in 2011.

====Green Label Sound====
In 2008, a Mountain Dew-sponsored music label was launched under the name &quot;Green Label Sound&quot;. In December 2010, a Mountain Dew Code Red television advertisement was produced, incorporating the hip-hop artist Jay Electronica performing his song &quot;The Announcement&quot;. The advertisement concludes with the tagline &quot;Hip Hop is different on the mountain&quot;.

The label released its first full-length album release, &quot;When Fish Ride Bicycles&quot; by the hip hop group The Cool Kids, on 12 June 2011.

====Dew Tour/Green Label experience====
Sponsorship of action sports athletes has been a part of Mountain Dew marketing since the late 1990s, with present sponsorship including Eli Reed (skateboarder), Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder), and Danny Davis (snowboarder). Mountain Dew also sponsors its own namesake festival, &quot;The Dew Tour&quot;, which is an action sports tour made up of events held in five U.S. cities over several months. The first Dew Tour was held in the summer of 2005 with events in skateboarding, BMX and Freestyle Motocross. In 2008 it expanded to add a &quot;Winter Dew Tour&quot;, comprising snowboarding and snow skiing competitions. It is &quot;the most watched and attended action sports event in the world,&quot; according to &quot;Transworld Snowboarding&quot; magazine. In coordination with its Dew Tour sponsorship, a sponsored television show entitled &quot;Mountain Dew&#x27;s Green Label Experience&quot; premiered on Fuel TV in July 2010, for the primary purpose of broadcasting interviews with action sports athletes from each of the stops on the Dew Tour.

====Green Label Gaming====
Under the term &quot;Green Label Gaming&quot; – coined in 2007 – Mountain Dew has broadened its sponsorship of independent video game designers and players. The brand was often the subject of media attention for its popularity among video game enthusiasts, as several flavors of Mountain Dew have been produced in partnership with video games. In December 2008, Mountain Dew produced a 30-minute television special which documented independent gamers in Japan and the U.S., which aired on the Spike TV network. In 2009, Mountain Dew sponsored two prominent gaming events: the Independent Games Festival and the Game Developers Conference. &quot;Green Label Gaming&quot; has since come under controversy over a sponsored Game Jam-themed reality show by Matti Leshem.

===Doritos Quest===
In 2008, Doritos debuted a mystery flavor known as &quot;Quest&quot;, featuring a campaign of online puzzles and prizes to identify the Quest flavor. The flavor was later identified as Mountain Dew.

===FanDEWmonium===
In October 2010, Mountain Dew started the &quot;FanDEWmonium&quot; promotion, a competition in which new flavors would compete to become permanent similar to the two DEWmocracy campaigns, but with eight diet flavors instead of three regular ones. Five of the participating flavors were diet versions of previous DEWmocracy flavors: Diet SuperNova, Diet Voltage, Diet Crave, Diet Distortion, Diet Typhoon, and Diet White Out. Another flavor, Diet Ultra Violet, returned from its own limited release in 2009. The remaining competitor was a brand-new Diet flavor created specifically for the promotion - Flare (berry/citrus-flavored). Each of the eight flavors was available for tasting at specific tour locations, and special cans were also mailed to some Dew Labs members.

Also similar to the DEWmocracy campaign, those who taste-tested the Diet flavors were asked to go online and vote for which flavors they thought should be permanently sold in stores. After the first round of voting was completed, two flavor finalists were chosen to receive a limited release to store shelves for a final round of voting. Diet Voltage and Diet SuperNova were sold in stores for an eight-week period beginning in March 2011. After votes were cast, it was announced that Diet SuperNova had won, with 55% of all votes, and it returned in January 2012. Afterwards, it was removed from shelves permanently after a 12-week release due to low sales.

===Back by Popular DEWmand===
On 7 January 2011, Mountain Dew posted on their Facebook that Pitch Black would return to the shelves in May 2011, also stating that this may be the start of many re-releases of old favorites. The company promoted Pitch Black&#x27;s return heavily with giveaways and contests. About a month before the planned release date, a photo was posted on a Mountain Dew worker&#x27;s Pongr, which showed Pitch Black and 2008&#x27;s Supernova. Two weeks before the release, Dew Labs announced the return of 2010&#x27;s Typhoon in 2-liter bottles exclusively at Walmart Supercenters. The three flavors were re-released to stores on 2 May.

At the same time of the DEWmand Promotion, Mountain Dew launched the Throwback Shack, a website where participators could enter to win exclusive Dew merchandise, including a &quot;secret stash&quot; of Mountain Dew Revolution, a losing competitor from 2008&#x27;s DEWmocracy. The promotional advertisements were then taken down from the Mountain Dew website. Mountain Dew later stated via tweet that there would not be any more flavors returning &#x27;by Popular DEWmand&#x27; for now, as it was only intended to be a summer program.

===Dub the Dew===
In August 2012, Villa Enterprises held a promotion known as &quot;Dub the Dew&quot;, where users were asked to submit and vote on name ideas for a green apple flavor of Mountain Dew. The promotion was infamously hijacked by users, particularly those originating from the imageboard and 4chan, who submitted and upvoted entries such as &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot;, &quot;Diabeetus&quot;, &quot;Fapple&quot;, &quot;Bill Cosby Sweat&quot;, &quot;Jimmie Rustle&#x27;s Jumpin&#x27; Juice&quot;, and numerous variations of &quot;Gushing Granny&quot;. Although the promotion was not directly connected to Mountain Dew, a representative from the company did offer to &quot;help clean up&quot; the site. &quot;Adweek&quot; compared the incident to another recent campaign hijacked under similar circumstances, where musician Pitbull was sent to perform in Kodiak, Alaska, in a Walmart promotion.

===Puppy Monkey Baby===
On 7 February 2016, for Super Bowl 50, Mountain Dew aired a spot featuring a CGI character dubbed &quot;the puppy monkey baby&quot; (also styled PuppyMonkeyBaby). The promotion has garnered a wide amount of media coverage, both positive and negative. According to iSpot.tv, the spot was rated #1 of all the Super Bowl commercials of the night, having generated 2.2 million online views and 300,000 social media interactions after airing.

The ad features a computer-generated mash-up of three things that the public generally finds to be cute or harmless; a Pug puppy (the head), a monkey (the body and tail), and a dancing baby (the hips and legs). The puppy monkey baby dances with three men who are presumably watching the Super Bowl, offering them Mountain Dew Kickstart, which is similarly described as being a combination of three things (Mountain Dew, juice, and caffeine).

The media response to the advertisement was mixed to negative. Melissa Cronin of Gawker described it as a &quot;horror-hallucination of brand awareness&quot;, while noting the beverage itself contains brominated vegetable oil, a chemical that is banned in several countries. Jim Joseph, chief integrated marketing officer at Cohn &amp; Wolfe, called it &quot;weird&quot;.

===DEWcision 2016===
On 16 April 2016, Mountain Dew announced the return of two popular favorites, Baja Blast and Pitch Black. Fans could vote on which flavor stays permanently on store shelves via the Mountain Dew website. Voting ended on 9 July, and, after many delays, Pitch Black was announced the winner on 18 July 2016. Pitch Black became part of the brand&#x27;s flavor lineup starting in September, and was produced for several years before being discontinued by early 2020.

=== Mountain Dew Spark and Spark Zero ===
Mountain Dew Spark is a raspberry lemonade flavored beverage and a part of the Mountain Dew line up of offerings.

==In popular culture==
The computer worm Code Red was named because the person who discovered the worm was drinking this version of Mountain Dew at the time.

In the musical &quot;Be More Chill&quot;, green Mountain Dew activates the &quot;squip&quot;, a tiny super-computer in a pill that tells the user what to do, in order to help them achieve their goals. Mountain Dew Red shuts them off. In the musical, it is said that this is the reason for Mountain Dew Red being discontinued.

Bakar’s song &quot;Hell N Back&quot; includes the lyric “ She liked petty crimes, she had green eyes like Mountain Dew.” Sabrina Carpenter&#x27;s 2024 hit song &quot;Espresso&quot; included the lyric &quot;I know I Mountain Dew it for ya&quot;.

===Canada===
It is a misconception that virtually all cities and towns in Western Canada, which were created after the federal &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; of 1870, (the majority of all such cities), were planned. Most of these were, indeed, railway towns, founded after surveying and planning by the powerful railway companies during construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Canada&#x27;s first transcontinental line, or the Canadian National Railway, but this initial start generally only provided one or two streets with a few lots set out, from which the cities grew unplanned.

*Manila — Planned according to the Laws of the Indies during the Spanish Colonial Period. Towns and parishes surrounding Spanish Manila (Intramuros) grew following the contour of the Pasig River or organically. By the late 19th century, this town and parishes were absorbed to create the modern-day city of Manila planned by American architect Daniel Burnham. However, his plan was never fully realized because of the outbreak of World War II. There are six circumferential roads and ten radial roads in Metro Manila with the City of Manila as its axis (focal center).

<doc id="51983" wikidata="Q3114" url="?curid=51983" title="Canberra">
<text>Canberra ( ; ) is the capital city of Australia. Founded following the federation of the colonies of Australia as the seat of government for the new nation, it is Australia&#x27;s largest inland city, the most densely populated capital city, and the eighth-largest Australian city overall. The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory at the northern tip of the Australian Alps, the country&#x27;s highest mountain range. Canberra&#x27;s estimated population was 466,566.

The area chosen for the capital had been inhabited by Aboriginal Australians for up to 21,000 years, by groups including the Ngunnawal and Ngambri. European settlement commenced in the first half of the 19th century, as evidenced by surviving landmarks such as St John&#x27;s Anglican Church and Blundells Cottage. On 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved. Following a long dispute over whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital, a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in New South Wales, so long as it was at least from Sydney. The capital city was founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913. A plan by the American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected after an international design contest, and construction commenced in 1913. Unusual among Australian cities, it is an entirely planned city. The Griffins&#x27; plan featured geometric motifs and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks such as Black Mountain, Mount Ainslie, Capital Hill and City Hill. Canberra&#x27;s mountainous location makes it the only mainland Australian city where snow-capped mountains can be seen in winter, although snow in the city itself is uncommon.

As the seat of the Government of Australia, Canberra is home to many important institutions of the federal government, national monuments and museums. These include Parliament House, Government House, the High Court building and the headquarters of numerous government agencies. It is the location of many social and cultural institutions of national significance such as the Australian War Memorial, the Australian National University, the Royal Australian Mint, the Australian Institute of Sport, the National Gallery, the National Museum and the National Library. The city is home to many important institutions of the Australian Defence Force including the Royal Military College Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy. It hosts all foreign embassies in Australia as well as regional headquarters of many international organisations, not-for-profit groups, lobbying groups and professional associations.

Canberra has been ranked among the world&#x27;s best cities to live in and visit. Although the Commonwealth Government remains the largest single employer in Canberra, it is no longer the majority employer. Other major industries have developed in the city, including in health care, professional services, education and training, retail, accommodation and food, and construction. Compared to the national averages, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher; tertiary education levels are higher, while the population is younger. At the 2016 Census, 32% of Canberra&#x27;s inhabitants were reported as having been born overseas.

Canberra&#x27;s design is influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. Its design can be viewed from its highest point at the Telstra Tower and the summit of Mount Ainslie. Other notable features include the National Arboretum, born out of the 2003 Canberra bushfires, and Lake Burley Griffin, named for Walter Burley Griffin. Highlights in the annual calendar of cultural events include Floriade, the largest flower festival in the Southern Hemisphere, the Enlighten Festival, Skyfire, the National Multicultural Festival and Summernats. Canberra&#x27;s main sporting venues are Canberra Stadium and Manuka Oval. The city is served with domestic and international flights at Canberra Airport, while interstate train and coach services depart from Canberra railway station and the Jolimont Centre respectively. City Interchange and Alinga Street station form the main hub of Canberra&#x27;s bus and light rail transport network.

==Name==
The word &quot;Canberra&quot; is derived from the Ngunnawal language of a local Ngunnawal or Ngambri clan who resided in the area and were referred to by the early British colonists as either the , or tribe. Joshua John Moore, the first European land-owner in the region, named his grant &quot;Canberry&quot; in 1823 after these people. &quot;Canberry Creek&quot; and &quot;Canberry&quot; first appeared on regional maps from 1830, while the derivative name &quot;Canberra&quot; started to appear from around 1857.

Numerous local commentators, including the Ngunnawal elder Don Bell, have speculated upon possible meanings of &quot;Canberra&quot; over the years. These include &quot;meeting place&quot;, &quot;woman&#x27;s breasts&quot; and &quot;the hollow between a woman&#x27;s breasts&quot;.

Alternative proposals for the name of the city during its planning included Austral, Australville, Aurora, Captain Cook, Caucus City, Cookaburra, Dampier, Eden, Eucalypta, Flinders, Gonebroke, Home, Hopetoun, Kangaremu, Myola, Meladneyperbane, New Era, Olympus, Paradise, Shakespeare, Sydmelperadbrisho, Swindleville, The National City, Union City, Unison, Wattleton, Wheatwoolgold, Yass-Canberra.

==History==

=== First Nations peoples ===
The first peoples of the Canberra area include the Ngunnawal, Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples. Other groups claiming a connection to the land include the Ngarigo (who also lived directly to the south) and the Ngambri-Guumaal. Neighbouring groups include the Wandandian to the east, the Walgulu also to the south, Gandangara people to the north and Wiradjuri to the north-west.

The first British settlers into the Canberra area described two clans of Ngunnawal people resident to the vicinity. The &quot;Canberry&quot; or &quot;Nganbra&quot; clan lived mostly around Sullivan&#x27;s Creek and had ceremonial grounds at the base of Galambary (Black Mountain), while the &quot;Pialligo&quot; clan had land around what is now Canberra Airport. The people living here carefully managed and cultivated the land with fire and farmed yams and hunted for food.

Archaeological evidence of settlement in the region includes inhabited rock shelters, rock paintings and engravings, burial places, camps and quarry sites as well as stone tools and arrangements. Artefacts suggests early human activity occurred at some point in the area 21,000 years previously.

Still today, Ngunnawal men into the present conduct ceremony on the banks of the river, Murrumbidgee River. They travel upstream as they receive their Totems and corresponding responsibilities for land management. &#x27;Murrum&#x27; means &#x27;Pathway&#x27; and Bidgee means &#x27;Boss&#x27;.

The submerged limestone caves beneath Lake Burley Griffin contained Aboriginal rock art, some of the only sites in the region.

Galambary (Black Mountain) is an important Aboriginal meeting and business site, predominantly for men&#x27;s business. According to the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, Mt Ainslie is primarily for place of women&#x27;s business. Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie are referred to as women&#x27;s breasts. Galambary was also used by Ngunnawal people as an initiation site, with the mountain itself said to represent the growth of a boy into a man.

=== British exploration and colonisation ===

 In October 1820, Charles Throsby led the first British expedition to the area. Four other expeditions occurred between 1820 and 1823 with the first accurate map being produced by explorer Mark John Currie in June 1823. By this stage, the area had become known as the Limestone Plains.

British settlement of the area probably dates from late 1823, when a sheep station was formed on what is now the Acton Peninsula by James Cowan, the head stockman employed by Joshua John Moore. Moore had received a land grant in the region in 1823 and formally applied to purchase the site on 16 December 1826. He named the property &quot;Canberry&quot;. On 30 April 1827, Moore was told by letter that he could retain possession of at Canberry.

Other colonists soon followed Moore&#x27;s example to take up land in the region. Around 1825, James Ainslie, working on behalf of the wealthy merchant Robert Campbell, arrived to establish a sheep station. He was guided to the region by a local Aboriginal girl who showed him the fine lands of her &quot;Pialligo&quot; clan. The area then became the property of Campbell and it was initially named Pialligo before Campbell changed it to the Scottish title of Duntroon. Campbell and his family built a dairy on the site in 1832, now regarded as the oldest standing European building in Canberra, followed by the imposing stone house that is now the officers&#x27; mess of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The Campbells sponsored settlement by other farmer families to work their land, such as the Southwells of &quot;Weetangera&quot;.

Other notable early colonists included Henry Donnison, who established the Yarralumla estate—now the site of the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia—in 1827, and John Palmer who employed Duncan Macfarlane to form the Jerrabomberra property in 1828. A year later, John MacPherson established the Springbank estate, becoming the first British owner-occupier in the region.

The Anglican church of St John the Baptist, in the suburb of Reid, was consecrated in 1845, and is now the oldest surviving public building in the city. St John&#x27;s churchyard contains the earliest graves in the district. It has been described as a &quot;sanctuary in the city&quot;, remaining a small English village-style church even as the capital grew around it. Canberra&#x27;s first school, St John&#x27;s School (now a museum), was situated next to the church and opened in the same year of 1845. It was built to educate local settlers children, including the Blundell children who lived in nearby Blundell&#x27;s Cottage.

As the European presence increased, the Indigenous population dwindled largely due to the destruction of their society, dislocation from their lands and from introduced diseases such as influenza, smallpox, alcoholism, and measles.

===Creation of the nation&#x27;s capital===

The district&#x27;s change from a rural area in New South Wales to the national capital started during debates over federation in the late 19th century. Following a long dispute over whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital, a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in New South Wales, so long as it was at least from Sydney, with Melbourne to be the temporary seat of government while the new capital was built. A survey was conducted across several sites in New South Wales with Bombala, southern Monaro, Orange, Yass, Albury, Tamworth, Armidale, Tumut, and Dalgety all discussed. Dalgety was chosen by the federal parliament and it passed the &quot;Seat of Government Act 1904&quot; confirming Dalgety as the site of the nation&#x27;s capital. However, the New South Wales government refused to cede the required territory as they did not accept the site. In 1906, the New South Wales Government finally agreed to cede sufficient land provided that it was in the Yass-Canberra region as this site was closer to Sydney. Newspaper proprietor John Gale circulated a pamphlet titled &#x27;Dalgety or Canberra: Which?&#x27; advocating Canberra to every member of the Commonwealth&#x27;s seven state and federal parliaments. By many accounts, it was decisive in the selection of Canberra as the site in 1908 as was a result of survey work done by the government surveyor Charles Scrivener. The NSW government ceded the district to the federal government in 1911 and the Federal Capital Territory was established.

An international design competition was launched by the Department of Home Affairs on 30 April 1911, closing on 31 January 1912. The competition was boycotted by the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Institution of Civil Engineers and their affiliated bodies throughout the British Empire because the Minister for Home Affairs King O&#x27;Malley insisted that the final decision was for him to make rather than an expert in city planning. A total of 137 valid entries were received. O&#x27;Malley appointed a three-member board to advise him but they could not reach unanimity. On 24 May 1911, O&#x27;Malley came down on the side of the majority of the board with the design by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin of Chicago, Illinois, United States, being declared the winner. Second was Eliel Saarinen of Finland and third was Alfred Agache of Brazil but resident in Paris, France. O&#x27;Malley then appointed a six-member board to advise him on the implementation of the winning design. On 25 November 1912, the board advised that it could not support the Griffins&#x27; plan in its entirety and suggested an alternative plan of its own devising. This plan ostensibly incorporated the best features of the three place-getting designs as well as of a fourth design by H. Caswell, R.C.G. Coulter and W. Scott-Griffiths of Sydney, the rights to which it had purchased. It was this composite plan that was endorsed by Parliament and given formal approval by O&#x27;Malley on 10 January 1913. However, it was the Griffin plan which was ultimately proceeded with. In 1913, Walter Burley Griffin was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction and construction began. On 23 February, King O&#x27;Malley drove the first peg in the construction of the future capital city.

In 1912, the government invited suggestions from the public as to the name of the future city. Almost 750 names were suggested. At midday on 12 March 1913, Lady Denman, the wife of Governor-General Lord Denman, announced that the city would be named &quot;Canberra&quot; at a ceremony at Kurrajong Hill, which has since become Capital Hill and the site of the present Parliament House. Canberra Day is a public holiday observed in the ACT on the second Monday in March to celebrate the founding of Canberra. After the ceremony, bureaucratic disputes hindered Griffin&#x27;s work; a Royal Commission in 1916 ruled his authority had been usurped by certain officials and his original plan was reinstated. Griffin&#x27;s relationship with the Australian authorities was strained and a lack of funding meant that by the time he was fired in 1920, little work had been done. By this time, Griffin had revised his plan, overseen the earthworks of major avenues and established the Glenloch Cork Plantation.

=== Development throughout 20th century ===
The Commonwealth government purchased the pastoral property of Yarralumla in 1913 to provide an official residence for the Governor-General of Australia in the new capital. Renovations began in 1925 to enlarge and modernise the property. In 1927, the property was officially dubbed Government House. On 9 May that year, the Commonwealth parliament moved to Canberra with the opening of the Provisional Parliament House. The Prime Minister Stanley Bruce had officially taken up residence in The Lodge a few days earlier. Planned development of the city slowed significantly during the depression of the 1930s and during World War II. Some projects planned for that time, including Roman Catholic and Anglican cathedrals, were never completed. (Nevertheless, in 1973 the Roman Catholic parish church of St. Christopher was remodelled into St. Christopher&#x27;s Cathedral, Manuka, serving the Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn. It is the only cathedral in Canberra.)

From 1920 to 1957, three bodies — successively the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, the Federal Capital Commission, and the National Capital Planning and Development Committee — continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra in the absence of Griffin. However, they were only advisory and development decisions were made without consulting them, which increased inefficiency.

The largest event in Canberra up to World War II was the 24th Meeting of ANZAAS in January 1939. &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; described it as &quot;a signal event ... in the history of this, the world&#x27;s youngest capital city&quot;. The city&#x27;s accommodation was not nearly sufficient to house the 1,250 delegates and a tent city had to be set up on the banks of the Molonglo River. One of the prominent speakers was H. G. Wells, who was a guest of the Governor-General Lord Gowrie for a week. This event coincided with a heatwave across south-eastern Australia during which the temperature in Canberra reached 108.5 degrees Fahrenheit (42.5 Celsius) on 11 January. On Friday, 13 January, the Black Friday bushfires caused 71 deaths in Victoria and Wells accompanied the Governor-General on his tour of areas threatened by fires.

Immediately after the end of the war, Canberra was criticised for resembling a village and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly. Canberra was often derisively described as &quot;several suburbs in search of a city&quot;. Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment. Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city for poor performance. Menzies remained in office for over a decade and in that time the development of the capital sped up rapidly. The population grew by more than 50 per cent in every five-year period from 1955 to 1975. Several Government departments, together with public servants, were moved to Canberra from Melbourne following the war. Government housing projects were undertaken to accommodate the city&#x27;s growing population.

The National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) formed in 1957 with executive powers and ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of Lake Burley Griffin — the centrepiece of Griffin&#x27;s design — and construction was completed in 1964 after four years of work. The completion of the lake finally laid the platform for the development of Griffin&#x27;s Parliamentary Triangle. Since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance have been constructed on its shores.

The newly built Australian National University was expanded and sculptures as well as monuments were built. A new National Library was constructed within the Parliamentary Triangle, followed by the High Court and the National Gallery. Suburbs in Canberra Central (often referred to as North Canberra and South Canberra) were further developed in the 1950s and urban development in the districts of Woden Valley and Belconnen commenced in the mid and late 1960s respectively, followed by the district of Tuggeranong in the mid-1970s. Many of the new suburbs were named after Australian politicians such as Barton, Deakin, Reid, Braddon, Curtin, Chifley and Parkes.

On 9 May 1988, a larger and permanent Parliament House was opened on Capital Hill as part of Australia&#x27;s bicentenary celebrations. The Commonwealth Parliament moved there from the Provisional Parliament House, now known as Old Parliament House.

=== Self-government ===
In December 1988, the Australian Capital Territory was granted full self-government by the Commonwealth Parliament, a step proposed as early as 1965. Following the first election on 4 March 1989, a 17-member Legislative Assembly sat at temporary offices at 1 Constitution Avenue, Civic, on 11 May 1989. Permanent premises were opened on London Circuit in 1994. The Australian Labor Party formed the ACT&#x27;s first government, led by the Chief Minister Rosemary Follett, who made history as Australia&#x27;s first female head of government. The 1990s also saw urban development begin in the district of Gungahlin in the far north of the ACT.

Parts of Canberra were engulfed by bushfires on 18 January 2003 that killed four people, injured 435 and destroyed more than 500 homes as well as the major research telescopes of Australian National University&#x27;s Mount Stromlo Observatory.

Throughout 2013, several events celebrated the 100th anniversary of the naming of Canberra. On 11 March 2014, the last day of the centennial year, the Canberra Centenary Column was unveiled in City Hill. Other works included &quot;The Skywhale&quot;, a hot air balloon designed by the sculptor Patricia Piccinini, and &quot;StellrScope&quot; by visual media artist Eleanor Gates-Stuart. On 7 February 2021, &quot;The Skywhale&quot; was joined by &quot;Skywhalepapa&quot; to create a &quot;Skywhale family&quot;, an event marked by Skywhale-themed pastries and beer produced by local companies as well as an art pop song entitled &quot;We are the Skywhales&quot;.

In 2014, Canberra was named the best city to live in the world by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and was named the third best city to visit in the world by Lonely Planet in 2017.

==Geography==
Canberra covers an area of and is located near the Brindabella Ranges (part of the Australian Alps), approximately inland from Australia&#x27;s east coast. It has an elevation of approximately AHD; the highest point is Mount Majura at . Other low mountains include Mount Taylor , Mount Ainslie , Mount Mugga Mugga and Black Mountain .

The native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly eucalypt species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.
The urban environs of the city of Canberra straddle the Ginninderra plain, Molonglo plain, the Limestone plain, and the Tuggeranong plain (Isabella&#x27;s Plain). The Molonglo River which flows across the Molonglo plain has been dammed to form the national capital&#x27;s iconic feature Lake Burley Griffin. The Molonglo then flows into the Murrumbidgee north-west of Canberra, which in turn flows north-west toward the New South Wales town of Yass. The Queanbeyan River joins the Molonglo River at Oaks Estate just within the ACT.

A number of creeks, including Jerrabomberra and Yarralumla Creeks, flow into the Molonglo and Murrumbidgee. Two of these creeks, the Ginninderra and Tuggeranong, have similarly been dammed to form Lakes Ginninderra and Tuggeranong. Until recently the Molonglo River had a history of sometimes calamitous floods; the area was a flood plain prior to the filling of Lake Burley Griffin.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen-Geiger classification, Canberra has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). In January, the warmest month, the average high is approximately ; in July, the coldest month, the average high drops to approximately .

Frost is common in the winter months. Snow is rare in the CBD (central business district) due to being on the leeward (eastern) side of the dividing range, but the surrounding areas get annual snowfall through winter and often the snow-capped Brindabella Range can be seen from the CBD. The last significant snowfall in the city centre was in 1968. Canberra is often affected by foehn winds, especially in winter and spring, evident by its anomalously warm maxima relative to altitude.

The highest recorded maximum temperature was on 4 January 2020. Winter 2011 was Canberra&#x27;s warmest winter on record, approximately above the average temperature. 

The lowest recorded minimum temperature was on the morning of 11 July 1971. Light snow falls only once in every few years, and is usually not widespread and quickly dissipates.

Canberra is protected from the west by the Brindabellas which create a strong rain shadow in Canberra&#x27;s valleys. Canberra gets 100.4 clear days annually. Annual rainfall is the third lowest of the capital cities (after Adelaide and Hobart) and is spread fairly evenly over the seasons, with late spring bringing the highest rainfall. Thunderstorms occur mostly between October and April, owing to the effect of summer and the mountains. The area is generally sheltered from a westerly wind, though strong northwesterlies can develop. A cool, vigorous afternoon easterly change, colloquially referred to as a &#x27;sea-breeze&#x27; or the &#x27;Braidwood Butcher&#x27;, is common during the summer months and often exceeds 40 km/h in the city. Canberra is also less humid than the nearby coastal areas.

Canberra was severely affected by smoke haze during the 2019/2020 bushfires. On 1 January 2020, Canberra had the worst air quality of any major city in the world, with an AQI of 7700 (USAQI 949).
===Urban structure===

Canberra is a planned city and the inner-city area was originally designed by Walter Burley Griffin, a major 20th-century American architect. Within the central area of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. Griffin&#x27;s proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii. However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.

Lake Burley Griffin was deliberately designed so that the orientation of the components was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra. The lakes stretch from east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretches from Capital Hill—the eventual location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial. This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak, the highest mountain in the ACT, approximately south west of Canberra.

The straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin of Lake Burley Griffin was perpendicular to the land axis and designated the water axis, and it extended northwest towards Black Mountain. A line parallel to the water axis, on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis. The municipal axis became the location of Constitution Avenue, which links City Hill in Civic Centre and both Market Centre and the Defence precinct on Russell Hill. Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the Parliamentary Triangle, and formed the centrepiece of Griffin&#x27;s work.
The Griffins assigned spiritual values to Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary colour which represented its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition, as World War I slowed construction and planning disputes led to Griffin&#x27;s dismissal by Prime Minister Billy Hughes after the war ended.

The urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven residential districts, each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities. The districts were settled in the following chronological order:
*Canberra Central, mostly settled in the 1920s and 1930s, with expansion up to the 1960s, 25 suburbs
*Woden Valley, first settled in 1964, 12 suburbs
*Belconnen, first settled in 1966, 27 suburbs (2 not yet developed)
*Weston Creek, settled in 1969, 8 suburbs
*Tuggeranong, settled in 1974, 18 suburbs
*Gungahlin, settled in the early 1990s, 18 suburbs (3 not yet developed)
*Molonglo Valley, development began in 2010, 13 suburbs planned.

The Canberra Central district is substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s designs. In 1967 the then National Capital Development Commission adopted the &quot;Y Plan&quot; which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the &#x27;town centres&#x27; linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y, with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.

Development in Canberra has been closely regulated by government, both through planning processes and the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. Land in the ACT is held on 99-year crown leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government. There have been persistent calls for constraints on development to be liberalised, but also voices in support of planning consistent with the original &#x27;bush capital&#x27; and &#x27;urban forest&#x27; ideals that underpin Canberra&#x27;s design.

Many of Canberra&#x27;s suburbs are named after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title. Street names typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of Duffy are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of Dunlop are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of Page are named after biologists and naturalists. Most diplomatic missions are located in the suburbs of Yarralumla, Deakin, and O&#x27;Malley. There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of Fyshwick, Mitchell, and Hume.

===Sustainability and the environment===

The average Canberran was responsible for 13.7 tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2005. In 2012, the ACT Government legislated greenhouse gas targets to reduce its emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020, 80 per cent by 2050, with no net emissions by 2060. The government announced in 2013 a target for 90% of electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources by 2020, and in 2016 set an ambitious target of 100% by 2020.

In 1996, Canberra became the first city in the world to set a vision of no waste, proposing an ambitious target of 2010 for completion. The strategy aimed to achieve a waste-free society by 2010, through the combined efforts of industry, government and community. By early 2010, it was apparent that though it had reduced waste going to landfill, the ACT initiative&#x27;s original 2010 target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised to meet the reality.

Plastic bags made of polyethylene polymer with a thickness of less than 35 μm were banned from retail distribution in the ACT from November 2011. The ban was introduced by the ACT Government in an effort to make Canberra more sustainable.

Of all waste produced in the ACT, 75 per cent is recycled. Average household food waste in the ACT remains above the Australian average, costing an average $641 per household per annum.

Canberra&#x27;s annual Floriade festival features a large display of flowers every Spring in Commonwealth Park. The organisers of the event have a strong environmental standpoint, promoting and using green energy, &quot;green catering&quot;, sustainable paper, the conservation and saving of water. The event is also smoke-free.

==Government and politics==
=== Territory government ===
There is no local council or city government for the city of Canberra. The Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly performs the roles of both a city council for the city and a territory government for the rest of the Australian Capital Territory. However, the vast majority of the population of the Territory reside in Canberra and the city is therefore the primary focus of the ACT Government.

The assembly consists of 25 members elected from five districts using proportional representation. The five districts are Brindabella, Ginninderra, Kurrajong, Murrumbidgee and Yerrabi, which each elect five members. The Chief Minister is elected by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers alongside him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet.

Whereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor, the Liberals have been able to gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly and were in government during a period of years from 1995 and 2001. Labor took back control of the Assembly in 2001. At the 2004 election, Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and the Labor Party won 9 of the 17 seats allowing them to form the ACT&#x27;s first majority government. Since 2008, the ACT has been governed by a coalition of Labor and the Greens. , the Chief Minister was Andrew Barr from the Australian Labor Party.

The Australian federal government retains some influence over the ACT government. In the administrative sphere, most frequently this is through the actions of the National Capital Authority which is responsible for planning and development in areas of Canberra which are considered to be of national importance or which are central to Griffin&#x27;s plan for the city, such as the Parliamentary Triangle, Lake Burley Griffin, major approach and processional roads, areas where the Commonwealth retains ownership of the land or undeveloped hills and ridge-lines (which form part of the Canberra Nature Park). The national government also retains a level of control over the Territory Assembly through the provisions of the &quot;Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988&quot;. This federal act defines the legislative power of the ACT assembly.

=== Federal representation ===
The ACT was given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949 when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the Division of Australian Capital Territory. However, until 1966, the ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory and did not count for purposes of forming government. In 1974, the ACT was allocated two Senate seats and the House of Representatives seat was divided into two. A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution. At the 2019 election, the third seat has been reintroduced as the Division of Bean.

The House of Representatives seats have mostly been held by Labor and usually by comfortable margins. The Labor Party has polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberal Party at every federal election since 1990 and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points. The ALP and the Liberal Party held one Senate seat each until the 2022 election when Independent candidate David Pocock unseated the Liberal candidate Zed Seselja.

=== Judiciary and policing ===

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) provides all of the constabulary services in the territory in a manner similar to state police forces, under a contractual agreement with the ACT Government. The AFP does so through its community policing arm ACT Policing.

People who have been charged with offences are tried either in the ACT Magistrates Court or, for more severe offences, the ACT Supreme Court. Prior to its closure in 2009, prisoners were held in remand at the Belconnen Remand Centre in the ACT but usually imprisoned in New South Wales. The Alexander Maconochie Centre was officially opened on 11 September 2008 by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope. The total cost for construction was $130 million. The ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal deal with minor civil law actions and other various legal matters.

Canberra has the lowest rate of crime of any capital city in Australia . , the most common crimes in the ACT were property related crimes, unlawful entry with intent and motor vehicle theft. They affected 2,304 and 966 people (580 and 243 per 100,000 persons respectively). Homicide and related offences—murder, attempted murder and manslaughter, but excluding driving causing death and conspiracy to murder—affect 1.0 per 100,000 persons, which is below the national average of 1.9 per 100,000. Rates of sexual assault (64.4 per 100,000 persons) are also below the national average (98.5 per 100,000). However the 2017 crime statistics showed a rise in some types of personal crime, notably burglaries, thefts and assaults.

==Economy==

In February 2020, the unemployment rate in Canberra was 2.9% which was lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.1%. As a result of low unemployment and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment, Canberra has the highest average level of disposable income of any Australian capital city. The gross average weekly wage in Canberra is $1827 compared with the national average of $1658 (November 2019).

The median house price in Canberra as of February 2020 was $745,000, lower than only Sydney among capital cities of more than 100,000 people, having surpassed Melbourne and Perth since 2005. The median weekly rent paid by Canberra residents is higher than rents in all other states and territories. As of January 2014 the median unit rent in Canberra was $410 per week and median housing rent was $460, making the city the third most expensive in the country. Factors contributing to this higher weekly rental market include; higher average weekly incomes, restricted land supply, and inflationary clauses in the ACT Residential Tenancies Act.

The city&#x27;s main industry is public administration and safety, which accounted for 27.1% of Gross Territory Product in 2018-19 and employed 32.49% of Canberra&#x27;s workforce. The headquarters of many Australian Public Service agencies are located in Canberra, and Canberra is also host to several Australian Defence Force establishments, most notably the Australian Defence Force headquarters and , which is a naval communications centre that is being converted into a tri-service, multi-user depot. Other major sectors by employment include Health Care (10.54%), Professional Services (9.77%), Education and Training (9.64%), Retail (7.27%), Accommodation &amp; Food (6.39%) and Construction (5.80%).

The former RAAF Fairbairn, adjacent to the Canberra Airport was sold to the operators of the airport, but the base continues to be used for RAAF VIP flights. A growing number of software vendors have based themselves in Canberra, to capitalise on the concentration of government customers; these include Tower Software and RuleBurst. A consortium of private and government investors is making plans for a billion-dollar data hub, with the aim of making Canberra a leading centre of such activity in the Asia-Pacific region. A Canberra Cyber Security Innovation Node was established in 2019 to grow the ACT&#x27;s cyber security sector and related space, defence and education industries.

==Demographics==
At the , the population of Canberra was 453,558, up from 395,790 at the 2016 census, and 355,596 at the . Canberra has been the fastest-growing city in Australia in recent years, having grown 23.3% from 2011 to 2021.

Canberrans are relatively young, highly mobile and well educated. The median age is 35 years and only 12.7% of the population is aged over 65 years. Between 1996 and 2001, 61.9% of the population either moved to or from Canberra, which was the second highest mobility rate of any Australian capital city. As at May 2017, 43% of ACT residents (25–64) had a level of educational attainment equal to at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree, significantly higher that the national average of 31%.

According to statistics collected by the National Australia Bank and reported in &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;, Canberrans on average give significantly more money to charity than Australians in other states and territories, for both dollar giving and as a proportion of income.

===Ancestry and immigration===

At the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: 
The 2016 census showed that 32% of Canberra&#x27;s inhabitants were born overseas. Of inhabitants born outside Australia, the most prevalent countries of birth were England, China, India, New Zealand and the Philippines.

1.6% of the population, or 6,476 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.

===Language===
At the 2016 census, 72.7% of people spoke only English at home. The other languages most commonly spoken at home were Mandarin (3.1%), Vietnamese (1.1%), Cantonese (1%), Hindi (0.9%) and Spanish (0.8%).

=== Religion ===
On census night in 2016, approximately 50.0% of ACT residents described themselves as Christian (excluding not stated responses), the most common denominations being Catholic and Anglican; 36.2% described themselves as having no religion.

== Culture ==

===Education===
The two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by &quot;The Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark&#x27;s Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University. The ACT Government announced on 5 March 2020 that the CIT campus and an adjoining carpark in Reid would be leased to the University of New South Wales (UNSW) for a peppercorn lease, for it to develop as a campus for a new UNSW Canberra. UNSW released a master plan in 2021 for a 6,000 student campus to be realised over 15 years at a cost of $1 billion.

The Australian Defence College has two campuses: the Australian Command and Staff College (ACSC) plus the Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies (CDSS) at Weston, and the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) beside the Royal Military College, Duntroon located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training.

Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT), with campuses in Bruce, Reid, Gungahlin, Tuggeranong and Fyshwick. The combined enrolment of the CIT campuses was over 28,000 students in 2019. Following the transfer of land in Reid for the new UNSW Canberra, a new CIT Woden is scheduled to be completed by 2025.

In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its &quot;Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools&quot; policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools was to proceed over a decade. The closure of schools provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs were planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these were usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities were easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6 per cent of ACT enrollments.

===Arts and entertainment===
Canberra is home to many national monuments and institutions such as the Australian War Memorial, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Library, the National Archives, the Australian Academy of Science, the National Film &amp; Sound Archive and the National Museum. Many Commonwealth government buildings in Canberra are open to the public, including Parliament House, the High Court and the Royal Australian Mint.

Lake Burley Griffin is the site of the Captain James Cook Memorial and the National Carillon. Other sites of interest include the Australian–American Memorial, Commonwealth Park, Commonwealth Place, the Telstra Tower, the Australian National Botanic Gardens, the National Zoo and Aquarium, the National Dinosaur Museum, and Questacon – the National Science and Technology Centre.

The Canberra Museum and Gallery in the city is a repository of local history and art, housing a permanent collection and visiting exhibitions. Several historic homes are open to the public: Lanyon and Tuggeranong Homesteads in the Tuggeranong Valley, Mugga-Mugga in Symonston, and Blundells&#x27; Cottage in Parkes all display the lifestyle of the early European settlers. Calthorpes&#x27; House in Red Hill is a well-preserved example of a 1920s house from Canberra&#x27;s very early days. Strathnairn Homestead is an historic building which also dates from the 1920s.

Canberra has many venues for live music and theatre: the Canberra Theatre and Playhouse which hosts many major concerts and productions; and Llewellyn Hall (within the ANU School of Music), a world-class concert hall are two of the most notable. The Street Theatre is a venue with less mainstream offerings. The Albert Hall was the city&#x27;s first performing arts venue, opened in 1928. It was the original performance venue for theatre groups such as the Canberra Repertory Society.

Stonefest was a large annual festival, for some years one of the biggest festivals in Canberra. It was downsized and rebranded as Stone Day in 2012. There are numerous bars and nightclubs which also offer live entertainment, particularly concentrated in the areas of Dickson, Kingston and the city. Most town centres have facilities for a community theatre and a cinema, and they all have a library. Popular cultural events include the National Folk Festival, the Royal Canberra Show, the Summernats car festival, Enlighten festival, the National Multicultural Festival in February and the &quot;Celebrate Canberra&quot; festival held over 10 days in March in conjunction with Canberra Day.

Canberra maintains sister-city relationships with both Nara, Japan and Beijing, China. Canberra has friendship-city relationships with both Dili, East Timor and Hangzhou, China. City-to-city relationships encourage communities and special interest groups both locally and abroad to engage in a wide range of exchange activities. The Canberra Nara Candle Festival held annually in spring, is a community celebration of the Canberra Nara Sister City relationship. The festival is held in Canberra Nara Park on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin.

The history of Canberra was told in the 1938 radio feature &quot;Canberra the Great&quot;.

===Media===
As Australia&#x27;s capital, Canberra is the most important centre for much of Australia&#x27;s political reportage and thus all the major media, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the commercial television networks, and the metropolitan newspapers maintain local bureaus. News organisations are represented in the &quot;press gallery&quot;, a group of journalists who report on the national parliament. The National Press Club of Australia in Barton has regular television broadcasts of its lunches at which a prominent guest, typically a politician or other public figure, delivers a speech followed by a question-and-answer session.

Canberra has a daily newspaper, &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;, which was established in 1926. There are also several free weekly publications, including news magazines &quot;CityNews&quot; and &quot;Canberra Weekly&quot; as well as entertainment guide &quot;BMA Magazine&quot;. &quot;BMA Magazine&quot; first went to print in 1992; the inaugural edition featured coverage of the Nirvana Nevermind tour.

There are a number of AM and FM stations broadcasting in Canberra (AM/FM Listing). The main commercial operators are the Capital Radio Network (2CA and 2CC), and Austereo/ARN (104.7 and Mix 106.3). There are also several community operated stations.
A DAB+ digital radio trial is also in operation, it simulcasts some of the AM/FM stations, and also provides several digital only stations (DAB+ Trial Listing).

Five free-to-air television stations service Canberra:
*ABC Canberra (ABC)
*SBS New South Wales (SBS)
*Network 10 Southern NSW &amp; ACT (CTC) – Network 10 owned and operated station
*Seven Network Southern NSW &amp; ACT (CBN) – Seven Network owned and operated station 
*WIN Television Southern NSW &amp; ACT (WIN) – Nine Network affiliate

Each station broadcasts a primary channel and several multichannels. Of the three main commercial networks:
*WIN airs a half-hour local &quot;WIN News&quot; each weeknight at 6pm, produced from a newsroom in the city and broadcast from studios in Wollongong.
*Southern Cross 10 airs short local news updates throughout the day, produced and broadcast from its Hobart studios. It previously aired a regional edition of &quot;Nine News&quot; from Sydney each weeknight at 6pm, featuring opt-outs for Canberra and the ACT when it was a Nine affiliate.
*Seven airs short local news and weather updates throughout the day, produced and broadcast from its Canberra studios.

Prior to 1989, Canberra was serviced by just the ABC, SBS and Capital Television (CTC), which later became Ten Capital in 1994 then Southern Cross Ten in 2002 then Channel 9/Southern Cross Nine in 2016 and finally Channel 10 in 2021, with Prime Television (now Prime7) and WIN Television arriving as part of the Government&#x27;s regional aggregation program in that year.

Pay television services are available from Foxtel (via satellite) and telecommunications company TransACT (via cable).

===Sport===

In addition to local sporting leagues, Canberra has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and international competitions. The best known teams are the Canberra Raiders and the ACT Brumbies who play rugby league and rugby union respectively; both have been champions of their leagues. Both teams play their home games at Canberra Stadium, which is the city&#x27;s largest stadium and was used to hold group matches in football for the 2000 Summer Olympics and in rugby union for the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

Canberra United represents the city in the A-League Women (formerly the W-League), the national women&#x27;s soccer league and were champions in the 2011–12 season. A men&#x27;s team is set to join the A-League Men in the 2024–25 season.

The city also has a successful basketball team, the Canberra Capitals, which has won seven out of the last eleven national women&#x27;s basketball titles. The Canberra Vikings represent the city in the National Rugby Championship and finished second in the 2015 season.

There are also teams that participate in national competitions in netball, field hockey, ice hockey, cricket and baseball.

The historic Prime Minister&#x27;s XI cricket match is played at Manuka Oval annually. Other significant annual sporting events include the Canberra Marathon and the City of Canberra Half Ironman Triathlon.

Canberra has been bidding for an Australian Football League club since 1981 when Australian rules in the Australian Capital Territory was more popular. While the league has knocked back numerous proposals, according to the AFL Canberra belongs to the Greater Western Sydney Giants who play three home games at Manuka Oval each season.

Other significant annual sporting events include the Canberra Marathon and the City of Canberra Half Ironman Triathlon.

The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) is located in the Canberra suburb of Bruce. The AIS is a specialised educational and training institution providing coaching for elite junior and senior athletes in a number of sports. The AIS has been operating since 1981 and has achieved significant success in producing elite athletes, both local and international. The majority of Australia&#x27;s team members and medallists at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney were AIS graduates.

Canberra has numerous sporting ovals, golf courses, skate parks, and swimming pools that are open to the public. Tennis courts include those at the National Sports Club, Lyneham, former home of the Canberra Women&#x27;s Tennis Classic. A Canberra-wide series of bicycle paths are available to cyclists for recreational and sporting purposes. Canberra Nature Parks have a large range of walking paths, horse and mountain bike trails. Water sports like sailing, rowing, dragon boating and water skiing are held on Canberra&#x27;s lakes. The Rally of Canberra is an annual motor sport event, and from 2000 to 2002, Canberra hosted the Canberra 400 event for V8 Supercars on the temporary Canberra Street Circuit, which was located inside the Parliamentary Triangle.

A popular form of exercise for people working near or in the Parliamentary Triangle is to do the &quot;bridge to bridge walk/run&quot; of about 5 km around Lake Burley Griffin, crossing the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge and Kings Avenue Bridge, using the paths beside the lake. The walk takes about 1 hour, making it ideal for a lunchtime excursion. This is also popular on weekends. Such was the popularity during the COVID-19 isolation in 2020 that the ACT Government initiated a &#x27;Clockwise is COVID-wise&#x27; rule for walkers and runners.

==Infrastructure==

===Health===
Canberra has two large public hospitals, the approximately 600-bed Canberra Hospital—formerly the Woden Valley Hospital—in Garran and the 174-bed Calvary Public Hospital in Bruce. Both are teaching institutions. The largest private hospital is the Calvary John James Hospital in Deakin. Calvary Private Hospital in Bruce and Healthscope&#x27;s National Capital Private Hospital in Garran are also major healthcare providers.

The Royal Canberra Hospital was located on Acton Peninsula on Lake Burley Griffin; it was closed in 1991 and was demolished in 1997 in a controversial and fatal implosion to facilitate construction of the National Museum of Australia. The city has 10 aged care facilities. Canberra&#x27;s hospitals receive emergency cases from throughout southern New South Wales, and ACT Ambulance Service is one of four operational agencies of the ACT Emergency Services Authority. NETS provides a dedicated ambulance service for inter-hospital transport of sick newborns within the ACT and into surrounding New South Wales.

===Transport===

The automobile is by far the dominant form of transport in Canberra. The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density; this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.

Canberra&#x27;s districts are generally connected by parkways—limited access dual carriageway roads with speed limits generally set at a maximum of . An example is the Tuggeranong Parkway which links Canberra&#x27;s CBD and Tuggeranong, and bypasses Weston Creek. In most districts, discrete residential suburbs are bounded by main arterial roads with only a few residential linking in, to deter non-local traffic from cutting through areas of housing.

In an effort to improve road safety, traffic cameras were first introduced to Canberra by the Kate Carnell Government in 1999. The traffic cameras installed in Canberra include fixed red-light and speed cameras and point-to-point speed cameras; together they bring in revenue of approximately $11 million per year in fines.

ACTION, the government-operated bus service, provides public transport throughout the city. CDC Canberra provides bus services between Canberra and nearby areas of New South Wales of (Murrumbateman and Yass) and as Qcity Transit (Queanbeyan). A light rail line commenced service on 20 April 2019 linking the CBD with the northern district of Gungahlin. A planned Stage 2A of Canberra&#x27;s light rail network will run from Alinga Street station to Commonwealth Park, adding three new stops at City West, City South and Commonwealth Park. In February 2021 ACT Minister for Transport and City Services Chris Steel said he expects construction on Stage 2A to commence in the 2021-22 financial year, and for &quot;tracks to be laid&quot; by the next Territory election in 2024. At the 2016 census, 7.1% of the journeys to work involved public transport, while 4.5% walked to work.

There are two local taxi companies. Aerial Capital Group enjoyed monopoly status until the arrival of Cabxpress in 2007. In October 2015 the ACT Government passed legislation to regulate ride sharing, allowing ride share services including Uber to operate legally in Canberra. The ACT Government was the first jurisdiction in Australia to enact legislation to regulate the service. Since then many other ride sharing and taxi services have started in ACT namely Ola, Glide Taxi and GoCatch

An interstate NSW TrainLink railway service connects Canberra to Sydney. Canberra railway station is in the inner south suburb of Kingston. Between 1920 and 1922 the train line crossed the Molonglo River and ran as far north as the city centre, although the line was closed following major flooding and was never rebuilt, while plans for a line to Yass were abandoned. A gauge construction railway was built in 1923 between the Yarralumla brickworks and the provisional Parliament House; it was later extended to Civic, but the whole line was closed in May 1927. Train services to Melbourne are provided by way of a NSW TrainLink bus service which connects with a rail service between Sydney and Melbourne in Yass, about a one-hour drive from Canberra.

Plans to establish a high-speed rail service between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney, have not been implemented, as the various proposals have been deemed economically unviable. The original plans for Canberra included proposals for railed transport within the city, however none eventuated. The phase 2 report of the most recent proposal, the High Speed 
Rail Study, was published by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport on 11 April 2013. A railway connecting Canberra to Jervis Bay was also planned but never constructed.

Canberra is about three hours by road from Sydney on the Federal Highway (National Highway 23), which connects with the Hume Highway (National Highway 31) near Goulburn, and seven hours by road from Melbourne on the Barton Highway (National Highway 25), which joins the Hume Highway at Yass. It is a two-hour drive on the Monaro Highway (National Highway 23) to the ski fields of the Snowy Mountains and the Kosciuszko National Park. Batemans Bay, a popular holiday spot on the New South Wales coast, is also two hours away via the Kings Highway.

Canberra Airport provides direct domestic services to Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Gold Coast, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth, Sunshine Coast and Sydney with connections to other domestic centres. There are also direct flights to small regional towns: Ballina, Dubbo, Newcastle and Port Macquarie in New South Wales. Canberra Airport is, as of September 2013, designated by the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development as a restricted use designated international airport. International flights have previously been operated by both Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways. Fiji Airways has announced direct flights to Nadi commencing in July 2023. Until 2003 the civilian airport shared runways with RAAF Base Fairbairn. In June of that year, the Air Force base was decommissioned and from that time the airport was fully under civilian control.

Canberra has one of the highest rates of active travel of all Australian major cities, with 7.1 per cent of commuters walking or cycling to work in 2011. An ACT Government survey conducted in late 2010 found that Canberrans walk an average of 26 minutes each day. According to &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; in March 2014, Canberra&#x27;s cyclists are involved in an average of four reported collisions every week. The newspaper also reported that Canberra is home to 87,000 cyclists, translating to the highest cycling participation rate in Australia; and, with higher popularity, bike injury rates in 2012 were twice the national average.

Since late 2020, two scooter-sharing systems have been operational in Canberra: orange scooters from Neuron Mobility and purple scooters from Beam Mobility, both Singapore-based companies that operate in many Australian cities. These services cover much of Canberra Central and Central Belconnen, with plans to expand coverage to more areas of the city in 2022.

===Utilities===
The government-owned Icon Water manages Canberra&#x27;s water and sewerage infrastructure. ActewAGL is a joint venture between ACTEW and AGL, and is the retail provider of Canberra&#x27;s utility services including water, natural gas, electricity, and also some telecommunications services via a subsidiary TransACT.

Canberra&#x27;s water is stored in four reservoirs, the Corin, Bendora and Cotter dams on the Cotter River and the Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River. Although the Googong Dam is located in New South Wales, it is managed by the ACT government. Icon Water owns Canberra&#x27;s two wastewater treatment plants, located at Fyshwick and on the lower reaches of the Molonglo River.

Electricity for Canberra mainly comes from the national power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick (via Queanbeyan). Power was first supplied from the Kingston Powerhouse near the Molonglo River, a thermal plant built in 1913, but this was finally closed in 1957. The ACT has four solar farms, which were opened between 2014 and 2017: Royalla (rated output of 20 megawatts, 2014), Mount Majura (2.3 MW, 2016), Mugga Lane (13 MW, 2017) and Williamsdale (11 MW, 2017). In addition, numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels or solar hot water systems. In 2015 and 2016, rooftop solar systems supported by the ACT government&#x27;s feed-in tariff had a capacity of 26.3 megawatts, producing 34,910 MWh. In the same year, retailer-supported schemes had a capacity of 25.2 megawatts and exported 28,815 MWh to the grid (power consumed locally was not recorded).

There are no wind-power generators in Canberra, but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 megawatt Capital Wind Farm. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020, raising the target from 210 to 550 megawatts. It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these are expected to be operational by 2017. Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016. The ACT government announced in 2014 that up to 23 megawatts of feed-in-tariff entitlements would be made available for the establishment of a facility in the ACT or surrounding region for burning household and business waste to produce electricity by 2020.

The ACT has the highest rate with internet access at home (94 per cent of households in 2014–15).

<doc id="51984" wikidata="Q17156859" url="?curid=51984" title="Models of deafness">
<text>The three models of deafness are rooted in either social or biological sciences. These are the &quot;cultural model, the social model, and the&quot; &quot;medical&quot; (or &quot;infirmity&quot;) &quot;model&quot;. The model through which the deaf person is viewed can impact how they are treated as well as their own self perception. In the cultural model, the Deaf belong to a culture in which they are neither infirm nor disabled, but rather have their own fully grammatical and natural language. In the medical model, deafness is viewed undesirable, and it is to the advantage of the individual as well as society as a whole to &quot;cure&quot; this condition. The social model seeks to explain difficulties experienced by deaf individuals that are due to their environment.

== Cultural Model ==

Within the cultural model of deafness, Deaf people see themselves as a linguistic and cultural minority community rather than a &quot;disability group&quot;. Advocates of Deaf culture use a capital &quot;D&quot; to distinguish cultural Deafness from deafness as a pathology.

Deaf culture is distinct in that the inability to hear is not seen as a &quot;loss&quot; or something that negatively impacts an individual&#x27;s quality of life. It is an asset of and for the Deaf community to be deaf in behavior, values, knowledge and fluency in sign language. The experience of the Deaf being a language minority is comparable to other minorities&#x27; native languages being important to group identification and the preservation of their culture. Deaf clubs (such as NAD- The National Association of the Deaf) and Deaf schools have played large roles in the preservation of sign language and Deaf culture. Residential schools for deaf children serve as a vital link in the transmission of the rich culture and language, seeing as they are ideal environments for children to acquire and master sign language and pass on Deaf cultural values. Like all educational settings, these environments are key to providing deaf children valuable life lessons and skills that will help them prosper in any environment they may find themselves in.

Rather than embrace the view that deafness is a &quot;personal tragedy&quot;, the Deaf community contrasts the medical model of deafness by seeing all aspects of the deaf experience as positive. The birth of a deaf child is seen as a cause for celebration. Deaf people point to the perspective on child rearing they share with hearing people. For example, hearing parents may feel that they relate to their hearing child because of their experience and intimate understanding of the hearing state of being. It follows that a Deaf parent will have easier experiences raising a deaf child since Deaf parents have an intimate understanding of the deaf state of being. Evidence of Deaf parental success is revealed in scholastic achievement. Deaf children who have Deaf parents that communicate in sign language from birth, generally perform better in their academics than other deaf children with hearing parents. This includes children who adapted using speech and lipreading, prosthetic devices such as the cochlear implants, hearing aid technology, and artificial language systems such as Signing Exact English and Cued Speech. Deaf children acquiring sign languages from birth also reach language milestones at similar rates to their hearing counterparts, unlike deaf children born to hearing parents acquiring speech.

Members of the Deaf community define deafness as a matter of culturally determined behaviors rather than an audiological factor. Thus, those within the Deaf community tend to be, but are not limited to, deaf people, especially congenitally deaf people whose primary language is the sign language of their nation or community, as well as their hearing or deaf children (hearing children of Deaf adults are typically called CODAs: Child of Deaf adult), families, friends and other members of their social networks. This cultural model of deafness represents the natural evolution of the social networks of a minority language group. From the conceptual framework of the cultural model come implicit questions, such as: &quot;How is deafness influenced by the physical and social environment in which it is embedded? What are the interdependent values, mores, art forms, traditions, organizations, and language that characterize this culture?&quot;

== Social Model ==

The social model of deafness stems from the social model of disability. The concept of social disability was created by people who are disabled themselves, their families, friends, and associated social and political networks. Professionals in the human services fields and the social sciences greatly contributed to the social model. This model describes a person&#x27;s disability on the basis of two factors:

# the physical or mental traits that cause this disability
# their environment, as it is influenced by the perception of others.

Through this lens individuals who are deaf are considered disabled due to their inability to hear, which hearing counterparts in their surroundings have historically viewed as a disadvantage. Deaf people may also have other disabilities. People with disabilities affirm that the design of the environment often disables them. In more accessible environments where those that are deaf have access to language that is not only spoken they are disabled less, or not at all. Areas where hearing and deaf individuals interact, called contact zones, often leave deaf individuals at a disadvantage because of the environment being tailored to suit the needs of the hearing counterpart. The history of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, when looking specifically at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language, supports this notion. At one point in time, the deaf population on the island was so great that it was commonplace for hearing residents to know and use both signed and spoken language to communicate with their neighbors. In this environmental design, it was not &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;disabling&quot; if one was not able to hear in order to communicate. With certain disabilities, medical intervention can improve subsequent health issues. This is true to parts of the deaf population, as in some cases hearing can be gained with the assistance of medical technologies. The social model acknowledges the hard truth that medical intervention does not address societal issues that prevail - regardless of its extent or success.

In addition to changing environments from disabling to enabling atmospheres, advocates of the social model support the complete integration of disabled people into society. They encourage maximum integration with peers who are not disabled by their environment, especially, but not exclusively, in the school setting. Ultimately, the goal of proponents of the social model is to ensure all people are fully able to enjoy &quot;all human rights and fundamental freedoms&quot;. The social model of disability&#x27;s ideology of &quot;all-inclusive&quot; school environments is not adhered to in the cultural model. Residential schools separate deaf and hard of hearing children from their hearing counterparts. The existence of these schools demonstrate an example of respecting and embracing the totality of the deaf experience rather than dismissing it. While the social model&#x27;s promotion of inclusion at every level is a great principle, it may not always be the best environment in practice. In the case of deafness, there is a lot a child can miss in a mainstreamed schooling environment. In a poorly constructed mainstreamed environment, fostering relationships with classmates may be difficult and auditory important material shared verbally by teachers may be missed. As a result, the child may fall behind both academically and socially. In residential school settings, these challenges may not be experienced to the same degree, and would allow for deaf children&#x27;s social and academic lives to instead flourish.

== Medical Model ==

The medical model of deafness originates from medical, social welfare and majority cultural notions of the absence of the ability to hear as being an illness or a physical disability. It stems from a more comprehensive and far-reaching medical model of disability. Under the perspective that deafness is an impairment, the inability to hear interferes with a person&#x27;s ability to respond to environmental cues, to communicate, and to enjoy aspects of mainstream culture such as music. People who experience hearing loss after acquiring a mastery of spoken language as well as those who are hard-of-hearing commonly identify with this model.

Within the medical model deafness is conceptualized from a &quot;personal tragedy&quot; stance, indicating that it should be avoided, eradicated, or normalized by all possible means. Often, the attitudes of professionals own assumptions of deafness as tragedy promote responses of loss; thus, hearing parents may experience diagnosis of their child&#x27;s deafness as a tragedy with reactions of grief. Similarly, common reactions such as stress and anger are not necessarily understandable psychological responses to deafness, but may result from situations in which parents have not encountered in others an adequate response to their needs and questions.

While medical ethics and law dictate that it is up to the patient (or the patient&#x27;s legal representative) to decide the treatments he or she wishes, the press and professional literature are increasingly normalizing the discussion regarding using cochlear implants, oral education, and mainstream placement; all being popular choices under the medical model of deafness. The medical model suggests that, overall, the effects of deafness may be lessened through the use of technology such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, assistive listening devices, and lip reading. Similarly, doctors and scientists who engage in research are doing so simply because there is demand for information and for techniques which can restore hearing. The view that deafness is a &quot;disability&quot; also has economic consequences in political environments concerned with social welfare. It is the basis on which the governments in many developed countries provide financial support for the cost of cochlear implants and other therapies.

Under the medical model of deafness, implicit questions may naturally arise, such as: &quot;By what criteria and by whom is the impairment construed as an infirmity; how did the infirmity arise; what are the risks and benefits of the available treatment, if any; what can be done to minimize the disabling effects of the infirmity?&quot;

<text>Eschscholzia californica, the California poppy, golden poppy, California sunlight or cup of gold, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae, native to the United States and Mexico. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant flowering in summer (spring in southern Australia), with showy flowers in brilliant shades of red, orange and yellow (occasionally pink and white). It is also used as food or a garnish. It had various uses in indigenous herbalism. It became the official state flower of California in 1903.

==Description==

California poppy is a perennial or annual plant growing to tall with alternately branching glaucous blue-green foliage. The leaves are alternately divided into round, lobed segments. The flowers are solitary on long stems, silky-textured, with four petals, each petal long and broad; flower color ranges through yellow, orange and red. Flowering occurs from February to September in the northern hemisphere. The petals close at night (or in cold, windy weather) and open again the following morning, although they may remain closed in cloudy weather. The fruit is a slender, dehiscent capsule long, which splits in two, sometimes explosively with an audible snap, to release numerous small wide black or dark brown seeds. The plant will reseed under ideal conditions, or when winters are cold. Anecdotally, it can be an aggressive reseeder in the home garden context, eventually becoming a groundcover. It survives mild winters in its native range, dying completely in colder climates.

===Habitat===

Its native habitat includes California and extends to Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora and northwest Baja California. The Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve is located in northern Los Angeles County. At the peak of the blooming season, orange flowers seem to cover all 1,745 acres (706 ha) of the reserve. Other prominent locations of California poppy meadows include Bear Valley (Colusa County) and Point Buchon (San Luis Obispo County).

===Taxonomy===
&quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot; was the first named species of the genus &quot;Eschscholzia&quot;, named by the German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso after the Baltic German botanist Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, his friend and colleague on Otto von Kotzebue&#x27;s scientific expedition to California and the greater Pacific circa 1810 aboard the Russian ship &quot;Rurik&quot;.

California poppy is highly variable, with over 90 synonyms. Some botanists accept two subspecies—one with four varieties (e.g., )—though others do not recognize them as distinct (e.g., ):
*&quot;E. californica&quot; subsp. &quot;californica&quot;, native to California, Baja California, and Oregon, widely planted as an ornamental, and an invasive elsewhere (see below).
**&quot;E. californica&quot; subsp. &quot;californica&quot; var. &quot;californica&quot;, which is found along the coast from the San Francisco Peninsula north. They are perennial and somewhat prostrate, with yellow flowers.
**&quot;E. californica&quot; subsp. &quot;californica&quot; var. &quot;maritima&quot; (E. L. Greene) Jeps., which is found along the coast from Monterey south to San Miguel Island. They are perennial, long-lived, glaucous, short in stature, and have extremely prostrate growth and yellow flowers.
**&quot;E. californica&quot; subsp. &quot;californica&quot; var. &quot;crocea&quot; (Benth.) Jeps., which grows in non-arid inland regions. They are perennial, taller, and have orange flowers.
**&quot;E. California&quot; subsp. &quot;californica&quot; var. &quot;peninsularis&quot; (E. L. Greene) Munz, which is an annual or facultative annual growing in arid inland environments.
*&quot;E. californica&quot; subsp. &quot;mexicana&quot; (E. L. Greene) and Curtis Clark, the &quot;Mexican gold poppy&quot;, which is found in the Sonoran Desert. Some authorities refer to it as &quot;E. Mexicana.&quot; These variations in features among Eschscholzia species have led to inconsistencies in species descriptions and identifications. This variation, both within and between species, triggered a surge in Eschscholzia species descriptions, reaching 112 taxa in the early part of the last century. Currently, there are 189 taxonomic descriptions at the species level and below, with 159 type specimens scattered across global herbaria. The shift in recognizing poppy species, known as the &quot;Greene Revolution&quot;, initiated a significant reduction in recognized species. Willis Lynn Jepson played a pivotal role by considering the majority of described taxa as mere environmental variations. In his book &quot;A Flora of California&quot;, published in 1922, he consolidated many of the taxa into &quot;Eschscholtzia californica&quot; and reduced the total number of taxa within the greater &quot;Eschscholtzia&quot; genus from around 120 to 12.

Botanical research has held significant implications towards the classification of &quot;Eschscholzia&quot;. Despite some unresolved aspects in the phylogenies, it is evident that taxonomic are necessary within the genus, particularly in three areas: supporting two subspecies of &quot;E. californica&quot;, endorsing two subspecies of &quot;E. lemmonii&quot;, and recognizing two potential new taxa. Currently, 8 taxa are officially recognized.

It belongs to the subfamily &quot;Eschscholzioideae&quot;, sister group to the subfamily &quot;Papaveroideae&quot; (which includes &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;, the opium poppy).

==Pollen ==
As poppies are not wind-pollinated, their pollen poses no allergy risk via inhalation.

A UK study of meadow flowers including commercial mixes and common plants such as ragwort and dandelion ranked the California poppy highly in pollen production, although it did not produce a significant amount of nectar. On a per-flower basis it ranked second, with a rate of 8.3 ± 1.1μl. The corn poppy, &quot;Papaver rhoeas&quot;, topped the list for per-flower pollen production with its rate of 13.3 ± 2.8μl. When measuring the entire capitulum the top two species were the ox-eye daisy, &quot;Leucanthemum vulgare&quot;, with 15.9 ± 2μl, and &quot;Cosmos bipinnatus&quot;, which had a rate nearly equivalent to that of the corn poppy.

== Historical and cultural significance ==

In the late 1700s, Spanish settlers affectionately called the poppy &quot;copa de oro&quot; (gold cup). By 1816, Russian explorers officially named the flower &quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;. Since California&#x27;s statehood in 1850, local residents have embraced it as the California poppy or &quot;golden poppy&quot;.

Several years later, Chamisso introduced the wildflower through a detailed description and life-sized color painting in &quot;Horae Physicae Berolinenses&quot; (1820). This marked the entry of the poppy into European taxonomic systems as &quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;. The living flower made its European debut in 1826, courtesy of Scottish botanist David Douglas, who collected various plant seeds, including &quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;, for the Royal Horticultural Society of England. While evidence indicates that the golden poppy started appearing in British gardens over the subsequent fifty years, it had not yet become strongly associated with ideas of California identity and statehood. An 1883 Scottish report, recounting a visit to California and an encounter with the golden wildflowers, reflects the early attitudes forming around the poppy.

By the 1890s, &quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot; had transformed from merely the California or golden poppy to the designated state poppy– a shift from a botanical specimen with regional ties to a symbol of the state.

=== Connection to indigenous tribes ===
The California poppy has been historically used as traditional medicine and cosmetics by some indigenous people in California, particularly those native to the regions where the plant is found. In particular, Tongva Gabrielino, Cahuilla, Costanoan, Luiseno, and Pomo have cultural and historical connections with the poppy. These connections involve traditional uses of the plant, cultural significance, and even folklore. While indigenous communities have nurtured the land for generations, establishing ecological conditions conducive to wildflower growth, colonial settlers and their governing structures found the native flower&#x27;s status as a genuine and intrinsic product of the land appealing.

=== Tongva (Garbrielino tribe) ===
In the 19th century, the California poppy held a dual identity, both as a botanical native and as a symbolic representation of California. It was crafted to embody the essence of a &quot;true&quot; Californian, celebrated and used predominantly by the white Californian community. The Native Daughters and Sons of the Golden West played a pivotal role in establishing the California poppy as a cultural icon.

In contrast, the Tongva peoples of the San Gabriel Valley region recognized the California poppy by the term, &quot;Mekachaa.&quot; Such indigenous communities interpret the Mekechaa as a plant relative, and actively resisted attempts to appropriate its existence through artistic community projects. In &quot;Waa&#x27;aka&#x27;,&quot; the final plant created by the Tongva&#x27;s god of creation, &quot;Wiyot&quot;, was the &quot;Island poppy&quot;, described as &quot;&quot;golden as the sun, bringing beauty to the world&quot;.&quot;

==Uses==
California poppy leaves are used as food or garnish, while the seeds are used in cooking. There are no clinical trials showing it can effectively treat psychiatric disorders in humans.

=== Chemical compounds ===
&quot;E. californica&quot; contains californidine (N+(CH3)2), allocryptopine, eschscholtzine N-CH3 (californidine), and other similar (Papaveraceae) alkaloids. Also berberine.

==== Preparation ====
The California poppy has been used through two methods: fresh petals to create a syrup, and dried petals added to water to make an infusion or boiled for tea.

==Cultivation==
&quot;E. californica&quot; is drought-tolerant, self-seeding, and easy to cultivate. It is best grown as an annual, in full sun, and well-draining sandy or loam soil. Horticulturalists have produced numerous cultivars with a range of colors and blossom and stem forms. These typically do not breed true on reseeding. Seeds are often sold as mixtures. The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:- 
*&#x27;Apricot chiffon&#x27; (yellow flushed with pink and orange)
*&#x27;Dali&#x27; (red)
*&#x27;Rose chiffon&#x27; (pink and white)
==As an introduced species==
California poppies are commercially sold and widely naturalized in Australia, including Tasmania, and the species has also been introduced to South Africa, Chile, New Zealand, and Argentina. In both Chile and California, there are marked differences between California poppies grown in low and high altitudes. Coastal or low-altitude specimens produce fewer flowers and seeds, experience longer flowering times, and have shorter stems.

==State flower of California==
During the 1890s Sarah Plummer Lemmon advocated for the adoption of the golden poppy as the state flower of California, eventually writing the bill passed by the California Legislature and signed by Governor George Pardee in 1903. In this era, the state aimed to construct an external identity grounded in the natural wealth of the region, enticing newcomers and businesses with promises of celebration and prosperity. Publicly, products synonymous with the color gold, such as oranges, wheat, actual gold, and the iconic golden poppy, were strategically employed as influential elements in the endeavor to shape and promote the state.

The designation of the California poppy as the state flower was influenced by a convergence of cultural, social, and political factors aimed at defining and affirming the identity of the colonial state. Asserting claims of communal identity, white settlers orchestrated a movement to construct a cultural identity centered around the golden poppy.

In the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, the California poppy became a central design motif and symbol influencing various decorative objects. Such decorative objects featured California scenes and prominently showcased the California poppy symbolizing the imagined, pastoral and prosperous California that artists sought to create.

A particular example is a wooden box painted by Lucia Mathews in 1929, this box serves as a visual representation of the symbiotic relationship between the poppy and California, reinforcing the state&#x27;s identity through design. As the official state flower of California, &quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot; is pictured on welcome signs along highways entering California and on official Scenic Route signs.

In March 2019, a &quot;super bloom&quot; of California poppies in the city of Lake Elsinore, California, drew nationwide attention. So-called super blooms occur after a period of heavy rainfall and often draw large crowds. The most popular sightseeing spot, Walker Canyon, was overwhelmed by more than 100,000 visitors in the span of a few days, causing city officials to temporarily shut down surrounding roads to motor vehicles.

<text>The Eleusinian Mysteries () were initiations held every year for the cult of Demeter and Persephone based at the Panhellenic Sanctuary of Eleusis in ancient Greece. They are considered the &quot;most famous of the secret religious rites of ancient Greece&quot;. Their basis was a Bronze Age agrarian cult, and there is some evidence that they were derived from the religious practices of the Mycenean period. The Mysteries represented the myth of the abduction of Persephone from her mother Demeter by the king of the underworld Hades, in a cycle with three phases: the &quot;descent&quot; (loss), the &quot;search&quot;, and the &quot;ascent&quot;, with the main theme being the &quot;ascent&quot; () of Persephone and the reunion with her mother. It was a major festival during the Hellenic era, and later spread to Rome. Similar religious rites appear in the agricultural societies of the Near East and in Minoan Crete.

The rites, ceremonies, and beliefs were kept secret and consistently preserved from antiquity. For the initiated, the rebirth of Persephone symbolized the eternity of life which flows from generation to generation, and they believed that they would have a reward in the afterlife. There are many paintings and pieces of pottery that depict various aspects of the Mysteries. Since the Mysteries involved visions and conjuring of an afterlife, some scholars believe that the power and longevity of the Eleusinian Mysteries, a consistent set of rites, ceremonies and experiences that spanned two millennia, came from psychedelic drugs . The name of the town, Eleusis, seems to be pre-Greek, and is likely a counterpart with Elysium and the goddess Eileithyia.

==Etymology==
&quot;Eleusinian Mysteries&quot; () was the name of the &quot;mysteries&quot; of the city &quot;Eleusis&quot;.

The name of the city Eleusis is Pre-Greek, and may be related with the name of the goddess Eileithyia. Her name &quot;&quot; (&quot;Elysia&quot;) in Laconia and Messene probably relates her with the month &quot;Eleusinios&quot; and Eleusis, but this is debated.

The ancient Greek word from which English &quot;mystery&quot; derives, &quot;mystḗrion&quot; (), means &quot;mystery or secret rite&quot; and is related with the verb &quot;myéō&quot; (), which means &quot;(I) teach, initiate into the mysteries&quot;, and the noun &quot;mýstēs&quot; (), which means &quot;one initiated&quot;. The word &quot;mystikós&quot; (), source of the English &quot;mystic&quot;, means &quot;connected with the mysteries&quot;, or &quot;private, secret&quot; (as in Modern Greek).

==Demeter and Persephone==
The Mysteries are related to a myth concerning Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and fertility as recounted in one of the Homeric Hymns (c. 650 BC). According to the hymn, Demeter&#x27;s daughter Persephone (also referred to as &quot;Kore&quot;, &quot;maiden&quot;) was assigned the task of painting all the flowers of the earth. Before completion, she was seized by Hades, the god of the underworld, who took her to his underworld kingdom. Distraught, Demeter searched high and low for her daughter. Because of her distress, and in an effort to coerce Zeus to allow the return of her daughter, she caused a terrible drought in which the people suffered and starved, depriving the gods of sacrifice and worship. As a result, Zeus relented and allowed Persephone to return to her mother.

According to the myth, during her search Demeter traveled long distances and had many minor adventures along the way. In one she taught the secrets of agriculture to Triptolemus. Finally, by consulting Zeus, Demeter reunited with her daughter and the earth returned to its former verdure and prosperity: the first spring.

Zeus, pressed by the cries of the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever consumed food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who had been sent to retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds (either six or four according to the telling), which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six or four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother for the rest of the year. This left a long period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone&#x27;s absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again.

In the central foundation document of the mystery, the Homeric &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot; line 415, Persephone is said to stay in Hades during winter and return to her mother in the spring of the year: &quot;This was the day [of Persephone&#x27;s return], at the very beginning of bountiful springtime.&quot;

Persephone&#x27;s rebirth is symbolic of the rebirth of all plant life and the symbol of eternity of life that flows from the generations that spring from each other.

However, a scholar has proposed a different version, according to which the four months during which Persephone is with Hades correspond to the dry Greek summer, a period during which plants are threatened with drought.

==Mysteries==
The Eleusinian Mysteries are believed to have ancient origins. Some findings in the temple &quot;Eleusinion&quot; in Attica suggest that their basis was an old agrarian cult. Some practices of the mysteries seem to have been influenced by the religious practices of the Mycenaean period, thus predating the Greek Dark Ages. Excavations showed that a private building existed under the Telesterion in the Mycenean period, and it seems that originally the cult of Demeter was private. In the Homeric Hymn is mentioned the palace of the king Keleos.
One line of thought by modern scholars has been that the Mysteries were intended &quot;to elevate man above the human sphere into the divine and to assure his redemption by making him a god and so conferring immortality upon him&quot;.

Some scholars argued that the Eleusinian cult was a continuation of a Minoan cult, and that Demeter was a poppy goddess who brought the poppy from Crete to Eleusis. Some useful information from the Mycenean period can be taken from the study of the cult of Despoina (the precursor goddess of Persephone) and the cult of Eileithyia, who was the goddess of childbirth. The megaron of Despoina at Lycosura is quite similar to the Telesterion of Eleusis, and Demeter is united with the god Poseidon, bearing a daughter, the unnamable &quot;Despoina&quot; (the mistress). In the cave of Amnisos at Crete, the goddess Eileithyia is related with the annual birth of the divine child, and she is connected with &quot;Enesidaon &quot; (The Earth Shaker), who is the chthonic aspect of Poseidon.

At Eleusis inscriptions refer to &quot;the Goddesses&quot; accompanied by the agricultural god Triptolemus (probably son of Ge and Oceanus), and &quot;the God and the Goddess&quot; (Persephone and Plouton) accompanied by Eubuleus who probably led the way back from the underworld. The myth was represented in a cycle with three phases: the &quot;descent&quot;, the &quot;search&quot;, and the &quot;ascent&quot; (Greek &quot;anodos&quot;) with contrasted emotions from sorrow to joy which roused the &quot;mystae&quot; to exultation.

The main theme was the ascent of Persephone and the reunion with her mother Demeter. At the beginning of the feast, the priests filled two special vessels and poured them out, one towards the west and the other towards the east. The people looking both to the sky and the earth shouted in a magical rhyme &quot;rain and conceive&quot;. In a ritual, a child was initiated from the hearth (the divine fire). The name &quot;pais&quot; (child) appears in the Mycenean inscriptions, it was the ritual of the &quot;divine child&quot; who originally was Ploutos. In the Homeric hymn the ritual is connected with the myth of the agricultural god Triptolemus. The goddess of nature survived in the mysteries where the following words were uttered: &quot;Mighty Potnia bore a great son&quot;. Potnia (Linear B &quot;po-ti-ni-ja&quot; : lady or mistress), is a Mycenaean title applied to goddesses, and probably the translation of a similar title of pre-Greek origin.

The high point of the celebration was &quot;an ear of grain cut in silence&quot;, which represented the force of the new life. The idea of immortality did not exist in the mysteries at the beginning, but the initiated believed that they would have a better fate in the underworld. Death remained a reality, but at the same time a new beginning like the plant which grows from the buried seed. A depiction from the old palace of Phaistos is very close to the image of the &quot;anodos&quot; of Persephone. An armless and legless deity grows out of the ground, and her head turns to a large flower.

According to George Mylonas, the lesser mysteries were held &quot;as a rule once a year in the early spring in the month of flowers, the Anthesterion,&quot; while &quot;the Greater Mysteries were held once a year and every fourth year they were celebrated with special splendor in what was known as the &quot;penteteris&quot;. Kerényi concurs with this assessment: &quot;The Lesser Mysteries were held at Agrai in the month of Anthesterion, our February... The initiates were not even admitted to the &quot;epopteia&quot; [Greater Mysteries] in the same year, but only in September of the following year.&quot; This cycle continued for about two millennia. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, King Celeus is said to have been one of the first people to learn the secret rites and mysteries of her cult. He was also one of her original priests, along with Diocles, Eumolpos, Polyxeinus, and Triptolemus, Celeus&#x27; son, who had supposedly learned agriculture from Demeter.

Under Peisistratos of Athens, the Eleusinian Mysteries became pan-Hellenic, and pilgrims flocked from Greece and beyond to participate. Around 300 BC, the state took over control of the mysteries; they were controlled by two families, the Eumolpidae and the Kerykes. This led to a vast increase in the number of initiates. The only requirements for membership were freedom from &quot;blood guilt&quot;, meaning never having committed murder, and not being a &quot;barbarian&quot; (being unable to speak Greek). Men, women, and even slaves were allowed initiation.

===Participants===
To participate in these mysteries one had to swear a vow of secrecy.

Four categories of people participated in the Eleusinian Mysteries:
*Priests, priestesses, and hierophants
*Those who had attained &quot;épopteia&quot; (Greek: ἐποπτεία) (contemplation), who had learned the secrets of the greatest mysteries of Demeter
* Those who had already participated at least once – they were eligible for attaining &quot;épopteia&quot;
* Initiates, undergoing the ceremony for the first time

===Priesthood===
The priesthood officiating at the Eleusinian Mysteries and in the sanctuary was divided into several offices with different tasks.

Six categories of priests officiated in the Eleusinian Mysteries:

* &quot;Hierophantes&quot; – male high priest, an office inherited within the Phileidae or Eumolpidae families.
* &quot;High Priestess of Demeter&quot; or &quot;Priestess of Demeter and Kore&quot; – an office inherited within the Phileidae or Eumolpidae families.
* &quot;Dadouchos&quot; – men serving as torch bearers, the second-highest male role next to &quot;Hierophantes&quot;. 
* &quot;Dadouchousa Priestess&quot; – a female priestess who assisted the Dadouchos, an office inherited within the Phileidae or Eumolpidae families.
* &quot;Hierophantides&quot; – two married priestesses, one serving Demeter, and the other Persephone. 
* &quot;Panageis&quot; (&#x27;the holy&#x27;) or &quot;melissae&quot; (&#x27;bees&#x27;) – a group of priestesses who lived a life secluded from men.

The offices of Hierophant, High Priestess, and Dadouchousa priestess were all inherited within the Phileidae or Eumolpidae families, and the Hierophant and the High Priestess were of equal rank. It was the task of the High Priestess to impersonate the roles of the goddesses Demeter and Persephone in the enactment during the mysteries, and at Eleusis events were dated by the name of the reigning High Priestess.

===Secrets===
The outline below is only a capsule summary; much of the concrete information about the Eleusinian Mysteries was never written down. For example, only initiates knew what the &quot;kiste&quot;, a sacred chest, and the &quot;calathus&quot;, a lidded basket, contained.

Hippolytus of Rome, one of the Church Fathers writing in the early 3rd century AD, discloses in &quot;Refutation of All Heresies&quot; that &quot;the Athenians, while initiating people into the Eleusinian rites, likewise display to those who are being admitted to the highest grade at these mysteries, the mighty, and marvellous, and most perfect secret suitable for one initiated into the highest mystic truths: &quot;an ear of grain in silence reaped&quot;.&quot;

===Lesser Mysteries===
There were two Eleusinian Mysteries, the Greater and the Lesser. According to Thomas Taylor, &quot;the dramatic shows of the Lesser Mysteries occultly signified the miseries of the soul while in subjection to the body, so those of the Greater obscurely intimated, by mystic and splendid visions, the felicity of the soul both here and hereafter, when purified from the defilements of a material nature and constantly elevated to the realities of intellectual [spiritual] vision.&quot; According to Plato, &quot;the ultimate design of the Mysteries ... was to lead us back to the principles from which we descended, ... a perfect enjoyment of intellectual [spiritual] good.&quot;

The Lesser Mysteries took place in the month of Anthesterion – the eighth month of the Attic calendar, falling in mid winter around February or March – under the direction of Athens&#x27; &quot;archon basileus&quot;. In order to qualify for initiation, participants would sacrifice a piglet to Demeter and Persephone, and then ritually purify themselves in the river Illisos. Upon completion of the Lesser Mysteries, participants were deemed &quot;mystai&quot; (initiates) worthy of witnessing the Greater Mysteries.

===Greater Mysteries===

The Greater Mysteries took place in Boedromion – the third month of the Attic calendar, falling in late summer around September or October – and lasted ten days.

The first act (on the 14th of Boedromion) was the bringing of the sacred objects from Eleusis to the Eleusinion, a temple at the base of the Acropolis of Athens.

On the 15th of Boedromion, a day called the Gathering (&quot;Agyrmos&quot;), the priests (&quot;hierophantes&quot;, those who show the sacred ones) declared the start of the rites (&quot;prorrhesis&quot;), and carried out the sacrifice (&quot;hiereía deúro,&quot; hither the victims).

The seawards initiates (&quot;halade mystai&quot;) started out in Athens on 16th Boedromion with the celebrants washing themselves in the sea at Phaleron.

On the 17th, the participants began the &quot;Epidauria&quot;, a festival for Asklepios named after his main sanctuary at Epidauros. This &quot;festival within a festival&quot; celebrated the healer&#x27;s arrival at Athens with his daughter Hygieia, and consisted of a procession leading to the Eleusinion, during which the &quot;mystai&quot; apparently stayed at home, a great sacrifice, and an all-night feast (&quot;pannykhís&quot;).

The procession to Eleusis began at Kerameikos (the Athenian cemetery) on the 18th, and from there the people walked to Eleusis, along the Sacred Way (Ἱερὰ Ὁδός, &quot;Hierá Hodós&quot;), swinging branches called &quot;bacchoi&quot;. At a certain spot along the way, they shouted obscenities in commemoration of Iambe (or Baubo), an old woman who, by cracking dirty jokes, had made Demeter smile as she mourned the loss of her daughter. The procession also shouted &quot;Íakch&#x27;, O Íakche!&quot;, possibly an epithet for Dionysus, or a separate deity Iacchus, son of Persephone or Demeter.

Upon reaching Eleusis, there was an all-night vigil (&quot;pannychis&quot;) according to Mylonas and Kerényi. perhaps commemorating Demeter&#x27;s search for Persephone. At some point, initiates had a special drink (&quot;kykeon&quot;), of barley and pennyroyal, which has led to speculation about its chemicals perhaps having psychotropic effects from ergot (a fungus that grows on barley, containing psychedelic alkaloids similar to LSD). Discovery of fragments of ergot in a temple dedicated to the two Eleusinian goddesses excavated at the Mas Castellar site (Girona, Spain) provided legitimacy for this theory. Ergot fragments were found inside a vase and within the dental calculus (plaque) of a 25-year-old man, providing evidence of ergot being consumed (Juan-Stresserras, 2002). This finding seems to support the hypothesis of ergot as an ingredient of the Eleusinian kykeon.

==== Inside the Telesterion ====

On the 19th of Boedromion, initiates entered a great hall called Telesterion; in the center stood the Palace (&quot;Anaktoron&quot;), built of ruins dating back to the Mycenaean Age, which only the hierophants could enter, where sacred objects were stored. Before mystai could enter the Telesterion, they would recite, &quot;I have fasted, I have drunk the &quot;kykeon&quot;, I have taken from the &quot;kiste&quot; (box) and after working it have put it back in the &quot;calathus&quot; (open basket).

It is widely supposed that the rites inside the Telesterion comprised three elements:

* &quot;dromena&quot; (things done), a dramatic reenactment of the Demeter/Persephone myth
* &quot;deiknumena&quot; (things shown), displayed sacred objects, in which the hierophant played an essential role
* &quot;legomena&quot; (things said), commentaries that accompanied the &quot;deiknumena&quot;

Combined, these three elements were known as the &quot;aporrheta&quot; (unrepeatables); the penalty for divulging them was death.

Athenagoras of Athens, Cicero, and other ancient writers cite that it was for this crime (among others) that Diagoras was condemned to death in Athens; the tragic playwright Aeschylus was allegedly tried for revealing secrets of the mysteries in some of his plays, but was acquitted. The ban on divulging the core ritual of the mysteries was thus absolute, which is probably why almost nothing is known about what transpired there.

Climax

As to the climax of the mysteries, there are two modern theories.

Some hold that the priests were the ones to reveal the visions of the holy night, consisting of a fire that represented the possibility of life after death, and various sacred objects. Others hold this explanation to be insufficient to account for the power and longevity of the mysteries, and that the experiences must have been internal and mediated by a powerful psychoactive ingredient contained in the &quot;kykeon&quot; drink (see Entheogenic theories below). Although this hypothesis continues to receive attention, it was not well received by classicists

Following this section of the Mysteries was an all-night feast (&quot;Pannychis&quot;) accompanied by dancing and merriment. This portion of the festivities was open to the public. The dances took place in the Rarian Field, rumored to be the first spot where grain grew. A bull sacrifice also took place late that night or early the next morning. That day (22nd Boedromion), the initiates honoured the dead by pouring libations from special vessels.

On the 23rd of Boedromion, the mysteries ended and everyone returned home.

==Demise==
In 170 AD, the Temple of Demeter was sacked by the Sarmatians but was rebuilt by Marcus Aurelius. Aurelius was then allowed to become the only lay person ever to enter the anaktoron. As Christianity gained in popularity in the 4th and 5th centuries, Eleusis&#x27;s prestige began to fade. The last pagan emperor of Rome, Julian, reigned from 361 to 363 after about fifty years of Christian rule. Julian attempted to restore the Eleusinian Mysteries and was the last emperor to be initiated into them. The closing of the Eleusinian Mysteries in 392 AD by the emperor Theodosius I is reported by Eunapius, a historian and biographer of the Greek philosophers. Eunapius had been initiated by the last legitimate Hierophant, who had been commissioned by the emperor Julian to restore the Mysteries, which had by then fallen into decay. According to Eunapius, the last Hierophant was a usurper, &quot;the man from Thespiae who held the rank of Father in the mysteries of Mithras&quot;. According to Eunapius, in 396, during his raiding campaign in Attica, the king of the Goths Alaric I looted the remains of the shrines.

According to historian Hans Kloft, despite the destruction of the Eleusinian Mysteries, elements of the cult survived in the Greek countryside. There, local peasants and shepherds partially transferred Demeter&#x27;s rites and religious duties onto Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki, who gradually became the local patron of agriculture and &quot;heir&quot; to the pagan mother goddess.

==In art, literature, and culture==

There are many paintings and pieces of pottery that depict various aspects of the Mysteries. The &quot;Eleusinian Relief&quot;, from the late 5th century BC, displayed in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens is a representative example. Triptolemus is depicted receiving seeds from Demeter and teaching mankind how to work the fields to grow crops, with Persephone holding her hand over his head to protect him. Vases and other works of relief sculpture, from the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries BC, depict Triptolemus holding an ear of corn, sitting on a winged throne or chariot, surrounded by Persephone and Demeter with pine torches. The monumental Protoattic amphora from the middle of the 7th century BC, with the depiction of Medusa&#x27;s beheading by Perseus and the blinding of Polyphemos by Odysseus and his companions on its neck, is kept in the Archaeological Museum of Eleusis which is located inside the archaeological site of Eleusis.

The Ninnion Tablet, found in the same museum, depicts Demeter, followed by Persephone and Iacchus, and then the procession of initiates. Then, Demeter is sitting on the kiste inside the Telesterion, with Persephone holding a torch and introducing the initiates. The initiates each hold a bacchoi. The second row of initiates were led by Iakchos, a priest who held torches for the ceremonies. He is standing near the omphalos while an unknown female (probably a priestess of Demeter) sat nearby on the kiste, holding a scepter and a vessel filled with kykeon. Pannychis is also represented.

&quot;The Myth of Er&quot;, part of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, is thought to be a representation of the teaching of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Er, after being killed in battle and brought to the underworld, is reincarnated without drinking from the River Lethe. He retains his memories and tells the living about his experience in the underworld. He no longer has a fear of death.

In &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Mystery Play: A Study of The Tempest&quot;, Colin Still argued that &quot;The Tempest&quot; was an allegory for initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries. Though widely rejected, this interpretation was supported by Michael Srigley in &quot;Images of Regeneration&quot;.

Carl Gustav Jung (1875–1961) borrowed terms and interpretations from the late 19th and early 20th century classical scholarship in German and French as a source of metaphors for his reframing of psychoanalytic treatment into a spiritualistic ritual of initiation and rebirth. The Eleusinian mysteries, particularly the qualities of the Kore, figured prominently in his writings.

Dimitris Lyacos in the second book of the &quot;Poena Damni&quot; trilogy &quot;With the People from the Bridge&quot;, a contemporary, avant-garde play focusing on the return of the dead and the revenant legend combines elements from the Eleusinian mysteries as well as early Christian tradition in order to convey a view of collective salvation. The text uses the pomegranate symbol in order to hint at the residence of the dead in the underworld and their periodical return to the world of the living.

Octavio Vazquez&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Eleusis&quot; draws on the Eleusinian Mysteries and on other Western esoteric traditions. Commissioned by the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores and the RTVE Symphony Orchestra, it was premiered in 2015 by the RTVE Orchestra and conductor Adrian Leaper at the Teatro Monumental in Madrid.

==Entheogenic theories==
Numerous scholars have proposed that the power of the Eleusinian Mysteries came from the kykeon&#x27;s functioning as an entheogen, or psychedelic agent. The use of potions or philtres for magical or religious purposes was relatively common in Greece and the ancient world. The initiates, sensitized by their fast and prepared by preceding ceremonies (see set and setting), may have been propelled by the effects of a powerful psychoactive potion into revelatory mind states with profound spiritual and intellectual ramifications. In opposition to this idea, skeptical scholars note the lack of any solid evidence and stress the collective rather than individual character of initiation into the Mysteries. 

Many psychoactive agents have been proposed as the significant element of kykeon, though without consensus or conclusive evidence. These include the ergot species , a fungal parasite of paspalum, which contains the alkaloids ergotamine, a precursor to LSD, and ergonovine. However, modern attempts to prepare a kykeon using ergot-parasitized barley have yielded inconclusive results, though Alexander Shulgin and Ann Shulgin describe ergonovine and LSA to be known to produce LSD-like effects.

Discovery of fragments of ergot (fungi containing LSD-like psychedelic alkaloids) in a temple dedicated to the two Eleusinian Goddesses excavated at the Mas Castellar site (Girona, Spain) provided some legitimacy for this theory. Ergot fragments were found inside a vase and within the dental calculus of a 25-year-old man, providing evidence of ergot being consumed. This finding seems to support the hypothesis of ergot as an ingredient of the Eleusinian kykeon.

Psychoactive mushrooms are another candidate. Scholars such as Robert Graves and Terence McKenna, speculated that the mysteries were focused around a variety of &quot;Psilocybe&quot;. Other entheogenic fungi, such as &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;, have also been suggested. A recent hypothesis suggests that the ancient Egyptians cultivated &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; on barley and associated it with the deity Osiris.

Another candidate for the psychoactive drug is an opioid derived from the poppy. The cult of the goddess Demeter may have brought the poppy from Crete to Eleusis; it is certain that opium was produced in Crete.

Another theory is that the psychoactive agent in kykeon is DMT, which occurs in many wild plants of the Mediterranean, including &quot;Phalaris&quot; and/or &quot;Acacia&quot;. To be active orally (like in ayahuasca) it must be combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor such as Syrian rue (&quot;Peganum harmala&quot;), which grows throughout the Mediterranean.

Alternatively, J. Nigro Sansonese (1994), using the mythography supplied by Mylonas, hypothesizes that the Mysteries of Eleusis were a series of practical initiations into trance involving proprioception of the human nervous system induced by breath control (similar to samyama in yoga). Sansonese speculates that the &quot;kisté&quot;, a box holding sacred objects opened by the hierophant, is actually an esoteric reference to the initiate&#x27;s skull, within which is seen a sacred light and are heard sacred sounds, but only &quot;after&quot; instruction in trance practice. Similarly, the seed-filled chambers of a pomegranate, a fruit associated with the founding of the cult, esoterically describe proprioception of the initiate&#x27;s heart during trance.

<text>Gero von Wilpert (13 March 1933 – 24 December 2009) was a German author, a senior lecturer in German at the University of New South Wales and, from 1980, Professor of German at the University of Sydney.

==Life and career==
Wilpert was born in Tartu (Dorpat), Estonia. Like all Baltic Germans, he was forced to leave Estonia after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the takeover of the country by the Soviet Union (1939–40).

From 1953 to 1957 he studied at the University of Heidelberg, where he was at times a docent. He then settled near Stuttgart to work as independent author and lecturer.

Wilpert published several editions of an encyclopedia of literary descriptions &quot;Sachwörterbuch der Literatur&quot;. He also wrote a comprehensive &quot;Lexikon der Weltliteratur&quot; [Lexicon of World Literature] and earlier had published his &quot;Deutsche Literatur in Bildern&quot; [German Literature in Pictures] and a journal on Schiller.

He was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 1983.

Wilpert died in Sydney.

<text>Shiritori (; ) is a Japanese word game in which the players are required to say a word which begins with the final &quot;kana&quot; of the previous word. No distinction is made between &quot;hiragana&quot;, &quot;katakana&quot;, and &quot;kanji&quot;. &quot;Shiritori&quot; literally means &quot;taking the end&quot; or &quot;taking the rear&quot;.

==Rules==
There are various optional and advanced rules, which the players must agree on before the game begins.
===Standard rules===
*Two or more people take turns to play.
*Only nouns are permitted.
*A player who plays a word ending in the &quot;mora&quot; &quot;N&quot; () loses the game, as almost no Japanese word begins with that character, except for some loanwords and proper nouns such as (N&#x27;Djamena).
*Words may not be repeated.
*Phrases connected by &quot;no&quot; (; meaning roughly &quot;of&quot;) are permitted, but only in those cases where the phrase is sufficiently lexicalized to be considered a &quot;word&quot;.

Example:&quot;sakura&quot; () → &quot;rajio&quot; () → &quot;onigiri&quot; () → &quot;risu&quot; () → &quot;sumou&quot; () → &quot;udon&quot; ().The player who used the word &quot;udon&quot; lost this game, because the word ends in &quot;N&quot; ().

===Optional rules===
*The first word of the game is &quot;shiritori&quot;, the name of the game itself.
*Dakuten and handakuten may be ignored or added. Thus &quot;suupu&quot; () may be followed by &quot;furo&quot; (), and &quot;sato&quot; () may be followed by &quot;dorayaki&quot; ().
*A long vowel may either be ignored or considered as a vowel. &quot;Mikisaa&quot; (/) can be followed by either &quot;sakura&quot; () or &quot;aki&quot; ().
*Common pronouns and place names may be permitted. Example: &quot;Edo jou&quot; (, ), is acceptable.
*Two words spelled with the same &quot;kana&quot; but different &quot;kanji&quot; may be permitted. For example, &quot;su&quot; () can either be spelled as &quot; () or &quot; ().

===Advanced rules===
*Words are limited to a certain genre.
*Instead of using only the last &quot;kana&quot;, the final two &quot;kana&quot; must be used again. In this case only the first &quot;kana&quot; may not be the &quot;mora&quot; &quot;N&quot; ().
*The length of a word must be three or more syllables.

==English shiritori==
A version of Shiritori using only English words was invented to help people learn English. Most rules are the same, yet there are several original and optional rules that are used.

*For students of English, any words - including nouns, verbs, and adjectives - can be used.
*Players cannot use different tenses of previously used verbs unless they have nonstandard conjugation. For example, a player may use &quot;be&quot;, &quot;was&quot;, and &quot;is&quot;, but not both &quot;kick&quot; and &quot;kicked&quot;.
*When a word ends in a silent vowel, like &quot;life&quot;, one may either use the vowel in another word or use the preceding consonant instead.

==Similar games==

* In English, the closest game is word chain.
* Similar Russian word games include &quot;A Game of Words&quot; (), where players are required to say a noun that begins with the final letter of the previous word, and &quot;A Game of Cities&quot; (), where players are required to say a name of a city or town that begins with the final letter of the previous word.
* In Chinese languages, a similar game is known as &quot;jielong&quot; (), where players start new words with the last hanzi of the preceding word. Another variant of the game is known as &quot;tzuchuan&quot; (字串), which utilises adding, removing or replacing of one of the character&#x27;s components to form another character. The most popular variant of the game is known as &quot;chengyu jielong&quot; (), which involves four character idioms instead.
* There is also a similar South Slavic game called Kalodont, in which players continue the chain by beginning with last two letters of the previous word.
* In Korean, a similar game is &quot;kkeunmaritgi&quot; (), in which players must say a word that starts with the last Hangul syllable of the previous word.
* In Romanian, there is a game called &quot;Fazan&quot; (&quot;Pheasant&quot;), in which players must say a word that starts with the last two letters of the previous word.

==Examples from popular culture==
* In the Japanese version of &quot;Tomodachi Life&quot;, there is an event called Shiritori Tournament, which was changed into Word chain in the European version and &quot;kkeunmaritgi&quot; in the Korean version; the North American version lacks the game, although there is a similar event called &quot;Rap Battle&quot;.
* In episode 6 of the anime &quot;Nichijou&quot;, the characters Yūko Aioi and Mio Naganohara play a picture version of the game.
* In episode 2 of the anime &quot;Miss Kobayashi&#x27;s Dragon Maid&quot;, the characters Miss Kobyashi, Tohru, and Kanna play the game (and lose by using the word &quot;dragon&quot;).
* In episode 6 of &quot;No Game No Life&quot;, Shiro and Sora face off against Jibril in materialization Shiritori, where objects appear or disappear when that object is named.
* In episode 3 of &quot;Non Non Biyori&quot;, the sisters Komari and Natsumi play Shiritori to pass time after running from home.
* In episode 2 of &quot;The Quintessential Quintuplets&quot;, Miku Nakano challenges Futaro Uesugi to a game of shiritori using names of Sengoku warlords.
* In episode 7 of &quot;Chronicles of the Going Home Club&quot;, Sakura challenges Natsuki to a game of shiritori using taboo cards on which words are written that cannot be said by either player.
* In episode 28 of &quot;Inazuma Eleven GO: Galaxy&quot;, four members of the Earth Eleven play the game together, with Maneuver forcibly ending the game early to avoid rousing suspicion over his strange answers.
* The Japanese ending theme of &quot;Pokémon Journeys&quot; is &quot;Pokémon Shiritori&quot;, which features the game being played with names of Pokémon.

<doc id="52015" wikidata="Q193223" url="?curid=52015" title="Proper motion">
<text>Proper motion is the astrometric measure of the observed changes in the apparent places of stars or other celestial objects in the sky, as seen from the center of mass of the Solar System, compared to the abstract background of the more distant stars.

The components for proper motion in the equatorial coordinate system (of a given epoch, often J2000.0) are given in the direction of right ascension (&quot;μ&quot;α) and of declination (&quot;μ&quot;δ). Their combined value is computed as the &quot;total proper motion&quot; (&quot;μ&quot;). It has dimensions of angle per time, typically arcseconds per year or milliarcseconds per year.

Knowledge of the proper motion, distance, and radial velocity allows calculations of an object&#x27;s motion from the Solar System&#x27;s frame of reference and its motion from the galactic frame of reference – that is motion in respect to the Sun, and by coordinate transformation, that in respect to the Milky Way.

== Introduction ==

Over the course of centuries, stars appear to maintain nearly fixed positions with respect to each other, so that they form the same constellations over historical time. As examples, both Ursa Major in the northern sky and Crux in the southern sky, look nearly the same now as they did hundreds of years ago. However, precise long-term observations show that such constellations change shape, albeit very slowly, and that each star has an independent motion.

This motion is caused by the movement of the stars relative to the Sun and Solar System. The Sun travels in a nearly circular orbit (the &quot;solar circle&quot;) about the center of the galaxy at a speed of about 220 km/s at a radius of from Sagittarius A* which can be taken as the rate of rotation of the Milky Way itself at this radius.

Any proper motion is a two-dimensional vector (as it excludes the component as to the direction of the line of sight) and it bears two quantities or characteristics: its position angle and its magnitude. The first is the direction of the proper motion on the celestial sphere (with 0 degrees meaning the motion is north, 90 degrees meaning the motion is east, (left on most sky maps and space telescope images) and so on), and the second is its magnitude, typically expressed in arcseconds per year (symbols: arcsec/yr, as/yr, ″/yr, ″ yr−1) or milliarcseconds per year (symbols: mas/yr, mas yr−1).

Proper motion may alternatively be defined by the angular changes per year in the star&#x27;s right ascension (&quot;μα&quot;) and declination (&quot;μδ&quot;) with respect to a constant epoch.

The components of proper motion by convention are arrived at as follows. Suppose an object moves from coordinates (α1, δ1) to coordinates (α2, δ2) in a time Δ&quot;t&quot;. The proper motions are given by:
:formula_1
:formula_2
The magnitude of the proper motion &quot;μ&quot; is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
:formula_3
:&quot;technically abbreviated:&quot;
:formula_4
where &quot;δ&quot; is the declination. The factor in cos2&quot;δ&quot; accounts for the widening of the lines (hours) of right ascension away from the poles, cos&quot;δ&quot;, being zero for a hypothetical object fixed at a celestial pole in declination. Thus, a co-efficient is given to negate the misleadingly greater east or west velocity (angular change in &quot;α&quot;) in hours of Right Ascension the further it is towards the imaginary infinite poles, above and below the earth&#x27;s axis of rotation, in the sky. The change &quot;μ&quot;α, which must be multiplied by cos&quot;δ&quot; to become a component of the proper motion, is sometimes called the &quot;proper motion in right ascension&quot;, and &quot;μ&quot;δ the &quot;proper motion in declination&quot;.

If the proper motion in right ascension has been converted by cos&quot;δ&quot;, the result is designated &quot;μ&quot;α*. For example, the proper motion results in right ascension in the Hipparcos Catalogue (HIP) have already been converted. Hence, the individual proper motions in right ascension and declination are made equivalent for straightforward calculations of various other stellar motions.

The position angle &quot;θ&quot; is related to these components by:

:formula_5
:formula_6

Motions in equatorial coordinates can be converted to motions in galactic coordinates.

== Examples ==

For most stars seen in the sky, the observed proper motions are small and unremarkable. Such stars are often either faint or are significantly distant, have changes of below 0.01″ per year, and do not appear to move appreciably over many millennia. A few do have significant motions, and are usually called &quot;high-proper motion stars.&quot; Motions can also be in almost seemingly random directions. Two or more stars, double stars or open star clusters, which are moving in similar directions, exhibit so-called shared or &quot;common proper motion&quot; (or cpm.), suggesting they may be gravitationally attached or share similar motion in space.

Barnard&#x27;s Star has the largest proper motion of all stars, moving at 10.3″ yr−1. Large proper motion usually strongly indicates an object is close to the Sun. This is so for Barnard&#x27;s Star, about 6 light-years away. After the Sun and the Alpha Centauri system, it is the nearest known star. Being a red dwarf with an apparent magnitude of 9.54, it is too faint to see without a telescope or powerful binoculars. Of the stars visible to the naked eye (conservatively limiting unaided visual magnitude to 6.0), 61 Cygni A (magnitude V=5.20) has the highest proper motion at 5.281″ yr−1, discounting Groombridge 1830 (magnitude V=6.42), proper motion: 7.058″ yr−1.

A proper motion of 1 arcsec per year 1 light-year away corresponds to a relative transverse speed of 1.45 km/s. Barnard&#x27;s Star&#x27;s transverse speed is 90 km/s and its radial velocity is 111 km/s (perpendicular (at a right, 90° angle), which gives a true or &quot;space&quot; motion of 142 km/s. True or absolute motion is more difficult to measure than the proper motion, because the true transverse velocity involves the product of the proper motion times the distance. As shown by this formula, true velocity measurements depend on distance measurements, which are difficult in general.

In 1992 Rho Aquilae became the first star to have its Bayer designation invalidated by moving to a neighbouring constellation – it is now in Delphinus.

== Usefulness in astronomy ==

Stars with large proper motions tend to be nearby; most stars are far enough away that their proper motions are very small, on the order of a few thousandths of an arcsecond per year. It is possible to construct nearly complete samples of high proper motion stars by comparing photographic sky survey images taken many years apart. The Palomar Sky Survey is one source of such images. In the past, searches for high proper motion objects were undertaken using blink comparators to examine the images by eye. More modern techniques such as image differencing can scan digitized images, or comparisons to star catalogs obtained by satellites. As any selection biases of these surveys are well understood and quantifiable, studies have confirmed more and inferred approximate quantities of unseen stars – revealing and confirming more by studying them further, regardless of brightness, for instance. Studies of this kind show most of the nearest stars are intrinsically faint and angularly small, such as red dwarfs.

Measurement of the proper motions of a large sample of stars in a distant stellar system, like a globular cluster, can be used to compute the cluster&#x27;s total mass via the Leonard-Merritt mass estimator. Coupled with measurements of the stars&#x27; radial velocities, proper motions can be used to compute the distance to the cluster.

Stellar proper motions have been used to infer the presence of a super-massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. This now confirmed to exist black hole is called Sgr A*, and has a mass of 4.3 × (solar masses).

Proper motions of the galaxies in the Local Group are discussed in detail in Röser. In 2005, the first measurement was made of the proper motion of the Triangulum Galaxy M33, the third largest and only ordinary spiral galaxy in the Local Group, located 0.860 ± 0.028 Mpc beyond the Milky Way. The motion of the Andromeda Galaxy was measured in 2012, and an Andromeda–Milky Way collision is predicted in about 4.5 billion years. Proper motion of the NGC 4258 (M106) galaxy in the M106 group of galaxies was used in 1999 to find an accurate distance to this object. Measurements were made of the radial motion of objects in that galaxy moving directly toward and away from Earth, and assuming this same motion to apply to objects with only a proper motion, the observed proper motion predicts a distance to the galaxy of .

== History ==

Proper motion was suspected by early astronomers (according to Macrobius, &quot;c.&quot; AD 400) but a proof was not provided until 1718 by Edmund Halley, who noticed that Sirius, Arcturus and Aldebaran were over half a degree away from the positions charted by the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus roughly 1850 years earlier.

The lesser meaning of &quot;proper&quot; used is arguably dated English (but neither historic, nor obsolete when used as a postpositive, as in &quot;the city proper&quot;) meaning &quot;belonging to&quot; or &quot;own&quot;. &quot;Improper motion&quot; would refer to perceived motion that is nothing to do with an object&#x27;s inherent course, such as due to Earth&#x27;s axial precession, and minor deviations, nutations well within the 26,000-year cycle.

<text>William Thomas Tutte (; 14 May 1917 – 2 May 2002) was an English and Canadian code breaker and mathematician. During the Second World War, he made a brilliant and fundamental advance in cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, a major Nazi German cipher system which was used for top-secret communications within the Wehrmacht High Command. The high-level, strategic nature of the intelligence obtained from Tutte&#x27;s crucial breakthrough, in the bulk decrypting of Lorenz-enciphered messages specifically, contributed greatly, and perhaps even decisively, to the defeat of Nazi Germany. He also had a number of significant mathematical accomplishments, including foundation work in the fields of graph theory and matroid theory.

Tutte&#x27;s research in the field of graph theory proved to be of remarkable importance. At a time when graph theory was still a primitive subject, Tutte commenced the study of matroids and developed them into a theory by expanding from the work that Hassler Whitney had first developed around the mid-1930s. Even though Tutte&#x27;s contributions to graph theory have been influential to modern graph theory and many of his theorems have been used to keep making advances in the field, most of his terminology was not in agreement with their conventional usage and thus his terminology is not used by graph theorists today. &quot;Tutte advanced graph theory from a subject with one text (D. Kőnig&#x27;s) toward its present extremely active state.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Tutte was born in Newmarket in Suffolk. He was the younger son of William John Tutte (1873–1944), an estate gardener, and Annie (&quot;née&quot; Newell; 1881–1956), a housekeeper. Both parents worked at Fitzroy House stables where Tutte was born. The family spent some time in Buckinghamshire, County Durham and Yorkshire before returning to Newmarket, where Tutte attended Cheveley Church of England primary school in the nearby village of Cheveley. In 1927, when he was ten, Tutte won a scholarship to the Cambridge and County High School for Boys. He took up his place there in 1928.

In 1935 he won a scholarship to study natural sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he specialized in chemistry and graduated with first-class honours in 1938. He continued with physical chemistry as a graduate student, but transferred to mathematics at the end of 1940. As a student, he (along with three of his friends) became one of the first to solve the problem of squaring the square, and the first to solve the problem without a squared subrectangle. Together the four created the pseudonym Blanche Descartes, under which Tutte published occasionally for years.

==Second World War==

Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War, Tutte&#x27;s tutor, Patrick Duff, suggested him for war work at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (BP). He was interviewed and sent on a training course in London before going to Bletchley Park, where he joined the Research Section. At first, he worked on the Hagelin cipher that was being used by the Italian Navy. This was a rotor cipher machine that was available commercially, so the mechanics of enciphering was known, and decrypting messages only required working out how the machine was set up.

In the summer of 1941, Tutte was transferred to work on a project called Fish. Intelligence information had revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems &quot;Sägefisch&quot; (&#x27;sawfish&#x27;). This led the British to use the code Fish for the German teleprinter cipher system. The nickname Tunny (tunafish) was used for the first non-Morse link, and it was subsequently used for the Lorenz SZ machines and the traffic that they enciphered.

Telegraphy used the 5-bit International Telegraphy Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2). Nothing was known about the mechanism of enciphering other than that messages were preceded by a 12-letter indicator, which implied a 12-wheel rotor cipher machine. The first step, therefore, had to be to diagnose the machine by establishing the logical structure and hence the functioning of the machine. Tutte played a pivotal role in achieving this, and it was not until shortly before the Allied victory in Europe in 1945, that Bletchley Park acquired a Tunny Lorenz cipher machine. Tutte&#x27;s breakthroughs led eventually to bulk decrypting of Tunny-enciphered messages between the German High Command (OKW) in Berlin and their army commands throughout occupied Europe and contributed—perhaps decisively—to the defeat of Germany.

===Diagnosing the cipher machine===
On 31 August 1941, two versions of the same message were sent using identical keys, which constituted a &quot;depth&quot;. This allowed John Tiltman, Bletchley Park&#x27;s veteran and remarkably gifted cryptanalyst, to deduce that it was a Vernam cipher which uses the Exclusive Or (XOR) function (symbolised by &quot;⊕&quot;), and to extract the two messages and hence obtain the obscuring key. After a fruitless period during which Research Section cryptanalysts tried to work out how the Tunny machine worked, this and some other keys were handed to Tutte, who was asked to &quot;see what you can make of these&quot;.

At his training course, Tutte had been taught the Kasiski examination technique of writing out a key on squared paper, starting a new row after a defined number of characters that was suspected of being the frequency of repetition of the key. If this number was correct, the columns of the matrix would show more repetitions of sequences of characters than chance alone. Tutte knew that the Tunny indicators used 25 letters (excluding J) for 11 of the positions, but only 23 letters for the other. He therefore tried Kasiski&#x27;s technique on the first impulse of the key characters, using a repetition of 25 × 23 = 575. He did not observe a large number of column repetitions with this period, but he did observe the phenomenon on a diagonal. He therefore tried again with 574, which showed up repeats in the columns. Recognising that the prime factors of this number are 2, 7 and 41, he tried again with a period of 41 and &quot;got a rectangle of dots and crosses that was replete with repetitions&quot;.

It was clear, however, that the first impulse of the key was more complicated than that produced by a single wheel of 41 key impulses. Tutte called this component of the key formula_1 (&quot;chi&quot;1). He figured that there was another component, which was XOR-ed with this, that did not always change with each new character, and that this was the product of a wheel that he called formula_2 (&quot;psi&quot;1). The same applied for each of the five impulses So for a single character, the whole key K consisted of two components:
formula_3

At Bletchley Park, mark impulses were signified by x and space impulses by •. For example, the letter &quot;H&quot; would be coded as ••x•x. Tutte&#x27;s derivation of the &quot;chi&quot; and &quot;psi&quot; components was made possible by the fact that dots were more likely than not to be followed by dots, and crosses more likely than not to be followed by crosses. This was a product of a weakness in the German key setting, which they later eliminated. Once Tutte had made this breakthrough, the rest of the Research Section joined in to study the other impulses, and it was established that the five &quot;chi&quot; wheels all advanced with each new character and that the five &quot;psi&quot; wheels all moved together under the control of two &quot;mu&quot; or &quot;motor&quot; wheels. Over the following two months, Tutte and other members of the Research Section worked out the complete logical structure of the machine, with its set of wheels bearing cams that could either be in a position (raised) that added x to the stream of key characters, or in the alternative position that added in •.

Diagnosing the functioning of the Tunny machine in this way was a truly remarkable cryptanalytical achievement which, in the citation for Tutte&#x27;s induction as an Officer of the Order of Canada, was described as &quot;one of the greatest intellectual feats of World War II&quot;.

===Tutte&#x27;s statistical method===

To decrypt a Tunny message required knowledge not only of the logical functioning of the machine, but also the start positions of each rotor for the particular message. The search was on for a process that would manipulate the ciphertext or key to produce a frequency distribution of characters that departed from the uniformity that the enciphering process aimed to achieve. While on secondment to the Research Section in July 1942, Alan Turing worked out that the XOR combination of the values of successive characters in a stream of ciphertext and key emphasised any departures from a uniform distribution. The resultant stream (symbolised by the Greek letter &quot;delta&quot; Δ) was called the difference because XOR is the same as modulo 2 subtraction.

The reason that this provided a way into Tunny was that although the frequency distribution of characters in the ciphertext could not be distinguished from a random stream, the same was not true for a version of the ciphertext from which the &quot;chi&quot; element of the key had been removed. This was the case because where the plaintext contained a repeated character and the &quot;psi&quot; wheels did not move on, the differenced &quot;psi&quot; character (formula_4) would be the null character (&#x27;/ &#x27; at Bletchley Park). When XOR-ed with any character, this character has no effect. Repeated characters in the plaintext were more frequent both because of the characteristics of German (EE, TT, LL and SS are relatively common), and because telegraphists frequently repeated the figure-shift and letter-shift characters.

To quote the General Report on Tunny:Turingery introduced the principle that the key differenced at one, now called ΔΚ, could yield information unobtainable from ordinary key. This Δ principle was to be the fundamental basis of nearly all statistical methods of wheel-breaking and setting.

Tutte exploited this amplification of non-uniformity in the differenced values and by November 1942 had produced a way of discovering wheel starting points of the Tunny machine which became known as the &quot;Statistical Method&quot;. The essence of this method was to find the initial settings of the &quot;chi&quot; component of the key by exhaustively trying all positions of its combination with the ciphertext, and looking for evidence of the non-uniformity that reflected the characteristics of the original plaintext. Because any repeated characters in the plaintext would always generate •, and similarly formula_5 would generate • whenever the &quot;psi&quot; wheels did not move on, and about half of the time when they did – some 70% overall.

As well as applying differencing to the full 5-bit characters of the ITA2 code, Tutte applied it to the individual impulses (bits). The current &quot;chi&quot; wheel cam settings needed to have been established to allow the relevant sequence of characters of the &quot;chi&quot; wheels to be generated. It was totally impracticable to generate the 22 million characters from all five of the &quot;chi&quot; wheels, so it was initially limited to 41 × 31 = 1271 from the first two. After explaining his findings to Max Newman, Newman was given the job of developing an automated approach to comparing ciphertext and key to look for departures from randomness. The first machine was dubbed Heath Robinson, but the much faster Colossus computer, developed by Tommy Flowers and using algorithms written by Tutte and his colleagues, soon took over for breaking codes.

==Doctorate and career==
In late 1945, Tutte resumed his studies at Cambridge, now as a graduate student in mathematics. He published some work begun earlier, one a now famous paper that characterises which graphs have a perfect matching, and another that constructs a non-Hamiltonian graph.

Tutte completed a doctorate in mathematics from Cambridge in 1948 under the supervision of Shaun Wylie, who had also worked at Bletchley Park on Tunny. His thesis &quot;An Algebraic Theory of Graphs&quot; was considered ground breaking and was about the subject later known as matroid theory.

The same year, invited by Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter, he accepted a position at the University of Toronto. In 1962, he moved to the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, where he stayed for the rest of his academic career. He officially retired in 1985, but remained active as an emeritus professor. Tutte was instrumental in helping to found the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo.

His mathematical career concentrated on combinatorics, especially graph theory, which he is credited as having helped create in its modern form, and matroid theory, to which he made profound contributions; one colleague described him as &quot;the leading mathematician in combinatorics for three decades&quot;. He was editor in chief of the &quot;Journal of Combinatorial Theory&quot; until retiring from Waterloo in 1985. He also served on the editorial boards of several other mathematical research journals.

==Research contributions==
Tutte&#x27;s work in graph theory includes the structure of cycle spaces and cut spaces, the size of maximum matchings and existence of &quot;k&quot;-factors in graphs, and Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian graphs. He disproved Tait&#x27;s conjecture, on the Hamiltonicity of polyhedral graphs, by using the construction known as Tutte&#x27;s fragment. The eventual proof of the four colour theorem made use of his earlier work. The graph polynomial he called the &quot;dichromate&quot; has become famous and influential under the name of the Tutte polynomial and serves as the prototype of combinatorial invariants that are universal for all invariants that satisfy a specified reduction law.

The first major advances in matroid theory were made by Tutte in his 1948 Cambridge PhD thesis which formed the basis of an important sequence of papers published over the next two decades. Tutte&#x27;s work in graph theory and matroid theory has been profoundly influential on the development of both the content and direction of these two fields. In matroid theory, he discovered the highly sophisticated homotopy theorem and founded the studies of chain groups and regular matroids, about which he proved deep results.

In addition, Tutte developed an algorithm for determining whether a given binary matroid is a graphic matroid. The algorithm makes use of the fact that a planar graph is simply a graph whose circuit-matroid, the dual of its bond-matroid, is graphic.

Tutte wrote a paper entitled &quot;How to Draw a Graph&quot; in which he proved that any face in a 3-connected graph is enclosed by a peripheral cycle. Using this fact, Tutte developed an alternative proof to show that every Kuratowski graph is non-planar by showing that &quot;K&quot;5 and &quot;K&quot;3,3 each have three distinct peripheral cycles with a common edge. In addition to using peripheral cycles to prove that the Kuratowski graphs are non-planar, Tutte proved that every simple 3-connected graph can be drawn with all its faces convex, and devised an algorithm which constructs the plane drawing by solving a linear system. The resulting drawing is known as the Tutte embedding.
Tutte&#x27;s algorithm makes use of the barycentric mappings of the peripheral circuits of a simple 3-connected graph.

The findings published in this paper have proved to be of much significance because the algorithms that Tutte developed have become popular planar graph drawing methods.
One of the reasons for which Tutte&#x27;s embedding is popular is that the necessary computations that are carried out by his algorithms are simple and guarantee a one-to-one correspondence of a graph and its embedding onto the Euclidean plane, which is of importance when parameterising a three-dimensional mesh to the plane in geometric modelling. &quot;Tutte&#x27;s theorem is the basis for solutions to other computer graphics problems, such as morphing.&quot;

Tutte was mainly responsible for developing the theory of enumeration of planar graphs, which has close links with chromatic and dichromatic polynomials. This work involved some highly innovative techniques of his own invention, requiring considerable manipulative dexterity in handling power series (whose coefficients count appropriate kinds of graphs) and the functions arising as their sums, as well as geometrical dexterity in extracting these power series from the graph-theoretic situation.

Tutte summarised his work in the &quot;Selected Papers of W.T. Tutte&quot;, 1979, and in &quot;Graph Theory as I have known it&quot;, 1998.

Because of Tutte&#x27;s work at Bletchley Park, Canada&#x27;s Communications Security Establishment named an internal organisation aimed at promoting research into cryptology, the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing (TIMC), in his honour in 2011.

In September 2014, Tutte was celebrated in his hometown of Newmarket, England, with the unveiling of a sculpture, after a local newspaper started a campaign to honour his memory.

Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes celebrated Tutte&#x27;s work with an exhibition &quot;Bill Tutte: Mathematician + Codebreaker&quot; from May 2017 to 2019, preceded on 14 May 2017 by lectures about his life and work during the Bill Tutte Centenary Symposium.

==Personal life and death==
In addition to the career benefits of working at the new University of Waterloo, the more rural setting of Waterloo County appealed to Bill and his wife Dorothea. They bought a house in the nearby village of West Montrose, Ontario where they enjoyed hiking, spending time in their garden on the Grand River and allowing others to enjoy the beautiful scenery of their property.

They also had an extensive knowledge of all the birds in their garden. Dorothea, an avid potter, was also a keen hiker and Bill organised hiking trips. Even near the end of his life Bill still was an avid walker. After his wife died in 1994, he moved back to Newmarket (Suffolk), but then returned to Waterloo in 2000, where he died two years later. He is buried in West Montrose United Cemetery.

<doc id="52023" wikidata="Q213001" url="?curid=52023" title="Farouk of Egypt">
<text>Farouk I (; &quot;Fārūq al-Awwal&quot;; 11 February 1920 – 18 March 1965) was the tenth ruler of Egypt from the Muhammad Ali dynasty and the penultimate King of Egypt and the Sudan, succeeding his father, Fuad I, in 1936 and reigning until his overthrow in a military coup in 1952.

His full title was &quot;His Majesty Farouk I, by the grace of God, King of Egypt and the Sudan&quot;. As king, Farouk was known for his extravagant playboy lifestyle. While initially popular, his reputation eroded due to the corruption and incompetence of his government. He was overthrown in the 1952 coup d&#x27;état and forced to abdicate in favour of his infant son, Ahmed Fuad, who succeeded him as Fuad II. Farouk died in exile in Italy in 1965.

His sister, Princess Fawzia bint Fuad, was the first wife and consort of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

==Early life and education==

He was born as &quot;His Sultanic Highness&quot; Farouk bin Fuad, Hereditary Prince of Egypt and Sudan, on 11 February 1920 (Jumada al-Awwal 21, 1338 A.H.) at Abdeen Palace, Cairo, the eldest child of Sultan Fuad I (later King Fuad I) and his second wife, Nazli Sabri. He had Albanian, Circassian, Turkish, French, Greek and Egyptian ancestry. Farouk&#x27;s first languages were Egyptian Arabic, Turkish and French (the languages of the Egyptian elite), and he always thought of himself as an Egyptian rather than as an Arab, having no interest in Arab nationalism except as a way of increasing Egypt&#x27;s power in the Middle East. Egypt at that time was quite rich, but its wealth was very maldistributed. The pashas, representing less than .5% of all landowners, owned a third of all cultivated land in the country.

In addition to his sisters, Fawzia, Faiza, Faika and Fathia, he had one half-sister from his father&#x27;s previous marriage to Princess Shivakiar Khanum Effendi, Princess Fawkia. Fuad gave all of his children names starting with F after an Indian fortune-teller told him names starting with F would bring him good luck. King Fuad kept tight control over his only son when he was growing up and Farouk was only allowed to see his mother once every day for an hour. The prince grew up in the very closeted world of the royal palaces, and he never visited the Great Pyramids at Giza until he became king, despite the fact that only separated the Abdeen Palace from the Pyramids. Farouk had a very spoiled upbringing with the Sudanese servants when meeting him always getting down on their knees to first kiss the ground and then his hand. Aside from his sisters, Farouk had no friends when growing up as Fuad would not allow any outsiders to meet him. 

Fuad, who did not speak Arabic, insisted that the crown prince learn Arabic so he could talk to his subjects. Farouk became fluent in classical Arabic, the language of the Quran, and he always gave his speeches in classical Arabic. As a child, Farouk showed a facility for languages, learning Arabic, English, French and Italian, which were the only subjects he excelled in. The more honest of Farouk&#x27;s tutors often wrote comments on his childhood essays such as &quot;Improve your bad handwriting and pay attention to the cleanliness of your notebook&quot; and &quot;It is regrettable that you do not know the history of your ancestors&quot;. The more sycophantic of his tutors wrote comments like &quot;Excellent. A brilliant future awaits you in the world of literature&quot; on an essay that began with the sentence &quot;My father had a lot of ministers and I have a cat&quot;. Farouk was known for his love of practical jokes, a trait that continued as an adult. For instance, he liked to free the quail that the game keepers had captured on the grounds of the Montaza Palace, and he once used an air gun to shoot out the windows at the Koubbeh Palace. When Queen Marie of Romania visited the Koubbeh Palace to see Queen Nazli, Farouk asked her if she wanted to see his two horses; when she answered in the positive, Farouk had the horses brought into the royal harem, which greatly displeased the two queens as the animals defecated all over the floor. Farouk&#x27;s Swedish au pair, Gerda Sjöberg, wrote in her diary: &quot;The truth doesn&#x27;t exist in Egypt. Breaking promises is normal. Farouk is already perfect at this. He loves to lie. But it&#x27;s amazing Farouk is as good as he, given his mother.&quot; Knowing of his family&#x27;s genetic predisposition to obesity, King Fuad kept Farouk on a strict diet, warning him that the male descendants of Muhammad Ali the Great tended to get obese very easily.

Farouk&#x27;s closest friend when growing up and later as an adult was the Italian electrician at the Abdeen Palace, Antonio Pulli, who became one of Egypt&#x27;s most powerful men during his reign. An attempt to enroll Farouk at Eton was thwarted when he failed the entrance exams. Before his father&#x27;s death, he was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, England. The Italophile Fuad wanted to have Farouk educated at the Turin Military Academy, but the British High Commissioner Sir Miles Lampson vetoed this choice as growing Italian claims for the entire Mediterranean to be &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; (&quot;Our Sea&quot;) made it unacceptable for the Crown Prince to be educated in Italy.

In October 1935, Farouk left Egypt to settle at Kenry House in the countryside of Surrey to attend the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich as an extramural student. Farouk attended classes occasionally at &quot;the Shop&quot;, as the academy was known, to prepare himself for the entrance exam. Farouk stayed at Kenry House and twice a week was driven in a Rolls-Royce to the Royal Military Academy to attend classes, but still failed the entrance exam. One of Farouk&#x27;s tutors, General Aziz Ali al-Misri, complained to King Fuad that the principal problem with Farouk as a student was he never studied and expected the answers to be given to him when he wrote his exam. Instead of studying, Farouk spent his time in London where he went shopping, attended football matches with the Prince of Wales, and visited restaurants and brothels. Farouk&#x27;s other tutor, the famous desert explorer, Olympic athlete and poet Ahmed Hassanein reported to King Fuad that Farouk was studying hard, but the inability of the crown prince to pass entrance exams supports General al-Misri&#x27;s reports. When King George V died in January 1936, Farouk represented Egypt at his funeral in Westminster Abbey.

On 28 April 1936, King Fuad died of a heart attack and Farouk left England to return to Egypt as king. Farouk&#x27;s first act as king was to visit Buckingham Palace to accept the condolences of King Edward VIII, one of the few Englishmen whom Farouk liked, and then he went to Victoria Station to take a train to Dover and was seen off by the Foreign Secretary, Sir Anthony Eden. At Dover, Farouk boarded a French ship, the &quot;Côte d&#x27;Azur&quot;, which took him to Calais. After a stop in Paris to shop and visit the Elysee Palace, Farouk took the train to Marseilles, where he boarded an ocean liner, the &quot;Viceroy of India&quot; to take him to Alexandria, where he landed on 6 May 1936. Upon landing in Alexandria, Farouk was greeted by huge crowds who shouted &quot;Long live the king of the Nile!&quot; and &quot;Long live the king of Egypt and the Sudan!&quot; In 1936, Farouk was known by his subjects as &quot;al malik al mahbub&quot; (&quot;the beloved king&quot;). Besides inheriting the throne, Farouk also received all of the land that his father had acquired, which amounted to one seventh of all the arable land in Egypt. As the Nile river valley has some of the most fertile and productive farmland in the entire world, this was a considerable asset. Fuad left Farouk a fortune worth about US$100 million (a sum worth US$1,862,130,434 in 2020 dollars when adjusted for inflation) plus of land in the Nile river valley, five palaces, 200 cars and 2 yachts. Farouk&#x27;s biographer, William Stadiem, wrote:no pharaoh, no Mameluke, no khedive ever began a reign with such unquestionable, enthusiastic goodwill as King Farouk. And none was as unprepared to rule. Here was a completely sheltered, virtually uneducated sixteen-year old, expected to fill the spats of his wily, politically astute father in a loaded tug-of-war between nationalism, imperialism, constitutionalism, and monarchy.
==Ascension==

Upon his coronation, the 16-year-old King Farouk made a public radio address to the nation, the first time a sovereign of Egypt had ever spoken directly to his people in such a way:

As Farouk was extremely popular with the Egyptian people, it was decided by the Prime Minister, Aly Maher, that Farouk should not return to Britain as that would be unpopular, though one of the regents, Prince Muhammad Ali, had wanted Farouk to keep trying to be admitted on a full-time basis to the Royal Military Academy as a means of getting him out of the country. Since under Egyptian law women could not inherit the throne, Farouk&#x27;s cousin Prince Muhammad Ali was next in line to the throne. Prince Muhammad Ali was to spend the next 16 years scheming to depose Farouk so he could become king. Egypt was in the process of negotiating a treaty that would reduce some of the British privileges in Egypt and make the country more independent in exchange for keeping Egypt in the British sphere of influence. The ambitions of Benito Mussolini to dominate the Mediterranean led the Wafd—traditionally the anti-British party—to want to keep the British presence in Egypt, at least as long as Mussolini kept calling the Mediterranean &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot;. For both the Wafd and the British, it was convenient to keep Farouk in Egypt so that when he signed the new Anglo-Egyptian treaty, it would not be seen as under duress as it would be if Farouk was living in Britain. Sir Miles Lampson believed he together with assorted other British officials like the king&#x27;s tutor, Edward Ford, could mould Farouk into an Anglophile. Lampson&#x27;s plans were derailed when it emerged that Farouk was more interested in duck-hunting than Ford&#x27;s lectures and that the king had &quot;bragged&quot; he would &quot;have the hell&quot; with the British, saying they had humiliated him for long enough.

The fact that Farouk had dismissed all of the British servants employed by his father, while keeping the Italian servants, suggested he had inherited Fuad&#x27;s Italophilia. Farouk especially resented Lampson&#x27;s attempts to set himself up as a surrogate father, finding him impossibly patronising and rude, complaining that at one moment Lampson would address him as a king and the next moment would call him to his face a &quot;naughty boy&quot;. Lampson was 55 when Farouk acceded to the throne and he never learned how to treat the teenage Farouk as an equal. The official was charmed by Egypt, which he regarded as a wondrous exotic land, but as his Arabic was not particularly good, his contacts with ordinary Egyptians were only on a superficial level. Lampson was fluent in French and his social contracts were almost entirely with the Egyptian elite. Lampson wrote in his diary about the death of King Fuad: &quot;Slippery customer though he was, he was an immense factor in the situation here and... we could always in the last resort get him to act in any particular line that we wished&quot;. About Farouk, Lampson wrote he did not expect to have &quot;a young immature King on our hands. I frankly don&#x27;t know quite how that problem is going to be handled&quot;.

Farouk was enamored of the glamorous royal lifestyle. Although he already had thousands of acres of land, dozens of palaces and hundreds of cars, the youthful king often traveled to Europe for grand shopping sprees, earning the ire of many of his subjects. It is said that he ate 600 oysters a week. His personal vehicle was a red 1947 Bentley Mark VI, with coachwork by Figoni et Falaschi; he dictated that, other than the military jeeps which made up the rest of his entourage, no other cars were to be painted red. In 1951, he bought the pear-shaped 94-carat Star of the East diamond and a fancy-coloured oval-cut diamond from jeweller Harry Winston.

He was most popular in his early years, and the nobility largely celebrated him. For example, during the accession of the young King Farouk, &quot;the Abaza family had solicited palace authorities to permit the royal train to stop briefly in their village so that the king could partake of refreshments offered in a large, magnificently ornamented tent the family had erected in the train station.&quot; The Chief Accountant to Farouk was Yadidya Israel, who was secretly working with the Free Officers movement that removed the King in 1952, as was the Abaza family&#x27;s own Wagih Abaza, who later became governor of six governorates in post-Farouk Egypt.

Farouk&#x27;s accession initially was encouraging for the populace and nobility, due to his youth and Egyptian roots through his mother Nazli Sabri. Standing 6&#x27;0 tall and extremely handsome in his teenage years, Farouk was viewed as a sex symbol in his early years, making the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine as a leader to watch while &quot;Life&quot; magazine in article on him called the Abdeen Palace &quot;possibly the most magnificent royal place in the world&quot; and Farouk &quot;the very model of a young Muslim gentleman&quot;. However, the situation was not the same with some Egyptian politicians and elected government officials, with whom Farouk quarreled frequently, despite their loyalty in principle to his throne. There was also the issue of the British influence in the Egyptian government, which Farouk viewed with disdain. Farouk&#x27;s accession had changed the dynamic of Egyptian politics from being a struggle of an unpopular king vs. the popular Wafd party as it was under his father to that of a popular Wafd vs. an even more popular king. The Wafd Party, led by Nahas Pasha, had been the most popular party in Egypt since it had been founded in 1919, and the Wafd leaders felt threatened by Farouk&#x27;s popularity with ordinary Egyptians. Right from the start of Farouk&#x27;s reign, the Wafd—who claimed to speak alone for Egypt&#x27;s masses—saw Farouk as a threat and Nahas Pasha worked constantly to clip the king&#x27;s power, confirming the prejudices that Farouk had inherited from his father against the Wafd. When Nahas and the other Wafd leaders traveled to London to sign the Anglo-Egyptian treaty in August 1936, they stopped over in Switzerland to hold discussions with former Khedive Abbas II about how best to depose Farouk and put Abbas back on the throne. 

The dominant figure in the Wafd was Makram Ebeid, the man widely considered to be the most intelligent Egyptian politician of the interwar era. Ebeid was a Coptic Christian, which made it unacceptable for him to be prime minister of Muslim majority Egypt, and so he exercised power via his protege Nahas, who was the official party leader. Leaders in the Wafd like Ali Maher, opposed to Ebeid and Nahas, looked to Farouk as a rival source of patronage and power. Both Ebeid and Nahas disliked Maher, regarding him as an intriguer and an opportunist, and found a further reason to dislike him even more when Maher became Farouk&#x27;s favorite political adviser. The nationalistic Wafd Party was the most powerful political machine in Egypt, and when the Wafd was in power, it tended to be very corrupt and nepotistic. Those excluded from opportunities for corruption, like Maher Pasha, made much of the corruption, in particular the baleful influence of Nahas Pasha&#x27;s dominating wife (who insisted on giving high government jobs to members of her family, no matter how unqualified they were). Though the Wafd Party had been founded in 1919 as the anti-British party, the fact that Nahas Pasha championed the 1936 treaty as the best way of keeping Mussolini from conquering Egypt as he had done Ethiopia, paradoxically led Lampson to favor Nahas and the Wafd as the most pro-British party, in turn leading opponents of the Wafd to attack them for &quot;selling out&quot; by signing a treaty which allowed the British to keep their garrisons in Egypt. As Farouk could not stand the overbearing Lampson, and saw the Wafd as his enemies, the king naturally aligned himself with the anti-Wafd factions and those who saw the treaty as a &quot;sell out&quot;. Lampson personally favored deposing Farouk and putting his cousin Prince Muhammad Ali on the throne in order to keep the Wafd in power, but feared that a coup would destroy the popular legitimacy of Nahas.

Despite the regency council, Farouk was determined to exercise his royal prerogatives. When Farouk asked for a new railroad station to be built outside of the Montazah palace, the council refused under the grounds that station was only used twice a year by the royal family, when they arrived at the Montazah palace to escape the summer heat in Cairo and when they returned to Cairo in the fall. Unwilling to take no for an answer, Farouk called out his servants and led them to demolish the station, forcing the regency council to approve building a new station. To counterbalance the Wafd, Farouk from the time he arrived back in Egypt started to use Islam as a political weapon, always attending the Friday prayers at the local mosques, donating to Islamic charities, and courting the Muslim Brotherhood, the only group capable of rivaling the Wafd in terms of the ability to mobilize the masses. Farouk was known in his early years as the &quot;pious king&quot; as unlike his predecessors he went out of his way to be seen as a devout Muslim. The Egyptian historian Laila Morsy wrote that Nahas never really tried to reach an understanding with the Palace, and treated Farouk as an enemy from the start, seeing him as a threat to the Wafd. The Wafd ran a powerful patronage machine in rural Egypt and the enthusiastic response of the &quot;fellaheen&quot; to the king as he threw gold coins at them during his tours of the countryside was viewed by Nahas as a major threat. Nahas sought to prevent the king from &quot;parading&quot; himself before the masses, claiming that the king&#x27;s royal tours cost the government too much money, and as the Wafd was a secularist party, charged that Farouk&#x27;s overt religiosity violated the constitution. However, the attacks by the secularist Wafd on Farouk for being too pious a Muslim estranged conservative Muslim opinion who rallied in defense of the &quot;pious king&quot;. As the Coptic Christian minority tended to vote as a bloc for the Wafd and many prominent Wafd leaders like Ebeid were Copts, the Wafd was widely seen as the &quot;Coptic party&quot;. The aggressive defense by Nahas of secularism as a core principle of Egyptian life and his attacks against the king as a danger for being a devout Muslim led to a backlash and the charge that secularism was merely a device for allowing the Coptic Christian minority to dominate Egypt at the expense of the Muslim Arab majority.

Sir Edward Ford, who served as the king&#x27;s tutor, described him as a relaxed, gregarious and easy-going teenager whose first act upon meeting him in Alexandria was to take him swimming in the Mediterranean. However, Ford also described Farouk as incapable of learning and &quot;totally incapable of concentration&quot;. Whenever Ford began a lesson, Farouk would immediately find a way to end it by insisting that he take Ford out for a drive to see the Egyptian countryside. In an interview in 1990, Ford described Farouk as: &quot;He was half a private schoolboy of nine or ten and half a sophisticated young man of twenty-three, able to sit next to a great man like Lord Rutherford and impress him a great deal, usually by bluffing. He did have a very good eye, a royal eye. In England, he was able to spot the most valuable rare book in the Trinity College library in Cambridge. It may have been pure luck. But it impressed everyone. And he spoke wonderful English and Arabic&quot;. In turn, Farouk explained to Ford why upper-class Egyptian men were still using the titles left over from the Ottoman Empire such as pasha, bey and effendi, which Ford learned that a pasha was equivalent to being an aristocrat, a bey was equivalent to a title of knighthood and an effendi to being an esquire. Ford wrote in his notebook: &quot;A pasha may perhaps be defined as a person who looks important, a bey thinks himself important, an effendi hopes to be important&quot;. When Farouk went on his tour of Upper Egypt in January 1937, going down the Nile on the royal yacht &quot;Kassed el Kheir&quot;, Ford complained that Farouk never asked for a single lesson, as he was more interested in watching the latest films from Hollywood. Despite the fact that Upper Egypt was the poorest region in Egypt, various &quot;mudirs&quot; (governors) and sheikhs held camel races, gymnastic events, stick boxing matches, banquets and concerts in honor of the king, which led Ford to write of a &quot;record of unrivaled stardom, of which Greta Garbo might well be envious&quot;.

On 29 June 1937, Farouk turned 17 under the Islamic lunar calendar, and since in the Islamic world a baby is considered to be one year old at the time of birth, by Muslim standards he was celebrating his 18th birthday. As he was considered 18, he thus attained his majority, and the Regency Council, which had irked Farouk so much, was dissolved. Farouk&#x27;s coronation, held in Cairo, on 20 July 1937, outdid the coronation of George VI, which had just taken place that May, as Farouk held larger parades and fireworks displays than had taken place in London. For his coronation, Farouk reduced the fares on the Nile steamers and at least two million &quot;fellaheen&quot; (Egyptian peasants) took advantage of the price cut to attend his coronation in Cairo. Farouk&#x27;s coronation speech implicitly criticized the land-owning Turco-Circassian elite that he himself was a part of, as Farouk declared: &quot;The poor are not responsible for their poverty but rather the wealthy. Give to the poor what they merit without their asking. A king is a good king when the poor of the land have the right to live, when the sick have the right to be healed, when the timid have the right to be tranquil and when the ignorant have the right to learn&quot;. Farouk&#x27;s coronation speech, which was unexpectedly poetic, was written by his tutor, the poet Ahmed Hassanein, who felt that the king should present himself as the friend of the &quot;fellaheen&quot; to undercut the populist Wafd Party. Further cementing Farouk&#x27;s popularity was the announcement made on 24 August 1937, that he was engaged to Safinaz Zulficar, the daughter of an Alexandria judge. Farouk&#x27;s decision to marry a commoner instead of a member of the Turco-Circassian aristocracy increased his popularity with the Egyptian people.

The marriage of the king and a commoner was presented to the world as matter of romantic love, but in fact the marriage had been arranged by Queen Nazli, who herself was a commoner and did not want her son to marry a princess from the Turco-Circassian elite who would outrank her. Queen Nazli had chosen Zulficar as her daughter-in-law because she was 15 years old and thus presumably could be molded, and came from an upper-middle-class family like herself (Zulficar&#x27;s mother was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Nazli) and was fluent in French, the language of Egypt&#x27;s elite. Zulficar&#x27;s father refused to give permission for the marriage under the grounds that his daughter was 15 and too young to be married, and decided to take a vacation in Beirut. Unwilling to take no for an answer, Farouk phoned the police chief of Alexandria, who arrested Judge Zulficar as he was boarding the ship for Beirut, and the judge was taken to the Montaza Palace. At the Montaza palace, Farouk was waiting and bribed Judge Zulficar into granting permission for the marriage by making him into a pasha. At Salfinaz Zulficar&#x27;s 16th birthday party, Farouk arrived in his Alfa Romeo automobile to propose marriage, and at the same time renamed her Farida because he believed names that started with F were lucky. (Safinaz is Persian for &quot;pure rose&quot; while Farida is Arabic for &quot;the only one&quot;; Farouk&#x27;s decision to give his bride an Arabic name appealed to the masses). Farouk gave Farida a cheque for a sum in Egyptian pounds equivalent to $50,000 US dollars as a wedding dowry and a diamond ring worth just as much for the engagement. Outside of the Ras El Tin Palace, when the wedding was announced, 22 people were crushed to death and 140 badly injured when the crowd rushed forward to hear the news.

In the fall of 1937, Farouk dismissed the Wafd government headed by Prime Minister Mostafa El-Nahas and replaced him as Prime Minister with Mohamed Mahmoud Pasha. The immediate issue were Nahas&#x27;s attempts to dismiss Farouk&#x27;s &quot;chef de cabinet&quot; Ali Maher together with Farouk&#x27;s Italian servants, but the more general issue was who would rule Egypt: the Crown or Parliament? As a number of ministers in the new government were pro-Italian at the same time that Mussolini was increasing the number of Italian troops in Libya, Farouk&#x27;s move was seen as pro-Italian and anti-British. Lampson delivered what he called a &quot;little lecture&quot; to Farouk, reporting to London: &quot;It will be fatal if the boy [Farouk] comes to think he is invincible and can play any trick he likes. Personally I have always liked him and he certainly has a most remarkable intelligence and courage—one begins to fear almost too much of the latter&quot;. At a meeting at the Abdeen Palace in December 1937, where Lampson declared that London was opposed to the Mahmoud government, Lampson reported: &quot;I found him rather baffling to deal with—in extraordinary good humour and apparently taking the whole thing rather flippantly whist at times relapsing into a very &#x27;kingly&#x27; attitude&quot;. Farouk told Lampson that he didn&#x27;t care if the Wafd had a majority in Parliament, as he was the king and he wanted a prime minister who would obey him, not Parliament. Lampson ended the meeting by saying &quot;Quos deus vult perdere prius dementat&quot; (&quot;Those God wishes to destroy, he first makes mad&quot;).

On 20 January 1938, Farouk married Farida in a sumptuous public event with Cairo lit up by floodlights and colored lights on the public buildings while boats on the Nile had likewise had colored lights, making the river seem a ribbon of light at night. Farida wore a wedding dress that Farouk had bought her, which was handmade in Paris and cost about $30,000 US dollars. The royal wedding made Farouk even more popular with the Egyptian people, and he dissolved parliament for elections in April 1938 with the full prestige and wealth of the Crown being used to support parties opposed to the Wafd. The prime minister, Nahas Pasha, used the familiar Wafd slogan &quot;The king reigns; he does not rule&quot;, but the Wafd suffered a massive defeat in the election. In 1938, Farouk was approached by the Iranian ambassador with a message from Reza Khan, the Shah of Iran, asking that his sister be married to Mohammad Reza, the Crown Prince of Iran. When a group of Iranian emissaries arrived in Cairo bearing gifts from Reza Khan such as a &quot;diamond necklace, diamond brooch, diamond earrings&quot;, Farouk was not impressed, taking the Iranian delegation on a tour of his five palaces to show them proper royal splendor and asked if there was anything comparable in Iran. Nonetheless, Farouk agreed in a joint press communique issued with Reza Khan on 26 May 1938, that Princess Fawzia would marry Crown Prince Mohammad Reza, who first learned that he was now engaged to Fawzia when he read the press release.

Farouk broke with Muslim tradition by taking Queen Farida everywhere with him, and letting her go unveiled. On 17 November 1938, Farouk became a father when Farida gave birth to Princess Farial, a considerable disappointment as Farouk wanted a son, all the more because he knew his cousin, Prince Muhammad Ali, was scheming to take the throne. In March 1939, Farouk sent the royal yacht &quot;Mahroussa&quot; to Iran to pick up the Crown Prince. On 15 March 1939, Mohammad Reza married Fawzia in Cairo and afterwards Farouk took his brother-in-law on a tour of Egypt, showing him his five palaces, the Pyramids, Al-Azhar University and other sites in Egypt. In August 1939, Farouk appointed his favorite politician, Maher Pasha, prime minister.

==Reign==
===World War II===

Egypt remained neutral in World War II, but under heavy pressure from Lampson, Farouk broke diplomatic relations with Germany in September 1939. On 7 April 1940, Queen Farida gave birth to a second daughter, Princess Fawzia, which greatly upset Farouk. After Fawzia&#x27;s birth, Farouk&#x27;s marriage started to become strained as he wanted a son. In Egypt, a son was much more valued than daughters for the kingdom&#x27;s legacy; according to Egyptian law at the time a daughter could not inherit the throne, and Farouk was becoming widely viewed as lacking in masculinity due to the absence of a son. Farouk consulted various doctors, who advised him to eat foods that were felt to increase sex drive, and Farouk became something of a bulimic, eating excessively and later becoming overweight. Suspicions that Queen Farida was having an affair with aristocrat Wahid Yussri imposed strains on the marriage.

Under the 1936 treaty, Britain had the right to defend Egypt from an invasion, which turned the Western Desert of Egypt into a battlefield when Italy declared war on Britain on 10 June 1940, and invaded Egypt. Under the 1936 treaty, the Egyptians were obligated to assist the British with logistical services, but Maher frustrated this by appointing corrupt bureaucrats to positions such as presidency of the Egyptian state railroad who demanded &quot;baksheesh&quot; (bribe) in exchange for co-operating. Owing to the strategic importance of Egypt, ultimately 2 million soldiers from Britain, Australia, India and New Zealand arrived in Egypt. Lampson was against Egypt declaring war on the Axis powers despite the Italian invasion of Egypt as having Egypt as a belligerent would mean Egypt would have the right to attend the peace conference once the Allies had won the war, and as Lampson put it, the Egyptians would make demands that would be &quot;embarrassing&quot; for the British at such a peace conference.

Farouk was greatly upset in 1940 when he learned that his mother, Queen Nazli, whom he viewed as a rather chaste figure, was having an affair with his former tutor, Prince Ahmed Hassanein, who as a desert explorer, poet, Olympic athlete and aviator, was one of the most famous Egyptians alive. When Farouk caught Hassanein reading passages from the Koran to his mother in her bedroom, he pulled out a handgun and threatened to shoot them, saying &quot;you are disgracing the memory of my father, and if I end it by killing one of you, then God will forgive me, for it is according to our holy law as you both know&quot;. Distracting Farouk from thoughts of matricide was a meeting on 17 June 1940, with Lampson who demanded that Farouk dismiss Maher as prime minister and General al-Misri as chief of staff of the Egyptian Army, saying both were pro-Axis. Lampson wrote to London: &quot;I repeated I hoped that he realized we were in deadly earnest. He said he knew that full well, and cryptically, that so was he&quot;.

On 28 June 1940, Farouk dismissed Maher Pasha as prime minister, but refused to appoint Nahas Pasha as prime minister as Lampson wanted, saying that Nahas was full of &quot;Bolshevik schemes&quot;. The new prime minister was Hassan Sabry, whom Lampson felt was acceptable, and despite his previous threats to kill him, Prince Hassanein was made &quot;chef de cabinet&quot;. Prince Hassanein had been educated at Oxford University and unusually for an Egyptian, was an Anglophile, having fond memories of his time in England when he studied at Oxford. Lampson had come to detest Farouk by this time, and his favorite advice to London was &quot;the only thing to do is kick the boy out&quot;. In November 1940, the Prime Minister Sabry died of a heart attack when delivering his opening speech to Parliament and was replaced with Hussein Serry Pasha. Farouk felt very lonely as a king, not having any real friends, made worse by the very public feud between Queen Farida and Queen Nazli as the former hated the latter for her attempts to dominate her. Farouk&#x27;s best friend was Pulli, who was more of a &quot;man Friday&quot;. Maher had made contacts on behalf of the king with General al-Misri, on &quot;sick leave&quot; since June 1940; with a group of anti-British officers in the Egyptian Army, and Hassan el Banna, the Supreme Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood, to discuss a possible anti-British uprising when the Axis broke through the British lines. Egypt together with the American South was one of the few places in the world suitable for growing cotton, a water-intensive and labor-intensive crop that was traditionally known as &quot;white gold&quot; owing to the high prices it fetched. World War II created a huge demand for cotton, and after the United States entered the war in late 1941, so many American men were called up for service with the armed forces that Egypt became the only source of cotton for the Allies. For those who owned farmland in Egypt on which cotton was grown, the Second World War was a time of prosperity as the high prices of cotton counteracted the effects of wartime inflation.

The Italians had only advanced within of Egypt before stopping at Sidi Barrani, and on 9 December 1940, the British launched an offensive that drove the Italians back into Libya. In response, in January 1941, German forces were dispatched to the Mediterranean to assist the Italians and on 12 February 1941, the Afrika Korps under the command of Erwin Rommel arrived in Libya. Starting on 31 March 1941, a Wehrmacht offensive drove the British out of Libya and into Egypt. As 95% of Egyptians live in the Nile river valley, the fighting in the Western Desert only affected the Bedouin nomads who lived in the desert. At the same time in 1941 that Rommel was inflicting a series of defeats on the British in the Western Desert, Farouk wrote to Adolf Hitler promising him that when the Wehrmacht entered the Nile river valley, he would bring Egypt into the war on the Axis side. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that the fact that Farouk wanted to see his country occupied by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany was not a sign of great wisdom on his part, but rather because he never understood &quot;that Axis rule of Egypt was likely to be far more oppressive than British&quot;.

During the hardships of the Second World War, criticism was levelled at Farouk for his lavish lifestyle. His decision not to put out the lights at his palace in Alexandria when the city was blacked out because of German and Italian bombing was deemed particularly offensive by the Egyptian people. This was a large contrast to the British royal family back in England, who were well known to have an opposite reaction to the bombings near their home. Owing to the continuing British occupation of Egypt, many Egyptians, Farouk included, were positively disposed towards Germany and Italy, and despite the presence of British troops, Egypt remained officially neutral until the final year of the war. Consequently, Farouk&#x27;s Italian servants were not interned, and there is an unconfirmed story that Farouk told British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson (who had an Italian wife), &quot;I&#x27;ll get rid of my Italians when you get rid of yours&quot;. Many Italians in Egypt, mostly men, were interned in British concentration camps, such as the notorious camp Fayed, outside of Cairo. Treatment of these prisoners in those camps was extreme and physically excessively harsh, many losing inordinate amounts of body weight and contracting typhus. In January 1942, when Farouk was away on vacation, Lampson pressured Serry Pasha into breaking diplomatic relations with Vichy France. As the king was not consulted about the severing of ties with Vichy France, Farouk used this violation of the constitution as an excuse to dismiss Serry and announced he planned to appoint Maher as prime minister again. Serry knew that his government was likely to be defeated on a motion of no confidence when Parliament opened on 3 February 1942, and in the meantime demonstrations by students at Cairo University and Al-Azhar University had broken out, calling for a German victory.

Following a ministerial crisis in February 1942, the British government, through its ambassador in Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, pressed Farouk to have a Wafd or Wafd-coalition government replace Hussein Sirri Pasha&#x27;s government. Lampson had Sir Walter Monckton flown in from London to draft an abdication decree for Farouk to sign as Monckton had drafted the abdication decree for Edward VIII and it was agreed that Prince Muhammad Ali would become the new king. Lampson wanted to depose Farouk, but General Robert Stone and Oliver Lyttleton both argued that if Farouk agreed to appoint Nahas Pasha prime minister that the public reaction to &quot;throwing the boy out for giving us at 9 p.m. the answer which we should have welcomed at 6 p.m.&quot; would be highly negative. Reluctantly, Lampson agreed that Farouk could stay if he agreed to make Nahas prime minister. Farouk asked his military how long the Egyptian Army could hold Cairo against the British and was told at most they could for two hours. On the night of 4 February 1942, soldiers surrounded Abdeen Palace in Cairo and Lampson presented Farouk with an ultimatum. While a battalion of infantry took up their positions around the palace with the roar of tanks could be heard in the distance, Lampson arrived at the Abdeen Palace in his Rolls-Royce together with General Stone. As the doors to Abdeen Palace were locked, one of the officers present used his revolver to shoot open the door and Lampson stormed in, demanding to see the king at once. Farouk initially started to sign the abdication degree that Lampson had placed on his desk, but Prince Hassanein, who was present as a sort of mediator, intervened and spoke to Farouk in Turkish, a language which he knew that Lampson did not speak. Unknown to Lampson, three of Farouk&#x27;s Albanian bodyguards were hiding behind the curtains in his study with orders to shoot the ambassador if he should touch Farouk. Prince Hassanein&#x27;s intervention had its effect, and Farouk turned to Lampson to say he was giving in. Farouk capitulated, and Nahhas formed a government shortly thereafter. However, the humiliation meted out to Farouk, and the actions of the Wafd in co-operating with the British and taking power, lost support for both the British and the Wafd among both civilians and, more importantly, the Egyptian military. At the time, the incident caused the Egyptian people to rally around their king, on 11 February 1942 (his birthday by Western standards), he received was loudly cheered by the crowd on Abdeen Square. General Stone wrote Farouk a letter of apology for the incident. Air Marshal William Sholto Douglas wrote that Lampson had made a huge error in &quot;treating King Farouk as if he were nothing but a naughty and rather silly boy... Farouk was naughty and he was still very young... but to my mind, and taking a hard-headed view, he was also the King of Egypt&quot;.

After the humiliation of the Abdeen Palace incident, Farouk lost interest in politics for the moment, and he abandoned himself to a lifestyle of hedonism as he became obsessed with &quot;collecting&quot; women by sleeping with them, having his closest friend, the Italian valet Antonio Pulli, bring in fair-skinned women from the dance halls and brothels of Cairo and Alexandria to his palaces for sex. Despite his great wealth, Farouk was a kleptomaniac who always took something valuable such as a painting or a piano from whatever member of the Egyptian elite he stayed with, as no one could say no to the king and if he indicated he wanted something, his subjects had to give it to him. When one of the daughters of the Ades family, one of the richest Jewish families in Egypt, rebuffed Farouk&#x27;s advances, he arrived unannounced at the Ades family&#x27;s estate on an island in the Nile with Pulli telling the Adeses that the king had come to hunt the gazelles. Rather than have the kleptomaniac Farouk stay at their estate and wipe out the gazelles on their island, the Adeses agreed that their 16-year-old daughter would go to the Abdeen palace to be courted by the king.

In April 1942, at a luncheon with Lampson and King George II of Greece, Farouk refused to speak to Lampson and told George that he would be wasting his time meeting the Wafd ministers as they were all &quot;ces canailles&quot; (&quot;these scoundrels&quot;). On 2 July 1942, Lampson visited the Abdeen Palace to tell Farouk that there was a real possibility of Axis forces taking Cairo and suggested that the king should flee to Khartoum if the Afrika Corps took Cairo. Farouk who had no intention of decamping to Khartoum simply walked out of the room. After the Battle of El Alamein, the Axis forces were driven out of Egypt and back into Libya, which caused Farouk to change his views over to a markedly pro-British direction. Air Marshal Douglas, one of the few British people whom Farouk was friends with, gave him the uniform of a RAF officer, which became the king&#x27;s favorite uniform.

Farouk had something of a mania for collecting things ranging from Coca-Cola bottles to European art to ancient Egyptian antiques. Farouk became addicted to eating and drinking soft-drinks, ordering his French chefs at the Abdeen palace to cook enormous meals of the finest French food, which he devoured and which caused him to become obese. Farouk came to be known as &quot;the king of the night&quot; owing to the amount of time he spent in the exclusive &quot;Auberge des Pyramides&quot; nightclub in Cairo, where he spent his time socializing, smoking cigars and drinking orangeade. Farouk also indulged in much childish behavior at the &quot;Auberge des Pyramides&quot; like throwing bread balls at the other patrons. Farouks&#x27;s grandfather, Ismail the Magnificent, had rebuilt Cairo in the style of Paris and during Farouk&#x27;s reign, Cairo was considered to be a glamorous city, the most Westernized and wealthy city in the Middle East. As a result, various celebrities from the West were constantly passing through Cairo and were invited to socialize with the king.Farouk also met various Allied leaders. South African Prime Minister Jan Christian Smuts called Farouk &quot;surprisingly intelligent&quot;. U.S. Senator Richard Russell Jr., who represented Georgia, a cotton-growing state, found he had much in common with Farouk and stated he was &quot;an attractive, clear-eyed young man ... very much on the job ... well above the ordinary run of rulers&quot;. The American financier and diplomat Winthrop W. Aldrich discovered that Farouk was very informed about the workings of the international gold market, saying the king had a sharp eye for business. Air Marshal Douglas wrote &quot;I began to genuinely like Farouk. There was no indication then there was anything that was vicious about him, although at times his flippancy became annoying. Another failing of his was that he appeared to be almost fanatically keen on acquiring great wealth ... he revealed all too clearly his shortsightedness in stating openly that one of his main interests in life was to increase that fortune. This led him into currying favor with the rich people in Egypt, as they did with him, at the expense of the common people, in whom he had little or no interest&quot;. Douglas concluded that the king was &quot;an intelligent young man ... he was by no means the fool that he appeared to be through the stupid way in which he quite often behaved in public&quot;. However, a meeting with the British prime minister Winston Churchill in August 1942 when Farouk stole his watch did not make the best impression; though Farouk later returned the watch, presenting his theft of Churchill&#x27;s watch as merely a practical joke, saying he knew &quot;the English had a great sense of humor&quot;. Farouk had pardoned a thief in exchange for teaching him how to be a pickpocket, a skill that Farouk used on Churchill, much to the latter&#x27;s chagrin.

In the time honored fashion, the Wafd government headed by Nahas proved to be an extremely corrupt and Nahas is widely considered to be one of the most corrupt Egyptian prime ministers of all time. Nahas fell out with his patron, Makram Ebeid, and expelled him from the Wafd at the instigation of his wife. Ebeid retaliated with &quot;The Black Book&quot;, a detailed expose published in the spring of 1943 listing 108 cases of major corruption involving Nahas and his wife. On 29 March 1943, Ebeid visited the Abdeen Palace to present Farouk with a copy of &quot;The Black Book&quot; and asked that he dismiss Nahas for corruption. Farouk attempted to use the furor caused by &quot;The Black Book&quot; as an excuse to dismiss the extremely unpopular Nahas, who had become Egypt&#x27;s most hated man, but Lampson warned him via Prince Hassanein that he would be deposed if he dismissed his prime minister. Lampson in a dispatch to Sir Anthony Eden, who was once again Foreign Secretary, argued that Egypt needed political calm and to allow Farouk to dismiss Nahas would cause chaos as the latter would start &quot;ranting&quot; against the British. General Stone recommended that Lampson not be allowed to depose Farouk under the grounds that such a step was likely to cause anti-British rioting in Egypt which would require putting down, which Stone was opposed to on public relations grounds. At the same time, Farouk, notwithstanding his own frequent unfaithfulness, had become enraged when he learned that Queen Farida was having an affair with the British painter, Simon Elwes, who had to flee Egypt to escape. Lampson taunted Farouk when he learned that Queen Farida was pregnant again, saying he hoped she was bearing a son and that the boy was Farouk&#x27;s.

One of Farouk&#x27;s mistresses, Irene Guinle, who was his &quot;official mistress&quot; in the years 1941–1943, described him as something of an immature &quot;man-child&quot; having no interest in politics and given to childish behavior like making bread balls at restaurants &quot;to flip at the fancy people coming in and watch how they&#x27;d act when he hit the mark. How he roared with that laugh&quot;. Guinle in an interview stated: &quot;Farouk never wrote a letter, never read a paper, never listened to music. His idea of culture was movies. He never even played cards until I made the mistake of buying him a &#x27;shoe&#x27; and teaching him how to play &quot;chemin de fer&quot;. He got hooked on that. Farouk was an insomniac. He had three telephones by his bed, which he would use to ring up his so-called friends at three in the morning and invite them to come over to his palace to play cards. No one could refuse the king&quot;.

The British novelist Barbara Skelton replaced Guinle as the &quot;official mistress&quot; in 1943. Skelton called Farouk very immature and &quot;a complete philistine&quot;, saying: &quot;He was very adolescent. He didn&#x27;t have the stuff to be a great king, he was too childish. But he never lost his temper, he was incredibly sweet, with a good sense of humor&quot;.

In November 1943, Farouk went driving with Pulli in his red Cadillac to Ismalia to see a yacht he just purchased when he was involved in an automobile incident when his attempt to bypass a British Army truck by speeding caused him to hit another car head-on. An attempt to place Farouk on a stretcher failed when the overweight king turned out to be too heavy, causing the stretcher to break under his weight. Farouk had suffered two broken ribs as a result of the car accident, but he liked being in a British Army hospital so much, flirting with the nurses, that he pretended to be injured far longer than what he really was. As a result, Farouk missed the Cairo Conference when the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek all arrived in Cairo to discuss war plans against Japan for 1944, though he appeared to have no regrets, preferring to spend his time flirting with the nurses and buying them gifts that were worth more than their annual salaries. On 15 December 1943, Farouk was finally forced to end his convalescence when Farida gave birth to another daughter, Princess Fadia, which disappointed him, and caused him to lash out in anger against her for only giving him daughters. Reflecting a continuing interest in the Balkans, the region where his family came from, Farouk by 1943 hosted King Zog I of Albania, King Peter II of Yugoslavia and King George II of Greece, telling all three kings that he wanted Egypt to play a role in the Balkans after the war, as he was proud of his Albanian ancestry.

In late 1943, Farouk started a policy giving support to student and working men&#x27;s association and in early 1944 paid a visit to Upper Egypt, when he donated money to victims of the malaria epidemic. In April 1944, Farouk attempted to sack Nahas as prime minister over the latter&#x27;s response to the malaria epidemic in Upper Egypt. Reflecting the importance of controlling patronage in Egypt, Nahas Pasha had gone on a separate relief tour of Upper Egypt apart from the king and founded a relief organization, the Nahas Institute, in his own name instead of the king as was normal to treat the thousands sickened with malaria. Farouk told Lampson that &quot;there could not be two kings in Egypt&quot; and the &quot;semi-royal&quot; nature of Nahas&#x27;s tour of Upper Egypt was an insult to him. Farouk attempted to soften the blow by announcing the new prime minister would be the well known Anglophile Prince Hassanein, but Lampson refused to accept him. Lampson attempted to have Farouk deposed again, sending off a telegram to Churchill advising him to take &quot;direct control&quot; of Egypt. Lampson once again threatened Farouk, who remained flippant and dismissive. When Prince Hassanein tried to persuade Lampson to accept the dismissal of the deeply corrupt Wafd government as an improvement, the ambassador was unmoved, leading the normally Anglophile Hassanein to say the Egyptians were getting tired of British influence in their internal affairs. By 1944, the withdrawal of much the British garrison in Egypt together with the view that to depose Farouk would make a nationalist martyr led to much of the British Foreign Office feeling that Lampson&#x27;s constant plans to replace the king would do more harm than good. Lord Moyne, the junior British foreign minister in charge of Middle Eastern affairs, told Lampson that his plans to depose Farouk in 1944 would damage Britain&#x27;s moral position in the world and force the British to send more troops to Egypt to put down the expected riots when the main concern was the Italian theater of operations. General Bernard Paget rejected Lampson&#x27;s plans to depose Farouk as the Egyptian Army was loyal to him, and to depose the king would mean going to war against Egypt, which Paget called an unnecessary distraction.

The day before Farouk was tentatively due to be deposed, Prince Hassanein arrived at the British Embassy with a letter for Lampson saying: &quot;I am commanded by His Majesty to inform Your Excellency that he has decided to leave the present Government in Office for the time being&quot;. As Nahas became unpopular, he sought to embrace Arab nationalism to rally support, having Egypt join the Arab League in October 1944 and speaking more and more about &quot;the Palestine question&quot;. In October 1944, when Lampson went away for a vacation in South Africa, Farouk finally dismissed Nahas as prime minister on 8 October 1944, and replaced him with Ahmed Maher, the brother of Ali Maher. The dismissal of Nahas was seen by Lampson as a personal defeat, who complained in his diary that he would never have a politician &quot;in our pocket&quot; like him again, and was seen as a decisive turning point when Farouk had finally outwitted Lampson. But at the same time, Lampson admitted that Nahas by his corruption had become a liability, and that Britain could not continue to support a corrupt government in the long run, as the British people would not tolerate going to war with Egypt to keep someone like Nahas in office.

On 6 November 1944, Lord Moyne was assassinated in Cairo by two members of the extreme right-wing Zionist group, Lehi, better known as the Stern Gang. The two assassins, Eliyahu Bet-Zuri and Eliyahu Hakim, gunned down Lord Moyne and his chauffeur, but were then captured by the Cairo police. Afterwards, Bet-Zuri and Hakim were tried and sentenced to death by an Egyptian court. Farouk came under strong pressure from American Zionist groups to pardon the two assassins while Lampson pressured him not to pardon the assassins. For a time, Farouk escaped the matter by sailing on the royal yacht &quot;Mahroussa&quot; to Saudi Arabia to go on the &quot;haji&quot; to Mecca and meet King Ibn Saud. In March 1945, the assassins of Lord Moyne were hanged, and for the first time, Farouk was accused in the United States of being anti-Semitic.
Farouk declared war on the Axis Powers, long after the fighting in Egypt&#x27;s Western Desert had ceased. On 13 February 1945, Farouk met President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States on abroad the cruiser USS &quot;Quincy&quot;, anchored in the Great Bitter Lake. Farouk seemed confused by the purpose of the meeting with Roosevelt, talking much about how after the war he hoped more American tourists would visit Egypt and Egyptian-American trade would increase. Though the meeting consisted mostly of pleasantries, Roosevelt did give Farouk the gift of a Douglas C-47 plane, to add to his airplane collection. After meeting Roosevelt, the king met Churchill who according to Lampson:told Farouk that he should take a definite line in regard to the improvement of the social conditions in Egypt. He ventured to affirm that nowhere in the world were the conditions of extreme wealth and extreme poverty so glaring. What an opportunity for a young Sovereign to come forward and champion the interests and living conditions of his people. Why not take from the rich Pashas some of their superabundant wealth and devote it to the improvement of the living conditions of the &quot;fellaheen&quot;?. Farouk was more interested in learning if Egypt would be allowed to join the new United Nations and learned from Churchill that only nations that were at war with the Axis powers would be allowed to join the United Nations, which would replace the League of Nations after the war.

In 1919, it had been a great humiliation for the Egyptians that Egypt had been excluded from the Paris Peace Conference that led to the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations, causing the revolution of 1919. Farouk was determined that this time that Egypt would be a founding member of the United Nations, which would show the world that the country was ending British influence in Egyptian affairs. On 24 February 1945, Prime Minister Maher had the Chamber of Deputies issue declarations of war against Germany and Japan, and as he was leaving the Chamber, he was assassinated by Mahmoud Isawi, a member of the pro-Axis Young Egypt Society. Isawi was shaking Maher&#x27;s hand and then pulled out his handgun, shooting the prime minister three times while screaming that he had betrayed Egypt by declaring war on Germany and Japan. When Lampson arrived at the Koubbeh Palace to see Farouk, he wrote he was shocked instead to see instead &quot;it was the wicked Aly Maher who was receiving condolences&quot;. As a result, Egypt attended the peace conference in San Francisco in April 1945 that founded the United Nations.

The new prime minister, Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha, demanded that the British finally keep the terms of the 1936 treaty by pulling out of the Nile river valley while university students rioted in Cairo demanding the British leave Egypt altogether. Lampson by 1945 was widely seen in Whitehall as a man with an unrealistic view of Anglo-Egyptian relations and only Lampson&#x27;s friendship with Churchill kept him on as an ambassador in Cairo. The new Labour government that came into office in July 1945 wanted a new relationship with Egypt, and Farouk let it be known he wanted a new British ambassador. The new Labour Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, a man of working-class origins, found the aristocratic Lampson to be a snob, and moreover Lampson&#x27;s vehement disapproval of the Labour government&#x27;s policy towards India further isolated him. For all these reasons, Bevin was well disposed to Farouk&#x27;s entreaties to replace Lampson. Farouk had vaguely promised to carry out social reforms, a major concern in London as the wartime inflation had led to increases in support for the Egyptian Communist Party on the left and the Muslim Brotherhood on the right, and was willing to negotiate a new relationship with Britain. Moreover, once the war had ended, the Wafd had returned to its traditional anti-British political position, which led Whitehall to conclude that Farouk was London&#x27;s best hope of keeping Egypt in the British sphere of influence. The Egyptian ambassador in London passed on messages from Farouk blaming Lampson all the problems in Anglo-Egyptian relations, and stated that Farouk would be willing to return to his father&#x27;s policies of opposing the Wafd and of seeking British &quot;moral support&quot; after the war.

===Decline===
Egypt ended the Second World War as the richest country in the Middle East, owing largely to the high prices of cotton. In 1945 in a reversal of the usual roles, Egypt was a creditor nation to the United Kingdom, with the British government owing Egypt £400 million. The stark income disparities of Egyptian society meant the wealth of Egypt was very unequally distributed with the kingdom having 500 millionaires while the &quot;fellaheen&quot; lived in extreme poverty. In 1945, a medical study showed that 80% of Egyptians suffered from bilharzia and ophthalmia, both diseases that were easily preventable and treatable. The authors of the study noted both bilharzia and ophthalmia were spread by waterborne parasitic worms, and the prevalence of both diseases could easily be eliminated in Egypt by providing people with safe sources of drinking water. The bumbling response of the Egyptian authorities to the cholera epidemic in 1947 that killed 80,000 people was an additional cause of criticism as cholera is caused by drinking water contaminated with feces, and the entire epidemic could have been avoided if only ordinary Egyptians had sources of clean drinking water. King Farouk had traditionally posed as the friend of the poor, but by 1945 such gestures that the king liked to engage in such as throwing gold coins at the &quot;fellaheen&quot; or dropping ping-pong balls from his plane that could be redeemed for candy were no longer felt to be sufficient. Increasingly, demands were being made that the king should engage in social reforms instead of theatrical gestures like handing out gold coins during royal visits, and as Farouk was unwilling to consider land reform or improving the water sanitation, his popularity began to decline. Farouk&#x27;s social life also started to damage his image. The American journalist Norbert Schiller wrote &quot;Farouk was seen frequently womanizing at the hottest night spots in Cairo and Alexandria. In Egypt, the king&#x27;s gallivanting was put under wraps by the palace censorship office, but abroad pictures of a fat balding king surrounded by Europe&#x27;s social elite were splashed across the world&#x27;s tabloids.&quot; Farouk&#x27;s only act of self-restraint was that he refused to drink alcohol as however much his lifestyle departed from the one recommended by the Koran, he could not bring himself to break the Muslim prohibition on alcohol.
Farouk&#x27;s chief advisers in ruling Egypt starting in 1945 were his &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; consisting of his right-hand man, Antonio Pulli together with the king&#x27;s Lebanese press secretary Karim Thabet; Elias Andraous, an ethnic Greek from Alexandria whom Farouk valued for his business skills; and Edmond Galhan, a Lebanese arms dealer whose official title was &quot;general purveyor to the Royal Palaces&quot;, but whose real job was to engage in black market activities for the king. Prince Hassanein warned Farouk against his &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot;, saying all of them were greedy, unscrupulous men who abused the king&#x27;s trust to enrich themselves, but Farouk disregarded his advice. In February 1946, Prince Hassanein was killed in an automobile accident, and a secret marriage contract between him and Queen Nazli was found that was dated 1937, which infuriated Farouk.
After much lobbying on the part of Farouk, the new Labour government in London decided to replace Lampson with Sir Ronald Campbell as the British ambassador in Cairo, and on 9 March 1946, Lampson left Cairo, much to the king&#x27;s glee. In May 1946, Farouk granted asylum to former king of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III, who had abdicated on 9 May 1946. Farouk was repaying a family debt as Victor Emmanuel&#x27;s father, King Umberto I, had granted asylum to Farouk&#x27;s grandfather, Ismail the Magnificent, in 1879, but as Victor Emmanuel had supported the Fascist regime, his arrival in Egypt did much damage to Farouk&#x27;s image. In June 1946, Farouk granted asylum to Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who escaped from France where he was being held on charges of being a war criminal, arriving in Egypt on a forged passport. Farouk did not care that al-Husseini was urgently wanted in Yugoslavia on charges of being a Nazi war criminal for his role in organizing the massacres of Bosnian Serbs and Jews. Farouk wanted the British to keep the 1936 agreement by pulling their troops out of Cairo and Alexandria, and felt having notoriously Anglophobic rabble-rousing Grand Mufti in Egypt would be a useful way of threatening them. However, the way that Farouk addressed al-Hussenini as the &quot;king of Jerusalem&quot; appeared to suggest that he envisioned the Grand Mufti as the future leader of a Palestinian state. Starting in June 1946, the British did finally pull out of the Nile river valley and henceforward the only place the British Army were stationed at in Egypt was at the gigantic base around the Suez Canal. In August 1946, the British pulled out of the Citadel in Cairo. By September 1946, the British pull-out from the Nile valley was complete. Farouk continued to press the British to leave Egypt altogether, but the question of who would control the Sudan led to the collapse of the talks in December 1946. Farouk considered the Sudan to be part of Egypt, and wanted the Anglo-Egyptian condominium over the Sudan to end at the same time that the British would pull out of Egypt, which the British were unwilling to accept.

Having the charismatic al-Husseini in Egypt had the effect of focusing attention on the Palestine issue, a matter which most Egyptians had previously ignored, all the more so when al-Husseini made an alliance with Hassan al-Banna, the Supreme Guide of the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, which was rapidly becoming the most powerful mass movement in Egypt with over a million members. Farouk himself welcomed the Grand Mufti to royal receptions, and his speeches calling for &quot;jihad&quot; against Zionism did much to put the &quot;Palestine Question&quot; on the public agenda. Farouk himself was not personally anti-Semitic, having a Jewish mistress, the singer Lilianne Cohen, better known by her stage name Camelia, but given increasing discontent with the very stark income inequalities in Egypt, Farouk felt taking a militantly anti-Zionist line was the best way of distracting public attention. At the Royal Automobile Club in Cairo, Farouk engaged in all night gambling sessions with rich Egyptian Jews despite his professed anti-Zionism and often joked: &quot;Bring me my Zionist enemies so I can take their money!&quot; In December 1947, a demonstration organized by the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo calling for Egyptian intervention in Palestine drew 100,000 people. In November 1947, when Britain announced it was terminating the Palestine Mandate in May 1948, a civil war erupted between the Jewish and Arab populations of Palestine, and the fighting was very extensively covered by the Egyptian media. The stories about atrocities, both real and imagined, against the Palestinians, served to greatly agitate the Egyptian people. Furthermore, there was a widespread belief in Egypt that once the British left Palestine and the Zionists proclaimed a new state to be called Israel, that the resulting war would be an easy &quot;march on Jerusalem&quot; lasting only a few days. In December 1947, a summit of the leaders of the Arab League was held in Cairo to discuss what to do when the Mandate of Palestine came to an end in May 1948. King Abdullah I of Jordan wanted all of Palestine for himself and dismissed Farouk as a pseudo-Arab who should not even be attending the summit, saying with reference to Farouk&#x27;s Albanian ancestry: &quot;You do not make a gentleman out of a Balkan farmer&#x27;s son simply by making him a king&quot;.Reflecting the influence of King Ibn&#x27; Saud of Saudi Arabia who spoke in the same way, Farouk often described Zionism as a ploy by the Soviet Union to take over the Middle East, calling the Zionists Jewish &quot;communists&quot; from Eastern Europe who were working on Moscow&#x27;s instructions to &quot;wreck&quot; the traditional order in the Middle East. Both Farouk and Ibn&#x27; Saud detested Abdullah, and both preferred that a Palestinian state headed by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem be created rather than see Palestine annexed to Jordan or becoming a Jewish state. Farouk did not bother to tell the prime minister Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha about his decision for war with Israel, who only learned of his decision a few days before the war was due to start on 15 May 1948, from the Defense Minister and Chief of the General Staff. Farouk was so convinced that the war would be a victorious &quot;march on Jerusalem&quot; that he had already started planning the victory parade in Cairo before the war started. Farouk was described as &quot;like some boy playing with so many lead soldiers&quot; as he involved himself deeply in the military planning, personally deciding where his army would march when it invaded Palestine. As late as 13 May 1948, Norakshy Pasha was assuring foreign diplomats that Egypt would not attack Israel when it was expected to be proclaimed on 15 May, and Egypt&#x27;s intervention in the war took most observers by surprise. In the diplomacy in the run-up to the war, Egypt was generally seen as a moderate state with Egyptian diplomats repeatedly saying that their country was opposed to a military solution to the &quot;Palestine Question&quot;. Nokrashy in 1947 asked in private if it was possible for the United States to take over the Palestine Mandate when the British left, saying he did not want a war.
In May 1948, the prime minister Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha advised against going to war with Israel, saying the Egyptian Army was not ready for war. However, King Farouk overruled him, as he feared the growing popularity of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was clamoring for war with Israel. Farouk declared that Egypt would fight Israel as otherwise he feared the Muslim Brotherhood would overthrow him. The war with Israel ended in disaster with the Egyptian Army fighting very poorly and Edmond Galhan of the king&#x27;s &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; making a fortune by selling the Egyptian Army defective Italian Army rifles left over from World War II, a matter which greatly angered many Egyptian officers. Though the defective rifles were not the only reason why Egypt was defeated, many Egyptians came to be fixated on the issue, believing if it were not for Galhan, then Egypt would have been victorious. It was after being defeated by Israel that the Abdeen Palace incident of 1942 started to be viewed in Egypt as an abject, contemptible surrender, which showed Farouk&#x27;s cowardice and general lack of leadership.

The Muslim Brotherhood, which had been so hawkish on war with Israel, turned its fury against the government in reaction to the defeats inflicted by Israel and in October 1948, a Brother killed the Cairo police chief, followed up by the governor of the Cairo province. On 17 November 1948, Farouk divorced the very popular Queen Farida which, coming in middle of the losing war with Israel, was a profound shock to the Egyptian people. On the same day, the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlevi, divorced Princess Fawzia. Farouk and Mohammad Reza had planned to divorce their wives on the same day to distract the media from giving too much attention to either of their stories. On 28 December 1948, Prime Minister Nokrashy Pasha was assassinated by a Brother disguised as a policeman. In January 1949, Egypt signed an armistice with Israel with the only gain being the Gaza Strip. In February 1949, the Supreme Guide of the Brotherhood, al-Banna, who called for Farouk&#x27;s overthrow in response to the armistice with Israel, was shot by a Cairo policeman, and was taken to the hospital, where the police prevented him from receiving blood transfusions, causing his death later the same day. Shortly afterward, al-Hussenini left Egypt for Lebanon.In the meantime, Farouk spent his nights at the &quot;Auberge des Pyramides&quot; nightclub with Cohen or his latest mistress, the French singer Annie Berrier. At the same time, Farouk was engaged in a relationship with the American model Patricia &quot;Honeychilde&quot; Wilder, who stated in an interview that of all her lovers, he was the one who had the best sense of humour and made her laugh the most. In September 1949, when Jefferson Caffery arrived in Cairo as the new U.S. ambassador and met Farouk for the first time, the king told Caffery (who came from Louisiana) that just as the South had its blacks good only for picking cotton, so too did Egypt have its &quot;fellaheen&quot; likewise only good for picking cotton. Karim Thabet of the &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot;, a man whom Caffery called a &quot;jackal&quot;, convinced Farouk that the best way of renewing his popularity was to marry again, saying the Egyptian people loved royal weddings and to marry a commoner again would show his populist side. Caffery reported that the king had listed his requirements for his new bride that she be of the &quot;grande bourgeoise&quot; class, be at least 16 years old, be an only child, and be of Egyptian descent only. Thabet selected Narriman Sadek to be the new bride of the king, notwithstanding she was already engaged to Zaki Hashem, a PhD candidate in economics at Harvard University who was working in New York as a United Nations economist. After Farouk had made Sadek&#x27;s father a bey, he broke off her engagement to Hashem who complained to the American press that the king had stolen his fiancée and broken his heart. After Farouk announced his engagement to Sadek, he sent her off to Rome to be taught how to be a proper cultured lady to make her fit to be a queen. In January 1950, in a volte-face that stunned observers of Egyptian politics, Thabet arranged an alliance between the king and Nahas Pasha. Caffery reported to Washington:The proposal was that the King would receive Nahas in private audience prior to summoning a Wafd government and that if the King were not satisfied by his conversation with Nahas, Nahas gave his word of honor that he would retire from the leadership of the Wafd Party ... The King agreed to this proposal and was completely captivated by Nahas, who tactfully started the interview by swearing that his one desire in life was to kiss the King&#x27;s hand and to remain always worthy in His Majesty&#x27;s opinion of being allowed to repeat the performance. At this point Nahas went on his knees before the King who according to Thabet was so charmed that he assisted him to his feet with the words, &quot;Rise, Mr. Prime Minister&quot;. Caffery reported in his cable to Washington that he was appalled that Nahas, whom Caffery called the stupidest and most corrupt politician in Egypt, was now prime minister. Caffery stated that Nahas was unqualified to be prime minister because of his &quot;completely total ignorance of the facts of life as they apply to the situation today&quot;, giving the example: Most observers are willing to concede that Nahas knows of the existence of Korea, but I have found no one who would be willing to seriously contend that he is aware of the fact that Korea borders on Red China. His ignorance is as colossal as it is appalling ... At the time of my interview with Nahas he was totally unconscious of the subject which I was discussing. The only ray of light which penetrated was the fact that I wanted something from him. This prompted the street politician&#x27;s response of &quot;aidez-nous et nous vous aiderons&quot;. Caffery called Nahas a venal &quot;street politician&quot; whose only platform was the &quot;tried and true formula of &#x27;Evacuation and Unity of the Nile Valley&#x27;&quot; and stated the only positive aspect of him as prime minister was that &quot;we can get anything which we want from him if we are willing to pay for it&quot;. Nahas as prime minister proved to be as corrupt and venal as he was during his previous times in office, going on a rampage of rapacious looting of the public coffers to enrich himself and his even more greedy wife. The Korean War caused a shortfall in the American cotton production as young men were called up for national service, causing a cotton boom in Egypt. As the international prices for cotton rose, Egyptian landlords forced their tenant farmers to grow more cotton at the expense of food, leading to major food shortages and inflation in Egypt. In face of the corrupt Nahas government, the Egyptian people looked to their king for leadership who in the meantime had departed for France for a two-month-long bachelor party. Farouk&#x27;s biographer, William Stadiem, wrote about how the king in 1950 &quot;went on the most excessively lavish, self-indulgent bachelor party in the annals of sybaritism.

In 1950, Farouk&#x27;s fortune was estimated to be about £50 million or about US$140 million, making him into one of the world&#x27;s richest men, and a billionaire many times over in today&#x27;s money. Farouk&#x27;s wealth and his lifestyle made the centre of media attention all over the world. In August 1950, Farouk visited France to stay at the casino at Deauville for his bachelor party, leaving Alexandria on his yacht &quot;Fakr el Bihar&quot; with an Egyptian destroyer as an escort and landed at Marseilles. Farouk together his entourage consisting of his &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot;, 30 Albanian bodyguards, assorted Egyptian secretaries and doctors, Sudanese food tasters and various other followers traveled across the French countryside in a column of 7 Cadillacs surrounded by motorcycle-riding bodyguards and an airplane flying overhead with orders to land in case Farouk wanted to fly instead. Upon the king arriving in Deauville, a media circus began as hundreds of journalists from Europe and North America descended on Deauville to report on Farouk&#x27;s every doing as he stayed at the Hotel du Golf with his entourage occupying 25 rooms. Journalists watched on as the corpulent king gorged himself on food, eating in one single meal dishes of &quot;sole à crème&quot;, &quot;côte de veau à la crème&quot;, &quot;framboises à la crème&quot;, and &quot;champignons à la crème&quot;, each dish tasted in advance by Farouk&#x27;s Sudanese food tasters. At his first night at the casino in Deauville, Farouk won 20 million francs (about $57,000 U.S. dollars) gambling at baccarat, and on his second night won 15 million francs. As Farouk spent extravagant sums of money during his visit to Deauville, staying at the casino every night until 5 am, he earned himself a reputation for flamboyant high living that never went away.

From Deauville, Farouk went to Biarritz, where he stayed at the Hotel du Palais and resumed his friendship with the Duke of Windsor as the former King Edward VIII was now known. Farouk then crossed over to San Sebastian in Spain to attend a film festival with four &quot;of his ladies of the moment&quot; as the British ambassador to Spain called them. Farouk&#x27;s next stop was Cannes, where he engaged on the night of 22 September in a $80,000 game of chemin de fer at the Palm Beach Casino with the Nawab of Palanpur, the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli, the Hollywood mogul Jack L. Warner and the British industrialist Myers &quot;Lucky Mickie&quot; Hyman. Hyman won the game and then promptly died of a heart-attack, leading to newspaper headlines such as &quot;Lucky Mickie Beats Farouk-and Dies!&quot; Finally, Farouk ended his bachelor party in San Remo in Italy where he purchased a number of Roman antiques at an auction to add to his collection and afterwards arrived in Alexandria in October 1950. Upon his return, Farouk received an anonymous public letter from the &quot;opposition&quot; which warned &quot;a revolt is near; that would not only destroy those who are unjust but would leave the country in a state of financial, moral and political bankruptcy&quot;. The letter warned: Circumstances have placed in the palace certain officials who do not deserve that honor. These ill-advised and mishandle matters. Some of them have even come under suspicion that they are implicated in the arms scandal effecting our valiant army. The belief prevails that justice will be incapable of touching these officials, just as the belief has prevailed ... that Parliamentary government has become mere ink on paper. The world press describes us as a public that bears injustice slightly and says we do not know that we are being maltreated and driven like animals. God knows that our breasts are boiling with anger, and that only a little hope restrains us ... The country remembers the happy days when Your Majesty was the honest good shepherd. All the hopes of the country were concentrated on Your Majesty. No occasion passed when the country did not demonstrate its loyalty and sincerity to Your Majesty.

To distract the Egyptian people from anger at the vast expenses occurred by Farouk&#x27;s two-month-long bachelor party, Farouk choose to go on the political offensive by demanding the British leave Egypt altogether. Prime Minister Nahas announced on the opening of the Parliament on 6 November 1950, that the government&#x27;s chief priority for this term would be seeking the removal of all British forces from Egypt and the end of the Anglo-Egyptian condominium of the Sudan, asserting the Sudan was rightfully part of Egypt. About the corruption of Nahas, Farouk joked to Caffery about the original profession of Muhammad Ali the Great: &quot;Don&#x27;t think I know nothing of business matters. Don&#x27;t forget that the founder of my dynasty was a tobacco merchant&quot;. To provide further distraction, on 11 February 1951, Farouk announced the date of his wedding to Narriman Sadek, whom he married in his usual lavish style on 6 May 1951. The Sudanese singer Hawa Al-Tagtaga sang at their wedding.

However, whatever goodwill Farouk acquired by his wedding was lost by his three-month-long honeymoon in Europe, where both he and his new queen spent vast amounts of money while the king ate gargantuan amounts of food in the day during the holy month of Ramadan. In Turin, Farouk purchased from Fiat a $2 million US private train to ship back to Egypt complete with a TV, air-conditioning, 14 phones and alligator-trimmed furniture, which he took the press on during a trial run. At Cannes, Farouk played a 7-hour game of baccarat against the Hollywood mogul Darryl F. Zanuck and lost some $150, 000, a record sum. In Paris, Queen Narriman brought from Hollywood the dress designer, Marusia, to create a custom wardrobe for her. Throughout the honeymoon in France, Italy, and Switzerland, the royal couple were followed by &quot;paparazzi&quot;, much to the king&#x27;s vexation. The &quot;paparazzi&quot; who took photos of him sunbathing by a pool with a bottle of Vichy in a champagne bucket, which he feared would be misconstrued by the &quot;Zionist papers&quot; that he was drinking alcohol. Caffery reported to Washington that a popular rumor had it because Farouk&#x27;s wealth abroad was worth about $75 million US dollars, that he would not return to Egypt, leading to a &quot;precarious&quot; situation that might have led to a communist revolution, but that &quot;all sources agree the King still likes being king&quot;. While Farouk was on his honeymoon in Europe, Nahas had passed a law forbidding farmers from growing wheat, which had lessened the food shortages and inflation, as he wanted to maximise cotton production. In Paris, Farouk told the Aga Khan that he was feeling depressed over his &quot;unnatural&quot; alliance with Nahas, saying he knew he was becoming unpopular and he would appoint a new prime minister when he returned. However, Nahas struck first by unilaterally abrogating the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian treaty in October 1951, making himself the hero of the hour.

On 17 October 1951, the Egyptian government got Parliamentary approval to cancel the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. Nahas told Parliament: &quot;It was for Egypt that I signed the 1936 treaty and it is for Egypt that I call on you to abrogate it&quot;. As a result, the British forces in the Suez Canal were considered enemy forces and King Farouk was declared &quot;King of Egypt and Sudan&quot;. This title was not recognised by many countries, and Egypt entered diplomatic debates as well as internal political unrest. As the British refused to leave their base around the Suez Canal, the Egyptians cut off all food and water to the base, ordered a boycott of British goods, recalled all of the Egyptian workers on the base and began guerrilla attacks, turning the area around the Suez Canal into a war zone.

In December 1951, Farouk backed General Sirri Amer for the president of the Cairo Officers&#x27; Club, and in a surprise upset, Amer was defeated in the election by General Mohamed Naguib, which was the first public sign of military dissatisfaction with the king as the secret Free Officers group had issued pamphlets urging other officers to vote for Naguib under the slogan &quot;The Army says NO to Farouk&quot;. Farouk invalidated the results of the election and ordered an investigation of the Free Officers. Queen Narriman gave birth to Crown Prince Fuad on 16 January 1952, finally giving Farouk a son. Farouk was so pleased that he made Dr. Magdi who delivered Fuad a pasha. On 24 January 1952, Egyptian guerrillas attacked the British base at the Suez Canal, during which the Egyptian Auxiliary Police were observed helping the guerrillas. In response, General George Erskine on 25 January had British tanks and infantry surround the auxiliary police station in Ismailia and gave the police an hour to surrender their arms under the grounds the police were arming the guerrillas. The police commander called the Interior Minister, Fouad Serageddin, Nahas&#x27;s right-hand man, who was smoking cigars in his bath at the time, to ask what to do. Serageddin ordered the police to fight &quot;to the last man and the last bullet&quot;. The resulting battle saw the police station leveled and 43 policemen killed together with 3 soldiers.

The Battle of Ismailia outraged Egypt and the next day, 26 January 1952, was &quot;Black Saturday&quot;, as the riot was known, that saw much of downtown Cairo which Ismail the Magnificent had rebuilt in the style of Paris, burned down. Shepheard&#x27;s Hotel, which long been a symbol of British power in Egypt, was burned down together with Groppi&#x27;s, the most famous restaurant in Cairo, and Cicurel&#x27;s, the most famous shopping centre. Serageddin ordered the police not to intervene during the Black Saturday riot, which saw 26 people killed and over 400 cinemas, cabarets, nightclubs, bars, restaurants and shops burned down in downtown Cairo. During the Black Saturday riot, Farouk was at the Abdeen Palace holding a luncheon attended by 600 guests to celebrate the birth of Fuad, and first became aware of the riot, when he noticed the black cloud of smoke rising up from downtown Cairo. Though Farouk ordered the Egyptian Army to put down the riot, it was too late and the fashionable and glamorous downtown Cairo built by his grandfather was destroyed that day. Farouk blamed the Wafd for the Black Saturday riot, and dismissed Nahas as prime minister the next day. Nahas and the rest of the Wafd leaders were so shocked by the fury of the &quot;Black Saturday&quot; riot that they meekly accepted Farouk&#x27;s dismissal without protest.

The &quot;Black Saturday&quot; riot was the beginning of a crisis of legitimacy in Egypt&#x27;s institutions, including the monarchy, as the riot had starkly shown that most Egyptians did not feel their political system represented them. The American historian Joel Gordon wrote that &quot;Black Saturday&quot; forced &quot;Egypt&#x27;s political leaders to confront the severity of the crisis which the country faced&quot;. For the next six months, Farouk frequently shuffled prime ministers in an attempt to quell widespread demands for reform. The sense of crisis was captured by the widespread call for &quot;salvation ministries&quot; and a &quot;just tyrant&quot; that would end corruption, secure the evacuation of the British from the canal zone, and institute social reforms. Each of the prime ministers in the period January–July 1952 were judged by this criterion. The popular slogan was &quot;al-tathir qabl al-tahrir&quot; (&quot;purification before liberation&quot;), namely a leader who would make Egypt strong enough to force the British to leave. The Battle of Ismailia had shown that Egypt was too weak to militarily expel the British from the Canal zone, and the principal criticism of Farouk and Nahas was that they recklessly launched the &quot;popular struggle&quot; that Egypt could not hope to win. After the Battle of Ismailia, the feeling amongst the policial classes was that Egypt had to end the &quot;popular struggle&quot; and negotiate a British withdrawal, which underlined Egypt&#x27;s weakness. Gordon called Farouk an unscrupulous leader with a &quot;shrewd ability for statecraft&quot; who could have posed as the &quot;just tyrant&quot; if it was not for his addiction to gluttony and partying. Sir Ralph Stevenson, the British ambassador, reported that &quot;where own amusement and distraction are concerned, the king is fighting a losing battle against the man&quot;. Farouk&#x27;s more responsible advisers like Hussein Serry Pasha together with Andraous of the &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; tried their best to persuade the king to pose as the &quot;just tyrant&quot;, but were constantly sabotaged by Pulli, Galhan and Thabet.

Nahas was replaced with Ali Maher who wanted to negotiate an exit agreement with the British and sought in turn to have the Wafd support his government to provide him with the necessary votes in parliament. One of Maher&#x27;s first acts was an anti-inflation bill lowering the prices of basic staples and another was an anti-corruption bill, both of which were popular, but his unwillingness to prosecute the Wafd leaders for &quot;Black Saturday&quot; as Farouk wanted ensured his dismissal. On 2 March 1952, Maher was sacked and replaced with Ahmed Naguib el-Hilaly as prime minister. Hilaly had a reputation for incorruptibility and began a crackdown on corruption while having Serageddin arrested for charges of complicity in the &quot;Black Saturday&quot; riot. Hilaly also announced he was would pursue &quot;purification before liberation&quot;, namely prosecute the Wafd leaders for corruption and &quot;Black Saturday&quot; before tackling the question of the British evacuation. In early May 1952, Farouk confessed to Caffery that Hilaly was his last hope as for once he did not have an alternative prime minister if he should have to sack him.

Thabet told Caffery that the prime minister&#x27;s Fortunes Bill, which would require all past, present and future cabinet ministers to reveal the origins of their wealth would destroy the monarchy saying that by purging the Wafd a veritable Pandora&#x27;s box would be open and Egypt would go through a Roman holiday of charges and counter-charges which could only result in the man-in-the-street becoming aware of the fact that he has been ruled by crooks of various colorations for at least the past ten years ... such an awareness could only result in a further deterioration of the King&#x27;s reputation with the people for having held him responsible for the naming of such men to his Cabinets ... His conclusion was that Hilay Pasha must be discharged from office immediately. Owing to pressure from Thabet and rest of the &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot;, Hilaly was sacked and replaced with Hussein Serry Pasha as prime minister on 1 July 1952. The popular rumour in Cairo had it that Ahmed &#x27;Abbud, a Wafdist industrialist had paid a million Egyptian pound bribe to the king to sack Hilaly before he lost his monopoly on sugar production that he had bought from Nahas. Serry was well regarded, but his reputation as the &quot;king&#x27;s man&quot; together with a genial, easy-going personality that made him unsuitable for the role of a &quot;just tyrant&quot; ensured that nobody took him seriously. Alone of the four prime ministers between January–July 1952, Serry sensed rising discontent in the ranks of the Army officer corps. Thabet then issued a press release claiming that genealogists had discovered that Farouk was a direct descendant of Muhammad, a claim that caused widespread mockery. General Mohammad Naguib wrote: &quot;If there was any Arabic blood in Farouk&#x27;s veins, it was so diluted that it couldn&#x27;t possibly have been traced back to Mohammad and it was a sacrilege for anyone to have tried to do so&quot;.

Farouk was always very anti-communist, but by 1952, a conviction arose among American decision-makers that based on the way that things were going in Egypt, a communist revolution was inevitable unless the government started social reforms at once. Caffery reported to Washington that the Egyptian Communist Party was growing in popularity and it was the Egyptian Communists who were behind the &quot;Black Saturday&quot; riot. In what became known as Project FF (Fat Fucker), officers of the Central Intelligence Agency led by Kermit Roosevelt Jr. were in contact with Free Officers. The extent and importance of American assistance to the Free Officers has been hotly debated by historians with the historian P. J. Vatikiotis maintaining that various CIA officers in their memoirs such as Miles Copeland Jr. in his 1969 autobiography &quot;The Game of Nations&quot; vastly exaggerated their role assisting the Free Officers.

Farouk is also reported as having said &quot;The whole world is in revolt. Soon there will be only five Kings left—the King of England, the King of Spades, the King of Clubs, the King of Hearts, and the King of Diamonds.&quot;

==Overthrow==

Farouk was widely condemned by his people for his corrupt and ineffectual governance, failure to expel foreign influence in Egypt&#x27;s affairs, and the Egyptian army&#x27;s failure in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War to stop the expulsion of Palestinians by paramilitary Zionist forces and to prevent the creation of the state of Israel. Public discontent against Farouk rose to new levels, to the extent that the 1951 film &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; was banned in Egypt out of the fear the audiences would identify the fat Emperor Nero played by Peter Ustinov with Farouk. Farouk usually spent his summers in Alexandria to escape the summer heat in Cairo, and on the night of 20 July was gambling at the Royal Automobile Club when he received a phone call from Prime Minister Serry saying he had learned from a police spy that the Free Officers were planning to launch a coup sometime that summer. Serry also warned that Farouk&#x27;s plans to appoint General Sirri Amer, a man deeply involved in the arms scandal, as War Minister would turn the officer corps against him; a plan that ultimately failed when even General Amer realised he was too unpopular with the officer corps to be an effective War Minister, causing him to refuse the appointment. When Farouk asked Serry to read out a list of who was involved in the conspiracy, he laughingly dismissed them as too junior to pose a threat, appointed his brother-in-law Ismail Chirine War Minister with orders to &quot;clean up&quot; the Army and returned to the Montaza Palace, unworried.

The appointment of Chirine as War Minister spurred the Free Officers into action, and on 22 July their leaders, General Muhammad Naguib and Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, decided on a coup the next day. Learning from one of his spies that the coup was due to begin tomorrow, at about 7 pm, Farouk ordered the arrest of all the Free Officers. Two Free Officers living in Alexandria were so convinced the coup would fail that the evening of 23 July that they went to the Montaza palace to confess and seek a royal pardon. Finally, on the night of 23 July 1952, the Free Officers, led by Naguib and Nasser, staged a military coup that launched the Egyptian revolution of 1952. The Free Officers, knowing that warrants had been issued for their arrest, launched the coup that night, storming the staff headquarters in Cairo, killing two and wounding two on the night of 23 July and by about 1:30 am, Cairo was under their control.

In Alexandria, Farouk appealed to Caffery for help, accusing the Free Officers of all being Communists. Despite the strained relations with Britain, Farouk also appealed to Britain to intervene; the &quot;Black Saturday&quot; riot had convinced the Churchill government that to intervene in Egypt would entail guerrilla warfare in the Nile river valley, which ruled out intervention. Ali Maher, who sided with the Free Officers and was appointed prime minister by them, arrived in Alexandria on 24 July to tell Farouk that the Free Officers wanted Naguib to be War Minister and the dismissal of his &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot;. On 25 July, Farouk went with a machine gun by his side to the Ras El Tin Palace, driving his red Mercedes-Benz down the streets of Alexandria at high speed. The Ras El Tin Palace was located right by Alexandria harbor under the guns of the Egyptian Navy&#x27;s warships, as the Navy had stayed loyal. Farouk had his loyal Sudanese Guard, which was 800 strong, build barricades around the palace. Late on the morning of 25 July, the palace was surrounded by troops loyal to the Free Officers, who attempted to storm it, only to be repulsed by the Sudanese Guard. Farouk, who was an expert marksman, used his hunting gun to kill four of the attackers himself as they sought to race across the palace grounds. After several hours of fighting, Caffery was able to arrange a ceasefire.

On the morning of 26 July 1952, Maher arrived at the Ras El Tin Palace to present Farouk with an ultimatum drafted by Naguib telling the king he must abdicate and leave Egypt by 6 pm the next day or else the troops loyal to the Free Officers would storm the palace and execute the king. By this time, tanks and artillery had arrived outside the palace, and Farouk agreed to abdicate. At about 12:30 pm, Farouk, in the presence of a Supreme Court justice and Caffery, nearly cried as he signed the instrument of abdication. At about 5:30 pm Farouk left the palace, was saluted by the Sudanese Guard, said farewell to his best friend Pulli who was not allowed to leave Egypt, and at the dock, boarded the royal yacht &quot;El Mahrousa&quot; to leave Egypt for the last time. The &quot;Mahrousa&quot; was the same yacht that had taken Ismail the Magnificent to Italy when he was deposed in 1879, which Farouk kept brooding about during his voyage to Naples. The Abaza family&#x27;s Fouad Pasha Abaza, a businessman who held several official positions, notably sent the only message that King Farouk of Egypt received on the royal yacht as he was exiled from Egypt.

Farouk was forced to abdicate and went into exile in Monaco and Italy, where he lived for the rest of his life, arriving in Naples on 29 July 1952. Immediately following his abdication, Farouk&#x27;s baby son, Ahmed Fuad, was proclaimed King Fuad II, but for all intents and purposes Egypt was now governed by Naguib, Nasser, and the Free Officers. On 18 June 1953, the revolutionary government formally abolished the monarchy, ending 150 years of the Muhammad Ali dynasty&#x27;s rule, and Egypt was declared a republic.

===Confiscated possessions===
The Egyptian government quickly moved to auction off the King&#x27;s vast collection of trinkets and treasures, including his seven-piece bedroom suite that was inspired by Napoleon and Josephine&#x27;s suite at the Château de Malmaison. Among the more famous of his possessions was one of the rare 1933 double eagle coins, though the coin disappeared before it could be returned to the United States. (It later reappeared in New York in 1996 and was eventually sold at auction for more than seven million dollars.) Attracting much prurient interest both in Egypt and abroad was the revelation that Farouk owned one of the largest collections of pornography in the world, as he possessed a vast collection numbering into the hundreds of thousands of pornographic photographs, postcards, calendars, playing cards, watches, glasses, and so on. Farouk&#x27;s obsession with collecting also ranged into diamonds, dogs, stamps, rubies, Fabergé eggs, ancient Tibetan coins, medieval suits of armour, aspirin bottles, razor blades, paper clips and Geiger counters. At the Koubbeh Palace, it was discovered that Farouk had collected 2,000 silk shirts, 10,000 silk ties, 50 diamond-studded golden walking sticks and one autographed portrait of Adolf Hitler.

The 94-carat Star of the East diamond and another diamond bought from Harry Winston had not been paid for by the time of the King&#x27;s overthrow in 1952; three years later an Egyptian government legal board entrusted with the disposal of the former royal assets, ruled in Winston&#x27;s favour. Nevertheless, several years of litigation were needed before Winston was able to reclaim the Star of the East from a safe-deposit box in Switzerland.

==Exile and death==

Farouk fled Egypt in great haste, and his abandoned possessions—including a huge collection of pornography—became objects of curiosity and ridicule. On his exile from Egypt, Farouk settled first in Naples, and later in Rome. At his first press conference on 30 July 1952, on the island of Capri, Farouk took questions in English, French and Italian, maintaining he was now a poor man, though reporters noted he hired Carlo d&#x27;Emilio, a Rome lawyer known in Italy as the &#x27;king of lawyers&#x27;, to represent him. D&#x27;Emilo found Farouk the Villa Dusmet, a huge estate outside of Rome, which he rented and became his home. In October 1952, Farouk was indicted for treason in Egypt, though no extradition request was filed with the Italian government. In his exile, Farouk became known as the &#x27;king of the night&#x27;, as he spent his nights at Roman nightclubs in the company of various starlets who had come to Rome to work in either the Italian film industry and/or the Hollywood productions which were filmed in 1950s Italy because of the low lira. Despite his claims of poverty, Farouk had all of his children educated at the Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland, one of the most exclusive and expensive private schools in the world.

On 13 March 1953, the former Queen Narriman left Farouk to return to Egypt, where she filed for divorce in September 1953, citing his unfaithfulness as her reason. Farouk chose the Miss Naples of 1953, Irma Capece Minutolo, to be his last &#x27;official&#x27; mistress. Her parents disapproved of their teenage daughter being courted by a much older, married man, but after Farouk offered a considerable sum of money, they consented to their daughter losing her virginity to him. One of Farouk&#x27;s best friends during his Italian exile was the mobster Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano who had been deported to Italy, and Farouk &#x27;bought&#x27; Luciano&#x27;s mistress, the Swedish writer Birgitta Stenberg, to be his mistress. Farouk&#x27;s relationship with Stenberg ended over his refusal to promote her up to &#x27;official mistress&#x27; status as she wanted. Ultimately, Capece Minutolo objected to living in the Villa Dusmet, which she considered a gloomy and depressing estate, and Farouk moved into a luxury apartment on the Via Archimede in Rome. Shortly afterwards, Farouk fired one of his aides, Amin Fahim, for trying to seduce his 14-year-old daughter, Princess Ferial, whom he subsequently discovered had been working as a spy for Egypt.

On 29 April 1958, the United Arab Republic, a federation of Egypt and Syria, issued rulings revoking his citizenship. He was granted Monegasque citizenship in 1959 by his close friend Prince Rainier III. Farouk&#x27;s daughter, Princess Ferial, recalled that in exile he was a loving father whose only rules for her as a teenager were that she never wear a dress that exposed any decolletage or dance to rock n&#x27; roll music, which he hated. In his last years, Farouk lived with Capece Minutolo, continued to visit nightclubs to gamble and socialise, and spent his days at the Café de Paris on Rome&#x27;s Via Veneto, drinking coffee, smoking cigars and talking to anybody who approached him. Farouk disapproved of the social changes of the 1960s, and often wished he could relive his youth in the 1930s.

He collapsed at the Ile de France restaurant in Rome after a midnight dinner of oysters and lamb, was rushed to San Camillo Hospital, and died immediately thereafter on 18 March 1965. While some claim he was poisoned by Egyptian Intelligence, no official autopsy was conducted on his body. His will stipulated that he be buried in the Al Rifa&#x27;i Mosque in Cairo, but the request was denied by the Egyptian government under Gamal Abdel Nasser, and he was buried in Italy. The funeral service held in Rome was attended by his mother, Nazli Sabri. King Faisal of Saudi Arabia stated he would be willing to have King Farouk buried in Saudi Arabia, upon which President Nasser said that the former monarch could be buried in Egypt, but not in Rifai&#x27; mosque. The body of King Farouk returned to Egypt on 31 March 1965, at night and was secretly buried in Hosh al-Basha, the Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt Burial Site in Imam Al-Shafi&#x27;i area. During Anwar El-Sadat&#x27;s presidency, the remains of King Farouk were moved to Al-Rifa&#x27;i Mosque, where Muhammad Ali Pasha, the founder of the Egyptian dynasty, and the rest of his descendants are buried.

==Marriages and affairs==

Farouk was married twice, with a claim of a third marriage. His first wife was Safinaz Zulficar (1921–1988), the daughter of Youssef Zulficar Pasha. Safinaz was renamed Farida upon her marriage. They were married in January 1938. The marriage was under a large amount of stress due to Queen Farida&#x27;s inability to produce a male heir, which Farouk found essential to maintain his throne. After producing three daughters, the couple divorced in 1948.

In 1950, Farouk was smitten by a commoner named Narriman Sadek (1933–2005) and after courting, the two married in 1951. Sadek was eighteen years old when she married the king and many believed the attraction was due to Farouk&#x27;s belief that she would give him the male heir he desired. He got what he wanted when Sadek gave birth to the future King Fuad II on 16 January 1952. However, months after the prince&#x27;s birth the king and his queen were expelled from Egypt, and divorced in 1954.
He also had many affairs, among them, in 1950, British writer Barbara Skelton. In 1955 his eye fell on the Boston socialite-become-singer Pat Rainey. While in exile in Italy, Farouk met Irma Capece Minutolo, an opera singer, who became his companion. In 2005, she said she married the former King in 1957.

===Children===
==Hobbies==
Farouk and Dick Powell were the only two known buyers of the Gaylord Gladiator automobile.

===Coin collection===
King Farouk amassed one of the most famous coin collections in history which included an extremely rare American gold minted 1933 double eagle coin and (non-concurrently), two 1913 Liberty Head nickels.

The 1954 auction of the exiled King Farouk&#x27;s coin collection was the biggest auction of the 20th century, The Egyptian government sold the collection, and London&#x27;s Baldwin and Co. was commissioned to describe the coins.

===Style and personality===

The ostentatious king&#x27;s name is used to describe imitation Louis XV-style furniture known as &quot;Louis-Farouk&quot;. The imperial French style furniture became fashionable among Egypt&#x27;s upper classes during Farouk&#x27;s reign so Egyptian artisans began to mass-produce it. The style uses ornate carving, is heavily gilded, and is covered in elaborate cloth. The style, or imitations thereof, remains widespread in Egypt. The originals such as Aubusson and Gobelin came directly from France and are not copied in Egypt.

Farouk&#x27;s eccentricities were exaggerated by later accounts. One apocryphal story tells how Farouk suffered from nightmares in which he was chased by a lion. He sought the advice of pro-Axis rector Mustafa al-Maraghi, who told him, &quot;You will not rest until you have shot a lion.&quot; Thereupon, Farouk shot two, at the Cairo zoo.

==In popular culture==
In 1952, Farouk&#x27;s former mistress, Barbara Skelton, published a novel entitled &quot;A Young Girl&#x27;s Touch&quot; about a proper and prim young English woman named Melinda who has an affair with a grotesquely obese Middle Eastern monarch named King Yoyo who enjoys spanking her. Skelton later admitted &quot;A Young Girl&#x27;s Touch&quot; was a &quot;roman à clef&quot; with Melinda being herself and King Yoyo was King Farouk. Gore Vidal&#x27;s 1953 pulp novel &quot;Thieves Fall Out&quot; is set against his overthrow. In 1954, the film &quot;Abdulla the Great&quot; was partially shot in Egypt in the Abdeen Palace and the Koubbeh Palace, and concerns the story of a fat and fabulously rich Middle Eastern king who lusts after a British model. The film was released in 1955. The film&#x27;s producer, Gregory Ratoff, stated during the filming: &quot;If you ask me officially if it is about Farouk, I must tell you no! No!&quot; before going on to say the film was about a &quot;playboy monarch, a gambler, a money-crazed king with an enthusiasm for life and women ... if the world see Farouk in the character of the star, then we can do nothing about it&quot;. Farouk&#x27;s Italian lawyer, Carlo d&#x27;Emilio, reportedly threatened on behalf of Farouk to sue for libel if the character of &quot;Abdulla the Great&quot; was too much like Farouk.

Agatha Christie&#x27;s short story &quot;The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding&quot; involves the theft of a jewel from a fictional Eastern prince who is somewhat irresponsible and fond of a luxurious lifestyle. His name and origin are not given in the original story, but in the 1991 television adaptation in the series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; (where the story appears under its American title, &quot;The Theft of the Royal Ruby&quot;), the story is altered and the prince identified as Farouk (played by Tariq Alibai). This adaptation sees Farouk recovering a jewel to maintain his standing in his home country, eventually succeed his father Fuad I of Egypt to the throne, and curb the influence of the nationalist Wafd Party.

English science-fiction and fantasy author John Whitbourn published &quot;The Book of Farouk&quot;, a fictional &quot;autobiography&quot; by Farouk, depicting him as a towering global statesman bestriding 20th-century history, and an incomparable erotic &quot;artiste&quot; besides. &quot;Nothing is True...: The First Book of Farouk&quot; was published in 2018, followed in 2019 by its concluding companion, &quot;And Everything is Permissible - The Second Book of Farouk&quot;, covering the deposed king&#x27;s sybaritic European exile, 1952–1965. The latter&#x27;s title completes the former&#x27;s citing of valedictory words attributed to Hassan-i Sabbah, 12th-century founder of the Order of Assassins.

* In 2007, the MBC aired an Egyptian television series titled &quot;Al Malik Farouk&quot; about the life of King Farouk and he was portrayed by Syrian actor Taym Hassan.
* Bestselling author Warren Adler&#x27;s (&quot;The War of the Roses&quot;) historical thriller &quot;Mother Nile&quot; follows a fictionalised account of several characters devastated by life in Cairo, Egypt during King Farouk&#x27;s reign.

* &quot;Who do you think you are, King Farouk?&quot; was a common verbal admonishment used among parents in English speaking countries to their children during the mid-1950s to late 1960s.

<doc id="52024" wikidata="Q339025" url="?curid=52024" title="MIM-104 Patriot">
<text>The MIM-104 Patriot is a mobile interceptor missile surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, the primary such system used by the United States Army and several allied states. It is manufactured by the U.S. defense contractor Raytheon and derives its name from the radar component of the weapon system. The AN/MPQ-53 at the heart of the system is known as the &quot;Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target&quot;, which is a backronym for &quot;Patriot&quot;. In 1984, the Patriot system began to replace the Nike Hercules system as the U.S. Army&#x27;s primary high to medium air defense (HIMAD) system and the MIM-23 Hawk system as the U.S. Army&#x27;s medium tactical air defense system. In addition to these roles, Patriot has been given a function in the U.S. Army&#x27;s anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system. , the system is expected to stay fielded until at least 2040.

Patriot uses an advanced aerial interceptor missile and high-performance radar systems. Patriot was developed at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, which had previously developed the Safeguard ABM system and its component Spartan and hypersonic Sprint missiles. The symbol for Patriot is a drawing of a Revolutionary War–era minuteman.

The MIM-104 Patriot has been widely exported. Patriot was one of the first tactical systems in the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to employ lethal autonomy in combat. The system was successfully used against Iraqi missiles in the 2003 Iraq War, and has also been used by Saudi and Emirati forces in the Yemen conflict against Houthi missile attacks. The Patriot system achieved its first undisputed shootdowns of enemy aircraft in the service of the Israeli Air Defense Command. Israeli MIM-104D batteries shot down two Hamas UAVs during Operation Protective Edge in August 2014, and in September 2014, an Israeli Patriot battery shot down a Syrian Air Force Sukhoi Su-24 which had penetrated the airspace of the Golan Heights, achieving the system&#x27;s first known shootdown of a crewed enemy aircraft.

==Introduction==
Prior to the Patriot, Raytheon was involved in a number of surface to air missile programs, including FABMDS (Field Army Ballistic Missile Defense System), AADS-70 (Army Air-Defense System – 1970) and SAM-D (Surface-to-Air Missile – Development). In 1975, the SAM-D missile successfully engaged a drone at the White Sands Missile Range. In 1976, it was renamed the PATRIOT Air Defense Missile System. The MIM-104 (Mobile Interceptor Missile 104) Patriot combined several new technologies, including the MPQ-53 passive electronically scanned array radar and track-via-missile guidance.

Full-scale development of the system began in 1976 and it was deployed in 1984. Patriot was used initially as an anti-aircraft system. In 1988, it received an upgrade providing limited capability against tactical ballistic missiles (TBM), designated PAC-1 (Patriot Advanced Capability 1). The most recent upgrade by manufacturer Lockheed Martin, designated PAC-3, is a nearly total system redesign of the interceptor missiles, this time designed from the outset with the capability to engage and destroy tactical ballistic missiles. The Army plans to upgrade the Patriot system as part of the Integrated Air and Missile Defense system which will be designed to tie into a broader air defense architecture using an Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS).

===Patriot equipment===

The Patriot system has four major operational functions: communications, command and control, radar surveillance, and missile guidance. The four functions combine to provide a coordinated, secure, integrated, mobile air defense system.

The Patriot system is modular and highly mobile. A battery-sized element can be installed in less than an hour. All components, consisting of the fire control section (radar set, engagement control station, antenna mast group, electric power plant) and launchers, are truck- or trailer-mounted. The radar set and launchers (with missiles) are mounted on M860 semi-trailers, which are towed by Oshkosh M983 HEMTTs.
Missile reloading is accomplished using a M985 HEMTT truck with a Hiab crane on the back. This crane is larger than the standard Grove cranes found on regular M977 HEMTT and M985 HEMTT cargo body trucks. The crane truck, known as a Guided Missile Transporter (GMT), removes spent missile canisters from the launcher and replaces them with fresh missiles. Because the crane nearly doubles the height of the HEMTT when not stowed, crews informally refer to it as the &quot;scorpion tail&quot;. A standard M977 HEMTT with a regular-sized crane is sometimes referred to as the Large Repair Parts Transporter (LRPT).

The heart of the Patriot battery is the fire control section, consisting of the AN/MPQ-53 or −65/65A Radar Set (RS), the AN/MSQ-104 or −132 Engagement Control Station (ECS), the OE-349 Antenna Mast Group (AMG), and the EPP-III Electric Power Plant (EPP). The system&#x27;s missiles are transported on and launched from either the M901 Launching Station (LS), which can carry up to four PAC-2 missiles; the M902 LS, with sixteen PAC-3 missiles; or the M903 LS, which can be configured to carry PAC-2, PAC-3, and MSE/SkyCeptor missiles in various combinations. A Patriot battalion is also equipped with the Information Coordination Central (ICC), a command station designed to coordinate the launches of a battalion and uplink Patriot to the JTIDS or MIDS network.

====AN/MPQ-53, -65 and -65A Radar Set====
The AN/MPQ-53/65 Radar Set is a passive electronically scanned array radar equipped with IFF, electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM), and track-via-missile (TVM) guidance subsystems.
The AN/MPQ-53 Radar Set supports PAC-2 units, while the AN/MPQ-65 Radar Set supports PAC-2 and PAC-3 units. The main difference between these two radars is the addition of a second travelling-wave tube (TWT), which gives the −65 radar increased search, detection, and tracking capability. The radar antenna array consists of over 5,000 elements that &quot;deflect&quot; the radar beam many times per second.

The radar antenna array contains an IFF interrogator subsystem, a TVM array, and at least one &quot;sidelobe canceller&quot; (SLC), which is a small array designed to decrease interference that might affect the radar. Patriot&#x27;s radar is somewhat unusual in that it is a &quot;detection-to-kill&quot; system, meaning that a single unit performs all search, identification, track, and engagement functions. Most other SAM systems, by contrast, require several different radars to perform all functions necessary to detect and engage targets.
The beam created by the Patriot&#x27;s flat phased array radar is comparatively narrow and highly agile compared to that of a moving dish. This characteristic gives the radar the ability to detect small, fast targets like ballistic missiles, or low radar cross-section targets such as stealth aircraft or cruise missiles. The power and agility of Patriot&#x27;s radar is also highly resistant to countermeasures, including ECM, radar jamming, and use of RWR equipment. Patriot is capable of quickly changing frequencies to resist jamming. However, the radar can suffer from &quot;blind spots.&quot;
The Army is planning upgrades to the Patriot system&#x27;s radar components, including a new digital processor that replaces the one used since the system&#x27;s introduction. In 2017, the Patriot got a new AN/MPQ-65A active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar that has greater range and sharper discrimination. The main gallium nitride (GaN)-based AESA array measures , is a bolt-on replacement for the current antenna, and is oriented toward the primary threat; two new rear panel arrays are a quarter the size of the main array and let the system look behind and to the sides, providing 360-degree coverage. The GaN AESA radar also has up to 50 percent less maintenance costs. Instead of shining a single transmitter through many lenses, the GaN array uses many smaller transmitters, each with its own control, increasing flexibility and allowing it to work even if some transmitters do not.

In October 2017, the Army announced Raytheon&#x27;s Lower-Tier Air and Missile Defense System (LTAMDS) radar had been selected as the Patriot system&#x27;s new radar. Unlike the previous radar which could only watch one part of the sky at a time primarily to detect ballistic missiles, the LTAMDS has 360-degree coverage to detect low flying and maneuvering drones and cruise missiles. The design has one large main array flanked by two smaller arrays, with the main panel still focused on high-altitude threats and the side panels, which are half the size with twice the power of the previous radar set, able to detect slower threats from considerable distance. Raytheon was awarded a million contract to build the first six radars to enter service in 2022.

====AN/MSQ-104 and -132 Engagement Control Station====
The AN/MSQ-104 or AN/MSQ-132 Engagement Control Station (ECS) is the nerve center of the Patriot firing battery, costing approximately million per unit. The ECS consists of a shelter mounted on the bed of an M927 5-Ton Cargo Truck or on the bed of a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle (LMTV) cargo truck. The main subcomponents of the ECS are the Weapons Control Computer (WCC), the Data Link Terminal (DLT), the UHF communications array, the Routing Logic Radio Interface Unit (RLRIU), and the two-person stations that serve as the system&#x27;s human machine interface. The ECS is air conditioned, pressurized (to resist chemical/biological attack), and shielded against electromagnetic pulse (EMP) or other such electromagnetic interference. The ECS also contains several SINCGARS radios to facilitate voice communications.

The WCC is the main computer within the Patriot system. This computer controls the operator interface, calculates missile intercept algorithms, and provides limited fault diagnostics. It was designed as a 24-bit parallel militarized computer with fixed- and floating-point capability, organized in a multiprocessor configuration that operates at a maximum clock rate of . Compared to modern personal computers, this represents very limited processing power, so the computer has been upgraded several times during Patriot&#x27;s service life. The latest variant fielded in 2013 has performance improved by several orders of magnitude.

The DLT connects the ECS to Patriot&#x27;s Launching Stations. It uses either a SINCGARS radio or fiber optic cables to transmit encrypted data between the ECS and the launchers. Through the DLT, the system operators can remotely emplace, slew or stow launchers, perform diagnostics on launchers or missiles, and fire missiles.

The UHF communications array consists of three UHF radio &quot;stacks&quot; and their associated patching and encrypting equipment. These radios are connected to the antennas of the OE-349 Antenna Mast Group, which are used to create UHF &quot;shots&quot; between sister Patriot batteries and their associated ICC. This creates a secure, real-time data network (known as PADIL, Patriot Data Information Link) that allows the ICC to centralize control of its subordinate firing batteries.

The RLRIU functions as the primary router for all data coming into the ECS. The RLRIU gives a firing battery an address on the battalion data network, and sends/receives data from across the battalion. It also &quot;translates&quot; data coming from the WCC to the DLT, facilitating communication with the launchers.

Patriot&#x27;s crew stations are referred to as Manstation 1 and 3 (MS1 and MS3). These are the stations where Patriot operators interface with the system. The manstations consist of a monochrome (green and black) screen surrounded by various Switch Indicators. Each manstation also has a traditional QWERTY keyboard and isometric stick, a tiny joystick that functions much like a PC mouse. It is through these switch indicators and the Patriot user interface software that the system is operated. With newer upgrades, the operator&#x27;s monochrome screen and physical switches have been replaced with two touchscreen LCDs and a standard keyboard/mouse at both stations.

====OE-349 Antenna Mast Group====

The OE-349 Antenna Mast Group (AMG) is mounted on an M927 5-Ton Cargo Truck. It includes four 4 kW antennas in two pairs on remotely controlled masts. Emplacement of the AMG can have no greater than a 0.5-degree roll and a 10-degree crossroll. The antennas can be controlled in azimuth, and the masts can be elevated up to above ground level. Mounted at the base of each pair of antennas are two high-power amplifiers associated with the antennas and the radios in the co-located shelter.

It is through these antennas that the ECS and ICC send their respective UHF &quot;shots&quot; to create the PADIL network. The polarity of each shot can be changed by adjusting the &quot;feedhorn&quot; to a vertical or horizontal position. This enables a greater chance of communication shots reaching their intended target when terrain obstacles may otherwise obscure the signal.

====EPP-III Electric Power Plant====

The EPP-III Diesel-Electric Power Plant (EPP) is the power source for the ECS and Radar. The EPP consists of two 150 kilowatt diesel engines with 400 hertz, 3-phase generators that are interconnected through the power distribution unit. The generators are mounted on a trailer or modified M977 HEMTT. Each EPP has two fuel tanks and a fuel distribution assembly with grounding equipment. Each diesel engine can operate for more than eight hours with a full fuel tank. The EPP delivers its power to the Radar and ECS through cables stored in reels alongside the generators. It powers the AMG via a cable routed through the ECS.

====M901/902/903 Launching Station====

The M90x Launching Stations are remotely operated, self-contained units. The ECS controls operation of the launchers through each launcher&#x27;s DLT, via fiber optic or VHF (SINCGARS) data link.

Integral levelling equipment permits emplacement on slopes of up to 10 degrees. Each launcher is trainable in azimuth and elevates to a fixed, elevated launch position. Precise aiming of the launcher before launch is not necessary; thus, no extra lags are introduced into system reaction time. Each launcher is capable of providing detailed diagnostics to the ECS via the data link.

The launching station contains four major equipment subsystems: the launcher generator set, the launcher electronics module (LEM), the launcher mechanics assembly (LMA), and the launcher interconnection group (LIG). The generator set consists of a 15 kW, 400 Hz generator that powers the launcher. The LEM is used for the real-time implementation of launcher operations requested via data link from the ECS. The LMA physically erects and rotates the launcher&#x27;s platform and its missiles. The LIG connects the missiles themselves to the launcher via the Launcher Missile Round Distributor (LMRD).

====Patriot guided missile====
The first fielded variant was the MIM-104A &quot;Standard&quot;. It was optimized solely for engagements against aircraft and had very limited capability against ballistic missiles. It had a range of , and a speed in excess of Mach 2. The MIM-104B &quot;anti-standoff jammer&quot; (ASOJ) is a missile designed to seek out and destroy ECM emitters.

The MIM-104C PAC-2 missile was the first Patriot missile that was optimized for ballistic missile engagements. The GEM series of missiles (MIM-104D/E) are further refinements of the PAC-2 missile. The PAC-3 missile is a new interceptor, featuring a Ka band active radar seeker, employing &quot;hit-to-kill&quot; interception, in contrast to previous interceptors&#x27; method of exploding in the vicinity of the target, destroying it with shrapnel, and several other enhancements which dramatically increase its lethality against ballistic missiles. The specific information for these different kinds of missiles are discussed in the &quot;Variants&quot; section.

The first seven of these are in the larger PAC-2 configuration of a single missile per canister, of which four can be placed on a launcher. PAC-3 missile canisters contain four missiles, so that sixteen rounds can be placed on a launcher. The missile canister serves as both the shipping and storage container and the launch tube. Patriot missiles are referred to as &quot;certified rounds&quot; as they leave the factory, and additional maintenance is not necessary on the missile prior to it being launched.

The PAC-2 missile is long, weighs about , and is propelled by a solid-fueled rocket motor.

====Patriot missile design====
The PAC-2 family of missiles all have a fairly standard design, the only differences between the variants being certain internal components. They consist of (from front to rear) the radome, guidance section, warhead section, propulsion section, and control actuator section.

The radome is made of slip cast fused silica approximately thick, with a nickel alloy tip, and a composite base attachment ring bonded to the slip cast fused silica and protected by a molded silicone rubber ring. The radome provides an aerodynamic shape for the missile and microwave window and thermal protection for the RF seeker and electronic components.

The Patriot guidance section consists primarily of the modular digital airborne guidance system (MDAGS). The MDAGS consists of a modular midcourse package that performs all of the required guidance functions from launch through midcourse and a terminal guidance section. The TVM seeker is mounted on the guidance section, extending into the radome.
The seeker consists of an antenna mounted on an inertial platform, antenna control electronics, a receiver, and a transmitter. The Modular Midcourse Package (MMP), which is located in the forward portion of the warhead section, consists of the navigational electronics and a missile-borne computer that computes the guidance and autopilot algorithms and provides steering commands according to a resident computer program.

The warhead section, just aft of the guidance section, contains the proximity fuzed warhead, safety-and-arming device, fuzing circuits and antennas, link antenna switching circuits, auxiliary electronics, inertial sensor assembly, and signal data converter.

The propulsion section consists of the rocket motor, external heat shield, and two external conduits. The rocket motor includes the case, nozzle assembly, propellant, liner and insulation, pyrogen igniter, and propulsion arming and firing unit. The casing of the motor is an integral structural element of the missile airframe. It contains a conventional, casebonded solid rocket propellant.

The Control Actuator Section (CAS) is at the aft end of the missile. It receives commands from the missile autopilot and positions the fins. The missile fins steer and stabilize the missile in flight. A fin servo system positions the fins. The fin servo system consists of hydraulic actuators and valves and an electrohydraulic power supply. The electrohydraulic power consists of a battery, motor pump, oil reservoir, gas pressure bottle, and accumulator.

==Variants==
===MIM-104A===
Patriot was first introduced with a single missile type: the MIM-104A. This was the initial &quot;Standard&quot; missile, still known as &quot;Standard&quot; today. In Patriot&#x27;s early days, the system was used exclusively as an anti-aircraft weapon, with no capability against ballistic missiles. This was remedied during the late 1980s when Patriot received its first major system overhaul with the introduction of the Patriot Advanced Capability missile and concurrent system upgrades.

=== MIM-104B (PAC-1)===
Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-1), known today as the PAC-1 upgrade, was a software-only upgrade. The most significant aspects of this upgrade were changing the way the radar searched and the way the system defended its assets. Instead of searching low to the horizon, the top of the radar&#x27;s search angle was lifted to near vertical (89 degrees) from the previous angle of 25 degrees. This was done as a counter to the steep parabolic trajectory of inbound ballistic missiles. The search beams of the radar were tightened, and while in &quot;TBM search mode&quot; the &quot;flash,&quot; or the speed at which these beams were shot out, was increased significantly.

While this increased the radar&#x27;s detection capability against the ballistic missile threat set, it decreased the system&#x27;s effectiveness against traditional atmospheric targets, as it reduced the detection range of the radar as well as the number of &quot;flashes&quot; at the horizon. Because of this, it was necessary to retain the search functions for traditional atmospheric threats in a separate search program, which could be easily toggled by the operator based on the expected threat.

The ballistic missile defense capability changed the way Patriot defended targets. Instead of being used as a system to defend a significant area against enemy air attack, it was now used to defend much smaller &quot;point&quot; targets, which needed to lie within the system&#x27;s TBM &quot;footprint&quot;. The footprint is the area on the ground that Patriot can defend against inbound ballistic missiles.

During the 1980s, Patriot was upgraded in relatively minor ways, mostly via its software. The most significant of these was a special upgrade to discriminate and intercept artillery rockets in the vein of the multiple rocket launcher, which was seen as a significant threat from North Korea. This feature has not been used in combat and has since been deleted from U.S. Army Patriot systems, though it remains in South Korean systems. Another upgrade the system saw was the introduction of another missile type, designated MIM-104B and called &quot;anti stand-off jammer&quot; (ASOJ) by the Army. This variant is designed to help Patriot engage and destroy ECM aircraft at standoff ranges. It works similar to an anti-radiation missile in that it flies a highly lofted trajectory and then locates, homes in on, and destroys the most significant emitter in an area designated by the operator.

=== MIM-104C (PAC-2)===
During the late 1980s, tests began to indicate that, although Patriot was certainly capable of intercepting inbound ballistic missiles, it was questionable whether the MIM-104A/B missile was capable of destroying them reliably. This necessitated the introduction of the PAC-2 missile and system upgrade.

For the system, the PAC-2 upgrade was similar to the PAC-1 upgrade. Radar search algorithms were further optimized, and the beam protocol while in &quot;TBM search&quot; was further modified. PAC-2 saw Patriot&#x27;s first major missile upgrade, with the introduction of the MIM-104C, or PAC-2 missile. This missile was optimized for ballistic missile engagements. Major changes to the PAC-2 missile were the size of the projectiles in its blast-fragmentation warhead, changed from around 2 grams to around 45 grams, and the timing of the pulse-Doppler radar fuze, which was optimized for high-speed engagements, though it retained its old algorithm for aircraft engagements if necessary.

Engagement procedures were optimized, changing the method of fire the system used to engage ballistic missiles. Instead of launching two missiles in an almost simultaneous salvo, a brief delay between 3 and 4 seconds was added, in order to allow the second missile launched to discriminate a ballistic missile warhead in the aftermath of the explosion of the first.

PAC-2 was first tested in 1987 and reached Army units in 1990, just in time for deployment to the Middle East for the Persian Gulf War. It was there that Patriot was first regarded as a successful ABM system and proof that ballistic missile defense was indeed possible. The complete study on its effectiveness remains classified.

In April 2013, Raytheon received U.S. Army approval for a second recertification, extending the operational life of the worldwide inventory of Patriot missiles from 30 to 45 years.

=== MIM-104D (PAC-2/GEM)===
There were more upgrades to PAC-2 systems throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, mostly centering on software. The PAC-2 missiles were modified significantly—four separate variants became known collectively as guidance enhanced missiles (GEM).

The main upgrade to the original GEM missile was a new, faster proximity fuzed warhead. Tests had indicated that the fuze on the original PAC-2 missiles were detonating their warheads too late when engaging ballistic missiles with an extremely steep ingress, and as such it was necessary to shorten this fuze delay. The GEM missile was given a new &quot;low noise&quot; seeker head designed to reduce interference in front of the missile&#x27;s radar seeker, and a higher performance seeker designed to better detect low radar cross-section targets. The GEM was used extensively in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), during which air defense was highly successful.

=== MIM-104E (PAC-2/GEM+)===
Just prior to OIF, it was decided to further upgrade the GEM and PAC-2 missiles. This upgrade program produced missiles known as the GEM-T and the GEM-C, the &quot;T&quot; designator referring to tactical ballistic missiles, and the &quot;C&quot; designator referring to cruise missiles. These missiles were both given a totally new nose section, which was designed specifically to be more effective against low altitude, low RCS targets like cruise missiles. The GEM-T was given a new fuze which was further optimized against ballistic missiles and a new low noise oscillator which increases the seeker&#x27;s sensitivity to low radar cross-section targets. The GEM-C is the upgraded version of the GEM, and the GEM-T is the upgraded version of the PAC-2. The GEM+ entered service in November 2002.

In 2018, Raytheon upgraded the GEM-T guidance system with solid-state gallium nitride (GaN) transmitters. A consortium of Patriot operators consisting of Germany, Romania, Spain, and the Netherlands has placed an order for 1,000 PAC-2 GEM-T missiles, with the bulk of production to take place in Germany by MBDA. Domestic U.S. production of PAC-2 GEM-T missiles remains ongoing, with a contracted backlog of approximately 1,500 missiles and a near-term demand of an additional 1,000 missiles, while the company is producing roughly 20 missiles a month with plans to expand to 35 missiles a month by the end of 2027.

=== MIM-104F (PAC-3)===
The PAC-3 upgrade is a significant upgrade to nearly every aspect of the system. It took place in three stages deployed in 1995, 1996 and 2000, and units were designated Configuration 1, 2, or 3.

New software update known as PDB 5 (PDB standing for &quot;post deployment build&quot;) was released in 1999 with initial support for Configuration-3 ground units and PAC-3 missiles. The system itself saw another upgrade of its WCC, and the communication setup was given a complete overhaul. Due to this upgrade, PAC-3 operators can now see, transmit, and receive tracks on the Link 16 Command and Control (C2) network using a Class 2M Terminal or MIDS LVT Radio. This capability greatly increases the situational awareness of Patriot crews and other participants on the Link 16 network that are able to receive the Patriot local air picture.

The software can now conduct a tailored TBM search, optimizing radar resources for search in a particular sector known to have ballistic missile activity, and can support a &quot;keepout altitude&quot; to ensure ballistic missiles with chemical warheads or early release submunitions (ERS) are destroyed at a certain altitude. For Configuration 3 units, the Patriot radar was completely redesigned, adding another traveling wave tube (TWT) that increased the radar&#x27;s search, detection, tracking, and discrimination abilities. The new radar is designated AN/MPQ-65. It is capable, among other things, of discriminating whether an aircraft is crewed and which of multiple reentering ballistic objects are carrying ordnance.
The PAC-3 upgrade carried with it a new missile design, nominally known as MIM-104F and called PAC-3 by the Army. First deployed in 1997, the PAC-3 missile evolved from the Strategic Defense Initiative&#x27;s ERINT missile, and so it is dedicated almost entirely to the anti-ballistic missile mission. Due to miniaturization, a single canister can hold four PAC-3 missiles, as opposed to one PAC-2 missile per canister. The PAC-3 missile is more maneuverable than previous variants, due to 180 tiny pulse solid propellant rocket motors mounted in the forebody of the missile, called Attitude Control Motors, or ACMs, which serve to fine align the missile trajectory with its target to achieve hit-to-kill capability.
The most significant upgrade to the PAC-3 missile is the addition of a Ka band active radar seeker. This allows the missile to drop its uplink to the system and acquire its target itself in the terminal phase of its intercept, which improves the reaction time of the missile against a fast-moving ballistic missile target. The PAC-3 missile is accurate enough to select, target, and home in on the warhead portion of an inbound ballistic missile. The active radar gives the warhead a &quot;hit-to-kill&quot; (kinetic kill vehicle) capability that eliminates the need for a traditional proximity-fused warhead. The missile still has a small explosive warhead, called a &quot;lethality enhancer&quot;, a warhead which launches 24 low-speed tungsten fragments in a radial direction to make the missile cross-section greater and enhance the kill probability. This greatly increases the lethality against ballistic missiles of all types.

The PAC-3 upgrade has effectively quintupled the &quot;footprint&quot; that a Patriot unit can defend against ballistic missiles of all types, and has considerably increased the system&#x27;s lethality and effectiveness against ballistic missiles. It has increased the scope of ballistic missiles that Patriot can engage, which now includes several intermediate ranges. However, despite its increases in ballistic missile defense capabilities, the PAC-3 missile has a shorter range and a smaller explosive warhead compared to older Patriot missiles, making it a less capable interceptor of atmospheric aircraft and air-to-surface missiles. During initial production run, range was increased and other cost-reducing enhancements were incorporated to the PAC-3 missile, with the final variant renamed PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI).

Since the PAC-3 ground units can control both M901 PAC-2 launchers and M902/M903 PAC-2/PAC-3 launchers, Patriot batteries employ a mix of PAC-3 hit-to-kill active missiles and PAC-2 GEM-T blast fragmentation warhead semi-active missiles to counter both ballistic missile and aircraft threats. While the PAC-2 is able to intercept targets up to an altitude of , the PAC-3 can destroy incoming missiles at an altitude of .

Lockheed Martin proposed an air-launched variant of the PAC-3 missile for use on the F-15C Eagle, the F-22 Raptor and the P-8A Poseidon.

===PAC-3 MSE===

Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control is the prime contractor on the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement upgrade (MSE) to the Patriot air defense system which will make the missile more agile and extend its range by up to 50%.
Patriot&#x27;s PAC-3 MSE interceptor was selected as the primary interceptor for the new MEADS system when its design and development program began in 2004. MEADS is designed with plug-and-fight capabilities to support data exchange with external sensors and launchers through standardized open protocols for integrated air and missile defense (IAMD), so that MEADS elements can interoperate with allied forces on the move, attaching to and detaching from the battle management network as necessary. MEADS was scheduled to enter service alongside Patriot by 2014, with expectations that existing Patriot batteries will be gradually upgraded with MEADS technology in the long run. Because of economic conditions, in 2013 the U.S. chose to upgrade its Patriot systems instead of buying the MEADS system.
The PAC-3 Missile Segment upgrade consists of the PAC-3 MSE missile, a very agile hit-to-kill interceptor, the M903 Launching Station, a fire solution computer, and an Enhanced Launcher Electronics System (ELES). The PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor increases altitude and range through a more powerful dual-pulse motor for added thrust, larger fins that collapse inside current launchers, and other structural modifications for more agility. The PAC-3 MSE is capable of intercepting longer-range theater ballistic missiles. The U.S. Army accepted the first PAC-3 MSE interceptors in October 2015, and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was declared in August 2016.

The new M903 Launching System has a modular design capable of holding a total of 4 PAC-3 launching canisters (16 missiles), 12 PAC-3 MSE canisters (in 3 rows of 4), or 4 PAC-2 GEM canisters. It can mix different missiles, such as 6 PAC-3 MSE canisters (in 3 rows of 2) and either two PAC-3 canisters (8 missiles) or two PAC-2 canisters on the same launcher, down to combinations of a single PAC-2 canister, a single PAC-3 canister (4 missiles), 4 PAC-3 MSE canisters (in 2 rows of 2) or 2 PAC-3 MSE canisters in a single row. In December 2023 it was stated that production of Patriot interceptors was 550 a year and would be increased to 650 a year in 2024.

In February 2023, Lockheed Martin showcased integration of PAC-3 MSE missile with Mk 41 VLS used by Aegis BMD and Aegis Ashore. Lockheed announced it is spending $100 million to integrate the missile with the Aegis combat system and plans to test whether it can fire the missiles from a vertical launch system tied into Aegis’s command-and-control technology and the SPY-1 radar in early 2024. In 2024, it was integrated with Aegis and launched from a Mark 70 Payload Delivery System VLS launcher at White Sands Missile Range.

=== SkyCeptor (PAAC-4)===

In August 2013, Raytheon and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems announced plans for Patriot Advanced Affordable Capability-4 (PAAC-4), which would integrate the Stunner interceptor from the jointly-funded David&#x27;s Sling program with Patriot PAC-3 radars, launchers, and engagement control stations. The two-stage, multimode seeking Stunner would replace single-stage, radar-guided PAC-3 missiles produced by Lockheed Martin, providing improved operational performance at 20 percent of the $2 million unit cost of PAC-3 missiles. Israeli program officials have said that a previous teaming agreement between Raytheon and Rafael would allow the U.S. company to assume prime contractor status, and produce at least 60 percent of the Stunner missile in the United States.

In 2016 Raytheon announced that it had been authorized to bid SkyCeptor, a Stunner derivative, as part of its Polish Patriot bid. In March 2017 it was announced that Poland will acquire 8 Patriot batteries, with the majority of missiles deployed being SkyCeptors and only a small number of Patriot PAC-3 MSE missiles. Ultimately, Poland did not procure SkyCeptor missiles, ordering a new short-range air defence system based on CAMM and CAMM-ER missiles, integrated with Patriot batteries through the IBCS battle command system.

Electromecanica Ploiești, Romania, will start local production of SkyCeptor missile interceptors by 2026.

===Upgrades===
PAC-3 system upgrades continue under the International Engineering Services Program (IESP) which includes all countries that rely on the Patriot for integrated air and missile defense - as of 2022, the United States of America, The Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Bahrain, and Switzerland.

The PDB 6 software update was released in 2004. This update allowed Configuration-3 to discriminate targets of all types, including anti-radiation missile carriers, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cruise missiles.

The PDB 7 system upgrade was released in 2013. It improves radar search capabilities with a transition to digital signal processing, resulting in much better reliability and 30% longer range comparing to analog circuits. Processing power of the new command and control computer is higher by several orders of magnitude. Operator&#x27;s monochrome CRT displays with hard-wired buttons were replaced by two color touchscreen LCD monitors.
The PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) upgrade was fielded in 2015. It includes a new fin design and a more powerful rocket engine.

In 2017, the AN/MPQ-65 radar was upgraded with active electronically scanned array (AESA) solid-state gallium nitride (GaN) transmitters in place of conventional traveling-wave tubes with a passive array of transmitters. The new radar has been redesignated AN/MPQ-65A. It includes a bolt-on replacement antenna array and two smaller rear panel arrays which provide 360-degree coverage.

During 2018–2023, Raytheon Company will further enhance the system under a modernization task order from the United States Army, resulting in Configuration-3+. The order includes five annual, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity task order awards with a total contract ceiling of more than $2.3 billion, funded by Patriot partner states. The initial $235 million award was allocated in January 2018.

The PDB 8 upgrade released in 2018 includes redesigned fire control computers which support MSE capabilities, new weapons control computers with increased processing power, and software enhancements to radar search and target detection and identification which help reduce friendly fire incidents. The latest PDB 8.1 software started testing in 2019 and will reach operational status by 2023. It adds a revamped game-style GUI named &quot;Warfighter to Machine Interface&quot; (WMI) which employs 3D graphics to render the terrain and the airspace.

Future upgrades to the Patriot system will include the new Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor or LTAMDS with support for a Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) - which will integrate Patriot&#x27;s LTAMDS, AN/MPQ-53 and AN/MPQ-65/65A radars with AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel and AN/TPS-80 G/ATOR, GhostEye MR (NASAMS), MFCR and SR from MEADS, AN/SPY-1 and AN/SPY-6 (Aegis BMD), AN/TPY-2 (THAAD and GMD) and AN/APG-81 (F-35 Lightning II) radars - and Mode 5 transponder interrogation in the identification friend or foe system. On February 7, 2025, Raytheon&#x27;s LTAMDS radar successfully completed a live-fire test, detecting and tracking a high-speed cruise missile and guiding a PAC-2 GEM-T interceptor to neutralize the threat. As part of an ongoing U.S. Army test program, LTAMDS continues advancing toward full deployment, with strong international interest and a $2 billion contract to supply radars to the U.S. and Poland.

==Patriot battalion==
In the U.S. Army, the Patriot System is designed around the battalion echelon. A Patriot battalion consists of a headquarters battery, which includes the Patriot ICC and its operators, a maintenance company, and between four and six &quot;line batteries,&quot; which are the actual launching batteries that employ the Patriot systems. Each line battery consists of (nominally) six launchers and three or four platoons: Fire Control platoon, Launcher platoon, and a Headquarters/Maintenance platoon - either a single platoon or separated into two separate units, at the battery commander&#x27;s discretion.

The Fire Control platoon is responsible for operating and maintaining the &quot;big 4,&quot; radar, the engagement control station, the antenna mast group, and the electric power plant. The launcher platoon operates and maintains the launchers. The Headquarters/Maintenance platoon(s) provide the battery with maintenance support and a headquarters section. The Patriot line battery is commanded by a captain and usually consists of between 70 and 90 soldiers. The Patriot battalion is commanded by a lieutenant colonel and can include as many as 600 soldiers.

Once deployed, the system requires a crew of only three individuals to operate. The Tactical Control Officer (TCO), usually a lieutenant, is responsible for the operation of the system. The TCO is assisted by the Tactical Control Assistant (TCA). Communications are handled by the third crewmember, the communications system specialist. A &quot;hot-crew&quot; composed of an NCOIC (usually a Sergeant) and one or more additional launcher crew members is on-hand to repair or refuel launching stations. A reload crew is on standby to replace spent canisters after missiles are launched. The ICC crew is similar to the ECS crew at the battery level, except its operators are designated as the Tactical Director (TD) and the Tactical Director Assistant (TDA).

Patriot battalions prefer to operate in a centralized fashion, with the ICC controlling the launches of all of its subordinate launching batteries through the secure UHF PADIL communications network.
The dismounted Patriot ICC (D-PICC) is a set of equipment which is composed of the same hardware as that at battalion level, but which distributes command and control over the launching batteries, which allows the batteries to disperse over a wider geographic area, with no loss of command and control. D-PICC is deploying to Pacific Command first.

U.S. Army Patriot battalions have been heavily deployed, and for years maintained the highest operational tempo across any units in the service with the longest deployments.

===Operation===
==== Engaging a single aircraft ====
Following is the process a PAC-2 firing battery uses to engage a single target (an aircraft) with a single missile:

# A hostile aircraft is detected by the AN/MPQ-65 Radar. The radar examines the track&#x27;s size, speed, altitude, and heading, and decides whether or not it is a legitimate track or &quot;clutter&quot; created by RF interference.
# If the track is classified by the radar as an aircraft, in the AN/MSQ-104 Engagement Control Station, an unidentified track appears on the screen of the Patriot operators. The operators examine the speed, altitude and heading of the track. Additionally, the IFF subsystem &quot;pings&quot; the track to determine if it has any IFF response.
# Based on many factors, including the track&#x27;s speed, altitude, heading, IFF response, or its presence in &quot;safe passage corridors&quot; or &quot;missile engagement zones,&quot; the ECS operator, the TCO (tactical control officer), makes an ID recommendation to the ICC operator, the TD (tactical director).
# The TD examines the track and decides to certify that it is hostile. Typically, the engagement authority for Patriot units rests with the Regional or Sector Air Defense Commander (RADC/SADC), who will be located either on a U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser or on a USAF AWACS aircraft. A Patriot operator (called the &quot;ADAFCO&quot; or Air Defense Artillery Fire Control Officer) is colocated with the RADC/SADC to facilitate communication to the Patriot battalions.
# The TD contacts the ADAFCO and correlates the track, ensuring that it is not a friendly aircraft.
# The ADAFCO obtains the engagement command from RADC/SADC, and delegates the engagement back down to the Patriot battalion.
# Once the engagement command is received, the TD selects a firing battery to take the shot and orders them to engage.
# The TCO instructs the TCA to engage the track. The TCA brings the system&#x27;s launchers from &quot;standby&quot; into &quot;operate&quot;.
# The TCA presses the &quot;engage&quot; switch indicator. This sends a signal to the selected launcher and fires a missile selected automatically by the system.
# The AN/MPQ-65 Radar, which has been continuously tracking the hostile aircraft, &quot;acquires&quot; the just-fired missile and begins feeding it interception data. The Radar also &quot;illuminates&quot; the target for the missile&#x27;s semi-active radar seeker.
# The monopulse receiver in the missile&#x27;s nose receives the reflection of illumination energy from the target. The track-via-missile uplink sends this data through an antenna in the missile&#x27;s tail back to the AN/MPQ-65 set. In the ECS, computers calculate the maneuvers that the missile should perform in order to maintain a trajectory to the target and the TVM uplink sends these to the missile.
# Once in the vicinity of the target, the missile detonates its proximity fused warhead.

==== Engaging a ballistic missile ====
Following is the process a PAC-3 firing battery uses to engage a single tactical ballistic missile with two PAC-3 missiles:

# A missile is detected by the AN/MPQ-65 radar. The radar reviews the speed, altitude, behavior, and radar cross-section of the target. If this data lines up with the discrimination parameters set into the system, the missile is presented on the screen of the operator as a ballistic missile target.
# In the AN/MSQ-104 Engagement Control Station, the TCO reviews the speed, altitude, and trajectory of the track and then authorizes engagement. Upon authorizing engagement, the TCO instructs his TCA to bring the system&#x27;s launchers into &quot;operate&quot; mode from &quot;standby&quot; mode. The engagement will take place automatically at the moment the computer defines the parameters that ensure the highest probability of kill.
# The system computer determines which of the battery&#x27;s launchers have the highest probability of kill and selects them to fire. Two missiles are launched 4.2 seconds apart in a &quot;ripple&quot;.
# The AN/MPQ-65 radar continues tracking the target and uploads intercept information to the PAC-3 missiles which are now outbound to intercept.
# Upon reaching its terminal homing phase, the Ka band active radar seeker in the nose of the PAC-3 missile acquires the inbound ballistic missile. This radar selects the radar return most likely to be the warhead of the incoming missile and directs the interceptor towards it.
# The ACMs (attitude control motors) of the PAC-3 missile fire to precisely align the missile on the interception trajectory.
# The interceptor flies straight through the warhead of the inbound ballistic missile, detonating it and destroying the missile.
# The second missile locates any debris which may be a warhead and attacks in a similar manner.

==Operational history==
===Persian Gulf War (1991)===

====Trial by fire====
Prior to the First Gulf War, ballistic missile defense was an unproven concept in war. During Operation Desert Storm, in addition to its anti-aircraft mission, the Patriot was assigned to shoot down incoming Iraqi Scud or Al Hussein short range ballistic missiles launched at Israel and Saudi Arabia. The first combat use of Patriot occurred January 18, 1991, when it engaged what was later found to be a computer glitch. There were actually no Scuds fired at Saudi Arabia on January 18. This incident was widely misreported as the first successful interception of an enemy ballistic missile in history.

Throughout the war, Patriot missiles attempted engagement of over 40 hostile ballistic missiles. The success of these engagements, and in particular how many of them were real targets, is still controversial. Postwar video analysis of presumed interceptions by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor Theodore Postol suggests that no Scud was actually hit. This analysis is contested by Peter D. Zimmerman, who claimed that photographs of the fuselage of downed Scud missiles in Saudi Arabia demonstrated that the Scud missiles were fired into Saudi Arabia and were riddled with fragments from the lethality enhancer of Patriot Missiles.

====Failure at Dhahran====
On February 25, 1991, an Iraqi Al Hussein Scud missile hit the barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 soldiers from the U.S. Army&#x27;s 14th Quartermaster Detachment.

A government investigation revealed that the failed intercept at Dhahran had been caused by a software error in the system&#x27;s handling of timestamps. The Patriot missile battery at Dhahran had been in operation for 100 hours, by which time the system&#x27;s internal clock had drifted by one-third of a second. Due to the missile&#x27;s speed this was equivalent to a miss distance of 600 meters.

The radar system had successfully detected the Scud and predicted where to look for it next. However, the timestamps of the two radar pulses being compared were converted to floating point differently: one correctly, the other introducing an error proportionate to the operation time so far (100 hours) caused by the truncation in a 24-bit fixed-point register. As a result, the difference between the pulses was wrong, so the system looked in the wrong part of the sky and found no target. With no target, the initial detection was assumed to be a spurious track and the missile was removed from the system. No interception was attempted, and the Scud impacted on a makeshift barracks in an Al Khobar warehouse, killing 28 soldiers, the first Americans to be killed from the Scuds that Iraq had launched against Saudi Arabia and Israel.

Two weeks earlier, on February 11, 1991, the Israelis had identified the problem and informed the U.S. Army and the PATRIOT Project Office, the software manufacturer. As a stopgap measure, the Israelis had recommended rebooting the system&#x27;s computers regularly. The manufacturer supplied updated software to the Army on February 26.

There had previously been failures in the MIM-104 system at the Joint Defense Facility Nurrungar in Australia, which was charged with processing signals from satellite-based early launch detection systems.

====Success rate vs. accuracy====

On February 15, 1991, President George H. W. Bush traveled to Raytheon&#x27;s Patriot manufacturing plant in Andover, Massachusetts, during the Gulf War. He declared, the &quot;Patriot is 41 for 42: 42 Scuds engaged, 41 intercepted!&quot; The President&#x27;s claimed success rate was over 97% at that point in the war.

On April 7, 1992, Theodore Postol of MIT, and Reuven Pedatzur of Tel Aviv University testified before a House Committee stating that, according to their independent analysis of video tapes, the Patriot system had a success rate of below 10%, and perhaps even a zero success rate.

On April 7, 1992, Charles A. Zraket of Harvard Kennedy School and Peter Zimmerman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank funded by the United States government and Raytheon, testified about the calculation of success rates and accuracy in Israel and Saudi Arabia and discounted many of the statements and methodologies in Postol&#x27;s report. According to Zimmerman, it is important to note the difference in terms when analyzing the performance of the system during the war:
* Success rate – the percentage of Scuds destroyed or deflected to unpopulated areas
* Accuracy – the percentage of hits out of all the Patriots fired

In accordance with the standard firing doctrine, on average four Patriots were launched at each incoming Scud in Saudi Arabia an average of three Patriots were fired. The large number of missiles fired suggests low confidence in individual missiles and that a higher rate of successful interceptions was achieved through brute force. For example, if a Patriot has a 50% individual success rate, two missiles will intercept 75% of the time, and three will intercept 87.5% of the time. Only one has to hit for a successful interception, but this does not mean that the other missiles would not also have hit.

The Iraqi redesign of the Scuds also played a role. Iraq had redesigned its Scuds by removing weight from the warhead to increase speed and range, but the changes weakened the missile and made it unstable during flight, creating a tendency for the Scud to break up during its descent from near space. This presented a larger number of targets as it was unclear which piece contained the warhead.

According to the Zraket testimony, there was a lack of high quality photographic equipment necessary to record the interceptions of targets. Therefore, Patriot crews recorded each launch on standard-definition videotape, which was insufficient for detailed analysis. Damage assessment teams videotaped the Scud debris that was found on the ground. Crater analysis was then used to determine if the warhead was destroyed before the debris crashed or not. Part of the reason for the 30% improvement in success rate in Saudi Arabia compared to Israel is that the Patriot merely had to push the incoming Scud missiles away from military targets in the desert or disable the Scud&#x27;s warhead in order to avoid casualties, while in Israel the Scuds were aimed directly at cities and civilian populations.

The Saudi Government also censored any reporting of Scud damage by the Saudi press. The Israeli Government did not institute the same type of censorship. Patriot&#x27;s success rate in Israel was examined by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) who did not have a political reason to play up Patriot&#x27;s success rate. The IDF counted any Scud that exploded on the ground, regardless of whether or not it was diverted, as a failure for the Patriot. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army, which had many reasons to support a high success rate for Patriot, examined the performance of Patriot in Saudi Arabia.

Both testimonies state that part of the problems stem from its original design as an anti-aircraft system. Patriot was designed with proximity fused warheads, which are designed to explode immediately prior to hitting a target spraying shrapnel out in a fan in front of the missile, either destroying or disabling the target. These missiles were fired at the target&#x27;s center of mass. With aircraft this was fine, but considering the much higher speeds of tactical ballistic missiles, as well as the location of the warhead, usually in the nose, Patriot most often hit closer to the tail of the Scud due to the delay present in the proximity fused warhead, thus not destroying the missile&#x27;s warhead and allowing it to fall to earth.

In response to the testimonies and other evidence, the staff of the House Government Operations Subcommittee on Legislation and National Security reported, &quot;The Patriot missile system was not the spectacular success in the Persian Gulf War that the American public was led to believe. There is little evidence to prove that the Patriot hit more than a few Scud missiles launched by Iraq during the Gulf War, and there are some doubts about even these engagements. The public and the United States Congress were misled by definitive statements of success issued by administration and Raytheon representatives during and after the war.&quot;

A Canadian &quot;Fifth Estate&quot; documentary, &quot;The Best Defence&quot;, in February 2003 quoted the former Israeli Defense Minister as saying the Israeli government was so dissatisfied with the performance of the missile defense, that they were preparing their own military retaliation on Iraq regardless of U.S. objections. That response was canceled only with the ceasefire with Iraq.

===US-led invasion of Iraq (2003)===
Patriot was deployed to Iraq a second time in 2003, this time to provide air and missile defense for the forces conducting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Patriot PAC-3, GEM, and GEM+ missiles both had a very high success rate, intercepting Al-Samoud 2 and Ababil-100 tactical ballistic missiles. No longer-range ballistic missiles were fired during that conflict. The systems were stationed in Kuwait and Iraq, and successfully destroyed a number of hostile surface-to-surface missiles using the new PAC-3 and guidance enhanced missiles.

Patriot missile batteries were involved in three friendly fire incidents. On March 23, 2003, a Royal Air Force Tornado was shot down, killing both crew members, Flight Lieutenant Kevin Barry Main (pilot) and Flight Lieutenant David Rhys Williams (navigator/WSO). On March 24, 2003, a USAF F-16CJ Fighting Falcon fired a HARM anti-radiation missile at a Patriot missile battery after the Patriot&#x27;s radar had locked onto and prepared to fire at the aircraft, causing the pilot to mistake it for an Iraqi surface-to-air missile system because the aircraft was in air combat operations and was on its way to a mission near Baghdad. The HARM destroyed the Patriot&#x27;s radar system with no casualties. Afterwards the Patriot Radar was examined and continued to operate, but was replaced due to a chance that a fragment might have penetrated it and gone undetected.

On April 2, 2003, two PAC-3 missiles shot down a USN F/A-18 Hornet, killing U.S. Navy Lieutenant Nathan D. White of VFA-195, Carrier Air Wing Five.

=== Post-2003 service in Iraq ===
A US Army Patriot battery in Erbil, Iraq shot down at least one Iranian ballistic missile during the 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel.

===Service with Israel===
The Israeli Air Defense Command operated MIM-104D Patriot (PAC-2/GEM+) batteries with Israeli upgrades. The Israel Defense Forces&#x27; designation for the Patriot weapon system was &quot;Yahalom&quot; (, &quot;diamond&quot;). On 30 April 2024, the Israeli Air Force published an article stating that their Patriot batteries would be decommissioned in two months, being replaced by &quot;more advanced air systems&quot;. According to &quot;The War Zone&quot;, the Patriot was replaced by the David&#x27;s Sling and Arrow systems. Following the announcement, Ukraine initiated talks on obtaining retired Israeli Patriot systems in April 2024. On 28 January 2025, a US defense official confirmed to the &quot;CNN&quot; that 90 ex-Israeli interceptors were transferred to Ukraine via the United States. Reportedly Kyiv will also receive components for the system, including radars, after being refurbished in the US.

====Operation Protective Edge (2014)====
During Operation Protective Edge, Patriot batteries of the Israeli Air Defense Command intercepted and destroyed two unmanned aerial vehicles launched by Hamas. The interception of a Hamas drone in July 2014, was the first time in the history of the Patriot system&#x27;s use that it successfully intercepted an enemy aircraft.

====Syrian civil war (2014–)====
In Israeli service in the Syrian civil war, Patriot has primarily been active in drone and air defense, rather than a missile defense capacity. In August 2014, a Syrian unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down by an Israeli Air Defense Command MIM-104D Patriot missile near Quneitra, after it had penetrated the airspace over the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. In September 2014, a Syrian Air Force Sukhoi Su-24 was shot down in similar circumstances. Since 2014, Israeli Patriots have missed several Syrian drones, including two misses in July 2016 and another in June 2018; as well as several successful shootdowns against Syrian drones in April 2017 July 11 and July 13, 2018, as well as against a Hezbollah intelligence drone attempting to infiltrate Israel in September 2017 through the Golan. On July 24, 2018, an Israeli Patriot missile shot down a Syrian Sukhoi Su-22 fighter which had crossed into Israeli airspace.

===Service with Saudi Arabia===
Patriot has continued to see usage in Saudi Arabia against Houthi missile attacks. In June 2015, a Patriot battery was used to shoot down a Scud missile, fired at Saudi Arabia by Houthi rebels in response to the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. Another Scud was fired at an electricity station in Jizan Province and intercepted by a Saudi Patriot in August 2015. Saudi Arabia claims that another long-range ballistic missile was fired toward Mecca and intercepted by a Saudi Patriot in October 2016. Houthi sources said that the missile&#x27;s intended target was the air force base in King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, 65 km (40miles) north-west of Mecca. In March 2018, another missile, apparently fired from Yemen, was intercepted by a Patriot missile over Riyadh. Videos showed one interceptor exploded just after launch and another did a &quot;U turn&quot; midair toward Riyadh. During the Abqaiq–Khurais attack in September 2019, the six battalions of Patriot missile defense systems owned by Saudi Arabia failed to protect its oil facilities from attacks by multiple drones and suspected cruise missiles. The United States removed two of its four Patriot antimissile batteries securing oil fields in Saudi Arabia in May 2020, following an easing of tensions with Iran. They were to be replaced by Saudi&#x27;s own Patriot batteries. In February 2021, a Patriot battery intercepted a ballistic missile over Riyadh that was fired by Houthis as a Formula E race was held on the outskirts of the city in Diriyah, attended by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

===Service with the United Arab Emirates===
According to Brigadier General Murad Turaiq, the commander of some of the Yemeni forces allied to the Saudi-led coalition currently fighting in Yemen, Patriot air defense systems deployed to Yemen by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have successfully intercepted two ballistic missiles fired by Houthi forces. General Turaiq told the Abu Dhabi-based &quot;The National&quot; newspaper on November 14, 2015, that the first missile was shot down late the previous day in the Al-Gofainah area and a second was intercepted before it hit the building hosting the control centre for forces operating in Marib and Al-Baydah provinces. Airbus Defence and Space satellite imagery obtained by IHS Jane&#x27;s showed two Patriot fire units, each with two launchers, deployed at the Safir airstrip in Marib province on October 1.

=== Talisman Sabre Exercise ===
In July 2021, the US Army used a battery of Patriot missiles in the Exercise Talisman Saber in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland, Australia. The US Army test fired Patriot PAC-2 interceptor missiles and successfully intercepted target drones.

=== Service with Eastern Europe===
====Patriot sales and contributions to Poland and Ukraine====
Russia&#x27;s 2014 invasion of Crimea led to a &quot;sales burst&quot; for the Patriot system, with Romania, Poland, and Sweden signing onto the system between the start of the invasion and the wider invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, on 9 March 2022, the U.S. European Command announced that it would send two Patriot air defense systems to Poland to &quot;proactively counter any potential threat to U.S. and Allied forces and NATO territory&quot;. Poland asked Germany to transfer the Patriots to Ukraine. Germany declined. On 19 December, Ukraine President Zelenskyy talked about negotiating personally with US President Biden over a potential transfer of Patriot missile systems. He said they offer &quot;a (better) distance, radius of reflection, protection&quot;. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that this was the most difficult diplomatic issue they had faced. One day later, the Biden administration announced it would be delivering another $1.85 billion in aid to Ukraine that would include a Patriot battery During a meeting with Zelenskyy in front of the press at the White House on December 21, Biden confirmed that the United States would send a Patriot battery to Ukraine, noting that it would take &quot;months&quot; to train the &quot;dozens&quot; of soldiers needed to operate the system, probably in Germany. Providing a Patriot missile system is seen as a symbol of Western engagement in the conflict, although its range is only local.

Other nations subsequently announced plans to send their own Patriot batteries. On 5 January 2023, Germany announced that it would supply one Patriot battery to Ukraine as a part of their own military aid package. On 17 January 2023, the Netherlands announced it too will send one launcher, and added a second launcher on 20 January. The Dutch government announced it will send launchers (Dutch: lanceerinrichtingen) and missiles, not complete systems (a battery) which includes radars, etc. On 19 April, a German government website announced that the country had delivered a Patriot system to Ukraine. A second Patriot battery was delivered on April 27 from the United States. On August 9, 2023, it was announced that Germany would provide an additional complete Patriot battery to Ukraine. The system was delivered on December 13 after the Ukrainian crew completed training in Germany.
So, during 2023, three Patriot batteries were delivered to Ukraine.

====Patriot operations in the Russo-Ukrainian War====
Patriot has had a successful track record in Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War, successfully intercepting a wide range of Russian weaponry and aircraft. It has shot down Russian aircraft like Su-34 fighters flying nearly 100 miles away, and intercepted missiles as far as 130 miles away, according to defense NGO reports. During October 2023, under a program called &quot;FrankenSAM&quot; Western and Soviet air defence technologies are being combined in Ukraine. One of three programs involves a Ukrainian radar guiding a Patriot missile. It has been tested and is expected to be operational by winter.

===== Aircraft interceptions - May 2023 =====
On May 13, 2023, a Patriot battery was allegedly used to destroy at least four (possibly five) aircraft belonging to a Russian strike package over Bryansk Oblast, Russia. Visually confirmed losses included a Su-34, Su-35, and two Mil Mi-8 helicopters. On 19 May, U.S. defense officials and congressional staffers told CNN that a Patriot system had been used by the Ukrainian army to shoot down at least one Russian jet a few weeks before. The spokesman of the Ukrainian Air Force later confirmed the shoot down of a Russian Su-34, Su-35, two Mi-8MTPR EW helicopters, and an Mi-8 transport helicopter by the Patriot system.

===== Missile defense =====

During a night time attack on the Kyiv region on May 4, 2023, Ukraine air defense claimed a hypersonic Kh-47M2 Kinzhal ballistic missile was shot down by a Patriot missile defence system. Yurii Ihnat, the spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, initially denied the claim of interception, but on May 6 it was finally confirmed by Commander of the UAF Mykola Oleschuk. Prior to this interception, intercepting a Kinzhal missile was only a &quot;theoretical&quot; capability. Unnamed US officials claimed the missile was aimed at the Patriot system which intercepted it, and that the Ukrainians fired multiple Patriot missiles at different angles to intercept the Kinzhal missile. A Pentagon spokesman later confirmed that Ukraine downed the Kinzhal missile.

On May 16, 2023, the Ukrainian Air Force claimed to have shot down eighteen missiles, including six Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missiles, and uncertain number of attack drones. The Russian Defense Ministry stated in response that six Kinzhal missiles hadn&#x27;t even been fired, and furthermore claimed that a Patriot battery in Kyiv was destroyed by a Kinzhal missile, citing social media footage. U.S. officials confirmed that the Patriot system was damaged, but stated that the damage was &quot;minimal&quot; or &quot;insignificant&quot;, the radar was intact and that the system could likely be repaired locally without needing to be moved out of Ukraine. The battery was returned to operational status after minor repairs. It has not yet been established whether the Patriot had been damaged by the fragments of the downed Russian missile or by a direct hit. The following day, U.S. officials told the New York Times that &quot;a Patriot system had been damaged in the attack but added that the Patriot remained operational against all threats,&quot; while Deputy Pentagon Spokeswoman Sabrina Singh announced that the Patriot system had been fixed, with assistance from the US. In contradiction to the U.S. announcement, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that the system&#x27;s multifunctional radar station and five launchers were destroyed.

After two missile attacks on May 29, 2023, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy announced that all missiles were intercepted and according to Ukrainian Air Force spokesman, Yuriy Ihnat, these were assumed to likely be Iskander-M ballistic missiles. Dashcam video captured the debris from an expended PAC-3 CRI missile falling in between passing vehicles.

==== Losses ====
On March 9, 2024, video footage emerged showing the destruction of an Armed Forces of Ukraine convoy that allegedly contained at least two M901 Patriot missile launchers near the city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast. The convoy was reportedly struck by a Russian Iskander-M ballistic missile. The Armed Forces of Ukraine has not commented on the video.

On 5 April 2024, a damaged Ukrainian Patriot launcher was delivered to the United States. It is not yet known exactly where the launcher was damaged.

===Demands on Patriot systems===

Including the United States, 18 countries operate Patriot missile systems. Outside the US, only Japan&#x27;s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries appears to build Patriot missiles, under licence from various US companies. This has led to a demand on the US Army. Patriot batteries are the most deployed units in the US Army by early 2021. Some units have had a 6-month deployment extended up to 15 months. The missile is currently being used in active service in Saudi Arabia. In active use by the IDF in the &quot;southern Negev desert&quot;. The Patriot missile batteries are also seeing active service in Ukraine, where there are three batteries in service. To refill US stockpiles, Japan has modified its export rules to allow export of missiles to the United States. Previously only specific components could be exported now entire missiles can be exported. They cannot be sent directly to Ukraine, however they can backfill US stockpiles. Recent withdrawal of the missiles from the Middle East were done to help deal with a potential crisis in the Pacific. Likewise Germany has withdrawn its three Patriot units from Poland.

NATO has announced a plan to purchase some 1000 Patriot missiles. A $5.5 billion contract has been awarded to Raytheon and MBDA to establish a new production facility in Germany. The U.S. is also ramping up production domestically. In 2018, Lockheed Martin was building 350 PAC-3 MSE missiles annually and was working to ramp up its production to 500 missiles a year prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In December 2023, Lockheed hit their production goal of 500 missiles per year, and is &quot;fully funded by the U.S. Army to build 550 missiles annually&quot; at its new 85,000 square-foot Camden, Arkansas facility. Lockheed has announced plans to ramp up production of PAC-3 MSE interceptors to 650 annually by 2027, though it notes this will be done through internal investment, having not received Army funding for the production increase. Lockheed also intends to increase export shipments for the missile, with six new international customers signing letters of approval in 2023. Aerojet Rocketdyne, which produces the PAC-3 MSE motor, opened a 51,000 square foot production facility next to Lockheed&#x27;s Camden site in 2022, and has increased rocket motor production by 60% from 70,000 in 2021 to 115,000 in 2023 across all types including the PAC-3 MSE rocket motor.

On 20 June 2024, the US government is set to announce the suspension of all exports of Patriot missiles and systems “until Ukraine has enough to defend itself from Russia’s air attacks”. This decision affects five countries who have agreed to the suspension. The Romanian government has announced that it will send a “full” Patriot battery to Ukraine, provided that the US government “help(s) cover the gap”.
