<text>Captain Kangaroo is an American children&#x27;s television series that aired weekday mornings on the American television network CBS for 29 years, from 1955 to 1984, making it the longest-running nationally broadcast children&#x27;s television program of its day. In 1986, the American Program Service (now American Public Television, Boston) integrated some newly produced segments into reruns of past episodes, distributing the newer version of the series to PBS and independent public stations until 1993.

The show was conceived by Bob Keeshan, who also played the title character &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, and who based the show on &quot;the warm relationship between grandparents and children&quot;. Keeshan had portrayed the original Clarabell the Clown on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Howdy Doody Show&quot; during the network&#x27;s early years.

&quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; had a loose structure, built around life in the &quot;Treasure House&quot; where the Captain (the name &quot;kangaroo&quot; came from the bigger pockets in his coat) would tell stories, meet guests, and indulge in silly stunts with regular characters, both humans and puppets. Keeshan performed as the Captain more than 9,000 times over the nearly 30-year run of the show.

The May 17, 1971, episode had two major changes on the show: The Treasure House was renovated and renamed &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Place&quot; and the Captain replaced his navy blue coat with a red coat. In September 1981, CBS shortened the hour-long show to a half-hour, briefly retitled it &quot;Wake Up with the Captain&quot;, and moved it to an earlier time slot; it was moved to weekends in September 1982, and returned to an hour-long format. CBS canceled &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; at the end of 1984.

An episode of the show in 1981 became professional skateboarder Tony Hawk&#x27;s first appearance on television.

&quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; was the longest running children&#x27;s television show until 1997 when it was surpassed by &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, which itself was surpassed by &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 2003. &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; is still far and away the longest running children&#x27;s TV series by episode count with 6,090. Second place holder &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, has aired 4,731 episodes, still 1,389 episodes short.

==Format==

The show takes place in and around the Treasure House, later called the Captain&#x27;s Place, where the Captain would interact with puppets, guests, and other members of the cast. Even the opening sequence changed.

Each episode began with the theme music playing, then the Captain makes his entrance to the studio by unlocking and opening the doors of the Treasure House from the inside, where viewers would catch their first glimpse of him. Then he puts the Treasure House keys on a nail, and the music ends. On rare occasions, the Captain could not get the keys to stay on the nail, and when they fell off, the theme song plays again. One never knew exactly what would happen from one episode to the next, although at certain times of the year, such as the Christmas season, paper cutout versions of such stories as &quot;The Littlest Snowman&quot; would be shown.

===Cartoons===
Several cartoon shorts were featured over the course of the series&#x27; run, including:

A cartoon starring a funnel-capped shape-shifting boy named &quot;Tom Terrific&quot; was part of the show in the 1950s and 1960s. Tom had a sidekick named Mighty Manfred the Wonder Dog, and a nemesis, Crabby Appleton (&quot;I&#x27;m rotten to the core!&quot;). Other cartoons included &quot;Lariat Sam&quot;, who (aided by his loyal horse &quot;Tippytoes&quot;), confronted his nemesis &quot;Badlands Meanie&quot; and his sidekick &quot;Bushwhack&quot;. &quot;The Adventures of Lariat Sam&quot; was developed by veteran game show announcer Gene Wood, then a show staffer (who also sang the cartoon&#x27;s theme song).

The British cartoon &quot;Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings&quot; appeared in the 1970s, featuring a child with magic chalk who could create all sorts of short-lived creations in short adventures (the original version featured a British narrator, Bernard Cribbins, but Keeshan&#x27;s voice was dubbed onto the cartoons for their U.S. airing).

Another British-produced cartoon, &quot;Ludwig&quot;, about a magical egg-shaped robot, was also included around the same time as &quot;Simon&quot;. The cartoon&#x27;s musical score consisted of selections from the works of Beethoven.

Also appearing in the 1970s was &quot;The Most Important Person&quot;, a series of five-minute segments on the importance of life, and &quot;The Kingdom of Could Be You&quot;, a series of five-minute segments on the importance of careers and the work world.

The cartoon series called &quot;The Toothbrush Family&quot; was based on an extended family of hygiene utensils, as the name suggests; they would embark on adventures based in the bathroom, like water skiing in the tub, or rescuing friends caught in the drain. Episodes were generally a few minutes each and basically revolved around teaching children the importance of dental care.

A silent cartoon in the 1970s named &quot;Crystal Tipps and Alistair&quot; featured the adventures of a young girl and her dog. Later reruns were narrated by the voice of Mr. Moose. Another British favorite, &quot;The Wombles&quot;, was also featured.

&quot;The Red and the Blue&quot; shorts from Italy, as well as &quot;The Undersea Adventures of Captain Nemo&quot;, featuring a family of sea explorers, were also shown.

===&quot;Good morning, Captain!&quot;===
Starting in 1974, the show opened with different people wishing the Captain &quot;good morning&quot;. Many of the openings featured noncelebrities, but some featured stars from TV shows, most of which broadcast over CBS. The montage of &quot;good mornings&quot; always ended with the Captain himself returning the greeting before the opening sequence.

===Regular features===
Other regular features included &quot;The Magic Drawing Board&quot; and the Captain&#x27;s &quot;Reading Stories&quot; sessions, which introduced kids to stories such as &quot;Curious George&quot;, &quot;Make Way for Ducklings&quot;, &quot;Stone Soup&quot;, &quot;Caps for Sale&quot;, and &quot;Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel.&quot; The Sweet Pickles books were also featured.
Songs were a regular part of the show, from &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; to many traditional tunes to popular songs interpreted by puppets. Carmino Ravosa was a songwriter on the show from 1975 to 1977.

On the first show of every month, the Captain had a birthday cake for all of the children with birthdays that month.

Keeshan also had a recurring role as the Town Clown, a pantomime piece that took place in and around the exposed wagon home of a tramp-like circus clown. Like the character Clarabelle that he played on &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;, the Town Clown never spoke.

Favorite characters on the show were Grandfather Clock (voiced by Cosmo Allegretti), Bunny Rabbit, Rollo the Hippo, and Dancing Bear. Dancing Bear was mute and only appeared in short subject features. He often danced waltzes to background music.

One of the show&#x27;s long-running gags was the &quot;Ping-Pong Ball Drop&quot;, instigated by the telling of a joke (usually a knock-knock joke) by Mr. Moose, in which the punchline included the words &quot;ping-pong balls&quot;. At the mention of those three words, a shower of ping-pong balls was released from above on the Captain.

The show often had simple black light theatre segments using paper or cardboard cutouts. A notable recording of a popular song, such as Judy Garland&#x27;s Decca recording of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; (from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;), Mary Martin singing &quot;Never Never Land&quot; (from the original cast recording of the musical &quot;Peter Pan&quot;), or Danny Kaye singing &quot;Inchworm&quot; (from the Decca recording of the songs from &quot;Hans Christian Andersen&quot;) were heard while the cutouts played on the screen, animated by a concealed puppeteer. On other occasions, full-fledged hand puppets &quot;performed&quot; to the song being played (as in the case when a hand puppet dressed in Spanish clothing performed to a recording of tenor Allan Jones singing &quot;The Donkey Serenade&quot;).

Also, about two or three times in an episode, short film clips on certain topics played over a song about that particular topic.

Especially in later seasons, the show also featured a running gag in selected episodes during which the Captain would try to perform a particular activity three or four times, only to fail in a different way with each attempt.

Familiar props included a mockup of a talking cathedral-style radio that Keeshan simply called Radio. Keeshan would turn the large knobs on Radio to get a conversation going. Reminiscent of the old Atwater Kent cathedrals, Radio had a rather interesting conversation with a smaller transistor radio in one show. Also featured was a huge Colgate toothpaste box with a large windup or clockwork key on the side. Keeshan turned the key to play a jingle (&quot;Colgate Fluoride M-F-P/Helps Prevent the Cavity/And it Tastes Great, Naturally!&quot;) for the show&#x27;s sponsor, Colgate Toothpaste.

At the end of each episode, the Captain always encouraged parents watching the show to spend some quality time with their children every day, and he often demonstrated various creative ways in which to do so. In later seasons, that changed to him saying, &quot;Well, what would you like to do today? You know it could be a good day for...&quot; then a song would list many different activities while short film clips of each corresponding activity are presented, then the song ended with the singers saying, &quot;There&#x27;s so much to do. These things are just a few.&quot; Then it would cut back to the Captain, who would sign off with, &quot;So whatever &quot;you&quot; do, have a great day!&quot;

==Theme song==
The first theme song for &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; titled &quot;Puffin&#x27; Billy&quot; was used from the show&#x27;s debut in 1955 until 1974. It was an instrumental piece of light music, written by Edward G. White and recorded by the Melodi Light Orchestra. The track was from a British stock music production library known as the Chappell Recorded Music Library, which was sold through a New York agency called Emil Ascher. The tune&#x27;s original title referred to a British steam locomotive. The tune was used on various programs on both sides of the Atlantic and was already popular in the United Kingdom: for example, two years before &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, it served as the wrap-up music for an episode of the radio program &quot;Rocky Fortune&quot; called &quot;Murder Among the Statues&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it became famous as the theme to the weekly BBC radio program &quot;Children&#x27;s Favourites&quot; from 1952 to 1966, and is still widely recognised by the postwar generation. It was later used in the Enid Blyton parody &quot;Five Go Mad in Dorset&quot; and in a number of British TV advertisements, including a Captain Sensible spot. The &quot;Puffin&#x27; Billy&quot; theme played as the opening of each episode, with the music continuing until the Captain hung his large ring of keys on a nail, which seemed to act as a switch to end the music abruptly. If the Captain&#x27;s keys ever slipped off the nail, the music plays again. In 1957, lyricist Mary Rogers penned lyrics to the tune, creating a newly titled &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; song.

In 1974, a new theme song titled &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot; was composed for &quot;Captain Kangaroo,&quot; written by Robert L. Brush. As the new theme used similar melodic elements from the original theme, Edward G. White&#x27;s name was added to the song credits. However, due to copyright issues, the song was re-recorded in 1979 without the portion of &quot;Puffin&#x27; Billy&quot; featured in the first version. During the brief &quot;Wake Up With the Captain&quot; era, a theme titled &quot;Wake Up&quot; was used, but was dropped after the program moved to weekends. For the show&#x27;s later seasons from 1982 to 1984 and subsequent PBS run, &quot;Schoolhouse Rock&quot; mainstay Lynn Ahrens (who composed and performed a few &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; songs herself) wrote a new theme, entitled &quot;Here Comes Captain Kangaroo&quot;.

The theme song for &quot;The All New Captain Kangaroo&quot; used the opening notes and part of the melody of the original theme as its introduction. Bob Keeshan also recorded music for both Columbia Records and Golden Records, aimed at introducing all kinds of music to children.

==Schedule history==
While &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; was still in planning stages, CBS executives had the idea of hiring Al Lewis, who was hosting a popular kids&#x27; show at WCPO-TV in Cincinnati, to host their program. But when station management refused to release Lewis from his contract, they selected Keeshan to host. Lewis&#x27; own program, &quot;The Uncle Al Show&quot;, ended its run in Cincinnati a year after &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; left CBS.
CBS aired the program on weekday mornings, initially telecast live in the Eastern and Central time zones at 8:00 am (ET)/7:00 am (CT) for its first four years (it would eventually be scheduled for 8:00 am in all time zones). Same-day episodes would be broadcast on kinescope for Western audiences, as Keeshan would not perform the show live three times a day. For the first three months, &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; was only seen on weekday mornings. From December 1955 until 1968, the show was also seen on Saturday mornings, except in the 1964–1965 season, when it was replaced by a Keeshan vehicle called &quot;Mr. Mayor&quot;. Except for pre-emption by news or special events, notably the four-day continuous coverage which followed the November 22, 1963, assassination of John F. Kennedy, and a few shows that were 45 minutes, the show aired a full 60 minutes on weekday mornings until 1981.

The audience of children could never compete in the ratings with such entertainment/news shows as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, although &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; won Emmy Awards three times as Outstanding Children&#x27;s entertainment series in 1978–1979, 1982–1983, and 1983–1984. In the fall of 1981, to make more room for the expansion of &quot;The CBS Morning News&quot;, the Captain was moved to an earlier time slot of 7:00 am and cut to 30 minutes, sporting the new title &quot;Wake Up with the Captain&quot;. The show was moved again in the spring of 1982 to 6:30 am, a time when few children (or adults) were awake. In the fall of 1982, it returned to an hour format, but was moved to Saturday mornings at 7:00 am ET and 6:00 am in other time zones. Reruns from the previous season were offered to CBS affiliates to run Sunday morning in place of the cartoon reruns offered before, but most declined. One-third of affiliates no longer ran the show at all after 1982, and it was again reduced to a half-hour in the fall of 1984. Angered over the reduction of his program for the second time, Keeshan chose to step down at the end of 1984, after his contract with CBS expired. After the show ended, Children&#x27;s Television Workshop hired some of its staff to work on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

Just over a year later, on September 1, 1986, &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; returned in reruns on PBS, with funding from public television stations, School Zone Publishing Company, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. American Public Television, then known as the Interregional Program Service, distributed the show, along with Britder Associates (Keeshan&#x27;s production company).

The original director of the program was Peter Birch, who helmed the program for its first 25 years. Producer Jimmy Hirschfeld took over as director following Birch&#x27;s heart attack in 1980 and continued directing, as well as producing throughout the rest of the show&#x27;s run, including the new segments inserted into the PBS reruns, until it went off the air in 1993.

The cast of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; also hosted the CBS coverage of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade for several years in the 1960s.

==Schwinn marketing==
From the late 1950s, the Schwinn Bicycle Company made use of children&#x27;s television programming to expand its dominance of the child and youth bicycle markets. The company was an early sponsor (from 1958) of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. The Captain himself was enlisted to sell Schwinn-brand bicycles to the show&#x27;s audience, typically six years old and under. At the end of each live Schwinn marketing promotion, Bob Keeshan would intone, &quot;Schwinn bikes—the quality bikes—are best!&quot; and &quot;Prices slightly higher in the South and in the West&quot;. The on-air marketing program was deemed successful by Schwinn, and the company increased its market share of child and youth bicycles throughout the 1960s.

The marketing program continued through the 1971 season, when the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s Staff Report, &quot;Guidelines on Advertising to Children&quot;, recommended against Schwinn&#x27;s on-air marketing practices using the show&#x27;s host. In response, Schwinn and the show&#x27;s writers altered the format in 1972. The Captain no longer insisted that his viewers purchase a Schwinn, but instead made regular on-air consultations of a new character, Mr. Schwinn Dealer. A 1973 internal company news article concluded that the show&#x27;s child audience had difficulty separating Schwinn&#x27;s sales pitch from the regular content of the show.

== 1997 reboot==
In 1997–2000, a rebooted series titled &quot;The All New Captain Kangaroo&quot; was produced by Saban Entertainment in association with TLC Entertainment. Eric S. Rollman, who also served as President of Saban and Fox Family Productions, was executive producer. George Taweel and Rob Loos of TLC produced the series. John McDonough played the Captain on this version, which was shot in Tampa, Florida, and featured animal segments shot at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and Seaworld in Orlando. Keeshan was invited to appear as a special guest called &quot;The Admiral&quot;, but declined. Thirteen episodes were produced for syndication with an additional twenty-seven episodes serving as the centerpiece for a programming block on Fox, Fox Kids Network (later known as Fox Kids), and The Family Channel (later known as Fox Family Channel) dubbed &quot;Captain Kangaroo&#x27;s Treasure House&quot;, from 1997 to 2000; the block also featured reruns of &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends&quot; and &quot;Magic Adventures of Mumfie&quot;, as well a spin-off show, &quot;Mister Moose&#x27;s Fun Time&quot;, which included cartoon segments from around the world, as well as clips from The Wiggles. When Disney bought Fox Family, the company shelved &quot;The All New Captain Kangaroo&quot; and &quot;Mister Moose&#x27;s Fun Time&quot;, allegedly due to the fact the reboot advertised Busch Gardens &amp; Seaworld, rivals of Walt Disney World. 

In 2011, the trademark for the Captain Kangaroo name was acquired by the Cashin Comedy Co. In a blog, the Captain is portrayed by Pat Cashin, an entertainer and professional clown. Cashin died in 2016 at the age of 48, leaving the rights to this version with his estate. Creative Artists Agency, the successor to &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;&#x27;s previous rights holders Marvin Josephson Associates and ICM Partners, is the current owner of the series.

<text>Robert James Keeshan (June 27, 1927 – January 23, 2004) was an American television producer and actor. He created and played the title role in the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, which ran from 1955 to 1984, the longest-running nationally broadcast children&#x27;s television program of its day. He also played the original Clarabell the Clown on the &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; television program.

==Early life==
Bob Keeshan was born to Irish parents in Lynbrook, New York. After an early graduation in 1945 from Forest Hills High School in Queens, New York, during World War II, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, but was still in the United States when Japan surrendered. He attended Fordham University on the GI Bill. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in education in 1951.

An urban legend claims that actor Lee Marvin said on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that he had fought alongside Keeshan at the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Over time, this legend has been published verbatim. Other legends had compounded on it, such that Keeshan was a trained killer, that he was awarded the Navy Cross, that he was a tough sergeant who saved the lives of dozens of men and women in the war, and that he destroyed a German tank in action in North Africa (an apparent confusion with a similarly named British soldier). However, Marvin never made the statement (he never served in Iwo Jima, but was wounded during the Battle of Saipan). Keeshan never saw combat in Europe or Japan, having enlisted too late to serve overseas. The Naval Historical Center in Washington, D.C, still receives calls asking for verification of Keeshan&#x27;s &quot;heroic&quot; war service. Keeshan continuously dispelled the rumors.

==Television career==

Network television programs began shortly after the end of the war. &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;, which premiered in 1947 on NBC, was one of the first. Starting on January 3, 1948, Keeshan played Clarabell the Clown, a silent Auguste clown who communicated by honking several horns attached to a belt around his waist. One honk meant &quot;yes&quot;; two meant &quot;no&quot;. Clarabell often sprayed Buffalo Bob Smith with a seltzer bottle and played practical jokes. Keeshan had conflicts with Smith and in late 1952 left the show, or possibly was fired, after hiring an agent for himself and other workers on the show.

By September 21, 1953, Keeshan came back to local TV on WABC-TV, Channel 7 in New York City, in a new children&#x27;s show, &quot;Time for Fun&quot;. He played Corny the Clown, and this time he spoke. Later that same year, in addition to &quot;Time for Fun&quot;, he began &quot;Tinker&#x27;s Workshop&quot;, a program aimed at preschoolers, where he played the grandfather-like Tinker.

Developing ideas from &quot;Tinker&#x27;s Workshop&quot;, Keeshan and his long-time friend Jack Miller submitted the concept of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; to the CBS network, which was looking for innovative approaches to children&#x27;s television programming. CBS approved the show, and Keeshan starred as the title character when it premiered on CBS on October 3, 1955. He described his character as based on &quot;the warm relationship between grandparents and children&quot;. The show was an immediate success, and he served as its host for nearly three decades.

Recurring characters included his sidekick (and fan favorite) Mr. Green Jeans (played by Hugh &quot;Lumpy&quot; Brannum), Dennis (played by Cosmo Allegretti), and puppets such as Bunny Rabbit and Mr. Moose.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; commented: &quot;Captain Kangaroo, a round-faced, pleasant, mustachioed man possessed of an unshakable calm ... was one of the most enduring characters television ever produced.&quot;

Keeshan also had a Saturday morning show called &quot;Mister Mayor&quot; during the 1964–65 season. Keeshan, in his role as the central characters in both &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; and &quot;Mister Mayor&quot;, heavily promoted the products of the Schwinn Bicycle Co., a sponsor, directly on-air to his audience. By 1972, he had introduced another character on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; to recommend Schwinn products: Mr. Schwinn Dealer, due to the Federal Trade Commission ruling against children&#x27;s show hosts directly endorsing their sponsor&#x27;s products during their programs after 1969.

Keeshan had a longtime close friendship with Fred Rogers of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. Each paid visits to the other&#x27;s show in 1970, and they appeared together on the PBS special &quot;Springtime with Mister Rogers&quot; in 1980. The following year, Rogers appeared briefly in Keeshan&#x27;s TV special &quot;Good Evening, Captain&quot; (following Keeshan&#x27;s 1981 heart attack); Rogers and Dick Clark presented Keeshan with flowers at the end of the show.

Keeshan did voice recordings for a number of albums for Columbia Records, Golden Records and RCA-Victor. Several were of children&#x27;s songs performed with other characters from &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, but other albums included &quot;A Child&#x27;s Introduction to Jazz&quot;, narration for &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; conducted by Leopold Stokowski, and &quot;Captain Kangaroo Introduces You to the Nutcracker Suite&quot;.

==Heart attack and retirement==
Keeshan suffered a severe heart attack just moments after stepping off a plane at Toronto Pearson International Airport on July 11, 1981, which pushed the start of a revamped version of his show back to at least mid-August. He had come to the city to accept a children&#x27;s service award.

Keeshan underwent triple-bypass surgery and received an estimated 5,000 get-well wishes from fans during his hospitalization.

Following the heart attack, Keeshan received three Emmy Awards for Outstanding Performer in 1982, 1983, and 1984. Despite these accolades, Keeshan&#x27;s show was shortened from its hour-long format to 30 minutes in 1981, to make room for the expansion of the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; lineup. The program was retitled &quot;Wake Up with the Captain&quot;, and moved to a new 7:00 am time slot. At the start of 1982, the show was rescheduled to an even earlier slot of 6:30 am. In the fall of 1982, CBS installed it as a weekend-only hour offering, and two years later, in the fall of 1984, the show became a Saturday half-hour entry.

Tired of CBS&#x27;s constant reductions of his show, Keeshan left &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; when his contract with the network ended in December 1984, just nine months shy of the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary. By 1987, repeats of the show were airing daily on many PBS stations.

Keeshan&#x27;s show was given a farewell of sorts with &quot;Captain Kangaroo and Friends&quot;, a primetime network TV special that aired in 1985.

==Later life==
After &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; ended, Keeshan hosted 1985&#x27;s &quot;CBS Storybreak&quot;, which featured animated versions of children&#x27;s literature. He appeared in framing sequences for the animated stories, showcasing the book versions and suggesting similar books for the viewers to seek out. In 1987, he founded Corporate Family Solutions with former Tennessee Republican governor Lamar Alexander, which provided day-care programs to businesses.

He was a strong advocate against video game violence and took part in congressional hearings in 1993. He also joined with parents&#x27; groups in the 1980s who protested children&#x27;s TV shows based on toys like He-Man and Transformers, feeling that toys turned into TV shows did not teach children anything about the real world. He also made a rare film appearance in &quot;The Stupids&quot; in 1996.

In 1997, he starred as the Wizard in the St. Louis Muny outdoor theater production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

In the 1990s, Keeshan expressed an interest in bringing back a new version of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; as a gentler and kinder answer to the violent cartoons on children&#x27;s television. Despite having sponsors and television stations lined up, he was unable to obtain permission from ICM, the company that owned the rights to &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; at that time. In 1994, Keeshan was featured as a semi-regular on the FX daytime talk show &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;.

==Personal life==
Keeshan was married to Anne Jeanne Laurie Keeshan for 45 years, until her death February 25, 1996. They had three children: Michael Derek, Laurie Margaret, and Maeve Jeanne.

Keeshan resided on Melbury Road in Babylon Village, Long Island, New York, before moving to spend the last 14 years of his life in Norwich, Vermont, where he became a children&#x27;s advocate, as well as an author. His memoirs, &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot;, were published in 1995 by Fairview Press. Bob Keeshan died in Windsor, Vermont, on January 23, 2004, at age 76. He was buried in Saint Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery in Babylon, New York.

Keeshan&#x27;s grandson, Britton Keeshan, became the youngest person at that time to have climbed the Seven Summits by climbing Mount Everest in May 2004. He carried photographs of his grandfather on that ascent, and he buried a photo of the two of them at the summit.

<text>The cicadas () are a superfamily, the Cicadoidea, of insects in the order Hemiptera (true bugs). They are in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha, along with smaller jumping bugs such as leafhoppers and froghoppers. The superfamily is divided into two families, the Tettigarctidae, with two species in Australia, and the Cicadidae, with more than 3,000 species described from around the world; many species remain undescribed. Nearly all of cicada species are annual cicadas with the exception of the few North American periodical cicada species, genus &quot;Magicicada&quot;, which in a given region emerge en masse every 13 or 17 years.

Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. They have an exceptionally loud song, produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of drum-like tymbals. The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates. They typically live in trees, feeding on watery sap from xylem tissue, and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic. The vast majority of species are active during the day as adults, with some calling at dawn or dusk. Only a rare few species are known to be nocturnal.

One exclusively North American genus, &quot;Magicicada&quot; (the periodical cicadas), which spend most of their lives as underground nymphs, emerge in predictable intervals of 13 or 17 years, depending on the species and the location. The unusual duration and synchronization of their emergence may reduce the number of cicadas lost to predation, both by making them a less reliably available prey (so that any predator that evolved to depend on cicadas for sustenance might starve waiting for their emergence), and by emerging in such huge numbers that they will satiate any remaining predators before losing enough of their number to threaten their survival as a species.

The annual cicadas are species that emerge every year. Though these cicadas&#x27; life cycles can vary from 1 to 9 or more years as underground nymphs, their emergence above ground as adults is not synchronized, so some members of each species appear every year.

Cicadas have been featured in literature since the time of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and as motifs in art from the Chinese Shang dynasty. They have also been used in myth and folklore as symbols of carefree living and immortality. The cicada is also mentioned in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Shield&quot; (ll.393–394), in which it is said to sing when millet first ripens. Cicadas are eaten by humans in various parts of the world, including China, Myanmar, Malaysia, and central Africa.

==Etymology==

The name is directly from the onomatopoeic Latin &quot;cicada&quot;.

==Taxonomy and diversity==
The superfamily Cicadoidea is a sister of the Cercopoidea (the froghoppers). Cicadas are arranged into two families: the Tettigarctidae and Cicadidae. The two extant species of the Tettigarctidae include one in southern Australia and the other in Tasmania. The family Cicadidae is subdivided into the subfamilies Cicadettinae, Cicadinae, Derotettiginae, Tibicininae (or Tettigadinae), and Tettigomyiinae, and they are found on all continents except Antarctica. Some previous works also included a family-level taxon called the Tibiceninae. The largest species is the Malaysian emperor cicada &quot;Megapomponia imperatoria&quot;; its wingspan is up to about . Cicadas are also notable for the great length of time some species take to mature.

At least 3,000 cicada species are distributed worldwide, in essentially any habitat that has deciduous trees, with the majority being in the tropics. Most genera are restricted to a single biogeographical region, and many species have a very limited range. This high degree of endemism has been used to study the biogeography of complex island groups such as in Indonesia and Asia. There are several hundred described species in Australia and New Zealand, around 150 in South Africa, over 170 in America north of Mexico, at least 800 in Latin America, and over 200 in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific.

About 100 species occur in the Palaearctic. A few species are found in southern Europe, and a single species was known from England, the New Forest cicada, &quot;Cicadetta montana&quot;, which also occurs in continental Europe. Many species await formal description and many well-known species are yet to be studied carefully using modern acoustic analysis tools that allow their songs to be characterized.

Many of the North American species are the annual or jarfly or dog-day cicadas, members of the &quot;Neotibicen&quot;, &quot;Megatibicen&quot;, or &quot;Hadoa&quot; genera, so named because they emerge in late July and August. The best-known North American genus, however, may be &quot;Magicicada&quot;. These periodical cicadas have an extremely long life cycle of 13 or 17 years, with adults suddenly and briefly emerging in large numbers.

Australian cicadas are found on tropical islands and cold coastal beaches around Tasmania, in tropical wetlands, high and low deserts, alpine areas of New South Wales and Victoria, large cities including Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, and Tasmanian highlands and snowfields. Many of them have common names such as cherry nose, brown baker, red eye, greengrocer, yellow Monday, whisky drinker, double drummer, and black prince. The Australian greengrocer, &quot;Cyclochila australasiae&quot;, is among the loudest insects in the world.

More than 40 species from five genera populate New Zealand, ranging from sea level to mountain tops, and all are endemic to New Zealand and its surrounding islands (Kermadec Islands, Chatham Islands). One species is found on Norfolk Island, which technically is part of Australia. The closest relatives of the NZ cicadas live in New Caledonia and Australia.

===Palaeontology===
Fossil Cicadomorpha first appeared in the Late Triassic. The superfamily Palaeontinoidea contains three families. The Upper Permian Dunstaniidae are found in Australia and South Africa, and also in younger rocks from China. The Upper Triassic Mesogereonidae are found in Australia and South Africa. This group, though, is currently thought to be more distantly related to Cicadomorpha than previously thought.
The Palaeontinidae or &quot;giant cicadas&quot; (though only distantly related to true cicadas) come from the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of Eurasia and South America. The first of these was a fore wing discovered in the Taynton Limestone Formation of Oxfordshire, England; it was initially described as a butterfly in 1873, before being recognised as a cicada-like form and renamed &quot;Palaeontina oolitica&quot;.

Tettigarctidae and Cicadidae had diverged from each other prior to or during the Jurassic, as evidenced by fossils related to both lineages present by the Middle Jurassic (~ 165 million years ago) The morphology of well preserved fossils of early relatives of Cicadidae from the mid Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar suggests that unlike many modern cicadids, they were either silent or only made quiet sounds. Most fossil Cicadidae are known from the Cenozoic, and the oldest unambiguously identified modern cicadid is &quot;Davispia bearcreekensis&quot; (subfamily Tibicininae) from the Paleocene, around 56-59 million years ago.

==Biology==

===Description===


Cicadas are large insects made conspicuous by the courtship calls of the males. They are characterized by having three joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and three to six segments, including a seta at the tip. The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on the rear of the fore wing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hind wing.

Cicadas are feeble jumpers, and nymphs lack the ability to jump altogether. Another defining characteristic is the adaptations of the fore limbs of nymphs for underground life. The relict family Tettigarctidae differs from the Cicadidae in having the prothorax extending as far as the scutellum, and by lacking the tympanal apparatus.
The adult insect, known as an imago, is in total length in most species. The largest, the empress cicada (&quot;Megapomponia imperatoria&quot;), has a head-body length around , and its wingspan is . Cicadas have prominent compound eyes set wide apart on the sides of the head. The short antennae protrude between the eyes or in front of them. They also have three small ocelli located on the top of the head in a triangle between the two large eyes; this distinguishes cicadas from other members of the Hemiptera. The mouthparts form a long, sharp rostrum that they insert into the plant to feed. The postclypeus is a large, nose-like structure that lies between the eyes and makes up most of the front of the head; it contains the pumping musculature.

The thorax has three segments and houses the powerful wing muscles. They have two pairs of membranous wings that may be hyaline, cloudy, or pigmented. The wing venation varies between species and may help in identification. The middle thoracic segment has an operculum on the underside, which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of the abdomen. The abdomen is segmented, with the hindermost segments housing the reproductive organs, and terminates in females with a large, saw-edged ovipositor. In males, the abdomen is largely hollow and used as a resonating chamber.

The surface of the fore wing is superhydrophobic; it is covered with minute, waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a water-repellent film. Rain rolls across the surface, removing dirt in the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on the wings. When the droplets coalesce, the cicada leaps several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean the wings. Bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled; rather, their membranes are torn apart by the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the wing surface the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.

===Temperature regulation===

Desert cicadas such as &quot;Diceroprocta apache&quot; are unusual among insects in controlling their temperature by evaporative cooling, analogous to sweating in mammals. When their temperature rises above about , they suck excess sap from the food plants and extrude the excess water through pores in the tergum at a modest cost in energy. Such a rapid loss of water can be sustained only by feeding on water-rich xylem sap. At lower temperatures, feeding cicadas would normally need to excrete the excess water. By evaporative cooling, desert cicadas can reduce their bodily temperature by some 5 °C. Some non-desert cicada species such as &quot;Magicicada tredecem&quot; also cool themselves evaporatively, but less dramatically. Conversely, many other cicadas can voluntarily raise their body temperatures as much as 22 °C (40 °F) above ambient temperature.

===Song===
The &quot;singing&quot; of male cicadas is produced principally and in the majority of species using a special structure called a tymbal, a pair of which lies below each side of the anterior abdominal region. The structure is buckled by muscular action and, being made of resilin, unbuckles rapidly on muscle relaxation, producing their characteristic sounds. Some cicadas, however, have mechanisms for stridulation, sometimes in addition to the tymbals. Here, the wings are rubbed over a series of midthoracic ridges. In the Chinese species &quot;Subpsaltria yangi&quot;, both males and females can stridulate. The sounds may further be modulated by membranous coverings and by resonant cavities.

The male abdomen in some species is largely hollow, and acts as a sound box. By rapidly vibrating these membranes, a cicada combines the clicks into apparently continuous notes, and enlarged chambers derived from the tracheae serve as resonating chambers with which it amplifies the sound. The cicada also modulates the song by positioning its abdomen toward or away from the substrate (their perch). Partly by the pattern in which it combines the clicks, each species produces its own distinctive mating songs and acoustic signals, ensuring that the song attracts only appropriate mates. The tettigarctid (or hairy) cicadas have rudimentary tymbals in both sexes and do not produce airborne sounds, rather, both males and females produce vibrations that are transmitted through the tree they perch upon. They are considered as representing the original state from which other cicada communication has evolved.


Average temperature of the natural habitat for the South American species &quot;Fidicina rana&quot; is about . During sound production, the temperature of the tymbal muscles was found to be significantly higher. Many cicadas sing most actively during the hottest hours of a summer day; roughly a 24-hour cycle. Most cicadas are diurnal in their calling and depend on external heat to warm them up, while a few are capable of raising their temperatures using muscle action and some species are known to call at dusk. &quot;Kanakia gigas&quot; and &quot;Froggattoides typicus&quot; are among the few that are known to be truly nocturnal and there may be other nocturnal species living in tropical forests.

Cicadas call from varying heights on trees. Where multiple species occur, the species may use different heights and timing of calling. While the vast majority of cicadas call from above the ground, two Californian species, &quot;Okanagana pallidula&quot; and &quot;O. vanduzeei&quot; are known to call from hollows made at the base of the tree below the ground level. The adaptive significance is unclear, as the calls are not amplified or modified by the burrow structure, but this may avoid predation.

Although only males produce the cicadas&#x27; distinctive sounds, both sexes have membranous structures called tympana (singular – tympanum) by which they detect sounds, the equivalent of having ears. Males disable their own tympana while calling, thereby preventing damage to their hearing; a necessity partly because some cicadas produce sounds up to 120 dB (SPL) which is among the loudest of all insect-produced sounds. The song is loud enough to cause permanent hearing loss in humans should the cicada be at &quot;close range&quot;. In contrast, some small species have songs so high in pitch that they are inaudible to humans.

For the human ear, telling precisely where a cicada song originates is often difficult. The pitch is nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.

The songs of cicadas are considered by entomologists to be unique to a given species, and a number of resources exist to collect and analyse cicada sounds.

===Life cycle===

In some species of cicadas, the males remain in one location and call to attract females. Sometimes, several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move from place to place, usually with quieter calls, while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs. Both male and female cicadas die within a few weeks after emerging from the soil. Although they have mouthparts and are able to consume some plant liquids for nutrition, the amount eaten is very small and the insects have a natural adult lifespan of less than two months.

When the eggs hatch, the newly hatched nymphs drop to the ground and burrow. Cicadas live underground as nymphs for most of their lives at depths down to about . Nymphs have strong front legs for digging and excavating chambers near to roots, where they feed on xylem sap. In the process, their bodies and interior of the burrow become coated in anal fluids. In wet habitats, larger species construct mud towers above ground to aerate their burrows. In the final nymphal instar, they construct an exit tunnel to the surface and emerge. They then molt (shed their skins) on a nearby plant for the last time, and emerge as adults. The exuviae or abandoned exoskeletons remain, still clinging to the bark of the tree.

Most cicadas go through a life cycle that lasts 2–5 years. Some species have much longer life cycles, such as the North American genus, &quot;Magicicada&quot;, which has a number of distinct &quot;broods&quot; that go through either a 17-year (Brood XIII), or in some parts of the region, a 13-year (Brood XIX) life cycle The long life cycles may have developed as a response to predators, such as the cicada killer wasp and praying mantis. A specialist predator with a shorter life cycle of at least two years could not reliably prey upon the cicadas; for example, a 17-year cicada with a predator with a five-year life cycle will only be threatened by a peak predator population every 85 (5 × 17) years, while a non-prime cycle such as 15 would be endangered at every year of emergence. An alternate hypothesis is that these long life cycles evolved during the ice ages so as to overcome cold spells, and that as species co-emerged and hybridized, they left distinct species that did not hybridize having periods matching prime numbers. The 13- and 17-year cicadas only emerge in the midwestern and eastern US in the same year every 221 years (13 × 17), with 2024 being the first such year since 1803.

===Diet===
Cicada nymphs drink sap from the xylem of various species of trees, including oak, cypress, willow, ash, and maple. While common folklore indicates that adults do not eat, they actually do drink plant sap using their sucking mouthparts. 

Cicadas excrete fluid in streams of droplets due to their high volume consumption of xylem sap. The jets of urine that cicadas produce have a velocity of up to 3 meters per second, making them the fastest among all assessed animals, including mammals like elephants and horses.

===Locomotion===
Cicadas, unlike other Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation). They have the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight, but they do not walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel distances greater than a few centimetres.

==Predators, parasites, and pathogens==

Cicadas are commonly eaten by birds and mammals, as well as bats, wasps, mantises, spiders, and robber flies. In times of mass emergence of cicadas, various amphibians, fish, reptiles, mammals, and birds change their foraging habits so as to benefit from the glut. Newly hatched nymphs may be eaten by ants, and nymphs living underground are preyed on by burrowing mammals such as moles. In northern Japan, brown bears prey on final instar nymphs of cicadas during summer by digging up the ground. In Australia, cicadas are preyed on by the Australian cicada killer wasp (&quot;Exeirus lateritius&quot;), which stings and stuns cicadas high in the trees, making them drop to the ground, where the cicada hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100 m, until they can be shoved down into its burrow, where the numb cicadas are placed onto one of many shelves in a &quot;catacomb&quot;, to form the food stock for the wasp grub that grows out of the egg deposited there. A katydid predator from Australia is capable of attracting singing male cicadas of a variety of species by imitating the timed click replies of sexually receptive female cicadas, which respond in pair formation by flicking their wings. Their prime-number life cycle prevents predators with a life cycle of two or more years from synchronising with their emergence.

Several fungal diseases infect and kill adult cicadas, while other fungi in the genera &quot;Ophiocordyceps&quot; and &quot;Isaria&quot; attack nymphs. &quot;Massospora cicadina&quot; specifically attacks the adults of periodical cicadas, the spores remaining dormant in the soil between outbreaks. This fungus is also capable of dosing cicadas with psilocybin, the psychedelic drug found in magic mushrooms, as well as cathinone, an alkaloid similar to various amphetamines. These chemicals alter the behaviour of the cicadas, driving males to copulate, including attempts with males, and is thought to be beneficial to the fungus, as the fungal spores are dispersed by a larger number of infected carriers.

Plants can also defend themselves against cicadas. Although cicadas can feed on the roots of gymnosperms, it has been found that resinous conifers such as pine do not allow the eggs of &quot;Magicicada&quot; to hatch, the resin sealing up the egg cavities.

===Antipredator adaptations===

Cicadas use a variety of strategies to evade predators. Large cicadas can fly rapidly to escape if disturbed. Many are extremely well camouflaged to evade predators such as birds that hunt by sight. Being coloured like tree bark and disruptively patterned to break up their outlines, they are difficult to discern; their partly transparent wings are held over the body and pressed close to the substrate. Some cicada species play dead when threatened.

Some cicadas such as &quot;Hemisciera maculipennis&quot; display bright deimatic flash coloration on their hind wings when threatened; the sudden contrast helps to startle predators, giving the cicadas time to escape. Most cicadas are diurnal and rely on camouflage when at rest, but some species use aposematism-related Batesian mimicry, wearing the bright colors that warn of toxicity in other animals; the Malaysian &quot;Huechys sanguinea&quot; has conspicuous red and black warning coloration, is diurnal, and boldly flies about in full view of possible predators.

Predators such as the sarcophagid fly &quot;Emblemasoma&quot; hunt cicadas by sound, being attracted to their songs. Singing males soften their song so that the attention of the listener gets distracted to neighbouring louder singers, or cease singing altogether as a predator approaches. A loud cicada song, especially in chorus, has been asserted to repel predators, but observations of predator responses refute the claim.

== In human culture ==
=== In art and literature ===

Cicadas have been featured in literature since the time of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, and as motifs in decorative art from the Chinese Shang dynasty (1766–1122 BCE). They are described by Aristotle in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; and by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Natural History&quot;; their mechanism of sound production is mentioned by Hesiod in his poem &quot;Works and Days&quot;: &quot;when the Skolymus flowers, and the tuneful &quot;Tettix&quot; sitting on his tree in the weary summer season pours forth from under his wings his shrill song&quot;. In the classic 14th-century Chinese novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Diaochan took her name from the sable (&quot;diāo&quot;) tails and jade decorations in the shape of cicadas (&quot;chán&quot;), which adorned the hats of high-level officials.

In the Japanese novel &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, the title character poetically likens one of his many love interests to a cicada for the way she delicately sheds her robe the way a cicada sheds its shell when molting. Cicada exuviae play a role in the manga &quot;Winter Cicada&quot;. Cicadas are a frequent subject of &quot;haiku&quot;, where, depending on type, they can indicate spring, summer, or autumn. Shaun Tan&#x27;s illustrated book &quot;Cicada&quot; tells the story of a hardworking but underappreciated cicada working in an office. Branden Jacobs-Jenkins&#x27; play &quot;Appropriate&quot; takes place on an Arkansas farm in summer, and calls for the sounds of mating cicadas to underscore the entire show.

=== In fashion ===
Being lightweight, and with hooklike legs, the exuviae of cicadas can be used as hair or clothing accessories.

=== As food and folk medicine ===

Cicadas were eaten in Ancient Greece, and are consumed in selected regions in modern China, both as adults and (more often) as nymphs. Cicadas are also eaten in Malaysia, Burma, North America, and central Africa, as well as the Balochistan region of Pakistan, especially in Ziarat. Female cicadas are prized for being meatier. Shells of cicadas are employed in traditional Chinese medicines, claiming that they possess anti-convulsive, sedative, and hypothermic effects. The 17-year &quot;Onondaga Brood&quot; &quot;Magicicada&quot; is culturally important and a particular delicacy to the Onondaga people, and are considered a novelty food item by modern consumers in several states.

=== In music ===
Cicadas are featured in the protest song &quot;Como La Cigarra&quot; (&quot;Like the Cicada&quot;) written by Argentinian poet and composer María Elena Walsh. In the song, the cicada is a symbol of survival and defiance against death. The song was recorded by Mercedes Sosa, among other Latin American musicians.

In North America and Mexico, there is a well-known song, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Cicada&quot;), written by Raymundo Perez Soto, which is a song in the Mariachi tradition, that romanticises the insect as a creature that sings until it dies.

Brazilian artist Lenine with his track &quot;Malvadeza&quot; from the album &quot;Chão&quot;, creates a song built upon the sound of the cicada that can be heard along the track.

Cicada sounds heavily feature on the 2021 album &quot;Solar Power&quot; by New Zealand artist Lorde. She described cicada song as being emblematic of the New Zealand summer.

=== In mythology and folklore ===
Cicadas have been used as money, in folk medicine, to forecast the weather, to provide song (in China), and in folklore and myths around the world. In France, the cicada represents the folklore of Provence and the Mediterranean cities.

The cicada has represented since classical antiquity. Jean de La Fontaine began his collection of fables &quot;Les fables de La Fontaine&quot; with the story &quot;La Cigale et la Fourmi&quot; (&quot;The Cicada and the Ant&quot;) based on one of Aesop&#x27;s fables; in it, the cicada spends the summer singing, while the ant stores away food, and the cicada finds herself without food when the weather turns bitter.

In Chinese tradition, the cicada (, &quot;chán&quot;) symbolises rebirth and immortality. In the Chinese essay &quot;Thirty-Six Stratagems&quot;, the phrase &quot;to shed the golden cicada skin&quot; () is the poetic name for using a decoy (leaving the exuviae) to fool enemies. In the Chinese classic novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; (16th century), the protagonist Priest of Tang was named the Golden Cicada.

In Japan, the cicada is associated with the summer season. For many Japanese people, summer hasn&#x27;t officially begun until the first songs of the cicada are heard. According to Lafcadio Hearn, the song of &quot;Meimuna opalifera&quot;, called &quot;tsuku-tsuku boshi&quot;, is said to indicate the end of summer, and it is called so because of its particular call.

In the Homeric &quot;Hymn to Aphrodite&quot;, the goddess Aphrodite retells the legend of how Eos, the goddess of the dawn, requested Zeus to let her lover Tithonus live forever as an immortal. Zeus granted her request, but because Eos forgot to ask him to also make Tithonus ageless, Tithonus never died, but he did grow old. Eventually, he became so tiny and shriveled that he turned into the first cicada. The Greeks also used a cicada sitting on a harp as an emblem of music.

In Kapampangan mythology in the Philippines, the goddess of dusk, Sisilim, is said to be greeted by the sounds and appearances of cicadas whenever she appears.

===As pests===
Cicadas feed on sap; they do not bite or sting in a true sense, but may occasionally mistake a person&#x27;s arm for a plant limb and attempt to feed. Male cicadas produce very loud calls that can damage human hearing.

Cicadas are not major agricultural pests, but in some outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugarcane, which affects the crop adversely, and in a few isolated cases, females have oviposited on cash crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus, and cotton.

Cicadas sometimes cause damage to ornamental shrubs and trees, mainly in the form of scarring left on tree branches where the females have laid their eggs. Branches of young trees may die as a result.

He is known for his roles in two science-fiction television series: as Sam Beckett on &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; – for which he was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards (winning one) – and as Captain Jonathan Archer on &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. From 2014 to 2021, he portrayed Special Agent Dwayne Cassius &quot;King&quot; Pride on &quot;&quot;.

==Career==
Bakula moved to New York City in 1976. He made his professional debut in the 1977 national tour of the musical &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. He made his Broadway debut in 1982 as an understudy in the short-lived musical &quot;Is There Life After High School?&quot; The following year, he appeared as baseball legend Joe DiMaggio in &quot;&quot;, which only ran 17 performances. He received a shared Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Ensemble Acting for his performance in the 1985 Off-Broadway production of &quot;Three Guys Naked from the Waist Down&quot;; he would later appear in its Pasadena Playhouse production. The success of &quot;Three Guys&quot; Off-Broadway brought him attention, and when his next show, the musical &quot;Nightclub Confidential&quot;, which co-starred his wife Krista Neumann, moved to Los Angeles, he moved there at the urging of his California agent, Maggie Henderson, and his New York agent, Jerry Hogan. As Bakula recalled in 2000:
He was cast in two short-lived series: &quot;Gung Ho&quot; and &quot;Eisenhower &amp; Lutz&quot;. During a Hollywood writers&#x27; strike in 1988, he returned to New York to star in &quot;Romance/Romance&quot; on Broadway, which ran from May 1, 1988, to January 15, 1989. For his performance as Alfred Von Wilmers and Sam, he was nominated for the 1988 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Afterward, he landed the lead role opposite co-star Dean Stockwell in the science fiction television series &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; (1989–1993).

==Personal life==
Bakula married Krista Neumann in 1981. They had two children before divorcing in 1995. He married actress Chelsea Field in 2009 after a 15-year relationship. Bakula and Field have two children.

Bakula says he was &quot;hardly ever home for four and a half seasons&quot; of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, so he chose to prioritize his family life on later projects. His &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; contract required that filming be completed by 6p.m. every Wednesday so he could have dinner with his family. During filming of &quot;&quot;, he returned home to Los Angeles every weekend to spend time with his wife.

<text>Charles Rennie Mackintosh (7 June 1868 – 10 December 1928) was a Scottish architect, designer, water colourist and artist. His artistic approach had much in common with European Symbolism. His work, alongside that of his wife Margaret Macdonald, was influential on European design movements such as Art Nouveau and Secessionism and praised by great modernists such as Josef Hoffmann. Mackintosh was born in Glasgow, Scotland and died in London, England. He is among the most important figures of Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style).

==Early life and education==

Charles Rennie Mackintosh was born at 70 Parson Street, Townhead, Glasgow, on 7 June 1868, the fourth of eleven children and second son of William McIntosh, a superintendent and chief clerk of the City of Glasgow Police. He attended Reid&#x27;s Public School and the Allan Glen&#x27;s Institution from 1880 to 1883. William&#x27;s wife Margaret Mackintosh née &#x27;Rennie&#x27; grew up in the Townhead and Dennistoun (Firpark Terrace) areas of Glasgow.

==Name==

He changed the spelling of his name from &#x27;McIntosh&#x27; to &#x27;Mackintosh&#x27; for unknown reasons, as his father did before him, around 1893. Confusion continues to surround the use of his name with &#x27;Rennie&#x27; sometimes incorrectly substituted for his first name of &#x27;Charles&#x27;. The modern use of &#x27;Rennie Mackintosh&#x27; as a surname is also incorrect and he was never known as such in his lifetime; &#x27;Rennie&#x27; being a middle name (his mother&#x27;s maiden name) which he used often in writing his name. Signatures took various forms including &#x27;C.R. Mackintosh&#x27; and &#x27;Chas. R. Mackintosh.&#x27; The usage of &quot;Rennie Mackintosh&quot; to refer to him is therefore incorrect and he should instead be referred to as &quot;Charles Rennie Mackintosh&quot; or &quot;Mackintosh&quot;. Mackintosh is also sometimes referred to affectionately as &#x27;Toshie&#x27;, a nickname seen in correspondence and other contemporary literature written by friends and family members.

==Career and family==
Mackintosh entered the architectural profession in 1884 as an apprentice to John Hutchinson in Glasgow and in the evenings studied at Glasgow School of Art (situated then in Sauchiehall Street) where he became a prize-winning student. In 1889 he joined Honeyman and Keppie (John Honeyman and John Keppie), a major architectural practice as a draughtsman and designer, where in 1901 he became a partner.

His early design work as a draughtsman and lead designer can be seen from 1893 in the interior of Craigie Hall, Dumbreck, and in the new saloon and gallery of Glasgow Art Club, 185 Bath Street for which he signed the drawings.

Around 1892, Mackintosh met fellow artist Margaret Macdonald at the Glasgow School of Art. He and fellow student Herbert MacNair, also an apprentice at Honeyman and Keppie, were introduced to Margaret and her sister Frances MacDonald by the head of the Glasgow School of Art, Francis Henry Newbery, who saw similarities in their work. Margaret and Charles married on 22 August 1900. The couple had no children. MacNair and Frances also married the previous year. The group worked collaboratively and came to be known as &quot;&quot;, and were prominent figures in Glasgow Style art and design. Mackintosh and Margaret married, setting up their first home in Mains Street on Blythswood Hill, the street later being renamed as Blythswood Street, Glasgow. Subsequently, they moved to Southpark Avenue, close to Glasgow University.

In the early 1910s the partnership known from 1901 as Honeyman, Keppie &amp; Mackintosh declined in profitability, and in 1913 Mackintosh resigned from the partnership and attempted to open his own practice.

==Design influences==
Mackintosh lived most of his life in the city of Glasgow, located on the banks of the River Clyde. During the Industrial Revolution the city had one of the greatest production centres of heavy engineering and shipbuilding in the world. As the city grew and prospered, a faster response to the high demand for consumer goods and arts was necessary. Industrialized, mass-produced items started to gain popularity. Along with the Industrial Revolution, Asian style and emerging modernist ideas also influenced Mackintosh&#x27;s designs. When the Japanese isolationist regime softened, they opened themselves to globalisation resulting in notable Japanese influence around the world. Glasgow&#x27;s link with the eastern country became particularly close with shipyards at the River Clyde being exposed to Japanese navy and training engineers. Japanese design became more accessible and gained great popularity. In fact, it became so popular and so incessantly appropriated and reproduced by Western artists, that the Western world&#x27;s fascination and preoccupation with Japanese art gave rise to the new term Japonisme or Japonism.

This style was admired by Mackintosh because of its restraint and economy of means rather than ostentatious accumulation; its simple forms and natural materials rather than elaboration and artifice; and its use of texture and light and shadow rather than pattern and ornament. In the old western style, furniture was seen as ornament that displayed the wealth of its owner; the value of the piece was established according to the length of time spent creating it. In the Japanese arts, furniture and design focused on the quality of the space, which was meant to evoke a calming and organic feeling to the interior.
At the same time a new philosophy concerned with creating functional and practical design was emerging throughout Europe: modernism. The central aim in modernism was to develop a purity of expression with designs explicitly responsive to intended building use. Ornament and traditional styles were demoted. Although Mackintosh has been counted as a pioneer of modernism, his work always retained a decorative sensibility and features ornament. Mackintosh took his inspiration from his Scottish upbringing and blended them with the flourish of Art Nouveau and the simplicity of Japanese forms.

While working in architecture, Charles Rennie Mackintosh developed his own style: a contrast between strong right angles and floral-inspired decorative motifs with subtle curves (for example, the Mackintosh Rose motif), along with some references to traditional Scottish architecture. The project that helped make his international reputation was the Glasgow School of Art (1897–1909). During the early stages of the Glasgow School of Art Mackintosh also completed the Queen&#x27;s Cross Church project in Maryhill, Glasgow. It is the only built Mackintosh church design and is now the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society headquarters. As with his contemporary Frank Lloyd Wright, Mackintosh&#x27;s architectural designs often included extensive specifications for the detailing, decoration, and furnishing of his buildings. 

It has been suggested that this detailing may have been carried out in part by his wife Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh whom Charles had met when they both attended the Glasgow School of Art. However scholarly evidence for this is scant relying on stylistic analysis or speculation; little documentary material is extant. Their work was shown at the eighth Vienna Secession Exhibition in 1900. Mackintosh&#x27;s architectural career was a relatively short one, but of significant quality and impact. All his major commissions were between 1895 and 1906, including designs for private homes, commercial buildings, interior renovations and churches.

===Unbuilt designs===
Although moderately popular (for a period) in his native Scotland, most of Mackintosh&#x27;s more ambitious designs were not built. Designs for various buildings for the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition were not constructed, neither was his &quot;Haus eines Kunstfreundes&quot; (Art Lover&#x27;s House) of the same year. He competed in the 1903 design competition for Liverpool Cathedral, but failed to gain a place on the shortlist (the winner was Giles Gilbert Scott).

Other unbuilt Mackintosh designs include:
*Railway Terminus
*Concert Hall
*Alternative Concert Hall
*Bar and Dining Room
*Exhibition Hall
*Science and Art Museum
*Chapter House

&quot;The House for An Art Lover (1901)&quot; was built in Bellahouston Park, Glasgow after his death (1989–1996).

&quot;An Artist&#x27;s Cottage and Studio (1901)&quot;, known as &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Cottage&quot;, was completed at Farr by Inverness in 1992. The architect was Robert Hamilton Macintyre acting for Dr and Mrs Peter Tovell. Illustrations can be found on the RCAHMS Canmore site.

The first of the unexecuted &quot;Gate Lodge, Auchinbothie (1901)&quot; sketches was realised as a mirrored pair of gatehouses to either side of the Achnabechan and The Artist&#x27;s Cottage drives, also at Farr by Inverness. Known as &quot;North House&quot; and &quot;South House&quot;, these were completed 1995–1997.

Mackintosh&#x27;s architectural output was small, but he did influence European design. Popular in Austria and Germany, his work received acclaim when it was shown at the Vienna Secession Exhibition in 1900. It was also exhibited in Budapest, Hungary, Munich, Germany, Dresden, Venice, Italy and Moscow, Russia.

==Design work and paintings==
Mackintosh, his future wife Margaret MacDonald, her sister Frances MacDonald, and Herbert MacNair met at evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art (see above). They became known as a collaborative group, &quot;The Four&quot;, or &quot;The Glasgow Four&quot;, and were prominent members of the &quot;Glasgow School&quot; movement. The group exhibited in Glasgow, London, England and Vienna, Austria. These exhibitions helped establish Mackintosh&#x27;s reputation. The so-called &quot;Glasgow&quot; style was exhibited in Europe and influenced the Viennese Art Nouveau movement known as &quot;Sezessionstil&quot; (in English, the Vienna Secession) around 1900. 

Mackintosh also worked in interior design, furniture, textiles and metalwork. Much of this work combines Mackintosh&#x27;s own designs with those of his wife, whose flowing, floral style complemented his more formal, rectilinear work. The publishing house Blackie and Son commissioned him in the 1920s to work on bindings for their publications. One of these works was an abstract design that was intended for a new uniform of G. A. Henty&#x27;s novels. It was instead used for &quot;Yarns on the Beach&quot; by Henty, and for a series entitled &quot;The Boys and Girls Bookshelf&quot;, . Both Newbolt and Floyer speculate that Mackintosh may have designed the cover for another series by Blackie.

==Later life==

Later in life, disillusioned with architecture, Mackintosh worked largely as a watercolourist, painting numerous landscapes and flower studies (often in collaboration with Margaret, with whose style Mackintosh&#x27;s own gradually converged). They moved to the Suffolk village of Walberswick in 1914. There Mackintosh was suspected of being a German spy and briefly arrested in 1915 during World War I.

By 1923, the Mackintoshes had moved to Port Vendres, a Mediterranean coastal town in southern France with a warm climate that was a comparably cheaper location in which to live. Mackintosh had entirely abandoned architecture and design and concentrated on watercolour painting. He was interested in the relationships between man-made and naturally occurring landscapes and created a large portfolio of architecture and landscape watercolour paintings. Many of his paintings depict Port Vendres, a small port near the Spanish border, and the landscapes of Roussillon. The local Charles Rennie Mackintosh Trail details his time in Port Vendres and shows the paintings and their locations. The couple remained in France for two years, before being forced to return to London in 1927 due to illness.
That year, Mackintosh had developed a lump in his tongue and a doctor friend in Port Vendres recommended that he return to London for treatment. In London, after a diagnosis of tongue cancer, a friend Jessie Newbery arranged for treatment at Westminster Hospital where the lump was surgically removed. Their friends Randolph &amp; Birdie Schwabe found a home for Mackintosh to convalesce on Willow Road in Hampstead, where he could sit under a willow tree that reminded him of Sauchiehall Street. Another friend Margaret Morris visited him there, and firstly tried to help him with voice exercises to strengthen his voice which had been weakened by the surgery, but when that failed she tried to teach him sign language. A dispute with the upstairs neighbours in Hampstead forced Mackintosh and his wife to quickly seek other lodgings, and another friend Desmond Chapman-Huston offered his home at 12 Porchester Square, Bayswater, returning the hospitality that they had shown him whenever he had visited them in Glasgow. After a relapse Mackintosh was admitted to a nursing home just along the road at 26 Porchester Square where he died on 10 December 1928 at the age of 60. He was cremated the next day at Golders Green Crematorium in London. His ashes were scattered, in accordance with his wishes, over the Mediterranean at Port Vendres from one of the rocks he had painted.

==Retrospect==
Mackintosh&#x27;s work grew in popularity in the decades following his death. A number of posthumous presentations of his designs have been implemented. The Mackintosh House (1981) is a dedicated structure by William Whitfield to house the reconstructed interiors of the Mackintoshes former Glasgow home (sited nearby and demolished in 1963). The house forms an integral part of The University of Glasgow&#x27;s Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery home to the world&#x27;s largest collection of Mackintosh&#x27;s work. The Artist&#x27;s Cottage project, three unrealised designs from 1901, were constructed as interpretations near Inverness in 1992 and 1995. The House for an Art Lover was built in Glasgow&#x27;s Bellahouston Park in 1996 as an interpretation of a design competition portfolio by Mackintosh and Macdonald from 1901. Mackintosh&#x27;s design language continues to be echoed in modern buildings in Glasgow - for instance the replacement Glasgow Sheriff Court, built in the 1980s to a design by the successor firm to Mackintosh&#x27;s old employer - Keppie Design - incorporates many interior features which are a modern interpretation of Mackintosh&#x27;s style.

The Glasgow School of Art building (now &quot;The Mackintosh Building&quot;) is cited by architectural critics as among the finest buildings in the UK. On 23 May 2014 the building was ravaged by fire. The library was destroyed, but firefighters managed to save the rest of the building. On 15 June 2018, about a year before completion of the restoration of the building the School was again struck by fire. This second fire caused catastrophic damage, effectively destroying all the interiors and leaving the outer walls so structurally unstable that large sections of them had to be taken down to prevent uncontrolled collapse. Such was the global concern that a public commitment to faithfully rebuild The Mackintosh Building was made post-fire by then Director of The Glasgow School of Art, Tom Inns.

The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society encourages greater awareness of the work of Mackintosh as an architect, artist and designer. The rediscovery of Mackintosh as a significant figure in design has been attributed to the designation of Glasgow as European City of Culture in 1990, and exhibition of his work which accompanied the year-long festival. His enduring popularity since has been fuelled by further exhibitions and books and memorabilia which have illustrated aspects of his life and work. The growth in public interest has led to refurbishment of long-neglected buildings and increased public access: Scotland Street School Museum housed in Mackintosh&#x27;s 1906 school building opened in 1990. 78 Derngate Northampton opened as a visitor attraction in 2003. The Willow Tea Rooms re-opened following an extensive restoration in 2018.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City held a major retrospective exhibition of Charles Rennie Mackintosh&#x27;s works from 21 November 1996 to 16 February 1997. In conjunction with the exhibit were lectures and a symposium by scholars, including Pamela Robertson of the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow art gallery owner Roger Billcliffe, and architect J. Stewart Johnson, and screening of documentary films about Mackintosh.

Charles Rennie Mackintosh was commemorated on a series of banknotes issued by the Clydesdale Bank in 2009; his image appeared on an issue of £100 notes.

In 2012, one of the largest collections of art by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow Four Glasgow School was sold at auction in Edinburgh for £1.3m. The sale included work by Mackintosh&#x27;s sister-in-law Frances Macdonald and her husband Herbert MacNair.

In July 2015 it was announced that Mackintosh&#x27;s designs for a tearoom would be reconstructed to form a display in Dundee&#x27;s new V&amp;A museum. Although the original building which housed the tearoom on Glasgow&#x27;s Ingram Street was demolished in 1971 the interiors had all been dismantled and put into storage. The restored &quot;Oak Room&quot; was revealed when V&amp;A Dundee opened to the public on 15 September 2018.

In June 2018, a mural depicting Mackintosh and using elements of his distinctive style was created in Glasgow to honour the 150th anniversary of the artist&#x27;s birth. It is made by Glasgow street artist, Rogue One and commissioned by the Radisson Red.

From 1986 until 1992, InterCity locomotive 86226 was named &quot;Charles Rennie Mackintosh&quot;. In March 2018, Virgin Trains West Coast named 390008 &quot;Charles Rennie Mackintosh&quot;.

<text>Charles Macintosh FRS (29 December 1766 – 25 July 1843) was a Scottish chemist and the inventor of the modern waterproof raincoat. The Mackintosh raincoat (the variant spelling is now standard) is named after him.

==Biography==
Macintosh was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of George Macintosh and Mary Moore, and was first employed as a clerk. Charles devoted his spare time to science, particularly chemistry, and before he was 20 resigned his clerkship to study under Joseph Black at the University of Edinburgh, and to take up the manufacture of chemicals. In this he was highly successful and invented various new processes. His experiments with naphtha led to his invention of waterproof rubberized fabric; the essence of his patent was the cementing of two thicknesses of cloth together with natural rubber. The rubber is made soluble by the action of the naphtha. The naphtha was prepared by distillation of coal tar, with the Bonnington Chemical Works being a major supplier.

Macintosh married Mary Fisher in 1790, daughter of Alexander Fisher, a Glasgow merchant. They had one son, George Macintosh (1791–1848). And one daughter, Mary Scott Macintosh. In 1823, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society for his chemical discoveries. In 1828, he became a partner with James Beaumont Neilson in a firm to exploit the latter&#x27;s patent for the hot blast blowing of blast furnaces, which saved considerably on their fuel consumption.

Charles died in 1843 and was buried in the Glasgow Cathedral graveyard. He is buried with his parents in the ground of his great-grandfather, John Anderson of Douhill, Lord Provost of Glasgow. His name is added to the 17th century monument which stands against the eastern boundary wall. A late 19th century secondary memorial also exists, in polished red granite, slightly to the north, where Charles is again mentioned on the grave of his son, George.

==Legacy==
On 29 December 2016, the search engine Google marked the 250th anniversary of the birth of the inventor of the waterproof raincoat with a Google doodle of Macintosh in the rain.

<doc id="54605" wikidata="Q7691157" url="?curid=54605" title="TeachText">
<text>The TeachText application is a simple text editor made by Apple Computer and included with System 7.1 and earlier. It was created by Apple programmer Bryan Stearns with later versions created by Stearns and Francis Stanbach. TeachText was one of the only applications included with System 7, leading to its frequent role as the application to open &quot;ReadMe&quot; files. It was named &quot;TeachText&quot; as a nod to this role in tutorials and other introductory materials.

TeachText was derived from the Edit application, which was a simple text editor for the early pre-System 6 Apple Macintosh computers. Edit was included with early versions of the basic system software to demonstrate the use of the Macintosh user interface, and as the primary code editing tool for the original 68000 Macintosh Development System. While Edit was a tool and demonstration program for developers, TeachText was used mainly by users to display ReadMe documents.

Since the first Macintosh models came with a full-featured word processor, MacWrite, software publishers commonly shipped documentation in its native format. When Apple stopped bundling MacWrite, ownership was transferred to Claris, so developers could not distribute it on their programs&#x27; installation floppy disks. With no text program present on the disks, owners without a second floppy disk drive or hard disk could be left with no way to view documentation or installation instructions. Apple supplied TeachText as a small, freely-distributable program to address this need.

TeachText could only operate on a single document at a time and supported only the default text font (12-point Geneva at the time) in the MacRoman encoding, with formatting such as bold, italic and underline. It also included rudimentary support for embedded images; the images were stored in PICT format in the file&#x27;s resource fork in ascending numbers from zero, instances of non-breaking spaces in the text loaded up the appropriately numbered image, the first instance loading image &quot;0&quot;, the second space loading image &quot;1&quot;, and so on.

TeachText was automatically associated with all TEXT type codes for files with an unknown Creator code. That is, if a user attempted to open any text file and the original program that created it was not known on the local computer, TeachText would be asked to open the file in its place. In this respect, TeachText was the &quot;default editor&quot; of the Mac system, playing a role similar to Notepad under Microsoft Windows.

The underlying text engine was the TextEdit Manager built into Mac OS. TextEdit had originally been written to support very small runs of editable text, like those found in Save as... dialogs and similar roles. As such, it had been written with a short integer as a length counter, and could thus only handle up to 32 kB of text in a file. This conflicted with the &quot;default editor&quot; role when it was asked to open files longer than 32k, resulting in an error.

TeachText was later replaced by SimpleText, and with the arrival of Mac OS X, both were replaced by the TextEdit application inherited from OPENSTEP.

<text>TextEdit is an open-source word processor and text editor, first featured in NeXT&#x27;s NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP. It is now distributed with macOS since Apple Inc.&#x27;s acquisition of NeXT, and available as a GNUstep application for other Unix-like operating systems such as Linux. It is powered by Apple Advanced Typography.

== Implementation ==
TextEdit replaced the text editor of previous Macintosh operating systems, SimpleText. TextEdit uses the Cocoa text system to read and write documents in Rich Text Format (RTF), Rich Text Format Directory, plain text, and HTML formats, and can open (but not save) old SimpleText files. It also has access to the operating system&#x27;s built-in spell-checking service. The version included in Mac OS X v10.3 added the ability to read and write documents in Word format, and the version in Mac OS X v10.4 added the ability to read and write Word XML documents. The version included in Mac OS X v10.5 added read and write support for Office Open XML and OpenDocument Text. The version included in Mac OS X v10.6 added automatic spelling correction, support for data detectors, and text transformations. The version included in Mac OS X v10.7 added versioning of files, and Autosave similar to iOS.

Formatted text, justification, and even the inclusion of graphics and other multimedia elements are supported by TextEdit, as well as the ability to read and write to different character encodings, including Unicode (UTF-8 and UTF-16). TextEdit automatically adjusts letter spacing in addition to word spacing while justifying text. TextEdit does not support multiple columns of text.

The high-resolution TextEdit 1.5 icon found in Mac OS X versions starting with 10.5 (Leopard) features an extract from Apple&#x27;s &quot;Think different&quot; ad campaign. This was replaced by a blank sheet of notebook paper in 10.10 (Yosemite).

==Source code==
Apple formerly distributed TextEdit&#x27;s source code as part of the documentation of its integrated development environment (IDE) Xcode. On the Internet, the source code of TextEdit can be found in Apple&#x27;s &quot;Mac Developer Library&quot;. The following quote is from the characteristic part of the BSD-3-Clause-compliant license text included in the source code:

<text>Fashion Police is an American television series that premiered on September 10, 2010, on E!. It was originally hosted by Joan Rivers and featured panelists George Kotsiopoulos, Giuliana Rancic, and Kelly Osbourne commenting on celebrity fashions.

==Background==
In 2010, the series returned to E! with the program running the day after events, rather than airing live from the red carpet. The series became a weekly program on September 10, 2010, where they continued to discuss the dos and don&#x27;ts of celebrity fashion. The show started as a half-hour program but expanded to one hour on March 9, 2012.

Rivers died on September 4, 2014; two weeks later, it was announced that the series would continue without her. On December 1, 2014, E! announced that comedian Kathy Griffin would replace Rivers as host starting in January 2015. She was joined by celebrity fashion stylist Brad Goreski, who replaced panelist George Kotsiopoulos. Griffin&#x27;s debut episode, following the 2015 Golden Globes, was watched by 912,000 viewers. The episode following the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, on January 26, 2015, was watched by 686,000 viewers.

Kathy Griffin succeeded Rivers after a three-month hiatus following Rivers&#x27; death in September 2014, while Brad Goreski replaced Kotsiopoulos upon its relaunch. Osbourne departed the program in late February 2015 after the February 23rd post-Oscars special show, citing her decision to &quot;pursue other opportunities&quot;. Shortly after, Griffin announced her departure from the show in March 2015 after filming only seven episodes.

In March 2015, E! announced that the show would remain on hiatus until September 2015, in order to revamp the series and replace the vacant panelist positions, following the departure of Griffin and Osbourne.

In June 2015, it was announced the series would return on August 31, 2015, and would feature Melissa Rivers as a new co-host and would return for six episodes with both Goreski and Rancic returning, with a search commencing for a fourth panelist. For the sixth season, Margaret Cho and NeNe Leakes joined the panel.

On October 18, 2017, it was announced that the series would be cancelled with a series finale featuring never before seen clips of Joan Rivers airing November 27, 2017, as it became clear the show could not continue without Joan Rivers in some role.

== Hosts ==

===Timeline===
===Departures===
In March 2015, Kelly Osbourne departed the program in late February 2015 after the February 23rd post-Oscars special show, citing her decision to &quot;pursue other opportunities&quot;. Shortly after, Griffin announced her departure from the show in March 2015 after filming only seven episodes. E! announced that the show would remain on hiatus until September 2015, in order to revamp the series and replace the vacant panelist positions, following the departure of Griffin and Osbourne.

==Segments==
Regular segments include:

* The Five Must-See Looks of the Week, the five outfits that stood out (either by being good or bad) generally worn by Hollywood celebrities during the week in review.
* Bitch Stole My Look, in which two or more stars are shown to have worn the same outfit on different occasions. Rivers and the panelists discuss the stars in question and declare which person looked best in the outfit. Both the loser and the winner may be subject to ridicule, with the winner being chosen as the lesser of two evils.
* Busted!, in which celebrities are caught wearing the same outfit at two or more different events.
* Gotta Have It!, Make It Stop!, in which new trends among celebrities are discussed deciding whether we should have them or make them stop.
* Hot Ticket, in which the panelist discuss looks by celebrities shown at the premiere of a movie or a Hollywood event.
* Slut Cut, in which Rivers and the panelist dishes on celebrities choosing to cut their dresses shorter than the original runway length. (until 2010)
* Starlet or Streetwalker, in which a photograph of a person with their face obscured is presented, often the person in question will sport revealing or disheveled clothing. Rivers and the panelists have a paddle with &quot;Starlet&quot; written on one side and &quot;Streetwalker&quot; on the other. They then take turns guessing which of the two they think the person in the photo may be, before their identity—or lack thereof—is revealed.
* Guess Me from Behind, where the hosts guess a celebrity based solely from their behind.
*360 Degree Glam Cam, a specialty segment during E! Entertainment&#x27;s, &quot;Live from the Red Carpet&quot;. There is a dedicated platform for celebrities pose, while a camera is rotated in a full circle around them in order to capture the entirely of the celebrity wardrobe. This gives both the audience and the hosts of Fashion Police optimal coverage of the outfit. (Began in 2009)

New segments from March 9, 2012, along with an all-new hour of truth of &quot;Fashion Police&quot;:
* Look Who&#x27;s Trending, a weekly segment where the hosts talk about the latest celebrities&#x27; fashion dishes, news, and/or trends, majoritically from Twitter.
* Ad Sanity, in which the hosts guess and talk about a celebrity ad based on one thing, &quot;What do they want to tell &amp; sell in ad?&quot;.
* Fan Find, in which the hosts talk about one picture that is sent from the &quot;Fashion Police&quot; fans via Twitter with #FanFind.

==Criticism==

===Writers&#x27; wages controversy===
In early April 2013, writers for the show complained to the state of California, alleging that the network was breaking state law by not compensating them for regular wages and overtime. According to the writers, their paychecks state that they worked eight hours each week, regardless of their actual working time. In response to the complaint, the network said &quot;E! values our &quot;Fashion Police&quot; writers and we pay them fairly and in full legal compliance.&quot; On April 13, the writers at the show went on strike.

===Zendaya controversy===
On February 27, 2015, E! confirmed Osbourne&#x27;s exit, citing her decision to &quot;pursue other opportunities&quot;. However, days earlier, Osbourne had tweeted that she was upset and was questioning whether she would stay with the show, following jokes made by Rancic concerning singer and Disney Channel star Zendaya, in reference to her hair smelling of &quot;patchouli oil&quot; and &quot;weed&quot; at the 87th Academy Awards. She also tweeted: &quot;you guys do realize that @Zendaya is my friend right?&quot;. On March 12, 2015, it was announced that Griffin would also be departing the series after only seven episodes. Griffin cited that she felt her style of humor &quot;did not fit well&quot; with the series&#x27; creative direction. The network announced in March 2015 their decision to keep the series on hiatus until September 2015, in order to revamp the series with new panelists.

<text>Lysander (; ; 454 BC – 395 BC) was a Spartan military and political leader. He destroyed the Athenian fleet at the Battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC, forcing Athens to capitulate and bringing the Peloponnesian War to an end. He then played a key role in Sparta&#x27;s domination of Greece for the next decade until his death at the Battle of Haliartus.

Lysander&#x27;s vision for Sparta differed from most Spartans; he wanted to overthrow the Athenian Empire and replace it with Spartan hegemony.

==Early life==
Little is known of Lysander&#x27;s early life. His year of birth is estimated at 454 BC. Some ancient authors record that his mother was a helot or slave. Lysander&#x27;s father was Aristocritus, who was a member of the Spartan Heracleidae; that is, he claimed descent from Heracles but was not a member of a royal family. According to Plutarch, Lysander grew up in poverty and showed himself obedient, conformed to norms, and had a &quot;manly spirit&quot;.

It was custom in the Spartan upbringing for a young adult to be assigned as the &quot;inspirer&quot; (&quot;eispnelas&quot;) or &quot;lover&quot; (&quot;erastes&quot;) of an adolescent, and Lysander was matched in this role with the future king Agesilaus, the younger son of Archidamus II. Nothing is known of Lysander&#x27;s actual career before he was elected, in 408 BC, to Sparta&#x27;s annual office of admiral, to conduct the long-running Peloponnesian War against Athens.

== Admiral ==

From Gythium on the eastern shore of the Peloponnese, Lysander set out with 30 triremes. He sailed to Rhodes, where he collected some more ships, and made his way to Cos, Miletus, Chios, gathering ships, until he finally arrived at Ephesus, which he turned into the Peloponnesian League&#x27;s main naval base for the Aegean. His arrival was shortly followed by that of Cyrus, young son of the Persian king Darius, who had been appointed by his father as governor of the provinces of Asia Minor in response to an earlier Spartan embassy requesting increased aid in the war against Athens. Lysander promptly went to meet Cyrus at his headquarters in nearby Sardis, and with calculated deference made a deep impression on the young prince, developing with him a close friendship that was to have a decisive effect in the course of the war. Cyrus began funding Sparta&#x27;s war effort on a large scale, and was encouraged to increase the pay of Lysander&#x27;s crews from three to four obols, increasing their morale and Lysander&#x27;s popularity among them. Once back in Ephesus, Lysander summoned a conference of influential oligarchs from all over the Greek cities in the Aegean, encouraged them to organize into political clubs (&quot;hetaireiai&quot;), and promised to put them in power in their respective cities in the event of Athens&#x27; defeat. In doing so, Lysander created in effect a network of clients who were loyal to him personally and contributed to Sparta&#x27;s war effort with increased eagerness.
As Lysander was fitting out his vessels at Ephesus, an Athenian fleet roughly the size of his own, led by the famous Alcibiades, set up anchor at the nearby port of Notium. At first, the Spartan was content to refuse battle and let his higher wages, funded by Cyrus, encourage desertions among the enemy crews. Eventually, however, one of the Athenian officers, despite orders to stay put, was drawn into a fight with an advance party of Peloponnesian ships. Lysander gave a timely order for his entire fleet to advance, and drove off the intruder before they had properly deployed for battle, inflicting modest losses. Alcibiades, who had been away on urgent business, returned upon hearing of this setback and again offered battle off Ephesus, but Lysander once more refused, and the Athenians had to withdraw.

However, Lysander ceased to be the Spartan navarch after this victory and, in accordance with the Spartan law, was replaced by Callicratidas. Callicratidas&#x27; ability to continue the war at sea was neatly sabotaged when Lysander returned all the donated funds to Cyrus when he left office.

== Vice-admiral ==
After Callicratidas was defeated and killed at the Battle of Arginusae, Cyrus and the oligarchic clubs which Lysander had sponsored all sent embassies to Sparta requesting the former admiral&#x27;s return to command. The Spartan government consented, a sign of confidence in his ability and an endorsement of his policy of supporting oligarchies in the Greek cities. As Spartan law did not allow an admiral to hold office twice, Lysander was instead appointed the secretary (&quot;epistoleus&quot;) or second-in-command to Callicratidas&#x27;s eventual successor, Aracus, with the understanding that the latter would allow Lysander to take the lead. Making his base at Ephesus again, the Spartan began gathering and rebuilding the remnants of the Peloponnesian fleet in the Aegean, once again with the full cooperation of his Greek allies and Cyrus. In the meantime, Lysander visited Miletus, an ally of Sparta, and deceitfully massacred some leading democrats during the festival of Dionysus in early 405 BC to place his own adherents in power; replacing Miletus&#x27; democracy with an Oligarchy. In the summer, Lysander&#x27;s principal benefactor, Cyrus, was summoned to the deathbed of his father, the King, and, before departing, took the extraordinary step of entrusting the Spartan with his entire treasury and with the revenues from the Persian-ruled cities under his administration.

Lysander finally set sail with some 125–150 ships, and among his early actions, which are variously reported by the sources, were the massacre and enslavement of the population of Iasus and Cedreae, allies of Athens. He continued toward the Hellespont to threaten the route of grain transports to Athens from the Black Sea, forcing the Athenians to send their fleet, 180 ships, in pursuit. Lysander set up anchor at Lampsacus and plundered it, while the Athenians took up a position at Aegospotami in the opposing shore of the straits. For several days Lysander refused battle, studying the opponent&#x27;s moves, until, during a moment of enemy carelessness, he surprised the Athenians and captured most of their vessels as they were still ashore and unmanned. The entire Athenian fleet was gone, and Sparta had finally won the Peloponnesian War.

Now in full command of the seas, Lysander began touring the Aegean to receive the surrender of enemy strongholds, ordering all captured Athenian garrisons and cleruchs (colonists) home in order to overcrowd the city and hasten its surrender through famine. In many Greek cities, he installed ten-man governing boards (decarchies) whose members were selected from the oligarchic clubs he had sponsored earlier, supported and supervised by a Spartan harmost (military governor). Democrats and other opponents of his narrow oligarchies were often massacred or banished. In a propaganda gesture he restored places like Aegina, Melos and Scione to populations whom the Athenians had forcibly uprooted throughout the course of the war.

Following an unsuccessful attempt to bring about Athens&#x27;s surrender with a show of force off Attica in autumn 405 BC, Lysander began establishing contacts with Athenian oligarchic exiles and sponsored their return to the city as one of the conditions for peace, which was finally concluded in spring 404 BC. Lysander received the surrender of the last of Athens&#x27;s allies, Samos, in the summer of 404 BC, after which he went in person to Athens in response to an appeal by Athenian oligarchs. On the anniversary of the Battle of Salamis, Lysander sailed into the Piraeus, ordered the razing of Athens&#x27;s city walls and the burning of its fleet, and sent for female flautists from the city to play music as the deed was carried out. He also oversaw a meeting of the Athenian assembly which effectively abolished Athens&#x27;s democracy and replaced it with a governing board of thirty oligarchs (the Thirty Tyrants).

== Command in Athens ==

After storming and seizing Samos, Lysander returned to Sparta. Alcibiades, the former Athenian leader, emerged after the Spartan victory at Aegospotami and took refuge in Phrygia, northwestern Asia Minor with Pharnabazus, its Persian satrap. He sought Persian assistance for the Athenians. However, the Spartans decided that Alcibiades must be removed and Lysander, with the help of Pharnabazus, arranged the assassination of Alcibiades.

Lysander amassed a huge fortune from his victories against the Athenians and brought the riches home to Sparta. For centuries the possession of money was illegal in Lacedaemonia, but the newly minted navy required funds and Persia could not be trusted to maintain financial support. Roman historian Plutarch strongly condemns Lysander&#x27;s introduction of money; despite being publicly held, he argues its mere presence corrupted rank-and-file Spartans who witnessed their government&#x27;s newfound value for it. Corruption quickly followed; while general Gylippus ferried treasure home, he embezzled a great amount and was condemned to death in absentia.

==Resistance by Athens==
The Athenian general Thrasybulus, who had been exiled from Athens by the Spartans&#x27; puppet government, led the democratic resistance to the new oligarchic government. In 403 BC, he commanded a small force of exiles that invaded Attica and, in successive battles, defeated first a Spartan garrison and then the forces of the oligarchic government (which included Lysander) in the Battle of Munychia. The leader of the Thirty Tyrants, Critias, was killed in the battle.

The Battle of Piraeus was then fought between Athenian exiles who had defeated the government of the Thirty Tyrants and occupied Piraeus and a Spartan force sent to combat them. In the battle, the Spartans defeated the exiles, despite their stiff resistance. Despite opposition from Lysander, after the battle Pausanias the Agiad King of Sparta, arranged a settlement between the two parties which allowed the re-establishment of democratic government in Athens.

==Final years==
Lysander still had influence in Sparta despite his setbacks in Athens. He was able to persuade the Spartans to select Agesilaus II, his younger lover, as the new Eurypontid Spartan king following the death of Agis II, and to persuade the Spartans to support Cyrus the Younger in his unsuccessful rebellion against his older brother, Artaxerxes II of Persia.

Hoping to restore the juntas of oligarchic partisans that he had put in place after the defeat of the Athenians in 404 BC, Lysander arranged for Agesilaus II, the Eurypontid Spartan king, to take command of the Greeks against Persia in 396 BC. The Spartans had been called on by the Ionians to assist them against the Persian King Artaxerxes II. Lysander was arguably hoping to receive command of the Spartan forces not joining the campaign. However, Agesilaus had become resentful of Lysander&#x27;s power and influence. So Agesilaus frustrated the plans of his former mentor and left Lysander in command of the troops in the Hellespont, far from Sparta and mainland Greece.

Back in Sparta by 395 BC, Lysander was instrumental in starting a war with Thebes and other Greek cities, which came to be known as the Corinthian War. The Spartans prepared to send out an army against this new alliance of Athens, Thebes, Corinth and Argos (with the backing of the Achaemenid Empire) and ordered Agesilaus to return to Greece. Agesilaus set out for Sparta with his troops, crossing the Hellespont and marching west through Thrace.

==Death==

The Spartans arranged for two armies, one under Lysander and the other under Pausanias of Sparta, to rendezvous at and attack the city of Haliartus in Boeotia. Lysander arrived before Pausanias and persuaded the city of Orchomenus to revolt from the Boeotian League. He then advanced to Haliartus with his troops. In the Battle of Haliartus, Lysander was killed after bringing his forces too near to the walls of the city.

Following Lysander&#x27;s death, Agesilaus II &quot;discovered&quot; an abortive scheme by Lysander to increase his power by making the Spartan kingships collective and that the Spartan king should not automatically be given the leadership of the army. There is argument amongst historians as to whether this was an invention to discredit Lysander after his death. However, in the view of Nigel Kennell, the plot fits with what we know of Lysander.

==Legacy==
Lysander is one of the main protagonists of the history of Greece by Xenophon, a contemporary. For other (later) sources he remains an ambiguous figure. For instance, while the Roman biographer Cornelius Nepos charges him with &quot;cruelty and perfidy&quot;, Lysander – according to Xenophon – nonetheless spared the population of captured Greek poleis such as Lampsacus.

The Westland Lysander aircraft was named after him.

===Commemoration===
According to Duris of Samos, Lysander was the first Greek to whom the cities erected altars and sacrificed to him as to a god and the Samians voted that their festival of Hera should be called Lysandreia. He was also the first Greek who had songs of triumph written about him.

===Sayings attributed to Lysander===
* &quot;Where the lion&#x27;s skin does not reach, it must be patched with the fox&#x27;s&quot;.
* He boasted about cheating &quot;boys with knuckle-bones and men with oaths&quot;.

<text>Filippina Lydia &quot;Tina&quot; Arena (born 1 November 1967) is an Australian singer-songwriter, musician, musical theatre actress and record producer. She is one of Australia&#x27;s highest-selling artists and has sold over 10 million records worldwide. Arena is multilingual, singing and recording in English, Italian, French and Spanish.

Arena has earned several international and national awards, including a BRIT Award, seven ARIA Awards and two World Music Awards for Best-selling Australian Artist (1996, 2000). In 2001, she was awarded a BMI Foundation Songwriting Award (Broadcast Music Inc) by the American performance rights organisation for co-writing &quot;Burn&quot; with Pam Reswick and Steve Werfel. In 2011, Arena became the first Australian to be awarded a knighthood of the French National Order of National Merit, presented by the President of the French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy, for her contributions to French culture, and ceremonially awarded by Frédéric Mitterrand, the Minister of Culture and Communication of France.

In 2015, Arena was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association ARIA Hall of Fame. On Australia Day, 26 January 2016, Arena was recognised in the Australia Day Honours and appointed a member in the General Division of the Order of Australia &quot;for significant service to the music industry as a singer, songwriter, and recording artist, and as a supporter of charitable groups&quot;. In 2016 Arena was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM).

In March 2019, the Government of Australia appointed Arena as a board member of the Australia Council for the Arts for a three-year term.

== Life and career ==
=== 1967–1987: Early life and career beginnings ===
Arena was born in the Melbourne suburb of Keilor East, to Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Arena and Francesca &quot;Franca&quot; Catalfamo (both from Valguarnera, Sicily), Sicilian immigrants, in Melbourne on 1 November 1967. Giuseppe was a rural worker in Sicily and then a cane cutter in Cairns in 1955. By the following year he was a labourer in Melbourne and later worked for Victorian Railways. Arena grew up in Keilor East, Victoria with two sisters, Nancy and Silvana; As a child, she listened to Spanish, Italian and French songs that were in her family&#x27;s record collection. At the age of six, she was the flower girl at her cousin Gaetano&#x27;s wedding, and at the reception she urged her father to approach the host so that she could sing—Daryl Braithwaite&#x27;s version of &quot;You&#x27;re My World&quot;—it was her first public performance.

Arena&#x27;s family call her Pina, which is her shortened first name. She changed her first name from Filippina to &quot;Tina&quot;, her stage name becoming &quot;Tina Arena&quot;, when she appeared as a child performer on the national television talent show &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; in 1976, at age 8. For secondary schooling, she attended a Catholic girls&#x27; college, St. Columba&#x27;s College, Essendon, in Melbourne. Recalling her upbringing, Arena says, &quot;It was a very Italian household, it was a very traditional household. There was a lot of love but there was a lot of discipline. And there was no room for pretentiousness. Really, there just wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

===&quot;Young Talent Time&quot; years===
Arena received singing lessons from Voila Ritchie who recommended her to appear on a television talent quest and variety show, &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;, an Australian weekly television variety program produced by Lewis-Young Productions and screened on Network Ten.

When Arena was selected to appear on &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; in 1974, the producers at Lewis-Young Productions and Network Ten asked her to change her first name from Filippina to &quot;Tina&quot;—creating her stage name, &quot;Tina Arena&quot;—so as to be more relatable to the wider national audience. In the mid-1970s, there was a minority of ethnic diversity represented in the Australian mainstream media, especially on primetime television. Initially appearing as a &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; contestant in 1974, Arena went on to permanently join the cast as a regular member of the show&#x27;s Young Talent Team in 1976. She then quickly, and affectionately, became known on the show by her nickname &quot;Tiny Tina&quot;. For her first appearance she performed ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Ring Ring&quot;.

As a core member of the Young Talent Team performing live on Australian national television each week, Arena sang cover versions of popular music tracks. In 1977, she released a split album, &quot;Tiny Tina and Little John&quot;, alternating tracks with fellow Young Talent Team member, John Bowles.

As a member of the Young Talent Team, Arena appeared in TV specials, in TV commercials, at shopping centres and on tourist venues. In September 1982, she became a &quot;coach&quot; for new team members, Danielle Minogue and Mark McCormack; Arena told &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;″s Debbie Byrne that &quot;They seem to be settling down a lot quicker than I did. They both have a really professional attitude.&quot; At 14, she told Byrne &quot;my aim: to be a recording artist and actress but, now, I have to concentrate simply on what I&#x27;m doing and that can take enough effort.&quot;

Arena left the &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; show in October 1983, ahead of her 16th birthday, due to the Network Ten &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; series age-limit contract stipulation to give way for younger members. Arena performed the songs &quot;The Way We Were&quot; and &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; for her finale set on her farewell &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; episode. Arena starred in &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; from 1976 to 1983—making her the show&#x27;s longest-serving cast member.

Arena completed her Higher School Certificate (final year of secondary school) and was hired as an insurance clerk; however, she resigned after three months to pursue a music career.

Speaking at her BIGSOUND keynote address in 2017, Arena described her childhood to teenage experience on &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; as an inclusive apprenticeship into the television light-entertainment and musical industry in Australia, Arena noted:

It was 40 years ago and there were no ethnic faces on [Australian] television. It was an extraordinary apprenticeship. Young Talent Time was inclusive and welcoming. The only downside of Young Talent Time was when I was trying to transition to an adult.

===Starting a solo recording career===
At age 17, Arena signed a record deal with Graffiti Records, which released her debut single, &quot;Turn Up the Beat&quot;, in 1985. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described it as having a &quot;dance-pop&quot; style. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s Tim Elliott said that it &quot;failed to impress&quot;. It had been recorded in the previous year with Brian Cadd producing at Flagstaff Studios in Melbourne. When the single did not appear in the top 50 her planned album was scrapped.

Following her 1985 recording, Arena sang advertising jingles and worked on the pub and club circuit to earn a living. She performed solo shows and in bands, including as a member of a nine-piece ensemble, Network. She also appeared in musicals. In 1987, she supported American artist Lionel Richie on his Australian tour following a number of charity performances.

=== 1988–1993: Debut solo album – &quot;Strong as Steel&quot; ===
During 1988, Arena appeared as a guest on Australian TV shows recalling her tenure on &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; and looking for a new record label. In 1990, she had a singing and dancing role in the David Atkins&#x27; musical, &quot;Dynamite&quot;, for a 10-month run. Also that year she signed with EMI and reinvented her image as a raunchy disco diva. In April she issued a single, &quot;I Need Your Body&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Singles Chart. McFarlane described it as &quot;uptempo&quot; with the associated music video &quot;projecting a raunchy disco-diva persona ... flaunting a pouting rock starlet with bouncing cleavage and attitude to burn.&quot; Australian journalist Ed Nimmervoll noticed that she used &quot;raunchy videos showing off her cleavage as if to prove she was a woman now.&quot;

The artist followed with another single, &quot;The Machine&#x27;s Breaking Down&quot;, in July 1990, which peaked in the top 30. Her debut solo album, &quot;Strong as Steel&quot;, was released in October, and peaked at number 17 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Most of the album was produced by Ross Inglis. Penelope Layland of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; opined that &quot;the frantic single, &#x27;I Need Your Body&#x27;, is quite uncharacteristic of much of the music on Tina Arena&#x27;s album, &quot;Strong As Steel&quot;. In fact, it is one of the weakest tracks on an album which bounces with potential pop hits.&quot;

According to music historian Ed Nimmervoll, Arena &quot;was not comfortable. This was not her. This was not what she wanted to be for the rest of her life. Tina went into seclusion while she decided what to do next, moving to Los Angeles to be a nobody again.&quot; She relocated to LA in 1991, where she took more singing lessons and started songwriting. Upon return to Australia, in 1993, she performed in the local December 1992 to February 1993 musical theatre production, &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, as the Narrator, at the State Theatre, Melbourne. In 1992 Arena sang background vocals on the debut album by Australian singer-songwriter Rick Price, titled &quot;Heaven Knows&quot;, which was released in July 1992, and she appeared in the 1993 music video by Price for the single &quot;A House Divided&quot;.

===1994–1996: Second solo album – &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;===

Arena&#x27;s second solo studio album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;, was released on 14 November 1994. It was produced by David Tyson for Columbia Records. According to Nimmervoll, during recording &quot;Tina nearly broke down. This was an all-important moment in her career.&quot; Arena co-wrote all 10 tracks of the original Australian version.

Ian McFarlane noticed it demonstrated a &quot;more mature, sophisticated, soul-tinged style and approach ... [and] her powerful, crystal clear voice more than adequately matched the material on offer.&quot; Kelvin Hayes of AllMusic felt that &quot;a lot of &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot; remains twee. However, there are good moments.&quot; It peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart—a year after its release—and remained in the top 50 for 83 weeks. It reached No. 11 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 12 in New Zealand.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot; was the highest-selling album of 1995 in Australia and one of the biggest-selling albums by an Australian female singer to date. It has sold over two million copies worldwide and was certified 10 times platinum by ARIA in 2011 for shipment of over 700,000 copies in that country alone. The success of the record made her a &quot;priority artist&quot; for Sony, who marketed her in the US. Her European success was realised: &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot; charted in Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.

The lead single, &quot;Chains&quot;, was issued ahead of the album in August 1994 and peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It also reached No. 6 in the UK, No. 7 in New Zealand, No. 9 in Ireland, No. 38 in the U.S., and No. 20 in Canada. In 1995, she toured Europe, appearing on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; which broadcast to an audience of 60 million people. In the European market Arena was an unknown and a fresh commodity, she opined: &quot;I loved every minute of that—of people not knowing who I was. I guess it was tiring fighting the individual thing. It was good to not be a part of a past and being accepted as an artist. Not having to carry this &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; luggage which was constantly shoved in my face.&quot; Five additional singles were released, &quot;Sorrento Moon (I Remember)&quot; (January 1995), &quot;Heaven Help My Heart&quot; (May), &quot;Wasn&#x27;t It Good&quot; (September), &quot;Show Me Heaven&quot; (November) and &quot;That&#x27;s the Way a Woman Feels&quot; (February 1996).

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, Arena was nominated in six categories and won four trophies: Best Pop Release and Song of the Year for &quot;Chains&quot;; and Album of the Year and Best Female Artist for &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;. At the 1996 ceremony she received five more nominations and won Highest Selling Album for &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;. Other accolades she earned were Variety Club Entertainer of the Year, an Advance Australia Foundation award, and a World Music Award.

===1997–2000: &quot;In Deep&quot; and the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games===
Arena relocated to Los Angeles in 1996 and 1997, to record her third solo studio album, &quot;In Deep&quot; (18 August 1997), which became her second number-one album in Australia. For the Australian version of the album Arena co-wrote eleven of its twelve tracks—her fellow writers include Mick Jones (of Foreigner), David Tyson, Christopher Ward, Dean McTaggart, Pam Reswick and Steve Werfel. The album included her cover version of Foreigner&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, originally written by Jones who produced Arena&#x27;s version. &quot;In Deep&quot; &quot;was recorded predominantly live in the studio in an attempt to bring the material closer to Tina&#x27;s stage performance persona&quot; with four tracks produced by Tyson and the rest by Jones. &quot;In Deep&quot; was certified 3× platinum in Australia. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic found the US version of the album showed that &quot;Her own songs, co-written with a team of others, are perfectly good contemporary pop/rock, and she sings them with passionate commitment&quot; and it was &quot;brimming with potential hit singles (it spawned three in Australia).&quot;

&quot;In Deep&quot;, in its different versions, provided ten singles, with the lead one, &quot;Burn&quot;, appearing in July 1997, which had some US airplay. The track was co-written by Arena with Reswick and Werfel. In Australia it debuted at No. 2 and was certified gold upon its release. It was also a hit in Asia. Besides the English-language version she also recorded it in Spanish and Italian (in the form of &quot;Ti Voglio Qui&quot;). The second single, &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Love You&quot; (November) appeared in the ARIA top 50. In April of the following year she issued &quot;Now I Can Dance&quot;, which peaked at No. 13. In the UK Arena released &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; (June 1998) as a cover version single, it was the title track from the 1996 musical of the same name, her version reached the UK Singles Chart top 30.

In April 1998, Arena performed at the 50th birthday celebration for Andrew Lloyd Webber at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Arena performed at the celebration, along with John Farnham, and featured musical performances by Elaine Paige.

Arena&#x27;s duet with US artist, Marc Anthony, &quot;I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You&quot;, from the feature film soundtrack for &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (July 1998), gained her European chart success. The track was issued as a non-album single in Australia in September, but did not reach the top 50. It was included on the French release version of &quot;In Deep&quot;, appearing in October, which peaked at No. 3 on the French Albums Chart—a year after its first entry—and spent 88 weeks on that chart. It also reached the top 10 in Belgium and top 40 in Switzerland. It was certified 3× platinum by Syndicat National de l&#x27;Édition Phonographique (SNEP) in May 2001 for sales in France. &quot;I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You&quot; had been issued in Europe in September 1998, it peaked at No. 3 in France—her first charting single in that market. It also reached No. 3 in the Netherlands and top 10 in Belgium.

Arena toured the US from March 1999, to promote the album&#x27;s local release, as well as another single, &quot;If I Was a River&quot;, which did peak in the UK top 40. Sony attempted to &quot;break&quot; Arena into the US market by the release of &quot;If I Was a River&quot;, penned by Diane Warren. Ruhlmann felt the label had an &quot;obvious plan is to turn her into a down-under Celine Dion&quot; however the album and its singles &quot;had no commercial impact upon release in the U.S.&quot; and &quot;must be considered a disappointment.&quot; Her US foray included appearances on TV shows such as &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;. In February 1999, she teamed with label-mate Donna Summer to perform a cover version of &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot;; the duet appeared on Summer&#x27;s live album, &quot;Live &amp; More Encore&quot; (June 1999).

Arena&#x27;s first French-language single, &quot;Aller plus haut&quot; (English: &quot;Go Higher&quot;, July 1999), appeared on the continental version of &quot;In Deep&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 on the local singles chart. It also became her first number-one hit on the Belgian Singles Chart. Her second French-language single was a cover version of &quot;Les trois cloches&quot; (English: &quot;The Three Bells&quot;, January 2000), which reached No. 4 in France and another number-one hit in Belgium. From May that year she lived in London while she appeared in the lead role of Esméralda for the stage musical, &quot;Notre Dame de Paris&quot; during a six-month run. Carr, by now her ex-husband, had claimed in &quot;Business Review Weekly&quot; (2000) that Arena was paid $200,000 per week when she was performing in &quot;Notre Dame de Paris&quot;.

Arena sang &quot;The Flame&quot; (written by John Foreman) at the 2000 Opening Ceremony of the Sydney Olympics on 15 September. Seven Network covered the national broadcast across Australia, which become the highest rating TV telecast in Australian history. John Farnham, Olivia Newton-John, Vanessa Amorosi, Human Nature and Julie Anthony were some of the other Australian artists who appeared at the opening ceremony and contributed to the various artists&#x27; album, &quot;The Games of the XXVII Olympiad: Official Music from the Opening Ceremony&quot; (September 2000). She recalled, &quot;When I sang at the Olympics, I cared about the fact that I was Australian. And I was touched because I was an ethnic girl, of ethnic blood but that WAS Australian. Because I was born here, this is where I grew up, this is where I learned everything.&quot;

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000 in October, Arena received an Outstanding Achievement Award. In the following month she issued her first compilation album, &quot;Souvenirs&quot;, which reached the ARIA top 40.

===2001–2007: &quot;Just Me&quot;, &quot;Never (Past Tense)&quot; and &quot;Un autre univers&quot;===
Arena&#x27;s fourth solo studio album, &quot;Just Me&quot;, was released on 12 November 2001 and debuted at No. 7 in Australia; it reached the top 50 in France and top 70 in Switzerland. She co-wrote tracks with Nile Rodgers (Madonna, Diana Ross), Desmond Child (Ricky Martin, Aerosmith), Robbie Nevil (Earth, Wind &amp; Fire), Mark Hudson (Eric Clapton, Cher), Victoria Shaw and Peter-John Vettese (Dido, Paul McCartney). The album explored different genres, containing more upbeat tracks as opposed to her two previous studio records which featured her soprano voice on slow pop ballads. Although written after the divorce from Carr, she said that the record is not angry nor bitter but rather a &quot;celebration of womanhood&quot;. It was certified gold by ARIA and by SNEP (France).

To promote &quot;Just Me&quot; she showcased it for 150 people, mostly Australian TV and media personalities, in Melbourne. The record provided four singles including &quot;Symphony of Life&quot; (September 2002), which peaked at No. 8 in Australia and top 50 (as &quot;Symphonie de l&#x27;âme&quot;) in France. In November 2008 she performed the track at the closing of the Gay Games, when the international sporting event was held in Sydney. She was featured on &quot;2&quot; (November 2002), a duets album from Olivia Newton-John for which the pair recorded an uptempo track, &quot;I&#x27;ll Come Runnin&#x27;&quot;.

In March 2002, Arena posed for a semi-nude photo shoot by James Houston for &quot;Black+White&quot; magazine. She explained, &quot;This shoot isn&#x27;t about shock value, and it&#x27;s not porn, it&#x27;s an elegant, understated and honest exercise in challenging my sexuality and learning to love myself again.&quot; She appeared in &quot;Cabaret&quot; in August that year in Sydney in the lead role of Sally Bowles.

In April 2003, Arena and US electronica group, Roc Project, released a dance music single &quot;Never (Past Tense)&quot;, which reached number 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Airplay Chart in October 2003. The single included seven house and electronic dance music remixed versions by various DJs. This was the first time three performers associated with &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; were simultaneously in the chart&#x27;s Top 10 with Dannii Minogue&#x27;s &quot;I Begin to Wonder&quot; and Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Slow&quot; also appearing on the chart.

&quot;Never (Past Tense)&quot; was used on the US TV series, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, and on its associated soundtrack album (2003). The singer-songwriter performed the Tiësto remix with a new remix of &quot;Dare You to Be Happy&quot; live at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras after party in March 2005. By 2014 she had performed at the Mardi Gras for a fourth time: she is one of the gay icons of this generation.

In October 2004, Arena released &quot;Greatest Hits 1994–2004&quot;, her second compilation album, which peaked at No. 10 in Australia. The compilation provided a newly recorded track as a single, &quot;Italian Love Song&quot; (November), which reached the top 40. After its release she left the recording label, striking a new deal with Sony Music BMG, France. She embarked on an Australian national tour in late 2004 to early 2005, to support the album.

Her debut French-language album, &quot;Un autre univers&quot; was released in December 2005, and gained a platinum certificate from SNEP in February 2006, it peaked at No. 9 on the French charts and remained for 78 weeks.

&quot;Un autre univers&quot; lead single, &quot;Aimer jusqu&#x27;à l&#x27;impossible&quot; which peaked at No. 3 on the French charts, in November 2005, and stayed in the top 5 for over 10 weeks. The single was her biggest French hit to date on the French national charts In February 2006, the single achieved platinum sales in France. The single peaked at No. 1 in Belgium and was a top 20 hit in Switzerland. The song received an award for Song of the Year in France. A second single &quot;Je m&#x27;appelle Bagdad&quot; was released in June 2006, peaking at No. 6 in France and No. 8 in Belgium. The third and final single from the album, &quot;Tu aurais dû me dire (Oser parler d&#x27;amour)&quot; (English: &quot;You Should Have Told Me (Dare to Speak of Love)&quot;), was issued in October.

Arena toured France, including two concerts at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin in Paris. She performed her French hits and some of her Australian repertoire. In July, she appeared on &quot;The Footy Show&quot; where she performed, with fellow Australian singer Kane Alexander, direct from Munich&#x27;s Prince Regent&#x27;s Theatre.

In 2006, she appeared on various European TV shows to promote the album and has appeared in Night of the Proms, &quot;Star Academy&quot;, Fête de la Musique, Les Enfoirés and the NRJ Music Awards where she performed her single, &quot;Aimer jusqu&#x27;à l&#x27;impossible&quot; (English: &quot;Love Even the Impossible&quot;, November 2005) backed by her French contemporaries: Anggun, Leslie Bourgoin, Amel Bent, Nâdiya, Lââm and Natasha St-Pier.

===2007–2009: &quot;Songs of Love and Loss&quot; 1 and 2===
Arena returned to the London stage in April 2007, starring as Roxie Hart in the West End production of &quot;Chicago&quot;, at the Cambridge Theatre, West End of London. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that, &quot;Arena is returning to the stage following the birth of her first baby, Gabriel, now aged 13 months. Arena will make her debut at the prestigious Cambridge Theatre in Covent Garden in April playing the infamous murderess who exploits the media to escape prosecution. Arena said she was &quot;excited, if not a little daunted&quot; about playing the role, which means Arena will have to dust off her dancing shoes for toe-tappers such as &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; and &quot;All That Jazz&quot;.&quot;

In 2007, Arena&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Songs of Love &amp; Loss&quot;, was recorded independently and self-financed as she no longer had a recording contract in Australia. The album was issued on 1 December 2007 after a new deal was struck with EMI. It has torch songs, originally recorded by women in the 1960s and 1970s, including by Dusty Springfield and Diana Ross, and the arrangements featured a full string orchestra conducted by Simon Hale. A promotional tour of Australia, in early November, included appearances on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and &quot;Sunrise&quot;. Five concert dates backed by a 35-piece orchestra were held over December to January: three at the Sydney Opera House and two at Melbourne&#x27;s Hamer Hall. The album peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart; at the ARIA Music Awards of 2008 it was nominated for Best Selling Album.

While Arena was promoting &quot;Songs of Love &amp; Loss&quot; in Australia in 2008, she shot a music video in and around Sydney for her next French-language single, &quot;Entends-tu le monde?&quot; (English: &quot;Do you hear the world?&quot;), was made available to French radio and music TV channels. It appeared on her second French-language album, &quot;7 vies&quot; (28 January 2008), which debuted at No. 12 on the official French charts, her highest debut in the country. &quot;Entends-tu le monde?&quot; was physically released in February and debuted at No. 10 on the French charts, becoming her sixth top 10 single in that market.
In August 2008, Arena performed with Andrea Bocelli during his Australian tour. The two performed duets of &quot;The Prayer&quot;, &quot;Canto della Terra&quot; and a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot;. Prior to the tour she had been in the UK recording her eighth studio album, &quot;Songs of Love &amp; Loss 2&quot;, it was released on 15 November 2008, and reached No. 12 in Australia. For this album, her vocals were recorded live with the London Studio Orchestra, again conducted by Hale. On 27 August 2008, alongside fellow Australian singer and songwriter Darren Hayes, Arena appeared as a guest judge during the London auditions of the sixth season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;. She appeared again as a guest judge, on 16 November, while she was in Australia to promote, &quot;Songs of Love &amp; Loss 2&quot;.

In March 2009, Arena toured Australia and appeared as a guest performer at the Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras party singing a medley of &quot;Aimer jusqu&#x27;à l&#x27;impossible&quot; and &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot;, accompanied by Alison Jiear on the latter. She travelled to South Australia to co-headline with US musician, Chris Isaak, at Barossa Under the Stars, an outdoors concert. Also in March 2009 her first French-language compilation album, &quot;The Best &amp; le meilleur&quot; (English: &quot;The Best &amp; the best&quot;), was released. &quot;The Peel Me Sessions&quot;, an album of original material recorded in 2003, was also officially released in May 2009.

===2010–2011: French National Order of Merit and &quot;Tour de France&quot; ===
In January 2010, Arena and Irish singer Ronan Keating (of Boyzone) were co-headliners for an outdoor concert festival, A Day on the Green, at Swan Valley. The duo performed tracks from their latest respective albums and were supported by &quot;Australian Idol&quot; season 4 winner, Damien Leith.

In January 2010, Arena released a live CD and DVD in Australia titled &quot;&quot; The album peaked at No. 22 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The live recording was her eighth Top 10 album on the ARIA Australian-only artist chart and was also promoted and sold during Arena and Keating&#x27;s concerts.

On 24 July 2011, Arena sang an &quot;a cappella&quot; performance of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; on the podium on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées at the &quot;Tour de France&quot; winner&#x27;s ceremony after Cadel Evans became the first Australian winner in the tour&#x27;s history. This was unscheduled and came about because Arena was living in Paris at the time and offered her services only hours before the ceremony. It was the first time in the tour&#x27;s history that a national anthem was performed live on the podium in front of huge crowds and a broadcast audience of millions.

In 2011, Arena was a judge on the French version of &quot;The Sing-Off&quot; TV singing competition program, alongside two other judges, French singer Michel Jonasz, and French artistic director of radio and television Nathalie André. The program was broadcast on France 2.

In 2011, Arena became the first Australian to be awarded a knighthood of the French National Order of National Merit, presented by the President of the French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy, for her contributions to French culture, and ceremonially awarded by Frédéric Mitterrand, the Minister of Culture and Communication of France.

===2012: &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; revival and Australian symphony orchestra tour===
Arena appeared as a judge on the 2012 version of &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; in Australia, 29 years after her final regular appearance on the original series. After judging the talent shows, she finished her national Australian tour backed by various Australian symphony orchestras with Anthony Callea as a special guest. Arena detailed working on the tour: &quot;They are precious, those moments where the orchestra swells behind you, they are difficult to describe in words and from an adrenalin perspective it is a sensational feeling.&quot; In November 2012, she issued her fourth live album released on CD and DVD, &quot;Symphony of Life&quot;, recorded at one of her Melbourne concerts. Arena&#x27;s management is Beebox.

===2013–2014: &quot;Reset&quot;, &quot;Now I Can Dance&quot; and &quot;Dancing with the Stars Australia&quot;===
Due to the success of her Symphony of Life Tour, Arena added five extra shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra for February and March 2013, as part of her Encore Concerts. In July she performed two concerts at the Queensland Music Festival. One of these was a solo show backed by the Queensland Youth Orchestra performing her own hits and covers; and the other was with local artists, Christine Anu, Anthony Callea, Rick Price and Katie Noonan paying tribute to the Bee Gees.

Arena released her first English-language solo studio album in eleven years, &quot;Reset&quot;, on 18 October 2013, which peaked at No. 4 and became her sixth Top 10 album in Australia. It was released in both standard and a deluxe editions (with three extra tracks). It was certified gold in three weeks and then platinum in December 2013. Its lead single, &quot;You Set Fire to My Life&quot; (September), included both studio and acoustic versions; as well as three official remixes by Cosmic Dawn, The Slips and 7th Heaven—it reached the ARIA top 40. The track &quot;Only Lonely&quot; featured in Channel 7&#x27;s &quot;Home and Away&quot; promo, which also reached the top 40. Also in October 2013 Arena published her autobiography, &quot;Now I Can Dance&quot;, written with Jude McGee, to coincide with the release of &quot;Reset&quot; and is now on its 4th reprint.

Arena performed at the &quot;G&#x27;Day USA Los Angeles Black Tie Gala&quot; on 11 January 2014. On 14 March 2014, Arena appeared on &quot;Sunrise&quot; and performed &quot;You Set Fire to My Life&quot;. Also in March, Arena appeared on &quot;So You Think You Can Dance Australia&quot; to perform her single, &quot;Reset All&quot; (December 2013), which was accompanied by a routine from two previous winners of the series, Jack Chambers and Talia Fowler.

===2015–2017: &quot;Eleven&quot;, ARIA Hall of Fame and Australia Day honours===
In May 2015, Arena issued &quot;Songs of Love &amp; Loss&quot; in France. Her eleventh studio album, &quot;Eleven&quot;, was released on 30 October 2015. It was preceded in September by its lead single, &quot;I Want to Love You&quot;. Arena premiered the single by performing on the live television show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; on 4 September 2015.

Arena&#x27;s album &quot;Eleven&quot; is so named because it is the 11th album of her recording career, but also because she likes its astrological implications, 11 being a figure of enlightenment and artistic sensitivity. Like its predecessor, 2013&#x27;s &quot;Reset&quot;, &quot;Eleven&quot;is a pop-heavy collection featuring songwriting collaborations with, among others, Kate Miller-Heidke, Hayley Warner and Evermore&#x27;s Jon Hume. The album was recorded in Sydney, Melbourne, London and Stockholm, as well as in Paris. The &quot;Eleven&quot; album is a mix of atmospheric electronica (Unravel Me, Overload), smouldering anthems (Wouldn&#x27;t Be Love If It Didn&#x27;t, Love Falls, Not Still in Love with You) and dance-friendly pop (Magic). Arena&#x27;s most recent release, &quot;Eleven&quot;, became her seventh Top 10 album in Australia by debuting at No. 2 on the ARIA album chart in November 2016, and is now certified gold.

In September 2015, Arena hosted shows on SmoothFM Radio Stations from 4:00 pm every Saturday on Sydney&#x27;s SmoothFM 93.5 and on Melbourne&#x27;s SmoothFM 91.5.

On 25 October 2015, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) announced that Arena was due to be inducted into their Hall of Fame in the annual awards ceremony in November as a member of the Australian music industry ARIA Hall of Fame. In mid-November ARIA announced that she would be inducted by Australian-British singer and actress Kylie Minogue, also a Hall of Fame inductee—and the sister of singer Dannii Minogue, a former &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; contestant. Arena looks forward to enjoying the acknowledgment of her peers at the Australian music industry&#x27;s gala celebration on 26 November 2015. She is quick to point out that receiving the honour doesn&#x27;t mean she is entering the twilight of her career. &quot;It&#x27;s not the end,&quot; she says, &quot;Not yet&quot;, adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t have another 40 years in me, I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to last, but I&#x27;m touched by the recognition. It will be an emotional night&quot;. On 26 November 2015, Arena was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame at the 2015 ARIA Awards ceremony.

During Arena&#x27;s Hall of Fame ceremony induction on 26 November 2015, fellow Australian singer Kylie Minogue—also a Hall of Fame inductee—paid tribute to Arena by stating, &quot;I remember being blown away when she sang &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; on &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;, and I tried countless times to try and sing that song the way she did it and couldn&#x27;t do it. She has the pipes. She could teach us all a lesson.&quot; This was a nod to Arena&#x27;s entire career, as one of the Australia&#x27;s highest-selling female artists, and her childhood fame on &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; from 1976 to 1983—making her the show&#x27;s longest-serving cast member.

Speaking with MOZA Music in a January 2019 interview, Arena stated that:

One of my favourite moments was the Arias hall of fame induction in 2015. For myself that moment meant that I could speak freely about the industry, which I obviously love, but feel that there are far too many inequalities. Also the sheer volume of music that is made available to people makes it difficult to financially exist.

On Australia Day, 26 January 2016, Arena was recognised in the &quot;Australia Day Honours&quot;, which the country&#x27;s sovereign awards its citizens for actions or deeds that benefit the nation. Arena has been appointed as a Member in the General Division of the Order of Australia—Order of Australia—in recognition of her contribution to the arts, representing Australia on the world stage and philanthropic work.

On 27 September 2016, Arena performed at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus in Athens, Greece, as a special guest of Greek singer George Perris.
On 9 December 2016, Arena, in her capacity as the official ambassador, launched the &#x27;Versailles: Treasures From The Palace&#x27; exhibition at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA), located in Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory. The exhibit, which is said to be the most elaborate ever put on by the NGA, features 130 priceless works of 18th century of art flown to Australia from France.

On Australia Day, 26 January 2017, at the &quot;Australia Day Concert: Live at The Sydney Opera House&quot;, Arena joined a collection of Australia&#x27;s best talent, including Guy Sebastian, Human Nature, Dami Im, children&#x27;s group The Wiggles, and others, performing contemporary tunes and tributes to the great songs of Australia&#x27;s past. The 2017 Australia Day Concert was a free public event, organised by the NSW Government through its tourism and major events agency. Arena, as one of Australia&#x27;s most accomplished performers, with a career spanning several decades, said prior to the event, &quot;Australia Day is a great opportunity to come out, eat some delicious food, listen to some amazing music and take part in the diversity that defines our country&quot; and &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to be part of the day—to stand in the middle of the harbour, to sing with the harbour crowds and school choir, and give my own version of a salute to Australia&quot;.

In April 2017, Arena released her fifth compilation double album titled, &quot;Greatest Hits &amp; Interpretations&quot;, released by EMI Music Australia. The album is a 2-CD set—the first contains 17 of Arena&#x27;s hits; the second is an album of interpretations.The interpretations disc includes a duet with Dannii Minogue, singing with Arena for the first time since &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;.

Arena announced her &quot;Innocence to Understanding Tour&quot; in conjunction with the release of her &quot;Greatest Hits &amp; Interpretations&quot;, starting in Brisbane on Wednesday, 6 September 2017, and concluding in early October. The title of the tour is a telling nod to her career journey, one of only a few artists who has been able to live four decades in music.

In early May 2017, Arena released her first fragrance, after working three years on the project, called &quot;Renaissance&quot; developed with Bertrand Duchaufour, one of the world&#x27;s leading perfumers in Paris. Bertrand have come up with a high-quality Eau De Parfum combining ingredients sourced from Arena&#x27;s three cultures: France, Italy and Australia, including sandalwood from Indigenous Australia.

In June 2017, Arena featured as the portraiture guest on the Australian TV series &quot;Anh Do&#x27;s Brush with Fame&quot; aired on ABC. Arena shared journey from child star to international artist the challenges and sacrifices that have shaped her. Anh Do is a Vietnamese-born Australian author, actor, comedian, and artist. He was three-times a finalist in the annual Archibald Prize art award.

In September 2017, Arena featured as a keynote speaker at the Australian BIGSOUND Musical Conference. Now in its seventeenth year, BIGSOUND attracts more than 6,000 music fans and industry gurus who attend the event at Fortitude Valley, Queensland, for the more than 130 artists across 18 venues over three nights. Arena&#x27;s keynote speech shared her experience and her advice for the changing face of the music industry, having been at the forefront of the Australian music scene for 40 years.

===2018: &quot;Quand tout Recommence&quot;===
After almost a decade away, Arena made a return to French pop music with a new 2018 French-language album, &quot;Quand tout Recommence&quot; (translates to: &quot;When Everything Restarts&quot;), set for an April release, to the francophone music market (primarily France) and also reaching audiences in Belgium and Sweden. &quot;Quand tout Recommence&quot; is Arena&#x27;s third French-language studio album, and her twelfth studio album overall, since her francophone album, &quot;7 vies&quot;, released in January 2008, which debuted at No. 12 on the official French charts; her highest debut in France.

The album title &quot;Quand tout Recommence&quot; translates to &quot;When Everything Restarts&quot;. Arena has stated that when she records in the French language, she is careful not to record French versions of her English-language hits, as lyric meanings in French and English differ. Arena notes that too often the intention of the song gets &quot;lost in translation&quot;, therefore she has always chosen to write in both languages.

On 17 November 2017, Arena released on digital preview platforms a new song recording, &quot;Tant que tu es là&quot; (translates as &quot;As long as you&#x27;re around&quot;), as the lead single for &quot;Quand tout Recommence&quot;.

In an April 2018 interview with &quot;Webmedia SAS Pure Charts&quot; (France), Arena defined what pulled her into the French Pop music after a decade away, recording and performing in her homeland Australia and in selective international showcase tours, Arena explains, &quot;I wanted to re-do music in French. Everything started from there with this project. The desire&quot;. She is motivated by the desire to reconnect with the success of her French Pop hits, &quot;Go higher&quot; and &quot;Love to the impossible&quot;. On her 2018 &quot;Quand tout Recommence&quot; album, Arena offers ten new songs recorded in the language of Molière, &quot;L&#x27;ombre de ma voix&quot; (Translates to: The Shadow of My Voice&quot;). The contents of songs on the record is quite varied. Recalling her former residency in French Pop Music, yet, her inaugural entry on the French Music Charts was in 1998, and was her first French platinum record. Arena concludes, &quot;&quot;I miss the connection with the French public. It was time. With all that happened.&quot; Good, is what happens with Arena, and France.

On 16 February 2018, Arena released on digital preview platforms the next single, &quot;L&#x27;ombre de ma voix&quot; (&quot;The Shadow of My Voice&quot;), from her new album &quot;Quand tout Recommence&quot;.

On 6 April 2018, the new French-language album, &quot;Quand tout Recommence&quot; was released on the francophone market, with the album peaking on the French album chart Top 150 at No.62, and also peaking on the Belgium album chart at No.46. The two single releases and the complete album, &quot;Quand tout recommence&quot;, are now available to download and stream worldwide.

===2018: &quot;L&#x27;ombre de ma voix&quot; music video===
An accompanying official music video for &quot;L&#x27;ombre de ma voix&quot; (&quot;The Shadow of My Voice&quot;), was released on 16 February 2018. The music video director is Michael Westbrook with production by Positive Dream Réalisation.

The video thematically delivers a nostalgic mood, as Arena traces her 40-year career in the music industry, showing a montage of video footage and TV clips across her lifespan as a live performer. Capturing the visual evolution of Arena&#x27;s artistry, beginning in 1974 for the then-eight-year-old child performer on &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;.

In the &quot;Quand tout Recommence&quot; music video, Arena appears multiple times in every frame, and it doubles and triples; Arena is seen as the artist she is today, in the recording studio, and throughout the footage of clips revolving around her, as she is evolving through her career. The montage chronicles Arena&#x27;s childhood, and adolescence, to womanhood—including childhood piano lessons, roller-skating, backstage rehearsals, signing autographs with fans, to singing live at the Sydney Olympic Games 2000, and more. Clearly, Tina Arena has always got to work, sung her heart out and in again, and she keeps working. The song title, &quot;The Shadow of My Voice&quot;, makes a report on 40 years her a career, composed of ups and downs, and mixes childhood images, live performances, and studio sessions. The opportunity is taken by the Australian to prove that she is still active and far from relying on her previous success.

===2018–present===
In January 2018, Arena performed as part of the live-music program at the Australian Open 2018 Grand Slam tennis tournament at Melbourne Park.

In February 2018, Arena featured as the portrait guest in an episode of the Australian TV series &quot;Anh Do&#x27;s Brush with Fame&quot; with comedian and artist Anh Do, on the ABC network. Arena shared her journey from child star to international artist, reflecting on the challenges and sacrifices that have shaped her.

In March 2019, the Government of Australia appointed Arena as a board member of the Australia Council for the Arts for a three-year term. The council, informally known as the Australia Council, is the principal arts council or arts funding body of the federal government. The federal arts minister, Mitch Fifield, released a statement that Arena will be a welcome influence, &quot;The high-profile singer-songwriter, musician and musical theatre actor brings significant experience as an artist to the board.&quot;

In May 2019, Arena was awarded the perennial Excellence in Community Award by the Australian Music in the House organisation. The award was presented at Support Act Limited&#x27;s annual Music in the House event. The award recognises &quot;members of the music industry who, by their tireless efforts and charitable works, have made a difference and enriched the fabric of the broader Australian community&quot;.

In June 2019, Arena was nominated in the category of Best Female Actor in a Musical at the annual Helpmann Awards for her lead role performance as Eva Perón in &quot;Evita&quot;. She was nominated alongside Luisa Scrofani, Natalie Abbott and Ursula Yovich. The award was won by Yovich for &quot;Barbara and the Camp Dogs&quot;.

On 6 September 2019, Arena appeared as a guest performer and speaker with indigenous Australian artist Deborah Cheetham, a soprano, actor, composer and playwright, at the 2019 Melbourne Writers Festival. The two artists spoke about how music shapes them.

Arena performed at the Sydney Coliseum Opening Week opening program in December 2019. Originally launched as the Western Sydney Performing Arts, the Sydney Coliseum Theatre, West H.Q.

In December 2019, Arena performed at the Good Things music festival. Arena will join the festival line-up as a cameo guest artist, along with Lisa and Jessica Origliasso of the Veronicas.

Arena filmed a supporting role, as Rosalba, in the Australian film &quot;Promised&quot; (2019), directed and co-produced by Nick Conidi. She co-stars with Paul Mercurio, Antoniette Iesue and Daniel Berini.
In 2023, Arena appeared as Plante Carnivore (Carnivorous Plant) on &quot;Mask Singer&quot;, the French version of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;.

===2018 &quot;Evita&quot;: Australian tour production===
The Opera Australia 2018 national tour, &quot;Evita&quot;, was the 40th-anniversary restaging of the original Harold Prince production. Prince&#x27;s production won seven Tony Awards when it moved to Broadway after originally opening in London&#x27;s West End, and it became the template for subsequent productions of the musical for the following quarter of a century. The musical charts Eva Perón&#x27;s life from an ambitious teenager, through her career as the First Lady of Argentina from 1946, until her death in 1952 at the age of 33. It includes some of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice&#x27;s best known material, including &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;.

====Casting====
On 21 August 2017, Opera Australia announced that Arena would be taking on the lead role of Eva Perón in the 2018 Australian touring production of &quot;Evita&quot;. The tour opened at Sydney Opera House, in the Joan Sutherland Theatre, on 13 September 2018, with the season running to 3 November 2018. It subsequently moved to the Arts Centre Melbourne from 5 to 30 December 2018. Arena said that she was &quot;terrified&quot;, but described the role as &quot;a precious gift for myself and for any female performer&quot;. She said that she felt &quot;blessed to work with someone who has had the kind of career that Hal Prince has had&quot;. Arena also says she felt the time was right to tackle the role: &quot;I have been approached to do this role on a couple of occasions. I never felt emotionally ready for it. I felt I had a lot of living and learning before I could get up and take on the enormity of the story and the human spirit she possessed.&quot; Arena expressed of knowing about Eva Perón since she was a little girl, and feeling privileged to be able to recount the story and embrace the complex role.

On 7 May 2018, Opera Australia&#x27;s artistic director, Lyndon Terracini, along with producers John Frost and David Ian, announced the full cast for the upcoming Australian production of &quot;Evita&quot;. With Arena announced in the lead role as Eva Perón, the remainder of the cast was announced as: Paulo Szot, Brazilian operatic baritone, and winner of a Tony Award for best actor on Broadway 2008, in the role of Juan Perón; Kurt Kansley (The Lion King, Rent, Godspell, Show Boat) will take on the role of the revolutionary Che Guevara. Michael Falzon (We Will Rock You, Jesus Christ Superstar, Chess) will portray tango singer Agustín Magaldi, while the role of Perón&#x27;s Mistress will be played by Alexis van Maanen. Jemma Rix (WICKED, The Wizard of Oz) has been cast as the alternate Eva Perón and is currently scheduled to be appearing in the role at least once a week throughout the Sydney season, according to the Evita-Australia website.

On 21 July 2018, Terracini, along with producers John Frost and David Ian, announced the 18 young performers who have been cast in the upcoming production of &quot;Evita&quot;, in season at the Sydney Opera House from September 2018. Three sets of six children will alternate in ensemble roles.

====Arena on Eva Perón====
In taking on the titular role of Eva Perón in &quot;Evita&quot; for Opera Australia, Arena commented to the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Limelight&quot; magazine that she was &quot;terrified&quot;, but described the role as &quot;a precious gift for myself and for any female performer&quot;. She said that she felt &quot;blessed to work with someone who has had the kind of career that Hal Prince has had&quot;. Arena also notes that she felt the time was right to tackle the role:

I have been approached to do this role on a couple of occasions. I never felt emotionally ready for it. I felt I had a lot of living and learning before I could get up and take on the enormity of the story and the human spirit she possessed. I don&#x27;t think I was ready in my 30s to play Eva Perón at all. Playing the role of Eva Perón at 50, is much more suited to the life experience that I have had.

Arena talked of knowing about Perón since she was a girl and about feeling privileged to recount the story and embrace the complex role.

====Opening night: Sydney Opera House====
The official opening night of the &quot;Evita&quot; at the Sydney Opera House was on 13 September 2018. &quot;Evita&#x27;s&quot; lyricist, Sir Tim Rice, attended, having travelled to Australia for the event a week after joining the EGOT winners club. Arena received a prolonged standing ovation for the portrayal as Eva Perón. Sydney&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;Arena soars in a sublime performance of the First Lady of Argentina. Even those who don&#x27;t know the musical &quot;Evita&quot;, are probably familiar with the song &#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&#x27; and it was at this point on opening night that Arena really powered into her own as Eva Perón.&quot;

====National tour: Arts Centre Melbourne====
The Victorian tour leg of the &quot;Evita&quot; tour was at the State Theatre at the Arts Centre Melbourne in December 2018.

In February 2019, it was reported that the production had become the highest selling show ever staged at the State Theatre. Claire Spencer, CEO of the Arts Centre Melbourne, noted that &quot;It is fantastic to have such an accomplished cast, including cherished global star Tina Arena perform Evita at Arts Centre Melbourne. Tina is particularly close to our hearts as one of the &#x27;Patrons of the Australian Music Vault&#x27; at Arts Centre Melbourne.&quot;

====Critical reception====
On 19 September 2018, the ABC&#x27;s classical music and arts magazine &quot;Limelight&quot;&#x27;s theatre reviewer, Angus McPherson, gave a four-star review of &quot;Evita&quot; at the Sydney Opera House. The review, &quot;Evita – Tina Arena gives us a vocally high flying Evita in Hal Prince&#x27;s original production&quot;, stated that, &quot;The role of the tough, ambitious, Evita isn&#x27;t an easy sing, and it comes with baggage—anyone taking it on is walking in the footsteps of the likes of Elaine Paige, Patti LuPone and Madonna (in the 1996 film with Antonio Banderas)—but Arena proves herself more than equal to the vocal demands. She doesn&#x27;t have the heavy belt of a LuPone, but she&#x27;s got a deliciously sultry low register and she handles the lighter high notes with confidence, letting rip when it&#x27;s called for—her rallying oration in &#x27;A New Argentina&#x27;, buoyed by the chorus, is a rousing finale to the show&#x27;s first act. Brazilian opera singer Paulo Szot, brings a magisterial baritone to Juan Perón. Arena comes into her own in the second act, with highlights including the show&#x27;s hit Don&#x27;t Cry For Me Argentina (in quite a broad rendition), as well as Rainbow High, Waltz for Eva and Che and You Must Love Me—which was written for Madonna in the film and inserted here, Arena alone onstage, &#x27;in concert&#x27; style. The show ends on a sombre note, and if Evita&#x27;s final moments don&#x27;t quite hit home emotionally, her assumption of power is thrillingly done, Arena&#x27;s vocals capturing her commanding power and charisma.&quot;

On 19 September 2018, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; theatre reviewer, Joyce Morgan, gave a four-star review of &quot;Evita&quot;. The review, &quot;Evita review: Don&#x27;t cry for Tina Arena&#x27;s timely Eva&quot;, states that &quot;What you do get is a show with renewed currency about the rise and demise of one of Latin America&#x27;s most intriguing and controversial figures, Eva Peron. You also get a woman at the height of her musical powers in the show-stopper scene as Tina Arena, in the title role, steps regally along the presidential balcony to deliver with melting clarity and conviction the anthemic &#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&#x27;. In this 40th-anniversary restaging of the original Harold Prince production, the misogyny, sexism and patronising disdain by the powerful forces arrayed against our heroine takes the breath away. Not least because some of the abuse seems as current as that excreted by social media trolls. Rice&#x27;s lyrics still pack a punch.&quot;

On 20 September 2018, &quot;The Guardian&quot; musicals reviewer, Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore, gave a four-star review of &quot;Evita&quot;. The review, &quot;Tina Arena is Resplendent and Tough as Designer Dictator&quot;, stated that &quot;In Opera Australia&#x27;s production, Eva Perón wins over a nation with a Christian Dior dress and steely determination, and a killer ballad steals the show. At the centre of it all is Evita, played with a resplendent toughness by Arena. It is to her credit that in a few hours she can turn from a naive, if plucky, teenager eager to leave her poor upbringing behind to a grown woman ravaged by illness and yet still desperate to cling to the last vestiges of power. The score stands the test of time too, Under director Harold Prince&#x27;s deft hands, the song, &#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&#x27;, shows its true colours: it is designed as a master class in political manipulation.&quot;

In February 2019, it was reported that the production had become the highest selling show ever staged at the State Theatre, Arts Centre Melbourne. Claire Spencer, the Arts Centre Melbourne CEO, said that &quot;It is fantastic to have such an accomplished cast, including cherished global star Tina Arena perform Evita at Arts Centre Melbourne. Tina is particularly close to our hearts as one of the Patrons of the Australian Music Vault at Arts Centre Melbourne.&quot;

On 2 May 2019, &quot;Limelight&quot; reported that Opera Australia published its annual report for 2018, stating that &quot;Opera Australia posts a (AU)$5.6 million profit for 2018.&quot; Details published that &quot;overall attendance was 543,498 from 637 total performances, with the numbers bolstered by the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Seasons of the musical &quot;Evita&quot; in Sydney and Melbourne led the charge in 2018, followed by the Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour production of &quot;La bohème&quot;.&quot;

In June 2019, Arena was nominated in the category of Best Female Actor in a Musical at the annual Helpmann Awards for her role as Eva Perón in &quot;Evita&quot;. Arena was nominated alongside Luisa Scrofani, Natalie Abbott, and Ursula Yovich. The award was won by Yovich for &quot;Barbara and the Camp Dogs&quot;.

==Artistry==
Arena possesses the vocal range of a soprano. She is multilingual: she speaks and sings in English, Italian and French; and also sings in Spanish. Her singing style is characterised as between R&amp;B and ballad.

Numerous media and musical contemporaries have praised Arena&#x27;s skill as a world-class singer. Music journalist Ed Nimmervoll commented that Arena &quot;has a voice that can give you goosebumps&quot;, while news journalist Kate de Brito says that it is &quot;smooth and musical even when she talks.&quot; Cameron Adams of the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; says she has a &quot;beautiful voice telling a beautiful story.&quot; William Yeoman of &quot;The West Australian&quot; commented that &quot;Arena&#x27;s voice is redolent of both youthful pop and mature cabaret.&quot; The Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s monthly classical music and arts magazine, &quot;Limelight&quot;, commented that, &quot;Tina Arena is a performer with a supreme voice, boundless range and energy, and charm to spare.&quot; Kelsey Munro of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; says that her voice is &quot;strong, smooth and pitch-perfect.&quot; According to Heidi Maier of &quot;Tom&quot; magazine, it can be described as &quot;remarkably strong&quot;. She also said, &quot;Tina Arena has a powerhouse voice and when she hits her marks, she hits them with forcefulness and verve.&quot; Spiritworks Australia says, &quot;Whether she&#x27;s singing spine-tingling renditions of contemporary classics by Lulu, Dusty Springfield or Blondie or her self-penned hits Sorrento Moon, Chains or Burn, Tina Arena is acclaimed as one of the world&#x27;s most versatile and magnificent vocal interpreters. Her voice is smooth, rich and streaming with emotion.&quot;

The Queensland Music Festival team says, &quot;Tina sparkles with vivacity and class, possessing an outstanding vocal range and a voice that belies her petite stature—endlessly powerful and always resonant with heart and honesty.&quot; Queensland Music Festival artistic director, James Morrison said &quot;Tina Arena has one of the most amazing voices I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot; Time Out magazine had a brief description of Tina&#x27;s voice as it says, &quot;Tina Arena truly boasts two incredible assets—her voice and her versatility ...&quot; Melbourne&#x27;s 89.9 Light FM declared that Arena is &quot;undisputedly one of Australia&#x27;s finest voices&quot;. Sharyn Hamey, an online music reviewer says that &quot;Arena has an angelic, beautiful and a powerful voice.&quot;

Fellow Australian celebrities have praised Arena&#x27;s vocal prowess with Delta Goodrem saying, &quot;Her voice has strength whilst keeping its feminine warmth to draw you in.&quot; Melbourne singer-songwriter, Michael Paynter hailed Arena as &quot;simultaneously the most natural and supernatural female Australian voice ever. She is technically and emotionally perfect, but somehow always has enough of a sniff of imperfection and rawness to make you not only believe every word, but be hanging off them too.&quot; Ricki-Lee Coulter also says that &quot;She has so much control and power&quot;. Missy Higgins also commented that, &quot;Tina Arena is one of our best singers ever. She could sing the balls off anyone, and she&#x27;s miniature.&quot; Brian Mannix says, &quot;Tina Arena has a tasteful voice. She sells the lyrics with her big voice but never over-sings.&quot; Birds of Tokyo frontman Ian Kenny says, &quot;Tina Arena can sing the shit out of anything, and do it in four different languages!&quot; Anthony Callea added, &quot;Technically, she is faultless and her tone is unique and warm. I love that she goes against all the &#x27;singers&#x27; rules&#x27;—I&#x27;ve seen what she eats and drinks before a gig!&quot; Darren Hayes also made an effort in letting the public know that Arena&#x27;s voice is one of his favourite voices in Australia through Twitter.

Arena records songs and albums in English, French, Italian and Spanish. She has stated that she does not record French versions of her English-language popular hits, because too often the intention of the song gets &quot;lost in translation&quot;; therefore, she has always chosen to write in both languages.

Arena&#x27;s musical influences include Barbra Streisand, Carole King, Dusty Springfield, Petula Clark, Aretha Franklin and various Italian singers. She has noted that in a non-musical perspective, Princess Diana inspired her and called her &quot;a great role model for women&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Arena&#x27;s tracks have been covered by country music artists, including Wynonna Judd (&quot;Heaven Help My Heart&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot;), Jo Dee Messina (&quot;Burn&quot;), Pam Tillis (&quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Love You&quot;), Terri Clark (&quot;Unsung Hero&quot;), Kellie Coffey, Kathie Baillie (&quot;Love&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot;) and LeAnn Rimes (&quot;You Made Me Find Myself&quot;).

Younger artists have covered Arena&#x27;s songs in singing competitions, such as the winner of the second season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, Casey Donovan, who recorded Arena&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Life&quot; for her album &quot;For You&quot; and both Filipino artist Sarah Geronimo and Australian Anthony Callea, who admits to being a fan of Arena&#x27;s, recorded &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; including the bridge that was written specifically for Arena&#x27;s version. Sarah De Bono who came in at fourth place when she joined &quot;The Voice Australia&quot; also recorded Arena&#x27;s &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Love You.&quot; Filipino artists Nina and Christian Bautista recorded a duet version of &quot;Burn&quot; that appeared on Nina&#x27;s album &quot;Nina Live!&quot; while Regine Velasquez did a live performance on Philippine television. Erik Santos and Sheryn Regis also recorded their version of Arena and Marc Anthony&#x27;s duet, &quot;I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You&quot;.

In 2001, Arena was awarded a BMI Foundation Songwriting Award (Broadcast Music Inc.) by the American performance rights organisation for co-writing &quot;Burn&quot; with Pam Reswick and Steve Werfel.

In April 2013, Arena was voted Australia&#x27;s all-time greatest female singer and third greatest singer overall in an industry poll conducted by Australian music journalist, Cameron Adams, for the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;. As of July 2014, Arena has sold over 10 million records worldwide.

In 2015, Arena was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association ARIA Hall of Fame at the 2015 ARIA Awards ceremony.

In the 2016 Australia Day Honours, Arena was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in recognition of her contribution to the arts, representing Australia on the world stage and philanthropic work.

==Personal life==
During her career, Arena has lived in the United States, France and the United Kingdom.

In December 1995, Arena married her then-manager, Ralph Carr, who had been her manager since 1992. Their divorce was finalised in 1999, while they settled their financial and contractual matters in February 2002.

In the late 1990s, Arena relocated from Australia to live in Paris, France. In 2000, Arena met the French artist Vincent Mancini with whom she has a son, Gabriel Joseph Mancini, born in 2005.

In 2012, Arena and her family moved from Paris to Melbourne, Victoria. With her partner Vincent Mancini and their son, she moved back, full-time, at the end of October 2012, after almost two decades living in France and London.

In 2019, Arena stated to MOZA Music, &quot;I&#x27;ve been fortunate to have been around the pre-digital world. My story&#x27;s unique, I&#x27;m aware of that and don&#x27;t take it for granted. How do I define success? I define it by the fact that I&#x27;m still around; and that I&#x27;ve managed to survive&quot;.

Arena has been a supporter of female artists in the music industry, particularly celebrating the long-term careers of mature women artists. Arena believes we should embrace and celebrate ageing and not fall victim to ageism—especially in the music industry where mature women are not seen as viable or relevant.

To the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Arena described herself as somebody with &quot;certain points on the board&quot;—someone who has been &quot;tenacious, resilient, hung around for a long time&quot; and &quot;done everything in their power to hone their craft&quot;. It is from the place—as one of Australia&#x27;s great musical dames—that she makes abrasive critiques of what constitutes a career in music today. &quot;I&#x27;ve struggled with the phantasmal aspect that has been a part of what we do&quot; she says. &quot;The fact that it has been really glamourised, glorified, also dumbed down as well.&quot; Thus, she argues that the music industry has been peddling shoddy wares, saying &quot;It&#x27;s a business template they&#x27;ve used. They&#x27;ve told people that you can be a star and sold that dream to everybody. I think it&#x27;s been a huge irresponsibility&quot;.

In December 2016, in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; video series &quot;Her Sound, Her Story: Tina Arena&quot;, she discusses how the music industry squanders women as both they and their careers mature. &quot;You&#x27;ve got to give me a really damn good reason why somebody, who is in the prime of their career and are doing really good work, why on earth they should stop? Are you going to tell a male who is at the top of his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?&quot;. Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says &quot;Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams.&quot;

===Time&#x27;s Up movement and the Australian music industry===
In December 2017, Arena joined over 600 high-profile female artists from the Australian music industry, including Missy Higgins and the Veronicas, Sarah Blasko and Jenny Morris, in signing an open letter called &quot;#MeNoMore&quot; demanding change in the music industry, in support of Time&#x27;s Up to fight workplace sexual harassment and assault. The authors of the open Letter state they are motivated to organise the letter as an Australian response to the #MeToo campaign movement triggered by the accounts of sexual abuse in the wider entertainment industry. Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group responded with words of support.

Following the January 2018 creation of US Time&#x27;s Up campaign by a collective of Hollywood female artists to fight workplace sexual harassment and assault, Arena joined with more than 30 high-profile women from the Australian media and entertainment industries—including Deborah Mailman, Sarah Blasko and Danielle Cormack—to spearhead a new national organisation, NOW Australia, led by broadcaster Tracey Spicer, to tackle sexual harassment, abuse and assault in workplaces across Australia. On Twitter, the Australian #MeToo campaign has encouraged stories of workplace harassment and assault following her public call-out on Twitter in October 2017.

In March 2018, in support of the Time&#x27;s Up and #MeToo campaigns, Arena authored an op-ed article titled &quot;The music industry must join us with #thetimeisNOW&quot;, published by News Corp Australia. Arena state her views on how the Australian music industry has enabled &quot;a stagnant perspective towards females&quot;. Arena stated future social goals in the op-ed, that &quot;We need to raise the bar of our emotional intelligence because this is not a whinge, it&#x27;s not a social media trend, and NOW Australia is going to keep the issue of sexual harassment at the forefront and do everything we possibly can to change the mentality that allows it to happen. We&#x27;ve got a lot of work to do here.&quot;

===Anti-lockdown sentiments===
In September 2021, Arena appeared on Australian daytime television program Studio 10 to highlight the disparity between the art community and sporting events in relation to COVID-19. During this interview, she advocated that the arts sector should no longer support charitable causes and that Victorian lockdowns should be ended. Arena cited as her reasons in the interview the double standards in how the arts and sports are treated, as large scale music events are cancelled &quot;but never the footy match&quot; and her belief that no one wants to help out the artistic community after &quot;the artistic community has done what they needed to do and always rolled up our sleeves&quot;.

== Memoir ==
Arena&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Now I Can Dance&quot;, published by HarperCollins, was released on 14 October 2013, in hardback, paperback and E-book format. Arena authoured her memoir with co-writer Jude McGee. The text is billed by HarperCollins as &quot;Honest and intimate, funny and frank, &quot;Now I Can Dance&quot; is the long-awaited memoir from the very special, much-loved singer, songwriter and pop diva, Tina Arena.&quot; She told Kathy McCabe of News Corp Australia that &quot;I don&#x27;t need to put a book out to put food on the table. It started to dawn on me in the last year that I have had an unbelievable life and I want people to know it&#x27;s been hilarious, there&#x27;s been a lot of laughter in my journey.&quot; Publisher: HarperCollins Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd (14 October 2013).

The title of her memoir is taken from the third single, &quot;Now I Can Dance&quot;, from Arena&#x27;s third studio album &quot;In Deep&quot; (1997). The track was written by Arena while living in L.A. and is a love letter from her to her family, as she explained in her memoir. The song was successful in her native Australia, reaching No. 13 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation shop describe Tina Arena&#x27;s memoir as an &quot;honest, gritty, funny, frank and totally revealing memoir from much loved songstress Tina Arena, who is about to celebrate a phenomenally successful 40 years as a singer-songwriter.&quot;

HarperCollins said &quot;Tina has amassed a cache of amazing stories. The artist who gave us &quot;Chains&quot;, &quot;Sorrento Moon&quot; and &quot;Symphony of Life&quot; has sold eight million albums, won a swag of awards, encountered extraordinary people, fallen in and out of love, and experienced incredible highs and lows.&quot;

In 2017, Arena updated her memoir with the release of a new edition of &quot;Now I Can Dance&quot; with new content covering her relocation from France back to Australia, being inducted into the 2015 ARIA Hall of Fame, the release of new music, and new musical ventures.

== Charities ==
Arena has used her fame to help several causes and is a patron to two charities in Australia: child protection organisation Barnardos and Soldier On which supports rehabilitation for veterans. In her support she is an official patron for a charitable organisation Soldier On, which assists mentally and physically wounded Australian soldiers. Arena said, &quot;It&#x27;s vital that Australian soldiers have access to support when they return from overseas, and &#x27;Soldier On&#x27; will make a much needed difference in the lives of wounded veterans and their families. &#x27;Soldier On&#x27; is the first charity of its kind in Australia and I am honoured to be a Patron.&quot;

In July 2013, Arena performed at the Melbourne Asbestos Cancer Fundraiser, which donated funds raised to support Mesothelioma research undertaken at the Olivia-Newton John Cancer &amp; Wellness Centre and the Austin Hospital, Melbourne. She was also a participant, with partner Damian Whitewood, in the 13th Australian season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; which commenced in September 2013 and nominated Barnardos Australia as her charity; the pair finished in third place.

Arena took part in Australia&#x27;s biggest TV charity appeal, &quot;Telethon&quot;, in Perth on 20 October 2013. On 21 December 2013 she opened Sydney&#x27;s annual Carols in the Domain concert with &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot; and performed her single &quot;Reset All&quot; at the closing of the event. She has also performed at several benefit concerts, including Live 8 in Paris and for Queensland Flood Relief in 2013.

In November 2014, Arena released a cover version of 10cc&#x27;s 1976 song &quot;The Things We Do For Love&quot;, with funds raised going towards the National Breast Cancer Foundation.

Arena, reflecting on nearly 40 years in the music industry, relates all of her achievements back to her Australian beginnings: &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t for Australia, I would never have been able to have been catapulted internationally and to have done the things that I&#x27;ve been able to do. It was because of Australia that I&#x27;ve done that&quot;. she told AAP, in 2013.

In May 2019, Arena was awarded the perennial &quot;Excellence in Community Award&quot; by the Australian Music in the House Organisation. The award was presented at Support Act Limited&#x27;s annual Music in the House event on 29 May 2019. The award recognises &quot;members of the music industry who, by their tireless efforts and charitable works, have made a difference and enriched the fabric of the broader Australian community&quot;.

<text>Saturday is the day of the week between Friday and Sunday. No later than the 2nd century, the Romans named Saturday (&quot;Saturn&#x27;s Day&quot;) for the god Saturn. His planet, Saturn, controlled the first hour of that day, according to Vettius Valens. The day&#x27;s name was introduced into West Germanic languages and is recorded in the Low German languages such as Middle Low German , &quot;saterdach&quot;, Middle Dutch (Modern Dutch ), and Old English , &quot;Sæterndæġ&quot; or .

==Origins==

Between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, the Roman Empire gradually replaced the eight-day Roman nundinal cycle with the seven-day week. The astrological order of the days was explained by Vettius Valens and Dio Cassius (and Chaucer gave the same explanation in his &quot;Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot;). According to these authors, it was a principle of astrology that the heavenly bodies presided, in succession, over the hours of the day. The association of the weekdays with the respective deities is thus indirect, the days are named for the planets, which were in turn named for the deities.

The Germanic peoples adapted the system introduced by the Romans but glossed their indigenous gods over the Roman deities in a process known as &quot;interpretatio germanica&quot;. In the case of Saturday, however, the Roman name was borrowed directly by West Germanic peoples, apparently because none of the Germanic gods was considered to be a counterpart of the Roman god Saturn. Otherwise Old Norse and Old High German did not borrow the name of the Roman god (Icelandic , German ).

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saturdays are days on which the Theotokos (Mother of God) and All Saints are commemorated, and the day on which prayers for the dead are especially offered, in remembrance that it was on a Saturday that Jesus lay dead in the tomb. The Octoechos contains hymns on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Saturdays throughout the year. At the end of services on Saturday, the dismissal begins with the words: &quot;May Christ our True God, through the intercessions of his most-pure Mother, of the holy, glorious and right victorious Martyrs, of our reverend and God-bearing Fathers…&quot;. For the Orthodox, Saturday — with the sole exception of Holy Saturday — is never a strict fast day. When a Saturday falls during one of the fasting seasons (Great Lent, Nativity Fast, Apostles&#x27; Fast, Dormition Fast) the fasting rules are always lessened to an extent. The Great Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross and the Beheading of St. John the Baptist are normally observed as strict fast days, but if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday, the fast is lessened.

==Name and associations==

Today, Saturday has two names in modern Standard German. The first word, , is always used in Austria, Liechtenstein, and the German-speaking part of Switzerland, and generally used in southern and western Germany. It derives from Old High German , the first part (&quot;sambaz&quot;) of which derives from Greek , and this Greek word derives from Hebrew , . However, the current German word for Sabbath is . The second name for Saturday in German is , which derives from Old High German , and is closely related to the Old English word . It means literally &quot;Sun eve&quot;, i.e., &quot;The day before Sunday&quot;. is generally used in northern and eastern Germany, and was also the official name for Saturday in East Germany. Even if these two names are used regionally differently, they are usually understood at least passively in the other part.

In West Frisian there are also two words for Saturday. In Wood Frisian it is , and in Clay Frisian it is , derived from , a combination of Old Frisian , meaning &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;joen&quot;, meaning eve.

In the Westphalian dialects of Low Saxon, in East Frisian Low Saxon and in the Saterland Frisian language, Saturday is called , also akin to Dutch , which has the same linguistic roots as the English word &quot;Saturday&quot;. It was formerly thought that the English name referred to a deity named &quot;Sætere&quot; who was venerated by the pre-Christian peoples of north-western Germany, some of whom were the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons. Sætere was identified as either a god associated with the harvest of possible Slav origin, or another name for Loki a complex deity associated with both good and evil; this latter suggestion may be due to Jacob Grimm. Regardless,modern dictionaries derive the name from &quot;Saturn&quot;.

In most languages of India, Saturday is , meaning day, based on Shani, the Hindu god manifested in the planet Saturn. Some Hindus fast on Saturdays to reverse the ill effects of Shani as well as pray to and worship the deity Hanuman. In the Thai solar calendar of Thailand, the day is named from the Pali word for Saturn, and the color associated with Saturday is purple. In Pakistan, Saturday is , meaning the week. In Eastern Indian languages like Bengali Saturday is called , meaning Saturn&#x27;s Day and is the first day of the Bengali Week in the Bengali calendar.
In Islamic countries, Fridays are considered as the last or penultimate day of the week and are holidays along with Thursdays or Saturdays; Saturday is called , (cognate to Sabbath) and it is the first day of the week in many Arab countries but the Last Day in other Islamic countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Central Asian countries.

In Japanese, the word Saturday is , , meaning &#x27;soil day&#x27; and is associated with , : Saturn (the planet), literally meaning &quot;soil star&quot;. Similarly, in Korean the word Saturday is , , also meaning earth day. The element Earth was associated with the planet Saturn in Chinese astrology and philosophy.

The modern Māori name for Saturday, , literally means &quot;washing-day&quot; – a vestige of early colonized life when Māori converts would set aside time on the Saturday to wash their whites for Church on Sunday. A common alternative Māori name for Saturday is the transliteration .

Quakers traditionally referred to Saturday as &quot;Seventh Day&quot;, eschewing the &quot;pagan&quot; origin of the name.

In Scandinavian countries, Saturday is called , , or , the name being derived from the old word &quot;laugr/laug&quot; (hence Icelandic name ), meaning bath, thus &quot;Lördag&quot; equates to bath-day. This is due to the Viking practice of bathing on Saturdays. The roots &quot;lör&quot;, &quot;laugar&quot; and so forth are cognate to the English word &quot;lye&quot;, in the sense of detergent. The Finnish and Estonian names for the day, and , respectively, are also derived from this term.

==Position in the week==

The international standard ISO 8601 sets Saturday as the sixth day of the week. The three Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) regard Saturday as the seventh day of the week. As a result, many refused the ISO 8601 standards and continue to use Saturday as their seventh day.

==Saturday Sabbath==

For Jews, Messianics, Seventh Day Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists, the seventh day of the week, known as Shabbat (or Sabbath for Seventh-day Adventists), stretches from sundown Friday to nightfall Saturday and is the day of rest. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches distinguish between Saturday (Sabbath) and the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday). Other Protestant groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, hold that the Lord&#x27;s Day is the Sabbath, according to the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8), and not Sunday.

<text>Friday is the day of the week between Thursday and Saturday. In countries that adopt the traditional &quot;Sunday-first&quot; convention, it is the sixth day of the week. In countries adopting the ISO 8601-defined &quot;Monday-first&quot; convention, it is the fifth day of the week. 


In most Western countries, Friday is the fifth and final day of the working week. In some other countries, Friday is the first day of the weekend, with Saturday the second. In Iran, Friday is the last day of the weekend, with Saturday as the first day of the working week. Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Kuwait also followed this convention until they changed to a Friday–Saturday weekend on September 1, 2006, in Bahrain and the UAE, and a year later in Kuwait. In Israel, by Jewish tradition, Friday is the sixth day of the week, and the last working day.

==Etymology==

In the seven-day week introduced in the Roman Empire in the first century CE, the days were named after the classical planets of Hellenistic astrology (the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn). The English name &quot;Friday&quot; comes from the Old English &#x27;, meaning the &quot;day of Frig&quot;, a result of an old convention associating the Nordic goddess Frigg with the Roman goddess Venus after whom the planet was named; the same holds for &#x27; in Old High German, &#x27; in Modern German, and &#x27; in Dutch.

==&quot;Friday&quot; in other languages==
The expected cognate name in Old Norse would be &#x27;. The name of Friday in Old Norse is &#x27; instead, indicating a loan of the week-day names from Low German; however, the modern Faroese name is &#x27;. The modern Scandinavian form is &quot;&quot; in Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish, meaning Freyja&#x27;s day. The distinction between Freyja and Frigg in some Germanic mythologies is contested.

The word for Friday in most Romance languages is derived from Latin &#x27; or &quot;day of Venus&quot; (a translation of Greek &#x27;, ), such as &#x27; in French, in Galician, &#x27; in Catalan, &#x27; in Corsican, &#x27; in Italian, &#x27; in Romanian, and &#x27; in Spanish and influencing the Filipino &#x27; or &#x27;, and the Chamorro &#x27;. This is also reflected in the p-Celtic Welsh language as &#x27;.

An exception is Portuguese, also a Romance language, which uses the word &#x27;, meaning &quot;sixth day of liturgical celebration&quot;, derived from the Latin &#x27; used in religious texts where consecrating days to pagan gods was not allowed. Another exception among the Romance languages is also Sardinian, in which the word &#x27; is derived from Latin &#x27;. This name had been given by the Jewish community exiled to the island in order to designate the food specifically prepared for Shabbat eve.

In Arabic, Friday is &#x27;, from a root meaning &quot;congregation/gathering.&quot; In languages of Islamic countries outside the Arab world, the word for Friday is commonly a derivation of this: (Malay &quot;Jumaat&quot; or &quot;Jumat&quot; , Turkish &#x27;, Persian/Urdu , &quot;) and Swahili (Ijumaa).

In modern Greek, four of the words for the week-days are derived from ordinals. However, the Greek word for Friday is &quot; () and is derived from a word meaning &quot;to prepare&quot; (). Like Saturday (, ) and Sunday (, ), Friday is named for its liturgical significance as the day of preparation before Sabbath, which was inherited by Greek Christian Orthodox culture from Jewish practices.

Friday was formerly a Christian fast day; this is the origin of the Irish &#x27;, Scottish Gaelic &#x27;, Manx &#x27; and Icelandic &#x27;, all meaning &quot;fast day&quot;.

In both biblical and modern Hebrew, Friday is &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;the sixth day&quot;.

In most Indian languages, Friday is &quot;Shukravāra&quot;, named for , the planet Venus. In Bengali or &quot;&quot; is the 6th day in the Bengali week of Bengali Calendar and is the beginning of the weekend in Bangladesh. In Tamil, the word for Friday is &quot;velli&quot;, also a name for Venus; and in Malayalam it is &quot;velliyalca&quot;. 

In Japanese, is formed from the words meaning Venus (lit. gold + planet) and meaning day (of the week).

In the Korean language, it is in Korean Hangul writing (Romanization: &quot;&quot;), and is the pronounced form of the written word in Chinese characters, as in Japanese.

In Chinese, Friday is 星期五 &quot;xīngqíwǔ&quot; meaning &quot;fifth day of the week&quot;.

In the Nahuatl language, Friday is &quot;&quot; () meaning &quot;day of Quetzalcoatl&quot;.

Most Slavic languages call Friday the &quot;fifth (day)&quot;: Belarusian – &#x27;, Bulgarian – &#x27;, Czech &#x27;, Polish &#x27;, Russian – &#x27;, Serbo-Croatian – &#x27;, Slovak &#x27;, Slovene &#x27;, and Ukrainian – &#x27;. The Hungarian word &#x27; is a loan from the Slavic Pannonian dialect. The n in &quot;&quot; suggests an early adoption from Slavic, when many Slavic dialects still had nasal vowels. In modern Slavic languages only Polish retained nasal vowels.

==In culture==
Friday is considered unlucky in some cultures. This is particularly so in maritime circles; perhaps the most enduring sailing superstition is that it is unlucky to begin a voyage on a Friday. In the 19th century, Admiral William Henry Smyth described Friday in his nautical lexicon &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Word-Book&quot; as:

(&quot;&quot; means &quot;unlucky day&quot;.) This superstition is the root of the well-known urban legend of .

In modern times since the Middle Ages, Friday the 13th and Friday the 17th are considered to be especially unlucky, due to the conjunction of Friday with the unlucky numbers thirteen and seventeen. Such a Friday may be called a &quot;Black Friday&quot;.

However, this superstition is not universal, notably in Hispanic, Greek and Scottish Gaelic culture:
 In Hispanic and Greek cultures, Tuesday is the unlucky day, specifically the 13th.

Popularly, Fridays are seen as days of good luck and happiness, since it is the last day of a work week as well as many school weeks that end every Friday.

==In astrology==

In astrology, Friday is connected with the planet Venus and is symbolized by that planet&#x27;s symbol ♀. Friday is also associated with the astrological signs Libra and Taurus. 
Modern nursery rhymes claim that &#x27;Friday&#x27;s child is loving and giving&#x27;, yet in 1775, children born on a Friday were described as having a &#x27;strong constitution, but very involved in the romances; and if female, She is in great danger of turning into questionable moral behaviors&#x27;


==In religions==
===Christianity===

In Christianity, Good Friday is the Friday before Easter. It commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus. Adherents of many Christian denominations including the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Methodist, and Anglican traditions observe the Friday fast, which traditionally includes abstinence from meat, lacticinia, and alcohol on Fridays of the year.

Traditionally, Roman Catholics were obliged to refrain from eating the meat of warm-blooded animals on Fridays, although fish was allowed. The Filet-O-Fish was invented in 1962 by Lou Groen, a McDonald&#x27;s franchise owner in Cincinnati, Ohio, in response to falling hamburger sales on Fridays resulting from the Roman Catholic practice of abstaining from meat on Fridays.

In the present day, episcopal conferences are now authorized to allow some other form of penance to replace abstinence from meat. The 1983 Code of Canon Law states:
:Canon 1250. The days and times of penance for the universal Church are each Friday of the whole year and the season of Lent.
:Canon 1251. Abstinence from meat, or from some other food as determined by the Episcopal Conference, is to be observed on all Fridays, unless a solemnity should fall on a Friday. Abstinence and fasting are to be observed on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.
:Canon 1253. The Episcopal Conference can determine more particular ways in which fasting and abstinence are to be observed. In place of abstinence or fasting it can substitute, in whole or in part, other forms of penance, especially works of charity and exercises of piety.

The Book of Common Prayer prescribes weekly Friday fasting and abstinence from meat for all Anglicans.

In Methodism, the Directions Given to Band Societies (25 December 1744) mandate for all Methodists fasting and abstinence from meat on all Fridays of the year.

The Eastern Orthodox Church continues to observe Fridays (as well as Wednesdays) as fast days throughout the year (with the exception of several fast-free periods during the year). Fasting on Fridays entails abstinence from meat or meat products (i.e., quadrupeds), poultry, and dairy products (as well as fish). Unless a feast day occurs on a Friday, the Orthodox also abstain from using oil in their cooking and from alcoholic beverages (there is some debate over whether abstention from oil involves all cooking oil or only olive oil). On particularly important feast days, fish may also be permitted. For the Orthodox, Fridays throughout the year commemorate the Crucifixion of Christ and the (Mother of God), especially as she stood by the foot of the cross. There are hymns in the which reflect this liturgically. These include &#x27; (hymns to the Mother of God) which are chanted on Wednesdays and Fridays called &#x27; (&quot;Cross-&quot;). The dismissal at the end of services on Fridays begins with the words: &quot;May Christ our true God, through the power of the precious and life-giving cross...&quot;

Quakers traditionally referred to Friday as &quot;Sixth Day&quot;, eschewing the pagan origins of the name. In Slavic countries, it is called &quot;Fifth Day&quot; (, , &quot;&quot;).

===Hinduism===
The day is named after Shukra son of Bhrigu and Kavyamata (Usana). In Hinduism, special observances are practiced for forms of the Devi, such as Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kali, Parvati, Annapurna, Gayatri, or Santoshi Mata on Friday. Fridays are important for married ladies and they worship the goddesses on that day.

===Islam===

In Islam, Friday (from sun-down Thursday to sun-down Friday) is the day of communion, of praying together, the holy day of Muslims. Friday observance includes attendance at a Masjid (mosque) for congregation prayer or Salat Al Jumu&#x27;ah. It is considered a day of peace and mercy (see Jumu&#x27;ah).

According to some Islamic traditions, the day is stated to be the original holy day ordained by God, but that now Jews and Christians recognize the days after. In some Islamic countries, the week begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday, just like the Jewish week and the week in some Christian countries. The week begins on Saturday and ends on Friday in most other Islamic countries, such as Somalia, and Iran. Friday is also the day of rest in the Baháʼí Faith. In some Malaysian states, Friday is the first week-end day, with Saturday the second, to allow Muslims to perform their religious obligations on Friday. Sunday is the first working day of the week for governmental organizations.

Muslims are recommended not to fast on a Friday by itself (&quot;makruh&quot;, recommended against, but not &quot;haram&quot;, religiously forbidden), unless it is accompanied with fasting the day before (Thursday) or day after (Saturday), or it corresponds with days usually considered good for fasting (i.e. Day of Arafah or Ashura), or it falls within one&#x27;s usual religious fasting habits (i.e. fasting every other day), then it is completely permissible.
Muslims believe Friday as &quot;Syed-ul-Ayyam&quot; meaning King of days. A narration in Sahih Muslim describes the importance of Friday as follows.

&quot;Abu Huraira reported the Messenger of Allah as saying: 

The Qur&#x27;an also has a surah (chapter) called Al-Jumu&#x27;ah (The Friday).

===Judaism===
Jewish Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday and lasts until nightfall on Saturday. There is a Jewish custom to fast on the Friday of the week of Chukat.

==Named days==

The phrase now is used worldwide without regard to religion to express joy in anticipation of the weekend.

<text>Thursday is the day of the week between Wednesday and Friday. According to the ISO 8601 international standard, it is the fourth day of the week. In countries which adopt the &quot;Sunday-first&quot; convention, it is the fifth day of the week.

==Name==
===Thunor&#x27;s day===
The name is derived from Old English &quot;þunresdæg&quot; and Middle English &quot;Thuresday&quot;. It was named after the Old English god &quot;Thunor&quot;. &quot;Thunor&quot; and &quot;Thor&quot; are derived from the name of the Germanic god of thunder, *&quot;Thunraz&quot;, equivalent to Jupiter in the &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;.

In most Romance languages, the day is named after the Roman god Jupiter, who was the god of sky and thunder. In Latin, the day was known as &quot;Iovis Dies&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Day&quot;. In Latin, the genitive or possessive case of Jupiter was &quot;Iovis&quot;/&quot;Jovis&quot; and thus in most Romance languages it became the word for Thursday: Italian &quot;giovedì&quot;, Spanish &quot;jueves&quot;, French &quot;jeudi&quot;, Sardinian jòvia, Catalan &quot;dijous&quot;, Galician &quot;xoves&quot; and Romanian &quot;joi&quot;. This is also reflected in the p-Celtic Welsh &quot;dydd Iau&quot;.

The astrological and astronomical sign of the planet Jupiter (♃ ) is sometimes used to represent Thursday.

Most Germanic languages name the day after the Germanic thunder god: &quot;Torsdag&quot; in Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, &quot;Hósdagur&quot;/&quot;Tórsdagur&quot; in Faroese, &quot;Donnerstag&quot; in German or &quot;Donderdag&quot; in Dutch. Finnish and Northern Sami, both non-Germanic (Uralic) languages, uses the borrowing &quot;Torstai&quot; and &quot;Duorastat&quot;. In the extinct Polabian Slavic language, it was &quot;perundan&quot;, Perun being the Slavic equivalent of Thor.

===Vishnu&#x27;s/Buddha&#x27;s/Dattatrey&#x27;s Day===
In most of the languages of India, the word for Thursday is &quot;Guruvāra&quot; – &quot;vāra&quot; meaning day and &quot;Guru&quot; being the style for Bṛhaspati, guru to the gods and regent of the planet Jupiter. This day marks the worship of Vishnu and his avatars such as Rama, Satyanarayana, Parashurama, Narasimha, and Buddha as well as the deity Dattatreya in Hinduism. In Sanskrit language, the day is called Bṛhaspativāsaram (day of Bṛhaspati). In Nepali language, the day is called &quot;Bihivāra&quot; with &quot;Bihi&quot; derived from the corruption of the shorter form &#x27;Brhi&#x27; of the word Bṛhaspati. In Thai, the word is &quot;Wan Pharuehatsabodi&quot;, also in Old Javanese as &quot;Respati&quot; or in Balinese as &quot;Wraspati&quot; – referring to the Hindu deity Bṛhaspati, also associated with Jupiter.
En was an old Illyrian deity and in his honor in the Albanian language Thursday is called &quot;Enjte&quot;. 
In the Nahuatl language, Thursday is () meaning &quot;day of Tezcatlipoca&quot;.

In Japanese, the day is (木 represents Jupiter, 木星), following East Asian tradition.

===Fourth day===

In Slavic languages and in Chinese, this day&#x27;s name is &quot;fourth&quot; (Slovak &quot;štvrtok&quot;, Czech &quot;čtvrtek&quot;, Slovene &quot;četrtek&quot;, Polish &quot;czwartek&quot;, Russian четверг &quot;chetverg&quot;, Bulgarian четвъртък, Serbo-Croatian четвртак / &quot;četvrtak&quot;, Macedonian четврток, Ukrainian четвер &quot;chetver&quot;). Hungarian uses a Slavic loanword &quot;csütörtök&quot;. In Chinese, it is &quot;xīngqīsì&quot; (&quot;fourth solar day&quot;). In Estonian it&#x27;s &quot;neljapäev&quot;, meaning &quot;fourth day&quot; or &quot;fourth day in a week&quot;. The Baltic languages also use the term &quot;fourth day&quot; (Latvian &quot;ceturtdiena&quot;, Lithuanian &quot;ketvirtadienis&quot;).

===Fifth day===

Greek uses a number for this day: Πέμπτη &quot;Pémpti&quot; &quot;fifth,&quot; as does &quot;fifth day,&quot; Hebrew: (&quot;Yom Khamishi&quot; – day fifth) often written (&quot;Yom Hey&quot; – 5th letter Hey day), and Arabic: (&quot;Yaum al-Khamīs&quot; – fifth day). Rooted from Arabic, the Indonesian word for Thursday is &quot;Kamis&quot;, similarly &quot;Khamis&quot; in Malaysian and &quot;Kemis&quot; in Javanese.

In Catholic liturgy, Thursday is referred to in Latin as &quot;feria quinta&quot;. Portuguese, unlike other Romance languages, uses the word &quot;quinta-feira,&quot; meaning &quot;fifth day of liturgical celebration&quot;, that comes from the Latin &quot;feria quinta&quot; used in religious texts where it was not allowed to consecrate days to pagan gods.

Icelandic also uses the term &quot;fifth day&quot; (&quot;Fimmtudagur&quot;).

In the Persian language, Thursday is referred to as &quot;panj-shanbeh&quot;, meaning 5th day of the week.

Vietnamese refers to Thursday as (literally means &quot;day five&quot;).

Quakers traditionally referred to Thursday as &quot;Fifth Day&quot; eschewing the pagan origin of the English name &quot;Thursday&quot;.

==Cultural and religious practices==

===Christian holidays===
In the Christian tradition, Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday is the Thursday before Easter — the day on which the Last Supper occurred. Also known as &quot;Sheer Thursday&quot; in the United Kingdom, it is traditionally a day of cleaning and giving out Maundy money there. Holy Thursday is part of Holy Week.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Thursdays are dedicated to the Apostles and Saint Nicholas. The Octoechos contains hymns on these themes, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Thursdays throughout the year. At the end of Divine Services on Thursday, the dismissal begins with the words: &quot;May Christ our True God, through the intercessions of his most-pure Mother, of the holy, glorious and all-laudable Apostles, of our Father among the saints Nicholas, Archbishop of Myra in Lycia, the Wonder-worker…&quot;

Ascension Thursday is 40 days after Easter, when Christ ascended into Heaven.

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, Thursday is associated with the Navagraha Brihaspati, whom devotees of this graha will fast pray and fast on Thursdays. The day is dedicated to the deity Vishnu or his avatars, such as Rama, Parshurama, Narasimha, Satyanarayan, and Buddha. However, Wednesday is dedicated to his avatars of Krishna and Vithoba. Devotees usually fast on this day in honor of Vishnu and his avatars, especially Vaishnava Hindus.

===Islam===
In Islam, Thursdays are one of the days in a week in which Muslims are encouraged to do voluntary fasting, the other being Mondays.

===Judaism===

In Judaism, Thursdays are considered auspicious days for fasting. The Didache warned early Christians not to fast on Thursdays to avoid Judaizing, and suggested Fridays instead.

In Judaism the Torah is read in public on Thursday mornings, and special penitential prayers are said on Thursday, unless there is a special occasion for happiness which cancels them.

===Druze faith===

Formal Druze worship is confined to weekly meeting on Thursday evenings, during which all members of community gather together to discuss local issues before those not initiated into the secrets of the faith (the juhhāl, or the ignorant) are dismissed, and those who are &quot;uqqāl&quot; or &quot;enlightened&quot; (those few initiated in the Druze holy books) remain to read and study their holy scriptures.

===Practices in countries===

In Finland and Sweden, pea soup is traditionally served on Thursdays.

In Indonesia, and Malaysia, in a week, batik clothing is usually worn on Thursday, especially at education and civil servant institutions.

For Thai Buddhist, Thursday is considered the &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Day&quot;, and it is believed that one should begin one&#x27;s education on this auspicious day. Thai students still pay homages to their teachers in specific ceremony always held on a selected Thursday. And graduation day in Thai universities, which can vary depending on each university, almost always will be held on a Thursday.

In the Thai solar calendar, the colour associated with Thursday is orange.

In the United States, Thanksgiving Day is an annual festival celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November.

===Conventional weekly events===
In Australia, most cinema movies premieres are held on Thursdays. Also, most Australians are paid on a Thursday, either weekly or fortnightly. Shopping malls see this as an opportunity to open longer than usual, generally until 9 pm, as most pay cheques are cleared by Thursday morning.

In Norway, Thursday has also traditionally been the day when most shops and malls are open later than on the other weekdays, although the majority of shopping malls now are open until 8 pm or 9 pm every weekday.

In the USSR of the 1970s and 1980s Thursday was the &quot;Fish Day&quot; (, &quot;Rybny den&quot;), when the nation&#x27;s foodservice establishments were supposed to serve fish (rather than meat) dishes.

For college and university students, Thursday is sometimes referred to as the new Friday. There are often fewer or sometimes no classes on Fridays and more opportunities to hold parties on Thursday night and sleep in on Friday. As a consequence, some call Thursday &quot;thirstday&quot; or &quot;thirsty Thursday&quot;.

===Elections in the United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, all general elections since 1935 have been held on a Thursday, and this has become a tradition, although not a requirement of the law — which merely states that an election may be held on any day &quot;except Saturdays, Sundays, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Good Friday, bank holidays in any part of the United Kingdom and any day appointed for public thanksgiving and mourning&quot;.

Additionally, local elections are usually held on the first Thursday in May.

The Electoral Administration Act 2006 removed Maundy Thursday as an excluded day on the electoral timetable, therefore an election can now be held on Maundy Thursday; prior to this elections were sometimes scheduled on the Tuesday before as an alternative.

==Astrology==
Thursday is aligned by the planet Jupiter and the astrological signs of Pisces and Sagittarius.

<text>Wednesday is the day of the week between Tuesday and Thursday. According to international standard ISO 8601, it is the third day of the week.

In English, the name is derived from Old English and Middle English , &#x27;day of Woden&#x27;, reflecting the religion practised by the Anglo-Saxons, the English equivalent to the Norse god Odin. In many Romance languages, such as the French , Spanish or Italian , the day&#x27;s name is a calque of Latin &#x27;day of Mercury&#x27;.

Wednesday is in the middle of the common Western five-day workweek that starts on Monday and finishes on Friday.

==Etymology==
:&quot;See Names of the days of the week for more on naming conventions.&quot;
The name Wednesday continues Middle English . Old English still had , which would be continued as &quot;*Wodnesday&quot; (but Old Frisian has an attested ). By the early 13th century, the &quot;i&quot;-mutated form was introduced unetymologically.

The name is a calque of the Latin &#x27;day of Mercury&#x27;, reflecting the fact that the Germanic god Woden (Wodanaz or Odin) during the Roman era was interpreted as &quot;Germanic Mercury&quot;.

The Latin name dates to the late 2nd or early 3rd century. It is a calque of Greek (), a term first attested, together with the system of naming the seven weekdays after the seven classical planets, in the &quot;Anthologiarum&quot; by Vettius Valens (c. AD 170).

The Latin name is reflected directly in the weekday name in most modern Romance languages: (Sardinian), (French), (Italian), (Spanish), (Romanian), (Catalan), or (Corsican), (Venetian). In Welsh it is , meaning &#x27;Mercury&#x27;s Day&#x27;.

The Dutch name for the day, , has the same etymology as English &quot;Wednesday&quot;; it comes from Middle Dutch , (&#x27;Wodan&#x27;s day&#x27;).

The German name for the day, (literally: &#x27;mid-week&#x27;), replaced the former name (&#x27;Wodan&#x27;s day&#x27;) in the 10th century. (Similarly, the Yiddish word for Wednesday is (), meaning and sounding a lot like the German word it came from.)

Most Slavic languages follow this pattern and use derivations of &#x27;the middle&#x27; (Belarusian , Bulgarian , Croatian , Czech , Macedonian , Polish , Russian , Serbian or , Slovak , Slovene , Ukrainian ). 
The Finnish name is (&#x27;middle of the week&#x27;), as is the Icelandic name: , and the Faroese name: (&#x27;mid-week day&#x27;). Some dialects of Faroese have , though, which shares etymology with Wednesday. Danish, Norwegian, Swedish , ( meaning &#x27;Odin&#x27;s day&#x27;).

In Japanese, the word for Wednesday is meaning &#x27;water day&#x27; and is associated with (): Mercury (the planet), literally meaning &#x27;water star&#x27;. Similarly, in Korean the word for Wednesday is , also meaning &#x27;water day&#x27;.

In most of the languages of India, the word for Wednesday is — meaning &#x27;day&#x27; and &quot;Budha&quot; being the planet Mercury.

In Armenian ( ), Georgian ( ), Turkish (), and Tajik () languages the word literally means &#x27;four (days) from Saturday&#x27; originating from Persian ( ).

Portuguese uses the word , meaning &#x27;fourth day&#x27;, while in Greek the word is () meaning simply &#x27;fourth&#x27;. Similarly, Arabic means &#x27;fourth&#x27;, Hebrew means &#x27;fourth&#x27;, and Persian means &#x27;fourth day&#x27;. Yet the name for the day in Estonian , Lithuanian , and Latvian means &#x27;third day&#x27; while in Mandarin Chinese (), means &#x27;day three&#x27;, as Sunday is unnumbered.

==Religious observances==

The Creation narrative in the Hebrew Bible places the creation of the Sun and Moon on &quot;the fourth day&quot; of the divine workweek.

Quakers traditionally referred to Wednesday as &quot;Fourth Day&quot; to avoid the pagan associations with the name &quot;Wednesday&quot;, or in keeping with the practice of treating each day as equally divine.

The Eastern Orthodox Church observes Wednesday (as well as Friday) as a fast day throughout the year (with the exception of several fast-free periods during the year). Fasting on Wednesday and Fridays entails abstinence from meat or animal products (i.e., four-footed animals), poultry and dairy products. Unless a feast day occurs on a Wednesday, the Orthodox also abstain from fish, from using oil in their cooking and from alcoholic beverages (there is some debate over whether abstention from oil involves all cooking oil or only olive oil). For the Orthodox, Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year commemorate the betrayal of Jesus (Wednesday) and the Crucifixion of Christ (Friday). There are hymns in the Octoekhos which reflect this liturgically. These include special &quot;Theotokia&quot; (hymns to the Mother of God) called (&#x27;Cross-Theotokia&#x27;). The dismissal at the end of services on Wednesday begins with these words: &quot;May Christ our true God, through the power of the precious and life-giving cross...&quot;

In Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the name for Wednesday also refers to fasting, as it is in Irish Gaelic and in Scottish Gaelic, which comes from &#x27;, meaning &#x27;first&#x27;, and &#x27;, meaning &#x27;fasting&#x27;, which combined means &#x27;first day of fasting&#x27;.

In American culture many Catholic and Protestant churches schedule study or prayer meetings on Wednesday nights. The sports calendar in many American public schools reflects this, reserving Mondays and Thursdays for girls&#x27; games and Tuesdays and Fridays for boys&#x27; games while generally avoiding events on Wednesday evening.

In the Catholic devotion of the Holy Rosary, the glorious mysteries are meditated on Wednesday and also Sunday throughout the year.

Wednesday is the day of the week devoted by the Catholic tradition to Saint Joseph.

In Hinduism, Budha is the god of Mercury (planet), Wednesday, and of merchants and merchandise. Krishna, Vithoba, and Ganesha are also worshipped on Wednesday.

==Cultural usage==
According to the Thai solar calendar, the color associated with Wednesday is green.

In the folk rhyme Monday&#x27;s Child, &quot;Wednesday&#x27;s child is full of woe&quot;. In the rhyme Solomon Grundy, Grundy was &quot;married on Wednesday&quot;. In &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot;, the disagreeable nature of the weather is attributed to it being &quot;Winds-Day&quot; (a play on &quot;Wednesday&quot;). In Richard Brautigan&#x27;s &quot;In Watermelon Sugar&quot; Wednesday is the day when the sun shines grey. Wednesday Friday Addams is a member of the fictional family The Addams Family. Her name is derived from the idea that Wednesday&#x27;s child is full of woe. Additionally, Wednesday sometimes appears as a character&#x27;s name in literary works. These include &quot;Thursday&#x27;s fictions&quot; by Richard James Allen, Wednesday Next from the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde and Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;American Gods&quot;. In the 1945 John Steinbeck novel &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot;, the titular day is preceded by &quot;Lousy Wednesday&quot;.

Wednesday is sometimes informally referred to as &quot;&quot; in North America, a reference to the fact that Wednesday is the middle day—or &quot;hump&quot;—of a typical work week. &quot;Lillördag&quot;, or &quot;little Saturday&quot;, is a Nordic tradition of turning Wednesday evening into a small weekend-like celebration. Humpday is also a name of a 2009 film.

In Poland, Wednesday night is often referred by young people as &quot;time of vodka&quot;, after song by Bartosz Walaszek &quot;Środowa noc to wódy czas&quot;

==Astrology==
The astrological sign of the planet Mercury, ☿, represents Wednesday— to the Romans, it had similar names in Latin-derived languages, such as the Italian ( means &#x27;day&#x27;), the French , and the Spanish . In English, this became &quot;Woden&#x27;s Day&quot;, since the Roman god Mercury was identified by Woden in Northern Europe and it is especially aligned by the astrological signs of Gemini and Virgo.

<doc id="54635" wikidata="Q127" url="?curid=54635" title="Tuesday">
<text>Tuesday is the day of the week between Monday and Wednesday. According to international standard ISO 8601, Monday is the first day of the week; thus, Tuesday is the second day of the week. According to many traditional calendars, however, Sunday is the first day of the week, so Tuesday is the third day of the week. In some Muslim countries, Saturday is the first day of the week and thus Tuesday is the fourth day of the week. 

The English name is derived from Middle English , from Old English meaning &quot;Tīw&#x27;s Day&quot;, the day of Tiw or Týr, the god of single combat, law, and justice in Norse mythology. Tiw was equated with Mars in the , and the name of the day is a translation of Latin .

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Tuesday&quot; derives from the Old English and literally means &quot;Tiw&#x27;s Day&quot;. Tiw is the Old English form of the Proto-Germanic god &quot;*Tîwaz&quot;, or Týr in Old Norse. &quot;*Tîwaz&quot; derives from the Proto-Indo-European base &quot;*dei-&quot;, &quot;*deyā-&quot;, &quot;*dīdyā-&quot;, meaning &#x27;to shine&#x27;, whence comes also such words as &quot;deity&quot;.

The German &quot;Dienstag&quot; and Dutch &quot;dinsdag&quot; are derived from the Germanic custom of the &quot;thing&quot;, as Tiw / Týr also had a strong connection to the thing.

The Latin name (&quot;day of Mars&quot;) is equivalent to the Greek (, &quot;day of Ares&quot;). In most languages with Latin origins (Italian, French, Spanish, Catalan, Romanian, Galician, Sardinian, Corsican, but not Portuguese), the day is named after Mars, the Roman parallel of the Ancient Greek Ares ().

In some Slavic languages the word Tuesday originated from Old Church Slavonic word meaning &quot;the second&quot;. Bulgarian and Russian () ( ) is derived from the Bulgarian and Russian adjective for &#x27;second&#x27; – () or ().

In Japanese, the second day of the week is (), from (), the planet Mars. Similarly, in Korean the word Tuesday is (), means literally fire day, and Mars the planet is referred to as the fire star with the same words, but this is unrelated to the Roman god Mars, which is referred to phonetically as Mars.

In the Indo-Aryan languages Pali and Sanskrit the name of the day is taken from (&#x27;one who is red in colour&#x27;), a style (manner of address) for Mangala, the god of war, and for Mars, the red planet.

In the Nahuatl language, Tuesday is () meaning &quot;day of Huitzilopochtli&quot;.

In Arabic, Tuesday is (), and in Hebrew it is (), meaning &quot;third day&quot;. When added after the word / ( or ) it means &quot;the third day&quot;.

==Religious observances==
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Tuesdays are dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. The Octoechos contains hymns on this theme, arranged in an eight-week cycle, that are chanted on Tuesdays throughout the year. At the end of Divine Services on Tuesday, the dismissal begins with the words: &quot;May Christ our True God, through the intercessions of his most-pure Mother, of the honorable and glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist John…&quot;

In Hinduism, Tuesday is a popular day for worshipping and praying to Hanuman and Kartikeya, some also worship Kali, Durga, Parvati, and Ganesha. Many Hindus fast during Tuesday. Many Hindu married women also observe the Mangala Gauri Vrat of fasting every Tuesday in the Hindu month of Shravana, as the month is dedicated to Gauri and Shiva. Tuesday is also viewed as the day ruled by Mangala (Mars) in Hinduism.

==Cultural references==
In the Greek world, Tuesday (the day of the week of the Fall of Constantinople) is considered an unlucky day. The same is true in the Spanish-speaking world; it is believed that this is due to the association between Tuesday and Mars, the god of war and therefore related to death. For both Greeks and Spanish-speakers, the 13th of the month is considered unlucky if it falls on Tuesday, instead of Friday. In Judaism, on the other hand, Tuesday is considered a particularly lucky day, because in Bereshit (parashah), known in the Christian tradition as the first chapters of Genesis, the paragraph about this day contains the phrase &quot;it was good&quot; twice.

In the Thai solar calendar, the day is named for the Pali word for the planet Mars, which also means &quot;Ashes of the Dead&quot;; the color associated with Tuesday is pink.

In the folk rhyme &quot;Monday&#x27;s Child&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&#x27;s child is full of grace&quot;.

==Common occurrences==

===United States===
Tuesday is the usual day for elections in the United States. Federal elections take place on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November; this date was established by a law of 1845 for presidential elections (specifically for the selection of the Electoral College), and was extended to elections for the House of Representatives in 1875 and for the Senate in 1914. Tuesday was the earliest day of the week which was practical for polling in the early 19th century: citizens might have to travel for a whole day to cast their vote, and would not wish to leave on Sunday which was a day of worship for the great majority of them. However, a bill was introduced in 2012 to move elections to weekends, with a co-sponsor stating that &quot;by moving Election Day from a single day in the middle of the workweek to a full weekend, we are encouraging more working Americans to participate. Our democracy will be best served when our leaders are elected by as many Americans as possible.&quot;

Video games are commonly released on Tuesdays in the United States, this fact often attributed to the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; &quot;Sonic 2s day&quot; marketing campaign in 1992. DVDs and Blu-rays are released on Tuesday. Albums were typically released on Tuesdays as well, but this has changed to Fridays globally in 2015.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia meets on the first Tuesday of every month except January. The federal government hands down the federal budget on the second Tuesday in May, the practice since 1994 (except in 1996 and 2016). The Melbourne Cup is held each year on the first Tuesday in November.

==Astrology==
In astrology, Tuesday is aligned by the planet Mars and the astrological signs of Aries and Scorpio.

<text>Young Talent Time is an Australian television variety program produced by Lewis-Young Productions and screened on Network Ten. The original series ran from 1971 until 1988 and was hosted by singer-songwriter and record producer Johnny Young for its entire run. The show was briefly revived by Network Ten in 2012 and was hosted by singer and actor Rob Mills.

==History==
The series featured a core group of young performers, in the vein of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, and a weekly junior talent quest. The regular cast known as &quot;The Young Talent Team&quot; performed popular classic songs along with the top hit songs of the day. The original program launched the careers of a number of Australian performers including Sally Boyden, Jamie Redfern, Vikki Broughton, Debra Byrne (billed then as Debbie), Tina Arena and Dannii Minogue and spawned numerous hit singles, fifteen Young Talent Time albums, a film, as well as merchandise including swap cards, boardgames, toys, and mugs. The program won numerous Logie Awards.

==&quot;Young Talent Time&quot; (1971–1988)==
===Production details===
&quot;Young Talent Time&quot; was produced as a joint venture by &quot;Lewis-Young Productions&quot; (the production partnership between host Johnny Young and his friend and colleague Kevin Lewis, one of the directors of Festival Records) and was taped mainly at the studios of ATV-10 in Nunawading, Melbourne although occasional shows were taped at the TEN-10 studios in Sydney or on location.

Many of the episodes from the early- to mid-1970s no longer exist as the tapes were wiped for re-use, being the official Network Ten policy at the time. Some later episodes from the series were repeated by pay TV broadcaster Foxtel in the late 1990s.

On average, 44 episodes were produced per year for 18 years. The episodes were broadcast in black and white from April 1971 to April 1975, thereafter in colour. The final episode aired on 23 December 1988.

====&quot;Caravan Holiday&quot;====
In the Christmas break between the first and second seasons of &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;, Johnny Young and the Young Talent Team shot a 22-minute colour film. (At the time, &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; still screened in black and white on Australian television.) Sponsored by the Caravan Trade &amp; Industries Association &quot;Caravan Holiday&quot; was completed by early 1972 and released in cinemas across Australia as a supporting feature to Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s hugely popular US comedy picture &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; which starred Barbra Streisand and Ryan O&#x27;Neal.

The cast featured the then-current line-up of the Young Talent Team (Jamie Redfern, Rod Kirkham, Greg Mills, Philip Gould, Julie Ryles, Debbie Byrne, Vikki Broughton and Jane Scali) prior to Redfern&#x27;s departure to tour the US with Liberace. Despite not appearing in the film, new team member Trevor Hindmarch turned up to the premiere, as seen in the documentary &quot;Young Talent Time Tells All&quot;.

It featured actor/comedian Buster Fiddess (as Mr Crawley) and Addie Black, and guest appearances by Johnny Young (in multiple cameos as a service station attendant, farmer, caravan site manager and speedboat lake), Evie Hayes and John Farnham (then known as Johnny Farnham) as himself. Fiddess died just a few days after he finished filming his scenes. There was also a film clip made for the Young Talent Team&#x27;s version of The Cowsills&#x27; hit song &quot;The Rain, The Park and Other Things&quot;, shot in Melbourne&#x27;s Royal Botanic Gardens, but despite not appearing on the actual recording, being recorded prior to their recruitment, Mills and Ryles appeared in the clip.

It screened on television just once, on Christmas Eve 1972. It was then unseen for three decades until a restored version was featured as a bonus extra on the 2002 DVD &quot;Young Talent Time: The Collection&quot; (Universal Pictures - 2002).

In the opening credit sequence, Jane Scali&#x27;s surname is misspelt as Scarli.

====&quot;Alumni&quot;====
Over the original run of the show, from 1971 to 1988, there were a total of 40 cast members.

Members of the cast who found continued success after leaving the series and continue working as performers include Tina Arena, Vikki Broughton, Jane Scali, Jamie Redfern, Dannii Minogue, Karen Knowles, Sally Boyden, and Debra Byrne, Beven Addinsall and John Bowles.

The show had a policy that when team members reached 16 years of age, they had to leave the series and move on, but this rule would subsequently be stretched and broken.

===Concerts and live appearances===
Over the 18 years of the original show, Johnny Young and the various cast members made numerous live appearances all over Australia, performing full concerts or short publicity appearances at various venues.

In 1973, Young, the cast and Denis Walter supported Jamie Redfern in a series of live concerts. &quot;The Jamie Redfern Show&quot; sold out a number of shows at Melbourne&#x27;s Festival Hall.

In 1987, an unanticipated audience turnout of over 4,000 people caused trouble at a concert at the Westfield Shopping Centre, Parramatta. Some fans were crushed in the crowd and the concert was cancelled. Joey Dee had to be treated for a knee injury and Courtney Compagnino had to be treated for shock.

In 1988, over 12,000 people attended an outdoor concert held in Brisbane at the 1988 World Expo, which was broadcast on television the following week.

At the end of 1988, Young and the cast performed a series of concerts. The final concert was held at the Melbourne Tennis Centre on 23 December, the same night on which the last episode of &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; aired on Network Ten.

===Luna Park incident===
In the early 1970s the cast performed at Luna Park Sydney. Due to the large crowd in attendance, they were unable to leave. Park management offered to stop the scenic railway so that the cast could exit through the tunnel. According to Greg Mills, the train driver was not told, and the train did not stop. The cast narrowly avoided death by pressing themselves against the wall of the tunnel. If not for Brad Boyden, Sally Boyden&#x27;s father, neither of the team would have known that the roller coaster train was even approaching. Trevor Hindmarch came the closest to death or injury as his jacket was almost caught on the speeding vehicle as it passed. Fortunately Trevor lost only a button.

===Final years===
In 1988, an episode of Young Talent Time was shot in the United States. The two-hour special, &quot;Young Talent Time at Universal Studios&quot;, aired on 13 August 1988.

In its final years, Young Talent Time began to struggle for ratings, particularly following the decision of the Nine Network to move its popular early morning variety show &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; to the 6:30 pm slot in 1985, which put it in direct competition to Young Talent Time.

After four years of dwindling ratings, in October 1988 Network Ten finally decided to move &quot;YTT&quot; to Friday nights at 7.30 pm, but the change did not help. The show was cancelled three months later. The general manager of Channel 10 Melbourne, Renny Cunnack, announced on 25 January 1989 that &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; would &quot;not be resuming production in 1989&quot;. Cunnack himself was dismissed as General Manager three months later. The following day on Australia Day in 1989, the Young Talent Time cast performed a concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne.

Near the end of 1988, Johnny Young had invested a large amount of money in building his own TV studio complex in Richmond with the intention of producing the show himself and leasing it to Channel 10 but the termination of the show ended this plan and he was forced to sell his family home to finance his debts.

Network Ten continued airing compilation episodes in early 1989, initially as &quot;The Best of Young Talent Time&quot; at 7.30 on Friday nights, then as &quot;Young Talent Time Favorites&quot; at 11.00 on Saturday mornings. The last of these aired in Melbourne on Saturday 1 April 1989.

On September 26, 2021, Channel 10 aired a special anniversary edition of Young Talent Time. It marked the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

==&quot;The New Generation&quot; (1988)==
In 1988 Johnny Young launched an American version of the show re-titled &quot;The New Generation&quot;.

Produced in Australia, it starred the current senior members of the former Young Talent Time cast: Dannii Minogue, Vince Del Tito, Natalie Miller, Lorena Novoa, Beven Addinsall; and a new member, Keith Williams, from Los Angeles. The show also featured regular appearances from the younger members of the former cast, who were billed as &quot;The Young Generation&quot;: Jamie Churchill, Johnnie Nuich, Joey Dee, Courtney Compagnino, Juanita Coco and Rikki Arnot.

&quot;The New Generation&quot; was hosted by American Michael Young, the host of the Emmy Award winning &quot;Kids Are People Too&quot;. Thirteen 30-minute episodes were produced by Johnny Young&#x27;s Television House and Fries Entertainment and screened on CBN Cable Network/The CBN Family Channel (now Freeform) in the US.

==&quot;Young Talent Time&quot; (1990)==
In 1990 Johnny Young self-funded and produced a one-off direct-to-video special titled &quot;Young Talent Time Now - 1990&quot;. It featured the final six members of the cast (Jamie Churchill, Johnnie Nuich, Joey Dee, Courtney Compagnino, Juanita Coco, and Rikki Arnot) and former cast member Beven Addinsall.

==&quot;Young Talent Time&quot; (2012)==
Network Ten and Granada Australia - in conjunction with Johnny Young and Johnny Young Music - were the producers of a revival of &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;. Taped before a live studio audience at Fox Studios in Sydney, the 15-episode series debuted on Network Ten across Australia at 6.30 pm on Sunday 22 January 2012.

Hosted by former &quot;Australian Idol 2003&quot; contestant Rob Mills, the 2012 revival featured a regular Young Talent Team (of 10 members) performing a couple of group numbers each week, with one team member featuring in a solo spot each episode to showcase their individual talents. Starting from Episode 10, duets were sung instead of solos as each team member had performed a solo.

Each weekly episode featured three or four young contestants (or acts) under the age of 16. These solo performers, duos, groups, etc., included singers, dancers (ballet, hip hop, tap, jazz, etc.), musicians, sight acts, illusionists, comedians and so on. The winning contestant (or act) each week received $5,000 from NAB (National Australia Bank) and the Grand Final winner received $100,000.
Sherrynne Johnson a young Tasmanian semi finals Winner was unable to return for the Grand Final due to 
unforeseen family circumstances.

The show&#x27;s two judges/mentors were the original show&#x27;s longest-serving Young Talent Team member Tina Arena (who appeared from 1977 to 1983 – six years 6 Months), and Filipino-American choreographer Charles Klapow, one of the winners of the Emmy Award for &#x27;Outstanding Choreography&#x27; for &quot;High School Musical 2&quot;. Better known as &#x27;Chucky&#x27; Klapow, he also helped choreograph the films &quot;Cheetah Girls 2, High School Musical and High School Musical 3: Senior Year&quot; as well as appearing in all three &quot;High School Musical&quot; movies as a dancer. He has choreographed for Mick Jagger and dances alongside Michael Jackson in the film &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s This Is It&quot;. Klapow had previously been a judge on UK talent show &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believing&quot;. TV Personality Ian Dickson filled in as judge while Tina Arena was ill for one episode. From the beginning of the finals competition he served as a full-time judge.

While the judges decided the winning contestant (or act) of each weekly episode, viewers could vote online for any of the weekly runners-up to become a &#x27;wild-card&#x27; entrant, giving them a second chance of making it into the finals. On 20 March, it was announced that &quot;YTT&quot; would move to Fridays at 7:30 to 8:30, the current time slot of Glee. It is believed &quot;YTT&quot; was moved because of poor ratings on Sunday night resulting in the much more popular program &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; taking the 6:30 to 7:30 timeslot. The YTT team then commenced a tour having shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. The Grand Final episode was aired on 4 May. The talent quest was won by first heat entrants and wildcard winners Lil&#x27; Banditz Krew. The all-boys Hip Hop troupe toured with the YTT team and Rob Mills in June and July 2012, visiting various Sydney venues as well as Melbourne and Canberra.

&quot;YTT&quot; was not renewed for a 2013 season because of poor ratings. However, such team members as Aydan Calafiore and Adrien Nookadu went on to have music careers and Georgia-May Davis worked with Disney Channel Australia. Lyndall Wennekes later starred on &quot;The Voice&quot; in 2014, Adrien Nookadu on &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2014. Aydan Calafiore appeared on &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; in 2013 and auditioned for the 2017 and 2018 seasons of The Voice, being unable to turn a chair in 2017 but turning all four chairs in 2018. Aydan joined Joe Jonas&#x27; and ultimately placed 4th place on &quot;The Voice&quot;, which resulted in him releasing his own music as well as being on Eurovision - Australia Decides in 2019.

===DVDs===
A one-hour prime-time television documentary &quot;Young Talent Time Tells All&quot; aired on Network Ten on 29 October 2001. Produced and directed by former YTT cast member John Bowles, it was a tremendous ratings success celebrating the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Bowles interviewed over thirty of the original cast members for the programme. Archive footage, including clips thought to have been lost, were interspersed with the YTT kids speaking about their experiences on and off-air.

A small reunion of &quot;YTT&quot; cast and crew members (including Tina Arena, Dannii Minogue and Johnny Young) was held in Melbourne in October 2003 to launch the release of an extended version of the &quot;Young Talent Time Tells All&quot; documentary on DVD (through Universal Pictures). The original documentary TV Special was extended, and bonus features and rare footage, not seen in the television version, were added. It was titled &quot;Young Talent Time: The Collection&quot;.

Bonus features on the DVD include a restored version of the 1972 short film &quot;Caravan Holiday&quot; featuring Johnny Young and the Young Talent Team; full biographies of all 40 Team Members and Johnny Young; Nicole Kidman&#x27;s appearance as a guest on the show to promote her 1983 film &quot;BMX Bandits&quot;; assorted television commercials featuring members of the team; footage of some of the Team when they appeared as contestants on the show; and the full-length clip of sisters Dannii Minogue and Kylie Minogue performing the song &quot;Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves&quot;.

Rare footage includes a nine-year-old Jamie Redfern (pre-&quot;Young Talent Time&quot;) appearing with Happy Hammond on a Channel Seven test broadcast of colour television in 1968, seven years before Australian television actually began broadcasting in colour.

<doc id="54644" wikidata="Q156049" url="?curid=54644" title="Manowar">
<text>Manowar is an American heavy metal band from Auburn, New York. Formed in 1980, the group is known for lyrics based on fantasy (particularly sword and sorcery) and mythology (particularly Norse mythology and Greco-Roman mythology), as well as numerous songs celebrating the genre and its core audience. The band is also known for a loud and emphatic sound. In an interview for MTV in February 2007, bassist Joey DeMaio lamented that &quot;these days, there&#x27;s a real lack of big, epic metal that is drenched with crushing guitars and choirs and orchestras... so it&#x27;s nice to be one of the few bands that&#x27;s actually doing that&quot;. In 1984, the band was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance, a record which they have since broken on two occasions. They also hold the world record for the longest heavy metal concert after playing for five hours and 1 minute in Bulgaria (at Kavarna Rock Fest) in 2008. They also have been known for their slogan &quot;Death to false metal&quot;.

==Biography==
===Origins (1980–1981)===
Manowar&#x27;s history began in 1980 when Joey DeMaio, the future bassist of the band, met guitarist Ross the Boss while working as a bass tech and fireworks manager for Black Sabbath on the Heaven &amp; Hell Tour. Ross the Boss, a former member of the punk rock band the Dictators, was the guitar player in Black Sabbath&#x27;s support band, Shakin&#x27; Street. The two bonded over their shared musical interests, became friends and decided to form a band with the suggestion and advice of Black Sabbath&#x27;s singer Ronnie James Dio during the tour. At the end of the tour with Black Sabbath, the duo got together to form Manowar. To complete the roster, they hired drummer Donnie Hamzik and singer Eric Adams, a former classmate and friend of DeMaio. Adams&#x27;s real name is Louis Marullo; Ross the Boss proposed him to use a stage name instead, and he chose &quot;Eric Adams&quot; as an homage to his sons Eric and Adam. The name Manowar was suggested to Joey DeMaio and Ross the Boss by their instrument designer, John &quot;Dawk&quot; Stillwell, while DeMaio and The Boss were brainstorming possible names. The name is a shortened version of the phrase &quot;Man of war&quot;, and although it may be understood as a reference to the Man-of-war naval ships, DeMaio simply chose it as a synonym of &quot;Warrior&quot;.

===&quot;Battle Hymns&quot; (1981–1982)===
The band recorded a demo after its creating. It was enough to secure a recording contract with label Liberty Records in 1981. The debut album, &quot;Battle Hymns&quot;, was released the following year. As the song &quot;Dark Avenger&quot; required an introductory narration, the band wanted to include a famous actor in it. Executive producer Bob Currie contacted the manager of Orson Welles, who was open to the idea. He recorded two narrations for the band, &quot;Dark Avenger&quot; and &quot;Defender&quot;.

Soon after the album&#x27;s release, Manowar engaged in their first tour. The band played support for hard rocker Ted Nugent, but their collaboration lasted only a few months. Manowar then decided to put together a short tour by themselves and all the arrangements were made in a few weeks by their manager. Despite these setbacks, the band gained domestic fame on this short tour and also began to get their first European fans, particularly in the United Kingdom and in Germany. Stressed from the strain of the continuing performances, Hamzik decided to leave the band at the end of this tour and was replaced with Scott Columbus.

===&quot;Into Glory Ride&quot; and mainstream success (1983–1988)===
By 1983, the band left Liberty Records and struck a deal with Megaforce Records in the US and Music for Nations in Europe—signing the contract in their own blood, to make a stance against the music industry they felt slighted by. The signing was a cover story in the 1983 July–August issue No. 47 of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;.

When Manowar returned home, they immediately went into a recording studio to produce what, in the intentions of the group, would have been a simple EP, but came out instead, due to the quantity and quality of the tracks made in that period, as the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Into Glory Ride&quot;. An EP was actually published in 1983 with the title &quot;Defender&quot; containing, as its main track, the eponymous song, which included more work by Orson Welles. The atmosphere of the album evoked classical heroic fantasy and mythology, and served as a predecessor to Viking metal. It contained several innovative features, both in style and sound, and led to a huge increase in the number of fans of the group, particularly in the United Kingdom, where the band planned a long tour that was ultimately canceled. The song &quot;Defender&quot; was later re-recorded and included in the &quot;Fighting the World&quot; album of 1987.

To apologize for the failure of their UK tour, Manowar decided to dedicate their next album to the United Kingdom. The album, &quot;Hail to England&quot;, was recorded and mixed in just six days and was released in early 1984.

Manowar soon returned to work in the recording studio. After leaving Music for Nations, the quartet released &quot;Sign of the Hammer&quot; ten months after their previous album.

Following further disagreements with their new label, the group changed record label to Atlantic Records in 1987. Via Atlantic, they released &quot;Fighting the World&quot;, which enjoyed more extensive distribution and increased the band&#x27;s prominence in the international heavy metal scene. Album art was designed by Ken Kelly.

In 1988, Manowar released the album &quot;Kings of Metal&quot;, which is the band&#x27;s best known work. Songs like &quot;Heart of Steel&quot;, &quot;Kings of Metal&quot; and &quot;Hail and Kill&quot; are performed regularly in concerts. &quot;Kings of Metal&quot; is Manowar&#x27;s highest-selling album worldwide.

Manowar embarked on a world tour, for a period of approximately three years, with stops in almost all European nations. During that tour, Joey DeMaio &quot;fired&quot; Ross the Boss. According to a 2008 interview with the guitarist, &quot;Joey felt that Manowar would be better without me&quot;. He was replaced by David Shankle, who was chosen by members of the band after a search among about 150 candidates. Scott Columbus later also decided to leave the band during the Kings of Metal tour. Columbus himself picked his replacement Kenny Earl Edwards (soon nicknamed &#x27;Rhino&#x27;).

===New albums, first video, and live publications (1992–2002)===
A new musical unit after the recent changes, Manowar released &quot;The Triumph of Steel&quot; in 1992. It gained some success and was particularly famous for the presence of a suite lasting no less than 28 minutes entitled &quot;Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts&quot;, inspired by the events of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the hero Achilles. After this release, the band went on a world tour for two years. After the expiration of their contract with Atlantic, the band signed with Geffen Records. In 1994, Shankle unexpectedly left the band to form his own group. He was replaced by Karl Logan, a musician met by DeMaio during a motor meeting. The same year saw the unexpected return of Scott Columbus, who replaced Edwards.

In 1996, they released &quot;Louder Than Hell&quot;, their first new studio album in four years. Despite good sales the album was criticized for its simple style.

Despite such criticisms, Manowar released a new collection, called &quot;Anthology&quot;, and their first live album, &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;, released by BMG International in the guise of a double CD containing all the most popular songs of the group. Not having the time to record a new studio album because of the ongoing promotional tour, Manowar released a second live album, &quot;Hell on Stage&quot;.

===&quot;Warriors of the World&quot;, &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;, and Magic Circle Music (2002–2005)===
In 2002, six years after the last studio album, Manowar released the &quot;Warriors of the World&quot; album. &quot;Warriors of the World&quot; presented a sound somewhat renewed in style, but maintained the usual energy and power. The most famous tracks from the album became &quot;Warriors of the World United&quot;, &quot;House of Death&quot; and &quot;Call to Arms&quot;, in addition to Puccini&#x27;s aria &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;, covered in honor of the Italian fans and sung live for the first time in a concert in Milan, Italy.

Manowar then began a long world tour, called &quot;Warriors of the World United Tour&quot; that kept them busy and away from a recording studio for a long time. To compensate for the lack of studio albums, the band released several DVDs: in 2002 the video &quot;Fire and Blood&quot;, in 2003 &quot;Hell on Earth Part III&quot; and in 2005 &quot;Hell on Earth Part IV&quot;. These (and all DVDs since the year 2000) were directed by Neil Johnson, and have all been certified Gold in Germany.

In 2003, DeMaio founded his own record label, Magic Circle Music, which became the official home of the band, having been created to fit the needs of Manowar, and other bands of similar genre. Under the label Magic Circle were also released the EP &quot;The Sons of Odin&quot; with footage taken during the Earthshaker Fest 2005.

===&quot;Gods of War&quot; and &quot;Thunder in the Sky&quot; (2006–2009)===
Manowar released &quot;Gods of War&quot; through Magic Circle Music in 2007. After playing numerous shows in Europe, including a concert that spanned the course of two nights, they worked on a new EP, entitled &quot;Thunder in the Sky&quot;, which was released in 2009. The EP consisted of two discs: the first playing the regular track list; the second playing the song &quot;Father&quot; in fifteen different languages.

===Scott Columbus&#x27; death, &quot;Battle Hymns MMXI&quot;, and &quot;The Lord of Steel&quot; (2010–2013)===
On June 1, 2010, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine published an interview with drummer Scott Columbus who said that he had not worked with the band since April 2008 and had left the band. He also said that statements made in the past, regarding his break in 1990 and 2008 because of an illness and a personal tragedy, were largely untrue and were made without his agreement. On October 15, 2010, Joey DeMaio announced on Facebook that Hamzik was officially a member of Manowar again after a 26-year absence.

On April 4, 2011, Columbus died at the age of 54. On April 5, 2020, Columbus&#x27; daughter Teresa publicly announced that her father&#x27;s cause of death was suicide, and urged for more awareness on mental illness and depression.

Manowar&#x27;s subsequent release was a re-recording of their 1982 debut album &quot;Battle Hymns&quot;. This album was released on November 26, 2010, with the narration of Sir Christopher Lee and formally entitled &quot;Battle Hymns MMXI&quot;. On July 21, 2011, the band embarked on a UK tour for the first time in 16 years in November and performed the &quot;Battle Hymns&quot; album in its entirety.

Manowar&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;The Lord of Steel&quot;, was released worldwide on June 16, 2012, exclusively on iTunes and on the band&#x27;s own online store. The album sees a reversion from the symphonic elements present on the &quot;Gods of War&quot; album back to a more straightforward, heavy metal sound. The song &quot;El Gringo&quot; is featured in the soundtrack to the film of the same name.

After the Lord of Steel tour was over in 2013, Manowar released a live EP, titled &quot;The Lord of Steel Live&quot;, which included six live tracks recorded during the tour.

===&quot;Kings of Metal MMXIV&quot; (2013–2014)===
On July 28, 2013, Manowar announced that they would be re-recording their 1988 release &quot;Kings of Metal&quot; with an expected release date of late 2013. Brian Blessed recorded his narration for the track &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Prayer&quot; at Circle (Recording) Studios in Birmingham, England. Like the re-recording of &quot;Battle Hymns MMXI&quot;, this album allowed the band to use modern day technology.

&quot;Kings of Metal MMXIV&quot; was released through iTunes as a digital download on February 4, 2014. Hard copies of the album were released on February 28.

The embarked on a world tour in support of the album in 2014.

===Upcoming twelfth studio album, Logan&#x27;s arrest, and continued touring (2015–present)===
On May 22, 2015, Manowar announced that they were currently working on a new studio album that was set to be released in early 2016. This album was not released, and instead they went to Europe in early 2016 for the &quot;Gods and Kings World Tour 2016&quot; which included their first concerts in Slovakia, Latvia and Belarus.

On May 25, 2016, the band announced that they would embark on their next world tour dubbed &quot;The Final Battle&quot;. They would later recruit drummer Marcus Castellani from the tribute band Kings of Steel as their drummer for the tour.

On October 25, 2018, it was revealed that guitarist Karl Logan was arrested on August 9 in Charlotte, North Carolina, for allegedly possessing child pornography and was charged with six counts of third-degree exploitation of a minor. Manowar issued a statement shortly after saying that Logan would not perform with them. They then said that their upcoming album and tour would not be affected. Following Logan&#x27;s arrest, former guitarist David Shankle expressed interest in rejoining the band.

On January 1, 2019, Manowar announced that guitarist E. V. Martel would join them on their tour. On March 22, 2019, the band announced that they would release a trilogy of EP&#x27;s based upon The Final Battle World Tour. The first EP, &quot;The Final Battle I&quot;, was released on March 29 in an exclusive pre-sale at the merchandise booth in Frankfurt and also during the European shows. It was then released on iTunes worldwide that day. The EP was digitally and physically released on May 30. Former HammerFall and Yngwie Malmsteen drummer Anders Johansson was announced as the new live drummer shortly after and made his debut at the March 25 show in Brno. Despite the tour&#x27;s name, bassist Joey DeMaio dismissed any claims of Manowar&#x27;s retirement, mainly due to the fans&#x27; demands to have them continue to perform.

In June 2019, the band&#x27;s appearance at Hellfest was cancelled for undisclosed reasons. Fans who were to attend the show expressed their disappointment towards their cancellation. Manowar stepped in and said that they did not cancel their performance, but that it was the festival&#x27;s organizers who cancelled their appearance in an announcement that appeared on their website. Swedish band Sabaton replaced Manowar in the lineup. Joey DeMaio later said that the band filed a lawsuit against the Hellfest organizers.

In May 2020, Manowar announced that they would embark on a tour, beginning in April 2021 in Europe, to celebrate their 40th anniversary. However, the band did not tour in 2020 and 2021.

On June 4, 2022, the day of the first show of their 2022/23 tour, it was announced drummer Anders Johansson could not perform with the band on their upcoming &quot;Crushing The Enemies of Metal Anniversary Tour &#x27;22/&#x27;23&quot; due to family commitments, and was replaced by Dave Chedrick for the tour. On September 2, 2022, following the announcement by guitarist E. V. Martel that he would not be available for touring next year, the band announced Michael Angelo Batio as their touring guitarist for their upcoming 2023 &quot;Crushing The Enemies Of Metal&quot; Anniversary Tour. On October 15, 2023, the band announced that in 2024 they will re-record their album &quot;Sign of the hammer&quot; to be released under the title &quot;Sign of the Hammer 2024&quot;, while also confirming that their new long-awaited still untitled studio album will be released in 2025. However, as of 2025 there is no news about this re-recording of Sign of the Hammer. In January 2025 the band started their new tour called &quot;The Blood of Our Enemies Tour 2025&quot; where at first they will play a mix of their 1984 album Hail to England and 1985 album Sign of the Hammer plus their greatest hits and starting in early February they will start performing the albums in their entirety on alternating nights.

===Timeline===
== The Faceless Warrior ==
The Faceless Warrior, also known as the King of Metal, is the band&#x27;s mascot. The character first appeared in 1988 on the cover of the album &quot;Kings of Metal&quot;, and has since appeared in the cover artwork of almost every following Manowar album, as well as on merchandise and in almost every Manowar live show to follow.

In a May 2002 interview with Metal-Rules.com, vocalist Eric Adams was asked, &quot;Who is that guy in your album cover? Do you have any name for him?&quot;. He replied, &quot;No because he is you, he is her, he is this person he is that person and so on. He has no face and that was in [sic] purpose because everyone needs a heroes [sic] in their life and our music is all about heroes and you know being the leader not the follower. It&#x27;s picture [sic] of hero and you being that hero is that what it is all about. So there is no real name for it. It&#x27;s a fantasy world man. Put your face there are you are the hero!&quot;

== The Sign of the Hammer ==
&quot;The Sign of the Hammer&quot; is a cultural gesture developed in the early years of the band, after the release of their fourth album of the same name, and serves as a signature of the band: It is formed by raising the right fist above the head, while using the left hand to grab the back of the right wrist. The sign is most likely to have been shaped from the vocalist Eric Adams. The Media Company &quot;Heilbronner Stimme&quot; published an article describing the Sign of the Hammer as, &quot;the striking greeting. A gesture that unites. A gesture that fits the pathos of the self-proclaimed Kings of Metal. A gesture that has become the trademark of the group founded in 1980&quot;.

The first official appearance of the gesture was on the front cover of the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Fighting the World&quot;, where vocalist Eric Adams is shown making the gesture in a drawing of the band members. The gesture then appeared in the official music video for &quot;Blow Your Speakers&quot;, shown being made by the band members and crowd during a concert, as well as in the full cover art of the album &quot;The Triumph of Steel&quot;. Since then, the sign has been featured in almost every official music video of the band.

<doc id="54648" wikidata="Q119830" url="?curid=54648" title="Solar flare">
<text>A solar flare is a relatively intense, localized emission of electromagnetic radiation in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere. Flares occur in active regions and are often, but not always, accompanied by coronal mass ejections, solar particle events, and other eruptive solar phenomena. The occurrence of solar flares varies with the 11-year solar cycle.

Solar flares are thought to occur when stored magnetic energy in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere accelerates charged particles in the surrounding plasma. This results in the emission of electromagnetic radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum.

The extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from solar flares is absorbed by the daylight side of Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere, in particular the ionosphere, and does not reach the surface. This absorption can temporarily increase the ionization of the ionosphere which may interfere with short-wave radio communication. The prediction of solar flares is an active area of research.

Flares also occur on other stars, where the term &quot;stellar flare&quot; applies.

== Physical description ==

Solar flares are eruptions of electromagnetic radiation originating in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere. They affect all layers of the solar atmosphere (photosphere, chromosphere, and corona). The plasma medium is heated to &gt;107 kelvin, while electrons, protons, and heavier ions are accelerated to near the speed of light. Flares emit electromagnetic radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays.

Flares occur in active regions, often around sunspots, where intense magnetic fields penetrate the photosphere to link the corona to the solar interior. Flares are powered by the sudden (timescales of minutes to tens of minutes) release of magnetic energy stored in the corona. The same energy releases may also produce coronal mass ejections (CMEs), although the relationship between CMEs and flares is not well understood.

Associated with solar flares are flare sprays. They involve faster ejections of material than eruptive prominences, and reach velocities of 20 to 2000 kilometers per second.

=== Cause ===
Flares occur when accelerated charged particles, mainly electrons, interact with the plasma medium. Evidence suggests that the phenomenon of magnetic reconnection leads to this extreme acceleration of charged particles. On the Sun, magnetic reconnection may happen on solar arcades – a type of prominence consisting of a series of closely occurring loops following magnetic lines of force. These lines of force quickly reconnect into a lower arcade of loops leaving a helix of magnetic field unconnected to the rest of the arcade. The sudden release of energy in this reconnection is the origin of the particle acceleration. The unconnected magnetic helical field and the material that it contains may violently expand outwards forming a coronal mass ejection. This also explains why solar flares typically erupt from active regions on the Sun where magnetic fields are much stronger.

Although there is a general agreement on the source of a flare&#x27;s energy, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. It is not clear how the magnetic energy is transformed into the kinetic energy of the particles, nor is it known how some particles can be accelerated to the GeV range (109 electron volt) and beyond. There are also some inconsistencies regarding the total number of accelerated particles, which sometimes seems to be greater than the total number in the coronal loop.

=== Post-eruption loops and arcades ===
After the eruption of a solar flare, post-eruption loops made of hot plasma begin to form across the neutral line separating regions of opposite magnetic polarity near the flare&#x27;s source. These loops extend from the photosphere up into the corona and form along the neutral line at increasingly greater distances from the source as time progresses. The existence of these hot loops is thought to be continued by prolonged heating present after the eruption and during the flare&#x27;s decay stage.

In sufficiently powerful flares, typically of C-class or higher, the loops may combine to form an elongated arch-like structure known as a post-eruption arcade. These structures may last anywhere from multiple hours to multiple days after the initial flare. In some cases, dark sunward-traveling plasma voids known as supra-arcade downflows may form above these arcades.

== Frequency ==
The frequency of occurrence of solar flares varies with the 11-year solar cycle. It can typically range from several per day during solar maxima to less than one every week during solar minima. Additionally, more powerful flares are less frequent than weaker ones. For example, X10-class (severe) flares occur on average about eight times per cycle, whereas M1-class (minor) flares occur on average about 2000 times per cycle.

Erich Rieger discovered with coworkers in 1984, an approximately 154 day period in the occurrence of gamma-ray emitting solar flares at least since the solar cycle 19. The period has since been confirmed in most heliophysics data and the interplanetary magnetic field and is commonly known as the &quot;Rieger period&quot;. The period&#x27;s resonance harmonics also have been reported from most data types in the heliosphere.

The frequency distributions of various flare phenomena can be characterized by power-law distributions. For example, the peak fluxes of radio, extreme ultraviolet, and hard and soft X-ray emissions; total energies; and flare durations (see ) have been found to follow power-law distributions.

== Classification ==
=== Soft X-ray ===

The modern classification system for solar flares uses the letters A, B, C, M, or X, according to the peak flux in watts per square metre (W/m2) of soft X-rays with wavelengths , as measured by GOES satellites in geosynchronous orbit.

The strength of an event within a class is noted by a numerical suffix ranging from 1 up to, but excluding, 10, which is also the factor for that event within the class. Hence, an X2 flare is twice the strength of an X1 flare, an X3 flare is three times as powerful as an X1. M-class flares are a tenth the size of X-class flares with the same numeric suffix. An X2 is four times more powerful than an M5 flare. X-class flares with a peak flux that exceeds 10−3 W/m2 may be noted with a numerical suffix equal to or greater than 10.

This system was originally devised in 1970 and included only the letters C, M, and X. These letters were chosen to avoid confusion with other optical classification systems. The A and B classes were added in the 1990s as instruments became more sensitive to weaker flares. Around the same time, the backronym &quot;moderate&quot; for M-class flares and &quot;extreme&quot; for X-class flares began to be used.

=== Importance ===
An earlier classification system, sometimes referred to as the &quot;flare importance&quot;, was based on H-alpha spectral observations. The scheme uses both the intensity and emitting surface. The classification in intensity is qualitative, referring to the flares as: faint (f), normal (n), or brilliant (b). The emitting surface is measured in terms of millionths of the hemisphere and is described below. (The total hemisphere area &quot;AH&quot; = 15.5 × 1012 km2.)

A flare is then classified taking S or a number that represents its size and a letter that represents its peak intensity, v.g.: Sn is a normal sunflare.

=== Duration ===
A common measure of flare duration is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) time of flux in the soft X-ray bands measured by GOES. The FWHM time spans from when a flare&#x27;s flux first reaches halfway between its maximum flux and the background flux and when it again reaches this value as the flare decays. Using this measure, the duration of a flare ranges from approximately tens of seconds to several hours with a median duration of approximately 6 and 11 minutes in the bands, respectively.

Flares can also be classified based on their duration as either impulsive or long duration events (LDE). The time threshold separating the two is not well defined. The SWPC regards events requiring 30 minutes or more to decay to half maximum as LDEs, whereas Belgium&#x27;s Solar-Terrestrial Centre of Excellence regards events with duration greater than 60 minutes as LDEs.

== Effects ==

The electromagnetic radiation emitted during a solar flare propagates away from the Sun at the speed of light with intensity inversely proportional to the square of the distance from its source region. The excess ionizing radiation, namely X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation, is known to affect planetary atmospheres and is of relevance to human space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life.

Solar flares also affect other objects in the Solar System. Research into these effects has primarily focused on the atmosphere of Mars and, to a lesser extent, that of Venus. The impacts on other planets in the Solar System are little studied in comparison. As of 2024, research on their effects on Mercury have been limited to modeling of the response of ions in the planet&#x27;s magnetosphere, and their impact on Jupiter and Saturn have only been studied in the context of X-ray radiation back scattering off of the planets&#x27; upper atmospheres.

=== Ionosphere ===
Enhanced XUV irradiance during solar flares can result in increased ionization, dissociation, and heating in the ionospheres of Earth and Earth-like planets. On Earth, these changes to the upper atmosphere, collectively referred to as &quot;sudden ionospheric disturbances&quot;, can interfere with short-wave radio communication and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as GPS, and subsequent expansion of the upper atmosphere can increase drag on satellites in low Earth orbit leading to orbital decay over time.

Flare-associated XUV photons interact with and ionize neutral constituents of planetary atmospheres via the process of photoionization. The electrons that are freed in this process, referred to as &quot;photoelectrons&quot; to distinguish them from the ambient ionospheric electrons, are left with kinetic energies equal to the photon energy in excess of the ionization threshold. In the lower ionosphere where flare impacts are greatest and transport phenomena are less important, the newly liberated photoelectrons lose energy primarily via thermalization with the ambient electrons and neutral species and via secondary ionization due to collisions with the latter, or so-called &quot;photoelectron impact ionization&quot;. In the process of thermalization, photoelectrons transfer energy to neutral species, resulting in heating and expansion of the neutral atmosphere. The greatest increases in ionization occur in the lower ionosphere where wavelengths with the greatest relative increase in irradiance—the highly penetrative X-ray wavelengths—are absorbed, corresponding to Earth&#x27;s E and D layers and Mars&#x27;s M1 layer.

==== Radio blackouts ====

The temporary increase in ionization of the daylight side of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, in particular the D layer of the ionosphere, can interfere with short-wave radio communications that rely on its level of ionization for skywave propagation. Skywave, or skip, refers to the propagation of radio waves reflected or refracted off of the ionized ionosphere. When ionization is higher than normal, radio waves get degraded or completely absorbed by losing energy from the more frequent collisions with free electrons.

The level of ionization of the atmosphere correlates with the strength of the associated solar flare in soft X-ray radiation. The Space Weather Prediction Center, a part of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, classifies radio blackouts by the peak soft X-ray intensity of the associated flare.
==== Solar flare effect ====
During non-flaring or solar quiet conditions, electric currents flow through the ionosphere&#x27;s dayside E layer inducing small-amplitude diurnal variations in the geomagnetic field. These ionospheric currents can be strengthened during large solar flares due to increases in electrical conductivity associated with enhanced ionization of the E and D layers. The subsequent increase in the induced geomagnetic field variation is referred to as a solar flare effect (sfe) or historically as a magnetic crochet. The latter term derives from the French word meaning &quot;hook&quot; reflecting the hook-like disturbances in magnetic field strength observed by ground-based magnetometers. These disturbances are on the order of a few nanoteslas and last for a few minutes, which is relatively minor compared to those induced during geomagnetic storms.

=== Health ===
==== Low Earth orbit ====
For astronauts in low Earth orbit, an expected radiation dose from the electromagnetic radiation emitted during a solar flare is about 0.05 gray, which is not immediately lethal on its own. Of much more concern for astronauts is the particle radiation associated with solar particle events.

==== Mars ====
The impacts of solar flare radiation on Mars are relevant to exploration and the search for life on the planet. Models of its atmosphere indicate that the most energetic solar flares previously recorded may have provided acute doses of radiation that would have been almost harmful or lethal to mammals and other higher organisms on Mars&#x27;s surface. Furthermore, flares energetic enough to provide lethal doses, while not yet observed on the Sun, are thought to occur and have been observed on other Sun-like stars.

== Observational history ==

Flares produce radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, although with different intensity. They are not very intense in visible light, but they can be very bright at particular spectral lines. They normally produce bremsstrahlung in X-rays and synchrotron radiation in radio.

=== Optical observations ===

Solar flares were first observed by Richard Carrington and Richard Hodgson independently on 1 September 1859 by projecting the image of the solar disk produced by an optical telescope through a broad-band filter. It was an extraordinarily intense &quot;white light flare&quot;, a flare emitting a high amount of light in the visual spectrum.

Since flares produce copious amounts of radiation at H-alpha, adding a narrow (≈1 Å) passband filter centered at this wavelength to the optical telescope allows the observation of not very bright flares with small telescopes. For years Hα was the main, if not the only, source of information about solar flares. Other passband filters are also used.

=== Radio observations ===
During World War II, on February 25 and 26, 1942, British radar operators observed radiation that Stanley Hey interpreted as solar emission. Their discovery did not go public until the end of the conflict. The same year, Southworth also observed the Sun in radio, but as with Hey, his observations were only known after 1945. In 1943, Grote Reber was the first to report radioastronomical observations of the Sun at 160 MHz. The fast development of radioastronomy revealed new peculiarities of the solar activity like &quot;storms&quot; and &quot;bursts&quot; related to the flares. Today, ground-based radiotelescopes observe the Sun from c. 15 MHz up to 400 GHz.

=== Space telescopes ===
Because the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere absorbs much of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun with wavelengths shorter than 300 nm, space-based telescopes allowed for the observation of solar flares in previously unobserved high-energy spectral lines. Since the 1970s, the GOES series of satellites have been continuously observing the Sun in soft X-rays, and their observations have become the standard measure of flares, diminishing the importance of the H-alpha classification. Additionally, space-based telescopes allow for the observation of extremely long wavelengths—as long as a few kilometres—which cannot propagate through the ionosphere.

=== Examples of large solar flares ===

The most powerful flare ever observed is thought to be the flare associated with the 1859 Carrington Event. While no soft X-ray measurements were made at the time, the magnetic crochet associated with the flare was recorded by ground-based magnetometers allowing the flare&#x27;s strength to be estimated after the event. Using these magnetometer readings, its soft X-ray class has been estimated to be greater than X10 and around X45 (±5).

In modern times, the largest solar flare measured with instruments occurred on 4 November 2003. This event saturated the GOES detectors, and because of this, its classification is only approximate. Initially, extrapolating the GOES curve, it was estimated to be X28. Later analysis of the ionospheric effects suggested increasing this estimate to X45. This event produced the first clear evidence of a new spectral component above 100 GHz.

== Prediction ==
Current methods of flare prediction are problematic, and there is no certain indication that an active region on the Sun will produce a flare. However, many properties of active regions and their sunspots correlate with flaring. For example, magnetically complex regions (based on line-of-sight magnetic field) referred to as &quot;delta spots&quot; frequently produce the largest flares. A simple scheme of sunspot classification based on the McIntosh system for sunspot groups, or related to a region&#x27;s fractal complexity is commonly used as a starting point for flare prediction. Predictions are usually stated in terms of probabilities for occurrence of flares above M- or X-class within 24 or 48 hours. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issues forecasts of this kind. MAG4 was developed at the University of Alabama in Huntsville with support from the Space Radiation Analysis Group at Johnson Space Flight Center (NASA/SRAG) for forecasting M- and X-class flares, CMEs, fast CME, and solar energetic particle events. A physics-based method that can predict imminent large solar flares was proposed by Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research (ISEE), Nagoya University.

<text>A chromosphere (&quot;sphere of color&quot;, from the Ancient Greek words χρῶμα (&quot;khrôma&quot;) &#x27;color&#x27; and σφαῖρα (&quot;sphaîra&quot;) &#x27;sphere&#x27;) is the second layer of a star&#x27;s atmosphere, located above the photosphere and below the solar transition region and corona. The term usually refers to the Sun&#x27;s chromosphere, but not exclusively, since it also refers to the corresponding layer of a stellar atmosphere. The name was suggested by the English astronomer Norman Lockyer after conducting systematic solar observations in order to distinguish the layer from the white-light emitting photosphere. 

In the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere, the chromosphere is roughly in height, or slightly more than 1% of the Sun&#x27;s radius at maximum thickness. It possesses a homogeneous layer at the boundary with the photosphere. Narrow jets of plasma, called spicules, rise from this homogeneous region and through the chromosphere, extending up to into the corona above.

The chromosphere has a characteristic red color due to electromagnetic emissions in the &quot;H&quot;α spectral line. Information about the chromosphere is primarily obtained by analysis of its emitted electromagnetic radiation. The chromosphere is also visible in the light emitted by ionized calcium, Ca II, in the violet part of the solar spectrum at a wavelength of 393.4 nanometers (the Calcium K-line).

Chromospheres have also been observed on stars other than the Sun. On large stars, chromospheres sometimes make up a significant proportion of the entire star. For example, the chromosphere of supergiant star Antares has been found to be about 2.5 times larger in thickness than the star&#x27;s radius.

== Physical properties ==

The density of the Sun&#x27;s chromosphere decreases exponentially with distance from the center of the Sun by a factor of roughly 10 million, from about at the chromosphere&#x27;s inner boundary to under at the outer boundary. The temperature initially decreases from the inner boundary at about to a minimum of approximately , but then increasing to upwards of at the outer boundary with the transition layer of the corona (see ).

The density of the chromosphere is 10−4 times that of the underlying photosphere and 10−8 times that of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at sea level. This makes the chromosphere normally invisible and it can be seen only during a total eclipse, where its reddish colour is revealed. The colour hues are anywhere between pink and red. Without special equipment, the chromosphere cannot normally be seen due to the overwhelming brightness of the photosphere.

The chromosphere&#x27;s spectrum is dominated by emission lines when observed at the solar limb. In particular, one of its strongest lines is the &quot;H&quot;α at a wavelength of ; this line is emitted by a hydrogen atom whenever its electron makes a transition from the &quot;n&quot;=3 to the &quot;n&quot;=2 energy level. A wavelength of is in the red part of the spectrum, which causes the chromosphere to have a characteristic reddish colour. 

== Phenomena ==

Many different phenomena can be observed in chromospheres.

=== Plage ===

A plage is a particularly bright region within stellar chromospheres, which are often associated with magnetic activity.

=== Spicules ===

The most commonly identified feature in the solar chromosphere are spicules. Spicules rise to the top of the chromosphere and then sink back down again over the course of about 10 minutes.

=== Oscillations ===

Since the first observations with the instrument SUMER on board SOHO, periodic oscillations in the solar chromosphere have been found with a frequency from to , corresponding to a characteristic periodic time of three minutes. Oscillations of the radial component of the plasma velocity are typical of the high chromosphere. The photospheric granulation pattern usually has no oscillations above ; however, higher frequency waves (, or a period) were detected in the solar atmosphere (at temperatures typical of the transition region and corona) by TRACE.

=== Loops ===

Plasma loops can be seen at the border of the solar disk in the chromosphere. They are different from solar prominences because they are concentric arches with maximum temperature of the order (too low to be considered coronal features). These cool-temperature loops show an intense variability: they appear and disappear in some UV lines in a time less than an hour, or they rapidly expand in 10–20 minutes. Foukal studied these cool loops in detail from the observations taken with the EUV spectrometer on Skylab in 1976. When the plasma temperature of these loops becomes coronal (above ), these features appear more stable and evolve over longer times.

== Network ==

Images taken in typical chromospheric lines show the presence of brighter cells, usually referred to as the &quot;network&quot;, while the surrounding darker regions are named &quot;internetwork&quot;. They look similar to granules commonly observed on the photosphere due to the heat convection.

== On other stars ==

Chromospheres are present on almost all luminous stars other than white dwarfs. They are most prominent and magnetically active on lower-main sequence stars, on brown dwarfs of F and later spectral types, and on giant and subgiant stars.

A spectroscopic measure of chromospheric activity on other stars is the Mount Wilson S-index.

<doc id="54663" wikidata="Q3235376" url="?curid=54663" title="You Can't Do That on Television">
<text>You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television is a Canadian sketch comedy television series that aired locally in 1979 before airing in the United States in 1981. It featured adolescent and teenage actors performing in a sketch comedy format similar to America&#x27;s &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; and Canada&#x27;s &quot;Second City Television&quot;. Each episode had a specific theme, typically relating to the popular culture of the time.

The series was produced by and aired on Ottawa&#x27;s CTV station CJOH-TV. Initially a local program, it was marketed specifically for a North American-wide audience from its third season on. It was staple on the early years of the American cable network Nickelodeon, becoming most famous for introducing the network&#x27;s iconic green slime. The channel aired reruns through 1994, when they were replaced with the similarly-themed domestic sketch comedy variety program &quot;All That&quot;. The show was notable for launching the careers of many performers, including alternative rock musician Alanis Morissette, filmmaker Patrick Mills, and television producer and screenwriter Bill Prady.

The show is the subject of the 2004 indie documentary &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Film&quot;, directed by David Dillehunt. Filmed in August 2004, the documentary was released in North America by Shout! Factory in 2012 and reissued in 2022 by MVD Entertainment. The film&#x27;s tour of Studio D at CJOH was the final production made in the original studio, as the space had been sealed for tax purposes by station management. The building was demolished in 2011 following a fire in February 2010.

The first 21 half-hour episodes were released on iTunes and Amazon in three volumes, beginning in December 2012, but these volumes are no longer available. In 2021, the first 14 half-hour episodes were made available on Paramount+. Outside of the 1989 &quot;Worst of You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; VHS from Elektra Video, the series has never been formally released on home media.

== History ==
=== Local television ===
&quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; premiered on February 3, 1979, on CJOH-TV in Ottawa. It was a locally produced, one-hour, low-budget variety program with some segments performed live. The show consisted of comedy sketches, music videos, and live phone-in contests in which the viewer could win prizes such as transistor radios, record albums, model kits, etc. The format also included performances by local disco dancers and special guests such as Ottawa-based cartoonist Jim Unger. Each week, the show took its &quot;roving camera&quot; to hangouts around town, recording kids&#x27; jokes or complaints about life, which were played on the following week&#x27;s broadcast. The show also benefited from links with popular Top 40 Ottawa radio station CFGO. For example, station personality Jim Johnson emceed the disco-dance segments and shared tidbits about the artists featured in music videos.

Veteran comedy actor Les Lye played numerous recurring characters and was initially the only adult to perform in the show&#x27;s sketches. He was the only actor to appear for the entire series&#x27; run. Actress Abby Hagyard, who played the maternal character &quot;Valerie&quot; opposite Lye&#x27;s paternal role &quot;Lance,&quot; joined the series in 1982. Occasionally, the older children in the cast (including Christine McGlade, Sarah West or Cyndi Kennedy) played adult characters.

The show offered programming for children on Saturday mornings that made no attempt to be an educational program. The idea was successful, as (according to one episode) the show scored a 32 share of the ratings for CJOH in its 10:30 a.m. Saturday time slot. The studio masters for the first-season episodes no longer exist, and all but three of the episodes from the first season were believed lost until early 2013, when copies of the missing episodes from off-air recordings were contributed by Roger Price and posted on YouTube.

The format was similar to &quot;You Must Be Joking!&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Serious&quot;, children&#x27;s sketch variety shows that Price created and produced for Thames Television in Britain from 1974 to 1978.

=== National television in Canada ===
After a successful first season, a national network version of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; entitled Whatever Turns You On was produced for CTV and debuted in September 1979 (its hour-long pilot episode had aired in May). The show&#x27;s creators shortened it to 30 minutes, removed local content, and added a laugh track. They replaced music videos with live performances from popular Canadian artists including Trooper, Max Webster, Ian Thomas, Ottawa&#x27;s own Cooper Brothers (one of whose members, Dick Cooper, later became a writer for &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;) and disco singer Alma Faye Brooks. Ruth Buzzi joined the cast playing many of the adult female characters, including a strict schoolteacher named Miss Fidt and the studio secretary Miss Take. In addition, the 22 children from the first season were trimmed down to seven: Christine McGlade, Lisa Ruddy, Jonothan Gebert, Kevin Somers, Kevin Schenk, Rodney Helal and Marc Baillon. Another first-season cast member, Elizabeth Mitchell, only appeared in the pilot episode. The show was placed in the 7:00 p.m. timeslot on Tuesday nights, and some CTV affiliates opted not to carry the show, possibly because of concerns about its content. As a result, CTV cancelled the show in December 1979 following poor ratings after only 13 episodes.

In January 1981, production on &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; resumed, and a new set of episodes aired locally on CJOH through May 1981. The format of the 1981 episodes was similar to that of the inaugural 1979 season, but each episode featured sketches that revolved around a certain topic (something that carried over from &quot;Whatever Turns You On&quot;). As disco&#x27;s popularity had waned, the dancers were replaced by video-game competitions.

At that time, Price and Darby tried to syndicate &quot;YCDTOTV.&quot; They edited each 1981 episode into a half-hour format similar to that of &quot;Whatever Turns You On&quot;. Some scenes were reshot to remove any specifically Canadian content, and the half-hour syndicated edits became entirely sketch comedy. The 1981 season was rerun on CJOH in early 1982 in the half-hour syndicated format. To compensate for the removal of local content, Price and Darby created a new local show for CJOH titled &quot;Something Else&quot;, which featured many of the &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; cast in a game show/variety format similar to that of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. The &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; team also made a pilot television film for Disney in 1981 titled &quot;Bear Rapids&quot; that was never picked up.

Four of the hour-long CJOH episodes from the 1981 season (&quot;Strike Now&quot;, &quot;Sexual Equality&quot;, &quot;Crime and Vandalism&quot;, and &quot;Peer Pressure&quot;) are available for public viewing on YouTube. The rest are only currently available in the half-hour edits.
=== Nickelodeon ===

==== Peak years ====
In 1981, the new American youth-oriented cable network Nickelodeon took an interest in &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;. Nickelodeon originally aired several episodes in the edited half-hour syndicated format as a test run. The response was positive, and in January 1982, Nickelodeon began airing the entire edited season. By 1983, &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; was the network&#x27;s highest-rated show.

Production on new episodes of &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; resumed full-time in 1982 in the half-hour all-comedy format, with Nickelodeon and CJOH as production partners. Over the next few years, the series was screened nationally in Canada. CTV, the network CJOH-TV was affiliated with, broadcast the show on Saturday mornings between 1982 and 1990, with little publicity. However, &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; continued to expand its audience in the United States on Nickelodeon, where it initially aired five times a week and eventually every day. The series gained broader exposure in its native Canada in 1988 when it was added by the newly established youth-oriented YTV cable channel. It was heavily promoted and aired daily during peak viewing hours.

Viewers in the United States were given the opportunity to enter the Slime-In, a contest hosted by Nickelodeon that flew the winner to the set of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; to be slimed. The contest was later replicated by Canada&#x27;s YTV as the Slime Light Sweepstakes.

In 1983 at WGBH-TV in Boston, Massachusetts, Roger Price created a version of &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; for American public television network PBS titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; (originally to be titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Your Mother!&quot;). The show was similar to episodes from the 1979 season of &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;, including music videos and several earlier &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; sketches and motifs (including a variation on the show&#x27;s trademark green slime gag called &quot;Yellow Yuck&quot;). Despite high ratings, the series ended after its five-episode trial run in October 1983, possibly because of complaints from parents about its content. Nickelodeon was also concerned that if &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Now&quot; was successful, it could mean the end of &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;. The series was believed lost until all five episodes surfaced in early 2013. They have been posted on YouTube, excluding the copyrighted music videos.

Price created another show for Nickelodeon in 1985, the less successful &quot;Turkey Television&quot;. It featured several main cast members of &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; including Les Lye, Christine McGlade, Kevin Kubusheskie and Adam Reid. By this time, McGlade, now in her twenties and eager to move on with her life, had moved to Toronto and was flying back to Ottawa for &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; taping sessions. &quot;Turkey Television&quot; also marked McGlade&#x27;s debut as a producer, a career that she continued after leaving &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; in 1986. Another Price production using &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; cast members, &quot;UFO Kidnapped&quot;, was made in 1983. Although the pilot aired on Nickelodeon, the series was not picked up.

==== Changing of the guard and controversies ====
By 1987, many of the veteran cast members such as Matthew Godfrey, Douglas Ptolemy, Vanessa Lindores and Adam Reid had grown too old for the show. Longtime host Christine McGlade (&quot;Moose&quot;) had departed the previous year, as had Alasdair Gillis (who had been promoted to co-host with McGlade in 1985 before leaving toward the end of the 1986 season). Lisa Ruddy (&quot;Motor Mouth&quot;), McGlade&#x27;s longtime sidekick on the show, left at the end of the 1985 season. Only five episodes were filmed for the 1987 season, tying with the 1990 season as the shortest during the show&#x27;s 15-year run.

The episode &quot;Adoption,&quot; was so controversial that it was banned after being shown twice. A &quot;DO NOT AIR&quot; sticker was placed on the master tape at CJOH. &quot;Adoption&quot; is the only episode that was banned in the United States. Co-creator Geoffrey Darby has stated that he felt the episode went too far, and that the writers were unaware of the sensitive nature of the material. In Canada, the &quot;Divorce&quot; episode was banned. However, the &quot;Adoption&quot; episode was shown with edits. In the sketch in which Senator Prevert calls the adoption agency to send his son back after using him to do chores all day, the line in which he calls the adoption agency officer a &quot;damn bureaucrat&quot; was excised.

In addition, Nickelodeon had removed the half-hour edits of the 1981 episodes of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; from its daily rotation, along with the 1982 &quot;Cosmetics&quot; episode. The 1981 episodes were set to air for the last time during a 1985-week-long promotion called &quot;Oldies but Moldies,&quot; with contests in which viewers could win prizes such as &quot;tasty, fresh chocolate syrup&quot;. Instead, the episodes continued to air until the end of 1987, but not often. Reportedly, this was because Nickelodeon&#x27;s six-year contract to air the 1981 season expired in 1987. As Nickelodeon was beginning to aim for a younger demographic, and many of the 1981 episodes dealt with topics more relevant to teenagers (such as smoking, drugs, sexual equality and peer pressure), the network opted not to renew the contract. Nickelodeon allegedly removed the &quot;Cosmetics&quot; episode from rotation for the latter reason (although the &quot;Addictions&quot; episode from that same season was not dropped). By contrast, when Canada&#x27;s YTV began airing the series in 1989, they continued airing the 1981 season as part of the package, as well as &quot;Whatever Turns You On&quot;, which was never shown in the United States.

==== Final years ====
Roger Price moved to France following production of the 1987 season after being informed that Nickelodeon was not planning to order more episodes. Production was suspended for 1988. When Price eventually returned to Canada, he wanted to resume production of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; from Toronto, but was convinced by the cast and crew to return to Ottawa and CJOH. Nickelodeon ordered more &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; episodes for the 1989 season. Auditions were held at CJOH in the spring of 1988, and taping began that fall. Amyas Godfrey and Andrea Byrne were the only child cast members to transition from 1987 to 1989. However, a few minor 1986 cast members returned for episodes, including Rekha Shah and James Tung.

Opinions regarding the 1989 and 1990 episodes of &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; are mixed among longtime fans of the show, particularly regarding the new episodes&#x27; increasing reliance on bathroom humor and more slime and water gags (which was supposedly at the request of Nickelodeon executives). The show did not completely sever ties to its past, as many former cast members reappeared during the 1989 season in cameo roles, most notably in the &quot;Age&quot; episode, which was hosted by Vanessa Lindores (who was slimed twice during it) and also featured cameos by Doug Ptolemy, Alasdair Gillis, Christine McGlade and Kevin Kubusheskie (who by that time had become a stage producer on the show). Gillis also appeared briefly in the &quot;locker jokes&quot; segment during the &quot;Fantasies&quot; episode, and Adam Reid, who by this time had become an official writer for &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;, also appeared (and was slimed) at the very end of the episode &quot;Punishment.&quot;

The show&#x27;s ratings declined throughout 1989 and 1990. The network&#x27;s desire to produce more of its own shows at its new studios at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, coupled with low ratings, caused production of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; to officially end in 1990 after only five episodes (tying 1990 with 1987 as the shortest season of the series). Though ratings declined, Nickelodeon continued to air reruns until January 1994, at which point it was only aired on weekends.

On October 5, 2015, Nickelodeon&#x27;s sister network TeenNick brought the show back in reruns as the first program on The Splat, its expanded classic-themed block. The airings began with the first two 1981 episodes, &quot;Work&quot; and &quot;Transportation,&quot; marking the first time that those episodes had aired on American television in 30 years. However, only two additional episodes (&quot;Christmas&quot; and &quot;Holidays&quot; from the 1984 season) have been aired since. As of March 23, 2021, the 1981 season has been made available to stream on Paramount+.

===International airings===
&quot;YCDTOTV&quot; was aired in Australia with great success on ABC Television in the mid-1980s, beginning with 1981&#x27;s &quot;Work, Work, Work.&quot; It aired at 5:30 PM on weekdays until August 1987 when the initial run ended. After its first two runs, it was moved to a 7:00 AM weekday morning timeslot in 1989. It continued to run periodically on ABC Television for the next few years, mainly as a filler during the school holidays until the rights expired in the early 1990s. The show was aired in its entirety, including the final two seasons of 1989–90.

The series was also seen in European countries and reportedly in countries in the Middle East (with Arabic dubbing), although no French-dubbed version for distribution in either France or countries in the Francophone world is known to exist. Nor were any local adaptations based on the &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; format known to have been made.

&quot;YCDTOTV&quot; was also broadcast in several other countries, such as the United Kingdom (on the former satellite and cable children&#x27;s network The Children&#x27;s Channel), New Zealand (on TV3), Germany (on Armed Forces Network with the original English audio), Saudi Arabia (on the country&#x27;s former English-language channel Saudi 2) and the Philippines (on RPN-9).

=== Parody ===

&quot;YCDTOTV&quot; has been occasionally referenced during episodes of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, including some of the show&#x27;s trademark gags, such as locker jokes, Barth&#x27;s Burgery and green slime.

In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High&quot;, Peter Griffin is slimed after saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know&#x27;&quot;. It was followed immediately by a still shot that is a direct reference to &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;&#x27;s opening sequence, with the words &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; written in red over a man&#x27;s face. A later episode of the series was titled &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television, Peter&quot;, but contained no overt references to &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;.

In the &quot;NewsRadio&quot; episode &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, Mr. James celebrates April Fools&#x27; Day (in February) by having Joe install the &quot;trigger machines&quot; from &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;, and then tricks the cast into getting slimed and doused with water.

The &quot;1981&quot; episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the &#x27;80s 3-D&quot; features a segment on &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; that features Hal Sparks, Alyson Hannigan and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic all getting slimed after being tricked into saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Wil Wheaton is also slimed during the opening credits.

&quot;YCDTOTV&quot; is also loosely parodied in the 2010 &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;Glitter&quot;, with Cobie Smulders&#x27; character on the Canadian television show &quot;Space Teens&quot; making several references to the show. In reality, Smulders grew up a fan of the show.

The &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; season 47 episode hosted by John Mulaney features a humorous account of how green slime came to be introduced to &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; and ultimately Nickelodeon.

=== Reunion ===
In July 2004, to celebrate the program&#x27;s 25th anniversary, a reunion special called &quot;Project 131&quot; with the theme &quot;Changes&quot; was produced at CJOH-TV starring five members of the original cast. These included Brodie Osome, Marjorie Silcoff, and Vanessa Lindores (visibly pregnant at the time), Justin Cammy and Alasdair Gillis. It was directed by David Dillehunt.

=== Proposed reboot ===
In August 2017, it was announced that &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; would be getting a reboot. Original creator Roger Price would serve as executive producer, while Jimmy Fox of Main Event Media would develop the project. However, Fox stated on their Twitter account on September 14, 2019, that the reboot had been called off.

== Trademarks ==
The show&#x27;s comedy centered around how kids are treated by adults and the rest of the world. The show&#x27;s skits gave satirical and exaggerated views of grown-ups as clueless, out of touch, and often using their status as adults to take advantage of kids. Les Lye portrayed several characters in the recurring skits, including &quot;Ross&quot;, the technical producer and director of the show who constantly cheated and swindled money from everyone, especially the kid actors; &quot;Barth&quot;, a cook at the fast-food burger place who cooked terrible food for the kids; and the father Lance Prevert, who tried to raise his kids but was utterly clueless about what his kids were doing. The younger characters, meanwhile, differed from other kids&#x27; TV shows in the way they often bickered and insulted one another (in their character roles), rather than getting along and enjoying their time together as seen on most other shows for children. Hosts Christine and Alanis frequently insulted each other and each tried to outdo the other in their roles, reflecting the real-life rivalries and competition taking place among kids in everyday life.

Episodes of &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; included recurring gimmicks and gags. The following is a partial list.

=== Opening animation: the Children&#x27;s Television Sausage Factory ===
Originally created by Rand MacIvor (under art director John C. Galt), who was inspired by Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;gilliamations,&quot; the opening animation sequence was a sequence of surreal images set to Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell Overture&quot; performed in a Dixieland jazz arrangement by the National Press Club and Allied Workers Jazz Band. Though the arrangement of the theme music stayed the same throughout the entire series run (although there are subtle differences between the themes in various seasons – especially the closing themes – and &quot;Whatever Turns You On&quot; used a completely different theme song), the opening animation itself changed in different ways.
* The Centre Block of the Canadian Parliament complex was used in the first season and in the original hour-long versions of the 1981 season episodes. In this animation sequence, a person pulls the roof off one side of the building, releasing three balloons bearing the likenesses of the three party leaders at the time: Pierre Trudeau (Liberal), Joe Clark (Progressive Conservative) and Ed Broadbent (NDP). A hand from off-screen then ignites the bottom of the Peace Tower with a match and it launches like a rocket. The start of the animation features a likeness of 1979 cast member David Helpin.
* There are two versions of the &quot;Children&#x27;s Television Sausage Factory&quot; animation. In this sequence, children are &quot;processed&quot; in the &quot;sausage factory&quot; and deposited onto a school bus at the bottom of the factory that transports them to the TV studio (a likeness of the CJOH studios on Merivale Road in Nepean, Ontario). The first version was created for the half-hour, internationally syndicated versions of the 1981 episodes. The second version, which featured larger images and cleaner (albeit less fluid) scene animation than the first version, was introduced in the 1982 season and was used for both the U.S. and Canadian broadcasts of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; until the end of the show in 1990.
* Both versions of the &quot;Children&#x27;s Television Sausage Factory&quot; animation feature likenesses of Jonothan Gebert, Kevin Somers, Marc Baillon and Christine McGlade exiting the school bus, as well as a likeness of Les Lye as the security guard at the door of the TV studio. This footage was reused from the opening sequence of 1979&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Whatever Turns You On&quot;.
* The ending of the introduction shows Lye&#x27;s face with his mouth opening, and his face is stamped &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television.&quot; The screen is then cracked and splits, and the show begins.

=== Preempted show Intro ===
Starting in season two before the intro, there was usually a title card with a gag show that was &quot;preempted&quot; with the announcer Les Lye introducing it (ex: &quot;Mr. T Thinks He&#x27;s A Girl will not be seen today, so that we may present a show still trying to find itself.&quot;—Episode: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;). A lot of 1980s cultural references were used at the time (The A-Team, General Hospital, Rambo, Mister Rogers Neighborhood etc.). Sometimes, the show &quot;itself&quot; was preempted (which happened three times). On the episode &quot;Failure&quot;, they &quot;failed&quot; to come up with an intro. Another episode, titled &quot;Inequalities,&quot; began with a disclaimer that read, &quot;The following program contains certain scenes which may not be suitable for mature audiences, Juvenile discretion is advised&quot; in lieu of a &quot;pre-empted&quot; show.

=== Opposites ===
Each episode had an &quot;opposites&quot; segment (&quot;Opposite Skits, where the opposite of real life really happens&quot;), introduced by a visual effect of the screen flipping upside down, shifting left to fade to the next sketch, and then righting itself. Typically, right before this happened, one or more cast members would be interrupted by another cast member saying the opposite of what the monologue (or dialogue) was about, at which the cast would say, &quot;It must be the introduction to the opposites&quot;, and then the inversion fade would happen. The sketches that followed were a tongue-in-cheek reversal of the show&#x27;s subject and of daily life, often featuring children having authority over adults or adults encouraging children to behave badly (for example, eating sweets instead of vegetables or wasting money on something frivolous rather than putting the money in the bank).

Some &quot;opposites&quot; features were reversals of the roles and gags related to the show&#x27;s recurring characters (usually played by Les Lye or Abby Hagyard), such as the cast getting to execute El Captaino at the firing squad or torturing Nasti the dungeon keeper. Inverse tropes related to Mr. Schitdler in the classroom and the principal in detention were also frequent; however, very rarely would an opposite feature the kids getting their revenge on Barth.

A return to the show&#x27;s daily subject was indicated by another inversion fade, sometimes accompanied by one of the cast members saying, &quot;back to reality.&quot; These would occasionally occur in the middle of a sketch, resulting in the characters inverting whatever they were doing prior to the conclusion of the sketch.

Opposite sketches were used in the inaugural season of the show (the first one, in Episode 2, was submitted by a viewer), but it was not until &quot;Whatever Turns You On&quot; that they became an integral part of the show.

=== Firing squad ===
Most episodes, starting in 1981, included one or more firing-squad sketches in which Lye played El Capitano, a Latin American military officer preparing to order a firing squad (whom he addressed as &quot;the amigos&quot;) to execute one of the child actors tied up standing in front of a firing post. The kid would often trick El Capitano into being shot by the firing squad himself, and, as he keeled over, El Capitano would groan &quot;That is one sneaky keed.&quot;

===Barth&#x27;s Burgers===
Starting with the 1981 season, most episodes featured sketches with the kids eating at Barth&#x27;s Burgery, a fast-food burger restaurant run by Barth (Lye), a chain-smoking, unpleasant, disgusting cook who uses unsanitary and questionable methods of cooking burgers. Most of the sketches involve Barth revealing the contents of the burgers to the kids&#x27; disgust and them remarking &quot;Who(or What) do you think is in the burgers&quot;. Barth&#x27;s trademark is &quot;Duh, I heard that!&quot; or on one episode &quot;Duh, I heard thee.&quot;.

In the 1981 and 1982 seasons, Barth had a worker, Zilch (played by Darryll Lucas), whom he frequently insulted and abused, often by hitting him with a pan and knocking him out cold.

=== Locker jokes ===
During the &quot;locker jokes&quot; segment of each episode, cast members, standing inside school lockers with the words &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; painted on them, told jokes to each other. The person telling the joke would open his or her locker and call another cast member, to whom he or she would tell the joke. For the duration of the joke, those cast members would be the only ones seen with open lockers. After each joke, the actors would close their lockers, allowing the process to start again with different people and a new joke. This was similar to the &quot;joke wall&quot; segment on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In.&quot; The &quot;locker jokes&quot; feature was introduced in the first season and continued until the end of the series. The lockers underwent minor makeovers during the show&#x27;s early years, but mostly remained the same for the entire run of the show. In 2004, when fans and cast reunited for the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the original lockers were auctioned.

=== Production bumper ===
Used in a few episodes in the first two seasons and by almost every episode in later seasons, the closing credits of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; are followed by an announcement of the &quot;company&quot; that produced the program, with the name generally tying in with the episode&#x27;s main subject. These announcements are given in the form of &quot;&#x27;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&#x27; is a ______ production.&quot; Examples of the fictional production company include &quot;Black Eye&quot; (&quot;Bullying&quot;), &quot;Can&#x27;t Give It Away&quot; (&quot;Marketing&quot;), &quot;Split Down the Middle&quot; (&quot;Divorce&quot;), &quot;Hang Out to Dry&quot; (&quot;Malls&quot;) and &quot;Blood Is Thicker Than Water&quot; (&quot;Families&quot;). The production company&#x27;s name was announced by Lye, who often included a joke about the show or its producers only to realize that the cameras were still rolling.

=== Post-credit scene ===
The post-credit production bumper was generally followed by one final sketch, also borrowing a concept from &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, in which the jokes continued for a time after the credits finished rolling. The bumper frequently took place &quot;backstage&quot; and broke the fourth wall with remarks about the episode, usually featuring one final humiliation or comeuppance for that episode&#x27;s main cast member. These scenes were often cut short or removed altogether, especially for airings on Nickelodeon.

=== Other ===
Other signature recurring bits on the show include:
* Fake commercials: Parodies of television commercials were part of the series as early as the first season and were the subject of one full episode in 1986, but the 1982 episodes contained commercial parodies that aired between the commercial bumpers where real commercials ordinarily fit. The products featured ranged from parodies of actual products (such as the Lotachi Lugman, a parody of the Sony Walkman) to completely fictional products (such as a fragrance called &quot;Crème de Peanut&quot;). These fake commercials were cut when Nickelodeon became advertiser-supported in 1983, although some were preserved for later &quot;Worst of YCDTOTV&quot; compilations.
* Blip&#x27;s Arcade: Blip, owner of the local video arcade, would find inventive and devious ways to cheat his customers, such as rigging unwinnable video games or running &quot;specials&quot; in which, he would exchange only three quarters for a dollar.
* Nasti&#x27;s Dungeon: A kid (most often either Kevin Kubusheskie, Alasdair Gillis, Adam Reid or Doug Ptolemy; occasionally Lisa Ruddy, Eugene Contreras, Vanessa Lindores or Adam Klabfleisch) shackled in a dungeon for unknown reasons would be approached by prison warden Nasti, who would make the prisoner falsely believe that he was to be set free. Rarely, a prisoner could convince Nasti to free him or trick Nasti into exchanging places.
* Benedict Arnold School: Strict Mr. Schidtler wages an eternal war with his unruly, ill-prepared students. The school sketches include those in which Mr. Schidtler prevails by embarrassing or punishing students and those in which the students trick him into looking foolish or dismissing class early.
* Detention: Kids are sent to detention by the principal about what they did and one kid is hanging in shackles like he was in a dungeon. The detention is like a part dungeon and part classroom run by the principal. 
* Various interiors of the Prevert home, including the front steps as Mom prepares to send the kids off to school.
* A bunk bed at summer camp where the kids discuss how uncomfortable and sadistic the camp activities are.
* A doctor&#x27;s office, dentist&#x27;s office and principal&#x27;s office, all similarly evil or mischievous.
* There were also in-person interviews, during which Christine McGlade interviewed ordinary children about the show&#x27;s topic and asked them about their opinions. The segment ran from 1981 until McGlade left the show in 1986.

== Water, slime and pies ==
Affectionately called &quot;stage pollution&quot; by the cast and crew, certain keywords resulted in cast members having unpleasant substances poured onto them from above, or thrown at them from off camera.

=== Water ===
When someone said the word &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;, a large amount of cold water would fall onto them from above. In the earlier years of the show, cast members (especially Christine) were doused pails of water, but starting in 1981, the water would fall from above. By the 1984 season, only the word &quot;water&quot; led to a dousing, whereas in earlier seasons, the words &quot;wet&quot; and &quot;H2O&quot; also did. On occasion, cast members tried to dodge the water by saying &quot;agua&quot; (Spanish), &quot;Wasser&quot; (German) or &quot;eau&quot; (French) instead, only to be soaked anyway. In one episode, characters rehearse a sketch in a made-up foreign language; one of the made-up words is &quot;pingle-ding&quot; which apparently means &quot;water&quot;, as the kid who says &quot;pingle-ding&quot; gets drenched (twice).

While the show&#x27;s green slime changed ingredients and even consistencies, frequently, the water was almost always the same. Occasionally, cast members were doused with variations such as soapy, hot, brown, toilet, or yellow polluted water.

=== Slime ===
When someone said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; green slime would pour down on them from above. This type of prank was known as being &quot;slimed,&quot; and it became one of the show&#x27;s most notable elements. As with waterings, the sliming gag was used in almost every episode, especially from 1982 onward. According to writer-director Geoffrey Darby, the slime gave the kids a &quot;comeuppance&quot;, so that they wouldn&#x27;t appear arrogant.

Green slime was a fixture of the series from the very beginning, appearing in the show&#x27;s first episode. In the book &quot;Slimed! An Oral History of Nickelodeon&#x27;s Golden Age&quot;, Darby stated that the original slime developed &quot;by accident&quot;; Darby had originally planned for a bucket of food leftovers from the CJOH cafeteria, with water added, to be dumped on Tim, but the production of that first episode was delayed by a week. When the time came to shoot the scene, the contents of the bucket had turned green with mold. Darby authorized the mixture to be dumped on Tim anyway. Roger Price was furious, but the response from the viewing audience was positive, so Darby and Price wrote an entire 1979 show about the slime (&quot;The Green Slime Show&quot;) in which Lisa Ruddy is the victim of six slimings (a &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; record). With that episode, the use of &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; as the slime&#x27;s trigger phrase was introduced, and it quickly became the show&#x27;s trademark gag.

Most of the cast did not like getting slimed (Christine McGlade said it was &quot;gross and challenging&quot;), and on occasion, they tried to avoid saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; This usually backfired, as in the &quot;Computers&quot; episode when McGlade said &quot;insufficient data&quot; instead of &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; and got green slime dumped on her anyway, since, as it was explained by Lisa Ruddy who was with McGlade at the time, the slime for that episode was computer-controlled. Some variations of the magic words also triggered the slime, such as in the &quot;Blame&quot; episode when the entire cast got slimed together after one of them said, &quot;we don&#x27;t know.&quot;

Although the slime was usually green, other colors, such as red, blue, yellow and even black and white, were occasionally used. 1981&#x27;s &quot;Safety First&quot; episode, which featured white slime as part of a recurring joke in about &quot;wearing white at night,&quot; was the first episode known to have used a slime color other than green. Lisa got slimed with white slime after saying &quot;I really don&#x27;t know&quot;. In the 1982 episode &quot;Television,&quot; Christine is slimed in green, red, blue, yellow and &quot;stripes&quot; (green, red, blue and yellow at once) while trying to explain about green slime to newcomer Vanessa Lindores. (McGlade had the slime washed out by mentioning to Vanessa that it usually comes out with water, and then got dumped on with water.) This sketch was later seen in the opening to the 1987 thriller film &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;. In one of the show&#x27;s crueler pranks, Ross (Les Lye) tricks Christine into getting dumped with a thicker, chunkier blue slime. The 1986 &quot;Enemies and Paranoia&quot; episode used the word &quot;freedom&quot; as a trigger phrase for red slime after the studio was taken over by Russian communists. Other instances of slime colors other than green include orange slime in the &quot;Myths&quot; episode, brown slime in the &quot;Cosmetics&quot; episode and black slime in the &quot;Time&quot; episode.

The recipe for green slime originally consisted of rotten food. However, after continued complaints from the cast about the hazardous ingredients, the recipe was changed to a mixture of lime-green gelatin powder, oatmeal and water. Eventually baby shampoo was added so that it the slime would wash out of the actors&#x27; hair more easily after several of the female cast members complained. In the &quot;Television&quot; episode, Christine reveals the ingredients as water, gelatin powder, flour and soap. In later years, the recipe consisted simply of green food coloring and cottage cheese, though it spoiled if left too long under hot studio lights.

Especially in the later years of the show, cast members who were slimed frequently looked upward into the slime as it was falling so that it covered their faces (the same was also true of the waterings). To avoid damage to the set from water or slime, a clear tarpaulin was laid on the floor, which can occasionally be seen and/or heard underneath the actors, and the loud splatter sound usually heard during a watering or sliming is that of the liquid hitting the tarpaulin. Actors to be slimed or soaked usually appeared barefoot in the scene, and several cast members who were slimed were reportedly paid extra. Scenes involving slimings were the final ones taped during a recording, allowing the actors to immediately rinse after the scene without causing delays.

Green slime grew to become a trademark image for Nickelodeon, and the network demanded more slimings on the show as the years went on, resulting in episodes such as 1985&#x27;s &quot;Movies&quot; in which the entire cast (save for Abby Hagyard) is slimed. Nickelodeon later introduced green slime shampoo, which was a frequent parting gift on its game show &quot;Double Dare&quot;, on which slime was heavily used. Mattel sold Nickelodeon slime and the Gak brand in the 1990s. Slime was also frequently used in the network&#x27;s advertisements featuring &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; cast members as victims of an impromptu sliming. Nickelodeon&#x27;s former studios in Orlando had a green slime geyser. The network continues to use green slime during its annual Kids&#x27; Choice Awards and coverage of the National Football League.

=== Pies ===
The original slapstick pie-in-the-face gag was also frequently used on &quot;YCDTOTV&quot;, although pie scenes were most common during the early years of the show. One whole episode, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Drugs&quot;, was constructed completely around the pie-in-the-face gag. To avoid the wrath of the censors, the episode showed the cast getting &quot;high&quot; by pieing themselves continuously, comparing the stupidity of hitting oneself with a pie to that of taking drugs. Unlike the slime and water, pies were not usually triggered by any certain word or trigger phrase, although in the earlier years, saying &quot;let me have it&quot; or &quot;give it to me&quot; would frequently result in a pieing.

== Cast ==

Apart from the central cast as Les Lye and Abby Hagyard, who played the adult character roles, over 100 pre-teen and teenage actors appeared on &quot;YCDTOTV&quot; between 1979 and 1990. Some of the most notable cast members included:

<text>Mixmaster is a Type II anonymous remailer which sends messages in fixed-size packets and reorders them, preventing anyone watching the messages go in and out of remailers from tracing them. It is an implementation of a David Chaum&#x27;s mix network.

== History ==
Mixmaster was originally written by Lance Cottrell, and was maintained by Len Sassaman. Peter Palfrader is the current maintainer. Current Mixmaster software can be compiled to handle Cypherpunk messages as well; they are needed as reply blocks for nym servers.

Support for Mixmaster was removed from the Neomutt fork of the Mutt mail client in 2024 because the project did not seem active anymore.

<text>An anonymous remailer is a server that receives messages with embedded instructions on where to send them next, and that forwards them without revealing where they originally came from. There are cypherpunk anonymous remailers, mixmaster anonymous remailers, and nym servers, among others, which differ in how they work, in the policies they adopt, and in the type of attack on the anonymity of e-mail they can (or are intended to) resist. &quot;Remailing&quot; as discussed in this article applies to e-mails intended for particular recipients, not the general public. Anonymity in the latter case is more easily addressed by using any of several methods of anonymous publication.

==Types of remailer==
There are several strategies that affect the anonymity of the handled e-mail. In general, different classes of anonymous remailers differ with regard to the choices their designers/operators have made. These choices can be influenced by the legal ramifications of operating specific types of remailers.

It must be understood that every data packet traveling on the Internet contains the node addresses (as raw IP bit strings) of both the sending and intended recipient nodes, and so no data packet can &quot;ever&quot; actually be anonymous at this level . In addition, all standards-based e-mail messages contain defined fields in their headers in which the source and transmitting entities (and Internet nodes as well) are required to be included.

Some remailers change both types of address in messages they forward, and the list of forwarding nodes in e-mail messages as well, as the message passes through; in effect, they substitute &#x27;fake source addresses&#x27; for the originals. The &#x27;IP source address&#x27; for that packet may become that of the remailer server itself, and within an e-mail message (which is usually several packets), a nominal &#x27;user&#x27; on that server. Some remailers forward their anonymized e-mail to still other remailers, and only after several such hops is the e-mail actually delivered to the intended address.

There are, more or less, four types of remailers:

===Pseudonymous remailers===
A pseudonymous remailer simply takes away the e-mail address of the sender, gives a pseudonym to the sender, and sends the message to the intended recipient (that can be answered via that remailer).

===Cypherpunk remailers, also called Type I===
A Cypherpunk remailer sends the message to the recipient, stripping away the sender address on it. One can not answer a message sent via a Cypherpunk remailer. The message sent to the remailer can usually be encrypted, and the remailer will decrypt it and send it to the recipient address hidden inside the encrypted message. In addition, it is possible to chain two or three remailers, so that each remailer can&#x27;t know who is sending a message to whom. Cypherpunk remailers do not keep logs of transactions.

===Mixmaster remailers, also called Type II===
In Mixmaster, the user composes an email to a remailer, which is relayed through each node in the network using SMTP, until it finally arrives at the final recipient. Mixmaster can only send emails one way. An email is sent anonymously to an individual, but for them to be able to respond, a reply address must be included in the body of the email. Also, Mixmaster remailers require the use of a computer program to write messages. Such programs are not supplied as a standard part of most operating systems or mail management systems.

===Mixminion remailers, also called Type III===
A Mixminion remailer attempts to address the following challenges in Mixmaster remailers: replies, forward anonymity, replay prevention and key rotation, exit policies, integrated directory servers and dummy traffic. They are currently available for the Linux and Windows platforms. Some implementations are open source.

==Traceable remailers==

Some remailers establish an internal list of actual senders and invented names such that a recipient can send mail to &quot;invented name&quot; AT &quot;some-remailer.example&quot;. When receiving traffic addressed to this user, the server software consults that list, and forwards the mail to the original sender, thus permitting anonymous—though traceable with access to the list—two-way communication. The famous &quot;penet.fi&quot; remailer in Finland did just that for several years. Because of the existence of such lists in this type of remailing server, it is possible to break the anonymity by gaining access to the list(s), by breaking into the computer, asking a court (or merely the police in some places) to order that the anonymity be broken, and/or bribing an attendant. This happened to penet.fi as a result of some traffic passed through it about Scientology. The Church claimed copyright infringement and sued penet.fi&#x27;s operator. A court ordered the list be made available. Penet&#x27;s operator shut it down after destroying its records (including the list) to retain identity confidentiality for its users; though not before being forced to supply the court with the real e-mail addresses of two of its users.

More recent remailer designs use cryptography in an attempt to provide more or less the same service, but without so much risk of loss of user confidentiality. These are generally termed nym servers or pseudonymous remailers. The degree to which they remain vulnerable to forced disclosure (by courts or police) is and will remain unclear since new statutes/regulations and new cryptanalytic developments proceed apace. Multiple anonymous forwarding among cooperating remailers in different jurisdictions may retain, but cannot guarantee, anonymity against a determined attempt by one or more governments, or civil litigators.

==Untraceable remailers==
If users accept the loss of two-way interaction, identity anonymity can be made more secure.

By not keeping any list of users and corresponding anonymizing labels for them, a remailer can ensure that any message that has been forwarded leaves no internal information behind that can later be used to break identity confidentiality. However, while being handled, messages remain vulnerable within the server (e.g., to Trojan software in a compromised server, to a compromised server operator, or to mis-administration of the server), and traffic analysis comparison of traffic into and out of such a server can suggest quite a lot—far more than almost any would credit.

The Mixmaster strategy is designed to defeat such attacks, or at least to increase their cost (i.e., to &#x27;attackers&#x27;) beyond feasibility. If every message is passed through several servers (ideally in different legal and political jurisdictions), then attacks based on legal systems become considerably more difficult, if only because of &#x27;Clausewitzian&#x27; friction among lawyers, courts, different statutes, organizational rivalries, legal systems, etc. And, since many different servers and server operators are involved, subversion of any (i.e., of either system or operator) becomes less effective also since no one (most likely) will be able to subvert the entire chain of remailers.

Random padding of messages, random delays before forwarding, and encryption of forwarding information between forwarding remailers, increases the degree of difficulty for attackers still further as message size and timing can be largely eliminated as traffic analysis clues, and lack of easily readable forwarding information renders ineffective simple automated traffic analysis algorithms.

==Web-based mailer==
There are also web services that allow users to send anonymous email messages. These services do not provide the anonymity of real remailers, but they are easier to use. When using a web-based anonymous email or anonymous remailer service, its reputation should first be analyzed, since the service stands between senders and recipients. Some of the aforementioned web services log the users IP addresses to ensure they do not break the law; others offer superior anonymity with attachment functionality by choosing to trust that the users will not breach the websites terms of service (ToS).

==Remailer statistics==

In most cases, remailers are owned and operated by individuals, and are not as stable as they might ideally be. In fact, remailers can, and have, gone down without warning. It is important to use up-to-date statistics when choosing remailers.

==Remailer abuse and blocking by governments ==

Although most re-mailer systems are used responsibly, the anonymity they provide can be exploited by entities or individuals whose reasons for anonymity are not necessarily benign.

Such reasons could include support for violent extremist actions, sexual exploitation of children or more commonly to frustrate accountability for &#x27;trolling&#x27; and harassment of targeted individuals, or companies (The Dizum.com re-mailer chain being abused as recently as May 2013 for this purpose.)

The response of some re-mailers to this abuse potential is often to disclaim responsibility (as dizum.com does), as owing to the technical design (and ethical principles) of many systems, it is impossible for the operators to physically unmask those using their systems. Some re-mailer systems go further and claim that it would be illegal for them to monitor for certain types abuse at all.

Until technical changes were made in the remailers concerned in the mid-2000s, some re-mailers (notably nym.alias.net based systems) were seemingly willing to use any genuine (and thus valid) but otherwise forged address. This loophole allowed trolls to mis-attribute controversial claims or statements with the aim of causing offence, upset or harassment to the genuine holder(s) of the address(es) forged.

While re-mailers may disclaim responsibility, the comments posted via them have led to them being blocked in some countries. In 2014, dizum.com (a Netherlands-based remailer) was seemingly blocked by authorities in Pakistan, because comments an (anonymous) user of that service had made concerning key figures in Islam.

<text>Year 97 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Lentulus and Crassus (or, less frequently, year 657 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;) and the Fourth Year of Tianhan. The denomination 97 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* Consuls: Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus and Publius Licinius Crassus.
* C. Decianus, the prosecutor of Furius, is himself condemned for his remarks about the death of Saturninus.
* The Romans subdue the Maedi and Dardani.
* L. Domitius takes harsh measures to restore order in Sicily.
* The censors, Flaccus and Antonius, remove M. Duronius from the senate because of his opposition to sumptuary laws.
* A decree of the Roman Senate bans human sacrifices.
* Sulla displays a lion hunt for the first time in games at Rome.

==== Asia Minor ====
* Ariarathes VIII is forced out of Cappadocia by Mithridates, and dies soon afterwards.

==== China ====
* The Han generals Li Guangli, Gongsun Ao, Han Yue and Lu Bode lead armies into Xiongnu territory. The campaign achieves little, and Gongsun Ao suffers a defeat. Emperor Wu of Han condemns him to death due to his troops suffering heavy losses, but he escapes by feigning his death. He is eventually discovered and executed during the witchcraft trials of 91 BC.

==== Japan ====
* Sujin becomes emperor of Japan (approximate date).

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* Joseph, the husband of Mary the mother of Jesus, and his &quot;earthly-father&quot; - in distinction to God the Father, his &quot;heavenly father&quot; - is born. According to some accounts, Joseph was 92 years old when Jesus was born.

<text>Desperate Dan is a wild west character in the now-defunct Scottish comic magazine &quot;The Dandy&quot;. He made his appearance in the first issue which was dated 4 December 1937 and became the magazine&#x27;s mascot. He is apparently the world&#x27;s strongest man, able to lift a cow with one hand. The pillow of his (reinforced) bed is filled with building rubble and his beard is so tough he shaves with a blowtorch.

The character was created by Dudley D. Watkins, originally as an outlaw or ‘desperado’ (hence his name), but evolved into a more sympathetic type, using his strength to help the underdog. After Watkins’ death in 1969, the cartoons were drawn by many other artists, principally Ken H. Harrison, though the Watkins canon was often recycled. When the Dandy became digital-only in 2012, the Desperate Dan strips were drawn by David Parkins.

There is a statue of Dan in Dundee, Scotland, where his publishers, D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. are based.

==History==

The strip was drawn by Dudley D. Watkins until his death in 1969. Although &quot;The Dandy Annual&quot;s featured new strips from other artists from then on, the comic continued reprinting Watkins strips until 1983 (though the then Korky the Cat artist Charles Grigg drew new strips for annuals and summer specials), when it was decided to start running new strips. These were initially drawn by Peter Davidson, but Ken H. Harrison soon took over as regular artist. The following year Dan was promoted to the front cover of &quot;The Dandy&quot;, replacing Korky who had been there since issue 1. Starting from issue 2985, dated 6 February 1999, Cuddles and Dimples replaced Dan on the front cover. This did not last long, however, as after a readers&#x27; poll in 2000, Dan returned to the cover. Although Ken Harrison was the main artist from 1983 to 2007, other artists have also occasionally filled in for Harrison, including Tom Williams, David Parkins, Trevor Metcalfe and Anthony Caluori in the early 1990s. John Geering took over the strip between 1994 and 1997, after which Harrison returned as full-time artist (though Steve Bright occasionally acted as a ghost artist as well). When &quot;The Dandy&quot; was redesigned and renamed &quot;Dandy Xtreme&quot;, the writers used reprints of the old comic strips, until Jamie Smart took over drawing and writing the Desperate Dan comic strips in April 2008.

Desperate Dan&#x27;s final appearance left his fate ambiguous after being caught in an oil well explosion.

==Characteristics==
Desperate Dan&#x27;s favourite food is cow pie – a type of enormous meat pie with the horns sticking out, although the term &quot;cow pie&quot; has a different meaning in the American West. Much like Popeye with his spinach, Desperate Dan draws his immense power from eating these pies. Desperate Dan was voted the UK&#x27;s second favourite superhero after Batman in 2011.

Initially Dan was a desperado on the wrong side of the law, hence the name &quot;Desperate&quot; Dan. Later on, however, he switched sides and become a friendlier character, helping the underdog, although sometimes his great strength caused more harm than good. The first member of his family to appear in the strip was Aunt Aggie (issue 107, dated 16 December 1939) followed by his nephew, Danny (issue 304, dated 27 October 1945) and niece, Katey in 1957. In 2001, Desperate Dan&#x27;s girlfriend Little Bear, an Indian squaw, was introduced, but she disappeared with the 2004 &quot;Dandy&quot; relaunch, when Dan&#x27;s artwork style changed.

==Modernisation==
With the first revamp of &quot;The Dandy&quot; (from issue 3282, 16 October 2004) Dan, though still drawn by Ken Harrison, was redesigned slightly. His eyes and chin became much bigger and exaggerated. Dan&#x27;s personality was changed to that of a bumbling fool, a change to which many fans objected. He was originally going to be left out of the revamped issues, but focus group tests objected to his absence.

But, as of the &quot;re-revamp&quot; in August 2007, the strips became classic reprints on the back cover of Dandy Comix in &quot;The Dandy Xtreme&quot;. While the first few issues ran them in the original monochrome, they have since been run in coloured form, all reprints were adopted from the 1997 &quot;Legend of Desperate Dan&quot; book which was released to celebrate his 60th anniversary. For the &quot;MegaComix Special&quot; in February 2008, there were two Desperate Dan strips. One was the usual Dudley Watkins reprint, the other was a brand new one by Jamie Smart, who later became Dan&#x27;s artist and writer for 12 issues in April 2008. The MegaComix Special also featured a guide to drawing, by Jamie Smart, which showed how he drew the Desperate Dan strip (which was over the page). This didn&#x27;t actually feature, nor did the comic strip, inside the Comix pullout.

Later, in early April 2008, Jamie Smart took over writing and illustrating the Desperate Dan comic strips and changed Dan&#x27;s personality into a big hearted dope who was constantly getting into trouble because of his fantastic strength. Zeke&#x27;s personality was also changed into a person who loved &#x27;re-refried beans&#x27;. Danny and Katey also disappeared.

A number of spin-off strips have appeared in &quot;The Dandy&quot; over the years, including Desperate Dawg in the 1970s and 80s, Danny and Katey in the late 1980s and Aunt Aggie in the 2000s (before the 2004 relaunch). A statue of him (and his dog Dawg) can be found in the High Street of Dundee, Scotland – &quot;The Dandy&quot; is published by Dundee-based D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. According to the writer Norman Watson, the Desperate Dan statue (erected as part of the Dundee Public Art Programme) is the most photographed of 120 pieces of public art in the city.

==Digital Dandy==
After the print &quot;Dandy&quot; ended with its 75th anniversary issue (for which Ken H. Harrison returned to draw one final strip, reverting to the art style he had employed during the 1980s and 1990s), &quot;The Dandy&quot; relaunched as a digital comic. David Parkins returned to DC Thomson to draw Desperate Dan with Dan&#x27;s previous artist, Jamie Smart, drawing a relaunch of &quot;The Numskulls&quot; from &quot;The Beezer&quot;.

<text>The Bash Street Kids is a comic strip in the British comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. It also appeared briefly in The Wizard as series of prose stories in 1955. The strip, created by Leo Baxendale as When the Bell Rings!, first appeared in issue 604. It became &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; in 1956 and has become a regular feature, appearing in every issue. From 1962, until his death in 2023, David Sutherland drew over 3000 strips in his time as illustrator.

== History ==
Like many long-running UK comic strips, &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; is mostly frozen in the era when it began. It portrays Class 2B of the Bash Street School in Beanotown, where the teacher and headmaster wear gowns and the pupils sit at wood desks with inkwells. They are taught by a stereotypical &quot;Teacher&quot;, whose wife is &quot;Mrs Teacher&quot;. The characters were inspired by the view from the D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. office windows, overlooking the High School of Dundee playground. According to Leo Baxendale, &quot;In fact, the catalyst for my creation of Bash Street was a Giles cartoon of January 1953: kids pouring out of school, heads flying off and sundry mayhems. Straight away, I pencilled a drawing of &#x27;The Kids of Bash Street School&#x27; and posted it from my home in Preston to R. D. Low, the managing editor of D.C. Thomson&#x27;s children&#x27;s publications in Dundee. I received an offhand response, a dampener. It was only after I&#x27;d created Little Plum (April 1953) and Minnie the Minx (September 1953) that the Beano editor George Moonie travelled to Preston on 20 October 1953 and asked me to go ahead with Bash Street (he gave it the provisional title of &#x27;When The Bell Goes&#x27;; when it appeared in The Beano in February 1954, it was titled &#x27;When The Bell Rings&#x27;).&quot; Over time, the Bash Street School&#x27;s large number of pupils slowly shrank to its trademark ten. When they first appeared, the strips consisted of the kids outside school; the settings were increasingly inside the school, and the strip was retitled &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; on 11 November 1956 with &quot;the kids&quot; preparing for a pantomime.

In 1994 (the Kids&#x27; 40th anniversary), it was announced that &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; would be overhauled to appeal to a more politically correct, modern audience. Changes included the replacement of Danny&#x27;s trademark school hat by a top hat, Fatty becoming fit and muscular and Tom-boy Toots acting more feminine. The school would be replaced by a technologically advanced &quot;academy&quot;, and Teacher by a robot. A protest began, accompanied by petitions and publicity stunts throughout Britain, demanding that the characters remain the same. The proposal turned out to be a hoax when the story introducing the new Bash Street Kids saw them in their old ways. Editor Euan Kerr was pleased with the fan response, saying that the publication &quot;even got death threats!&quot; Shortly afterwards, an animated adaptation was produced as a segment of &quot;The Beano Video Stars&quot;.
By 2000 &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; was a feature-length strip, filling an entire &quot;Beano&quot; book. Often drawn by Mike Pearce and Kev F. Sutherland, during the late 2000s the strips moved to &quot;Beano&quot; sister publication &quot;BeanoMAX&quot; (where they were drawn by Nigel Parkinson). These feature-length strips were more detailed, delving into an obscure character&#x27;s personality and introducing new traits. Spotty was revealed as sarcastic and aggressive, while Plug was a more sympathetic, emotional character. The strips detailed a rivalry between the kids and the comic&#x27;s cover star, Dennis the Menace. Mike Pearce soon began penciling a spin-off from the original strip, &quot;The Bash Street Kids – Singled Out&quot;, a single-page comic concentrating on one &quot;kid&quot; a week. Pearce retired, the strips were taken over by Tom Paterson before being mothballed and they were later collected into two annuals.

As Dennis the Menace was revamped, he appeared less with other &quot;Beano&quot; characters and more by himself due to the popularity of his new TV series. &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; now has three spin-offs: &quot;Simply Smiffy&quot;, &quot;Winston&quot; and &quot;The Bash Street Burp&quot;. In the July 2013 75th-birthday edition of &quot;The Beano&quot;, a lane near Dundee&#x27;s West Marketgait was named Bash Street; whereas an anniversary strip showed Bash Street School being destroyed; the characters relocated to Beano High.

In May 2021, the character &quot;Fatty&quot; was renamed &quot;Freddy&quot;, in an attempt to stop children using the name as an insult for overweight peers. The character &quot;Spotty&quot; was renamed &quot;Scotty&quot; in December 2021.

In June 2021, two new characters, Harsha and Mandi, were introduced to the strip. Harsha already appeared in another strip, Har Har&#x27;s Joke Shop, which is about her family and the joke shop her father Hari &quot;Har Har&quot; Chandra owns. Mandi previously had her own occasional strip that dealt with mental health issues to promote the charity YoungMinds, and as such her main trait is that she worries about things.

In June 2022, three more characters, Stevie, Khadija, and Mahira, were introduced to the strip. All three had their own strips prior to their addition. In addition, Cuthbert was given more of a spotlight from this point onwards, as he only showed up in the strip on different occasions throughout the year.

== Class 2B ==
The strip features Class 2B, which contains fifteen pupils.

=== Danny ===
Daniel Deathshead &quot;Danny&quot; Morgan, was the first identified member of the roguish members of Class 2B, first appearing in the comic strip&#x27;s debut and becoming the leader after he gave each kid a wine gum. Danny often devises the kids&#x27; pranks and escape routes from school. Although he is clever he does poorly in school, primarily due to his laziness and short attention span. Danny is often described as having the &quot;soul of a pirate&quot;, the reason he gets caught up in rebellious schemes and boisterous activities. Like most of the other characters he is usually rude to adults, once asking Smiffy to speak up because he couldn&#x27;t hear him over Teacher. In later strips Danny has some respect for Teacher, often helping him out of trouble. Although he hates school, like the other children he found it hard to cope when the Bash Street School was closed. As the leader Danny is prone to conceit, and in the 2006 &quot;Beano&quot; annual he announces that his conker is indestructible in a competition. His swelled head is often deflated by a fellow student. In the present, Danny usually wears a skull and crossbones jumper and a floppy red school cap.

Danny seems especially close to Toots, calling her his second-in-command, and is most annoyed by Smiffy&#x27;s stupidity and Spotty&#x27;s sarcasm. He occasionally enjoys making fun of Plug&#x27;s looks and Fatty&#x27;s weight. Danny has an intense rivalry with Dennis the Menace, highlighted in a strip where the two compete to find a treasure under The O2 Arena and ending with Danny outwitting Dennis; they often argue in crossover strips. Although Danny also dislikes Roger the Dodger (although he is willing to use him) and Minnie the Minx, their rivalries are not as intense and he once had a crush on Minnie. He is a central character in &quot;The Beano Interactive DVD&quot; with Dennis, Gnasher, Minnie the Minx and Roger the Dodger.

=== &#x27;Erbert ===

Herbert Henry &quot;&#x27;Erbert&quot; Hoover is a short-sighted boy who struggles to see even with his spectacles, first appearing in issue 696. &#x27;Erbert is considered the least-mischievous student, Beano Top Trumps – Erbert is least menacing of all Bash Street Kids and is said to resemble a human mole. Except for Cuthbert, the rest of the class have fun swapping his thick-rimmed glasses with others and seeing the resultant mayhem. In older strips, the character is sometimes called Herbert instead of &#x27;Erbert. His short-sightedness is shared by his parents, who have ended up in different parts of town on many parents&#x27; evenings.

Feature-length strips and crossovers brand most of &#x27;Erbert&#x27;s mischief as accidental or the result of misdirection. During an escape, &#x27;Erbert is usually bumping into a wall or running in the opposite direction. His short-sightedness is renowned; in &quot;The Beano Annual 2000&quot; the characters take a cruise to Perth, only to reach shore at Perth, Scotland. When they go to the captain&#x27;s quarters, they discover that &#x27;Erbert has put himself in charge of the ship.

Although he is quiet and friendly, &#x27;Erbert can wreak as much havoc as his classmates. He is a source of entertainment for the others; Sidney and Spotty once send him into a field full of cow pats, with misleading directions for getting out. Despite this, they consider him &quot;one of the kids&quot;. When he moves to the Bash Street Academy &#x27;Erbert receives contact lenses to improve his sight, discarding them when he returns to his old school.

=== Fatty ===

Frederick Joseph Brown (formerly nicknamed Fatty, now nicknamed Freddy) first appeared in issue 607. He is a large, round boy who is always eating, only in later strips is he ridiculed for his weight; he usually reacts by trying to prove the others wrong, but earlier he is indifferent. When Danny tricks Freddy into completing a long assault course to prove his fitness, he breaks the equipment. Although he is usually the only student able to eat school cook Olive&#x27;s meals without incident, in the 2009 annual her curry makes him ill. Freddy has several stories about him in the Beano Library series. In the academy makeover, he has slimmed down, but regains his former girth after being freed from brainwashing.

Until mid-May 2021, he was nicknamed &quot;Fatty&quot;, but was renamed &quot;Freddy&quot; in an attempt to stop children using the name as an insult for overweight peers.
=== Plug ===

Percival Proudfoot &quot;Plug&quot; Plugsley first appeared in issue 606. He is a lanky, gangling character with a large overbite, protruding ears, two buck teeth and a wide nose. On the cover of &quot;Plug&quot; his name is given as Percival Proudfoot Plugsey, although in some earlier strips he is named Claude. Plug&#x27;s real name is only occasionally used in &quot;The Beano&quot;, such as in &quot;Singled Out&quot; when Teacher addresses him by his full name. He is originally known as Pug; according to &quot;The Beano&quot;, the &quot;l&quot; was added when Smiffy had one to spare after misspelling &quot;silly&quot;.

Despite, or perhaps because of his appearance Plug is one of the more sympathetic Bash Street Kids, often ready to defend those he feels have been unjustly treated; he once calms Danny down after he loses patience with Smiffy&#x27;s stupidity. He has on one occasion fainted from seeing his own reflection (after polishing the handles of Teacher&#x27;s bicycle), and considers himself the most handsome boy in Beanotown.

Plug had his own comic from 1977 to 1979 featuring him and his two pets (Pug from Pup Parade and Chunkee the Monkey), and was the first Beano character with a spin-off. &quot;Plug&quot; was later incorporated into &quot;The Beezer&quot;.

He has two sisters, Plugella and Plugena, who closely resemble him. However, in earlier strips his father was shown to be quite handsome (to the confusion of the other kids) and Plug is described as taking after his mother in appearance. In the September 2014 issue of &quot;The Beano&quot; he is described as Jonah&#x27;s nephew, implying that he is the son of Jonah&#x27;s sister Jinx.

With Kev F. Sutherland, Plug had a more dominant role and was frequently a story&#x27;s main character. In one he has a girlfriend, making him the first Beano character (except for Walter) to do so.

Although Plug received plastic surgery for the Bash Street Academy makeover, he soon returned to his familiar appearance. When he sees his friends brainwashed into behaving, he saves them by installing a virus on the robot teacher&#x27;s disc drive.
=== Toots ===

Toots Pye , whose real name is Sydney Kate Pye, was until May 2021 the only girl in Class 2B. Although she is a tomboy, she does have some feminine interests. One of her biggest interests is football, and has been shown to be better than all of the boys in her class at it, even when she is against all of them. She is also a fan of boy bands and has admitted a crush on Dennis the Menace, sending him a valentine. Although most of the kids dislike Dennis, her friendship with Minnie the Minx is also surprising and she is the only kid to show any warmth to either character.

Surprisingly tough and as bossy as Danny, Toots is the gang&#x27;s second-in-command and takes charge in Danny&#x27;s absence. Her bossiness is exemplified in the feature-length &quot;Queen Toots&quot;, where she discovers she is connected to royalty. When Toots takes advantage of her power, Dennis announces that she cannot boss him around and she puts him in a makeshift prison tower (quickly populated by other &quot;Beano&quot; characters and the rest of the kids). She loves music, often pulling a &quot;boogie box&quot; (a CD player) behind her or listening to her headphones instead of Teacher.

Although Toots enjoys the boys&#x27; company, she sometimes exhibits disdain, naivete or exasperation at their more boyish behaviour. In the academy makeover, she wears a frilly dress and her hair and face are made up.
=== Sidney ===

Sidney Mason Pye is Toots&#x27; younger twin brother by three minutes, first appearing in issue 622. His spiked haircut resembles a chimney-sweeping brush. He is a trickster, with Smiffy a frequent target. When the kids rehearse a nativity play, Smiffy asks what sound a sheep makes. Sidney replies &quot;Woof&quot;, and he and Wilfred go into hysterics when Smiffy ruins the rehearsal. He makes pithy remarks about the other kids, to the amusement of those around him; he and Spotty fight several times when the latter is a target.

Sidney loves animals and has a wide variety of pets, from elephants to mice. His mouse is often part of the kids&#x27; plans. During the academy makeover, his chimney-brush hair is shaved off and he is apparently hypnotised.
=== Smiffy ===

Aristotle John Smiffy first appeared in issue 613, and is portrayed as a jovial scatterbrain. When Teacher calls the roll, instead of saying &quot;Present, sir&quot; he says &quot;Gift, miss&quot;. Although he is sometimes very kind and intuitive (similar to an &quot;idiot savant&quot;), most of the time he cannot remember what colour the sky is. In his brief involvement in &quot;The Wizard&quot;, he is given the name John Smith. Smiffy has appeared in two spin-off strips: the 1971–72 &quot;Says Smiffy&quot; and the 1985–87 &quot;Simply Smiffy&quot; (where he appears with his brother, Normal Norman). In 2008 he acquires a pet pebble, Kevin, who has his own feature (&quot;Where&#x27;s Kevin?&quot;) in &quot;The Beano&quot; number 3604. First appearing in a 2008 &quot;Singled Out&quot; story, Kevin appears in &quot;Bash Street Kids&quot; stories in 2010 and 2011. In the academy makeover Smiffy has a new brain installed, making him the brightest of the kids.

===Scotty (&quot;Spotty&quot;)===

James Scott Cameron (formerly nicknamed Spotty, now nicknamed Scotty) is a short boy who wears a blue collared jersey and an extremely long, striped tie. He is proud and protective of the 976 black spots covering his face, fending off any attempts to remove them. Teacher sees him as the mouthiest of the kids; in &quot;Singled Out&quot; and feature-length strips, he interrupts the lessons with comments. Scotty is sarcastic, conceited and protective about his masculinity and height. Like Danny he dislikes Dennis the Menace, especially after Dennis menaces him during the latter&#x27;s 50th-birthday party. In the academy makeover, Scotty&#x27;s spots and aggressive, sarcastic nature are gone. In late 2021 Scotty declared that he was tired of being defined solely by his spots, leading the other kids to help him choose the new nickname Scotty, taken from his middle name Scott.
=== Wilfrid ===

Wilfrid John Wimble is the smallest and quietest of the Bash Street Kids, and has social anxiety, his thoughts hidden behind a green jumper going up to his nose. He loves turtles, and resembles a tortoise; his neck is never seen, because when he removes his jumper his vest is just as high.

He is often simply present in the stories, speaking only occasionally. Unlike &#x27;Erbert, most of Wilfrid&#x27;s mischief is intentional. He hangs around most often with Spotty and &#x27;Erbert and, occasionally, Sidney. In the academy storyline Wilfrid apparently has a large chin under his jersey, but it is prosthetic and he pulls it off.
===Cuthbert===

Cuthbert Jason Cringeworthy, the brightest student in the class, is a teacher&#x27;s pet and has a name for every letter of the alphabet. First appearing in 1972, he resembles a miniature Teacher (a play on the D. C. Thomson comic tradition that pets resemble their owners, like Dennis the Menace and Gnasher) and Walter the Softy from &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;. The first thing Danny said about Cuthbert was, &quot;He reminds me of someone I don&#x27;t particularly like&quot;. His character has evolved slightly; although he still swots and is as bright as ever, particularly in longer strips by Mike Pearse and Kev F. Sutherland he is one of the gang (unlike earlier strips, where he seemed to dislike the other kids) and sometimes comes up with intelligent ideas to help their cause or save the school. Cuthbert wants to be like the other kids, but although he is liked he does not quite fit in. The school janitor observes that he will never make any friends. Cuthbert is the only kid who wears the school uniform and turns in homework. A school-dance strip hints at a crush on Toots, but she quickly rejects him. Cuthbert appears in the fewest strips of all the characters.
=== Harsha ===
Harsha Chandra, a British girl of Indian descent, joined Class 2B in June 2021. She already appeared in another strip, &quot;Har Har&#x27;s Joke Shop&quot;, which is about her family and the joke shop her father Hari &quot;Har Har&quot; Chandra owns. She&#x27;s a prankster similar to Tricky Dicky.

=== Mandi ===
Mandi, full name Mandira Sharma, another British girl of Indian descent, also joined Class 2B in June 2021. She previously had her own occasional strip that dealt with mental health issues to promote a charity, and as such her main trait is that she worries about things.

=== Stevie ===
Steven &quot;Super Star&quot; joined Class 2B in Wednesday 8 June 2022. He has his own strip of the same name. He wants to be famous. He is a black British boy, who is part American, as his Dad&#x27;s side of the family is from there.

=== Khadija ===
Khadija Raad, or Sketch Khad, joined Class 2B in Wednesday 8 June 2022. She is a Muslim and likes to draw on her Sketch pad, with any thing drawn on it coming to life.

=== Mahira ===
Mahira Salim, a British girl of Pakistani descent, joined Class 2B in Wednesday 8 June 2022. She has her own strip called &quot;Mahira of the Match&quot;. She likes football and is often regarded somewhat as a female version of Ball Boy.

== Other characters ==







Some characters (Teacher and Head, for example) are named after their occupations. The children&#x27;s parents (who look almost exactly like their children) are called Plug&#x27;s Dad and so on, even in flashbacks to &quot;their&quot; childhoods.

In the early years, there were an indeterminate number of students; one page had 28, including:
* Teddy – A stereotypical Teddy Boy, appearing primarily during the 1950s
* Ella – Another girl
* Jimmy – A boy resembling Smiffy, who wears a cap
* Gasbag Jones – A curly-haired boy

The characters appeared in one-page stories (not comic strips) entitled &quot;Bash St. School&quot; in &quot;The Wizard&quot; in 1955, and were the full-page cover cartoon on 23 July 1955.

== Artists ==
Leo Baxendale drew the strip until 1962, when David Sutherland replaced him. Sutherland originally used a similar drawing style to Baxendale&#x27;s, simplifying it later in the decade. He has drawn most of the strips since then, except from 1998 to 2000 (when Nigel Parkinson took over the strip in a style similar to that of David Parkins in &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;.) The strips have had a closely connected visual style since the early 1970s, when Sutherland began drawing them both. Although he was apparently easing into semi-retirement, Parkinson moved to &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; in 2000 and Sutherland returned. Sutherland continued drawing the strip until he died in 2023, at the age of 89.

The strip has had a number of ghost artists, including Gordon Bell during the early 1970s, John Sherwood later in the decade, Keith Reynolds during the 1980s and Tom Paterson in the early 1990s. Mike Pearse and Kev F. Sutherland (no relation to David Sutherland) have occasionally drawn the strip, long stories in particular. Following Sutherland&#x27;s death, Shannon Gallant and Mychailo Kazybrid both acted as temporary artists in the following months, before Gallant was appointed as Sutherland&#x27;s permanent replacement.

== Spin-offs and other appearances ==
&quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; has had a number of spin-offs, including &quot;Pup Parade&quot;, &quot;Simply Smiffy&quot;, &quot;Plug&quot; and &quot;Singled Out&quot;. &quot;The Bash Street Kids Annual&quot;, previously known as &quot;The Bash Street Kids Book&quot; and published biannually, is published in August. Summer specials, with solo stories of each character, were also published during the 1990s and were a forerunner to &quot;Singled Out&quot;. Most were drawn by Tom Paterson, who later drew the &quot;Singled Out&quot; strip.
From 1968 to 1972 &quot;The Beano&quot; ran a similar series, &quot;The Belles of St. Lemons&quot;.

&quot;The Dandy&quot; has had two similar series: the 1970s &quot;Whacko&quot; (about a teacher who taught in a suit of armour because of his unruly pupils) and &quot;P5&quot; from 1998 to 2000, also about a class and their long-suffering teacher. &quot;P5&quot; was republished in 2006 as &quot;Class Act&quot;.

===Singled Out===

Singled Out was a spin-off comic strip in the UK comic &quot;The Beano&quot;. Based on The Bash Street Kids, Singled Out focuses on one character each week and builds a one-page story around them. It first appeared in issue 3226, dated 15 May 2004, drawn by Mike Pearse. Mike Pearse has also included other Beano faces in his strips such as Dennis the Menace, Bea and The Three Bears.

Pearse drew the strip until mid-2007, when the job was given to Nigel Parkinson, and then Tom Paterson. David Sutherland also drew a single strip. Paterson&#x27;s trademark background images, such as the randomly positioned socks, are often included. The bottom left-hand corner of the page no longer shows which character the strip is focused on. Some strips mentioned which character was being featured in the header, but others didn&#x27;t provide any information on this. After the 2009 Bash Street Kids annual (Space Cadets) was published, Paterson&#x27;s work on Singled Out was changed to be more like Pearse&#x27;s style, where before it was akin to David Sutherland&#x27;s style, while Nigel Parkinson drew it in the Beano&#x27;s sister comic, BeanoMAX. Several of the early Mike Pearse stories were reprinted in the 2010 Bash Street Kids annual. The strip appeared on an increasingly less regular basis in 2009, and has since ended. There was a Singled Out reprint strip shown a few years later (under the title &quot;Bash Street Capers&quot;), but this was (quite oddly as it was labelled No.1) a one-off.

== In other media ==
=== Video ===
The Bash Street Kids appear in 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Beano Video&quot; and 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Beano Videostars&quot;; they also appear singing two songs: &quot;The Beano Rap&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re the Kids From Bash Street School&quot;.

=== Theme parks ===
Before Beanoland became Wild Asia at the Chessington World of Adventures, it included the Bash Street Bus. The kids were also featured in the water-balloon portion of the park, and their standees were posted at a number of locations.

=== Video games ===
Plug is a playable character in &quot;Beanotown Racing&quot; for the PC, and the school is a race track.

=== Toys and games ===
Robert Harrop has designed figures, statues and ornaments based on &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot;. A target-practice game featured the characters, and a McDonald&#x27;s Happy Meal toy set included a number of the kids.

<doc id="54673" wikidata="Q5326834" url="?curid=54673" title="Early infanticidal childrearing">
<text>Early infanticidal childrearing is a term used in the study of psychohistory that refers to infanticide in paleolithic, pre-historical, and historical hunter-gatherer tribes or societies. &quot;Early&quot; means early in history or in the cultural development of a society, not to the age of the child. &quot;Infanticidal&quot; refers to the high incidence of infants killed when compared to modern nations. The model was developed by Lloyd deMause within the framework of psychohistory as part of a seven-stage sequence of childrearing modes that describe the development attitudes towards children in human cultures The word &quot;early&quot; distinguishes the term from late infanticidal childrearing, identified by deMause in the more established, agricultural cultures up to the ancient world.

==The model==
This model is a psychological concept that aims to understand anthropological data, especially from such societies as the Yolngu of Australia, the Gimi, Wogeo, Bena Bena, and Bimin-Kuskusmin of Papua New Guinea, the Raum, the Ok, and the Kwanga, based on observations by Géza Róheim, Lia Leibowitz, Robert C. Suggs, Milton Diamond, Herman Heinrich Ploss, Gilbert Herdt, Robert J. Stoller, L. L. Langness, and Fitz John Porter Poole, among others. While anthropologists and psychohistorians do not dispute the data, they dispute its significance in terms of its importance, its meaning, and its interpretation.

Supporters attempt to explain cultural history from a psycho-developmental point of view, and argue that cultural change can be assessed as &quot;advancement&quot; or &quot;regression&quot; based on the psychological consequences of various cultural practices. While most anthropologists reject this approach and most theories of cultural evolution as ethnocentric, psychohistorians proclaim the independence of psychohistory and reject the mainstream Boasian view.

This &quot;infanticidal&quot; model makes several claims: that childrearing in tribal societies included child sacrifice or high infanticide rates, incest, body mutilation, child rape, and tortures, and that such activities were culturally acceptable. Psychohistorians do not claim that each child was killed, only that in some societies there was (or is) a selection process that would vary from culture to culture. For example, there is a large jump in the mortality rate of Papua New Guinean children after they reach the weaning stage. In the Solomon Islands some people reportedly kill their first-born child. In rural India, rural China, and other societies, some female babies have been exposed to death. DeMause&#x27;s argument is that the surviving siblings of the sacrificed child may become disturbed.

Some states, both in the Old World and New World, practiced infanticide, including sacrifice in Mesoamerica and in Assyrian and Canaanite religions. Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and other members of early states sacrificed infants to their gods, as described in the table of the psychopathological effects of some forms of childrearing.

According to deMause, in the most primitive mode of childrearing of the above-mentioned table, mothers use their children to project parts of their dissociated self onto their children. The infanticidal clinging of the symbiotic mother prevents individuation so that innovation and more complex political organization are inhibited. On a second plane, deMause maintains that the attention paid by mothers of some contemporary societies to their children, such as sucking, fondling, and masturbating, is sexual according to an objective standard; and that this sexual attention is inordinate.

The model is based on a reported lack of empathy by infanticidal parents, such as a lack of mutual gazes between parent and child, observed by Robert B. Edgerton, Maria Lepowsky, Bruce Knauft, John W. M. Whiting, and Margaret Mead, among others. Such mutual gazing is widely recognized in developmental psychology as crucial for proper bonding between mother and child.

==Criticism==
Nineteenth-century British anthropology advanced a lineal, evolutionary sequence in a given culture from savagery to civilization. Cultures were seen on a hierarchical ladder. James George Frazer posited a universal progress from magical thinking to science. Most anthropologists of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century studied primitive cultures outside Europe and North America. John Ferguson McLennan, Lewis Henry Morgan, and others argued that there was a parallel development in social institutions. In the 1950s, led by Leslie White, these evolutionist ideas gained influence in American anthropology.

The German-born Franz Boas managed to shift the paradigm. His approach, later named cultural relativism, resists universal values of any kind. According to Boas&#x27;s principle, which represents the mainstream school in contemporary anthropology, a culture&#x27;s beliefs and activities should be interpreted in the context of its own culture. This principle has been established as axiomatic in contemporary anthropology. The Vietnam War consolidated the Boasian shift in American anthropology.

Since the psychohistorians&#x27; model is analogous to the now discarded unilineal evolution theory, anthropologists have been critical of the negative value judgments, and the lineal progression, in the model currently advanced by psychohistorians as to what constitutes child abuse in primitive or non-Western cultures. Melvin Konner wrote:

Lloyd deMause, then editor of the &quot;History of Childhood Quarterly&quot;, claimed that all past societies treated children brutally, and that all historical change in their treatment has been a fairly steady improvement toward the kind and gentle standards we now set and more or less meet. [...] Now anthropologists — and many historians as well — were slack-jawed and nearly speechless. [...] Serious students of the anthropology of childhood beginning with Margaret Mead have called attention to the pervasive love and care lavished on children in many traditional cultures.

Psychohistorians accuse anthropologists and ethnologists of having avoided looking more closely at the evidence and having promulgated the myth of the noble savage. They maintain that what constitutes child abuse is a matter of a general psychological law, it leaves its permanent marks on the human brain structure, post-traumatic stress disorder is not a culture dependent phenomenon or a matter of opinion, and that some of the practices that mainstream anthropologists do not focus on, such as beatings of newborn infants, result in brain lesions and other visible neurological and psychological damage.

<text>In Ancient Roman architecture, a basilica (Greek Basiliké) was a large public building with multiple functions that was typically built alongside the town&#x27;s forum. The basilica was in the Latin West equivalent to a stoa in the Greek East. The building gave its name to the &quot;basilica&quot; architectural form.

Originally, a basilica was an ancient Roman public building, where courts were held, as well as serving other official and public functions. Basilicas are typically rectangular buildings with a central nave flanked by two or more longitudinal aisles, with the roof at two levels, being higher in the centre over the nave to admit a clerestory and lower over the side-aisles. An apse at one end, or less frequently at both ends or on the side, usually contained the raised tribunal occupied by the Roman magistrates. The basilica was centrally located in every Roman town, usually adjacent to the forum and often opposite a temple in imperial-era forums. Basilicas were also built in private residences and imperial palaces and were known as &quot;palace basilicas&quot;.

In late antiquity, church buildings were typically constructed either as martyria, or with a basilica&#x27;s architectural plan. A number of monumental Christian basilicas were constructed during the latter reign of Constantine the Great. In the post Nicene period, basilicas became a standard model for Christian spaces for congregational worship throughout the Mediterranean and Europe. From the early 4th century, Christian basilicas, along with their associated catacombs, were used for burial of the dead.

By extension, the name was later applied to Christian churches that adopted the same basic plan. It continues to be used in an architectural sense to describe rectangular buildings with a central nave and aisles, and usually a raised platform at the end opposite the door. In Europe and the Americas, the basilica remained the most common architectural style for churches of all Christian denominations, though this building plan has become less dominant in buildings constructed since the late 20th century.

The Catholic Church has come to use the term to refer to its especially historic churches, without reference to the architectural form.

== Origins ==
The Latin word &quot;&quot; derives from . The first known basilica—the Basilica Porcia in the Roman Forum—was constructed in 184 BC by Marcus Porcius Cato (the Elder). After the construction of Cato the Elder&#x27;s basilica, the term came to be applied to any large covered hall, whether it was used for domestic purposes, was a commercial space, a military structure, or religious building.

The plays of Plautus suggest that basilica buildings may have existed prior to Cato&#x27;s building. The plays were composed between 210 and 184 BC and refer to a building that might be identified with the &quot;Atrium Regium&quot;. Another early example is the basilica at Pompeii (late 2nd century BC). Inspiration may have come from prototypes like Athens&#x27;s Stoa Basileios or the hypostyle hall on Delos, but the architectural form is most derived from the audience halls in the royal palaces of the Diadochi kingdoms of the Hellenistic period. These rooms were typically a high nave flanked by colonnades.

These basilicas were rectangular, typically with central nave and aisles, usually with a slightly raised platform and an apse at each of the two ends, adorned with a statue perhaps of the emperor, while the entrances were from the long sides. The Roman &quot;basilica&quot; was a large public building where business or legal matters could be transacted. Although their form was variable, basilicas often contained interior colonnades that divided the space, giving aisles or arcaded spaces on one or both sides, with an apse at one end (or less often at each end), where the magistrates sat, often on a slightly raised dais. The central aisle the nave tended to be wider and taller than the flanking aisles, so that light could penetrate through the clerestory windows.

In the late Republican era, basilicas were increasingly monumental; Julius Caesar replaced the Basilica Sempronia with his own Basilica Julia, dedicated in 46 BC, while the Basilica Aemilia was rebuilt around 54 BC in so spectacular a fashion that Pliny the Elder wrote that it was among the most beautiful buildings in the world (it was simultaneously renamed the &quot;Basilica Paulli&quot;). Thereafter until the 4th century AD, monumental basilicas were routinely constructed at Rome by both private citizens and the emperors. These basilicas were reception halls and grand spaces in which élite persons could impress guests and visitors, and could be attached to a large country &quot;villa&quot; or an urban &quot;domus&quot;. They were simpler and smaller than were civic basilicas, and can be identified by inscriptions or their position in the archaeological context. Domitian constructed a basilica on the Palatine Hill for his imperial residential complex around 92 AD, and a palatine basilica was typical in imperial palaces throughout the imperial period.

== Roman Republic ==

Long, rectangular basilicas with internal peristyle became a quintessential element of Roman urbanism, often forming the architectural background to the city forum and used for diverse purposes. Beginning with Cato in the early second century BC, politicians of the Roman Republic competed with one another by building basilicas bearing their names in the Forum Romanum, the centre of ancient Rome. Outside the city, basilicas symbolised the influence of Rome and became a ubiquitous fixture of Roman of the late Republic from . The earliest surviving basilica is the basilica of Pompeii, built 120 BC. Basilicas were the administrative and commercial centres of major Roman settlements: the &quot;quintessential architectural expression of Roman administration&quot;. Adjoining it there were normally various offices and rooms housing the &quot;curia&quot; and a shrine for the tutela. Like Roman public baths, basilicas were commonly used as venues for the display of honorific statues and other sculptures, complementing the outdoor public spaces and thoroughfares.

Beside the Basilica Porcia on the &quot;Forum Romanum&quot;, the Basilica Aemilia was built in 179 BC, and the Basilica Sempronia in 169 BC. In the Republic two types of basilica were built across Italy in the mid-2nd to early 1st centuries BC: either they were nearly square as at Fanum Fortunae, designed by Vitruvius, and Cosa, with a 3:4 width-length ratio; or else they were more rectangular, as Pompeii&#x27;s basilica, whose ratio is 3:7.

The basilica at Ephesus is typical of the basilicas in the Roman East, which usually have a very elongated footprint and a ratio between 1:5 and 1:9, with open porticoes facing the &quot;agora&quot; (the Hellenic forum); this design was influenced by the existing tradition of long &quot;stoae&quot; in Hellenistic Asia. Provinces in the west lacked this tradition, and the basilicas the Romans commissioned there were more typically Italian, with the central nave divided from the side-aisles by an internal colonnade in regular proportions.


== Early Empire ==
Beginning with the Forum of Caesar () at the end of the Roman Republic, the centre of Rome was embellished with a series of imperial fora typified by a large open space surrounded by a peristyle, honorific statues of the imperial family (), and a basilica, often accompanied by other facilities like a temple, market halls and public libraries. In the imperial period, statues of the emperors with inscribed dedications were often installed near the basilicas&#x27; tribunals, as Vitruvius recommended. Examples of such dedicatory inscriptions are known from basilicas at Lucus Feroniae and Veleia in Italy and at Cuicul in Africa Proconsolaris, and inscriptions of all kinds were visible in and around basilicas.

At Ephesus the basilica-&quot;stoa&quot; had two storeys and three aisles and extended the length of the civic &quot;agora&quot;&#x27;s north side, complete with colossal statues of the emperor Augustus and his imperial family.

The remains of a large subterranean Neopythagorean basilica dating from the 1st century AD were found near the Porta Maggiore in Rome in 1917, and is known as the Porta Maggiore Basilica.

After its destruction in 60 AD, Londinium (London) was endowed with its first forum and basilica under the Flavian dynasty. The basilica delimited the northern edge of the forum with typical nave, aisles, and a tribunal, but with an atypical semi-basement at the western side. Unlike in Gaul, basilica-forum complexes in Roman Britain did not usually include a temple; instead a shrine was usually inside the basilica itself. At Londinium however, there was probably no temple at all attached to the original basilica, but instead a contemporary temple was constructed nearby. Later, in 79 AD, an inscription commemorated the completion of the basilica at Verulamium (St Albans) under the governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola; by contrast the first basilica at Londinium was only . The smallest known basilica in Britain was built by the Silures at Caerwent and measured .

When Londinium became a , the whole city was re-planned and a new great forum-basilica complex erected, larger than any in Britain. Londinium&#x27;s basilica, more than long, was the largest north of the Alps and a similar length to the modern St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Only the later basilica-forum complex at Treverorum was larger, while at Rome only the Basilica Ulpia exceeded London&#x27;s in size. It probably had arcaded, rather than trabeate, aisles, and a double row of square offices on the northern side, serving as the administrative centre of the , and its size and splendour probably indicate an imperial decision to change the administrative capital of Britannia to Londinium from Camulodunum (Colchester), as all provincial capitals were designated &quot;coloniae&quot;. In 300 Londinium&#x27;s basilica was destroyed as a result of the rebellion led by the &quot;Augustus&quot; of the break-away Britannic Empire, Carausius. Remains of the great basilica and its arches were discovered during the construction of Leadenhall Market in the 1880s.

At Corinth in the 1st century AD, a new basilica was constructed in on the east side of the forum. It was possibly inside the basilica that Paul the Apostle, according to the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; (&quot;Acts&quot; 18:12–17) was investigated and found innocent by the Suffect Consul Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus, the brother of Seneca the Younger, after charges were brought against him by members of the local Jewish diaspora. Modern tradition instead associates the incident with an open-air inscribed &quot;bema&quot; in the forum itself.

The emperor Trajan constructed his own imperial forum in Rome accompanied by his Basilica Ulpia dedicated in 112. Trajan&#x27;s Forum () was separated from the Temple of Trajan, the Ulpian Library, and his famous Column depicting the Dacian Wars by the Basilica. It was an especially grand example whose particular symmetrical arrangement with an apse at both ends was repeated in the provinces as a characteristic form. To improve the quality of the Roman concrete used in the Basilica Ulpia, volcanic scoria from the Bay of Naples and Mount Vesuvius were imported which, though heavier, was stronger than the pumice available closer to Rome. The Bailica Ulpia is probably an early example of tie bars to restrain the lateral thrust of the barrel vault resting on a colonnade; both tie-bars and scoria were used in contemporary work at the Baths of Trajan and later the Hadrianic domed vault of the Pantheon.

In early 123, the &quot;augusta&quot; and widow of the emperor Trajan, Pompeia Plotina died. Hadrian, successor to Trajan, deified her and had a basilica constructed in her honour in southern Gaul.

The Basilica Hilariana (built ) was designed for the use of the cult of Cybele.

The largest basilica built outside Rome was that built under the Antonine dynasty on the Byrsa hill in Carthage. The basilica was built together with a forum of enormous size and was contemporary with a great complex of public baths and a new aqueduct system running for , then the longest in the Roman Empire.

The basilica at Leptis Magna, built by the Septimius Severus a century later in about 216 is a notable 3rd century AD example of the traditional type, most notable among the works influenced by the Basilica Ulpia. The basilica at Leptis was built mainly of limestone ashlar, but the apses at either end were only limestone in the outer sections and built largely of rubble masonry faced with brick, with a number of decorative panels in &quot;opus reticulatum&quot;. The basilica stood in a new forum and was accompanied by a programme of Severan works at Leptis including &quot;thermae&quot;, a new harbour, and a public fountain. At Volubilis, principal city of Mauretania Tingitana, a basilica modelled on Leptis Magna&#x27;s was completed during the short reign of Macrinus.

== Late antiquity ==


The aisled-hall plan of the basilica was adopted by a number of religious cults in late antiquity. At Sardis, a monumental basilica housed the city&#x27;s synagogue, serving the local Jewish diaspora. New religions like Christianity required space for congregational worship, and the basilica was adapted by the early Church for worship. Because they were able to hold large number of people, basilicas were adopted for Christian liturgical use after Constantine the Great. The early churches of Rome were basilicas with an apsidal tribunal and used the same construction techniques of columns and timber roofing.

At the start of the 4th century at Rome there was a change in burial and funerary practice, moving away from earlier preferences for inhumation in cemeteries popular from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD to the newer practice of burial in catacombs and inhumation inside Christian basilicas themselves. Conversely, new basilicas often were erected on the site of existing early Christian cemeteries and &quot;martyria&quot;, related to the belief in Bodily Resurrection, and the cult of the sacred dead became monumentalised in basilica form. Traditional civic basilicas and &quot;bouleuteria&quot; declined in use with the weakening of the curial class () in the 4th and 5th centuries, while their structures were well suited to the requirements of congregational liturgies. The conversion of these types of buildings into Christian basilicas was also of symbolic significance, asserting the dominance of Christianity and supplanting the old political function of public space and the city-centre with an emphatic Christian social statement. Traditional monumental civic amenities like &quot;gymnasia&quot;, &quot;palaestrae&quot;, and &quot;thermae&quot; were also falling into disuse, and became favoured sites for the construction of new churches, including basilicas.

Under Constantine, the basilica became the most prestigious style of church building, was &quot;normative&quot; for church buildings by the end of the 4th century, and were ubiquitous in western Asia, North Africa, and most of Europe by the close of the 7th century. Christians also continued to hold services in synagogues, houses, and gardens, and continued practising baptism in rivers, ponds, and Roman bathhouses.

The development of Christian basilicas began even before Constantine&#x27;s reign: a 3rd-century mud-brick house at Aqaba had become a Christian church and was rebuilt as a basilica. Within was a rectangular assembly hall with frescoes and at the east end an ambo, a cathedra, and an altar. Also within the church were a catecumenon (for catechumens), a baptistery, a diaconicon, and a prothesis: all features typical of later 4th century basilica churches. A Christian structure which included the prototype of the triumphal arch at the east end of later Constantinian basilicas. Known as the Megiddo church, it was built at Kefar &#x27;Othnay in Palestine, possibly c. 230, for or by the Roman army stationed at Legio (later Lajjun). Its dedicatory inscriptions include the names of women who contributed to the building and were its major patrons, as well as men&#x27;s names. A number of buildings previously believed to have been Constantinian or 4th century have been reassessed as dating to later periods, and certain examples of 4th century basilicas are not distributed throughout the Mediterranean world at all evenly. Christian basilicas and &quot;martyria&quot; attributable to the 4th century are rare on the Greek mainland and on the Cyclades, while the Christian basilicas of Egypt, Cyprus, Syria, Transjordan, Hispania, and Gaul are nearly all of later date. The basilica at Ephesus&#x27;s &quot;Magnesian Gate&quot;, the episcopal church at Laodicea on the Lycus, and two extramural churches at Sardis have all been considered 4th century constructions, but on weak evidence. Development of pottery chronologies for Late Antiquity had helped resolve questions of dating basilicas of the period.

Three examples of a &quot;basilica discoperta&quot; or &quot;hypaethral basilica&quot; with no roof above the nave are inferred to have existed. The 6th century Anonymous pilgrim of Piacenza described a &quot;basilica built with a &quot;quadriporticus&quot;, with the middle atrium uncovered&quot; at Hebron, while at Pécs and near Salona two ruined 5th buildings of debated interpretation might have been either roofless basilica churches or simply courtyards with an exedra at the end. An old theory by Ejnar Dyggve that these were the architectural intermediary between the Christian &quot;martyrium&quot; and the classical &quot;heröon&quot; is no longer credited.

The magnificence of early Christian basilicas reflected the patronage of the emperor and recalled his imperial palaces and reflected the royal associations of the basilica with the Hellenistic Kingdoms and even earlier monarchies like that of Pharaonic Egypt. Similarly, the name and association resounded with the Christian claims of the royalty of Christ – according to the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; the earliest Christians had gathered at the royal &quot;Stoa&quot; of Solomon in Jerusalem to assert Jesus&#x27;s royal heritage. For early Christians, the Bible supplied evidence that the First Temple and Solomon&#x27;s palace were both hypostyle halls and somewhat resembled basilicas. Hypostyle synagogues, often built with apses in Palestine by the 6th century, share a common origin with the Christian basilicas in the civic basilicas and in the pre-Roman style of hypostyle halls in the Mediterranean Basin, particularly in Egypt, where pre-classical hypostyles continued to be built in the imperial period and were themselves converted into churches in the 6th century. Other influences on the evolution of Christian basilicas may have come from elements of domestic and palatial architecture during the pre-Constantinian period of Christianity, including the reception hall or () and the &quot;atria&quot; and &quot;triclinia&quot; of élite Roman dwellings. The versatility of the basilica form and its variability in size and ornament recommended itself to the early Christian Church: basilicas could be grandiose as the Basilica of Maxentius in the &quot;Forum Romanum&quot; or more practical like the so-called Basilica of Bahira in Bosra, while the &quot;Basilica Constantiniana&quot; on the Lateran Hill was of intermediate scale. This basilica, begun in 313, was the first imperial Christian basilica. Imperial basilicas were first constructed for the Christian Eucharist liturgy in the reign of Constantine.

Basilica churches were not economically inactive. Like non-Christian or civic basilicas, basilica churches had a commercial function integral to their local trade routes and economies. Amphorae discovered at basilicas attest their economic uses and can reveal their position in wider networks of exchange. At Dion near Mount Olympus in Macedonia, now an Archaeological Park, the latter 5th century &quot;Cemetery Basilica&quot;, a small church, was replete with potsherds from all over the Mediterranean, evidencing extensive economic activity took place there. Likewise at Maroni Petrera on Cyprus, the amphorae unearthed by archaeologists in the 5th century basilica church had been imported from North Africa, Egypt, Palestine, and the Aegean basin, as well as from neighbouring Asia Minor.

According to Vegetius, writing c. 390, basilicas were convenient for drilling soldiers of the Late Roman army during inclement weather.

=== Basilica of Maxentius ===


The 4th century Basilica of Maxentius, begun by Maxentius between 306 and 312 and according to Aurelius Victor&#x27;s &quot;De Caesaribus&quot; completed by Constantine I, was an innovation. Earlier basilicas mostly had wooden roofs, but this basilica dispensed with timber trusses and used instead cross-vaults made from Roman bricks and concrete to create one of the ancient world&#x27;s largest covered spaces: 80 m long, 25 m wide, and 35 m high. The vertices of the cross-vaults, the largest Roman examples, were 35 m. The vault was supported on marble monolithic columns 14.5 m tall. The foundations are as much as 8 m deep. The vault was supported by brick latticework ribs () forming lattice ribbing, an early form of rib vault, and distributing the load evenly across the vault&#x27;s span. Similar brick ribs were employed at the Baths of Maxentius on the Palatine Hill, where they supported walls on top of the vault. Also known as the or , it chanced to be the last civic basilica built in Rome.

Inside the basilica the central nave was accessed by five doors opening from an entrance hall on the eastern side and terminated in an apse at the western end. Another, shallower apse with niches for statues was added to the centre of the north wall in a second campaign of building, while the western apse housed a colossal acrolithic statue of the emperor Constantine enthroned. Fragments of this statue are now in the courtyard of the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Hill, part of the Capitoline Museums. Opposite the northern apse on the southern wall, another monumental entrance was added and elaborated with a portico of porphyry columns. One of the remaining marble interior columns was removed in 1613 by Pope Paul V and set up as an honorific column outside Santa Maria Maggiore.

=== Constantinian period ===

In the early 4th century Eusebius used the word basilica () to refer to Christian churches; in subsequent centuries as before, the word basilica referred in Greek to the civic, non-ecclesiastical buildings, and only in rare exceptions to churches. Churches were nonetheless basilican in form, with an apse or tribunal at the end of a nave with two or more aisles typical. A narthex (sometimes with an exonarthex) or vestibule could be added to the entrance, together with an atrium, and the interior might have transepts, a pastophorion, and galleries, but the basic scheme with clerestory windows and a wooden truss roof remained the most typical church type until the 6th century. The nave would be kept clear for liturgical processions by the clergy, with the laity in the galleries and aisles to either side. The function of Christian churches was similar to that of the civic basilicas but very different from temples in contemporary Graeco-Roman polytheism: while pagan temples were entered mainly by priests and thus had their splendour visible from without, within Christian basilicas the main ornamentation was visible to the congregants admitted inside. Christian priests did not interact with attendees during the rituals which took place at determined intervals, whereas pagan priests were required to perform individuals&#x27; sacrifices in the more chaotic environment of the temple precinct, with the temple&#x27;s façade as backdrop. In basilicas constructed for Christian uses, the interior was often decorated with frescoes, but these buildings&#x27; wooden roof often decayed and failed to preserve the fragile frescoes within. Thus was lost an important part of the early history of Christian art, which would have sought to communicate early Christian ideas to the mainly illiterate Late Antique society. On the exterior, basilica church complexes included cemeteries, baptisteries, and fonts which &quot;defined ritual and liturgical access to the sacred&quot;, elevated the social status of the Church hierarchy, and which complemented the development of a Christian historical landscape; Constantine and his mother Helena were patrons of basilicas in important Christian sites in the Holy Land and Rome, and at Milan and Constantinople.

Around 310, while still a self-proclaimed &quot;augustus&quot; unrecognised at Rome, Constantine began the construction of the &quot;Basilica Constantiniana&quot; or , as a reception hall for his imperial seat at Trier (), capital of Belgica Prima. On the exterior, Constantine&#x27;s palatine basilica was plain and utilitarian, but inside was very grandly decorated.

In the reign of Constantine I, a basilica was constructed for the Pope in the former barracks of the &quot;Equites singulares Augusti&quot;, the cavalry arm of the Praetorian Guard. (Constantine had disbanded the Praetorian guard after his defeat of their emperor Maxentius and replaced them with another bodyguard, the &quot;Scholae Palatinae&quot;.) In 313 Constantine began construction of the &quot;Basilica Constantiniana&quot; on the Lateran Hill. This basilica became Rome&#x27;s cathedral church, known as St John Lateran, and was more richly decorated and larger than any previous Christian structure. However, because of its remote position from the &quot;Forum Romanum&quot; on the city&#x27;s edge, it did not connect with the older imperial basilicas in the fora of Rome. Outside the basilica was the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius, a rare example of an Antique statue that has never been underground.

According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Constantine was also responsible for the rich interior decoration of the Lateran Baptistery constructed under Pope Sylvester I (r. 314–335), sited about . The Lateran Baptistery was the first monumental free-standing baptistery, and in subsequent centuries Christian basilica churches were often endowed with such baptisteries.

At Cirta, a Christian basilica erected by Constantine was taken over by his opponents, the Donatists. After Constantine&#x27;s failure to resolve the Donatist controversy by coercion between 317 and 321, he allowed the Donatists, who dominated Africa, to retain the basilica and constructed a new one for the Catholic Church.

The original titular churches of Rome were those which had been private residences and which were donated to be converted to places of Christian worship. Above an originally 1st century AD villa and its later adjoining warehouse and Mithraeum, a large basilica church had been erected by 350, subsuming the earlier structures beneath it as a crypt. The basilica was the first church of San Clemente al Laterano. Similarly, at Santi Giovanni e Paolo al Celio, an entire ancient city block – a 2nd-century &quot;insula&quot; on the Caelian Hill – was buried beneath a 4th-century basilica. The site was already venerated as the &quot;martyrium&quot; of three early Christian burials beforehand, and part of the &quot;insula&quot; had been decorated in the style favoured by Christian communities frequenting the early Catacombs of Rome.

By 350 in Serdica (Sofia, Bulgaria), a monumental basilica – the Church of Saint Sophia – was erected, covering earlier structures including a Christian chapel, an oratory, and a cemetery dated to c. 310. Other major basilica from this period, in this part of Europe, is the Great Basilica in Philippopolis (Plovdiv, Bulgaria) from the 4th century AD.

=== Valentinianic–Theodosian period ===
In the late 4th century the dispute between Nicene and Arian Christianity came to head at &quot;Mediolanum&quot; (Milan), where Ambrose was bishop. At Easter in 386 the Arian party, preferred by the Theodosian dynasty, sought to wrest the use of the basilica from the Nicene partisan Ambrose. According to Augustine of Hippo, the dispute resulted in Ambrose organising an &#x27;orthodox&#x27; sit-in at the basilica and arranged the miraculous invention and translation of martyrs, whose hidden remains had been revealed in a vision. During the sit-in, Augustine credits Ambrose with the introduction from the &quot;eastern regions&quot; of antiphonal chanting, to give heart to the orthodox congregation, though in fact music was likely part of Christian ritual since the time of the Pauline epistles. The arrival and reburial of the martyrs&#x27; uncorrupted remains in the basilica in time for the Easter celebrations was seen as powerful step towards divine approval.

At Philippi, the market adjoining the 1st-century forum was demolished and replaced with a Christian basilica. Civic basilicas throughout Asia Minor became Christian places of worship; examples are known at Ephesus, Aspendos, and at Magnesia on the Maeander. The &quot;Great Basilica&quot; in Antioch of Pisidia is a rare securely dated 4th century Christian basilica and was the city&#x27;s cathedral church. The mosaics of the floor credit Optimus, the bishop, with its dedication. Optimus was a contemporary of Basil of Caesarea and corresponded with him c. 377. Optimus was the city&#x27;s delegate at the First Council of Constantinople in 381, so the 70 m-long single-apsed basilica near the city walls must have been constructed around that time. Pisidia had a number of Christian basilicas constructed in Late Antiquity, particularly in former &quot;bouleuteria&quot;, as at Sagalassos, Selge, Pednelissus, while a civic basilica was converted for Christians&#x27; use in Cremna.

At Chalcedon, opposite Constantinople on the Bosporus, the relics of Euphemia – a supposed Christian martyr of the Diocletianic Persecution – were housed in a &quot;martyrium&quot; accompanied by a basilica. The basilica already existed when Egeria passed through Chalcedon in 384, and in 436 Melania the Younger visited the church on her own journey to the Holy Land. From the description of Evagrius Scholasticus the church is identifiable as an aisled basilica attached to the &quot;martyrium&quot; and preceded by an &quot;atrium&quot;. The Council of Chalcedon (8–31 October 451) was held in the basilica, which must have been large enough to accommodate the more than two hundred bishops that attended its third session, together with their translators and servants; around 350 bishops attended the Council in all. In an ekphrasis in his eleventh sermon, Asterius of Amasea described an icon in the church depicting Euphemia&#x27;s martyrdom. The church was restored under the patronage of the &quot;patricia&quot; and daughter of Olybrius&quot;,&quot; Anicia Juliana. Pope Vigilius fled there from Constantinople during the Three-Chapter Controversy. The basilica, which lay outside the walls of Chalcedon, was destroyed by the Persians in the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 during one of the Sasanian occupations of the city in 615 and 626. The relics of Euphemia were reportedly translated to a new Church of St Euphemia in Constantinople in 680, though Cyril Mango argued the translation never took place. Subsequently, Asterius&#x27;s sermon &quot;On the Martyrdom of St Euphemia&quot; was advanced as an argument for iconodulism at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.

In the late 4th century, a large basilica church dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus was constructed in Ephesus in the former south &quot;stoa&quot; (a commercial basilica) of the Temple of Hadrian &quot;Olympios&quot;. Ephesus was the centre of the Roman province of Asia, and was the site of the city&#x27;s famed Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It had also been a centre of the Roman imperial cult in Asia; Ephesus was three times declared () and had constructed a Temple of the Sebastoi to the Flavian dynasty. The Basilica of the Virgin Mary was probably the venue for the 431 Council of Ephesus and the 449 Second Council of Ephesus, both convened by Theodosius II. At some point during the Christianisation of the Roman world, Christian crosses were cut into the faces of the colossal statues of Augustus and Livia that stood in the basilica-&quot;stoa&quot; of Ephesus; the crosses were perhaps intended to exorcise demons in a process akin to baptism. In the eastern cemetery of Hierapolis the 5th century domed octagonal &quot;martyrium&quot; of Philip the Apostle was built alongside a basilica church, while at Myra the Basilica of St Nicholas was constructed at the tomb of Saint Nicholas.

At Constantinople the earliest basilica churches, like the 5th century basilica at the Monastery of Stoudios, were mostly equipped with a small cruciform crypt (), a space under the church floor beneath the altar. Typically, these crypts were accessed from the apse&#x27;s interior, though not always, as at the 6th century Church of St John at the Hebdomon, where access was from outside the apse. At Thessaloniki, the Roman bath where tradition held Demetrius of Thessaloniki had been martyred was subsumed beneath the 5th century basilica of Hagios Demetrios, forming a crypt.

The largest and oldest basilica churches in Egypt were at Pbow, a coenobitic monastery established by Pachomius the Great in 330. The 4th century basilica was replaced by a large 5th century building (36 × 72 m) with five aisles and internal colonnades of pink granite columns and paved with limestone. This monastery was the administrative centre of the Pachomian order where the monks would gather twice annually and whose library may have produced many surviving manuscripts of biblical, Gnostic, and other texts in Greek and Coptic. In North Africa, late antique basilicas were often built on a doubled plan. In the 5th century, basilicas with two apses, multiple aisles, and doubled churches were common, including examples respectively at Sufetula, Tipasa, and Djémila. Generally, North African basilica churches&#x27; altars were in the nave and the main building medium was &quot;opus africanum&quot; of local stone, and &quot;spolia&quot; was infrequently used.

The Church of the East&#x27;s Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was convened by the Sasanian Emperor Yazdegerd I at his capital at Ctesiphon; according to &quot;Synodicon Orientale&quot;, the emperor ordered that the former churches in the Sasanian Empire to be restored and rebuilt, that such clerics and ascetics as had been imprisoned were to be released, and their Nestorian Christian communities allowed to circulate freely and practice openly.

In eastern Syria, the Church of the East developed at typical pattern of basilica churches. Separate entrances for men and women were installed in the southern or northern wall; within, the east end of the nave was reserved for men, while women and children were stood behind. In the nave was a &quot;bema&quot;, from which Scripture could be read, and which were inspired by the equivalent in synagogues and regularised by the Church of Antioch. The Council of 410 stipulated that on Sunday the archdeacon would read the Gospels from the &quot;bema&quot;. Standing near the &quot;bema&quot;, the lay folk could chant responses to the reading and if positioned near the &quot;šqāqonā&quot; (&quot;a walled floor-level pathway connecting the &quot;bema&quot; to the altar area&quot;) could try to kiss or touch the Gospel Book as it was processed from the deacons&#x27; room to the &quot;bema&quot; and thence to the altar. Some ten Eastern churches in eastern Syria have been investigated by thorough archaeology.

A Christian basilica was constructed in the first half of the 5th century at Olympia, where the statue of Zeus by Phidias had been noted as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ever since the 2nd century BC list compiled by Antipater of Sidon. Cultural tourism thrived at Olympia and Ancient Greek religion continued to be practised there well into the 4th century. At Nicopolis in Epirus, founded by Augustus to commemorate his victory at the Battle of Actium at the end of the Last war of the Roman Republic, four early Christian basilicas were built during Late Antiquity whose remains survive to the present. In the 4th or 5th century, Nicopolis was surrounded by a new city wall.

In Bulgaria there are major basilicas from that time like Elenska Basilica and the Red Church.

=== Leonid period ===
On Crete, the Roman cities suffered from repeated earthquakes in the 4th century, but between c. 450 and c. 550, a large number of Christian basilicas were constructed. Crete was throughout Late Antiquity a province of the Diocese of Macedonia, governed from Thessaloniki.

Nine basilica churches were built at Nea Anchialos, ancient Phthiotic Thebes (), which was in its heyday the primary port of Thessaly. The episcopal see was the three-aisled &quot;Basilica A&quot;, the Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki, and similar to the Church of the Acheiropoietos in Thessaloniki. Its atrium perhaps had a pair of towers to either side and its construction dates to the late 5th/early 6th century. The Elpidios Basilica &quot;Basilica B&quot; was of similar age, and the city was home to a large complex of ecclesiastical buildings including &quot;Basilica G&quot;, with its luxurious mosaic floors and a mid-6th century inscription proclaiming the patronage of the bishop Peter. Outside the defensive wall was &quot;Basilica D&quot;, a 7th-century cemetery church.

Stobi, () the capital from the late 4th century of the province of Macedonia II Salutaris, had numerous basilicas and six palaces in late antiquity. The &quot;Old Basilica&quot; had two phases of geometric pavements, the second phase of which credited the bishop Eustathios as patron of the renovations. A newer episcopal basilica was built by the bishop Philip atop the remains of the earlier structure, and two further basilicas were within the walls. The &quot;Central Basilica&quot; replaced a synagogue on a site razed in the late 5th century, and there was also a &quot;North Basilica&quot; and further basilicas without the walls. Various mosaics and sculptural decorations have been found there, and while the city suffered from the Ostrogoths in 479 and an earthquake in 518, ceasing to be a major city thereafter, it remained a bishopric until the end of the 7th century and the &quot;Basilica of Philip&quot; had its &quot;templon&quot; restored in the 8th century.

The Small Basilica of Philippopolis (Plovdiv, Bulgaria) in Thrace was built in the second half of the 5th century AD.

=== Justinianic period ===
Justinian I constructed at Ephesus a large basilica church, the Basilica of St John, above the supposed tomb of John the Apostle. The church was a domed cruciform basilica begun in 535/6; enormous and lavishly decorated, it was built in the same style as Justinian&#x27;s Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. The Justinianic basilica replaced an earlier, smaller structure which Egeria had planned to visit in the 4th century, and remains of a aqueduct branch built to supply the complex with water probably dates from Justinian&#x27;s reign. The Ephesians&#x27; basilicas to St Mary and St John were both equipped with baptisteries with filling and draining pipes: both fonts were flush with the floor and unsuitable for infant baptism. As with most Justinianic baptisteries in the Balkans and Asia Minor, the baptistery at the Basilica of St John was on the northern side of the basilica&#x27;s nave; the 734 m2 baptistery was separated from the basilica by a 3 m-wide corridor. According to the 6th century Syriac writer John of Ephesus, a Syriac Orthodox Christian, the heterodox Miaphysites held ordination services in the courtyard of the Basilica of St John under cover of night. Somewhat outside the ancient city on the hill of Selçuk, the Justinianic basilica became the centre of the city after the 7th century Arab–Byzantine wars.

At Constantinople, Justinian constructed the largest domed basilica: on the site of the 4th century basilica Church of Holy Wisdom, the emperor ordered construction of the huge domed basilica that survives to the present: the Hagia Sophia. This basilica, which &quot;continues to stand as one of the most visually imposing and architecturally daring churches in the Mediterranean&quot;, was the cathedral of Constantinople and the patriarchal church of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Hagia Sophia, originally founded by Constantine, was at the social and political heart of Constantinople, near to the Great Palace, the Baths of Zeuxippus, and the Hippodrome of Constantinople, while the headquarters of the Ecumenical Patriarchate was within the basilica&#x27;s immediate vicinity.

The mid-6th century Bishop of Poreč ( or ; ) replaced an earlier 4th century basilica with the magnificent Euphrasian Basilica in the style of contemporary basilicas at Ravenna. Some column capitals were of marble from Greece identical to those in Basilica of San Vitale and must have been imported from the Byzantine centre along with the columns and some of the &quot;opus sectile&quot;. There are conch mosaics in the basilica&#x27;s three apses and the fine &quot;opus sectile&quot; on the central apse wall is &quot;exceptionally well preserved&quot;.

The 4th century basilica of Saint Sophia Church at Serdica (Sofia, Bulgaria) was rebuilt in the 5th century and ultimately replaced by a new monumental basilica in the late 6th century, and some construction phases continued into the 8th century. This basilica was the cathedral of Serdica and was one of three basilicas known to lie outside the walls; three more churches were within the walled city, of which the Church of Saint George was a former Roman bath built in the 4th century, and another was a former Mithraeum. The basilicas were associated with cemeteries with Christian inscriptions and burials.

Another basilica from this period in Bulgaria was the Belovo Basilica (6th century AD).

The Miaphysite convert from the Church of the East, Ahudemmeh constructed a new basilica dedicated to Saint Sergius at &quot;ʿ&quot;Ain Qenoye (or &quot;ʿ&quot;Ain Qena according to Bar Hebraeus) after being ordained bishop of Beth Arbaye by Jacob Baradaeus and while proselytizing among the Bedouin of Arbayistan in the Sasanian Empire. According to Ahudemmeh&#x27;s biographer this basilica and its &quot;martyrium&quot;, in the upper Tigris valley, was supposed to be a copy of the Basilica of St Sergius at Sergiopolis (Resafa), in the middle Euphrates, so that the Arabs would not have to travel so far on pilgrimage. More likely, with the support of Khosrow I for its construction and defence against the Nestorians who were Miaphysites&#x27; rivals, the basilica was part of an attempt to control the frontier tribes and limit their contact with the Roman territory of Justinian, who had agreed in the 562 Fifty-Year Peace Treaty to pay 30,000 &quot;nomismata&quot; annually to Khosrow in return for a demilitarization of the frontier after the latest phase of the Roman–Persian Wars. After being mentioned in 828 and 936, the basilica at &quot;ʿ&quot;Ain Qenoye disappeared from recorded history, though it may have remained occupied for centuries, and was rediscovered as a ruin by Carsten Niebuhr in 1766. The name of the modern site Qasr Serīj is derived from the basilica&#x27;s dedication to St Sergius. Qasr Serīj&#x27;s construction may have been part of the policy of toleration that Khosrow and his successors had for Miaphysitism a contrast with Justinian&#x27;s persecution of heterodoxy within the Roman empire. This policy itself encouraged many tribes to favour the Persian cause, especially after the death in 569 of the Ghassanid Kingdom&#x27;s Miaphysite king al-Harith ibn Jabalah (, ) and the 584 suppression by the Romans of his successors&#x27; dynasty.

=== Palace basilicas ===
In the Roman Imperial period (after about 27 BC), a basilica for large audiences also became a feature in palaces. In the 3rd century of the Christian era, the governing elite appeared less frequently in the forums.

They now tended to dominate their cities from opulent palaces and country villas, set a little apart from traditional centers of public life. Rather than retreats from public life, however, these residences were the forum made private.
:— Peter Brown, in Paul Veyne, 1987

Seated in the tribune of his basilica, the great man would meet his dependent &quot;clientes&quot; early every morning.

Constantine&#x27;s basilica at Trier, the Aula Palatina (AD 306), is still standing. A private basilica excavated at Bulla Regia (Tunisia), in the &quot;House of the Hunt&quot;, dates from the first half of the 5th century. Its reception or audience hall is a long rectangular nave-like space, flanked by dependent rooms that mostly also open into one another, ending in a semi-circular apse, with matching transept spaces. Clustered columns emphasised the &quot;crossing&quot; of the two axes.

=== Christian adoption of the basilica form ===

In the 4th century, once the Imperial authorities had decriminalised Christianity with the 313 Edict of Milan, and with the activities of Constantine the Great and his mother Helena, Christians were prepared to build larger and more handsome edifices for worship than the furtive meeting-places (such as the Cenacle, cave-churches, house churches such as that of the martyrs John and Paul) they had been using. Architectural formulas for temples were unsuitable due to their pagan associations, and because pagan cult ceremonies and sacrifices occurred outdoors under the open sky in the sight of the gods, with the temple, housing the cult figures and the treasury, as a backdrop. The usable model at hand, when Constantine wanted to memorialise his imperial piety, was the familiar conventional architecture of the basilicas.

There were several variations of the basic plan of the secular basilica, always some kind of rectangular hall, but the one usually followed for churches had a central nave with one aisle at each side and an apse at one end opposite to the main door at the other end. In (and often also in front of) the apse was a raised platform, where the altar was placed, and from where the clergy officiated. In secular building this plan was more typically used for the smaller audience halls of the emperors, governors, and the very rich than for the great public basilicas functioning as law courts and other public purposes. Constantine built a basilica of this type in his palace complex at Trier, later very easily adopted for use as a church. It is a long rectangle two storeys high, with ranks of arch-headed windows one above the other, without aisles (there was no mercantile exchange in this imperial basilica) and, at the far end beyond a huge arch, the apse in which Constantine held state.

==== Development ====
Putting an altar instead of the throne, as was done at Trier, made a church. Basilicas of this type were built in western Europe, Greece, Syria, Egypt, and Palestine, that is, at any early centre of Christianity. Good early examples of the architectural basilica include the Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem (6th century), the church of St Elias at Thessalonica (5th century), and the two great basilicas at Ravenna.

The first basilicas with transepts were built under the orders of Emperor Constantine, both in Rome and in his &quot;New Rome&quot;, Constantinople:

Around 380, Gregory Nazianzen, describing the Constantinian Church of the Holy Apostles at Constantinople, was the first to point out its resemblance to a cross. Because the cult of the cross was spreading at about the same time, this comparison met with stunning success.
:— Yvon Thébert, in Veyne, 1987

Thus, a Christian symbolic theme was applied quite naturally to a form borrowed from civil semi-public precedents. The first great Imperially sponsored Christian basilica is that of St John Lateran, which was given to the Bishop of Rome by Constantine right before or around the Edict of Milan in 313 and was consecrated in the year 324. In the later 4th century, other Christian basilicas were built in Rome: Santa Sabina, and St Paul&#x27;s Outside the Walls (4th century), and later St Clement (6th century).

A Christian basilica of the 4th or 5th century stood behind its entirely enclosed forecourt ringed with a colonnade or arcade, like the stoa or peristyle that was its ancestor or like the cloister that was its descendant. This forecourt was entered from outside through a range of buildings along the public street. This was the architectural ground-plan of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, until in the 15th century it was demolished to make way for a modern church built to a new plan.

In most basilicas, the central nave is taller than the aisles, forming a row of windows called a clerestory. Some basilicas in the Caucasus, particularly those of Armenia and Georgia, have a central nave only slightly higher than the two aisles and a single pitched roof covering all three. The result is a much darker interior. This plan is known as the &quot;oriental basilica&quot;, or &quot;pseudobasilica&quot; in central Europe. A peculiar type of basilica, known as three-church basilica, was developed in early medieval Georgia, characterised by the central nave which is completely separated from the aisles with solid walls.

Gradually, in the Early Middle Ages there emerged the massive Romanesque churches, which still kept the fundamental plan of the basilica.

In Medieval Bulgaria the Great Basilica was finished around 875. The architectural complex in Pliska, the first capital of the First Bulgarian Empire, included a cathedral, an archbishop&#x27;s palace and a monastery. The basilica was one of the greatest Christian cathedrals in Europe of the time, with an area of . The still in use Church of Saint Sophia in Ohrid is another example from Medieval Bulgaria.

In Romania, the word for church both as a building and as an institution is &quot;biserică&quot;, derived from the term basilica.

In the United States the style was copied with variances. An American church built imitating the architecture of an Early Christian basilica, St. Mary&#x27;s (German) Church in Pennsylvania, was demolished in 1997.

== Catholic basilicas ==

In the Catholic Church, a basilica is a church with special privileges. It is typically housed in a large and important building. This designation may be made by the Pope or may date from time immemorial. Basilica churches are distinguished for ceremonial purposes from other churches. The building does not need to be a basilica in the architectural sense. Basilicas are either major basilicas – of which there are four, all in the diocese of Rome—or minor basilicas, of which there were 1,810 worldwide . The Umbraculum is displayed in a basilica to the right side (i.e. the Epistle side) of the altar to indicate that the church has been awarded the rank of a basilica.

<text>A Cypherpunk [[anonymous remailer]], also known as a Type I remailer, is a type of anonymous remailer that receives messages encrypted with PGP or GPG, follows predetermined instructions to strip any identifying information, and forwards the messages to the desired recipient.

Cypherpunk anonymous remailers are vulnerable to traffic analysis attacks, which take advantage of the predictable order in which messages are sent to recipients. This predictability can potentially reveal the identity of the sender. To address this weakness, Type II and Type III remailers were developed. Prior to the introduction of Mixmaster (Type II) remailers, users attempted to mitigate this issue by sending messages in batches or by using multiple remailers in sequence to further obscure the sender&#x27;s identity.

Mixmaster remailers were built upon the technology of Cypherpunk remailers, rendering the latter . However, there are still websites and systems which rely on the general ideas of layered encryption and identity obfuscation behind Type I remailers.

== History ==
The Cypherpunk movement emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, consisting of activists, cryptographers, and computer scientists who believed in the use of cryptography as a means to safeguard privacy and resist government interference. They played a crucial role in the development of privacy technologies, including remailers.

==Uses==
While they are mostly considered obsolete due to the Mixmaster being the most common remailer type, Cypherpunk remailers are still applicable in niche applications for those who have no other accessible options. For example, sites that are censored or blocked by governments can use such remailers to circumvent this censorship. Cypherpunk remailers also require less setup and fewer resources to run, and can therefore be a suitable solution for those under time constraints or with few available assets.

==Notes==
* The additional headers used in this context are referred to as &quot;pseudo-headers&quot; because they are not included in the RFC 822 headers specification for email.
* Messages sent to Cypherpunk remailers can be layered, meaning they pass through multiple Cypherpunk remailers to minimize the chances of identifying the sender.
* Some Cypherpunk remailers also function as Mixmaster anonymous remailers, enabling them to divide long Cypherpunk messages into Mixmaster packets and forward them to the next remailer if it supports Mixmaster functionality.
* Many users of Cypherpunk remailers may choose to repeat steps 1–4 to add additional layers of protection to their messages, routing them through multiple remailers for enhanced privacy and security.

<text>In complexity theory, computational problems that are co-NP-complete are those that are the hardest problems in co-NP, in the sense that any problem in co-NP can be reformulated as a special case of any co-NP-complete problem with only polynomial overhead. If P is different from co-NP, then all of the co-NP-complete problems are not solvable in polynomial time. If there exists a way to solve a co-NP-complete problem quickly, then that algorithm can be used to solve all co-NP problems quickly.

Each co-NP-complete problem is the complement of an NP-complete problem. There are some problems in both NP and co-NP, for example all problems in P or integer factorization. However, it is not known if the sets are equal, although inequality is thought more likely. See co-NP and NP-complete for more details.

Fortune showed in 1979 that if any sparse language is co-NP-complete (or even just co-NP-hard), then , a critical foundation for Mahaney&#x27;s theorem.

==Formal definition==
A decision problem &quot;C&quot; is co-NP-complete if it is in co-NP and if every problem in co-NP is polynomial-time many-one reducible to it. This means that for every co-NP problem &quot;L&quot;, there exists a polynomial time algorithm which can transform any instance of &quot;L&quot; into an instance of &quot;C&quot; with the same truth value. As a consequence, if we had a polynomial time algorithm for &quot;C&quot;, we could solve all co-NP problems in polynomial time.

==Example==
One example of a co-NP-complete problem is tautology, the problem of determining whether a given Boolean formula is a tautology; that is, whether every possible assignment of true/false values to variables yields a true statement. This is closely related to the Boolean satisfiability problem, which asks whether there exists &quot;at least one&quot; such assignment, and is NP-complete.

<text>In computational complexity theory, a computational problem &quot;H&quot; is called NP-hard if, for every problem &quot;L&quot; which can be solved in non-deterministic polynomial-time, there is a polynomial-time reduction from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;H&quot;. That is, assuming a solution for &quot;H&quot; takes 1 unit time, &quot;H&quot;″s solution can be used to solve &quot;L&quot; in polynomial time. As a consequence, finding a polynomial time algorithm to solve a single NP-hard problem would give polynomial time algorithms for all the problems in the complexity class NP. As it is suspected, but unproven, that P≠NP, it is unlikely that any polynomial-time algorithms for NP-hard problems exist.

A simple example of an NP-hard problem is the subset sum problem.

Informally, if &quot;H&quot; is NP-hard, then it is at least as difficult to solve as the problems in NP. However, the opposite direction is not true: some problems are undecidable, and therefore even more difficult to solve than all problems in NP, but they are probably not NP-hard (unless P=NP).

== Definition ==
A decision problem &quot;H&quot; is NP-hard when for every problem &quot;L&quot; in NP, there is a polynomial-time many-one reduction from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;H&quot;.

Another definition is to require that there be a polynomial-time reduction from an NP-complete problem &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot;. As any problem &quot;L&quot; in NP reduces in polynomial time to &quot;G&quot;, &quot;L&quot; reduces in turn to &quot;H&quot; in polynomial time so this new definition implies the previous one. It does not restrict the class NP-hard to decision problems, and it also includes search problems or optimization problems.

== Consequences ==
If P ≠ NP, then NP-hard problems could not be solved in polynomial time.

Some NP-hard optimization problems can be polynomial-time approximated up to some constant approximation ratio (in particular, those in APX) or even up to any approximation ratio (those in PTAS or FPTAS). There are many classes of approximability, each one enabling approximation up to a different level. 

== Examples ==
All NP-complete problems are also NP-hard (see List of NP-complete problems). For example, the optimization problem of finding the least-cost cyclic route through all nodes of a weighted graph—commonly known as the travelling salesman problem—is NP-hard. The subset sum problem is another example: given a set of integers, does any non-empty subset of them add up to zero? That is a decision problem and happens to be NP-complete.

There are decision problems that are &quot;NP-hard&quot; but not &quot;NP-complete&quot; such as the halting problem. That is the problem which asks &quot;given a program and its input, will it run forever?&quot; That is a &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; question and so is a decision problem. It is easy to prove that the halting problem is NP-hard but not NP-complete. For example, the Boolean satisfiability problem can be reduced to the halting problem by transforming it to the description of a Turing machine that tries all truth value assignments and when it finds one that satisfies the formula it halts and otherwise it goes into an infinite loop. It is also easy to see that the halting problem is not in &quot;NP&quot; since all problems in NP are decidable in a finite number of operations, but the halting problem, in general, is undecidable. There are also NP-hard problems that are neither &quot;NP-complete&quot; nor &quot;Undecidable&quot;. For instance, the language of true quantified Boolean formulas is decidable in polynomial space, but not in non-deterministic polynomial time (unless NP = PSPACE).

== NP-naming convention ==
NP-hard problems do not have to be elements of the complexity class NP.
As NP plays a central role in computational complexity, it is used as the basis of several classes:
;NP: Class of computational decision problems for which any given &quot;yes&quot;-solution can be verified as a solution in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine (or &quot;solvable&quot; by a &quot;non-deterministic&quot; Turing machine in polynomial time).
;NP-hard: Class of problems which are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. Problems that are NP-hard do not have to be elements of NP; indeed, they may not even be decidable.
;NP-complete: Class of decision problems which contains the hardest problems in NP. Each NP-complete problem has to be in NP.
;NP-easy: At most as hard as NP, but not necessarily in NP.
;NP-equivalent: Decision problems that are both NP-hard and NP-easy, but not necessarily in NP.
;NP-intermediate: If P and NP are different, then there exist decision problems in the region of NP that fall between P and the NP-complete problems. (If P and NP are the same class, then NP-intermediate problems do not exist because in this case every NP-complete problem would fall in P, and by definition, every problem in NP can be reduced to an NP-complete problem.)

== Application areas ==
NP-hard problems are often tackled with rules-based languages in areas including:
* Approximate computing
* Configuration
* Cryptography
* Data mining
* Decision support
* Phylogenetics
* Planning
* Process monitoring and control
* Rosters or schedules
* Routing/vehicle routing
* Scheduling

== NP-hard problems ==
Problems that are decidable but not NP-complete, often are optimization problems:

* Knapsack Optimization Problems
* Integer Programming
* Travelling Salesman Optimization Problem
* Minimum Vertex Cover
* Maximum Clique
* Longest Simple Path
* Graph Coloring; an application: register allocation in compilers

<text>In computational complexity theory, a decision problem is P-complete (complete for the complexity class [[P-complete|P]]) if it is in P and every problem in P can be reduced to it by an appropriate reduction.

The notion of P-complete decision problems is useful in the analysis of:

* which problems are difficult to parallelize effectively,
* which problems are difficult to solve in limited space.

specifically when stronger notions of reducibility than polytime-reducibility are considered.

The specific type of reduction used varies and may affect the exact set of problems. Generically, reductions stronger than polynomial-time reductions are used, since all languages in P (except the empty language and the language of all strings) are P-complete under polynomial-time reductions. If we use [[NC (complexity)|NC]] reductions, that is, reductions which can operate in polylogarithmic time on a parallel computer with a polynomial number of processors, then all P-complete problems lie outside NC and so cannot be effectively parallelized, under the unproven assumption that NC ≠ P. If we use the stronger log-space reduction, this remains true, but additionally we learn that all P-complete problems lie outside L under the weaker unproven assumption that L ≠ P. In this latter case the set P-complete may be smaller.

== Motivation ==

The class P, typically taken to consist of all the &quot;tractable&quot; problems for a sequential computer, contains the class NC, which consists of those problems which can be efficiently solved on a parallel computer. This is because parallel computers can be simulated on a sequential machine. 
It is not known whether NC = P. In other words, it is not known whether there are any tractable problems that are inherently sequential. Just as it is widely suspected that P does not equal NP, so it is widely suspected that NC does not equal P.

Similarly, the class L contains all problems that can be solved by a sequential computer in logarithmic space. Such machines run in polynomial time because they can have a polynomial number of configurations. It is suspected that L ≠ P; that is, that some problems that can be solved in polynomial time also require more than logarithmic space.

Similarly to the use of NP-complete problems to analyze the P = NP question, the P-complete problems, viewed as the &quot;probably not parallelizable&quot; or &quot;probably inherently sequential&quot; problems, serves in a similar manner to study the NC = P question. Finding an efficient way to parallelize the solution to some P-complete problem would show that NC = P. It can also be thought of as the &quot;problems requiring superlogarithmic space&quot;; a log-space solution to a P-complete problem (using the definition based on log-space reductions) would imply L = P.

The logic behind this is analogous to the logic that a polynomial-time solution to an NP-complete problem would prove P = NP: if we have a NC reduction from any problem in P to a problem A, and an NC solution for A, then NC = P. Similarly, if we have a log-space reduction from any problem in P to a problem A, and a log-space solution for A, then L = P.

== P-complete problems ==

The most basic P-complete problem under logspace many-one reductions is following: given a Turing machine formula_1, an input for that machine x, and a number &quot;T&quot; (written in unary), formula_2 does that machine halt on that input within the first &quot;T&quot; steps? For any x in formula_3 in P, output the encoding of the Turing machine which accepts it in polynomial-time, the encoding of x itself, and a number of steps formula_4 corresponding to the p which is there polynomial-time bound on the operation of the Turing Machine formula_5 deciding formula_3, formula_7. The machine M halts on x within formula_8 steps if and only if x is in L. Clearly, if we can parallelize a general simulation of a sequential computer (ie. The Turing machine simulation of a Turing machine), then we will be able to parallelize any program that runs on that computer. If this problem is in NC, then so is every other problem in P. If the number of steps is written in binary, the problem is EXPTIME-complete.
This problem illustrates a common trick in the theory of P-completeness. We aren&#x27;t really interested in whether a problem can be solved quickly on a parallel machine. We&#x27;re just interested in whether a parallel machine solves it &quot;much more&quot; quickly than a sequential machine. Therefore, we have to reword the problem so that the sequential version is in P. That is why this problem required &quot;T&quot; to be written in unary. If a number &quot;T&quot; is written as a binary number (a string of &quot;n&quot; ones and zeros, where &quot;n&quot; = log &quot;T&quot;), then the obvious sequential algorithm can take time 2&quot;n&quot;. On the other hand, if &quot;T&quot; is written as a unary number (a string of &quot;n&quot; ones, where &quot;n&quot; = &quot;T&quot;), then it only takes time &quot;n&quot;. By writing &quot;T&quot; in unary rather than binary, we have reduced the obvious sequential algorithm from exponential time to linear time. That puts the sequential problem in P. Then, it will be in NC if and only if it is parallelizable.

Many other problems have been proved to be P-complete, and therefore are widely believed to be inherently sequential. These include the 
following problems which are P-complete under at least logspace reductions, either as given, or in a decision-problem form:
* Circuit Value Problem (CVP) – Given a circuit, the inputs to the circuit, and one gate in the circuit, calculate the output of that gate.
* Restricted Case of CVP – Like CVP, except each gate has two inputs and two outputs (F and Not F), every other layer is just AND gates, the rest are OR gates (or, equivalently, all gates are NAND gates, or all gates are NOR gates), the inputs of a gate come from the immediately preceding layer
* Linear programming – Maximize a linear function subject to linear inequality constraints
* Lexicographically First Depth First Search Ordering – Given a graph with fixed ordered adjacency lists, and nodes &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, is vertex &quot;u&quot; visited before vertex &quot;v&quot; in a depth-first search induced by the order of the adjacency lists?
* Context Free Grammar Membership – Given a context-free grammar and a string, can that string be generated by that grammar?
* Horn-satisfiability – given a set of Horn clauses, is there a variable assignment which satisfies them? This is P&#x27;s version of the boolean satisfiability problem.
* Game of Life – Given an initial configuration of Conway&#x27;s Game of Life, a particular cell, and a time &quot;T&quot; (in unary), is that cell alive after &quot;T&quot; steps?
* LZW (algorithm) (1978 paradigm) Data Compression – given strings &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, will compressing &quot;s&quot; with an LZ78 method add &quot;t&quot; to the dictionary? (Note that for LZ77 compression such as gzip, this is much easier, as the problem reduces to &quot;Is &quot;t&quot; in &quot;s&quot;?&quot;.)
* Type inference for partial types – Given an untyped term from the lambda calculus, determine whether this term has a partial type.

Most of the languages above are P-complete under even stronger notions of reduction, such as uniform formula_9 many-one reductions, DLOGTIME reductions, or polylogarithmic projections.

In order to prove that a given problem in P is P-complete, one typically tries to reduce a known P-complete problem to the given one.

In 1999, Jin-Yi Cai and D. Sivakumar, building on work by Ogihara, showed that if there exists a sparse language that is P-complete, then L = P.

P-complete problems may be solvable with different time complexities. For instance, the Circuit Value Problem can be solved in linear time by a topological sort. Of course, because the reductions to a P-complete problem may have different time complexities, this fact does not imply that all the problems in P can also be solved in linear time.

<text>In computational complexity theory, a decision problem is PSPACE-complete if it can be solved using an amount of memory that is polynomial in the input length (polynomial space) and if every other problem that can be solved in polynomial space can be transformed to it in polynomial time. The problems that are PSPACE-complete can be thought of as the hardest problems in PSPACE, the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial space, because a solution to any one such problem could easily be used to solve any other problem in PSPACE.

Problems known to be PSPACE-complete include determining properties of regular expressions and context-sensitive grammars, determining the truth of quantified Boolean formulas, step-by-step changes between solutions of combinatorial optimization problems, and many puzzles and games.

==Theory==
A problem is defined to be PSPACE-complete if it can be solved using a polynomial amount of memory (it belongs to PSPACE) and every problem in PSPACE can be transformed in polynomial time into an equivalent instance of the given problem.

The PSPACE-complete problems are widely suspected to be outside the more famous complexity classes P (polynomial time) and NP (non-deterministic polynomial time), but that is not known. It is known that they lie outside of the class NC, a class of problems with highly efficient parallel algorithms, because problems in NC can be solved in an amount of space polynomial in the logarithm of the input size, and the class of problems solvable in such a small amount of space is strictly contained in PSPACE by the space hierarchy theorem.

The transformations that are usually considered in defining PSPACE-completeness are polynomial-time many-one reductions, transformations that take a single instance of a problem of one type into an equivalent single instance of a problem of a different type. However, it is also possible to define completeness using Turing reductions, in which one problem can be solved in a polynomial number of calls to a subroutine for the other problem. It is not known whether these two types of reductions lead to different classes of PSPACE-complete problems. Other types of reductions, such as many-one reductions that always increase the length of the transformed input, have also been considered.

A version of the Berman–Hartmanis conjecture for PSPACE-complete sets states that all such sets look alike, in the sense that they can all be transformed into each other by polynomial-time bijections.

==Examples==
===Formal languages===
Given a regular expression formula_1, determining whether it generates every string over its alphabet is PSPACE-complete.

The first known PSPACE-complete problem was the word problem for deterministic context-sensitive grammars. In the word problem for context-sensitive grammars, one is given a set of grammatical transformations which can increase, but cannot decrease, the length of a sentence, and wishes to determine if a given sentence could be produced by these transformations. The technical condition of &quot;determinism&quot; (implying roughly that each transformation makes it obvious that it was used) ensures that this process can be solved in polynomial space, and showed that every (possibly non-deterministic) program computable in linear space could be converted into the parsing of a context-sensitive grammar, in a way which preserves determinism. In 1970, Savitch&#x27;s theorem showed that PSPACE is closed under nondeterminism, implying that even non-deterministic context-sensitive grammars are in PSPACE.

===Logic===
A standard PSPACE-complete problem, used in many other PSPACE-completeness results, is the quantified Boolean formula problem, a generalization of the Boolean satisfiability problem. The quantified Boolean formula problem takes as input a Boolean expression, with all of its variables quantified either universally or existentially, for example:
formula_2
The output of the problem is the value of the quantified expression. Finding this value is PSPACE-complete.

===Reconfiguration===
Reconfiguration problems concern the connectivity of a state space of solutions to a combinatorial problem. For instance, testing whether two 4-colorings of a graph can be connected to each other by moves that change the color of one vertex at a time, maintaining at each step a valid 4-coloring, is PSPACE-complete, even though the same problem for 3-colorings can be solved in polynomial time. Another family of reconfiguration problems, used similarly to quantified Boolean formulas as the basis for PSPACE-completeness proofs of many other problems in this area, involve nondeterministic constraint logic, in which the states are orientations of a constraint graph subject to certain constraints on how many edges must be oriented inwards at each vertex, and in which the moves from state to state reverse the orientation of a single edge.

===Puzzles and games===

The quantified Boolean formula problem can be interpreted as a game by two players, a verifier and a falsifier. The players make moves that fill in values for the quantified variables, in the order they are nested, with the verifier filling in existentially quantified variables and the falsifier filling in universally quantified variables; the game is won by the verifier if the filled-in formula becomes true, and by the falsifier otherwise. A quantified formula is true if and only if the verifier has a winning strategy. Similarly, the problem of determining the winner or loser of many other combinatorial games turns out to be PSPACE-complete. Examples of games that are PSPACE-complete (when generalized so that they can be played on an formula_3 board) are the games Hex and Reversi. Some other generalized games, such as chess, checkers (draughts), and Go are EXPTIME-complete because a game between two perfect players can be very long, so they are unlikely to be in PSPACE. But they will become PSPACE-complete if a polynomial bound on the number of moves is enforced.

It is also possible for puzzles played by a single player to be PSPACE-complete. These often can be interpreted as reconfiguration problems, and include the solitaire games Rush Hour, Mahjong, Atomix and Sokoban, and the mechanical computer Turing Tumble.

PSPACE-completeness is based on complexity as a function of the input size formula_4, in the limit as formula_4 grows without bound. Puzzles or games with a bounded number of positions such as chess on a conventional formula_6 board cannot be PSPACE-complete, because they could be solved in constant time and space using a very large lookup table. To formulate PSPACE-complete versions of these games, they must be modified in a way that makes their number of positions unbounded, such as by playing them on an formula_3 board instead. In some cases, such as for chess, these extensions are artificial.

<text>In complexity theory, the complexity class NP-easy is the set of function problems that are solvable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine with an oracle for some decision problem in NP.

In other words, a problem X is NP-easy if and only if there exists some problem Y in NP such that X is polynomial-time Turing reducible to Y. This means that given an oracle for Y, there exists an algorithm that solves X in polynomial time (possibly by repeatedly using that oracle).

NP-easy is another name for FPNP (see the function problem article) or for FΔ2P (see the polynomial hierarchy article).

An example of an NP-easy problem is the problem of sorting a list of strings. The decision problem &quot;is string A greater than string B&quot; is in NP. There are algorithms such as quicksort that can sort the list using only a polynomial number of calls to the comparison routine, plus a polynomial amount of additional work. Therefore, sorting is NP-easy.

There are also more difficult problems that are NP-easy. See NP-equivalent for an example.

The definition of NP-easy uses a Turing reduction rather than a many-one reduction because the answers to problem &quot;Y&quot; are only TRUE or FALSE, but the answers to problem &quot;X&quot; can be more general. Therefore, there is no general way to translate an instance of &quot;X&quot; to an instance of &quot;Y&quot; with the same answer.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the complexity class NP-equivalent is the set of function problems that are both NP-easy and NP-hard. NP-equivalent is the analogue of NP-complete for function problems.

For example, the problem FIND-SUBSET-SUM is in NP-equivalent. Given a set of integers, FIND-SUBSET-SUM is the problem of finding some nonempty subset of the integers that adds up to zero (or returning the empty set if there is no such subset). This optimization problem is similar to the decision problem SUBSET-SUM. Given a set of integers, SUBSET-SUM is the problem of finding whether there exists a subset summing to zero. SUBSET-SUM is NP-complete.

To show that FIND-SUBSET-SUM is NP-equivalent, we must show that it is both NP-hard and NP-easy.

Clearly it is NP-hard. If we had a black box that solved FIND-SUBSET-SUM in unit time, then it would be easy to solve SUBSET-SUM. Simply ask the black box to find the subset that sums to zero, then check whether it returned a nonempty set.

It is also NP-easy. If we had a black box that solved SUBSET-SUM in unit time, then we could use it to solve FIND-SUBSET-SUM. If it returns &quot;false&quot;, we immediately return the empty set. Otherwise, we visit each element in order and remove it provided that SUBSET-SUM would still return &quot;true&quot; after we remove it. Once we&#x27;ve visited every element, we will no longer be able to remove any element without changing the answer from &quot;true&quot; to &quot;false&quot;; at this point the remaining subset of the original elements must sum to zero. This requires us to note that later removals of elements do not alter the fact that removal of an earlier element changed the answer from &quot;true&quot; to &quot;false&quot;. In pseudocode:

 function FIND-SUBSET-SUM(&quot;set&quot; S)
 if not(SUBSET-SUM(S))
 return {}
 for each x in S
 if SUBSET-SUM(S – {x})
 S := S – {x}
 return S

Another well-known NP-equivalent problem is the traveling salesman problem.

==Clarification==

In this context &quot;NP&quot; stands for &quot;nondeterministic polynomial time&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
There are also NP-equivalence classes of Boolean functions, where &quot;NP&quot; stands for &quot;negation&quot; and &quot;permutation&quot;.

<doc id="54691" wikidata="Q1227430" url="?curid=54691" title="Direct-access storage device">
<text>A direct-access storage device (DASD) (pronounced ) is a secondary storage device in which &quot;each physical record has a discrete location and a unique address&quot;. The term was coined by IBM to describe devices that allowed random access to data, the main examples being drum memory and hard disk drives. Later, optical disc drives and flash memory units are also classified as DASD.

The term DASD contrasts with sequential access storage device such as a magnetic tape drive, and unit record equipment such as a punched card device. A record on a DASD can be accessed without having to read through intervening records from the current location, whereas reading anything other than the &quot;next&quot; record on tape or deck of cards requires skipping over intervening records, and requires a proportionally long time to access a distant point in a medium. Access methods for DASD include sequential, partitioned, indexed, and direct. 

The DASD storage class includes both fixed and removable media.

==Architecture==
IBM mainframes access I/O devices including DASD through &quot;channels&quot;, a type of subordinate mini-processor. &quot;Channel programs&quot; write to, read from, and control the given device.

===CTR (CHR)===
The operating system uses a four byte relative track and record (TTR) for some access methods and for others an eight-byte extent-bin-cylinder-track-record block address, or MBBCCHHR, Channel programs address DASD using a six byte seek address (BBCCHH) and a five byte record identifier (CCHHR). 
*M represents the extent number within the allocation
*BB representing the Bin (from 2321 data cells), 
*CC representing the Cylinder, 
*HH representing the Head (or track), and 
*R representing the Record (block) number. 
When the 2321 data cell was discontinued in January 1975, the addressing scheme and the device itself was referred to as CHR or CTR for cylinder-track-record, as the bin number was always 0.

IBM refers to the data records programmers work with as &quot;logical records&quot;, and the format on DASD as blocks or &quot;physical records&quot;. One block might contain several logical (or user) records or, in some schemes, called &quot;spanned records&quot;, partial logical records.

Physical records can have any size up to the limit of a track, but some devices have a track overflow feature that allows breaking a large block into track-size segments within the same cylinder.

The queued access methods, such as QSAM, are responsible for &quot;blocking&quot; and &quot;deblocking&quot; logical records as they are written to or read from external media. The basic access methods, such as BSAM, require the user program to do it. 

====CKD====

CKD is an acronym for Count Key Data, the physical layout of a block on a DASD device, and should not be confused with BBCCH and CCHHR, which are the addresses used by the channel program. CTR in this context may refer to either type of address, depending on the channel command. 

===FBA===
In 1979 IBM introduced fixed-block architecture (FBA) for mainframes. At the programming level, these devices do not use the traditional CHR addressing, but reference fixed-length blocks by number, much like sectors in mini-computers. More correctly, the application programmer remains unaware of the underlying storage arrangement, which stores the data in fixed physical block lengths of 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096, depending on the device type. As part of the FBA interface IBM introduced new channel commands for asynchronous operation that are very similar to those introduced for ECKD.
For some applications, FBA not only offers simplicity, but an increase in throughput.

FBA is supported by VM/370 and DOS/VSE, but not MVS or successor operating systems in the OS/360 line.

===FCP attached SCSI===
Processors with FICON channels can access SCSI drives using Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP). While z/VM and z/VSE fully support FCP, z/OS provides only limited support through IOSFBA.

==Access==

Some programming interface macros and routines are collectively referred to as &quot;access methods&quot; with names ending in Access Method.

===DOS/360 and successors===
DOS/360 through z/VSE support datasets on DASD with the following access methods: 
* Logical IOCS (LIOCS)
** sequential access method (SAM)
** direct access method (DAM)
** indexed sequential access method (ISAM)
** virtual storage access method (VSAM)
* Physical IOCS (PIOCS)
** Execute channel program (EXCP)

===OS/360 and successors===
OS/360 through z/OS support datasets on DASD with the following access methods: 
* Basic sequential access method (BSAM)
* Basic indexed sequential access method (BISAM)
* Queued sequential access method (QSAM)
* Queued indexed sequential access method (QISAM)
* Basic partitioned access method (BPAM)
* Basic direct access method (BDAM)
* Virtual storage access method (VSAM)
* Execute Channel Program (EXCP)
* Execute Channel Program in Real Storage (EXCPVR)

In MVS, starting with OS/VS2 Release 2 and continuing through z/OS, all of the access methods including EXCP[VR], use the privileged STARTIO macro.

==Terminology==
IBM in its 1964 first version of the &quot;IBM System/360 System Summary&quot; used the term &quot;File&quot; to collectively described devices now called DASD. Files provided &quot;random access storage&#x27;&quot; At the same time IBM&#x27;s product reference manual described such devices as &quot;direct access storage devices&quot; without any acronym.

An early public use of the acronym DASD is in IBM&#x27;s March 1966 manual, &quot;Data File Handbook.&quot; The earliest non-IBM use of the acronym DASD found by the &quot;Google ngram viewer&quot; to refer to storage devices dates from 1968. From then on use of the term grew exponentially until 1990 after which its usage declined substantially.

Both drums and data cells have disappeared as products, so DASD remains as a synonym of disk, flash and optical devices. Modern DASD used in mainframes only very rarely consist of single disk-drives. Most commonly &quot;DASD&quot; means large disk arrays utilizing RAID schemes. Current devices emulate CKD on FBA hardware.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the complexity class EXPTIME (sometimes called EXP or DEXPTIME) is the set of all decision problems that are solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in exponential time, i.e., in O(2&quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) time, where &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is a polynomial function of &quot;n&quot;.

EXPTIME is one intuitive class in an exponential hierarchy of complexity classes with increasingly more complex oracles or quantifier alternations. For example, the class 2-EXPTIME is defined similarly to EXPTIME but with a doubly exponential time bound. This can be generalized to higher and higher time bounds.

EXPTIME can also be reformulated as the space class APSPACE, the set of all problems that can be solved by an alternating Turing machine in polynomial space.
EXPTIME relates to the other basic time and space complexity classes in the following way: P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ EXPTIME ⊆ NEXPTIME ⊆ EXPSPACE. Furthermore, by the time hierarchy theorem and the space hierarchy theorem, it is known that P ⊊ EXPTIME, NP ⊊ NEXPTIME and PSPACE ⊊ EXPSPACE.

== Formal definition ==
In terms of DTIME,

== Relationships to other classes ==
It is known that

and also, by the time hierarchy theorem and the space hierarchy theorem, that

In the above expressions, the symbol ⊆ means &quot;is a subset of&quot;, and the symbol ⊊ means &quot;is a strict subset of&quot;.

so at least one of the first three inclusions and at least one of the last three inclusions must be proper, but it is not known which ones are. It is also known that if P = NP, then EXPTIME NEXPTIME, the class of problems solvable in exponential time by a nondeterministic Turing machine. More precisely, E ≠ NE if and only if there exist sparse languages in NP that are not in P.

EXPTIME can be reformulated as the space class APSPACE, the set of all problems that can be solved by an alternating Turing machine in polynomial space. This is one way to see that PSPACE ⊆ EXPTIME, since an alternating Turing machine is at least as powerful as a deterministic Turing machine.

==EXPTIME-complete==
A decision problem is EXPTIME-complete if it is in EXPTIME and every problem in EXPTIME has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to it. In other words, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that transforms instances of one to instances of the other with the same answer. Problems that are EXPTIME-complete might be thought of as the hardest problems in EXPTIME. Notice that although it is unknown whether NP is equal to P, we do know that EXPTIME-complete problems are not in P; it has been proven that these problems cannot be solved in polynomial time, by the time hierarchy theorem.

In computability theory, one of the basic undecidable problems is the halting problem: deciding whether a deterministic Turing machine (DTM) halts. One of the most fundamental EXPTIME-complete problems is a simpler version of this, which asks if a DTM halts on a given input in at most &quot;k&quot; steps. It is in EXPTIME because a trivial simulation requires O(&quot;k&quot;) time, and the input &quot;k&quot; is encoded using O(log &quot;k&quot;) bits which causes exponential number of simulations. It is EXPTIME-complete because, roughly speaking, we can use it to determine if a machine solving an EXPTIME problem accepts in an exponential number of steps; it will not use more. The same problem with the number of steps written in unary is P-complete.

Other examples of EXPTIME-complete problems include the problem of evaluating a position in generalized chess, checkers, or Go (with Japanese ko rules). These games have a chance of being EXPTIME-complete because games can last for a number of moves that is exponential in the size of the board. In the Go example, the Japanese ko rule is known to imply EXPTIME-completeness, but it is not known if the American or Chinese rules for the game are EXPTIME-complete (they could range from PSPACE to EXPSPACE).

By contrast, generalized games that can last for a number of moves that is polynomial in the size of the board are often PSPACE-complete. The same is true of exponentially long games in which non-repetition is automatic.

Another set of important EXPTIME-complete problems relates to succinct circuits. Succinct circuits are simple machines used to describe some graphs in exponentially less space. They accept two vertex numbers as input and output whether there is an edge between them. For many natural P-complete graph problems, where the graph is expressed in a natural representation such as an adjacency matrix, solving the same problem on a succinct circuit representation is EXPTIME-complete, because the input is exponentially smaller; but this requires nontrivial proof, since succinct circuits can only describe a subclass of graphs.

<doc id="54695" wikidata="Q179299" url="?curid=54695" title="RAID">
<text>RAID (; redundant array of inexpensive disks or redundant array of independent disks) is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical data storage components into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both. This is in contrast to the previous concept of highly reliable mainframe disk drives known as &quot;single large expensive disk&quot; (&quot;SLED&quot;).

Data is distributed across the drives in one of several ways, referred to as RAID levels, depending on the required level of redundancy and performance. The different schemes, or data distribution layouts, are named by the word &quot;RAID&quot; followed by a number, for example RAID 0 or RAID 1. Each scheme, or RAID level, provides a different balance among the key goals: reliability, availability, performance, and capacity. RAID levels greater than RAID 0 provide protection against unrecoverable sector read errors, as well as against failures of whole physical drives.

== History ==
The term &quot;RAID&quot; was invented by David Patterson, Garth Gibson, and Randy Katz at the University of California, Berkeley in 1987. In their June 1988 paper &quot;A Case for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)&quot;, presented at the SIGMOD Conference, they argued that the top-performing mainframe disk drives of the time could be beaten on performance by an array of the inexpensive drives that had been developed for the growing personal computer market. Although failures would rise in proportion to the number of drives, by configuring for redundancy, the reliability of an array could far exceed that of any large single drive.

Although not yet using that terminology, the technologies of the five levels of RAID named in the June 1988 paper were used in various products prior to the paper&#x27;s publication, including the following:

* Mirroring (RAID 1) was well established in the 1970s including, for example, Tandem NonStop Systems.
* In 1977, Norman Ken Ouchi at IBM filed a patent disclosing what was subsequently named RAID 4.
* Around 1983, DEC began shipping subsystem mirrored RA8X disk drives (now known as RAID 1) as part of its HSC50 subsystem.
* In 1986, Clark et al. at IBM filed a patent disclosing what was subsequently named RAID 5.
* Around 1988, the Thinking Machines&#x27; DataVault used error correction codes (now known as RAID 2) in an array of disk drives. A similar approach was used in the early 1960s on the IBM 353.

Industry manufacturers later redefined the RAID acronym to stand for &quot;redundant array of &quot;independent&quot; disks&quot;.

== Overview ==
Many RAID levels employ an error protection scheme called &quot;parity&quot;, a widely used method in information technology to provide fault tolerance in a given set of data. Most use simple XOR, but RAID 6 uses two separate parities based respectively on addition and multiplication in a particular Galois field or Reed–Solomon error correction.

RAID can also provide data security with solid-state drives (SSDs) without the expense of an all-SSD system. For example, a fast SSD can be mirrored with a mechanical drive. For this configuration to provide a significant speed advantage, an appropriate controller is needed that uses the fast SSD for all read operations. Adaptec calls this &quot;hybrid RAID&quot;.

== Standard levels ==

Originally, there were five standard levels of RAID, but many variations have evolved, including several nested levels and many non-standard levels (mostly proprietary). RAID levels and their associated data formats are standardized by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) in the Common RAID Disk Drive Format (DDF) standard:

* RAID 0 consists of block-level striping, but no mirroring or parity. Assuming &quot;n&quot; fully-used drives of equal capacity, the capacity of a RAID 0 volume matches that of a spanned volume: the total of the &quot;n&quot; drives&#x27; capacities. However, because striping distributes the contents of each file across all drives, the failure of any drive renders the entire RAID 0 volume inaccessible. Typically, all data is lost, and files cannot be recovered without a backup copy.
: By contrast, a spanned volume, which stores files sequentially, loses data stored on the failed drive but preserves data stored on the remaining drives. However, recovering the files after drive failure can be challenging and often depends on the specifics of the filesystem. Regardless, files that span onto or off a failed drive will be permanently lost.
: On the other hand, the benefit of RAID 0 is that the throughput of read and write operations to any file is multiplied by the number of drives because, unlike spanned volumes, reads and writes are performed concurrently. The cost is increased vulnerability to drive failures—since any drive in a RAID 0 setup failing causes the entire volume to be lost, the average failure rate of the volume rises with the number of attached drives. This makes RAID 0 a poor choice for scenarios requiring data reliability or fault tolerance.
* RAID 1 consists of data mirroring, without parity or striping. Data is written identically to two or more drives, thereby producing a &quot;mirrored set&quot; of drives. Thus, any read request can be serviced by any drive in the set. If a request is broadcast to every drive in the set, it can be serviced by the drive that accesses the data first (depending on its seek time and rotational latency), improving performance. Sustained read throughput, if the controller or software is optimized for it, approaches the sum of throughputs of every drive in the set, just as for RAID 0. Actual read throughput of most RAID 1 implementations is slower than the fastest drive. Write throughput is always slower because every drive must be updated, and the slowest drive limits the write performance. The array continues to operate as long as at least one drive is functioning.
* RAID 2 consists of bit-level striping with dedicated Hamming-code parity. All disk spindle rotation is synchronized and data is striped such that each sequential bit is on a different drive. Hamming-code parity is calculated across corresponding bits and stored on at least one parity drive. This level is of historical significance only; although it was used on some early machines (for example, the Thinking Machines CM-2), it is not used by any commercially available system.
* RAID 3 consists of byte-level striping with dedicated parity. All disk spindle rotation is synchronized and data is striped such that each sequential byte is on a different drive. Parity is calculated across corresponding bytes and stored on a dedicated parity drive. Although implementations exist, RAID 3 is not commonly used in practice.
* RAID 4 consists of block-level striping with dedicated parity. This level was previously used by NetApp, but has now been largely replaced by a proprietary implementation of RAID 4 with two parity disks, called RAID-DP. The main advantage of RAID 4 over RAID 2 and 3 is I/O parallelism: in RAID 2 and 3, a single read I/O operation requires reading the whole group of data drives, while in RAID 4 one I/O read operation does not have to spread across all data drives. As a result, more I/O operations can be executed in parallel, improving the performance of small transfers.
* RAID 5 consists of block-level striping with distributed parity. Unlike RAID 4, parity information is distributed among the drives, requiring all drives but one to be present to operate. Upon failure of a single drive, subsequent reads can be calculated from the distributed parity such that no data is lost. RAID 5 requires at least three disks. Like all single-parity concepts, large RAID 5 implementations are susceptible to system failures because of trends regarding array rebuild time and the chance of drive failure during rebuild (see &quot;Increasing rebuild time and failure probability&quot; section, below). Rebuilding an array requires reading all data from all disks, opening a chance for a second drive failure and the loss of the entire array.
* RAID 6 consists of block-level striping with double distributed parity. Double parity provides fault tolerance up to two failed drives. This makes larger RAID groups more practical, especially for high-availability systems, as large-capacity drives take longer to restore. RAID 6 requires a minimum of four disks. As with RAID 5, a single drive failure results in reduced performance of the entire array until the failed drive has been replaced. With a RAID 6 array, using drives from multiple sources and manufacturers, it is possible to mitigate most of the problems associated with RAID 5. The larger the drive capacities and the larger the array size, the more important it becomes to choose RAID 6 instead of RAID 5. RAID 10 also minimizes these problems.

== Nested (hybrid) RAID ==
In what was originally termed &quot;hybrid RAID&quot;, many storage controllers allow RAID levels to be nested. The elements of a &quot;RAID&quot; may be either individual drives or arrays themselves. Arrays are rarely nested more than one level deep.

The final array is known as the top array. When the top array is RAID 0 (such as in RAID 1+0 and RAID 5+0), most vendors omit the &quot;+&quot; (yielding RAID 10 and RAID 50, respectively).

* RAID 0+1: creates two stripes and mirrors them. If a single drive failure occurs then one of the mirrors has failed, at this point it is running effectively as RAID 0 with no redundancy. Significantly higher risk is introduced during a rebuild than RAID 1+0 as all the data from all the drives in the remaining stripe has to be read rather than just from one drive, increasing the chance of an unrecoverable read error (URE) and significantly extending the rebuild window.
* RAID 1+0: (see: RAID 10) creates a striped set from a series of mirrored drives. The array can sustain multiple drive losses so long as no mirror loses all its drives.
* JBOD RAID N+N: With JBOD (&quot;just a bunch of disks&quot;), it is possible to concatenate disks, but also volumes such as RAID sets. With larger drive capacities, write delay and rebuilding time increase dramatically (especially, as described above, with RAID 5 and RAID 6). By splitting a larger RAID N set into smaller subsets and concatenating them with linear JBOD, write and rebuilding time will be reduced. If a hardware RAID controller is not capable of nesting linear JBOD with RAID N, then linear JBOD can be achieved with OS-level software RAID in combination with separate RAID N subset volumes created within one, or more, hardware RAID controller(s). Besides a drastic speed increase, this also provides a substantial advantage: the possibility to start a linear JBOD with a small set of disks and to be able to expand the total set with disks of different size, later on (in time, disks of bigger size become available on the market). There is another advantage in the form of disaster recovery (if a RAID N subset happens to fail, then the data on the other RAID N subsets is not lost, reducing restore time). 

== Non-standard levels ==
Many configurations other than the basic numbered RAID levels are possible, and many companies, organizations, and groups have created their own non-standard configurations, in many cases designed to meet the specialized needs of a small niche group. Such configurations include the following:

* Linux MD RAID 10 provides a general RAID driver that in its &quot;near&quot; layout defaults to a standard RAID 1 with two drives, and a standard RAID 1+0 with four drives; however, it can include any number of drives, including odd numbers. With its &quot;far&quot; layout, MD RAID 10 can run both striped and mirrored, even with only two drives in codice_1 layout; this runs mirroring with striped reads, giving the read performance of RAID 0. Regular RAID 1, as provided by Linux software RAID, does not stripe reads, but can perform reads in parallel.
* Hadoop has a RAID system that generates a parity file by xor-ing a stripe of blocks in a single HDFS file.
* BeeGFS, the parallel file system, has internal striping (comparable to file-based RAID0) and replication (comparable to file-based RAID10) options to aggregate throughput and capacity of multiple servers and is typically based on top of an underlying RAID to make disk failures transparent.
* Declustered RAID scatters dual (or more) copies of the data across all disks (possibly hundreds) in a storage subsystem, while holding back enough spare capacity to allow for a few disks to fail. The scattering is based on algorithms which give the appearance of arbitrariness. When one or more disks fail the missing copies are rebuilt into that spare capacity, again arbitrarily. Because the rebuild is done from and to all the remaining disks, it operates much faster than with traditional RAID, reducing the overall impact on clients of the storage system.

== Implementations ==
The distribution of data across multiple drives can be managed either by dedicated computer hardware or by software. A software solution may be part of the operating system, part of the firmware and drivers supplied with a standard drive controller (so-called &quot;hardware-assisted software RAID&quot;), or it may reside entirely within the hardware RAID controller.

=== Hardware-based ===
Hardware RAID controllers can be configured through card BIOS or Option ROM before an operating system is booted, and after the operating system is booted, proprietary configuration utilities are available from the manufacturer of each controller. Unlike the network interface controllers for Ethernet, which can usually be configured and serviced entirely through the common operating system paradigms like ifconfig in Unix, without a need for any third-party tools, each manufacturer of each RAID controller usually provides their own proprietary software tooling for each operating system that they deem to support, ensuring a vendor lock-in, and contributing to reliability issues.

For example, in FreeBSD, in order to access the configuration of Adaptec RAID controllers, users are required to enable Linux compatibility layer, and use the Linux tooling from Adaptec, potentially compromising the stability, reliability and security of their setup, especially when taking the long-term view.

Some other operating systems have implemented their own generic frameworks for interfacing with any RAID controller, and provide tools for monitoring RAID volume status, as well as facilitation of drive identification through LED blinking, alarm management and hot spare disk designations from within the operating system without having to reboot into card BIOS. For example, this was the approach taken by OpenBSD in 2005 with its bio(4) pseudo-device and the bioctl utility, which provide volume status, and allow LED/alarm/hotspare control, as well as the sensors (including the drive sensor) for health monitoring; this approach has subsequently been adopted and extended by NetBSD in 2007 as well.

===Software-based===
Software RAID implementations are provided by many modern operating systems. Software RAID can be implemented as:

* A layer that abstracts multiple devices, thereby providing a single virtual device (such as Linux kernel&#x27;s md and OpenBSD&#x27;s softraid)
* A more generic logical volume manager (provided with most server-class operating systems such as Veritas or LVM)
* A component of the file system (such as ZFS, Spectrum Scale or Btrfs)
* A layer that sits above any file system and provides parity protection to user data (such as RAID-F)

Some advanced file systems are designed to organize data across multiple storage devices directly, without needing the help of a third-party logical volume manager:

* ZFS supports the equivalents of RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5 (RAID-Z1) single-parity, RAID 6 (RAID-Z2) double-parity, and a triple-parity version (RAID-Z3) also referred to as RAID 7. As it always stripes over top-level vdevs, it supports equivalents of the 1+0, 5+0, and 6+0 nested RAID levels (as well as striped triple-parity sets) but not other nested combinations. ZFS is the native file system on Solaris and illumos, and is also available on FreeBSD and Linux. Open-source ZFS implementations are actively developed under the OpenZFS umbrella project.
* Spectrum Scale, initially developed by IBM for media streaming and scalable analytics, supports declustered RAID protection schemes up to n+3. A particularity is the dynamic rebuilding priority which runs with low impact in the background until a data chunk hits n+0 redundancy, in which case this chunk is quickly rebuilt to at least n+1. On top, Spectrum Scale supports metro-distance RAID 1.
* Btrfs supports RAID 0, RAID 1 and RAID 10 (RAID 5 and 6 are under development).
* XFS was originally designed to provide an integrated volume manager that supports concatenating, mirroring and striping of multiple physical storage devices. However, the implementation of XFS in Linux kernel lacks the integrated volume manager.

Many operating systems provide RAID implementations, including the following:

* Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s OpenVMS operating system supports RAID 1. The mirrored disks, called a &quot;shadow set&quot;, can be in different locations to assist in disaster recovery.
* Apple&#x27;s macOS and macOS Server natively support RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 1+0, which can be created with Disk Utility or its command-line interface, while RAID 4 and RAID 5 can only be created using the third-party software &quot;SoftRAID&quot; by OWC, with the driver for SoftRAID access natively included since macOS 13.3.
* FreeBSD supports RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 3, and RAID 5, and all nestings via GEOM modules and ccd.
* Linux&#x27;s md supports RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 4, RAID 5, RAID 6, and all nestings. Certain reshaping/resizing/expanding operations are also supported.
* Microsoft Windows supports RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 5 using various software implementations. Logical Disk Manager, introduced with Windows 2000, allows for the creation of RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 5 volumes by using dynamic disks, but this was limited only to professional and server editions of Windows until the release of Windows 8. Windows XP can be modified to unlock support for RAID 0, 1, and 5. Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 introduced a RAID-like feature known as Storage Spaces, which also allows users to specify mirroring, parity, or no redundancy on a folder-by-folder basis. These options are similar to RAID 1 and RAID 5, but are implemented at a higher abstraction level.
* NetBSD supports RAID 0, 1, 4, and 5 via its software implementation, named RAIDframe.
* OpenBSD supports RAID 0, 1 and 5 via its software implementation, named softraid.

If a boot drive fails, the system has to be sophisticated enough to be able to boot from the remaining drive or drives. For instance, consider a computer whose disk is configured as RAID 1 (mirrored drives); if the first drive in the array fails, then a first-stage boot loader might not be sophisticated enough to attempt loading the second-stage boot loader from the second drive as a fallback. The second-stage boot loader for FreeBSD is capable of loading a kernel from such an array.

=== Firmware- and driver-based ===

Software-implemented RAID is not always compatible with the system&#x27;s boot process, and it is generally impractical for desktop versions of Windows. However, hardware RAID controllers are expensive and proprietary. To fill this gap, inexpensive &quot;RAID controllers&quot; were introduced that do not contain a dedicated RAID controller chip, but simply a standard drive controller chip, or the chipset built-in RAID function, with proprietary firmware and drivers. During early bootup, the RAID is implemented by the firmware and, once the operating system has been more completely loaded, the drivers take over control. Consequently, such controllers may not work when driver support is not available for the host operating system. An example is Intel Rapid Storage Technology, implemented on many consumer-level motherboards.

Because some minimal hardware support is involved, this implementation is also called &quot;hardware-assisted software RAID&quot;, &quot;hybrid model&quot; RAID, or even &quot;fake RAID&quot;. If RAID 5 is supported, the hardware may provide a hardware XOR accelerator. An advantage of this model over the pure software RAID is that—if using a redundancy mode—the boot drive is protected from failure (due to the firmware) during the boot process even before the operating system&#x27;s drivers take over.

== Integrity ==
Data scrubbing (referred to in some environments as &quot;patrol read&quot;) involves periodic reading and checking by the RAID controller of all the blocks in an array, including those not otherwise accessed. This detects bad blocks before use. Data scrubbing checks for bad blocks on each storage device in an array, but also uses the redundancy of the array to recover bad blocks on a single drive and to reassign the recovered data to spare blocks elsewhere on the drive.

Frequently, a RAID controller is configured to &quot;drop&quot; a component drive (that is, to assume a component drive has failed) if the drive has been unresponsive for eight seconds or so; this might cause the array controller to drop a good drive because that drive has not been given enough time to complete its internal error recovery procedure. Consequently, using consumer-marketed drives with RAID can be risky, and so-called &quot;enterprise class&quot; drives limit this error recovery time to reduce risk. Western Digital&#x27;s desktop drives used to have a specific fix. A utility called WDTLER.exe limited a drive&#x27;s error recovery time. The utility enabled TLER (time limited error recovery), which limits the error recovery time to seven seconds. Around September 2009, Western Digital disabled this feature in their desktop drives (such as the Caviar Black line), making such drives unsuitable for use in RAID configurations. However, Western Digital enterprise class drives are shipped from the factory with TLER enabled. Similar technologies are used by Seagate, Samsung, and Hitachi. For non-RAID usage, an enterprise class drive with a short error recovery timeout that cannot be changed is therefore less suitable than a desktop drive. In late 2010, the Smartmontools program began supporting the configuration of ATA Error Recovery Control, allowing the tool to configure many desktop class hard drives for use in RAID setups.

While RAID may protect against physical drive failure, the data is still exposed to operator, software, hardware, and virus destruction. Many studies cite operator fault as a common source of malfunction, such as a server operator replacing the incorrect drive in a faulty RAID, and disabling the system (even temporarily) in the process.

An array can be overwhelmed by catastrophic failure that exceeds its recovery capacity and the entire array is at risk of physical damage by fire, natural disaster, and human forces, however backups can be stored off site. An array is also vulnerable to controller failure because it is not always possible to migrate it to a new, different controller without data loss.

== Weaknesses ==
=== Correlated failures ===
In practice, the drives are often the same age (with similar wear) and subject to the same environment. Since many drive failures are due to mechanical issues (which are more likely on older drives), this violates the assumptions of independent, identical rate of failure amongst drives; failures are in fact statistically correlated. In practice, the chances for a second failure before the first has been recovered (causing data loss) are higher than the chances for random failures. In a study of about 100,000 drives, the probability of two drives in the same cluster failing within one hour was four times larger than predicted by the exponential statistical distribution—which characterizes processes in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. The probability of two failures in the same 10-hour period was twice as large as predicted by an exponential distribution.

=== Unrecoverable read errors during rebuild ===
Unrecoverable read errors (URE) present as sector read failures, also known as latent sector errors (LSE). The associated media assessment measure, unrecoverable bit error (UBE) rate, is typically guaranteed to be less than one bit in 1015 for enterprise-class drives (SCSI, FC, SAS or SATA), and less than one bit in 1014 for desktop-class drives (IDE/ATA/PATA or SATA). Increasing drive capacities and large RAID 5 instances have led to the maximum error rates being insufficient to guarantee a successful recovery, due to the high likelihood of such an error occurring on one or more remaining drives during a RAID set rebuild. When rebuilding, parity-based schemes such as RAID 5 are particularly prone to the effects of UREs as they affect not only the sector where they occur, but also reconstructed blocks using that sector for parity computation.

Double-protection parity-based schemes, such as RAID 6, attempt to address this issue by providing redundancy that allows double-drive failures; as a downside, such schemes suffer from elevated write penalty—the number of times the storage medium must be accessed during a single write operation. Schemes that duplicate (mirror) data in a drive-to-drive manner, such as RAID 1 and RAID 10, have a lower risk from UREs than those using parity computation or mirroring between striped sets. Data scrubbing, as a background process, can be used to detect and recover from UREs, effectively reducing the risk of them happening during RAID rebuilds and causing double-drive failures. The recovery of UREs involves remapping of affected underlying disk sectors, utilizing the drive&#x27;s sector remapping pool; in case of UREs detected during background scrubbing, data redundancy provided by a fully operational RAID set allows the missing data to be reconstructed and rewritten to a remapped sector.

=== Increasing rebuild time and failure probability ===
Drive capacity has grown at a much faster rate than transfer speed, and error rates have only fallen a little in comparison. Therefore, larger-capacity drives may take hours if not days to rebuild, during which time other drives may fail or yet undetected read errors may surface. The rebuild time is also limited if the entire array is still in operation at reduced capacity. Given an array with only one redundant drive (which applies to RAID levels 3, 4 and 5, and to &quot;classic&quot; two-drive RAID 1), a second drive failure would cause complete failure of the array. Even though individual drives&#x27; mean time between failure (MTBF) have increased over time, this increase has not kept pace with the increased storage capacity of the drives. The time to rebuild the array after a single drive failure, as well as the chance of a second failure during a rebuild, have increased over time.

Some commentators have declared that RAID 6 is only a &quot;band aid&quot; in this respect, because it only kicks the problem a little further down the road. However, according to the 2006 NetApp study of Berriman et al., the chance of failure decreases by a factor of about 3,800 (relative to RAID 5) for a proper implementation of RAID 6, even when using commodity drives. Nevertheless, if the currently observed technology trends remain unchanged, in 2019 a RAID 6 array will have the same chance of failure as its RAID 5 counterpart had in 2010.

Mirroring schemes such as RAID 10 have a bounded recovery time as they require the copy of a single failed drive, compared with parity schemes such as RAID 6, which require the copy of all blocks of the drives in an array set. Triple parity schemes, or triple mirroring, have been suggested as one approach to improve resilience to an additional drive failure during this large rebuild time.

=== Atomicity ===

A system crash or other interruption of a write operation can result in states where the parity is inconsistent with the data due to non-atomicity of the write process, such that the parity cannot be used for recovery in the case of a disk failure. This is commonly termed the &quot;write hole&quot; which is a known data corruption issue in older and low-end RAIDs, caused by interrupted destaging of writes to disk. The write hole can be addressed in a few ways:

* Write-ahead logging.
** Hardware RAID systems use an onboard nonvolatile cache for this purpose.
** mdadm can use a dedicated journaling device (to avoid performance penalty, typically, SSDs and NVMs are preferred) for this purpose.
* Write intent logging. mdadm uses a &quot;write-intent-bitmap&quot;. If it finds any location marked as incompletely written at startup, it resyncs them. It closes the write hole but does not protect against loss of in-transit data, unlike a full WAL.
* Partial parity. mdadm can save a &quot;partial parity&quot; that, when combined with modified chunks, recovers the original parity. This closes the write hole, but again does not protect against loss of in-transit data.
* Dynamic stripe size. RAID-Z ensures that each block is its own stripe, so every block is complete. Copy-on-write (COW) transactional semantics guard metadata associated with stripes. The downside is IO fragmentation.
* Avoiding overwriting used stripes. bcachefs, which uses a copying garbage collector, chooses this option. COW again protect references to striped data. 

Write hole is a little understood and rarely mentioned failure mode for redundant storage systems that do not utilize transactional features. Database researcher Jim Gray wrote &quot;Update in Place is a Poison Apple&quot; during the early days of relational database commercialization.

=== Write-cache reliability ===
There are concerns about write-cache reliability, specifically regarding devices equipped with a write-back cache, which is a caching system that reports the data as written as soon as it is written to cache, as opposed to when it is written to the non-volatile medium. If the system experiences a power loss or other major failure, the data may be irrevocably lost from the cache before reaching the non-volatile storage. For this reason good write-back cache implementations include mechanisms, such as redundant battery power, to preserve cache contents across system failures (including power failures) and to flush the cache at system restart time.

<text>In computational complexity theory,  is the set of all decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in exponential space, i.e., in formula_1 space, where formula_2 is a polynomial function of formula_3. Some authors restrict formula_2 to be a linear function, but most authors instead call the resulting class . If we use a nondeterministic machine instead, we get the class , which is equal to by Savitch&#x27;s theorem.

A decision problem is if it is in , and every problem in has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to it. In other words, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that transforms instances of one to instances of the other with the same answer. problems might be thought of as the hardest problems in .

== Examples of problems ==

An example of an problem is the problem of recognizing whether two regular expressions represent different languages, where the expressions are limited to four operators: union, concatenation, the Kleene star (zero or more copies of an expression), and squaring (two copies of an expression).

Alur and Henzinger extended linear temporal logic with times (integer) and prove that the validity problem of their logic is EXPSPACE-complete.

The coverability problem for Petri Nets is -complete.

The reachability problem for Petri nets was known to be -hard for a long time, but shown to be nonelementary, so probably not in . In 2022 it was shown to be Ackermann-complete.

<text>William George Rushton (18 August 1937 – 11 December 1996) was an English cartoonist, comedian actor and satirist who co-founded the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;.

==Early life==
Rushton was born 18 August 1937 at 3 Wilbraham Place, Chelsea, London, the only child of publisher John Atherton Rushton (1908–1958) and his Welsh wife Veronica (née James, 1910–1977). He was educated at Shrewsbury School where he was not particularly successful academically, but met his future &quot;Private Eye&quot; colleagues Richard Ingrams, Paul Foot and Christopher Booker. He also contributed to the satirical magazine &quot;The Wallopian&quot;, (a play on the school magazine name &quot;The Salopian&quot;) mocking school spirit, traditions and the masters. Later, he said he recalled little of his schooldays, except that &quot;it was Blandings country. The sort of place where you go to die, not to be educated&quot;.

After school, Rushton had to undertake two years of national service in the army, where he failed officer selection. He later commented, &quot;The Army is, God bless it, one of the funniest institutions on earth and also a sort of microcosm of the world. It&#x27;s split almost perfectly into our class system. Through serving in the ranks I discovered the basic wit of my fellow man – whom basically, to tell the truth, I&#x27;d never met before.&quot; On leaving the army, he worked in a solicitor&#x27;s office for a short period.

==&quot;Private Eye&quot; and the satire boom==
Rushton remained in contact with his friends from Shrewsbury School, who had added John Wells to their number and were now running their own humour magazines at Oxford University, &quot;Parsons Pleasure&quot; and &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;, to which Rushton made many contributions during his frequent visits to meet them. A cartoon of a giraffe in a bar saying &quot;The high balls are on me&quot; was not met with approval by everyone in the university administrative quarters. Rushton suggested that &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; could continue after they left university. During his time as a clerk he had been sending his cartoons out to &quot;Punch&quot; but none had been accepted. After being knocked over by a bus, he gave up his job as a clerk, determined not to waste another day.

After almost but not quite being accepted by &quot;Tribune&quot; (a Labour-supporting newspaper edited by Michael Foot, Paul&#x27;s uncle), Rushton found a place at the &quot;Liberal News&quot;, which was also employing Christopher Booker as a journalist. From June 1960 until March 1961, he contributed a weekly strip, &quot;Brimstone Belcher&quot;, following the exploits of the titular journalist (a fore-runner of &quot;Private Eye&quot;″s Lunchtime O&#x27;Booze), from bizarre skulduggery in the British colonies (where the soldiers holding back the politicised rabble bear a strong resemblance to privates Rushton and Ingrams), travelogues through the US, and the hazards of by-electioneering as the independent candidate for the constituency of Gumboot North. After the strip folded, Rushton still contributed a weekly political cartoon to the &quot;Liberal News&quot; until mid-1962.

The Salopians finally found a financier for their magazine and the first issue of &quot;Private Eye&quot; was published on 25 October 1961. Rushton created the magazine in his bedroom in Scarsdale Villas using Letraset and cow-gumming illustrations onto cards which were taken away to be photo-lithographed. He also contributed all the illustrations and the mast-head figure of Little Gnitty (who still appears on the cover, a blended caricature of John Wells and the &quot;Daily Express&quot; standard-head). One critic described the original lay-out of the magazine as owing much to &quot;Neo-Brechtian Nihilism&quot;, although Rushton thought it resembled a betting shop floor. One feature in the early issues was the &quot;Aesop Revisited&quot;, a full-page comic strip which let him work in a wealth of puns and background jokes.

With &quot;Private Eye&quot; riding the satire boom, Peter Cook soon took an interest and contributed two serials recounting the bizarre adventures of Sir Basil Nardly-Stoads and the Rhandi Phurr, both of which were illustrated by Rushton, as was &quot;Mrs Wilson&#x27;s Diary&quot;. In the early days the team also worked on two books, &quot;Private Eye on London&quot; and &quot;Private Eye&#x27;s Romantic England&quot; that made heavy use of Rushton&#x27;s cartooning talents. One of the first &quot;Private Eye&quot;-published books was Rushton&#x27;s first collection of cartoons, &quot;Willie Rushton&#x27;s Dirty Weekend Book&quot;, which was subsequently banned in Ireland on the grounds of its explicitness.

Reuniting with his Salopian friends had also reawakened Rushton&#x27;s taste for acting. After they had finished university, he had accompanied his friends in a well-received revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. (Richard Burton even appeared one night in their parody of &quot;Luther&quot;.) In 1961, Richard Ingrams directed a production of Spike Milligan&#x27;s surreal post-nuclear apocalypse farce &quot;The Bed-Sitting Room&quot;, in which Rushton was hailed by Kenneth Tynan as &quot;brilliant&quot;. But it was a cabaret at the Room at the Top, a chicken-in-a-basket nightclub at the top of a department store in Ilford, that really launched his career. Rushton recalled meeting the Kray twins in the audience one night and that fellow performer Barbara Windsor &quot;wouldn&#x27;t come out for a drink that night&quot;. The revue also starred John Wells.

Rushton&#x27;s impersonation of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan caught the attention of Ned Sherrin, a young BBC producer searching for talent to appear in a forthcoming TV satire series. &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot; (aka &quot;TW3&quot;) ran from November 1962 until December 1963. It drew audiences of up to 13 million, making stars of its cast, particularly David Frost. Rushton became known for his impersonation of the Prime Minister, a daring novelty in those respectful days. &quot;It&#x27;s the only impersonation that people have ever actually recognised – so I&#x27;m very grateful to the old bugger ... But then I had voted for him, so he owed me something.&quot; Rushton also appeared on the original flexi-discs of skits, squibs and invective that &quot;Private Eye&quot; gave away, having success with two self-penned songs: &quot;Neasden&quot; and the &quot;Bum Song&quot;. He also wrote songs for &quot;TW3&quot;, many of which were revisited on later solo albums like &quot;Now in Bottles&quot; and &quot;The Complete Works&quot;.

In the autumn of 1963, a health scare led Macmillan to resign and Sir Alec Douglas-Home became prime minister. It was necessary that Douglas-Home resign his peerage to find a safe Parliamentary seat. The &quot;Private Eye&quot; team were so disgusted by the Conservative Party&#x27;s machinations that they decided to stand their own protest candidate in the Kinross and Western Perthshire by-election. Since he was the most well-known member of the team, Rushton was the obvious choice to stand. Rushton gained much attention from journalists, since he stood under the slogan &quot;Death to the Tories&quot;. He polled only 45 votes, having advised his supporters at the last minute to vote Liberal, the Conservatives&#x27; only credible challenger. Douglas-Home won.

Rushton described his political beliefs as being &quot;left of Limbo&quot; stating that he had always voted for Labour because he felt their attitude to life was &quot;more generous than anyone else&#x27;s&quot; but would happily take potshots at anyone who said something silly.

==Films, television and radio==
When &quot;TW3&quot; was cancelled in anticipation of the 1964 election, Rushton and some of the cast, as well as some of the members of the Cambridge University revue &quot;Cambridge Circus&quot; (including future Goodies Tim Brooke-Taylor and Bill Oddie), went on tour in America as &quot;David Frost Presents TW3&quot;. Rushton and Barry Fantoni (another &quot;Private Eye&quot; contributor) entered a painting titled &quot;Nude Reclining&quot;, a satirical portrait of three establishment types, for the 1963 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition under the name of Stuart Harris, which excited much controversy. He also began a career as a character actor for films in 1963. In late 1964 Rushton was involved as one of the hosts in the early episodes of another satirical programme, &quot;Not So Much a Programme&quot;, but drifted away as it became the vehicle that launched David Frost as a chat show host. In 1964 he appeared as Richard Burbage in Sherrin and Caryl Brahms&#x27; musical of &quot;No Bed for Bacon&quot;, while his early stature as a personality was confirmed by a cartoon advert he devised for the Brewers&#x27; Society proclaiming the charms of the local pub. Rushton performed his own host duties for &quot;New Stars and Garters&quot;, a variety entertainment show in 1965, where he first met Arlene Dorgan. He also appeared as a guest in programmes including &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot; with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.

During the late 1960s, Rushton spent much of his time in Australia, following Dorgan back to her homeland. He married her in 1968. He also had several series of his own on Australian television, &quot;Don’t Adjust Your Set – The Programme is at Fault&quot; and &quot;From Rushton with Love&quot;. He said of Australia, &quot;They&#x27;ve got their priorities right, they&#x27;re dedicated to lying in the sun, knocking back ice-cold beer&quot;. During this period he found time to model for &quot;She&quot; magazine and also appear in a 1967 stage production of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; as Squire Trelawney, alongside Spike Milligan and Barry Humphries, at the Mermaid Theatre in London. It was on one of his return visits to the UK in 1968 that he also brought back the late Tony Hancock&#x27;s ashes to the UK in an Air France bag – &quot;My session with the Customs was a Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour in itself.&quot;

He appeared in cameo roles in films, including &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; (1965), &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust&quot; (1969), &quot;The Best House in London&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&quot; (1972). He played Tim Brooke-Taylor&#x27;s gay husband in Sharon Tate&#x27;s last film before her murder, &quot;The Thirteen Chairs&quot; (1969), and Tobias Cromwell in &quot;Flight of the Doves&quot; (1971), as well as appearing in sex comedies such as &quot;Keep It Up Downstairs&quot; (1976), &quot;Adventures of a Private Eye&quot; (1977) and &quot;Adventures of a Plumber&#x27;s Mate&quot; (1978). His final film appearance was as Big Teddy in &quot;Consuming Passions&quot; released in 1988. As a TV actor in the 1970s he appeared in episodes of popular programmes as different as &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;, &quot;Colditz&quot; (episode: &quot;The Guests&quot; – Major Trumpington in a kilt) and &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot; as the narrator Plautus. He was Dr Watson to John Cleese&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes in N. F. Simpson&#x27;s surreal comedy &quot;Elementary, My Dear Watson&quot;. In 1975 and 1976 he appeared in well-received pantomimes of &quot;Gulliver’s Travels&quot;; in 1981 in Eric Idle&#x27;s &quot;Pass the Butler&quot;; and in 1988 as Peter Tinniswood&#x27;s irascible Brigadier in &quot;Tales from a Long Room&quot;. Rushton also wrote two musicals:
* &quot;Liz of Lambeth&quot; in 1976.
* &quot;Tallulah Who?&quot; in 1991, with Suzi Quatro and Shirlie Roden.

In this period, he also found time to contribute seven humorous, spoken word pieces for the double LP, &quot;Tale of Ale&quot;.

His last major solo TV project was &quot;Rushton&#x27;s Illustrated&quot; (1980; partially wiped by ATV which often did not keep programmes considered of no international sales value). By now he was an established guest on quiz shows and celebrity panel games: &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;, &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;, &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot;. When asked why he appeared on these &quot;ludicrous programmes&quot;, his answer was simple: &quot;Because I meet everybody there&quot;.

For 22 years until his death, he was a panellist in the long-running BBC Radio 4 panel comedy game show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, which he joined as a regular team member in the third series in 1974. In its later years, the show&#x27;s wealth of silliness, smut and punning was drawing audiences of up to a thousand people for its recordings. In 1990 he teamed up with his co-panellist Barry Cryer in their own show &quot;Two old Farts in the Night&quot;, performing to full audiences at the Edinburgh festival, the Royal Albert Hall and the Festival Hall, touring the country irregularly until Rushton&#x27;s death.

He played a recurring character as a policeman in Southern Television&#x27;s 1970–73 children&#x27;s show &quot;Little Big Time&quot; with Freddie Garrity; his policeman&#x27;s helmet bore a blue flashing light. His manner and voice meant Rushton was in constant demand for adverts, voice-overs and presenting jobs. In the mid-1970s, his reading of &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Jackanory&quot; was particularly popular. He also provided all the voices for the claymation animated series &quot;The Trap Door&quot; in the late 1980s. He was a popular choice for narrating audio books, especially those for children. In particular he recorded 18 of the books by the Rev. W. Awdry for &quot;The Railway Stories&quot; series. He also recorded adaptations of Asterix books and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and provided the voice of the King in the early animated Muzzy films. In the early 1980s he wrote and illustrated a series of children&#x27;s books about &quot;The Incredible Cottage&quot;, and provided illustrations for many children&#x27;s books.

Rushton had not been involved in &quot;Private Eye&quot; since the latter part of the 1960s, other than a brief stint illustrating &quot;Mrs Wilson&#x27;s Diary&quot; when the Labour Party came back into power in the mid-1970s. He returned to &quot;Private Eye&quot; in 1978 to take over the task of illustrating &quot;Auberon Waugh&#x27;s Diary&quot;, which continued until 1986. The cartoons perfectly complemented Auberon Waugh&#x27;s scabrous and surreal flights of invective, and when Waugh moved his column to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as the &quot;Way of the World&quot; in 1990, Rushton followed, drawing at Waugh&#x27;s instruction such surreal concepts as Richard Ingrams pretending to be a seven-year-old choirgirl, the head of a dead cow coming out of a computer connected to the then-new (in common usage) internet and a nude statue of Benjamin Britten with a bird bath discreetly covering its private parts.

The Victoria and Albert Museum, recognising his accomplishments, commissioned 24 large colour illustrations which were collected as &quot;Willie Rushton&#x27;s Great Moments of History&quot;. (Rushton had previous experience with the V&amp;A when he had pulled a prank on the institution by labelling an electric plug socket in one of the galleries: &quot;Plug hole designed by Hans Plug (b. 1908)&quot;, which remained for a full year – to the great annoyance of a cleaner who had to use a hefty extension lead for 12 months so as not to damage the exhibit.) This large-scale excursion into the use of colour was good practice for the monthly colour covers he created for the &quot;Literary Review&quot; when Waugh became its editor in 1986. Rushton drew these covers along with the fortnightly caricatures for &quot;Private Eye&quot;″s literary review page until he died.

Rushton had always been conscious of his weight, listing his recreations in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; as &quot;gaining weight, losing weight and parking&quot;, and in 1973 he had been the host of a slimming programme, &quot;Don&#x27;t Just Sit There&quot;. His first major health scare had been the onset of diabetes (the cause of his father&#x27;s death in 1958). Having to give up beer, Rushton became, according to Ingrams, &quot;quite grumpy as a result, but his grumpiness had an admirable and jaunty quality to it.&quot; A sudden loss of three stone had prevented him from playing in Prince Rainier&#x27;s XI at Monte Carlo, Monaco. Rushton was always passionate about cricket. His father had sent him for coaching at Lord&#x27;s before he went to Shrewsbury. His cricket and general knowledge were called upon in his role as a regular team captain on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s quiz show &quot;Trivia Test Match&quot; with Tim Rice and Brian Johnston, which ran from 1986 to 1993. Rushton was always an enthusiastic cricketer, playing in the Lord&#x27;s Taverners, a charity celebrity cricket team.

In 1989 he performed in &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Biggest Ball&quot;. His act consisted of singing &quot;Top Hat, White Tie and Tails&quot; and acting out the lyrics, which left him standing in a top hat, white tie, and tails – but no trousers. In his later years his cartoons were part of an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery.

==Death and memorials==
Rushton died of a heart attack at Cromwell Hospital, Kensington on 11 December 1996, aged 59. Ten years earlier, he had made a jocular prediction that he would die that year. In the first episode of Series 13 of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, which aired on 26 July 1986, Chairman Humphrey Lyttelton asked the panellists to &quot;gaze into their crystal balls&quot; and make predictions for 1996. Rushton said, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry you introduced this round, because I just spotted a memorial service for myself in Westminster Abbey in January&quot;.
Among his last words was the advice, &quot;Tell Bazza he&#x27;s too old to do pantomime&quot;, meant for his long-time friend Barry Cryer.

Rushton is honoured by a Comic Heritage blue plaque at Mornington Crescent tube station, a reference to the game Mornington Crescent on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t A Clue&quot;.

BBC Radio 7 showcased his contribution to &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, in the week of the 10th anniversary of his death, by rebroadcasting five episodes of the show, one on each weekday night (11–15 December 2006). The broadcasts chosen included the last shows he recorded for the programme.

According to the autobiography of Nicholas Parsons, Rushton&#x27;s ashes were buried by the boundary at The Oval cricket ground.
