<text>Newton&#x27;s laws of motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. These laws, which provide the basis for Newtonian mechanics, can be paraphrased as follows:
# A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless it is acted upon by a force.
# At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body&#x27;s acceleration multiplied by its mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body&#x27;s momentum is changing with time.
# If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

The three laws of motion were first stated by Isaac Newton in his &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (&quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;), originally published in 1687. Newton used them to investigate and explain the motion of many physical objects and systems. In the time since Newton, new insights, especially around the concept of energy, built the field of classical mechanics on his foundations. Limitations to Newton&#x27;s laws have also been discovered; new theories are necessary when objects move at very high speeds (special relativity), are very massive (general relativity), or are very small (quantum mechanics).

== Prerequisites ==
Newton&#x27;s laws are often stated in terms of &quot;point&quot; or &quot;particle&quot; masses, that is, bodies whose volume is negligible. This is a reasonable approximation for real bodies when the motion of internal parts can be neglected, and when the separation between bodies is much larger than the size of each. For instance, the Earth and the Sun can both be approximated as pointlike when considering the orbit of the former around the latter, but the Earth is not pointlike when considering activities on its surface.

The mathematical description of motion, or kinematics, is based on the idea of specifying positions using numerical coordinates. Movement is represented by these numbers changing over time: a body&#x27;s trajectory is represented by a function that assigns to each value of a time variable the values of all the position coordinates. The simplest case is one-dimensional, that is, when a body is constrained to move only along a straight line. Its position can then be given by a single number, indicating where it is relative to some chosen reference point. For example, a body might be free to slide along a track that runs left to right, and so its location can be specified by its distance from a convenient zero point, or origin, with negative numbers indicating positions to the left and positive numbers indicating positions to the right. If the body&#x27;s location as a function of time is formula_1, then its average velocity over the time interval from formula_2 to formula_3 is formula_4Here, the Greek letter formula_5 (delta) is used, per tradition, to mean &quot;change in&quot;. A positive average velocity means that the position coordinate formula_6 increases over the interval in question, a negative average velocity indicates a net decrease over that interval, and an average velocity of zero means that the body ends the time interval in the same place as it began. Calculus gives the means to define an &quot;instantaneous&quot; velocity, a measure of a body&#x27;s speed and direction of movement at a single moment of time, rather than over an interval. One notation for the instantaneous velocity is to replace formula_5 with the symbol formula_8, for example,formula_9This denotes that the instantaneous velocity is the derivative of the position with respect to time. It can roughly be thought of as the ratio between an infinitesimally small change in position formula_10 to the infinitesimally small time interval formula_11 over which it occurs. More carefully, the velocity and all other derivatives can be defined using the concept of a limit. A function formula_12 has a limit of formula_13 at a given input value formula_2 if the difference between formula_15 and formula_13 can be made arbitrarily small by choosing an input sufficiently close to formula_2. One writes, formula_18Instantaneous velocity can be defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval shrinks to zero:formula_19 &quot;Acceleration&quot; is to velocity as velocity is to position: it is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time. Acceleration can likewise be defined as a limit:formula_20Consequently, the acceleration is the &quot;second derivative&quot; of position, often written formula_21.

Position, when thought of as a displacement from an origin point, is a vector: a quantity with both magnitude and direction. Velocity and acceleration are vector quantities as well. The mathematical tools of vector algebra provide the means to describe motion in two, three or more dimensions. Vectors are often denoted with an arrow, as in formula_22, or in bold typeface, such as formula_23. Often, vectors are represented visually as arrows, with the direction of the vector being the direction of the arrow, and the magnitude of the vector indicated by the length of the arrow. Numerically, a vector can be represented as a list; for example, a body&#x27;s velocity vector might be formula_24, indicating that it is moving at 3 metres per second along the horizontal axis and 4 metres per second along the vertical axis. The same motion described in a different coordinate system will be represented by different numbers, and vector algebra can be used to translate between these alternatives. 

The study of mechanics is complicated by the fact that household words like &quot;energy&quot; are used with a technical meaning. Moreover, words which are synonymous in everyday speech are not so in physics: &quot;force&quot; is not the same as &quot;power&quot; or &quot;pressure&quot;, for example, and &quot;mass&quot; has a different meaning than &quot;weight&quot;. The physics concept of &quot;force&quot; makes quantitative the everyday idea of a push or a pull. Forces in Newtonian mechanics are often due to strings and ropes, friction, muscle effort, gravity, and so forth. Like displacement, velocity, and acceleration, force is a vector quantity.

== Laws ==

===First law===

Translated from Latin, Newton&#x27;s first law reads,
:&quot;Every object perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon.&quot;
Newton&#x27;s first law expresses the principle of inertia: the natural behavior of a body is to move in a straight line at constant speed. A body&#x27;s motion preserves the status quo, but external forces can perturb this.

The modern understanding of Newton&#x27;s first law is that no inertial observer is privileged over any other. The concept of an inertial observer makes quantitative the everyday idea of feeling no effects of motion. For example, a person standing on the ground watching a train go past is an inertial observer. If the observer on the ground sees the train moving smoothly in a straight line at a constant speed, then a passenger sitting on the train will also be an inertial observer: the train passenger &quot;feels&quot; no motion. The principle expressed by Newton&#x27;s first law is that there is no way to say which inertial observer is &quot;really&quot; moving and which is &quot;really&quot; standing still. One observer&#x27;s state of rest is another observer&#x27;s state of uniform motion in a straight line, and no experiment can deem either point of view to be correct or incorrect. There is no absolute standard of rest. Newton himself believed that absolute space and time existed, but that the only measures of space or time accessible to experiment are relative.

===Second law===
:&quot;The change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed; and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed.&quot;
By &quot;motion&quot;, Newton meant the quantity now called momentum, which depends upon the amount of matter contained in a body, the speed at which that body is moving, and the direction in which it is moving. In modern notation, the momentum of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity:
formula_25
where all three quantities can change over time.
Newton&#x27;s second law, in modern form, states that the time derivative of the momentum is the force:
formula_26
If the mass formula_27 does not change with time, then the derivative acts only upon the velocity, and so the force equals the product of the mass and the time derivative of the velocity, which is the acceleration:
formula_28
As the acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect to time, this can also be written
formula_29

 The forces acting on a body add as vectors, and so the total force on a body depends upon both the magnitudes and the directions of the individual forces. When the net force on a body is equal to zero, then by Newton&#x27;s second law, the body does not accelerate, and it is said to be in mechanical equilibrium. A state of mechanical equilibrium is &quot;stable&quot; if, when the position of the body is changed slightly, the body remains near that equilibrium. Otherwise, the equilibrium is &quot;unstable.&quot;

A common visual representation of forces acting in concert is the free body diagram, which schematically portrays a body of interest and the forces applied to it by outside influences. For example, a free body diagram of a block sitting upon an inclined plane can illustrate the combination of gravitational force, &quot;normal&quot; force, friction, and string tension.

Newton&#x27;s second law is sometimes presented as a &quot;definition&quot; of force, i.e., a force is that which exists when an inertial observer sees a body accelerating. In order for this to be more than a tautology — acceleration implies force, force implies acceleration — some other statement about force must also be made. For example, an equation detailing the force might be specified, like Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. By inserting such an expression for formula_30 into Newton&#x27;s second law, an equation with predictive power can be written. Newton&#x27;s second law has also been regarded as setting out a research program for physics, establishing that important goals of the subject are to identify the forces present in nature and to catalogue the constituents of matter.

===Third law===
:&quot;To every action, there is always opposed an equal reaction; or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.&quot;

Overly brief paraphrases of the third law, like &quot;action equals reaction&quot; might have caused confusion among generations of students: the &quot;action&quot; and &quot;reaction&quot; apply to different bodies. For example, consider a book at rest on a table. The Earth&#x27;s gravity pulls down upon the book. The &quot;reaction&quot; to that &quot;action&quot; is &quot;not&quot; the support force from the table holding up the book, but the gravitational pull of the book acting on the Earth.

Newton&#x27;s third law relates to a more fundamental principle, the conservation of momentum. The latter remains true even in cases where Newton&#x27;s statement does not, for instance when force fields as well as material bodies carry momentum, and when momentum is defined properly, in quantum mechanics as well. In Newtonian mechanics, if two bodies have momenta formula_31 and formula_32 respectively, then the total momentum of the pair is formula_33, and the rate of change of formula_34 is formula_35 By Newton&#x27;s second law, the first term is the total force upon the first body, and the second term is the total force upon the second body. If the two bodies are isolated from outside influences, the only force upon the first body can be that from the second, and vice versa. By Newton&#x27;s third law, these forces have equal magnitude but opposite direction, so they cancel when added, and formula_34 is constant. Alternatively, if formula_34 is known to be constant, it follows that the forces have equal magnitude and opposite direction.

===Candidates for additional laws===
Various sources have proposed elevating other ideas used in classical mechanics to the status of Newton&#x27;s laws. For example, in Newtonian mechanics, the total mass of a body made by bringing together two smaller bodies is the sum of their individual masses. Frank Wilczek has suggested calling attention to this assumption by designating it &quot;Newton&#x27;s Zeroth Law&quot;. Another candidate for a &quot;zeroth law&quot; is the fact that at any instant, a body reacts to the forces applied to it at that instant. Likewise, the idea that forces add like vectors (or in other words obey the superposition principle), and the idea that forces change the energy of a body, have both been described as a &quot;fourth law&quot;.

Moreover, some texts organize the basic ideas of Newtonian mechanics into different postulates, other than the three laws as commonly phrased, with the goal of being more clear about what is empirically observed and what is true by definition.

===Examples===
The study of the behavior of massive bodies using Newton&#x27;s laws is known as Newtonian mechanics. Some example problems in Newtonian mechanics are particularly noteworthy for conceptual or historical reasons.

====Uniformly accelerated motion====
If a body falls from rest near the surface of the Earth, then in the absence of air resistance, it will accelerate at a constant rate. This is known as free fall. The speed attained during free fall is proportional to the elapsed time, and the distance traveled is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. Importantly, the acceleration is the same for all bodies, independently of their mass. This follows from combining Newton&#x27;s second law of motion with his law of universal gravitation. The latter states that the magnitude of the gravitational force from the Earth upon the body is
formula_38
where formula_27 is the mass of the falling body, formula_40 is the mass of the Earth, formula_41 is Newton&#x27;s constant, and formula_42 is the distance from the center of the Earth to the body&#x27;s location, which is very nearly the radius of the Earth. Setting this equal to formula_43, the body&#x27;s mass formula_27 cancels from both sides of the equation, leaving an acceleration that depends upon formula_41, formula_40, and formula_42, and formula_42 can be taken to be constant. This particular value of acceleration is typically denoted formula_49:
formula_50

If the body is not released from rest but instead launched upwards and/or horizontally with nonzero velocity, then free fall becomes projectile motion. When air resistance can be neglected, projectiles follow parabola-shaped trajectories, because gravity affects the body&#x27;s vertical motion and not its horizontal. At the peak of the projectile&#x27;s trajectory, its vertical velocity is zero, but its acceleration is formula_49 downwards, as it is at all times. Setting the wrong vector equal to zero is a common confusion among physics students.

====Uniform circular motion====
When a body is in uniform circular motion, the force on it changes the direction of its motion but not its speed. For a body moving in a circle of radius formula_42 at a constant speed formula_53, its acceleration has a magnitudeformula_54and is directed toward the center of the circle. The force required to sustain this acceleration, called the centripetal force, is therefore also directed toward the center of the circle and has magnitude formula_55. Many orbits, such as that of the Moon around the Earth, can be approximated by uniform circular motion. In such cases, the centripetal force is gravity, and by Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation has magnitude formula_56, where formula_40 is the mass of the larger body being orbited. Therefore, the mass of a body can be calculated from observations of another body orbiting around it.

Newton&#x27;s cannonball is a thought experiment that interpolates between projectile motion and uniform circular motion. A cannonball that is lobbed weakly off the edge of a tall cliff will hit the ground in the same amount of time as if it were dropped from rest, because the force of gravity only affects the cannonball&#x27;s momentum in the downward direction, and its effect is not diminished by horizontal movement. If the cannonball is launched with a greater initial horizontal velocity, then it will travel farther before it hits the ground, but it will still hit the ground in the same amount of time. However, if the cannonball is launched with an even larger initial velocity, then the curvature of the Earth becomes significant: the ground itself will curve away from the falling cannonball. A very fast cannonball will fall away from the inertial straight-line trajectory at the same rate that the Earth curves away beneath it; in other words, it will be in orbit (imagining that it is not slowed by air resistance or obstacles).

====Harmonic motion====
Consider a body of mass formula_27 able to move along the formula_59 axis, and suppose an equilibrium point exists at the position formula_60. That is, at formula_60, the net force upon the body is the zero vector, and by Newton&#x27;s second law, the body will not accelerate. If the force upon the body is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium point, and directed to the equilibrium point, then the body will perform simple harmonic motion. Writing the force as formula_62, Newton&#x27;s second law becomes
formula_63
This differential equation has the solution
formula_64
where the frequency formula_65 is equal to formula_66, and the constants formula_67 and formula_68 can be calculated knowing, for example, the position and velocity the body has at a given time, like formula_69.

One reason that the harmonic oscillator is a conceptually important example is that it is good approximation for many systems near a stable mechanical equilibrium. For example, a pendulum has a stable equilibrium in the vertical position: if motionless there, it will remain there, and if pushed slightly, it will swing back and forth. Neglecting air resistance and friction in the pivot, the force upon the pendulum is gravity, and Newton&#x27;s second law becomes formula_70where formula_13 is the length of the pendulum and formula_72 is its angle from the vertical. When the angle formula_72 is small, the sine of formula_72 is nearly equal to formula_72 (see small-angle approximation), and so this expression simplifies to the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with frequency formula_76.

A harmonic oscillator can be &quot;damped,&quot; often by friction or viscous drag, in which case energy bleeds out of the oscillator and the amplitude of the oscillations decreases over time. Also, a harmonic oscillator can be &quot;driven&quot; by an applied force, which can lead to the phenomenon of resonance.

====Objects with variable mass====
Newtonian physics treats matter as being neither created nor destroyed, though it may be rearranged. It can be the case that an object of interest gains or loses mass because matter is added to or removed from it. In such a situation, Newton&#x27;s laws can be applied to the individual pieces of matter, keeping track of which pieces belong to the object of interest over time. For instance, if a rocket of mass formula_77, moving at velocity formula_78, ejects matter at a velocity formula_79 relative to the rocket, then
formula_80
where formula_30 is the net external force (e.g., a planet&#x27;s gravitational pull).

====Fan and sail====

The fan and sail example is a situation studied in discussions of Newton&#x27;s third law. In the situation, a fan is attached to a cart or a sailboat and blows on its sail. From the third law, one would reason that the force of the air pushing in one direction would cancel out the force done by the fan on the sail, leaving the entire apparatus stationary. However, because the system is not entirely enclosed, there are conditions in which the vessel will move; for example, if the sail is built in a manner that redirects the majority of the airflow back towards the fan, the net force will result in the vessel moving forward.

==Work and energy==
The concept of energy was developed after Newton&#x27;s time, but it has become an inseparable part of what is considered &quot;Newtonian&quot; physics. Energy can broadly be classified into kinetic, due to a body&#x27;s motion, and potential, due to a body&#x27;s position relative to others. Thermal energy, the energy carried by heat flow, is a type of kinetic energy not associated with the macroscopic motion of objects but instead with the movements of the atoms and molecules of which they are made. According to the work-energy theorem, when a force acts upon a body while that body moves along the line of the force, the force does &quot;work&quot; upon the body, and the amount of work done is equal to the change in the body&#x27;s kinetic energy. In many cases of interest, the net work done by a force when a body moves in a closed loop — starting at a point, moving along some trajectory, and returning to the initial point — is zero. If this is the case, then the force can be written in terms of the gradient of a function called a scalar potential:
formula_82
This is true for many forces including that of gravity, but not for friction; indeed, almost any problem in a mechanics textbook that does not involve friction can be expressed in this way. The fact that the force can be written in this way can be understood from the conservation of energy. Without friction to dissipate a body&#x27;s energy into heat, the body&#x27;s energy will trade between potential and (non-thermal) kinetic forms while the total amount remains constant. Any gain of kinetic energy, which occurs when the net force on the body accelerates it to a higher speed, must be accompanied by a loss of potential energy. So, the net force upon the body is determined by the manner in which the potential energy decreases.

==Rigid-body motion and rotation==
A rigid body is an object whose size is too large to neglect and which maintains the same shape over time. In Newtonian mechanics, the motion of a rigid body is often understood by separating it into movement of the body&#x27;s center of mass and movement around the center of mass.

===Center of mass===
Significant aspects of the motion of an extended body can be understood by imagining the mass of that body concentrated to a single point, known as the center of mass. The location of a body&#x27;s center of mass depends upon how that body&#x27;s material is distributed. For a collection of pointlike objects with masses formula_83 at positions formula_84, the center of mass is located at formula_85 where formula_40 is the total mass of the collection. In the absence of a net external force, the center of mass moves at a constant speed in a straight line. This applies, for example, to a collision between two bodies. If the total external force is not zero, then the center of mass changes velocity as though it were a point body of mass formula_40. This follows from the fact that the internal forces within the collection, the forces that the objects exert upon each other, occur in balanced pairs by Newton&#x27;s third law. In a system of two bodies with one much more massive than the other, the center of mass will approximately coincide with the location of the more massive body.

===Rotational analogues of Newton&#x27;s laws===
When Newton&#x27;s laws are applied to rotating extended bodies, they lead to new quantities that are analogous to those invoked in the original laws. The analogue of mass is the moment of inertia, the counterpart of momentum is angular momentum, and the counterpart of force is torque.

Angular momentum is calculated with respect to a reference point. If the displacement vector from a reference point to a body is formula_88 and the body has momentum formula_34, then the body&#x27;s angular momentum with respect to that point is, using the vector cross product, formula_90 Taking the time derivative of the angular momentum gives formula_91 The first term vanishes because formula_92 and formula_93 point in the same direction. The remaining term is the torque, formula_94 When the torque is zero, the angular momentum is constant, just as when the force is zero, the momentum is constant. The torque can vanish even when the force is non-zero, if the body is located at the reference point (formula_95) or if the force formula_30 and the displacement vector formula_88 are directed along the same line.

The angular momentum of a collection of point masses, and thus of an extended body, is found by adding the contributions from each of the points. This provides a means to characterize a body&#x27;s rotation about an axis, by adding up the angular momenta of its individual pieces. The result depends on the chosen axis, the shape of the body, and the rate of rotation.

===Multi-body gravitational system===
Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation states that any body attracts any other body along the straight line connecting them. The size of the attracting force is proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Finding the shape of the orbits that an inverse-square force law will produce is known as the Kepler problem. The Kepler problem can be solved in multiple ways, including by demonstrating that the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector is constant, or by applying a duality transformation to a 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator. However it is solved, the result is that orbits will be conic sections, that is, ellipses (including circles), parabolas, or hyperbolas. The eccentricity of the orbit, and thus the type of conic section, is determined by the energy and the angular momentum of the orbiting body. Planets do not have sufficient energy to escape the Sun, and so their orbits are ellipses, to a good approximation; because the planets pull on one another, actual orbits are not exactly conic sections.

If a third mass is added, the Kepler problem becomes the three-body problem, which in general has no exact solution in closed form. That is, there is no way to start from the differential equations implied by Newton&#x27;s laws and, after a finite sequence of standard mathematical operations, obtain equations that express the three bodies&#x27; motions over time. Numerical methods can be applied to obtain useful, albeit approximate, results for the three-body problem. The positions and velocities of the bodies can be stored in variables within a computer&#x27;s memory; Newton&#x27;s laws are used to calculate how the velocities will change over a short interval of time, and knowing the velocities, the changes of position over that time interval can be computed. This process is looped to calculate, approximately, the bodies&#x27; trajectories. Generally speaking, the shorter the time interval, the more accurate the approximation.

==Chaos and unpredictability==

=== Nonlinear dynamics ===
Newton&#x27;s laws of motion allow the possibility of chaos. That is, qualitatively speaking, physical systems obeying Newton&#x27;s laws can exhibit sensitive dependence upon their initial conditions: a slight change of the position or velocity of one part of a system can lead to the whole system behaving in a radically different way within a short time. Noteworthy examples include the three-body problem, the double pendulum, dynamical billiards, and the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem.

Newton&#x27;s laws can be applied to fluids by considering a fluid as composed of infinitesimal pieces, each exerting forces upon neighboring pieces. The Euler momentum equation is an expression of Newton&#x27;s second law adapted to fluid dynamics. A fluid is described by a velocity field, i.e., a function formula_98 that assigns a velocity vector to each point in space and time. A small object being carried along by the fluid flow can change velocity for two reasons: first, because the velocity field at its position is changing over time, and second, because it moves to a new location where the velocity field has a different value. Consequently, when Newton&#x27;s second law is applied to an infinitesimal portion of fluid, the acceleration formula_99 has two terms, a combination known as a &quot;total&quot; or &quot;material&quot; derivative. The mass of an infinitesimal portion depends upon the fluid density, and there is a net force upon it if the fluid pressure varies from one side of it to another. Accordingly, formula_100 becomes
formula_101
where formula_102 is the density, formula_103 is the pressure, and formula_104 stands for an external influence like a gravitational pull. Incorporating the effect of viscosity turns the Euler equation into a Navier–Stokes equation:
formula_105
where formula_106 is the kinematic viscosity.

=== Singularities ===
It is mathematically possible for a collection of point masses, moving in accord with Newton&#x27;s laws, to launch some of themselves away so forcefully that they fly off to infinity in a finite time. This unphysical behavior, known as a &quot;noncollision singularity&quot;, depends upon the masses being pointlike and able to approach one another arbitrarily closely, as well as the lack of a relativistic speed limit in Newtonian physics.

It is not yet known whether or not the Euler and Navier–Stokes equations exhibit the analogous behavior of initially smooth solutions &quot;blowing up&quot; in finite time. The question of existence and smoothness of Navier–Stokes solutions is one of the Millennium Prize Problems.

==Relation to other formulations of classical physics==
Classical mechanics can be mathematically formulated in multiple different ways, other than the &quot;Newtonian&quot; description (which itself, of course, incorporates contributions from others both before and after Newton). The physical content of these different formulations is the same as the Newtonian, but they provide different insights and facilitate different types of calculations. For example, Lagrangian mechanics helps make apparent the connection between symmetries and conservation laws, and it is useful when calculating the motion of constrained bodies, like a mass restricted to move along a curving track or on the surface of a sphere. Hamiltonian mechanics is convenient for statistical physics, leads to further insight about symmetry, and can be developed into sophisticated techniques for perturbation theory. Due to the breadth of these topics, the discussion here will be confined to concise treatments of how they reformulate Newton&#x27;s laws of motion.

===Lagrangian===
Lagrangian mechanics differs from the Newtonian formulation by considering entire trajectories at once rather than predicting a body&#x27;s motion at a single instant. It is traditional in Lagrangian mechanics to denote position with formula_107 and velocity with formula_108. The simplest example is a massive point particle, the Lagrangian for which can be written as the difference between its kinetic and potential energies:
formula_109
where the kinetic energy is
formula_110
and the potential energy is some function of the position, formula_111. The physical path that the particle will take between an initial point formula_112 and a final point formula_113 is the path for which the integral of the Lagrangian is &quot;stationary&quot;. That is, the physical path has the property that small perturbations of it will, to a first approximation, not change the integral of the Lagrangian. Calculus of variations provides the mathematical tools for finding this path. Applying the calculus of variations to the task of finding the path yields the Euler–Lagrange equation for the particle,
formula_114
Evaluating the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian gives
formula_115
which is a restatement of Newton&#x27;s second law. The left-hand side is the time derivative of the momentum, and the right-hand side is the force, represented in terms of the potential energy.

Landau and Lifshitz argue that the Lagrangian formulation makes the conceptual content of classical mechanics more clear than starting with Newton&#x27;s laws. Lagrangian mechanics provides a convenient framework in which to prove Noether&#x27;s theorem, which relates symmetries and conservation laws. The conservation of momentum can be derived by applying Noether&#x27;s theorem to a Lagrangian for a multi-particle system, and so, Newton&#x27;s third law is a theorem rather than an assumption.

===Hamiltonian===

In Hamiltonian mechanics, the dynamics of a system are represented by a function called the Hamiltonian, which in many cases of interest is equal to the total energy of the system. The Hamiltonian is a function of the positions and the momenta of all the bodies making up the system, and it may also depend explicitly upon time. The time derivatives of the position and momentum variables are given by partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian, via Hamilton&#x27;s equations. The simplest example is a point mass formula_27 constrained to move in a straight line, under the effect of a potential. Writing formula_107 for the position coordinate and formula_118 for the body&#x27;s momentum, the Hamiltonian is
formula_119
In this example, Hamilton&#x27;s equations are
formula_120
and
formula_121
Evaluating these partial derivatives, the former equation becomes
formula_122
which reproduces the familiar statement that a body&#x27;s momentum is the product of its mass and velocity. The time derivative of the momentum is
formula_123
which, upon identifying the negative derivative of the potential with the force, is just Newton&#x27;s second law once again.

As in the Lagrangian formulation, in Hamiltonian mechanics the conservation of momentum can be derived using Noether&#x27;s theorem, making Newton&#x27;s third law an idea that is deduced rather than assumed.

Among the proposals to reform the standard introductory-physics curriculum is one that teaches the concept of energy before that of force, essentially &quot;introductory Hamiltonian mechanics&quot;.

===Hamilton–Jacobi===
The Hamilton–Jacobi equation provides yet another formulation of classical mechanics, one which makes it mathematically analogous to wave optics. This formulation also uses Hamiltonian functions, but in a different way than the formulation described above. The paths taken by bodies or collections of bodies are deduced from a function formula_124 of positions formula_125 and time formula_126. The Hamiltonian is incorporated into the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, a differential equation for formula_127. Bodies move over time in such a way that their trajectories are perpendicular to the surfaces of constant formula_127, analogously to how a light ray propagates in the direction perpendicular to its wavefront. This is simplest to express for the case of a single point mass, in which formula_127 is a function formula_130, and the point mass moves in the direction along which formula_127 changes most steeply. In other words, the momentum of the point mass is the gradient of formula_127:
formula_133
The Hamilton–Jacobi equation for a point mass is
formula_134
The relation to Newton&#x27;s laws can be seen by considering a point mass moving in a time-independent potential formula_135, in which case the Hamilton–Jacobi equation becomes
formula_136
Taking the gradient of both sides, this becomes
formula_137
Interchanging the order of the partial derivatives on the left-hand side, and using the power and chain rules on the first term on the right-hand side,
formula_138
Gathering together the terms that depend upon the gradient of formula_127,
formula_140
This is another re-expression of Newton&#x27;s second law. The expression in brackets is a &quot;total&quot; or &quot;material&quot; derivative as mentioned above, in which the first term indicates how the function being differentiated changes over time at a fixed location, and the second term captures how a moving particle will see different values of that function as it travels from place to place:

==Relation to other physical theories==
===Thermodynamics and statistical physics===

In statistical physics, the kinetic theory of gases applies Newton&#x27;s laws of motion to large numbers (typically on the order of the Avogadro number) of particles. Kinetic theory can explain, for example, the pressure that a gas exerts upon the container holding it as the aggregate of many impacts of atoms, each imparting a tiny amount of momentum.

The Langevin equation is a special case of Newton&#x27;s second law, adapted for the case of describing a small object bombarded stochastically by even smaller ones. It can be writtenformula_142where formula_143 is a drag coefficient and formula_144 is a force that varies randomly from instant to instant, representing the net effect of collisions with the surrounding particles. This is used to model Brownian motion.

===Electromagnetism===
Newton&#x27;s three laws can be applied to phenomena involving electricity and magnetism, though subtleties and caveats exist.

Coulomb&#x27;s law for the electric force between two stationary, electrically charged bodies has much the same mathematical form as Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation: the force is proportional to the product of the charges, inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, and directed along the straight line between them. The Coulomb force that a charge formula_145 exerts upon a charge formula_146 is equal in magnitude to the force that formula_146 exerts upon formula_145, and it points in the exact opposite direction. Coulomb&#x27;s law is thus consistent with Newton&#x27;s third law.

Electromagnetism treats forces as produced by &quot;fields&quot; acting upon charges. The Lorentz force law provides an expression for the force upon a charged body that can be plugged into Newton&#x27;s second law in order to calculate its acceleration. According to the Lorentz force law, a charged body in an electric field experiences a force in the direction of that field, a force proportional to its charge formula_107 and to the strength of the electric field. In addition, a &quot;moving&quot; charged body in a magnetic field experiences a force that is also proportional to its charge, in a direction perpendicular to both the field and the body&#x27;s direction of motion. Using the vector cross product,formula_150
If the electric field vanishes (formula_151), then the force will be perpendicular to the charge&#x27;s motion, just as in the case of uniform circular motion studied above, and the charge will circle (or more generally move in a helix) around the magnetic field lines at the cyclotron frequency formula_152. Mass spectrometry works by applying electric and/or magnetic fields to moving charges and measuring the resulting acceleration, which by the Lorentz force law yields the mass-to-charge ratio.

Collections of charged bodies do not always obey Newton&#x27;s third law: there can be a change of one body&#x27;s momentum without a compensatory change in the momentum of another. The discrepancy is accounted for by momentum carried by the electromagnetic field itself. The momentum per unit volume of the electromagnetic field is proportional to the Poynting vector.

There is subtle conceptual conflict between electromagnetism and Newton&#x27;s first law: Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism predicts that electromagnetic waves will travel through empty space at a constant, definite speed. Thus, some inertial observers seemingly have a privileged status over the others, namely those who measure the speed of light and find it to be the value predicted by the Maxwell equations. In other words, light provides an absolute standard for speed, yet the principle of inertia holds that there should be no such standard. This tension is resolved in the theory of special relativity, which revises the notions of &quot;space&quot; and &quot;time&quot; in such a way that all inertial observers will agree upon the speed of light in vacuum.

===Special relativity===

In special relativity, the rule that Wilczek called &quot;Newton&#x27;s Zeroth Law&quot; breaks down: the mass of a composite object is not merely the sum of the masses of the individual pieces. Newton&#x27;s first law, inertial motion, remains true. A form of Newton&#x27;s second law, that force is the rate of change of momentum, also holds, as does the conservation of momentum. However, the definition of momentum is modified. Among the consequences of this is the fact that the more quickly a body moves, the harder it is to accelerate, and so, no matter how much force is applied, a body cannot be accelerated to the speed of light. Depending on the problem at hand, momentum in special relativity can be represented as a three-dimensional vector, formula_153, where formula_27 is the body&#x27;s rest mass and formula_143 is the Lorentz factor, which depends upon the body&#x27;s speed. Alternatively, momentum and force can be represented as four-vectors.

Newton&#x27;s third law must be modified in special relativity. The third law refers to the forces between two bodies at the same moment in time, and a key feature of special relativity is that simultaneity is relative. Events that happen at the same time relative to one observer can happen at different times relative to another. So, in a given observer&#x27;s frame of reference, action and reaction may not be exactly opposite, and the total momentum of interacting bodies may not be conserved. The conservation of momentum is restored by including the momentum stored in the field that describes the bodies&#x27; interaction.

Newtonian mechanics is a good approximation to special relativity when the speeds involved are small compared to that of light.

===General relativity===
General relativity is a theory of gravity that advances beyond that of Newton. In general relativity, the gravitational force of Newtonian mechanics is reimagined as curvature of spacetime. A curved path like an orbit, attributed to a gravitational force in Newtonian mechanics, is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather the body&#x27;s attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses. A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes the theory: &quot;Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.&quot; Wheeler himself thought of this reciprocal relationship as a modern, generalized form of Newton&#x27;s third law. The relation between matter distribution and spacetime curvature is given by the Einstein field equations, which require tensor calculus to express.

The Newtonian theory of gravity is a good approximation to the predictions of general relativity when gravitational effects are weak and objects are moving slowly compared to the speed of light.

===Quantum mechanics===
Quantum mechanics is a theory of physics originally developed in order to understand microscopic phenomena: behavior at the scale of molecules, atoms or subatomic particles. Generally and loosely speaking, the smaller a system is, the more an adequate mathematical model will require understanding quantum effects. The conceptual underpinning of quantum physics is very different from that of classical physics. Instead of thinking about quantities like position, momentum, and energy as properties that an object &quot;has&quot;, one considers what result might &quot;appear&quot; when a measurement of a chosen type is performed. Quantum mechanics allows the physicist to calculate the probability that a chosen measurement will elicit a particular result. The expectation value for a measurement is the average of the possible results it might yield, weighted by their probabilities of occurrence.

The Ehrenfest theorem provides a connection between quantum expectation values and Newton&#x27;s second law, a connection that is necessarily inexact, as quantum physics is fundamentally different from classical. In quantum physics, position and momentum are represented by mathematical entities known as Hermitian operators, and the Born rule is used to calculate the expectation values of a position measurement or a momentum measurement. These expectation values will generally change over time; that is, depending on the time at which (for example) a position measurement is performed, the probabilities for its different possible outcomes will vary. The Ehrenfest theorem says, roughly speaking, that the equations describing how these expectation values change over time have a form reminiscent of Newton&#x27;s second law. However, the more pronounced quantum effects are in a given situation, the more difficult it is to derive meaningful conclusions from this resemblance.

==History==
The concepts invoked in Newton&#x27;s laws of motion — mass, velocity, momentum, force — have predecessors in earlier work, and the content of Newtonian physics was further developed after Newton&#x27;s time. Newton combined knowledge of celestial motions with the study of events on Earth and showed that one theory of mechanics could encompass both.

As noted by scholar I. Bernard Cohen, Newton&#x27;s work was more than a mere synthesis of previous results, as he selected certain ideas and further transformed them, with each in a new form that was useful to him, while at the same time proving false of certain basic or fundamental principles of scientists such as Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, René Descartes, and Nicolaus Copernicus. He approached natural philosophy with mathematics in a completely novel way, in that instead of a preconceived natural philosophy, his style was to begin with a mathematical construct, and build on from there, comparing it to the real world to show that his system accurately accounted for it.

=== Antiquity and medieval background ===

==== Aristotle and &quot;violent&quot; motion ====

The subject of physics is often traced back to Aristotle, but the history of the concepts involved is obscured by multiple factors. An exact correspondence between Aristotelian and modern concepts is not simple to establish: Aristotle did not clearly distinguish what we would call speed and force, used the same term for density and viscosity, and conceived of motion as always through a medium, rather than through space. In addition, some concepts often termed &quot;Aristotelian&quot; might better be attributed to his followers and commentators upon him. These commentators found that Aristotelian physics had difficulty explaining projectile motion. Aristotle divided motion into two types: &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;violent&quot;. The &quot;natural&quot; motion of terrestrial solid matter was to fall downwards, whereas a &quot;violent&quot; motion could push a body sideways. Moreover, in Aristotelian physics, a &quot;violent&quot; motion requires an immediate cause; separated from the cause of its &quot;violent&quot; motion, a body would revert to its &quot;natural&quot; behavior. Yet, a javelin continues moving after it leaves the thrower&#x27;s hand. Aristotle concluded that the air around the javelin must be imparted with the ability to move the javelin forward. 

==== Philoponus and impetus ====
John Philoponus, a Byzantine Greek thinker active during the sixth century, found this absurd: the same medium, air, was somehow responsible both for sustaining motion and for impeding it. If Aristotle&#x27;s idea were true, Philoponus said, armies would launch weapons by blowing upon them with bellows. Philoponus argued that setting a body into motion imparted a quality, impetus, that would be contained within the body itself. As long as its impetus was sustained, the body would continue to move. In the following centuries, versions of impetus theory were advanced by individuals including Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji, Avicenna, Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī, John Buridan, and Albert of Saxony. In retrospect, the idea of impetus can be seen as a forerunner of the modern concept of momentum. The intuition that objects move according to some kind of impetus persists in many students of introductory physics.

=== Inertia and the first law ===

The French philosopher René Descartes introduced the concept of inertia by way of his &quot;laws of nature&quot; in &quot;The World&quot; (&quot;Traité du monde et de la lumière&quot;) written 1629–33. However, &quot;The World&quot; purported a heliocentric worldview, and in 1633 this view had given rise a great conflict between Galileo Galilei and the Roman Catholic Inquisition. Descartes knew about this controversy and did not wish to get involved. &quot;The World&quot; was not published until 1664, ten years after his death.
The modern concept of inertia is credited to Galileo. Based on his experiments, Galileo concluded that the &quot;natural&quot; behavior of a moving body was to keep moving, until something else interfered with it. In &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; (1638) Galileo wrote:Galileo recognized that in projectile motion, the Earth&#x27;s gravity affects vertical but not horizontal motion. However, Galileo&#x27;s idea of inertia was not exactly the one that would be codified into Newton&#x27;s first law. Galileo thought that a body moving a long distance inertially would follow the curve of the Earth. This idea was corrected by Isaac Beeckman, Descartes, and Pierre Gassendi, who recognized that inertial motion should be motion in a straight line. Descartes published his laws of nature (laws of motion) with this correction in &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; (&quot;Principia Philosophiae&quot;) in 1644, with the heliocentric part toned down.

According to American philosopher Richard J. Blackwell, Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens had worked out his own, concise version of the law in 1656. It was not published until 1703, eight years after his death, in the opening paragraph of &quot;De Motu Corporum ex Percussione&quot;.

According to Huygens, this law was already known by Galileo and Descartes among others.

=== Force and the second law ===

Christiaan Huygens, in his &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot; (1673), put forth the hypothesis that &quot;By the action of gravity, whatever its sources, it happens that bodies are moved by a motion composed both of a uniform motion in one direction or another and of a motion downward due to gravity.&quot; Newton&#x27;s second law generalized this hypothesis from gravity to all forces.

One important characteristic of Newtonian physics is that forces can act at a distance without requiring physical contact. For example, the Sun and the Earth pull on each other gravitationally, despite being separated by millions of kilometres. This contrasts with the idea, championed by Descartes among others, that the Sun&#x27;s gravity held planets in orbit by swirling them in a vortex of transparent matter, &quot;aether&quot;. Newton considered aetherial explanations of force but ultimately rejected them. The study of magnetism by William Gilbert and others created a precedent for thinking of &quot;immaterial&quot; forces, and unable to find a quantitatively satisfactory explanation of his law of gravity in terms of an aetherial model, Newton eventually declared, &quot;I feign no hypotheses&quot;: whether or not a model like Descartes&#x27;s vortices could be found to underlie the &quot;Principia&quot;&#x27;s theories of motion and gravity, the first grounds for judging them must be the successful predictions they made. And indeed, since Newton&#x27;s time every attempt at such a model has failed.

=== Momentum conservation and the third law ===

Johannes Kepler suggested that gravitational attractions were reciprocal — that, for example, the Moon pulls on the Earth while the Earth pulls on the Moon — but he did not argue that such pairs are equal and opposite. In his &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; (1644), Descartes introduced the idea that during a collision between bodies, a &quot;quantity of motion&quot; remains unchanged. Descartes defined this quantity somewhat imprecisely by adding up the products of the speed and &quot;size&quot; of each body, where &quot;size&quot; for him incorporated both volume and surface area. Moreover, Descartes thought of the universe as a plenum, that is, filled with matter, so all motion required a body to displace a medium as it moved. 

During the 1650s, Huygens studied collisions between hard spheres and deduced a principle that is now identified as the conservation of momentum. Christopher Wren would later deduce the same rules for elastic collisions that Huygens had, and John Wallis would apply momentum conservation to study inelastic collisions. Newton cited the work of Huygens, Wren, and Wallis to support the validity of his third law.

Newton arrived at his set of three laws incrementally. In a 1684 manuscript written to Huygens, he listed four laws: the principle of inertia, the change of motion by force, a statement about relative motion that would today be called Galilean invariance, and the rule that interactions between bodies do not change the motion of their center of mass. In a later manuscript, Newton added a law of action and reaction, while saying that this law and the law regarding the center of mass implied one another. Newton probably settled on the presentation in the &quot;Principia,&quot; with three primary laws and then other statements reduced to corollaries, during 1685.

=== After the &quot;Principia&quot; ===

Newton expressed his second law by saying that the force on a body is proportional to its change of motion, or momentum. By the time he wrote the &quot;Principia,&quot; he had already developed calculus (which he called &quot;the science of fluxions&quot;), but in the &quot;Principia&quot; he made no explicit use of it, perhaps because he believed geometrical arguments in the tradition of Euclid to be more rigorous. Consequently, the &quot;Principia&quot; does not express acceleration as the second derivative of position, and so it does not give the second law as formula_156. This form of the second law was written (for the special case of constant force) at least as early as 1716, by Jakob Hermann; Leonhard Euler would employ it as a basic premise in the 1740s. Euler pioneered the study of rigid bodies and established the basic theory of fluid dynamics. Pierre-Simon Laplace&#x27;s five-volume &quot;Traité de mécanique céleste&quot; (1798–1825) forsook geometry and developed mechanics purely through algebraic expressions, while resolving questions that the &quot;Principia&quot; had left open, like a full theory of the tides.

The concept of energy became a key part of Newtonian mechanics in the post-Newton period. Huygens&#x27; solution of the collision of hard spheres showed that in that case, not only is momentum conserved, but kinetic energy is as well (or, rather, a quantity that in retrospect we can identify as one-half the total kinetic energy). The question of what is conserved during all other processes, like inelastic collisions and motion slowed by friction, was not resolved until the 19th century. Debates on this topic overlapped with philosophical disputes between the metaphysical views of Newton and Leibniz, and variants of the term &quot;force&quot; were sometimes used to denote what we would call types of energy. For example, in 1742, Émilie du Châtelet wrote, &quot;Dead force consists of a simple tendency to motion: such is that of a spring ready to relax; living force is that which a body has when it is in actual motion.&quot; In modern terminology, &quot;dead force&quot; and &quot;living force&quot; correspond to potential energy and kinetic energy respectively. Conservation of energy was not established as a universal principle until it was understood that the energy of mechanical work can be dissipated into heat. With the concept of energy given a solid grounding, Newton&#x27;s laws could then be derived within formulations of classical mechanics that put energy first, as in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations described above.

Modern presentations of Newton&#x27;s laws use the mathematics of vectors, a topic that was not developed until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Vector algebra, pioneered by Josiah Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside, stemmed from and largely supplanted the earlier system of quaternions invented by William Rowan Hamilton.

<text>Timothy Julian Brooke-Taylor OBE (17 July 194012 April 2020) was an English actor and comedian. He was best known as a member of The Goodies.

He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at the University of Cambridge and became president of the Footlights, touring internationally with its revue in 1964. Becoming more widely known to the public for his work on BBC Radio with &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;, he moved into television with &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;, working together with old Cambridge friends John Cleese and Graham Chapman. With Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, he starred in &quot;The Goodies&quot; (1970–1982), picking up international recognition in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. He appeared as an actor in various sitcoms and was a panellist on BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; for almost 50 years.

==Early life and education==
Timothy Julian Brooke-Taylor was born on 17 July 1940 in Buxton, Derbyshire, son of Edward Brooke-Taylor, a solicitor and games teacher and international lacrosse player and Rachel, daughter of Francis Pawson, a parson who played centre forward for the English football team in the 1880s. He was expelled from primary school at the early age of five and a half. Brooke-Taylor was then schooled at Thorn Leigh Pre-Preparatory School, Holm Leigh Preparatory School (where he won a cup for his prowess as a bowler in the school cricket team) and Winchester College which he left with seven O-levels and two A-levels in English and history.

After teaching for a year at Lockers Park School, a preparatory school in Hemel Hempstead and a term back at Holm Leigh School as a teacher, he studied at Pembroke College, Cambridge. There he read economics and politics before changing to read law and mixed with other budding comedians, including John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Bill Oddie, Graeme Garden and Jonathan Lynn in the Cambridge University Footlights Club (of which Brooke-Taylor became president in 1963).

The Footlights Club revue, &quot;A Clump of Plinths&quot;, was so successful during its Edinburgh Festival Fringe run that the show was renamed as &quot;Cambridge Circus&quot; and transferred to the West End in London before being taken to both New Zealand and Broadway in the United States in September 1964. Brooke-Taylor was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the Pembroke Players.

==Career==
Brooke-Taylor moved swiftly into BBC Radio with the fast-paced comedy show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; which he performed in and co-wrote. As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely catchphrase &quot;Did somebody call?&quot; uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or cliffhanger ending. Other members of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; were John Cleese, Bill Oddie, Graeme Garden, David Hatch and Jo Kendall.

In the mid-1960s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the television series &quot;On the Braden Beat&quot; with Canadian Bernard Braden, taking over the slot recently vacated by Peter Cook in his guise as E. L. Wisty. Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary City gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.

In 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;, with John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman. The &quot;Four Yorkshiremen&quot; sketch was co-written by the four writers and performers of the series. The sketch appears on the DVD of &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;. Footage of Brooke-Taylor and Cleese from &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; was shown on the documentary special &quot;Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)&quot;. The sketch has since become known for its satirical depiction of Britain&#x27;s class system and North-South divide.

Brooke-Taylor also took part in David Frost&#x27;s pilot programme &quot;How to Irritate People&quot; in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the Monty Python style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, such as the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also the first collaboration between Cleese and Michael Palin. One of the sketches referred to Cleese&#x27;s character dating a promiscuous woman named &quot;Christine Wheadon&quot;, which was the name of Brooke-Taylor&#x27;s wife.

Also in 1968, Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot;, filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week. The episode he was in still survives and has been included in DVD compilation sets.

In 1968–69, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series &quot;Marty&quot; starring Marty Feldman, with John Junkin and Roland MacLeod. A compilation of the two series of &quot;Marty&quot; has been released on a BBC DVD entitled &quot;The Best of Marty Feldman&quot;. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film &quot;One Man Band&quot; directed by Orson Welles; however, the project was never completed and remains unreleased.

At around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of &quot;Broaden Your Mind&quot; with Garden (and Oddie joining for the second series). Describing itself as &quot;An Encyclopedia of the Air&quot;, the show was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme.

The success of &quot;Broaden Your Mind&quot; led to the commissioning of &quot;The Goodies&quot;, also with Oddie and Garden. First transmitted on BBC2 in November 1970, &quot;The Goodies&quot; was a television success, broadcast for over a decade by both the BBC and (in its final year) by ITV contractor London Weekend Television, spawning many spin-off books and successful records.

During the run of &quot;The Goodies&quot;, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series &quot;Hello Cheeky&quot;, a bawdy stand-up comedy show also starring Barry Cryer and John Junkin. The series transferred to television briefly, produced for ITV by the commercial franchise Yorkshire Television.

He appeared on television in British sitcoms, including &quot;You Must Be the Husband&quot; with Diane Keen, &quot;His and Hers&quot; with Madeline Smith and &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; with Richard O&#x27;Sullivan. He also starred in the Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Tell Me Where It Hurts&quot; in 1979. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores and in a public information film for the now-defunct E111 form, since replaced by the European Health Insurance Card.

In 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After &quot;The Goodies&quot; on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the television animated comedy series &quot;Bananaman&quot;, in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Gideon&quot;.

Brooke-Taylor appeared in Amnesty International shows: in &quot;A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)&quot; he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;, whilst in &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; he took part in the sketches &quot;Top of the Form&quot; (with Cleese, Chapman, John Bird, John Fortune, Rowan Atkinson and Griff Rhys Jones), and &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot; (with Cleese and Chapman). Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie also appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to perform &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;. Garden joined Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production of &quot;The Unvarnished Truth&quot;.

Other BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled &quot;antidote to panel games&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, which started in 1972; he took part regularly for over 40 years. On 18 February 1981, Brooke-Taylor, was the subject of Thames Television&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

In 1997, he appeared in a special episode of &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;.

In 1998, Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode of the political satire game show &quot;If I Ruled the World&quot;.

In 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Garden were co-presenters of Channel 4&#x27;s daytime game show, &quot;Beat the Nation&quot;, in which they indulged in typical game show &quot;banter&quot;, but took the quiz itself seriously. He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a middle class Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into pantomime as the Dame in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot;. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and cricket. His interest in golf came to the fore when he took part in the &quot;Pro-Celebrity Golf&quot; television series (opposite Bruce Forsyth), and appeared in the premiere episode of the BBC&#x27;s golf-based game show &quot;Full Swing&quot;.

In 2008, Brooke-Taylor was heard in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio story &quot;The Zygon Who Fell To Earth&quot;, made by Big Finish Productions. Paul McGann played the Eighth Doctor and Brooke-Taylor played the part of Mims, a Zygon taking the shape of a human.

Brooke-Taylor made his final public appearance when he attended the Bristol slapstick festival in January 2020, 3 months before his death.

==Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews==
Brooke-Taylor was elected Lord Rector by the students of the University of St Andrews and held office between 1979 and 1982. In this role he represented the students, chaired the University Court and presided over the General Council in the absence of the Chancellor. At his installation he arrived by helicopter, rode a motorbike and was hauled in an open carriage as part of The Drag. His installation speech included a mother-in-law joke in Latin and a suggestion his successor should be a woman; he was succeeded by Katherine Whitehorn who was elected unopposed as the university&#x27;s first female rector in 1982. Brooke-Taylor is remembered as an effective Rector who visited the town frequently, took the role seriously, wore a Saltire waistcoat while there and is said to have remarked that St Andrews was &quot;the happiest university&quot; he had been to. 

==Personal life and death==
Brooke-Taylor married Christine Wheadon in 1968 and they had two sons, Benjamin and Edward. He lived in Cookham Dean, Berkshire and was involved in local events. A keen golfer, he was a member of Temple Golf Club. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to light entertainment.

Brooke-Taylor died of complications from COVID-19 on 12 April 2020, aged 79, in Cookham, Berkshire. In tribute to Brooke-Taylor, the flag of his alma mater, Pembroke College, Cambridge, was lowered to half-mast the following day.

<text>The Great Artesian Basin (GAB) of Australia is the largest and deepest artesian basin in the world, extending over . Measured water temperatures range from . The basin provides the only source of fresh water through much of inland Australia.

The basin underlies 22% of the Australian continent, including most of Queensland, the south-east corner of the Northern Territory, north-eastern South Australia, and northern New South Wales. It is deep in places and is estimated to contain of groundwater. The Great Artesian Basin Coordinating Committee (GABCC) coordinates activity between federal, state/territory and local levels of government and community organisations.

==Physiography==
This area is one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger East Australian Basins division, and includes the smaller Wilcannia Threshold physiographic section.

===Geology===
The water of the Great Artesian Basin is held in a sandstone layer laid down by continental erosion of higher ground during the Triassic, Jurassic, and early Cretaceous periods. During a time when much of what is now inland Australia was below sea level, the sandstone was covered by a layer of marine sedimentary rock, which formed a confining layer that trapped water in the sandstone aquifer. The eastern edge of the basin was uplifted when the Great Dividing Range formed. The other side was created from the landforms of the Central Eastern Lowlands and the Great Western Plateau to the west.

Most recharge water enters the rock formations from relatively high ground near the eastern edge of the basin (in Queensland and New South Wales) and very gradually flows toward the south and west. A much smaller amount enters along the western margin in arid central Australia, flowing to the south and east through the permeable sandstone, at a rate of one to five metres per year.

Discharge water eventually exits through a number of springs and seeps, mostly in the southern part of the basin. The age of the groundwater, determined by carbon-14 and chlorine-36 measurements combined with hydraulic modelling, ranges from several thousand years for the recharge areas in the north to nearly 2 million years in the south-western discharge zones.

===Water source===
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, waters of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) discharged through mound springs, many in arid South Australia, such as Witjira-Dalhousie Springs. These springs sustained a variety of endemic invertebrates, such as molluscs, and supported extensive Aboriginal communities and trade routes. After the arrival of Europeans, the springs facilitated exploration, and allowed the provision of faster communications between south-eastern Australia and Europe, via the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. The Great Artesian Basin became an important water supply for cattle stations, irrigation, and livestock and domestic purposes, and is a vital life line for rural Australia. To tap it, boreholes are drilled down to a suitable rock layer, and the pressure of the water often forces it up without the need for pumps.

The discovery and use of the water in the Great Artesian Basin allowed the settlement of thousands of square kilometres of country away from rivers in inland New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia, that would otherwise have been unavailable for pastoral activities. European discovery of the basin dates from 1878 when a shallow bore near Bourke produced flowing water. There were similar discoveries in 1886 at Back Creek east of Barcaldine, and in 1887 near Cunnamulla.

In essence, water extraction from the GAB is a mining operation, with recharge much less than current extraction rates. In 1915, there were 1,500 bores providing of water per day, but today the total output has dropped to per day. This included just under 2,000 freely-flowing bores and more than 9,000 that required mechanical power to bring water to the surface. Many bores are unregulated or abandoned, resulting in considerable water wastage. These problems have existed for many decades, and in January 2007 the Australian Commonwealth Government announced additional funding in an attempt to bring them under control. However, many of the mound springs referred to above have dried up due to a drop in water pressure, probably resulting in extinction of several invertebrate species.

The Olympic Dam mine in South Australia is permitted to extract up to of water daily from the Great Artesian Basin under the &quot;Roxby Downs (Indenture Ratification) Act 1982&quot;. The underground copper and uranium mine commenced operations in 1988 and is expected to continue operating until approximately 2060.

In addition, the Basin provides water, via a bore, for a geothermal power station at Birdsville. Water emerges from the bore at and provides 25% of the town&#x27;s electricity needs. After being cooled, the water is also the source of the town&#x27;s drinking water.

==Whole of Basin management==
The Great Artesian Basin underlies parts of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory, which each operate under different legislative frameworks, policies and resource management approaches. In 2020 the Australian government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water published the Great Artesian Basin Strategic Management Plan, which was prepared together with the individual governments and in consultation with the GABCC, stakeholders and public feedback.

The Great Artesian Basin Coordinating Committee (GABCC) provides advice from community organisations and agencies to state, territory and Australian government ministers on efficient, effective and sustainable whole-of-Basin resource management and to coordinate activity between stakeholders.

Membership of the Committee comprises all state, territory, and Australian government agencies with responsibilities for management of parts of the Great Artesian Basin, community representatives nominated by agencies; and sector representatives.

== Environmental concerns ==
In 2011, ABC TV&#x27;s public affairs program &quot;Four Corners&quot; revealed that significant concerns were being expressed about depletion and chemical damage to the Basin as a result of coal seam gas extraction. In one incident, reported in the program, the Queensland Gas Company (QGC) &quot;fracked&quot; its Myrtle 3 well connecting the Springbok aquifer to the coal seam below (the Walloon Coal Measures) in 2009. A local farmer was concerned that the process might have released of a potentially toxic chemical into the Basin. QGC admitted the incident, but &quot;did not alert authorities or nearby water users about the problem until thirteen months after the incident&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au-2011-02-21/farmers-count1951670&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The safety data sheet QGC had submitted for the hydraulic fracturing chemical was derived from the United States, incomplete and ten years out of date.

Over thirty chemicals may be used in the process of hydraulic fracturing and their long-term impact on aquifers, agriculture and people supported by them has been quantifiable and verified for quite some time. Lead, aluminium, arsenic, barium, boron, nickel and uranium have all been found beyond recommended levels in the groundwater contaminated by coal seam gas. Instances of groundwater being contaminated and by extension poisoning the ecosystems sustained by the availability of groundwater have been widely documented, and are an exacerbating factor in regards to the population&#x27;s capability to cope with drought through usage of groundwater sources in Australia.

Glencore planned to inject up to 110,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year into a groundwater formation in the basin. Hydrogeologist Ned Hamer stated that the carbon dioxide would increase the acidity of the water to the extent that it would dissolve the rock, releasing heavy metals into the water and making it unusable. After producer advocacy group AgForce took the Federal Government along with Glencore to court, the Queensland Government rejected the proposal in May 2024, and subsequently banned carbon capture and storage using the Great Artesian Basin.

<doc id="55216" wikidata="Q316544" url="?curid=55216" title="Anders Hejlsberg">
<text>Anders Hejlsberg (, born 2 December 1960) is a Danish software engineer who co-designed several programming languages and development tools. He was the original author of Turbo Pascal and the chief architect of Delphi. He currently works for Microsoft as the lead architect of C# and core developer on TypeScript.

== Early life ==
Hejlsberg was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, and studied Electrical Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark. While at the university in 1980, he began writing programs for the Nascom microcomputer, including a Pascal compiler which was initially marketed as the &quot;Blue Label Software Pascal&quot; for the Nascom-2. However, he soon rewrote it for CP/M and DOS, marketing it first as &quot;Compas Pascal&quot; and later as &quot;PolyPascal&quot;. Later the product was licensed to Borland, and integrated into an IDE to become the Turbo Pascal system. Turbo Pascal competed with PolyPascal. The compiler itself was largely inspired by the &quot;Tiny Pascal&quot; compiler in Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s &quot;Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs&quot;, one of the most influential computer science books of the time.

== At Borland ==
In Borland&#x27;s hands, Turbo Pascal became one of the most commercially successful Pascal compilers. Hejlsberg remained with PolyData until the company came under financial stress and in 1989 he moved to California to become Chief Engineer at Borland. During this time, he developed Turbo Pascal further and became the chief architect for the team that produced Borland Delphi, which replaced Turbo Pascal.

== At Microsoft ==

In 1996, Hejlsberg left Borland and joined Microsoft. One of his first achievements was the J++ programming language and the Windows Foundation Classes; he also became a Microsoft Distinguished Engineer and Technical Fellow. Since 2000, he has been the lead architect of the team developing the C# language. In 2012 Hejlsberg announced a new Microsoft project, TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript.

== Awards ==
Hejlsberg received the 2001 Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Excellence in Programming Award for his work on Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C# and the Microsoft .NET Framework.

Together with Shon Katzenberger, Scott Wiltamuth, Todd Proebsting, Erik Meijer, Peter Hallam, and Peter Sollich, Anders was awarded a Technical Recognition Award for Outstanding Technical Achievement for their work on the C# language in 2007.

<doc id="55222" wikidata="Q1075376" url="?curid=55222" title="Buckminsterfullerene">
<text>Buckminsterfullerene is a type of fullerene with the formula C60. It has a cage-like fused-ring structure (truncated icosahedron) made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, and resembles a soccer ball. Each of its 60 carbon atoms is bonded to its three neighbors. 

Buckminsterfullerene is a black solid that dissolves in hydrocarbon solvents to produce a violet solution. The substance was discovered in 1985 and has received intense study, although few real world applications have been found.

Molecules of buckminsterfullerene (or of fullerenes in general) are commonly nicknamed buckyballs.

==Occurrence==
Buckminsterfullerene is the most common naturally occurring fullerene. Small quantities of it can be found in soot. 

It also exists in space. Neutral C60 has been observed in planetary nebulae and several types of star. The ionised form, C60+, has been identified in the interstellar medium, where it is the cause of several absorption features known as diffuse interstellar bands in the near-infrared. 

==History==


Theoretical predictions of buckminsterfullerene molecules appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was first generated in 1984 by Eric Rohlfing, Donald Cox, and Andrew Kaldor using a laser to vaporize carbon in a supersonic helium beam, although the group did not realize that buckminsterfullerene had been produced. In 1985 their work was repeated by Harold Kroto, James R. Heath, Sean C. O&#x27;Brien, Robert Curl, and Richard Smalley at Rice University, who recognized the structure of C60 as buckminsterfullerene.

Concurrent but unconnected to the Kroto-Smalley work, astrophysicists were working with spectroscopists to study infrared emissions from giant red carbon stars. Smalley and team were able to use a laser vaporization technique to create carbon clusters which could potentially emit infrared at the same wavelength as had been emitted by the red carbon star. Hence, the inspiration came to Smalley and team to use the laser technique on graphite to generate fullerenes.

Using laser evaporation of graphite the Smalley team found C&quot;n&quot; clusters (where and even) of which the most common were C60 and C70. A solid rotating graphite disk was used as the surface from which carbon was vaporized using a laser beam creating hot plasma that was then passed through a stream of high-density helium gas. The carbon species were subsequently cooled and ionized resulting in the formation of clusters. Clusters ranged in molecular masses, but Kroto and Smalley found predominance in a C60 cluster that could be enhanced further by allowing the plasma to react longer. They also discovered that C60 is a cage-like molecule, a regular truncated icosahedron.

The experimental evidence, a strong peak at 720 atomic mass units, indicated that a carbon molecule with 60 carbon atoms was forming, but provided no structural information. The research group concluded after reactivity experiments, that the most likely structure was a spheroidal molecule. The idea was quickly rationalized as the basis of an icosahedral symmetry closed cage structure.

Kroto, Curl, and Smalley were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their roles in the discovery of buckminsterfullerene and the related class of molecules, the fullerenes.

In 1989 physicists Wolfgang Krätschmer, Konstantinos Fostiropoulos, and Donald R. Huffman observed unusual optical absorptions in thin films of carbon dust (soot). The soot had been generated by an arc-process between two graphite electrodes in a helium atmosphere where the electrode material evaporates and condenses forming soot in the quenching atmosphere. Among other features, the IR spectra of the soot showed four discrete bands in close agreement to those proposed for C60.

Another paper on the characterization and verification of the molecular structure followed on in the same year (1990) from their thin film experiments, and detailed also the extraction of an evaporable as well as benzene-soluble material from the arc-generated soot. This extract had TEM and X-ray crystal analysis consistent with arrays of spherical C60 molecules, approximately 1.0 nm in van der Waals diameter as well as the expected molecular mass of 720 Da for C60 (and 840 Da for C70) in their mass spectra. The method was simple and efficient to prepare the material in gram amounts per day (1990) which has boosted the fullerene research and is even today applied for the commercial production of fullerenes.

The discovery of practical routes to C60 led to the exploration of a new field of chemistry involving the study of fullerenes.

===Etymology===
The discoverers of the allotrope named the newfound molecule after American architect R. Buckminster Fuller, who designed many geodesic dome structures that look similar to C60 and who had died in 1983, the year before discovery. Another common name for buckminsterfullerene is &quot;buckyballs&quot;.

==Synthesis==
Soot is produced by laser ablation of graphite or pyrolysis of aromatic hydrocarbons. Fullerenes are extracted from the soot with organic solvents using a Soxhlet extractor. This step yields a solution containing up to 75% of C60, as well as other fullerenes. These fractions are separated using chromatography. Generally, the fullerenes are dissolved in a hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon and separated using alumina columns.

==Structure==
Buckminsterfullerene is a truncated icosahedron with 60 vertices, 32 faces (20 hexagons and 12 pentagons where no pentagons share a vertex), and 90 edges (60 edges between 5-membered &amp; 6-membered rings and 30 edges are shared between 6-membered &amp; 6-membered rings), with a carbon atom at the vertices of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge. The van der Waals diameter of a molecule is about 1.01 nanometers (nm). The nucleus to nucleus diameter of a molecule is about 0.71 nm. The molecule has two bond lengths. The 6:6 ring bonds (between two hexagons) can be considered &quot;double bonds&quot; and are shorter than the 6:5 bonds (between a hexagon and a pentagon). Its average bond length is 0.14 nm. Each carbon atom in the structure is bonded covalently with 3 others. A carbon atom in the can be substituted by a nitrogen or boron atom yielding a or C59B respectively.

==Properties==

For a time buckminsterfullerene was the largest known molecule observed to exhibit wave–particle duality. In 2020 the dye molecule phthalocyanine exhibited the duality that is more famously attributed to light, electrons and other small particles and molecules.

===Solution===

Fullerenes are sparingly soluble in aromatic solvents and carbon disulfide, but insoluble in water. Solutions of pure C60 have a deep purple color which leaves a brown residue upon evaporation. The reason for this color change is the relatively narrow energy width of the band of molecular levels responsible for green light absorption by individual C60 molecules. Thus individual molecules transmit some blue and red light resulting in a purple color. Upon drying, intermolecular interaction results in the overlap and broadening of the energy bands, thereby eliminating the blue light transmittance and causing the purple to brown color change.

 crystallises with some solvents in the lattice (&quot;solvates&quot;). For example, crystallization of C60 from benzene solution yields triclinic crystals with the formula C60·4C6H6. Like other solvates, this one readily releases benzene to give the usual face-centred cubic C60. Millimeter-sized crystals of C60 and can be grown from solution both for solvates and for pure fullerenes.

===Solid===
In solid buckminsterfullerene, the C60 molecules adopt the fcc (face-centered cubic) motif. They start rotating at about −20 °C. This change is associated with a first-order phase transition to an fcc structure and a small, yet abrupt increase in the lattice constant from 1.411 to 1.4154 nm.

 solid is as soft as graphite, but when compressed to less than 70% of its volume it transforms into a superhard form of diamond (see aggregated diamond nanorod). films and solution have strong non-linear optical properties; in particular, their optical absorption increases with light intensity (saturable absorption).

 forms a brownish solid with an optical absorption threshold at ≈1.6 eV. It is an n-type semiconductor with a low activation energy of 0.1–0.3 eV; this conductivity is attributed to intrinsic or oxygen-related defects. Fcc C60 contains voids at its octahedral and tetrahedral sites which are sufficiently large (0.6 and 0.2 nm respectively) to accommodate impurity atoms. When alkali metals are doped into these voids, C60 converts from a semiconductor into a conductor or even superconductor.

==Chemical reactions and properties==
===Redox (electron-transfer reactions)===
 undergoes six reversible, one-electron reductions, ultimately generating . Its oxidation is irreversible. The first reduction occurs at ≈-1.0 V (Fc/), showing that C60 is a reluctant electron acceptor. tends to avoid having double bonds in the pentagonal rings, which makes electron delocalization poor, and results in not being &quot;superaromatic&quot;. C60 behaves like an electron deficient alkene. For example, it reacts with some nucleophiles.

=== Hydrogenation ===
C60 exhibits a small degree of aromatic character, but it still reflects localized double and single C–C bond characters. Therefore, C60 can undergo addition with hydrogen to give polyhydrofullerenes. C60 also undergoes Birch reduction. For example, C60 reacts with lithium in liquid ammonia, followed by &quot;tert&quot;-butanol to give a mixture of polyhydrofullerenes such as C60H18, C60H32, C60H36, with C60H32 being the dominating product. This mixture of polyhydrofullerenes can be re-oxidized by 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone to give C60 again.

A selective hydrogenation method exists. Reaction of C60 with 9,9′,10,10′-dihydroanthracene under the same conditions, depending on the time of reaction, gives C60H32 and C60H18 respectively and selectively.

===Halogenation===
Addition of fluorine, chlorine, and bromine occurs for C60. Fluorine atoms are small enough for a 1,2-addition, while Cl2 and Br2 add to remote C atoms due to steric factors. For example, in C60Br8 and C60Br24, the Br atoms are in 1,3- or 1,4-positions with respect to each other. Under various conditions a vast number of halogenated derivatives of C60 can be produced, some with an extraordinary selectivity on one or two isomers over the other possible ones. Addition of fluorine and chlorine usually results in a flattening of the C60 framework into a drum-shaped molecule.

===Addition of oxygen atoms===
Solutions of C60 can be oxygenated to the epoxide C60O. Ozonation of C60 in 1,2-xylene at 257K gives an intermediate ozonide C60O3, which can be decomposed into 2 forms of C60O. Decomposition of C60O3 at 296 K gives the epoxide, but photolysis gives a product in which the O atom bridges a 5,6-edge.

===Cycloadditions===
The Diels–Alder reaction is commonly employed to functionalize C60. Reaction of C60 with appropriate substituted diene gives the corresponding adduct.

The Diels–Alder reaction between C60 and 3,6-diaryl-1,2,4,5-tetrazines affords C62. The C62 has the structure in which a four-membered ring is surrounded by four six-membered rings.

The C60 molecules can also be coupled through a [2+2] cycloaddition, giving the dumbbell-shaped compound C120. The coupling is achieved by high-speed vibrating milling of C60 with a catalytic amount of KCN. The reaction is reversible as C120 dissociates back to two C60 molecules when heated at . Under high pressure and temperature, repeated [2+2] cycloaddition between C60 results in polymerized fullerene chains and networks. These polymers remain stable at ambient pressure and temperature once formed, and have remarkably interesting electronic and magnetic properties, such as being ferromagnetic above room temperature.

===Free radical reactions===
Reactions of C60 with free radicals readily occur. When C60 is mixed with a disulfide RSSR, the radical C60SR• forms spontaneously upon irradiation of the mixture.

Stability of the radical species C60Y• depends largely on steric factors of Y. When &quot;tert&quot;-butyl halide is photolyzed and allowed to react with C60, a reversible inter-cage C–C bond is formed:

===Cyclopropanation (Bingel reaction)===
Cyclopropanation (the Bingel reaction) is another common method for functionalizing C60. Cyclopropanation of C60 mostly occurs at the junction of 2 hexagons due to steric factors.

The first cyclopropanation was carried out by treating the β-bromomalonate with C60 in the presence of a base. Cyclopropanation also occur readily with diazomethanes. For example, diphenyldiazomethane reacts readily with C60 to give the compound C61Ph2. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester derivative prepared through cyclopropanation has been studied for use in organic solar cells.

===Redox reactions – C60 anions and cations===
====C60 anions====

The LUMO in C60 is triply degenerate, with the HOMO–LUMO separation relatively small. This small gap suggests that reduction of C60 should occur at mild potentials leading to fulleride anions, [C60]&quot;n&quot;− (&quot;n&quot; = 1–6). The midpoint potentials of 1-electron reduction of buckminsterfullerene and its anions is given in the table below:

C60 forms a variety of charge-transfer complexes, for example with tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene:
:C60 + C2(NMe2)4 → [C2(NMe2)4]+[C60]−
This salt exhibits ferromagnetism at 16 K.

====C60 cations====
C60 oxidizes with difficulty. Three reversible oxidation processes have been observed by using cyclic voltammetry with ultra-dry methylene chloride and a supporting electrolyte with extremely high oxidation resistance and low nucleophilicity, such as [nBu4N] [AsF6].

===Metal complexes===

C60 forms complexes akin to the more common alkenes. Complexes have been reported molybdenum, tungsten, platinum, palladium, iridium, and titanium. The pentacarbonyl species are produced by photochemical reactions.

: M(CO)6 + C60 → M(&quot;η&quot;2-C60)(CO)5 + CO (M = Mo, W)

In the case of platinum complex, the labile ethylene ligand is the leaving group in a thermal reaction:
: Pt(&quot;η&quot;2-C2H4)(PPh3)2 + C60 → Pt(&quot;η&quot;2-C60)(PPh3)2 + C2H4

Titanocene complexes have also been reported:
: (&quot;η&quot;5-Cp)2Ti(&quot;η&quot;2-(CH3)3SiC≡CSi(CH3)3) + C60 → (&quot;η&quot;5-Cp)2Ti(&quot;η&quot;2-C60) + (CH3)3SiC≡CSi(CH3)3

Coordinatively unsaturated precursors, such as Vaska&#x27;s complex, for adducts with C60:

: &quot;trans&quot;-Ir(CO)Cl(PPh3)2 + C60 → Ir(CO)Cl(&quot;η&quot;2-C60)(PPh3)2

One such iridium complex, [Ir(&quot;η&quot;2-C60)(CO)Cl(Ph2CH2C6H4OCH2Ph)2] has been prepared where the metal center projects two electron-rich &#x27;arms&#x27; that embrace the C60 guest.

===Endohedral fullerenes===
Metal atoms or certain small molecules such as H2 and noble gas can be encapsulated inside the C60 cage. These endohedral fullerenes are usually synthesized by doping in the metal atoms in an arc reactor or by laser evaporation. These methods gives low yields of endohedral fullerenes, and a better method involves the opening of the cage, packing in the atoms or molecules, and closing the opening using certain organic reactions. This method, however, is still immature and only a few species have been synthesized this way.

Endohedral fullerenes show distinct and intriguing chemical properties that can be completely different from the encapsulated atom or molecule, as well as the fullerene itself. The encapsulated atoms have been shown to perform circular motions inside the C60 cage, and their motion has been followed using NMR spectroscopy.

==Potential applications in technology==
The optical absorption properties of C60 match the solar spectrum in a way that suggests that C60-based films could be useful for photovoltaic applications. Because of its high electronic affinity it is one of the most common electron acceptors used in donor/acceptor based solar cells. Conversion efficiencies up to 5.7% have been reported in C60–polymer cells.

==Potential applications in health==

=== Ingestion and risks ===
C60 is sensitive to light, so leaving C60 under light exposure causes it to degrade, becoming dangerous. The ingestion of C60 solutions that have been exposed to light could lead to developing cancer (tumors). So the management of C60 products for human ingestion requires cautionary measures such as: elaboration in very dark environments, encasing into bottles of great opacity, and storing in dark places, and others like consumption under low light conditions and using labels to warn about the problems with light.

Solutions of C60 dissolved in olive oil or water, as long as they are preserved from light, have been found nontoxic to rodents.

Otherwise, a study found that C60 remains in the body for a longer time than usual, especially in the liver, where it tends to be accumulated, and therefore has the potential to induce detrimental health effects.

=== Oils with C60 and risks ===
An experiment in 2011–2012 administered a solution of C60 in olive oil to rats, achieving a 90% prolongation of their lifespan. C60 in olive oil administered to mice resulted in no extension in lifespan. C60 in olive oil administered to beagle dogs resulted in a large reduction of C-reactive protein, which is commonly elevated in cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease. 

Many oils with C60 have been sold as antioxidant products, but it does not avoid the problem of their sensitivity to light, that can turn them toxic. A later research confirmed that exposure to light degrades solutions of C60 in oil, making it toxic and leading to a &quot;massive&quot; increase of the risk of developing cancer (tumors) after its consumption.

To avoid the degradation by effect of light, C60 oils must be made in very dark environments, encased into bottles of great opacity, and kept in darkness, consumed under low light conditions and accompanied by labels to warn about the dangers of light for C60.

Some producers have been able to dissolve C60 in water to avoid possible problems with oils, but that would not protect C60 from light, so the same cautions are needed.

<doc id="55227" wikidata="Q1052678" url="?curid=55227" title="Baire category theorem">
<text>The Baire category theorem (BCT) is an important result in general topology and functional analysis. The theorem has two forms, each of which gives sufficient conditions for a topological space to be a Baire space (a topological space such that the intersection of countably many dense open sets is still dense). It is used in the proof of results in many areas of analysis and geometry, including some of the fundamental theorems of functional analysis.

Versions of the Baire category theorem were first proved independently in 1897 by Osgood for the real line formula_1 and in 1899 by Baire for Euclidean space formula_2. The more general statement for completely metrizable spaces was first shown by Hausdorff in 1914.

==Statement==
A Baire space is a topological space formula_3 in which every countable intersection of open dense sets is dense in formula_4 See the corresponding article for a list of equivalent characterizations, as some are more useful than others depending on the application.

* (BCT1) Every complete pseudometric space is a Baire space. In particular, every completely metrizable topological space is a Baire space.
* (BCT2) Every locally compact regular space is a Baire space. In particular, every locally compact Hausdorff space is a Baire space.

Neither of these statements directly implies the other, since there are complete metric spaces that are not locally compact (the irrational numbers with the metric defined below; also, any Banach space of infinite dimension), and there are locally compact Hausdorff spaces that are not metrizable (for instance, any uncountable product of non-trivial compact Hausdorff spaces; also, several function spaces used in functional analysis; the uncountable Fort space).
See Steen and Seebach in the references below.

==Relation to the axiom of choice==
The proof of BCT1 for arbitrary complete metric spaces requires some form of the axiom of choice; and in fact BCT1 is equivalent over ZF to the axiom of dependent choice, a weak form of the axiom of choice.

A restricted form of the Baire category theorem, in which the complete metric space is also assumed to be separable, is provable in ZF with no additional choice principles.
This restricted form applies in particular to the real line, the Baire space formula_5 the Cantor space formula_6 and a separable Hilbert space such as the formula_7-space formula_8.

==Uses==
In functional analysis, BCT1 can be used to prove the open mapping theorem, the closed graph theorem and the uniform boundedness principle.

BCT1 also shows that every nonempty complete metric space with no isolated point is uncountable. (If formula_3 is a nonempty countable metric space with no isolated point, then each singleton formula_10 in formula_3 is nowhere dense, and formula_3 is meagre in itself.) In particular, this proves that the set of all real numbers is uncountable.

BCT1 shows that each of the following is a Baire space:
* The space formula_1 of real numbers
* The irrational numbers, with the metric defined by formula_14 where formula_15 is the first index for which the continued fraction expansions of formula_16 and formula_17 differ (this is a complete metric space)
* The Cantor set

By BCT2, every finite-dimensional Hausdorff manifold is a Baire space, since it is locally compact and Hausdorff. This is so even for non-paracompact (hence nonmetrizable) manifolds such as the long line.

BCT is used to prove Hartogs&#x27;s theorem, a fundamental result in the theory of several complex variables.

BCT1 is used to prove that a Banach space cannot have countably infinite dimension.

==Proof==

(BCT1) The following is a standard proof that a complete pseudometric space formula_3 is a Baire space.

Let formula_19 be a countable collection of open dense subsets. We want to show that the intersection formula_20 is dense.
A subset is dense if and only if every nonempty open subset intersects it. Thus to show that the intersection is dense, it suffices to show that any nonempty open subset formula_21 of formula_3 has some point formula_16 in common with all of the formula_24.
Because formula_25 is dense, formula_21 intersects formula_27 consequently, there exists a point formula_28 and a number formula_29 such that:
formula_30
where formula_31 and formula_32 denote an open and closed ball, respectively, centered at formula_16 with radius formula_34
Since each formula_24 is dense, this construction can be continued recursively to find a pair of sequences formula_36 and formula_37 such that:
formula_38

(This step relies on the axiom of choice and the fact that a finite intersection of open sets is open and hence an open ball can be found inside it centered at formula_36.)
The sequence formula_40 is Cauchy because formula_41 whenever formula_42 and hence formula_40 converges to some limit formula_16 by completeness.
If formula_15 is a positive integer then formula_46 (because this set is closed). 
Thus formula_47 and formula_48 for all formula_49 formula_50

There is an alternative proof using Choquet&#x27;s game.

(BCT2) The proof that a locally compact regular space formula_3 is a Baire space is similar. It uses the facts that (1) in such a space every point has a local base of closed compact neighborhoods; and (2) in a compact space any collection of closed sets with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection. The result for locally compact Hausdorff spaces is a special case, as such spaces are regular.

<text>Bushrangers were armed robbers and outlaws who resided in the Australian bush between the 1780s and the early 20th century. The original use of the term dates back to the early years of the British colonisation of Australia, and applied to transported convicts who had escaped into the bush to hide from the authorities. By the 1820s, the term had evolved to refer to those who took up &quot;robbery under arms&quot; as a way of life, using the bush as their base.

Bushranging thrived during the mid-19th century gold rushes, with many bushrangers roaming the goldfields and country districts of New South Wales and Victoria, and to a lesser extent Queensland. As the outbreak worsened in the mid-1860s, colonial governments outlawed many of the most notorious bushrangers, including the Gardiner–Hall gang, Dan Morgan, and the Clarke gang. These &quot;Wild Colonial Boys&quot;, mostly Australian-born sons of convicts, were roughly analogous to British highwaymen and outlaws of the American Old West, and their crimes included robbing small-town banks, bailing up coach services and raiding stations (pastoral estates). They also engaged in many shootouts with the police. 

The number of bushrangers declined in the 1870s due to better policing and improvements in rail transport and communication technology, such as telegraphy. The last major phase of bushranging peaked towards the end of the decade, epitomised by the Kelly gang, led by Ned Kelly, Australia&#x27;s best-known bushranger and outlaw. Although bushrangers appeared sporadically into the early 20th century, most historians regard Kelly&#x27;s capture and execution in 1880 as effectively representing the end of the bushranging era.

Bushranging&#x27;s origins in a convict system bred a unique kind of desperado, most frequently with an Irish political background. Native-born bushrangers also expressed nascent Australian nationalist views and have been described as &quot;the first distinctively Australian characters to gain general recognition.&quot; As such, a number of bushrangers became folk heroes and symbols of rebellion, admired for their bravery, rough chivalry and colourful personalities. However, in stark contrast to romantic portrayals in the arts and popular culture, bushrangers often led lives that were &quot;nasty, brutish and short&quot;, with some earning notoriety for their cruelty and bloodthirst. Australian attitudes toward bushrangers remain complex and ambivalent.

==Etymology==

The earliest documented use of the term appears in a February 1805 issue of &quot;The Sydney Gazette&quot;, which reports that a cart had been stopped between Sydney and Hawkesbury by three men &quot;whose appearance sanctioned the suspicion of their being bush-rangers&quot;. John Bigge described bushranging in 1821 as &quot;absconding in the woods and living upon plunder and the robbery of orchards.&quot; Charles Darwin likewise recorded in 1835 that a bushranger was &quot;an open villain who subsists by highway robbery, and will sooner be killed than taken alive&quot;.

==History==
Over 2,000 bushrangers are estimated to have roamed the Australian countryside, beginning with the convict bolters and drawing to a close after Ned Kelly&#x27;s last stand at Glenrowan.

===Convict era (1780s–1840s)===
Bushranging began soon after British settlement with the establishment of New South Wales as a penal colony in 1788. The majority of early bushrangers were convicts who had escaped prison, or from the properties of landowners to whom they had been assigned as servants. These bushrangers, also known as &quot;bolters&quot;, preferred the hazards of wild, unexplored bushland surrounding Sydney to the deprivation and brutality of convict life. The first notable bushranger, African convict John Caesar, robbed settlers for food, and had a brief, tempestuous alliance with Aboriginal resistance fighters during Pemulwuy&#x27;s War. While other bushrangers would go on to fight alongside Indigenous Australians in frontier conflicts with the colonial authorities, the Government tried to bring an end to any such collaboration by rewarding Aborigines for returning convicts to custody. Aboriginal trackers would play a significant role in the hunt for bushrangers.

Colonel Godfrey Mundy described convict bushrangers as &quot;desperate, hopeless, fearless; rendered so, perhaps, by the tyranny of a gaoler, of an overseer, or of a master to whom he has been assigned.&quot; Edward Smith Hall, editor of early Sydney newspaper &quot;The Monitor&quot;, agreed that the convict system was a breeding-ground for bushrangers due to its savagery, with starvation and acts of torture being rampant. &quot;Liberty or Death!&quot; was the cry of convict bushrangers, and in large numbers they roamed beyond Sydney, some hoping to reach China, which was commonly believed to be connected by an overland route. Some bolters seized boats and set sail for foreign lands, but most were hunted down and brought back to Australia. Others attempted to inspire an overhaul of the convict system, or simply sought revenge on their captors. This latter desire found expression in the convict ballad &quot;Jim Jones at Botany Bay&quot;, in which Jones, the narrator, plans to join bushranger Jack Donahue and &quot;gun the floggers down&quot;.

Donahue was the most notorious of the early New South Wales bushrangers, terrorising settlements outside Sydney from 1827 until he was fatally shot by a trooper in 1830. That same year, west of the Blue Mountains, convict Ralph Entwistle sparked a bushranging insurgency known as the Bathurst Rebellion. He and his gang raided farms, liberating assigned convicts by force in the process, and within a month, his personal army numbered 80 men. Following gun battles with vigilante posses, mounted policemen and soldiers of the 39th and 57th Regiment of Foot, he and nine of his men were captured and executed.
Convict bushrangers were particularly prevalent in the penal colony of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now the state of Tasmania), established in 1803. The island&#x27;s most powerful bushranger, the self-styled &quot;Lieutenant Governor of the Woods&quot;, Michael Howe, led a gang of up to one hundred members &quot;in what amounted to a civil war&quot; with the colonial government. His control over large swathes of the island prompted elite squatters from Hobart and Launceston to collude with him, and for six months in 1815, Lieutenant-Governor Thomas Davey, fearing a convict uprising, declared martial law in an effort to suppress Howe&#x27;s influence. Most of the gang had either been captured or killed by 1818, the year Howe was clubbed to death by a soldier. Vandemonian bushranging peaked in the 1820s with hundreds of bolters at large, among the most notorious being Matthew Brady&#x27;s gang, cannibal serial killers Alexander Pearce and Thomas Jeffrey, and tracker-turned-resistance leader Musquito. Jackey Jackey (alias of William Westwood) was sent from New South Wales to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in 1842 after attempting to escape Cockatoo Island. In 1843, he escaped Port Arthur, and took up bushranging in Tasmania&#x27;s mountains, but was recaptured and sent to Norfolk Island, where, as leader of the 1846 Cooking Pot Uprising, he murdered three constables, and was hanged along with sixteen of his men.

The era of convict bushrangers gradually faded with the decline in penal transportations to Australia in the 1840s. It had ceased by the 1850s to all colonies except Western Australia, which accepted convicts between 1850 and 1868. The best-known convict bushranger of the colony was the prolific escapee Moondyne Joe.

===Gold rush era (1850s–1860s)===
The Australian gold rushes of the 1850s and 1860s marked the next distinct phase of bushranging, as the discovery of gold gave bushrangers access to great wealth that was portable and easily converted to cash. Their task was assisted by the isolated location of the goldfields and the decimation of the police force with many troopers abandoning their duties to join the gold rush.

In Victoria, several major gold robberies occurred in 1852–53. Three bushrangers, including George Melville, were hanged in front of a large crowd for their role in the 1853 McIvor Escort Robbery near Castlemaine. Bushranging numbers also flourished in New South Wales with the rise of the colonial-born sons of poor ex-convicts who were drawn to a more glamorous life than mining or farming. Much of the activity in the colony was in the Lachlan Valley, around Forbes, Yass and Cowra.
The Gardiner–Hall gang, led by Frank Gardiner and Ben Hall and counting John Dunn, John Gilbert and Fred Lowry among its members, was responsible for some of the most daring robberies of the 1860s, including the 1862 Escort Rock robbery, Australia&#x27;s largest ever gold heist. The gang also engaged in many shootouts with the police, resulting in deaths on both sides. Other bushrangers active in New South Wales during this period, such as Dan Morgan, and the Clarke brothers and their associates, murdered multiple policemen.

As bushranging continued to escalate in the 1860s, the Parliament of New South Wales passed a bill, the &quot;Felons Apprehension Act 1865&quot;, that effectively allowed anyone to shoot outlawed bushrangers on sight. By the time that the Clarke brothers were captured and hanged in 1867, organised gang bushranging in New South Wales had effectively ceased.

Captain Thunderbolt (alias of Frederick Ward) robbed inns and mail-coaches across northern New South Wales for six and a half years, one of the longest careers of any bushranger. He sometimes operated alone; at other times, he led gangs, and was accompanied by his Aboriginal &#x27;wife&#x27;, Mary Ann Bugg, who is credited with helping extend his career.

===Decline and the Kelly gang (1870s–1880s)===

The increasing push of settlement, increased police efficiency, improvements in rail transport and communications technology, such as telegraphy, made it more difficult for bushrangers to evade capture. In 1870, Captain Thunderbolt was fatally shot by a policeman, and with his death, the New South Wales bushranging epidemic that began in the early 1860s came to an end.
The scholarly, but eccentric Captain Moonlite (alias of Andrew George Scott) worked as an Anglican lay reader before turning to bushranging. Imprisoned in Ballarat for an armed bank robbery on the Victorian goldfields, he escaped, but was soon recaptured and received a ten-year sentence in HM Prison Pentridge. Within a year of his release in 1879, he and his gang held up the town of Wantabadgery in the Riverina. Two of the gang (including Moonlite&#x27;s &quot;soulmate&quot; and alleged lover, James Nesbitt) and one trooper were killed when the police attacked. Scott was found guilty of murder and hanged along with one of his accomplices on 20 January 1880.

Among the last bushrangers was the Kelly gang in Victoria, led by Ned Kelly, Australia&#x27;s most famous bushranger. After murdering three policemen in a shootout in 1878, the gang was outlawed, and after raiding towns and robbing banks into 1879, earned the distinction of having the largest reward ever placed on the heads of bushrangers. In 1880, after failing to derail and ambush a police train, the gang, clad in bulletproof armour they had devised, engaged in a shootout with the police. Ned Kelly, the only gang member to survive, was hanged at the Melbourne Gaol on 11 November 1880.

===Isolated outbreaks (1890s–1900s)===

Bushranging was largely considered a bygone era by the 1890s. There were however a few major cases from this point on, including the Governor gang—a trio consisting of Aboriginal fencing contractor Jimmy Governor, his brother Joe Governor, and associate Jack Underwood. In July 1900 they perpetrated the Breelong Massacre, killing four members of the Mawbey family and a schoolteacher. The Governor brothers proceeded to engage in a crime spree across northern New South Wales, murdering an additional four people and triggering one of the largest manhunts in Australian history. After three months, Jimmy was arrested by a group of armed locals in Bobin, and his brother Joe was fatally shot near Singleton a few days later. Jack Underwood (who had been caught shortly after the Breelong Massacre) was hanged in Dubbo Gaol on 14 January 1901, and Jimmy Governor was hanged in Darlinghurst Gaol on 18 January 1901.

The Kenniff brothers, Patrick and James, were notorious stock thieves who operated in western Queensland. In March 1902, they murdered constables George Doyle and Albert Dahlke, who were sent to apprehend them. Three months later, the brothers were captured on 23 June at now-named Arrest Creek. Both brothers were convicted of murder, with Patrick sentenced to hang, and James initially sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.

===&quot;Boy bushrangers&quot; (1910s–1920s)===
The final phase of bushranging was sustained by the so-called &quot;boy bushrangers&quot;—youths who sought to commit crimes, mostly armed robberies, modelled on the exploits of their bushranging &quot;heroes&quot;. The majority were captured alive; a few died in shootouts with the police.

==Public perception==

In Australia, bushrangers often attract public sympathy (cf. the concept of social bandits). In Australian history and iconography bushrangers are held in some esteem in some quarters due to the harshness and anti-Catholicism of the colonial authorities whom they embarrassed, and the romanticism of the lawlessness they represented. Some bushrangers, most notably Ned Kelly in his Jerilderie letter, and in his final raid on Glenrowan, explicitly represented themselves as political rebels. Attitudes to Kelly, by far the most well-known bushranger, exemplify the ambivalent views of Australians regarding bushranging.

==Legacy==
The impact of bushrangers upon the areas in which they roamed is evidenced in the names of many geographical features in Australia, including Brady&#x27;s Lookout, Moondyne Cave, the township of Codrington, Mount Tennent, Thunderbolts Way and Ward&#x27;s Mistake. The districts of North East Victoria are unofficially known as Kelly Country.

Some bushrangers made a mark on Australian literature. While running from soldiers in 1818, Michael Howe dropped a knapsack containing a self-made book of kangaroo skin and written in kangaroo blood. In it was a dream diary and plans for a settlement he intended to found in the bush. Sometime bushranger Francis MacNamara, also known as Frank the Poet, wrote some of the best-known poems of the convict era. Several convict bushrangers also wrote autobiographies, including Jackey Jackey, Martin Cash and Owen Suffolk.

===Cultural depictions===

Jack Donahue was the first bushranger to have inspired bush ballads, including &quot;Bold Jack Donahue&quot; and &quot;The Wild Colonial Boy&quot;. Ben Hall and his gang were the subject of several bush ballads, including &quot;Streets of Forbes&quot;.

Michael Howe inspired the earliest play set in Tasmania, &quot;Michael Howe, The Terror of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot;, which premiered at The Old Vic in London in 1821. Other early plays about bushrangers include David Burn&#x27;s &quot;The Bushrangers&quot; (1829), William Leman Rede&#x27;s &quot;Faith and Falsehood; or, The Fate of the Bushranger&quot; (1830), William Thomas Moncrieff&#x27;s &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land: An Operatic Drama&quot; (1831), &quot;The Bushrangers; or, Norwood Vale&quot; (1834) by Henry Melville, and &quot;The Bushrangers; or, The Tregedy of Donohoe&quot; (1835) by Charles Harpur.

In the late 19th century, E. W. Hornung and Hume Nisbet created popular bushranger novels within the conventions of the European &quot;noble bandit&quot; tradition. First serialised in &quot;The Sydney Mail&quot; in 1882–83, Rolf Boldrewood&#x27;s bushranging novel &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot; is considered a classic of Australian colonial literature. It also cited as an important influence on the American writer Owen Wister&#x27;s 1902 novel &quot;The Virginian&quot;, widely regarded as the first Western.

Bushrangers were a favoured subject of colonial artists such as S. T. Gill, Frank P. Mahony and William Strutt. Tom Roberts, one of the leading figures of the Heidelberg School (also known as Australian Impressionism), depicted bushrangers in some of his history paintings, including &quot;In a corner on the Macintyre&quot; (1894) and &quot;Bailed Up&quot; (1895), both set in Inverell, the area where Captain Thunderbolt was once active.

====Film====

Although not the first Australian film with a bushranging theme, &quot;The Story of the Kelly Gang&quot; (1906)—the world&#x27;s first feature-length narrative film—is regarded as having set the template for the genre. On the back of the film&#x27;s success, its producers released one of two 1907 film adaptations of Boldrewood&#x27;s &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot; (the other being Charles MacMahon&#x27;s version). Entering the first &quot;golden age&quot; of Australian cinema (1910–12), director John Gavin released two fictionalised accounts of real-life bushrangers: &quot;Moonlite&quot; (1910) and &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; (1910). The genre&#x27;s popularity with audiences led to a spike of production unprecedented in world cinema. &quot;Dan Morgan&quot; (1911) is notable for portraying its title character as an insane villain rather than a figure of romance. Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner, Captain Starlight, and numerous other bushrangers also received cinematic treatments at this time.

Alarmed by what they saw as the glorification of outlawry, state governments imposed a ban on bushranger films in 1912, effectively removing &quot;the entire folklore relating to bushrangers ... from the most popular form of cultural expression.&quot; It is seen as a major reason for the collapse of a booming Australian film industry. One of the few Australian films to escape the ban before it was lifted in the 1940s is the 1920 adaptation of &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot;. Also during this lull appeared American takes on the bushranger genre, including &quot;The Bushranger&quot; (1928), &quot;Stingaree&quot; (1934) and &quot;Captain Fury&quot; (1939).

&quot;Ned Kelly&quot; (1970) starred Mick Jagger in the title role. Dennis Hopper portrayed Dan Morgan in &quot;Mad Dog Morgan&quot; (1976). More recent bushranger films include &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; (2003), starring Heath Ledger, &quot;The Proposition&quot; (2005), written by Nick Cave, &quot;The Outlaw Michael Howe&quot; (2013), and &quot;The Legend of Ben Hall&quot; (2016).

<text>Larrea tridentata, called creosote bush, greasewood, and chaparral is a medicinal herb. In Sonora, it is more commonly called &quot;hediondilla&quot;; Spanish &quot;hediondo&quot; = &quot;smelly&quot;. It is a flowering plant in the family Zygophyllaceae. The specific name &quot;tridentata&quot; refers to its three-toothed leaves.

==Distribution==

&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot; is a prominent species in the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Deserts of western North America, and its range includes those and other regions in portions of southeastern California, Arizona, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, New Mexico, and Texas in the United States, and Chihuahua, Sonora, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Zacatecas, Durango and San Luis Potosì in Mexico. The species grows as far east as Zapata County, Texas, along the Rio Grande southeast of Laredo near the 99th meridian west.

==Description==

&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot; is an evergreen shrub growing to tall, rarely . The light gray stems of the plant bear resinous, dark green leaves with two opposite lanceolate leaflets joined at the base, with a deciduous awn between them, each leaflet long and broad. The flowers are up to in diameter, with five yellow petals. The fruit is a brown-burgundy spherical, fuzzy capsule, which separates into five individual carpels each containing one seed. Galls may form by the activity of the creosote gall midge. The whole plant exhibits a characteristic odor of creosote, from which the common name derives. In the regions where it grows, its smell is often associated with the &quot;smell of rain&quot;, as the scent of its&#x27; resinous leaves intensifies in rain.

==Ecology==
These animals eat creosote bush:
*Leaves: Of mammals, only the jackrabbit, and only when it can find no other food, as the leaves are bitter; desert iguanas, and the chuckwalla.
*Seeds: desert woodrats and kangaroo rats
*Flowers: 22 species of bees, as pollinators, the chuckwalla, desert iguanas, etc
*Many species of insect

The Arabian camel, brought to the area by the United States Camel Corps, readily ate creosote bush. It is thought that this meeting reestablished a biological relationship that was broken when the American camels became extinct in the Quaternary Extinction Event, making it an evolutionary anachronism.

==Oldest plants==
As the creosote bush grows older, its oldest branches eventually die and its crown splits into separate crowns. This normally happens when the plant is 30 to 90 years old. Eventually, the old crown dies and the new ones become a clonal colony from the previous plant, composed of many separate stems all from the same seed. The cloned individuals sometimes form a &quot;ring&quot; around the original plant, which may no longer be visible.

===King Clone===

The &quot;King Clone&quot; creosote ring is one of the oldest living organisms on Earth. It has been alive an estimated 11,700 years, in the central Mojave Desert near present-day Lucerne Valley, California. This single clonal colony plant of &quot;L. tridentata&quot; reaches up to in diameter, with an average diameter of .

King Clone was identified and its age estimated by Frank Vasek, a professor at the University of California, Riverside. Measurements of the plant, as well as radiocarbon dating of wood fragments, were used to determine the plant&#x27;s mean annual growth rate outward from the center of the ring. By measuring the diameter of the ring, its total age could be estimated. It is within the Creosote Rings Preserve of the Lucerne Valley and Johnson Valley.

==Habitat==

Creosote bush is most common on the well-drained soils of alluvial fans and flats. In parts of its range, it may cover large areas in practically pure stands, though it usually occurs in association with &quot;Ambrosia dumosa&quot; (burro bush or bur-sage). Chemicals found in creosote bush roots have been shown to inhibit the growth of burro bush roots, but as of 2013, much of their relationship remains unexplained.

Creosote bush stands tend to display an evenly spaced distribution of plants. Originally, it was assumed that the plant produced a water-soluble inhibitor that prevented the growth of other bushes near mature, healthy bushes. Now, however, it has been shown that the root systems of mature creosote plants are simply so efficient at absorbing water that fallen seeds nearby cannot accumulate enough water to germinate, effectively creating dead zones around every plant.

==Desert adaptation==
Owing to the harshness of the germination environment above mature root systems, young creosote bushes are much more susceptible to drought stress than established plants. Germination is quite active during wet periods, but most of the young plants die very quickly unless water conditions are optimal. Ground heat compounds the young plants&#x27; susceptibility to water stress, and ground temperatures can reach upwards of 70 °C (160 °F). To become established, the young plant apparently must experience three to five years of abnormally cool and moist weather during and after germination. From this, it can be inferred that all the plants inside a stand are of equal age.

Mature plants, however, can tolerate extreme drought stress. In terms of negative water potential, creosote bushes can operate fully at −50 bars of water potential and have been found living down to −120 bars, although the practical average floor is around −70 bars, where the plant&#x27;s need for cellular respiration generally exceeds the level that the water-requiring process of photosynthesis can provide. Cell division can occur during these times of water stress, and new cells commonly quickly absorb water after rainfall. This rapid uptake causes branches to grow several centimeters at the end of a wet season.

Water loss is reduced by the resinous waxy coating of the leaves, and by their small size, which prevents them from heating above air temperature (which would increase the vapor pressure deficit between the leaf and the air, thus increasing water loss). Plants drop some leaves heading into summer, but if all leaves are lost, the plant will not recover. Accumulation of fallen leaves, as well as other detritus caught from the passing wind, creates an ecological community specific to the creosote bush canopy, including beetles, millipedes, pocket mice, and kangaroo rats.

==Uses==
===Native American medicinals===
Native Americans in the Southwest held beliefs that it treated many maladies, including sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, chicken pox, dysmenorrhea, and snakebite. The Coahuilla Indians used the plant for intestinal complaints and tuberculosis. The Pima drank a decoction of the leaves as an emetic, and applied the boiled leaves as poultices to wounds or sores. Tohono O&#x27;odham Indians prepared it medicinally for stiff limbs, snake bites, and menstrual cramps. The shrub is still widely used as an herbal medicine in Mexico.

In other uses, the reddish-colored lac that exudes from the plant was used by the Tohono O&#x27;odham, after boiling, to make a mending glue on broken pottery.

===Herbal supplements and toxicity===
&quot;Larrea tridentata&quot; is often referred to as &quot;chaparral&quot; when used as a herbal remedy and supplement; however, it does not grow in the synonymous plant community chaparral. The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the health hazards of ingesting &quot;chaparral&quot; or using it as an internal medicine, and discourages its use. In 2005, Health Canada issued a warning to consumers to avoid using the leaves of &quot;Larrea&quot; species because of the risk of damage to the liver and kidneys.

Cancer Research UK states: &quot;We don&#x27;t recommend that you take chaparral to treat or prevent any type of cancer.&quot;

<doc id="55236" wikidata="Q25424022" url="?curid=55236" title="Compton scattering">
<text>Compton scattering (or the Compton effect) is the quantum theory of high frequency photons scattering following an interaction with a charged particle, usually an electron. Specifically, when the photon hits electrons, it releases loosely bound electrons from the outer valence shells of atoms or molecules.

The effect was discovered in 1923 by Arthur Holly Compton while researching the scattering of X-rays by light elements, and earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927. The Compton effect significantly deviated from dominating classical theories, using both special relativity and quantum mechanics to explain the interaction between high frequency photons and charged particles.

Photons can interact with matter at the atomic level (e.g. photoelectric effect and Rayleigh scattering), at the nucleus, or with just an electron. Pair production and the Compton effect occur at the level of the electron. When a high frequency photon scatters due to an interaction with a charged particle, there is a decrease in the energy of the photon and thus, an increase in its wavelength. This tradeoff between wavelength and energy in response to the collision is the Compton effect. Because of conservation of energy, the lost energy from the photon is transferred to the recoiling particle (such an electron would be called a &quot;Compton Recoil electron&quot;).

This implies that if the recoiling particle initially carried more energy than the photon, the reverse would occur. This is known as inverse Compton scattering, in which the scattered photon increases in energy.

== Introduction ==

In Compton&#x27;s original experiment (see Fig. 1), the energy of the X ray photon (≈ 17 keV) was significantly larger than the binding energy of the atomic electron, so the electrons could be treated as being free after scattering. The amount by which the light&#x27;s wavelength changes is called the Compton shift. Although nucleus Compton scattering exists, Compton scattering usually refers to the interaction involving only the electrons of an atom. The Compton effect was observed by Arthur Holly Compton in 1923 at Washington University in St. Louis and further verified by his graduate student Y. H. Woo in the years following. Compton was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery.

The effect is significant because it demonstrates that light cannot be explained purely as a wave phenomenon. Thomson scattering, the classical theory of an electromagnetic wave scattered by charged particles, cannot explain shifts in wavelength at low intensity: classically, light of sufficient intensity for the electric field to accelerate a charged particle to a relativistic speed will cause radiation-pressure recoil and an associated Doppler shift of the scattered light, but the effect would become arbitrarily small at sufficiently low light intensities &quot;regardless of wavelength&quot;. Thus, if we are to explain low-intensity Compton scattering, light must behave as if it consists of particles. Or the assumption that the electron can be treated as free is invalid resulting in the effectively infinite electron mass equal to the nuclear mass (see e.g. the comment below on elastic scattering of X-rays being from that effect). Compton&#x27;s experiment convinced physicists that light can be treated as a stream of particle-like objects (quanta called photons), whose energy is proportional to the light wave&#x27;s frequency.

As shown in Fig. 2, the interaction between an electron and a photon results in the electron being given part of the energy (making it recoil), and a photon of the remaining energy being emitted in a different direction from the original, so that the overall momentum of the system is also conserved. If the scattered photon still has enough energy, the process may be repeated. In this scenario, the electron is treated as free or loosely bound. Experimental verification of momentum conservation in individual Compton scattering processes by Bothe and Geiger as well as by Compton and Simon has been important in disproving the BKS theory.

Compton scattering is commonly described as inelastic scattering. This is because, unlike the more common Thomson scattering that happens at the low-energy limit, the energy in the scattered photon in Compton scattering is less than the energy of the incident photon. As the electron is typically weakly bound to the atom, the scattering can be viewed from either the perspective of an electron in a potential well, or as an atom with a small ionization energy. In the former perspective, energy of the incident photon is transferred to the recoil particle, but only as kinetic energy. The electron gains no internal energy, respective masses remain the same, the mark of an elastic collision. From this perspective, Compton scattering could be considered elastic because the internal state of the electron does not change during the scattering process. In the latter perspective, the atom&#x27;s state is change, constituting an inelastic collision. Whether Compton scattering is considered elastic or inelastic depends on which perspective is being used, as well as the context.

Compton scattering is one of four competing processes when photons interact with matter. At energies of a few eV to a few keV, corresponding to visible light through soft X-rays, a photon can be completely absorbed and its energy can eject an electron from its host atom, a process known as the photoelectric effect. High-energy photons of and above may bombard the nucleus and cause an electron and a positron to be formed, a process called pair production; even-higher-energy photons (beyond a threshold energy of at least , depending on the nuclei involved), can eject a nucleon or alpha particle from the nucleus in a process called photodisintegration. Compton scattering is the most important interaction in the intervening energy region, at photon energies greater than those typical of the photoelectric effect but less than the pair-production threshold.

== Description of the phenomenon ==

By the early 20th century, research into the interaction of X-rays with matter was well under way. It was observed that when X-rays of a known wavelength interact with atoms, the X-rays are scattered through an angle formula_1 and emerge at a different wavelength related to formula_1. Although classical electromagnetism predicted that the wavelength of scattered rays should be equal to the initial wavelength, multiple experiments had found that the wavelength of the scattered rays was longer (corresponding to lower energy) than the initial wavelength.

In 1923, Compton published a paper in the &quot;Physical Review&quot; that explained the X-ray shift by attributing particle-like momentum to light quanta (Albert Einstein had proposed light quanta in 1905 in explaining the photo-electric effect, but Compton did not build on Einstein&#x27;s work). The energy of light quanta depends only on the frequency of the light. In his paper, Compton derived the mathematical relationship between the shift in wavelength and the scattering angle of the X-rays by assuming that each scattered X-ray photon interacted with only one electron. His paper concludes by reporting on experiments which verified his derived relation:
formula_3
where
* formula_4 is the initial wavelength,
* formula_5 is the wavelength after scattering,
* formula_6 is the Planck constant,
* formula_7 is the electron rest mass,
* formula_8 is the speed of light, and
* formula_1 is the scattering angle.

The quantity is known as the Compton wavelength of the electron; it is equal to . The wavelength shift is at least zero (for ) and at most twice the Compton wavelength of the electron (for ).

Compton found that some X-rays experienced no wavelength shift despite being scattered through large angles; in each of these cases the photon failed to eject an electron. Thus the magnitude of the shift is related not to the Compton wavelength of the electron, but to the Compton wavelength of the entire atom, which can be upwards of 10000 times smaller. This is known as &quot;coherent&quot; scattering off the entire atom since the atom remains intact, gaining no internal excitation.

In Compton&#x27;s original experiments the wavelength shift given above was the directly measurable observable. In modern experiments it is conventional to measure the energies, not the wavelengths, of the scattered photons. For a given incident energy formula_10, the outgoing final-state photon energy, formula_11, is given by
formula_12

=== Derivation of the scattering formula ===

A photon with wavelength collides with an electron in an atom, which is treated as being at rest. The collision causes the electron to recoil, and a new photon ′ with wavelength ′ emerges at angle from the photon&#x27;s incoming path. Let ′ denote the electron after the collision. Compton allowed for the possibility that the interaction would sometimes accelerate the electron to speeds sufficiently close to the velocity of light as to require the application of Einstein&#x27;s special relativity theory to properly describe its energy and momentum.

At the conclusion of Compton&#x27;s 1923 paper, he reported results of experiments confirming the predictions of his scattering formula, thus supporting the assumption that photons carry momentum as well as quantized energy. At the start of his derivation, he had postulated an expression for the momentum of a photon from equating Einstein&#x27;s already established mass-energy relationship of formula_13 to the quantized photon energies of formula_14, which Einstein had separately postulated. If formula_15, the equivalent photon mass must be formula_16. The photon&#x27;s momentum is then simply this effective mass times the photon&#x27;s frame-invariant velocity . For a photon, its momentum formula_17, and thus can be substituted for for all photon momentum terms which arise in course of the derivation below. The derivation which appears in Compton&#x27;s paper is more terse, but follows the same logic in the same sequence as the following derivation.

The conservation of energy formula_18 merely equates the sum of energies before and after scattering.
: formula_19
Compton postulated that photons carry momentum; thus from the conservation of momentum, the momenta of the particles should be similarly related by
: formula_20
in which (formula_21) is omitted on the assumption it is effectively zero.

The photon energies are related to the frequencies by
: formula_22
: formula_23
where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant.

Before the scattering event, the electron is treated as sufficiently close to being at rest that its total energy consists entirely of the mass-energy equivalence of its (rest) mass formula_24,
: formula_25
After scattering, the possibility that the electron might be accelerated to a significant fraction of the speed of light, requires that its total energy be represented using the relativistic energy–momentum relation
: formula_26

Substituting these quantities into the expression for the conservation of energy gives
: formula_27
This expression can be used to find the magnitude of the momentum of the scattered electron,

Note that this magnitude of the momentum gained by the electron (formerly zero) exceeds the energy/&quot;c&quot; lost by the photon,
: formula_28

Equation (1) relates the various energies associated with the collision. The electron&#x27;s momentum change involves a relativistic change in the energy of the electron, so it is not simply related to the change in energy occurring in classical physics. The change of the magnitude of the momentum of the photon is not just related to the change of its energy; it also involves a change in direction.

Solving the conservation of momentum expression for the scattered electron&#x27;s momentum gives
: formula_29

Making use of the scalar product yields the square of its magnitude,
: formula_30
In anticipation of formula_31 being replaced with formula_14, multiply both sides by formula_33,
: formula_34

After replacing the photon momentum terms with formula_35, we get a second expression for the magnitude of the momentum of the scattered electron,
Equating the alternate expressions for this momentum gives
: formula_36
which, after evaluating the square and canceling and rearranging terms, further yields
: formula_37
Dividing both sides by yields
: formula_38

Finally, since = = ,
It can further be seen that the angle of the outgoing electron with the direction of the incoming photon is specified by 
== Applications ==

=== Compton scattering ===
Compton scattering is of prime importance to radiobiology, as it is the most probable interaction of gamma rays and high energy X-rays with atoms in living beings and is applied in radiation therapy.
Compton scattering is an important effect in gamma spectroscopy which gives rise to the Compton edge, as it is possible for the gamma rays to scatter out of the detectors used. Compton suppression is used to detect stray scatter gamma rays to counteract this effect.

=== Magnetic Compton scattering ===
Magnetic Compton scattering is an extension of the previously mentioned technique which involves the magnetisation of a crystal sample hit with high energy, circularly polarised photons. By measuring the scattered photons&#x27; energy and reversing the magnetisation of the sample, two different Compton profiles are generated (one for spin up momenta and one for spin down momenta). Taking the difference between these two profiles gives the magnetic Compton profile (MCP), given by formula_39 – a one-dimensional projection of the electron spin density.
formula_40
where formula_41 is the number of spin-unpaired electrons in the system, formula_42 and formula_43 are the three-dimensional electron momentum distributions for the majority spin and minority spin electrons respectively.

Since this scattering process is incoherent (there is no phase relationship between the scattered photons), the MCP is representative of the bulk properties of the sample and is a probe of the ground state. This means that the MCP is ideal for comparison with theoretical techniques such as density functional theory.
The area under the MCP is directly proportional to the spin moment of the system and so, when combined with total moment measurements methods (such as SQUID magnetometry), can be used to isolate both the spin and orbital contributions to the total moment of a system.
The shape of the MCP also yields insight into the origin of the magnetism in the system.

=== Inverse Compton scattering ===
Inverse Compton scattering is important in astrophysics. In X-ray astronomy, the accretion disk surrounding a black hole is presumed to produce a thermal spectrum. The lower energy photons produced from this spectrum are scattered to higher energies by relativistic electrons in the surrounding corona. This is surmised to cause the power law component in the X-ray spectra (0.2–10 keV) of accreting black holes.

The effect is also observed when photons from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) move through the hot gas surrounding a galaxy cluster. The CMB photons are scattered to higher energies by the electrons in this gas, resulting in the Sunyaev–Zel&#x27;dovich effect. Observations of the Sunyaev–Zel&#x27;dovich effect provide a nearly redshift-independent means of detecting galaxy clusters.

Some synchrotron radiation facilities scatter laser light off the stored electron beam.
This Compton backscattering produces high energy photons in the MeV to GeV range subsequently used for nuclear physics experiments.

=== Non-linear inverse Compton scattering ===
Non-linear inverse Compton scattering (NICS) is the scattering of multiple low-energy photons, given by an intense electromagnetic field, in a high-energy photon (X-ray or gamma ray) during the interaction with a charged particle, such as an electron. It is also called non-linear Compton scattering and multiphoton Compton scattering. It is the non-linear version of inverse Compton scattering in which the conditions for multiphoton absorption by the charged particle are reached due to a very intense electromagnetic field, for example the one produced by a laser.

Non-linear inverse Compton scattering is an interesting phenomenon for all applications requiring high-energy photons since NICS is capable of producing photons with energy comparable to the charged particle rest energy and higher. As a consequence NICS photons can be used to trigger other phenomena such as pair production, Compton scattering, nuclear reactions, and can be used to probe non-linear quantum effects and non-linear QED.

<doc id="55244" wikidata="Q830787" url="?curid=55244" title="Hypersonic speed">
<text>In aerodynamics, a hypersonic speed is one that exceeds five times the speed of sound, often stated as starting at speeds of Mach 5 and above.

The precise Mach number at which a craft can be said to be flying at hypersonic speed varies, since individual physical changes in the airflow (like molecular dissociation and ionization) occur at different speeds; these effects collectively become important around Mach 5–10. The hypersonic regime can also be alternatively defined as speeds where specific heat capacity changes with the temperature of the flow as kinetic energy of the moving object is converted into heat.

==Characteristics of flow==

While the definition of hypersonic flow can be quite vague and is generally debatable (especially because of the absence of discontinuity between supersonic and hypersonic flows), a hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain physical phenomena that can no longer be analytically discounted as in supersonic flow. The peculiarities in hypersonic flows are as follows:
# Shock layer
# Aerodynamic heating
# Entropy layer
# Real gas effects
# Low density effects
# Independence of aerodynamic coefficients with Mach number.

===Small shock stand-off distance===
As a body&#x27;s Mach number increases, the density behind a bow shock generated by the body also increases, which corresponds to a decrease in volume behind the shock due to conservation of mass. Consequently, the distance between the bow shock and the body decreases at higher Mach numbers.

===Entropy layer===
As Mach numbers increase, the entropy change across the shock also increases, which results in a strong entropy gradient and highly vortical flow that mixes with the boundary layer.

===Viscous interaction===
A portion of the large kinetic energy associated with flow at high Mach numbers transforms into internal energy in the fluid due to viscous effects. The increase in internal energy is realized as an increase in temperature. Since the pressure gradient normal to the flow within a boundary layer is approximately zero for low to moderate hypersonic Mach numbers, the increase of temperature through the boundary layer coincides with a decrease in density. This causes the bottom of the boundary layer to expand, so that the boundary layer over the body grows thicker and can often merge with the shock wave near the body leading edge.

===High-temperature flow===
High temperatures due to a manifestation of viscous dissipation cause non-equilibrium chemical flow properties such as vibrational excitation and dissociation and ionization of molecules resulting in convective and radiative heat-flux.

== Classification of Mach regimes ==
Although &quot;subsonic&quot; and &quot;supersonic&quot; usually refer to speeds below and above the local speed of sound respectively, aerodynamicists often use these terms to refer to particular ranges of Mach values. When an aircraft approaches transonic speeds (around Mach 1), it enters a special regime. The usual approximations based on the Navier–Stokes equations, which work well for subsonic designs, start to break down because, even in the freestream, some parts of the flow locally exceed Mach 1. So, more sophisticated methods are needed to handle this complex behavior.

The &quot;supersonic regime&quot; usually refers to the set of Mach numbers for which linearised theory may be used; for example, where the (air) flow is not chemically reacting and where heat transfer between air and vehicle may be reasonably neglected in calculations. Generally, NASA defines &quot;high&quot; hypersonic as any Mach number from 10 to 25, and re-entry speeds as anything greater than Mach 25. Among the spacecraft operating in these regimes are returning Soyuz and Dragon space capsules; the previously-operated Space Shuttle; various reusable spacecraft in development such as SpaceX Starship and Rocket Lab Electron; and (theoretical) spaceplanes.

In the following table, the &quot;regimes&quot; or &quot;ranges of Mach values&quot; are referenced instead of the usual meanings of &quot;subsonic&quot; and &quot;supersonic&quot;.

==Similarity parameters==
The categorization of airflow relies on a number of similarity parameters, which allow the simplification of a nearly infinite number of test cases into groups of similarity. For transonic and compressible flow, the Mach and Reynolds numbers alone allow good categorization of many flow cases.

Hypersonic flows, however, require other similarity parameters. First, the analytic equations for the oblique shock angle become nearly independent of Mach number at high (~&gt;10) Mach numbers. Second, the formation of strong shocks around aerodynamic bodies means that the freestream Reynolds number is less useful as an estimate of the behavior of the boundary layer over a body (although it is still important). Finally, the increased temperature of hypersonic flow mean that real gas effects become important. Research in hypersonics is therefore often called aerothermodynamics, rather than aerodynamics.

The introduction of real gas effects means that more variables are required to describe the full state of a gas. Whereas a stationary gas can be described by three variables (pressure, temperature, adiabatic index), and a moving gas by four (flow velocity), a hot gas in chemical equilibrium also requires state equations for the chemical components of the gas, and a gas in nonequilibrium solves those state equations using time as an extra variable. This means that for nonequilibrium flow, something between 10 and 100 variables may be required to describe the state of the gas at any given time. Additionally, rarefied hypersonic flows (usually defined as those with a Knudsen number above 0.1) do not follow the Navier–Stokes equations.

Hypersonic flows are typically categorized by their total energy, expressed as total enthalpy (MJ/kg), total pressure (kPa-MPa), stagnation pressure (kPa-MPa), stagnation temperature (K), or flow velocity (km/s).

Wallace D. Hayes developed a similarity parameter, similar to the Whitcomb area rule, which allowed similar configurations to be compared. In the study of hypersonic flow over slender bodies, the product of the freestream Mach number formula_1 and the flow deflection angle formula_2, known as the hypersonic similarity parameter:formula_3is considered to be an important governing parameter. The slenderness ratio of a vehicle formula_4, where formula_5 is the diameter and formula_6 is the length, is often substituted for formula_2.

==Regimes==
Hypersonic flow can be approximately separated into a number of regimes. The selection of these regimes is rough, due to the blurring of the boundaries where a particular effect can be found.

===Perfect gas===
In this regime, the gas can be regarded as an ideal gas. Flow in this regime is still Mach number dependent. Simulations start to depend on the use of a constant-temperature wall, rather than the adiabatic wall typically used at lower speeds. The lower border of this region is around Mach 5, where ramjets become inefficient, and the upper border around Mach 10–12.

===Two-temperature ideal gas===
This is a subset of the perfect gas regime, where the gas can be considered chemically perfect, but the rotational and vibrational temperatures of the gas must be considered separately, leading to two temperature models. See particularly the modeling of supersonic nozzles, where vibrational freezing becomes important.

===Dissociated gas===
In this regime, diatomic or polyatomic gases (the gases found in most atmospheres) begin to dissociate as they come into contact with the bow shock generated by the body. Surface catalysis plays a role in the calculation of surface heating, meaning that the type of surface material also has an effect on the flow. The lower border of this regime is where any component of a gas mixture first begins to dissociate in the stagnation point of a flow (which for nitrogen is around 2000 K). At the upper border of this regime, the effects of ionization start to have an effect on the flow.

===Ionized gas===
In this regime the ionized electron population of the stagnated flow becomes significant, and the electrons must be modeled separately. Often the electron temperature is handled separately from the temperature of the remaining gas components. This region occurs for freestream flow velocities around 3–4 km/s. Gases in this region are modeled as non-radiating plasmas.

===Radiation-dominated regime===
Above around 12 km/s, the heat transfer to a vehicle changes from being conductively dominated to radiatively dominated. The modeling of gases in this regime is split into two classes:
#Optically thin: where the gas does not re-absorb radiation emitted from other parts of the gas
#Optically thick: where the radiation must be considered a separate source of energy.
The modeling of optically thick gases is extremely difficult, since, due to the calculation of the radiation at each point, the computation load theoretically expands exponentially as the number of points considered increases.

<text>The Lockheed SR-71 &quot;Blackbird&quot; is a retired long-range, high-altitude, Mach 3+ strategic reconnaissance aircraft developed and manufactured by the American aerospace company Lockheed Corporation. Its nicknames include &quot;Blackbird&quot; and &quot;Habu&quot;.

The SR-71 was developed in the 1960s as a black project by Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson was responsible for many of the SR-71&#x27;s innovative concepts. Its shape was based on the Lockheed A-12, a pioneer in stealth technology with its reduced radar cross section, but the SR-71 was longer and heavier to carry more fuel and a crew of two in tandem cockpits. The SR-71 was revealed to the public in July 1964 and entered service in the United States Air Force (USAF) in January 1966.

During missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes (Mach 3.2 and ), allowing it to evade or outrace threats. If a surface-to-air missile launch was detected, the standard evasive action was to accelerate and outpace the missile. Equipment for the plane&#x27;s aerial reconnaissance missions included signals-intelligence sensors, side-looking airborne radar, and a camera. On average, an SR-71 could fly just once per week because of the lengthy preparations needed. A total of 32 aircraft were built; 12 were lost in accidents, none to enemy action.

In 1974, the SR-71 set the record for the quickest flight between London and New York. In 1976, it became the fastest airbreathing manned aircraft, previously held by its predecessor, the closely related Lockheed YF-12. , the Blackbird still holds all three world records. 

In 1989, the USAF retired the SR-71, largely for political reasons, although several were briefly reactivated before their second retirement in 1998. NASA was the final operator of the Blackbird, using it as a research platform, until it was retired again in 1999. Since its retirement, the SR-71&#x27;s role has been taken up by a combination of reconnaissance satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). As of 2018, Lockheed Martin was developing a proposed UAV successor, the SR-72, with plans to fly it in 2025.

==Development==

===Background===
Lockheed&#x27;s previous reconnaissance aircraft was the relatively slow U-2, designed for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In late 1957, the CIA approached the defense contractor Lockheed to build an undetectable spy plane. The project, named Archangel, was led by Kelly Johnson, head of Lockheed&#x27;s Skunk Works unit in Burbank, California. The work on project Archangel began in the second quarter of 1958, with aim of flying higher and faster than the U-2. Of 11 successive designs drafted in a span of 10 months, &quot;A-10&quot; was the front-runner, although its shape made it vulnerable to radar detection. After a meeting with the CIA in March 1959, the design was modified to reduce its radar cross-section by 90%. On 11 February 1960, the CIA approved a US$96 million (~$ in ) contract for Skunk Works to build a dozen A-12 spy planes. Three months later, the May 1960 downing of Francis Gary Powers&#x27;s U-2 underscored the need for less vulnerable reconnaissance aircraft.

The A-12 first flew at Groom Lake (Area 51), Nevada, on 25 April 1962. Thirteen were built, plus five more of two variants: three of the YF-12 interceptor prototype and two of the M-21 drone carrier. The aircraft was to be powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney J58 engine, but J58 development was taking longer than scheduled, so it was initially equipped with the lower-thrust Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 to enable flight testing to begin. The J58s were retrofitted as they became available, and became the standard engine for all subsequent aircraft in the series (A-12, YF-12, M-21), as well as the SR-71. The A-12 flew missions over Vietnam and North Korea before its retirement in 1968. The program&#x27;s cancellation was announced on 28 December 1966, due both to budget concerns and because of the forthcoming SR-71, a derivative of the A-12.

===Designation as SR-71===
The SR-71 designation is a continuation of the pre-1962 bomber series; the last aircraft built using the series was the XB-70 Valkyrie. However, a bomber variant of the Blackbird was briefly given the B-71 designator, which was retained when the type was changed to SR-71.

During the later stages of its testing, the B-70 was proposed for a reconnaissance/strike role, with an &quot;RS-70&quot; designation. When the A-12&#x27;s performance potential was clearly found to be much greater, the USAF ordered a variant of the A-12 in December 1962, which was originally named R-12 by Lockheed. This USAF version was longer and heavier than the original A-12 because it had a longer fuselage to hold more fuel. The R-12 also had a crew of two in tandem cockpits, and reshaped fuselage chines. Reconnaissance equipment included signals intelligence sensors, a side-looking airborne radar, and a photo camera. The CIA&#x27;s A-12 was a better photo-reconnaissance platform than the USAF&#x27;s R-12: since the A-12 flew higher and faster, and with only a pilot, it had room to carry a better camera and more instruments. The A-12 flew covert missions while the SR-71 flew overt missions; the latter had USAF markings and pilots carried Geneva Conventions Identification Cards.

During the 1964 campaign, Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater repeatedly criticized President Lyndon B. Johnson and his administration for falling behind the Soviet Union in developing new weapons. Johnson decided to counter this criticism by revealing the existence of the YF-12A USAF interceptor, which also served as cover for the still-secret A-12 and the USAF reconnaissance model since July 1964. USAF Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation and wanted the RS-71 to be named SR-71. Before the July speech, LeMay lobbied to modify Johnson&#x27;s speech to read &quot;SR-71&quot; instead of &quot;RS-71&quot;. The media transcript given to the press at the time still had the earlier RS-71 designation in places, creating the story that the president had misread the aircraft&#x27;s designation. To conceal the A-12&#x27;s existence, Johnson referred only to the A-11, while revealing the existence of a high-speed, high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft.

In 1968, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara canceled the F-12 interceptor program. The specialized tooling used to manufacture both the YF-12 and the SR-71 was also ordered destroyed. Production of the SR-71 totaled 32 aircraft: 29 SR-71As, two SR-71Bs, and one SR-71C.

==Design==

===Overview===
The SR-71 was designed for flight at over Mach 3 with tandem cockpits for a crew of two: a pilot; and a reconnaissance systems officer who navigated and operated the surveillance systems. It was extremely important for the pilot and RSO to work well together as a crew. The SR-71 was designed with the smallest radar cross-section that Lockheed could achieve, an early attempt at stealth design. Aircraft were painted black. This color radiated heat from the surface more effectively than the bare metal, reducing the temperature of the skin and thermal stresses on the airframe. The appearance of the painted aircraft gave it the nickname &quot;Blackbird&quot;.

===Airframe, canopy, and landing gear===
Titanium was used for 85% of the structure, with much of the rest being polymer composite materials. To control costs, Lockheed used a more easily worked titanium alloy, which softened at a lower temperature. The challenges posed led Lockheed to develop new fabrication methods, which have since been used in the manufacture of other aircraft. Lockheed found that washing welded titanium requires distilled water, as the chlorine present in tap water is corrosive; cadmium-plated tools could not be used, as they also caused corrosion. Metallurgical contamination was another problem; at one point, 80% of the delivered titanium for manufacture was rejected on these grounds.

The high temperatures generated in flight required special design and operating techniques. Major sections of the skin of the inboard wings were corrugated, not smooth. Aerodynamicists initially opposed the concept, disparagingly referring to the aircraft as a Mach 3 variant of the 1920s-era Ford Trimotor, which was known for its corrugated aluminum skin. But high heat would have caused a smooth skin to split or curl, whereas the corrugated skin could expand vertically and horizontally and had increased longitudinal strength.

Fuselage panels were manufactured to fit only loosely with the aircraft on the ground. Proper alignment was achieved as the airframe heated up, with thermal expansion of several inches. Because of this, and the lack of a fuel-sealing system that could remain leak-free with the extreme temperature cycles during flight, the aircraft leaked JP-7 fuel on the ground prior to takeoff, annoying ground crews.

The outer windscreen of the cockpit was made of three layers of glass with cooling sections between them. The ANS navigation window was made of solid quartz and was fused ultrasonically to the titanium frame. The temperature of the exterior of the windscreen could reach during a mission.
The Blackbird&#x27;s tires, manufactured by B.F. Goodrich, contained aluminum and were inflated with nitrogen. They cost $2,300 each and generally required replacing within 20 missions. The Blackbird landed at more than and deployed a drag parachute to reduce landing roll and brake and tire wear.

===Shape and threat avoidance===
The SR-71 was the second operational aircraft, after the Lockheed A-12, designed to be hard to spot on radar. Early studies in stealth technology indicated that a shape with flattened, tapering sides would reflect most radar energy away from a beam&#x27;s place of origin, so Lockheed&#x27;s engineers added chines and canted the vertical control surfaces inward. Special radar-absorbing materials were incorporated into sawtooth-shaped sections of the aircraft&#x27;s skin. Cesium-based fuel additives were used to somewhat reduce the visibility of exhaust plumes to radar, although exhaust streams remained quite apparent. Ultimately, engineers produced an aircraft with a wing area of about but a radar cross-section (RCS) of around . Johnson later conceded that Soviet radar technology advanced faster than the stealth technology employed against it.

While the SR-71 carried radar countermeasures to evade interception efforts, its greatest protection was its combination of high altitude and very high speed, which made it invulnerable at the time. Along with its low radar cross-section, these qualities gave a very short time for an enemy surface-to-air missile (SAM) site to acquire and track the aircraft on radar. By the time the SAM site could track the SR-71, it was often too late to launch a SAM, and the SR-71 would be out of range before the SAM could catch up to it. If the SAM site could track the SR-71 and fire a SAM in time, the SAM would expend nearly all of the delta-v of its boost and sustainer phases just reaching the SR-71&#x27;s altitude; at this point, out of thrust, it could do little more than follow its ballistic arc. Merely accelerating would typically be enough for an SR-71 to evade a SAM; changes by the pilots in the SR-71&#x27;s speed, altitude, and heading were also often enough to spoil any radar lock on the plane by SAM sites or enemy fighters. At sustained speeds of more than Mach 3.2, the plane was faster than the Soviet Union&#x27;s fastest interceptor, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25, which also could not reach the SR-71&#x27;s altitude. No SR-71 was ever shot down.

The SR-71 featured chines, a pair of sharp edges leading aft from either side of the nose along the fuselage. These were not a feature on the early A-3 design; Frank Rodgers, a doctor at the Scientific Engineering Institute, a CIA front organization, discovered that a cross-section of a sphere had a greatly reduced radar reflection, and adapted a cylindrical-shaped fuselage by stretching out the sides of the fuselage. After the advisory panel provisionally selected Convair&#x27;s FISH design over the A-3 on the basis of RCS, Lockheed adopted chines for its A-4 through A-6 designs.

Aerodynamicists discovered that the chines generated powerful vortices and created additional lift, leading to unexpected aerodynamic performance improvements. For example, they allowed a reduction in the wings&#x27; angle of incidence, which added stability and reduced drag at high speeds, allowing more weight to be carried, such as fuel. Landing speeds were also reduced, as the chines&#x27; vortices created turbulent flow over the wings at high angles of attack, making it harder to stall. The chines also acted like leading-edge extensions, which increase the agility of fighters such as the F-5, F-16, F/A-18, MiG-29, and Su-27. The addition of chines also allowed the removal of the planned canard foreplanes.

===Propulsion system or powerplant===
====Complete powerplant====
The SR-71 used the same powerplant as the A-12 and YF-12. It consists of three main parts: inlet, J58 engine and its nacelle, and ejector nozzle. &quot;Typical for any supersonic powerplant the engine cannot be considered separately from the rest of the powerplant. Rather, it may be regarded as the heat pump in the over-all system of inlet, engine, and nozzle. The net thrust available to propel the aircraft may be to a large extent controlled by the performance of the inlet and nozzle rather than by the physical potentialities of the engine alone.&quot; This is illustrated for the Blackbird by the thrust contributions from each component at Mach 3+ with maximum afterburner: inlet 54%, engine 17.6%, ejector nozzle 28.4%.

When stationary and at low speeds the inlet caused a loss in engine thrust. This was due to the flow restriction through the inlet when stationary. Thrust was recovered with ram pressure as flight speed increased (uninstalled thrust 34,000 lb, installed at zero airspeed 25,500 lb rising through 30,000 lb at 210 knots, unstick speed).

At supersonic speeds not all the airflow approaching the inlet capture area entered the inlet. At supersonic speeds an intake always adapts to the engine requirements, rather than forcing air into the engine, and the unwanted air flows around the outside of the cowl, causing spillage drag. More than half the air approaching the capture area had to be spilled at low supersonic speeds and the amount reduced as the design speed was approached because the inlet airflow had been designed to match the engine demand at that speed and the chosen design point ambient temperature. At this speed the spike shock touched the cowl lip and there was minimal spillage (with its attendant drag) as shown by Campbell. The inlet and engine matching was also shown by Brown, who emphasized the benefit of increased engine airflow at higher Mach numbers that came with the introduction of the bleed bypass cycle. These two authors show the disparity between inlet and engine for the Blackbird in terms of airflow and it is further explained in more general terms by Oates.

Engine operation was adversely affected when operating behind an unstarted inlet. In this condition the inlet behaved like a subsonic inlet design (known as a pitot type) at high supersonic speeds, with very low airflow to the engine. Fuel was automatically diverted, by the fuel derich system, from the combustor to prevent turbine over-temperature.

All three parts were linked by the secondary airflow. The inlet needed the boundary layers removed from its spike and cowl surfaces. The one with the higher pressure recovery, the cowl shock-trap bleed, was chosen as secondary air to ventilate and cool the outside of the engine. It was assisted from the inlet by the pumping action of the engine exhaust in the ejector nozzle, cushioning the engine exhaust as it expanded over a wide range of pressure ratios which increased with flight speed.

Mach 3.2 in a standard day atmosphere was the design point for the aircraft. However, in practice the SR-71 was more efficient at even faster speeds and colder temperatures. The specific range charts showed for a standard day temperature, and a particular weight, that Mach 3.0 cruise used 38,000 lb per hour of fuel. At 3.15 Mach the fuel flow was 36,000 lb/hr. Flying in colder temperatures (known as temperature deviations from the standard day) would also reduce the fuel used, e.g. with a -10 °C temperature the fuel flow was 35,000 lb/hr. During one mission, SR-71 pilot Brian Shul flew faster than usual to avoid multiple interception attempts. It was discovered after the flight that this had reduced the fuel consumption. It is possible to match the powerplant for optimum performance at only one ambient temperature because the airflows for a supersonic inlet and engine vary differently with ambient temperature. For an inlet, the airflow varies inversely with the square root of the temperature, and for the engine, it varies with the direct inverse.

====Inlet====
The engine inlets needed internal supersonic diffusion since external compression used on slower aircraft caused too much drag at Blackbird speeds. Their features included a centerbody or spike, spike boundary-layer bleed slots where normal shock was located, a cowl boundary layer bleed &quot;shock trap&quot; entrance, streamlined bodies known as &quot;mice&quot;, forward bypass bleed ports between the &quot;mice&quot;, rear bypass ring, louvers on external surface for spike boundary layer overboard, and louvers on external surface for front bypass overboard. Venting this bypass overboard produced high drag: 6,000 lb at cruise with 50% door opening, compared to the total aircraft drag of 14,000 lb. Designer David Campbell holds a patent on the inlet&#x27;s aerodynamic features and functioning, which are explained in the &quot;A-12 Utility Flight Manual&quot; and in a 2014 presentation by Lockheed Technical Fellow Emeritus Tom Anderson.

When an inlet was operating as an efficient supersonic compressor—a status called &quot;started&quot;—supersonic diffusion took place in front of the cowl and internally in a converging passage as far as a terminal shock where the passage area began to increase and subsonic diffusion takes place. An analog control system was designed to hold the terminal shock in position. 

But in the early years of operation, the analog computers could not always keep up with rapidly changing inputs from the nose boom. If the duct back pressure became too great and the spike was incorrectly positioned, the shock wave become unstable and would shoot quickly forward to a stable position outside the cowl. This &quot;inlet unstart&quot; would often extinguish the engine&#x27;s afterburner. The asymmetrical thrust from the other engine would cause the aircraft to yaw violently. SAS, autopilot, and manual control inputs would attempt to regain controlled flight, but extreme yaw would often reduce airflow in the opposite engine and stimulate &quot;sympathetic stalls&quot;. This generated a rapid counter-yawing, often coupled with loud &quot;banging&quot; noises, and a rough ride during which crews&#x27; helmets would sometimes strike their cockpit canopies. One response to a single unstart was unstarting both inlets to prevent yawing, then restarting them both. After wind-tunnel testing and computer modeling by NASA Dryden test center, Lockheed installed an electronic control to detect unstart conditions and perform this reset action without pilot intervention.

During troubleshooting of the unstart issue, NASA discovered that the vortices from the nose chines were entering the engine and reducing engine efficiency. To fix this, the agency developed a computer to control the engine bypass doors. Beginning in 1980, the analog inlet control system was replaced by a digital system, Digital Automatic Flight and Inlet Control System (DAFICS), which reduced unstarts.

====Engine and nacelle====

The engine was an extensively re-designed version of the J58-P2, an existing supersonic engine which had run 700 development hours in support of proposals to power various aircraft for the U.S. Navy. Only the compressor and turbine aerodynamics were retained. New design requirements for cruise at Mach 3.2 included:
* operating with very high ram temperature air entering the compressor, at 
* a continuous turbine temperature capability hotter than previous experience (Pratt &amp; Whitney J75)
* continuous use of maximum afterburning
* the use of new, more expensive, materials and fluids required to withstand unprecedented high temperatures

The engine was an afterburning turbojet for take-off and transonic flight (bleed bypass closed) and a low bypass augmented turbofan for supersonic acceleration (bleed bypass open). It approximated a ramjet during high speed supersonic cruise (with a pressure loss, compressor to exhaust, of 80% which was typical of a ramjet). It was a low bypass turbofan for subsonic loiter (bleed bypass open).

Analysis of the J58-P2 supersonic performance showed the high compressor inlet temperature would have caused stalling, choking and blade breakages in the compressor as a result of operating at low corrected speeds on the compressor map. These problems were resolved by Pratt &amp; Whitney engineer Robert Abernethy and are explained in his patent, &quot;Recover Bleed Air Turbojet&quot;. His solution was to 1) incorporate six air-bleed tubes, prominent on the outside of the engine, to transfer 20% of the compressor air to the afterburner, and 2) to modify the inlet guide vanes with a 2-position, trailing edge flap. The compressor bleed enabled the compressor to operate more efficiently and with the resulting increase in engine airflow matched the inlet design flow with an installed thrust increase of 47%. A continuous turbine temperature of was enabled with air-cooled first stage turbine vane and blades. Continuous operation of maximum afterburning was enabled by passing relatively cool air from the compressor along the inner surface of the duct and nozzle. Ceramic thermal barrier coatings were also used.

The secondary airflow through the nacelle comes from the cowl boundary layer bleed system which is oversized (flows more than boundary layer) to give a high enough pressure recovery to support the ejector pumping action. Additional air comes from the rear bypass doors and, for low speed operation with negligible inlet ram, from suck-in doors by the compressor case.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Ejector Nozzle====
The nozzle had to operate efficiently over a wide range of pressure ratios from low, with no inlet ram with a stationary aircraft, to 31 times the external pressure at . A blow-in door ejector nozzle had been invented by Pratt &amp; Whitney engineer Stuart Hamilton in the late 1950s and described in his patent &quot;Variable Area Exhaust Nozzle&quot;. In this description the nozzle is an integral part of the engine (as it was in the contemporary Mach 3 General Electric YJ93. For the Blackbird powerplant the nozzle was more efficient structurally (lighter) by incorporating it as part of the airframe because it carried fin and wing loads through the ejector shroud. The nozzle used secondary air from two sources, the inlet cowl boundary layer and rear bypass from immediately in front of the compressor. It used external flow on the nacelle through the tertiary blow-in doors until ram closed them at Mach 1.5. Only secondary air was used at higher speeds with the blow-in doors closed.

At low flight speeds the engine exhaust pressure at the primary nozzle exit was greater than ambient so tended to over-expand to lower than ambient in the shroud causing impingement shocks. Secondary and blow-in door air surrounding the exhaust cushioned it preventing over-expansion. Inlet ram pressure increased with flight speed and the higher pressure in the exhaust system closed, first the blow-in doors and then started to open the nozzle flaps until they were fully open at Mach 2.4. The final nozzle area did not increase with further increase in flight speed (for complete expansion to ambient and greater internal thrust) because its external diameter, greater than nacelle diameter would cause too much drag.

=== Fuel ===

JP-7 fuel was used. It was difficult to ignite. To start the engines, triethylborane (TEB), which ignites on contact with air, was injected to produce temperatures high enough to ignite the JP-7. The TEB produced a characteristic green flame, which could often be seen during engine ignition. The fuel was used as a heat sink for the rest of the aircraft to cool the pilot and the electronics. An electric starting system was not possible due to the limited capacity of the cooling system, so the chemical ignition system was used.

On a typical mission, the SR-71 took off with a partial fuel load to reduce stress on the brakes and tires during takeoff and also ensure it could successfully take off should one engine fail. Within 20 seconds, the aircraft traveled , reached , and lifted off. It reached of altitude in less than two minutes, and the typical cruising altitude in another 17 minutes, having used one third of its fuel. It is a common misconception that the planes refueled shortly after takeoff because the fuel tanks, which formed the outer skin of the aircraft, leaked on the ground. It was not possible to prevent leaks when the aircraft skin was cold and the tanks only sealed when the skin warmed as the aircraft speed increased. The ability of the sealant to prevent leaks was compromised by the expansion and contraction of the skin with each flight. However, the amount of fuel that leaked, measured as drops per minute on the ground from specific locations, was not enough to make refueling necessary.

The SR-71 also required in-flight refueling to replenish fuel during long-duration missions. Supersonic flights generally lasted no more than 90 minutes before the pilot had to find a tanker.

Specialized KC-135Q tankers were required to refuel the SR-71. The KC-135Q had a modified high-speed boom, which would allow refueling of the Blackbird at near the tanker&#x27;s maximum airspeed. The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving JP-4 (for the KC-135Q itself) and JP-7 (for the SR-71) between different tanks. As an aid to the pilot when refueling, the cockpit was fitted with a peripheral vision horizon display. This unusual instrument projected a barely visible artificial horizon line across the top of the entire instrument panel, which gave the pilot subliminal cues on aircraft attitude. If a KC-135Q was not available any tanker with JP-4 or JP-5 could be used in an emergency to avoid losing the aircraft, but with a Mach 1.5 speed limit.

On hot days, when approaching the maximum fuel load of , the left engine had to be run with minimum afterburner to maintain probe contact.

===Astro-inertial navigation system===
Nortronics, Northrop Corporation&#x27;s electronics development division, had developed an astro-inertial guidance system (ANS), which could correct inertial navigation system errors with celestial observations, for the SM-62 Snark missile, and a separate system for the ill-fated AGM-48 Skybolt missile, the latter of which was adapted for the SR-71.

Before takeoff, a primary alignment brought the ANS&#x27;s inertial components to a high degree of accuracy. In flight, the ANS, which sat behind the reconnaissance systems officer&#x27;s (RSO&#x27;s), position, tracked stars through a circular quartz glass window on the upper fuselage. Its &quot;blue light&quot; source star tracker, which could see stars during both day and night, would continuously track a variety of stars as the aircraft&#x27;s changing position brought them into view. The system&#x27;s digital computer ephemeris contained data on a list of stars used for celestial navigation: the list first included 56 stars and was later expanded to 61. The ANS could supply altitude and position to flight controls and other systems, including the mission data recorder, automatic navigation to preset destination points, automatic pointing and control of cameras and sensors, and optical or SLR sighting of fixed points loaded into the ANS before takeoff. According to Richard Graham, a former SR-71 pilot, the navigation system was good enough to limit drift to off the direction of travel at Mach 3.

===Sensors and payloads===
The SR-71 originally included optical/infrared imagery systems; side-looking airborne radar (SLAR); electronic intelligence (ELINT) gathering systems; defensive systems for countering missile and airborne fighters; and recorders for SLAR, ELINT, and maintenance data. The SR-71 carried a Fairchild tracking camera and an infrared camera, both of which ran during the entire mission.

As the SR-71 had a second cockpit behind the pilot for the RSO, it could not carry the A-12&#x27;s principal sensor, a single large-focal-length optical camera that sat in the &quot;Q-Bay&quot; behind the A-12&#x27;s single cockpit. Instead, the SR-71&#x27;s camera systems could be located either in the fuselage chines or the removable nose/chine section. Wide-area imaging was provided by two of Itek&#x27;s Operational Objective Cameras, which provided stereo imagery across the width of the flight track, or an Itek Optical Bar Camera, which gave continuous horizon-to-horizon coverage. A closer view of the target area was given by the HYCON Technical Objective Camera (TEOC), which could be directed up to 45° left or right of the centerline. Initially, the TEOCs could not match the resolution of the A-12&#x27;s larger camera, but rapid improvements in both the camera and film improved this performance.

SLAR, built by Goodyear Aerospace, could be carried in the removable nose. In later life, the radar was replaced by Loral&#x27;s Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar System (ASARS-1). Both the first SLAR and ASARS-1 were ground-mapping imaging systems, collecting data either in fixed swaths left or right of centerline or from a spot location for higher resolution. ELINT-gathering systems, called the Electro Magnetic Reconnaissance System, built by AIL could be carried in the chine bays to analyze electronic signal fields being passed through, and were programmed to identify items of interest.

Over its operational life, the Blackbird carried various electronic countermeasures (ECMs), including warning and active electronic systems built by several ECM companies and called Systems A, A2, A2C, B, C, C2, E, G, H, and M. On a given mission, an aircraft carried several of these frequency/purpose payloads to meet the expected threats. Major Jerry Crew, an RSO, told &quot;Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian&quot; that he used a jammer to try to confuse surface-to-air missile sites as their crews tracked his airplane, but once his threat-warning receiver told him a missile had been launched, he switched off the jammer to prevent the missile from homing in on its signal. After landing, information from the SLAR, ELINT gathering systems, and the maintenance data recorder were subjected to postflight ground analysis. In the later years of its operational life, a datalink system could send ASARS-1 and ELINT data from about of track coverage to a suitably equipped ground station.

===Life support===

Flying at meant that crews could not use standard masks, which could not provide enough oxygen above . Specialized protective pressurized suits were produced for crew members by the David Clark Company for the A-12, YF-12, M-21 and SR-71. Furthermore, an emergency ejection at Mach 3.2 would subject crews to temperatures of about ; thus, during a high-altitude ejection scenario, an onboard oxygen supply would keep the suit pressurized during the descent.

The cockpit could be pressurized to an altitude of during flight. The cabin needed a heavy-duty cooling system, as cruising at Mach 3.2 would heat the aircraft&#x27;s external surface well beyond &lt;ref name=&quot;PM06/91&quot;&gt;&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, June 1991, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and the inside of the windshield to . An air conditioner used a heat exchanger to dump heat from the cockpit into the fuel prior to combustion. The same air-conditioning system was also used to keep the front (nose) landing gear bay cool, thereby eliminating the need for the special aluminum-impregnated tires similar to those used on the main landing gear.

Blackbird pilots and RSOs were provided with food and drink for the long reconnaissance flights. Water bottles had long straws which crewmembers guided into an opening in the helmet by looking in a mirror. Food was contained in sealed containers similar to toothpaste tubes which delivered food to the crewmember&#x27;s mouth through the helmet opening.

==Operational history==
===Main era===
The first flight of an SR-71 took place on 22 December 1964, at USAF Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, piloted by Bob Gilliland. The SR-71 reached a top speed of Mach 3.4 during flight testing, with pilot Major Brian Shul reporting a speed in excess of Mach 3.5 on an operational sortie while evading a missile over Libya. The first SR-71 to enter service was delivered to the 4200th (later, 9th) Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base, California, in January 1966.

SR-71s first arrived at the 9th SRW&#x27;s Operating Location (OL-8) at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan on 8 March 1968. These deployments were code-named &quot;Glowing Heat&quot;, while the program as a whole was code-named &quot;Senior Crown&quot;. Reconnaissance missions over North Vietnam were code-named &quot;Black Shield&quot; and then renamed &quot;Giant Scale&quot; in late 1968. On 21 March 1968, Major (later General) Jerome F. O&#x27;Malley and Major Edward D. Payne flew the first operational SR-71 sortie in SR-71 serial number from Kadena AFB, Okinawa. During its career, this aircraft (976) accumulated 2,981 flying hours and flew 942 total sorties (more than any other SR-71), including 257 operational missions, from Beale AFB; Palmdale, California; Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan; and RAF Mildenhall, UK. The aircraft was flown to the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio in March 1990.

The USAF could fly each SR-71, on average, once per week, because of the extended turnaround required after mission recovery. Very often an aircraft would return with rivets missing, delaminated panels or other broken parts such as inlets requiring repair or replacement. There were cases of the aircraft not being ready to fly again for a month due to the repairs needed. Rob Vermeland, Lockheed Martin&#x27;s manager of Advanced Development Program, said in an interview in 2015 that high-tempo operations were not realistic for the SR-71. &quot;If we had one sitting in the hangar here and the crew chief was told there was a mission planned right now, then 19 hours later it would be safely ready to take off.&quot;

From the beginning of the Blackbird&#x27;s reconnaissance missions over North Vietnam and Laos in 1968, the SR-71s averaged approximately one sortie a week for nearly two years. By 1970, the SR-71s were averaging two sorties per week, and by 1972, they were flying nearly one sortie every day. Two SR-71s were lost during these missions, one in 1970 and the second aircraft in 1972, both due to mechanical malfunctions. Over the course of its reconnaissance missions during the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese fired approximately 800 SAMs at SR-71s, none of which managed to score a hit. Pilots did report that missiles launched without radar guidance and no launch detection, had passed as close as from the aircraft.
While deployed at Okinawa, the SR-71s and their aircrew members gained the nickname Habu (as did the A-12s preceding them) after a pit viper indigenous to Japan, which the Okinawans thought the plane resembled.

Operational highlights for the entire Blackbird family (YF-12, A-12, and SR-71) as of about 1990 included:
*3,551 mission sorties flown
*17,300 total sorties flown
*11,008 mission flight hours
*53,490 total flight hours
*2,752 hours Mach 3 time (missions)
*11,675 hours Mach 3 time (total)

Only one crew member, Jim Zwayer, a Lockheed flight-test reconnaissance and navigation systems specialist, was killed in a flight accident. The rest of the crew members ejected safely or evacuated their aircraft on the ground.

An SR-71 was used domestically in 1971 to assist the FBI in their manhunt for the skyjacker D.B. Cooper. The Blackbird was to retrace and photograph the flightpath of the hijacked 727 from Seattle to Reno and attempt to locate any of the items that Cooper was known to have parachuted with from the aircraft. Five flights were attempted but on each occasion no photographs of the flight path were obtained due to low visibility.

==== European flights ====
European operations were flown from RAF Mildenhall, England, with two weekly routes. One was along the Norwegian west coast and up the Kola Peninsula, monitoring several large naval bases belonging to the Soviet Navy&#x27;s Northern Fleet. Over the years, there were several emergency landings in Norway, four in Bodø and two of them in 1981, flying from Beale, in 1985. Rescue parties were sent in to repair the planes before leaving. On one occasion, one complete wing with engine was replaced as the easiest way to get the plane airborne again.
The other route was known as the &quot;Baltic Express&quot;, which started from Mildenhall and went through Jutland and the Danish straits before going out over the Baltic Sea. At the time, the USSR controlled the airspace from the DDR to the Gulf of Finland, with Finland and Sweden pursuing neutrality in the Cold War. This meant that NATO aircraft entering the Baltic Sea had to fly through a narrow corridor of international airspace between Scania and Western Pomerania, which was monitored by both the Swedish and Soviet Air Forces. Starting a counter-clockwise 30-minute loop, the Blackbirds would then reconnoiter along the Soviet Union&#x27;s coastal border, before slowing down to Mach 2.54 to make a left turn south of Åland, and then follow the Swedish coast back towards Denmark. If the SR-71s attempted the turn at Mach 3, they could end up violating Swedish airspace, and the Swedes would direct Viggens to intercept the offending aircraft.

The combination of a monitored entry point and a fixed route allowed the Swedes and the Soviets a chance to scramble interceptors. Swedish radar stations would observe the 15th Air Army dispatch Su-15s from Latvia, and MiG-21s and MiG-23s from Estonia, although only the Sukhois would have even a slim chance of successfully intercepting the American aircraft. The greater Soviet threat came from the MiG-25s stationed at Finow-Eberswalde in the DDR. The Swedes noted that the Soviets usually would send a single MiG-25 &quot;Foxbat&quot; from Finow to intercept the SR-71 on their way back out of the Baltic Sea. With the Blackbird flying at , the Foxbat would regularly close to an altitude of , precisely behind the SR-71, before disengaging. The Swedes interpreted this regularity as a sign that the MiG-25 had successfully simulated a shoot-down.

The Swedes themselves would typically assert their neutrality by dispatching Saab 37 Viggens from Ängelholm, Norrköping or Ronneby. Limited by a top speed of Mach 2.1 and a service ceiling of , the Viggen pilots would line up for a frontal attack, and rely on their state-of-the-art avionics to climb at the right time and attain a missile lock on the SR-71. Precise timing and target illumination would be maintained with target location data supplied to the Viggen&#x27;s fire-control computer from ground-based radars, with the most common site for the lock-on being the thin stretch of international airspace between Öland and Gotland. Out of 322 recorded Baltic Express sorties between 1977 and 1988, the Swedish Air Force claims that they succeeded in attaining missile lock on the SR-71 in 51 of them. However, with a combined closing speed of Mach 5, the Swedes were reliant on the Blackbird not changing course.
On 29 June 1987, an SR-71 was on a mission around the Baltic Sea to spy on Soviet postings when one of the engines exploded. The aircraft, which was at altitude, quickly lost altitude and turned 180° to the left and turned over Gotland to search for the Swedish coast. Thus, Swedish airspace was violated, whereupon two unarmed Saab JA 37 Viggens on an exercise at the height of Västervik were ordered there. The mission was to do an incident preparedness check and identify an aircraft of high interest. It was found that the plane was in obvious distress and a decision was made that the Swedish Air Force would escort the plane out of the Baltic Sea. A second round of armed JA-37s from Ängelholm replaced the first pair and completed the escort to Danish airspace. The event had been classified for over 30 years, and when the report was unsealed, data from the NSA showed that multiple MiG-25s with the order to shoot down the SR-71 or force it to land, had started right after the engine failure. A MiG-25 had locked a missile on the damaged SR-71, but as the aircraft was under escort, no missiles were fired. On 28 November 2018, the four Swedish pilots involved were awarded medals from the USAF.

===Initial retirement===
The two most widely proposed reasons for the SR-71&#x27;s retirement in 1989, offered by the Air Force to Congress, were that the plane was too expensive to build and maintain, and had been rendered redundant by other evolving reconnaissance methods, such as unmanned vehicles (UAVs) and satellites. Another view held by officers and legislators is that the SR-71 was terminated due to Pentagon politics.

In 1996, a former 1st-SRS and 9th-SRW commander, Graham, presented a strongly supported opinion that the SR-71 provided some intelligence capabilities that none of its alternatives could provide in the 1990s, when the SR-71 was retired. Opinion remained divided as to how crucial, or disposable, those unique advantages properly were.

Graham noted that in the 1970s and early 1980s, to be selected into the SR-71 program, a pilot or navigator (RSO) had to be a top-quality USAF officer, so SR-71 squadron and wing commanders often pursued career advancement with promotion into higher positions within the USAF and the Pentagon. These generals were adept at communicating the value of the SR-71 to a USAF command staff and a Congress who often lacked a basic understanding of how the SR-71 worked and what it did. However, by the mid-1980s, these &quot;SR-71 generals&quot; all had retired, and a new generation of USAF generals had come to believe that the SR-71 had become redundant, and wanted to pursue newer, top secret programs like the new B-2 Spirit strategic bomber program. Graham said that the last-mentioned one was only a sales pitch, not a fact, at the time in the 1990s.

The USAF may have seen the SR-71 as a bargaining chip to ensure the survival of other priorities. Also, the SR-71 program&#x27;s &quot;product&quot;, which was operational and strategic intelligence, was not seen by these generals as being very valuable to the USAF. The primary consumers of this intelligence were the CIA, NSA, and DIA. A general misunderstanding of the nature of aerial reconnaissance and a lack of knowledge about the SR-71 in particular (due to its secretive development and operations) was used by detractors to discredit the aircraft, with the assurance given that a replacement was under development. Dick Cheney told the Senate Appropriations Committee that the SR-71 cost $85,000 per hour to operate. Opponents estimated the aircraft&#x27;s support cost at $400 to $700 million per year, though the cost was actually closer to $300 million.

The SR-71, while much more capable than the Lockheed U-2 in terms of range, speed, and survivability, suffered the lack of a data link, which the U-2 had been upgraded to carry. This meant that much of the SR-71&#x27;s imagery and radar data could not be used in real time, but had to wait until the aircraft returned to base. This lack of immediate real-time capability was used as one of the justifications to close down the program. The counterargument was that the longer the SR-71 was not upgraded as aggressively as it ought to have been, the more people could say that it was obsolescent, which was in their interest as champions of other programs (a self-fulfilling bias). Attempts to add a datalink to the SR-71 were stymied early on by the same factions in the Pentagon and Congress who were already set on the program&#x27;s demise, even in the early 1980s. These same factions also forced expensive sensor upgrades to the SR-71, which did little to increase its mission capabilities, but could be used as justification for complaining about the cost of the program.

In 1988, Congress was convinced to allocate $160,000 to keep six SR-71s and a trainer model in flyable storage that could become flightworthy within 60 days. However, the USAF refused to spend the money. While the SR-71 survived attempts to retire it in 1988, partly due to the unmatched ability to provide high-quality coverage of the Kola Peninsula for the US Navy, the decision to retire the SR-71 from active duty came in 1989, with the last missions flown in October that year. Four months after the plane&#x27;s retirement, General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., was told that the expedited reconnaissance, which the SR-71 could have provided, was unavailable during Operation Desert Storm.

The SR-71 program&#x27;s main operational capabilities came to a close at the end of fiscal year 1989 (October 1989). The 1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (1 SRS) kept its pilots and aircraft operational and active, and flew some operational reconnaissance missions through the end of 1989 and into 1990, due to uncertainty over the timing of the final termination of funding for the program. The squadron finally closed in mid-1990, and the aircraft were distributed to static display locations, with a number kept in reserve storage.

===Reactivation===

Due to unease over political situations in the Middle East and North Korea, the U.S. Congress re-examined the SR-71 beginning in 1993. Rear Admiral Thomas F. Hall addressed the question of why the SR-71 was retired, saying it was under &quot;the belief that, given the time delay associated with mounting a mission, conducting a reconnaissance, retrieving the data, processing it, and getting it out to a field commander, that you had a problem in timelines that was not going to meet the tactical requirements on the modern battlefield. And the determination was that if one could take advantage of technology and develop a system that could get that data back real time... that would be able to meet the unique requirements of the tactical commander.&quot; Hall also stated they were &quot;looking at alternative means of doing [the job of the SR-71].&quot;

Macke told the committee that they were &quot;flying U-2s, RC-135s, [and] other strategic and tactical assets&quot; to collect information in some areas. Senator Robert Byrd and other senators complained that the &quot;better than&quot; successor to the SR-71 had yet to be developed at the cost of the &quot;good enough&quot; serviceable aircraft. They maintained that, in a time of constrained military budgets, designing, building, and testing an aircraft with the same capabilities as the SR-71 would be impossible.

Congress&#x27;s disappointment with the lack of a suitable replacement for the Blackbird was cited concerning whether to continue funding imaging sensors on the U-2. Congressional conferees stated the &quot;experience with the SR-71 serves as a reminder of the pitfalls of failing to keep existing systems up-to-date and capable in the hope of acquiring other capabilities.&quot; It was agreed to add $100 million to the budget to return three SR-71s to service, but it was emphasized that this &quot;would not prejudice support for long-endurance UAVs&quot; [such as the Global Hawk]. The funding was later cut to $72.5 million. The Skunk Works was able to return the aircraft to service under budget at $72 million.

Retired USAF Colonel Jay Murphy was made the Program Manager for Lockheed&#x27;s reactivation plans. Retired USAF Colonels Don Emmons and Barry MacKean were put under government contract to remake the plane&#x27;s logistic and support structure. Still-active USAF pilots and Reconnaissance Systems Officers (RSOs) who had worked with the aircraft were asked to volunteer to fly the reactivated planes. The aircraft was under the command and control of the 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base and flew out of a renovated hangar at Edwards Air Force Base. Modifications were made to provide a data-link with &quot;near real-time&quot; transmission of the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar&#x27;s imagery to sites on the ground.

===Final retirement===
The reactivation met much resistance: the USAF had not budgeted for the aircraft, and UAV developers worried that their programs would suffer if money was shifted to support the SR-71s. Also, with the allocation requiring yearly reaffirmation by Congress, long-term planning for the SR-71 was difficult. In 1996, the USAF claimed that specific funding had not been authorized, and moved to ground the program. Congress reauthorized the funds, but, in October 1997, President Bill Clinton attempted to use the line-item veto to cancel the $39 million (~$ in ) allocated for the SR-71. In June 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the line-item veto was unconstitutional. All this left the SR-71&#x27;s status uncertain until September 1998, when the USAF called for the funds to be redistributed; the USAF permanently retired it in 1998.

NASA operated the two last airworthy Blackbirds until 1999. All other Blackbirds have been moved to museums except for the two SR-71s and a few D-21 drones retained by the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (later renamed the Armstrong Flight Research Center).

===Records===
The SR-71 was the world&#x27;s fastest and highest-flying air-breathing operational manned aircraft throughout its career and it still holds that record. On 28 July 1976, SR-71 serial number , piloted by then Captain Robert Helt, broke the world record: an &quot;absolute altitude record&quot; of . Several aircraft have exceeded this altitude in zoom climbs, but not in sustained flight. That same day SR-71 serial number set an absolute speed record of , approximately Mach 3.3. SR-71 pilot Brian Shul states in his book &quot;The Untouchables&quot; that he flew in excess of Mach 3.5 on 15 April 1986 over Libya to evade a missile.

The SR-71 also holds the &quot;speed over a recognized course&quot; record for flying from New York to London—distance , , and an elapsed time of 1 hour 54 minutes and 56.4 seconds—set on 1 September 1974, while flown by USAF pilot James V. Sullivan and Noel F. Widdifield, reconnaissance systems officer (RSO). This equates to an average speed of about Mach 2.72, including deceleration for in-flight refueling. Peak speeds during this flight were likely closer to the declassified top speed of over Mach 3.2. For comparison, the best commercial Concorde flight time was 2 hours 52 minutes and the Boeing 747 averages 6 hours 15 minutes.

On 26 April 1971, 61–7968, flown by majors Thomas B. Estes and Dewain C. Vick, flew over in 10 hours and 30 minutes. This flight was awarded the 1971 Mackay Trophy for the &quot;most meritorious flight of the year&quot; and the 1972 Harmon Trophy for &quot;most outstanding international achievement in the art/science of aeronautics&quot;.

When the SR-71 was retired in 1990, one Blackbird was flown from its birthplace at USAF Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, to go on exhibit at what is now the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia. On 6 March 1990, Lt. Col. Raymond E. and Lt. Col. Joseph T. Vida piloted SR-71 S/N on its final Senior Crown flight and set four new speed records in the process:
*Los Angeles, California, to Washington, D.C., distance , average speed , and an elapsed time of 64 minutes 20 seconds.
*West Coast to East Coast, distance , average speed , and an elapsed time of 67 minutes 54 seconds.
*Kansas City, Missouri, to Washington, D.C., distance , average speed , and an elapsed time of 25 minutes 59 seconds.
*St. Louis, Missouri, to Cincinnati, Ohio, distance , average speed , and an elapsed time of 8 minutes 32 seconds.

These four speed records were accepted by the National Aeronautic Association (NAA), the recognized body for aviation records in the United States. Additionally, &quot;Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian&quot; reported that the USAF clocked the SR-71 at one point in its flight reaching . After the Los Angeles–Washington flight, on 6 March 1990, Senator John Glenn addressed the United States Senate, chastising the Department of Defense for not using the SR-71 to its full potential:

===Successor===
Speculation existed regarding a replacement for the SR-71, including a rumored aircraft codenamed Aurora. The limitations of reconnaissance satellites, which take up to 24 hours to arrive in the proper orbit to photograph a particular target, make them slower to respond to demand than reconnaissance planes. The fly-over orbit of spy satellites may also be predicted and can allow assets to be hidden when the satellite passes, a drawback not shared by aircraft. Thus, there are doubts that the US has abandoned the concept of spy planes to complement reconnaissance satellites. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are also used for aerial reconnaissance in the 21st century, being able to overfly hostile territory without putting human pilots at risk, as well as being smaller and harder to detect than manned aircraft.

On 1 November 2013, media outlets reported that Skunk Works has been working on an unmanned reconnaissance airplane it has named SR-72, which would fly twice as fast as the SR-71, at Mach 6. However, the USAF is officially pursuing the Northrop Grumman RQ-180 UAV to assume the SR-71&#x27;s strategic ISR role.

==Variants==
* SR-71A was the main production variant.
* SR-71B was a trainer variant.
* SR-71C was a hybrid trainer aircraft composed of the rear fuselage of the first YF-12A (S/N ) and the forward fuselage from an SR-71 static test unit. The YF-12 had been wrecked in a 1966 landing accident. It has been reported that this Blackbird was seemingly not quite straight and had a yaw at supersonic speeds. However, this was caused by a mis-aligned pitot tube reporting a 4° yaw that was not actually present. It was soon corrected and then flew normally. It was nicknamed &quot;The Bastard&quot;.

==Accidents and aircraft disposition==

Twelve SR-71s were lost and one pilot died in accidents during the aircraft&#x27;s service career. Eleven of these accidents happened between 1966 and 1972.

Some secondary references use incorrect 64-series aircraft serial numbers (&quot;e.g.&quot; SR-71C )

After completion of all USAF and NASA SR-71 operations at Edwards AFB, the SR-71 Flight Simulator was moved in July 2006 to the Frontiers of Flight Museum at Love Field Airport in Dallas, Texas.

<text>Bruce Duncan &quot;Utah&quot; Phillips (May 15, 1935 – May 23, 2008) was an American labor organizer, folk singer, storyteller and poet. He described the struggles of labor unions and the power of direct action, self-identifying as an anarchist. He often promoted the Industrial Workers of the World in his music, actions, and words.

==Early years==
Phillips was born in Cleveland to Edwin Deroger Phillips and Frances Kathleen Coates. His father, Edwin Phillips, was a labor organizer, and his parents&#x27; activism influenced much of his life&#x27;s work. Phillips was a card-carrying member of the Industrial Workers of the World (Wobblies), which were headquartered in Chicago. His parents divorced and his mother remarried. Phillips was adopted at the age of five by his stepfather, Syd Cohen, who managed the Hippodrome Theater in Cleveland, one of the last vaudeville houses in the city. Cohen moved the family to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he managed the Lyric Theater, another vaudeville house. Phillips attributes his early exposure to vaudeville through his stepfather as being an important influence on his later career.

Phillips attended East High School in Salt Lake City, where he was involved in the arts and plays. He served in the United States Army for three years in the 1950s. Witnessing the devastation of post-war Korea greatly influenced his social and political thinking. After discharge from the army, Phillips rode the railroads, and wrote songs.

==Career==
While riding the rails and tramping around the west, Phillips returned to Salt Lake City, where he met Ammon Hennacy from the Catholic Worker Movement. He gave credit to Hennacy for saving him from a life of drifting to one dedicated to using his gifts and talents toward activism and public service. Phillips assisted him in establishing a mission house of hospitality named after the activist Joe Hill. Phillips worked at the Joe Hill House for the next eight years, then ran for the U.S. Senate as a candidate of Utah&#x27;s Peace and Freedom Party in 1968. He received 2,019 votes (0.5%) in an election won by Republican Wallace F. Bennett. He also ran for president of the United States in 1976 for the Do-Nothing Party.

He adopted the name U. Utah Phillips in keeping with the hobo tradition of adopting a moniker that included an initial and the state of origin, and in emulation of country vocalist T. Texas Tyler.

Phillips met folk singer Rosalie Sorrels in the early 1950s, and remained a close friend of hers. Sorrels started playing the songs that Phillips wrote, and through her his music began to spread. After leaving Utah in the late 1960s, he went to Saratoga Springs, New York, where he was befriended by the folk community at the Caffè Lena coffee house. He became a staple performer there for a decade, and would return throughout his career.

Phillips was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or Wobblies). His views of unions and politics were shaped by his parents, especially his mother who was a labor organizer for the CIO. But Phillips was more of a Christian anarchist and a pacifist, so found the modern-day Wobblies to be the perfect fit for him, an iconoclast and artist. In recent years, perhaps no single person did more to spread the Wobbly gospel than Phillips, whose countless concerts were, in effect, organizing meetings for the cause of labor, unions, anarchism, pacifism, and the Wobblies. He was a tremendous interpreter of classic Wobbly tunes including &quot;Hallelujah, I&#x27;m a Bum,&quot; &quot;The Preacher and the Slave,&quot; and &quot;Bread and Roses.&quot;

An avid trainhopper, Phillips recorded several albums of music related to the railroads, especially the era of steam locomotives. His 1973 album, &quot;Good Though!&quot;, is an example, and contains such songs as &quot;Daddy, What&#x27;s a Train?&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Rails&quot; as well as what may be his most famous composition, &quot;Moose Turd Pie&quot; wherein he tells a tall tale of his work as a gandy dancer repairing track in the Southwestern United States desert.

In 1991 Phillips recorded, in one take, an album of song, poetry and short stories entitled &quot;I&#x27;ve Got To Know&quot;, inspired by his anger at the first Gulf War. The album includes &quot;Enola Gay,&quot; his first composition written about the United States&#x27; atomic attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Phillips was a mentor to folk singer Kate Wolf. In 1998, he was the first recipient of the Kate Wolf Memorial Award from the World Folk Music Association. He recorded songs and stories with Rosalie Sorrels on a CD called &quot;The Long Memory&quot; (1996), originally a college project &quot;Worker&#x27;s Doxology&quot; for 1992 &#x27;cold-drill Magazine&#x27; Boise State University. His admirer, Ani DiFranco, recorded two CDs, &quot;The Past Didn&#x27;t Go Anywhere&quot; (1996) and &quot;Fellow Workers&quot; (1999), with him. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work with DiFranco. His &quot;Green Rolling Hills&quot; was made into a country hit by Emmylou Harris, and &quot;The Goodnight-Loving Trail&quot; became a classic as well, being recorded by Ian Tyson, Tom Waits, and others.

==Later years and death==
Though known primarily for his work as a concert performer and labor organizer, Phillips also worked as an archivist, dishwasher, and warehouse-man.

Phillips was a member of various socio-political organizations and groups throughout his life. A strong supporter of labor struggles, he was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (Mine Mill), and the Travelling Musician&#x27;s Union AFM Local 1000. In solidarity with the poor, he was also an honorary member of Dignity Village, a homeless community. A pacifist, he was a member of Veterans for Peace and the Peace Center of Nevada County.

In his personal life, Phillips enjoyed varied hobbies and interests. These included Egyptology; amateur chemistry; linguistics; history (Asian, African, Mormon and world); futhark; debate; and poetry. He also enjoyed culinary hobbies, such as pickling, cooking and gardening.

He married Joanna Robinson on July 31, 1989, in Nevada City.

Phillips became an elder statesman for the folk music community, and a keeper of stories and songs that might otherwise have passed into obscurity. He was also a member of the great Traveling Nation, the community of hobos and railroad bums that populates the Midwest United States along the rail lines, and was an important keeper of their history and culture. He also became an honorary member of numerous folk societies in the US and Canada.

When Kate Wolf grew ill and was forced to cancel concerts, she asked Phillips to fill in. Suffering from an ailment which makes it more difficult to play guitar, Phillips hesitated, citing his declining guitar ability. &quot;Nobody ever came just to hear you play,&quot; she said. Phillips told this story as a way of explaining how his style over the years became increasingly based on storytelling instead of just songs. He was a gifted storyteller and monologist, and his concerts generally had an even mix of spoken word and sung content. He attributed much of his success to his personality. &quot;It is better to be likeable than talented,&quot; he often said, self-deprecatingly.

From 1997 to 2001, Phillips hosted his own weekly radio show, &quot;Loafer&#x27;s Glory: The Hobo Jungle of the Mind,&quot; originating on KVMR and nationally syndicated. The show was suspended after 100 episodes due to lack of funding.

Phillips lived in Nevada City, California, for 21 years where he worked on the start-up of the Hospitality House, a homeless shelter, and the Peace and Justice Center. &quot;It&#x27;s my town. Nevada City is a primary seed-bed for community organizing.&quot;

In August 2007, Phillips announced that he would undergo catheter ablation to address his heart problems. Later that autumn, Phillips announced that due to health problems he could no longer tour. By January 2008, he decided against a heart transplant.

Phillips died May 23, 2008, in Nevada City, California, from complications of heart disease, eight days after his 73rd birthday, and is buried in Forest View Cemetery in Nevada City.

<text>Kalamazoo College is a private liberal arts college in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Founded in 1833 by Baptist ministers as the Michigan and Huron Institute, Kalamazoo is the oldest private college in Michigan. From 1840 to 1850, the institute operated as the Kalamazoo Branch of the University of Michigan. After receiving its charter from the state in 1855, the institute changed its name to Kalamazoo College.

Kalamazoo is a member of the Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges (CLAC) and the Great Lakes Colleges Association. The college&#x27;s sports teams are nicknamed the Hornets and compete in the NCAA Division III Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association.

==History==

Kalamazoo College was founded in 1833 by a group of Baptist ministers as the Michigan and Huron Institute. Its charter was granted on April 22, 1833, the first school chartered by the Legislative Council of the Territory of Michigan. Instruction at the Institute began in fall 1836. In 1837, the name of the fledgling college was changed to the Kalamazoo Literary Institute and school officials made their first attempt to secure recognition as a college from the state of Michigan. In 1838, however, the University of Michigan opened the Kalamazoo Branch of the University of Michigan, providing a local competitor to the Literary Institute. In 1840, the two schools merged, and from 1840 to 1850, the college operated as the Kalamazoo Branch of the University of Michigan. In 1850, the Kalamazoo Literary Institute name was restored and in 1855 the school finally received an educational charter from the State of Michigan; it was now officially a college. The school changed its name to Kalamazoo College.

James Stone, the first president of Kalamazoo College, led the school from 1842 through 1863 and was responsible for instituting the high academic standards that allowed the college to receive its charter. Shortly after becoming president, Stone proposed the addition of a theological seminary to increase the supply of ministers in the region. With the support of the Baptist church, classes at the Kalamazoo Theological Seminary began in 1848 with 11 students. At the same time, the Female Department continued to expand under the watchful eye of Lucinda Hinsdale Stone. In 1845–46, almost half of the 90 students enrolled in Kalamazoo were women.
The first known student of African descent to attend Kalamazoo College was ex-slave Rufus Lewis Perry. Perry attended Kalamazoo Theological Seminary from 1860 to 1861, but left before he received a diploma. He was ordained a Baptist minister in Ann Arbor in 1861, and later earned a Ph.D. from State University in Louisville, Kentucky. Jamaican-born brothers Solomon and John Williamson were the first black graduates from &quot;K,&quot; receiving their diplomas in 1911. Kalamazoo College also served as a pioneer in coed education, granting its first degree to a woman, Catherine V. Eldred, in 1870.

In 1877, Kalamazoo College students published the first edition of &quot;The Index&quot;, a student-run newspaper that continues to publish today. The college also publishes &quot;The Cauldron&quot;, an annual literary-arts journal, and &quot;The Passage&quot;, an annual compilation of students&#x27; work from study abroad.

Kalamazoo College&#x27;s reputation was built during the presidency of Weimer Hicks, who served from 1954 to 1971. Hicks conceived of the &quot;K Plan&quot; program under which most Kalamazoo students spend at least one term abroad and spend at least one term working in an academic internship.

On January 3, 2006, Kalamazoo College opened the new Upjohn Library Commons which includes the completely renovated skeleton of the older library, and an extension which adds to its volume capacity.

A marker designating the college as a Michigan Historic Site was erected in 1983 by the Michigan History Division, Department of State. The inscription reads:

The first classroom building for the Michigan and Huron Institute, now Kalamazoo College, was erected on this site between June and September of 1836. The charter bill for the school had been introduced in the Michigan Territorial Legislative Council on January 18, 1833, and signed into law by Governor George B. Porter on April 22, 1833. Village pledges supplied funds for the two-story frame classroom structure, which was the start of Michigan’s first church-related college.
==Academics==

=== Admissions ===

Kalamazoo is considered &quot;more selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For the Class of 2024 (enrolled fall 2020), Kalamazoo received 3,456 applications and accepted 2,569 (74.3%). Of those accepted, 384 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 14.9%. Kalamazoo&#x27;s freshman retention rate is 83%, with 79% going on to graduate within six years.

Of the 44% of enrolled freshmen in 2020 who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1150–1360. Of the 20% of the incoming freshman class who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 25 and 30.

The college sponsored 2 Merit Scholarship awards in 2020. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 2 first-year students were National Merit Scholars.


===Academic distinctions===

Kalamazoo offers 30 majors spread across the fields of Fine Arts, Humanities, Modern and Classical Languages and Literature, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and Social Sciences. Additionally, the college offers 22 minors, 5 special programs, and 13 concentrations. It is listed in Loren Pope&#x27;s &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot;.

::Biology/Biological Sciences (70)
::Business/Commerce (55)
::Chemistry (44)
::Psychology (36)
::Social Sciences (27)
::English Language &amp; Literature (24)

A 2017 study by Higher Education Data Sharing lists Kalamazoo College in the top 2 percent of four-year liberal arts colleges in the United States whose graduates go on to earn a Ph.D. According to this study, Kalamazoo College is ranked number seventeen among all private liberal arts colleges and — when compared with all academic institutions — it ranks number thirty-three in Ph.D.s per capita. Among all undergraduate institutions, Kalamazoo College was first per capita in 2005 for recruitment of Peace Corps volunteers.

96 percent of full-time faculty hold a Ph.D. or the terminal degree in their field.

===The K Plan===
Kalamazoo College emphasizes the importance of experiential education. The academic plan — known as the &quot;K plan&quot; — consists of a rigorous liberal arts education supplemented by experience abroad and in the Kalamazoo community.

Students at Kalamazoo College must fulfill specific degree requirements in order to graduate, as well as completion of three Shared Passages Seminars during the first, sophomore, and senior years at Kalamazoo. First-year seminars focus on developing writing and communication skills, sophomore seminars emphasize international culture and experience in preparation for study abroad, and senior seminars focus on major specific or interdisciplinary topics to cap a student&#x27;s education experience. Upon graduation, students must demonstrate a proficiency in a second language at an intermediate level, satisfy a quantitative reasoning requirement, and complete a senior individualized project which may take the form of a thesis, an artistic performance, or any other work-intensive project of a student&#x27;s choosing. These experiences are supplemented by one or more terms abroad, service-learning projects during school terms, and internship opportunities during the summer.

===Service-learning===
Kalamazoo College initiated the service-learning program in 1997. In 2001, Trustee Ronda Stryker dedicated to her grandmother the Mary Jane Underwood Stryker Institute for Service learning. This Institute was created to house several service-Learning programs in the school. The current director of the Mary Jane Underwood Stryker Institute is Alison Geist. In 2008, Kalamazoo College had twenty-three on-going service-learning programs. Several courses in the college incorporate service-learning into their curricula. Programs in service-learning include Community Advocates for Parents and Students, Helping Youth through Personal Empowerment, Academic Mentorship In Giants On-going Success, the Woodward School, Keeping the Doors Open, and Farms to K.

===Study abroad===
About 70% of Kalamazoo College students spend at least one term abroad and the college maintains partnerships with over 45 programs and 22 countries on six continents. Students at Kalamazoo College typically study abroad during their third (junior) Year, and each academic department designs its requirements in a way that assumes majors will study abroad for all or part of junior year though some students may choose to do a short-term study abroad during their second (sophomore) or fourth (senior) year.

===Center for Career and Professional Development===
In 2009, the Center Career Development merged with the Guilds of Kalamazoo College to create the Center for Career and Professional Development. Opportunities through the CCPD include the Discovery Externship Program and the Field Experience Program

==Athletics==
The college&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Hornets. They compete in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III and the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA). , the Hornet men&#x27;s tennis squad has won its conference&#x27;s championship 78 consecutive years.

The school&#x27;s first win came two years later in 1894 with a 16–4 victory over the Kalamazoo YMCA. It was 1895 before the school defeated another college football team, with a 12–8 victory over the Alma Scots.

In 1897, the first coach came to the program with Charles Hall, who led the team to a record of 7 wins and 1 loss, earning the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship. The current coach is Jamie Zorbo.

===Men&#x27;s tennis===
The Kalamazoo College men&#x27;s tennis team has won 78 consecutive Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association championships (1936–2013) with a record of 426–3 in the MIAA from 1935 - 2007. Kalamazoo has won seven NCAA Division III national championships and has made 25 consecutive NCAA III tournament appearances.

===Men&#x27;s swimming and diving===
Men&#x27;s swimming and diving at Kalamazoo has an impressive history. The team is known for producing individual national champions in the pool and on the boards, and also for maintaining a national presence with regular appearances as a top-10 team at the NCAA Division III national championships. Their highest finish was 4th in 2010. The swimming and diving team is the second most successful athletic program at Kalamazoo, after the men&#x27;s tennis team, and it is also one of the top 10 most successful teams in the MIAA, with 27 championships.

===Women&#x27;s cross country===
Allison Iott finished 10th in the 2008 NCAA D-3 Championship, earning USTFCCCA All-American honors in cross country. She was Kalamazoo&#x27;s first-ever women&#x27;s cross country MIAA conference meet champion and MIAA Conference MVP.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

====Basketball dispute====
In 2001, the men&#x27;s basketball team was at the center of a lengthy dispute regarding the outcome of a January 20 game with league rival the Olivet Comets. With Olivet leading 70–69, Kalamazoo center, Kevin Baird, made a shot at the buzzer that was initially waved off by referees. The referees reviewed videotape of the game and determined that the player had, in fact, released his shot before the buzzer; they then awarded Kalamazoo a 71–70 victory. After the game, Olivet filed a protest with the conference commissioner, claiming that officials had misapplied the way in which videotape may be used. On January 23, the conference upheld the protest and awarded Olivet the victory. Kalamazoo then filed a protest with the NCAA, claiming that Olivet&#x27;s protest was in violation of NCAA bylaws. On February 1, the NCAA upheld Kalamazoo&#x27;s counter-protest and again awarded the game to the Hornets. The dispute between Olivet and Kalamazoo received national attention and the shot was shown repeatedly on ESPN.

===Women&#x27;s lacrosse===
In the 2013–14 academic year, women&#x27;s lacrosse became a varsity sport at Kalamazoo. It is the college&#x27;s first new varsity athletic program since 1991. Women&#x27;s lacrosse previously existed as one of Kalamazoo&#x27;s student-run club sports. In Spring 2012, the school announced the new program, as well as the hiring of Emilia Ward for the position of head coach. Ward previously coached at Winthrop University, and Adrian College, after lettering four years in women&#x27;s lacrosse at Manhattan College.

===Fight song===
The words to the college fight-song, &quot;All Hail to Kazoo,&quot; were written by A. G. Walton (1911) with music by D. R. Belcher (1909), arranged by Burton Edward Fischer.

==Student life and traditions==

Student organizations are one of the main sources of entertainment for the student body. They routinely bring in speakers as well as stage performances, dances, and movie showings.

During the fall quarter, there are two main events: K Fest and the Homecoming dance. At K Fest, student organizations provide activities for the students, such as pumpkin carving and bobbing for apples.

During the winter quarter, the college holds the annual Monte Carlo night, on which the student body raises money by gambling in a makeshift casino where the professors are the dealers. They play for scrip redeemable for prizes.

===Pride Ball (formerly Crystal Ball)===
Kaleidoscope (formerly known as the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Ally Student Organization, GLBTSO) hosted the Crystal Ball each spring. Crystal Ball was a college-sponsored dance in which attendees would dress in drag or unusual costumes. A long-standing tradition at Kalamazoo, this event was created to educate the campus about GLBT issues and celebrate the persons who make up the GLBT community. In Spring of 2016 the Crystal Ball was renamed Pride Ball. The tradition continues in most other aspects; it is still hosted by the same club and attendees are still encouraged to don attire that thoughtfully represents or challenges their gender identity. This popular event features live music, dancing, and contests.

===The Quad===
The campus is built around a grassy hill known as &quot;The Quad.&quot; The Quad is also the site of numerous large-scale events throughout the year, including Homecoming, Spring Fling, Convocation, and Commencement. At the top of the hill sits Stetson Chapel, a favorite location for alumni wedding services. The bell tower holds the only peal of change ringing bells in Michigan. They were all cast in 1983 at Whitechapel.

The Quad is home to another popular Kalamazoo College student tradition, &quot;streaking the Quad,&quot; a noisy, late-night descent in the nude from the chapel, down the hill, and back to the top again. Tradition dictates that students must touch the school sign before returning to the top. There is a mass streak after the spring performance by Frelon, the Kalamazoo College dance group, and also during the day by the senior class. This often coincides with a wedding.

===Day of Gracious Living===
Since 1974, the college has upheld a springtime tradition of canceling all classes for a &quot;Day of Gracious Living&quot; (DOGL). While it was originally instituted (despite the Student Commission&#x27;s rejection) as a day for students to relax and have fun, the 1980 Kalamazoo tornado prompted students to spend that year&#x27;s DOGL helping clean up after the storm and giving back to their community. Many students enjoy the day at the North Beach in South Haven, Michigan. The date is determined by the president of the Student Commission and kept secret from the student body, though it is usually on a Wednesday during weeks 7–9. On the morning of the Day of Gracious Living, the bells of Stetson Chapel ring, announcing the day to the student body.

===Recycling program===
Kalamazoo College has become a leading institution in the area of recycling and environmental awareness. A crew of student workers operates one of the nation&#x27;s most successful recycling programs and organizes the school&#x27;s participation in the annual RecycleMania event, a competition among over 400 colleges and universities across the United States. In 2005, Kalamazoo College came to national prominence with a 3rd-place finish in the Grand Champion category. While annually placing in the top five in a variety of categories, in 2008 Kalamazoo College placed first in both the Grand Champion and Stephen K. Gaski Per Capita Classic competitions.

===Sustainability===
Kalamazoo College signed the President&#x27;s Climate Commitment in 2007 and has completed a greenhouse gas emission inventory. The college&#x27;s Hicks Student Center is partially powered by wind and solar energy, and the student group D.I.R.T. (Digging in Renewable Turf) maintains an organic garden on campus. The spring 2009 Energy Sting competition encouraged students to reduce their energy consumption. Kalamazoo received a B on the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card.

===Beginning Band Methods===
One of Kalamazoo&#x27;s most popular courses is &quot;Beginning Band Methods&quot;, with over 100 students enrolling annually. Open to all students, including those with no musical experience, the courses train them to play brass and woodwind instruments. At the end of the term, the students perform a public concert.

==Presidents of Kalamazoo College==

In January 2016, Jorge Gonzalez was announced as Kalamazoo College&#x27;s 18th president. He was scheduled to take office on July 1, 2016, and has declared that he will host multiple new interdisciplinary programmes, such as Latin American studies and public health.

In 2005, Eileen Wilson-Oyelaran became Kalamazoo College&#x27;s 17th president and first female president, as well as the first African-American president of the school. She is the 22nd president overall, including interim and acting presidents. Her immediate predecessors are Bernard Palchick, who served as interim president and returned to the administration; and James F. Jones, who departed to become president of Trinity College in Connecticut.

<doc id="55249" wikidata="Q11083177" url="?curid=55249" title="Skunk Works">
<text>Skunk Works is an official pseudonym for Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Advanced Development Programs (ADP), formerly called Lockheed Advanced Development Projects. It is responsible for a number of aircraft designs, highly classified research and development programs, and exotic aircraft platforms. Known locations include United States Air Force Plant 42 (Palmdale, California), United States Air Force Plant 4 (Fort Worth, Texas), and Marietta, Georgia.

Skunk Works&#x27; history started with the P-38 Lightning in 1939 and the P-80 Shooting Star in 1943. Skunk Works engineers subsequently developed the U-2, SR-71 Blackbird, F-117 Nighthawk, F-22 Raptor, and F-35 Lightning II, the latter being used in the air forces of several countries. 

The Skunk Works name was taken from the &quot;Skonk Oil&quot; factory in the comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. Derived from the Lockheed use of the term, the designation &quot;skunk works&quot; or &quot;skunkworks&quot; is now widely used in business, engineering, and technical fields to describe a group within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampered by bureaucracy, with the task of working on advanced or secret projects.

==History==
There are conflicting observations about the birth of Skunk Works.

Engineer Ben Rich sets the origin as June 1943 in Burbank, California. Kelly Johnson has made contradictory statements, some agreeing with Rich, and others putting the origin earlier, in 1939. The official Lockheed Skunk Works story states:

Warren M. Bodie, journalist, historian, and Skunk Works engineer from 1977 to 1984, wrote that engineering independence, elitism and secrecy of the Skunk Works variety were demonstrated earlier when Lockheed was asked by Lieutenant Benjamin S. Kelsey (later air force brigadier general) to build for the United States Army Air Corps a high speed, high altitude fighter to compete with German aircraft. In July 1938, while the rest of Lockheed was busy tooling up to build Hudson reconnaissance bombers to fill a British contract, a small group of engineers was assigned to fabricate the first prototype of what would become the P-38 Lightning. Kelly Johnson set them apart from the rest of the factory in a walled-off section of one building, off limits to all but those involved directly. Secretly, a number of advanced features were being incorporated into the new fighter including a significant structural revolution in which the aluminum skin of the aircraft was joggled, fitted and flush-riveted, a design innovation not called for in the army&#x27;s specification but one that would yield less aerodynamic drag and give greater strength with lower mass. 

As a result, the XP-38 was the first 400-mph fighter in the world. The Lightning team was temporarily moved to the 3G Distillery, a smelly former bourbon works where the first YP-38 (constructor&#x27;s number 2202) was built. Moving from the distillery to a larger building, the stench from a nearby plastic factory was so vile that Irv Culver, one of the engineers, began answering the intra-Lockheed &quot;house&quot; phone &quot;Skonk Works, inside man Culver speaking!&quot; 

In Al Capp&#x27;s comic strip Li&#x27;l Abner, Big Barnsmell&#x27;s Skonk Works — spelled with an &quot;o&quot; — was where Kickapoo Joy Juice was brewed from skunks, old shoes, kerosene, anvils, and other strange ingredients. When the name leaked out, Lockheed ordered it changed to &quot;Skunk Works&quot; to avoid potential legal trouble over use of a copyrighted term. The term rapidly circulated throughout the aerospace community, and became a common nickname for research and development offices. The once informal nickname is now a registered trademark of Lockheed Martin. 

In November 1941, Kelsey gave the unofficial nod to Johnson and the P-38 team to engineer a drop tank system to extend range for the fighter, and they completed the initial research and development without a contract. When the Army Air Forces officially asked for a range extension solution it was ready. The range modifications were performed in Lockheed&#x27;s Building 304, starting with 100 P-38F models on April 15, 1942. Some of the group of independent-minded engineers were later involved with the XP-80 project, the prototype of the P-80 Shooting Star. 

Mary G. Ross, the first Native American female engineer, began working at Lockheed in 1942 on the mathematics of compressibility in high-speed flight—a problem first seriously encountered in the P-38. In 1952, she was invited to join the Skunk Works team.

===1950s to 1990s===
In 1955, the Skunk Works received a contract from the CIA to build a spyplane known as the U-2 with the intention of flying over the Soviet Union and photographing sites of strategic interest. The U-2 was tested at Groom Lake in the Nevada desert, and the Flight Test Engineer in charge was Joseph F. Ware, Jr. The first overflight took place on July 4 1956. The U-2 ceased overflights when Francis Gary Powers was shot down during a mission on May 1, 1960, while over Russia.

The Skunk Works had predicted that the U-2 would have a limited operational life over the Soviet Union. The CIA agreed. In late 1959, Skunk Works received a contract to build five A-12 aircraft at a cost of $96 million. Building a Mach 3.0+ aircraft out of titanium posed enormous difficulties, and the first flight did not occur until 1962. (Titanium supply was largely dominated by the Soviet Union, so the CIA used several shell corporations to acquire source material.) Several years later, the U.S. Air Force became interested in the design, and it ordered the SR-71 Blackbird, a two-seater version of the A-12. This aircraft first flew in 1966 and remained in service until 1998.

The D-21 drone, similar in design to the Blackbird, was built to overfly the Lop Nur nuclear test facility in China. This drone was launched from the back of a specially modified A-12, known as M-21, of which there were two built. After a fatal mid-air collision on the fourth launch, the drones were re-built as D-21Bs, and launched with a rocket booster from B-52s. Four operational missions were conducted over China, but the camera packages were never successfully recovered. Kelly Johnson headed the Skunk Works until 1975. He was succeeded by Ben Rich.

In 1976, the Skunk Works began production on a pair of stealth technology demonstrators for the U.S. Air Force named &quot;Have Blue&quot; in Building 82 at Burbank. These scaled-down demonstrators, built in only 18 months, were a revolutionary step forward in aviation technology because of their extremely small radar cross-section. After a series of successful test flights beginning in 1977, the Air force awarded Skunk Works the contract to build the F-117 stealth fighter on November 1, 1978.

During the entirety of the Cold War, the Skunk Works was located in Burbank, California, on the eastern side of Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (). After 1989, Lockheed reorganized its operations and relocated the Skunk Works to Site 10 at U.S. Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, where it remains in operation today. Most of the old Skunk Works buildings in Burbank were demolished in the late 1990s to make room for parking lots. One main building still remains at 2777 Ontario Street in Burbank (near San Fernando Road), now used as an office building for digital film post-production and sound mixing. During the late 1990s when designing Pixar&#x27;s building, Edwin Catmull and Steve Jobs visited a Skunkworks Building which influenced Jobs&#x27; design. In 2009, the Skunk Works was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

==Term origin==
The term &quot;Skunk Works&quot; came from Al Capp&#x27;s satirical, hillbilly comic strip &quot;Li’l Abner&quot;, which was immensely popular from 1935 through the 1950s. In the comic, the “Skonk Works&quot; was a dilapidated factory located on the remote outskirts of Dogpatch, in the backwoods of Kentucky. According to the strip, scores of locals were done in yearly by the toxic fumes of the concentrated &quot;skonk oil&quot;, which was brewed and barreled daily by &quot;Big Barnsmell&quot; (known as the lonely &quot;inside man&quot; at the Skonk Works), by grinding dead skunks and worn shoes into a smoldering still, for some mysterious, unspecified purpose.

In mid-1939 when Lockheed was expanding rapidly, the YP-38 project was moved a few blocks away to the newly purchased 3G Distillery, also known as Three G or GGG Distillery. Lockheed took over the building but the sour smell of bourbon mash lingered, partly because the group of buildings continued to store barrels of aging whiskey. The first YP-38 was built there before the team moved back to Lockheed&#x27;s main factory a year later. In 1964, Johnson told &quot;Look&quot; magazine that the bourbon distillery was the first of five Lockheed skunk works locations.

During the development of the P-80 Shooting Star, Johnson&#x27;s engineering team was located adjacent to a plastics factory. According to Ben Rich’s memoir, an engineer jokingly showed up to work one day wearing a Civil Defense gas mask. To comment on the smell and the secrecy the project entailed, another engineer, Irv Culver, referred to the facility as &quot;Skonk Works&quot;. As the development was very secret, the employees were told to be careful even with how they answered phone calls. One day, when the Department of the Navy was trying to reach the Lockheed management for the P-80 project, the call was accidentally transferred to Culver’s desk. Culver answered the phone in his trademark fashion of the time, by picking up the phone and stating &quot;Skonk Works, inside man Culver&quot;. &quot;What?&quot; replied the voice at the other end. &quot;Skonk Works&quot;, Culver repeated. The name stuck. Culver later said at an interview conducted in 1993 that &quot;when Kelly Johnson heard about the incident, he promptly fired me. It didn’t really matter, since he was firing me about twice a day anyways.&quot;

At the request of the comic strip copyright holders, Lockheed changed the name of the advanced development company to &quot;Skunk Works&quot; in the 1960s. The name &quot;Skunk Works&quot; and the skunk design are now registered trademarks of the Lockheed Martin Corporation. The company also holds several registrations of it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. They have filed several challenges against registrants of domain names containing variations on the term under anti-cybersquatting policies, and have lost a case under the .uk domain name dispute resolution service against a company selling cannabis seeds and paraphernalia, which used the word &quot;skunkworks&quot; in its domain name (referring to &quot;Skunk&quot;, the pungent smell of the cannabis flower). Lockheed Martin claimed the company registered the domain in order to disrupt its business and that consumer confusion might result. The respondent company argued that Lockheed &quot;used its size, resources and financial position to employ &#x27;bullyboy&#x27; tactics against... a very small company.&quot;

In Australia, the trademark for use of the name &quot;Skunkworks&quot; is held by Perth-based television accessory manufacturer The Novita Group Pty Ltd. Lockheed Martin formally registered opposition to the application in 2006, however the Australian government&#x27;s intellectual property authority, IP Australia, rejected the opposition, awarding Novita the trademark in 2008.

<doc id="55251" wikidata="Q1421" url="?curid=55251" title="Titus">
<text>Titus Caesar Vespasianus ( ; 30 December 39 – 13 September AD 81) was Roman emperor from 79 to 81. A member of the Flavian dynasty, Titus succeeded his father Vespasian upon his death, becoming the first Roman emperor ever to succeed his biological father.

Before becoming emperor, Titus gained renown as a military commander, serving under his father in Judea during the First Jewish–Roman War. The campaign came to a brief halt with the death of emperor Nero in 68, launching Vespasian&#x27;s bid for the imperial power during the Year of the Four Emperors. When Vespasian was declared Emperor on 1 July 69, Titus was left in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion. In 70, he besieged and captured Jerusalem, and destroyed the city and the Second Temple. For this achievement Titus was awarded a triumph; the Arch of Titus commemorates his victory and still stands today.

During his father&#x27;s rule, Titus gained notoriety in Rome serving as prefect of the Praetorian Guard, and for carrying on a controversial relationship with the Jewish queen Berenice. Despite concerns over his character, Titus ruled to great acclaim following the death of Vespasian on 23 June 79, and was considered a good emperor by Suetonius and other contemporary historians.

As emperor, Titus is best known for completing the Colosseum and for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 and a fire in Rome in 80. After barely two years in office, Titus died of a fever on 13 September 81. He was deified by the Roman Senate and succeeded by his younger brother Domitian.

==Early life==
Titus was born in Rome, probably on 30 December 39 AD, as the eldest son of Titus Flavius Vespasianus, commonly known as Vespasian, and Domitilla the Elder. He had one younger sister, Domitilla the Younger (born 45), and one younger brother, Titus Flavius Domitianus (born 51), commonly referred to as Domitian.

=== Family background ===

Decades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome, which was gradually replaced in prominence by a new Italian nobility during the early 1st century. One such family was the &quot;gens Flavia&quot;, which rose from relative obscurity to prominence in only four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Titus&#x27;s great-grandfather, Titus Flavius Petro, had served as a centurion under Pompey during Caesar&#x27;s Civil War. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC.

Nevertheless, Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely-wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro&#x27;s son Titus Flavius Sabinus I, Titus&#x27;s grandfather. Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible equestrian status through his services as tax collector in Asia and banker in Helvetia. By marrying Vespasia Polla, he allied himself to the more prestigious patrician &quot;gens Vespasia&quot;, ensuring the elevation of his sons Titus Flavius Sabinus II and Vespasian to the senatorial rank.

The political career of Vespasian included the offices of quaestor, aedile and praetor and culminated with a consulship in 51, the year Domitian was born. As a military commander, he gained early renown by participating in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43. What little is known of Titus&#x27;s early life has been handed down by Suetonius, who recorded that he was brought up at the imperial court in the company of Britannicus, the son of Emperor Claudius, who would be murdered by Nero in 55.

The story was even told that Titus was reclining next to Britannicus on the night he was murdered and sipped of the poison that was handed to him. Further details on his education are scarce, but it seems he showed early promise in the military arts and was a skilled poet and orator both in Greek and Latin.

==Adult life==

From around 57 to 59 he was a military tribune in Germania. He also served in Britannia and perhaps arrived about 60 with reinforcements needed after the revolt of Boudica. About 63, he returned to Rome and married Arrecina Tertulla, daughter of Marcus Arrecinus Clemens, a former Prefect of the Praetorian Guard. She died about 65.

Titus then took a new wife of a much more distinguished family, Marcia Furnilla. However, Marcia&#x27;s family was closely linked to the opposition to Nero. Her uncle Barea Soranus and his daughter Servilia were among those who perished after the failed Pisonian conspiracy of 65. Some modern historians think that Titus divorced his wife because of her family&#x27;s connection to the conspiracy.

Titus never remarried and appears to have had daughters, at least one of them by Marcia Furnilla. The only one known to have survived to adulthood was Julia Flavia, perhaps Titus&#x27;s child by Arrecina, whose mother was also named Julia. During this period Titus also practiced law and attained the rank of quaestor.

===Judaean campaigns===

In 66, the Jews of the Judaea Province revolted against the Roman Empire. Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, was defeated at the battle of Beth-Horon and forced to retreat from Jerusalem. The pro-Roman King Agrippa II and his sister Berenice fled the city to Galilee, where they later gave themselves up to the Romans.

Nero appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion, who was dispatched to the region at once with the Fifth Legion and Tenth Legion. He was later joined at Ptolemais by Titus with the Fifteenth Legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans prepared to sweep across Galilee and march on Jerusalem.

The history of the war was covered in detail by the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus in his work &quot;The War of the Jews&quot;. Josephus served as a commander in the city of Yodfat when the Roman army invaded Galilee in 67. After an exhausting siege which lasted 47 days, the city fell, with an estimated 40,000 killed. Titus, however, was not simply set on ending the war.

Surviving one of several group suicides, Josephus surrendered to Vespasian and became a prisoner. He later wrote that he had provided the Romans with intelligence on the ongoing revolt. By 68, the entire coast and the north of Judaea were subjugated by the Roman Army, with decisive victories won at Taricheae and Gamala, where Titus distinguished himself as a skilled general.

====Year of the Four Emperors====
The last and most significant fortified city held by the Jewish resistance was Jerusalem. The campaign came to a sudden halt when news arrived of Nero&#x27;s death. Almost simultaneously, the Roman Senate had declared Galba, the governor of Hispania, as emperor. Vespasian decided to await further orders and sent Titus to greet the new &quot;princeps&quot;.

Before reaching Italy, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of Lusitania, and that Vitellius and his armies in Germania were preparing to march on the capital, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other, he abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea. Meanwhile, Otho was defeated in the First Battle of Bedriacum and committed suicide.

When the news reached the armies in Judaea and Ægyptus, they took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69. Vespasian accepted and, after negotiations by Titus, joined forces with Gaius Licinius Mucianus, governor of Syria. A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, and Vespasian travelled to Alexandria, leaving Titus in charge to end the Jewish rebellion. By the end of 69, the forces of Vitellius had been beaten, and Vespasian was officially declared emperor by the Senate on 21 December, thus ending the Year of the Four Emperors.

====Siege of Jerusalem====


Meanwhile, the Jews had become embroiled in a civil war of their own by splitting the resistance in Jerusalem among several factions. The Sicarii, led by Menahem ben Judah, could hold on for long; the Zealots, led by Eleazar ben Simon, eventually fell under the command of the Galilean leader John of Gush Halav; and the other northern rebel commander, Simon Bar Giora, managed to gain leadership over the Idumeans. Titus besieged Jerusalem. The Roman Army was joined by the Twelfth Legion, which had been previously defeated under Cestius Gallus, and from Alexandria, Vespasian sent Tiberius Julius Alexander, governor of Egypt, to act as Titus&#x27; second in command.

Titus surrounded the city with three legions (Vth, XIIth and XVth) on the western side and one (Xth) on the Mount of Olives to the east. He put pressure on the food and water supplies of the inhabitants by allowing pilgrims to enter the city to celebrate Passover and then refusing them egress. Jewish raids continuously harassed the Roman Army, one of which nearly resulted in Titus being captured.

After attempts by Josephus to negotiate a surrender had failed, the Romans resumed hostilities and quickly breached the first and second walls of the city. To intimidate the resistance, Titus ordered deserters from the Jewish side to be crucified around the city wall. By that time the Jews had been exhausted by famine, and when the weak third wall was breached, bitter street fighting ensued.

The Romans finally captured the Antonia Fortress and began a frontal assault on the gates of the Second Temple. As they breached the gate, the Romans set the upper and lower city aflame, culminating with the destruction of the Temple. When the fires subsided, Titus gave the order to destroy the remainder of the city, allegedly intending that no one would remember the name Jerusalem. The Temple was demolished, Titus&#x27;s soldiers proclaimed him &quot;imperator&quot; in honour of the victory.

Jerusalem was sacked and much of the population killed or dispersed. Josephus claims that 1,100,000 people were killed during the siege, most of whom were Jewish. Josephus&#x27;s death toll assumptions are rejected as impossible by modern scholarship since about a million people then lived in the Land of Israel, half of them Jewish, and sizable Jewish populations remained in the area after the war was over, even in the hard-hit region of Judea. However, 97,000 were captured and enslaved, including Simon Bar-Giora and John of Gischala. Many fled to areas around the Mediterranean Sea. Titus reportedly refused to accept a wreath of victory, as he claimed that he had not won the victory on his own but had been the vehicle through which their God had manifested his wrath against his people.

The Jewish diaspora during the Temple&#x27;s destruction, according to Josephus, was in Parthia (Persia), Babylonia (Iraq), and Arabia, and some were beyond the Euphrates and in Adiabene (Kurdistan).

===Heir to Vespasian===
Unable to sail to Italy during the winter, Titus celebrated elaborate games at Caesarea Maritima and Berytus and then travelled to Zeugma on the Euphrates, where he was presented with a crown by Vologases I of Parthia. While he was visiting Antioch, he confirmed the traditional rights of the Jews in that city.

On his way to Alexandria, he stopped in Memphis to consecrate the sacred bull Apis. According to Suetonius, that caused consternation since the ceremony required Titus to wear a diadem, which the Romans associated with monarchy, and the partisanship of Titus&#x27;s legions had already led to fears that he might rebel against his father. Titus returned quickly to Rome in the hope, according to Suetonius, of allaying any suspicions about his conduct.

Upon his arrival in Rome in 71, Titus was awarded a triumph. Accompanied by Vespasian and Domitian, Titus rode into the city, enthusiastically saluted by the Roman populace and preceded by a lavish parade containing treasures and captives from the war. Josephus describes a procession with large amounts of gold and silver carried along the route, followed by elaborate re-enactments of the war, Jewish prisoners and finally the treasures taken from the Temple of Jerusalem, including the Menorah and the Pentateuch. Simon Bar Giora was executed in the Forum, and the procession closed with religious sacrifices at the Temple of Jupiter.
The triumphal Arch of Titus, which stands at one entrance to the Forum, memorialises the victory of Titus.

With Vespasian declared emperor, Titus and his brother Domitian received the title of &quot;Caesar&quot; from the Senate. In addition to sharing tribunician power with his father, Titus held seven consulships during Vespasian&#x27;s reign and acted as his secretary, appearing in the Senate on his behalf. More crucially, he was appointed Praetorian prefect (commander of the Praetorian Guard), ensuring its loyalty to the emperor and further solidifying Vespasian&#x27;s position as a legitimate ruler.

In that capacity, Titus achieved considerable notoriety in Rome for his violent actions, frequently ordering the execution of suspected traitors on the spot. When in 79, a plot by Aulus Caecina Alienus and Eprius Marcellus to overthrow Vespasian was uncovered, Titus invited Alienus to dinner and ordered him to be stabbed before he had even left the room.

During the Jewish Wars, Titus had begun a love affair with Berenice, the sister of Agrippa II. The Herodians had collaborated with the Romans during the rebellion, and Berenice herself had supported Vespasian in his campaign to become emperor. In 75, she returned to Titus and openly lived with him in the palace as his promised wife. The Romans were wary of the eastern queen and disapproved of their relationship. When the pair was publicly denounced by Cynics in the theatre, Titus acceded to the pressure and sent her away, but his reputation suffered further regardless.

==Emperor==
=== Succession ===
Vespasian died of an infection on 23 or 24 June 79 AD, and was immediately succeeded by his son Titus. He was the first Roman emperor to come to the throne after his own biological father. As Pharaoh of Egypt, Titus adopted the titulary &quot;Autokrator Titos Kaisaros Hununefer Benermerut&quot; (&quot;Emperor Titus Caesar, the perfect and popular youth&quot;). Because of his many (alleged) vices, many Romans feared that he would be another Nero. Against those expectations, however, Titus proved to be an effective emperor and was well loved by the population, who praised him highly when they found that he possessed the greatest virtues, instead of vices.

One of his first acts as emperor was to order a halt to trials based on treason charges, which had long plagued the principate. The law of treason, or law of majestas, was originally intended to prosecute those who had corruptly &quot;impaired the people and majesty of Rome&quot; by any revolutionary action. Under Augustus, however, that custom had been revived and applied to cover slander and libel as well. This led to numerous trials and executions under Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero, and the formation of networks of informers (&quot;delators&quot;), which terrorised Rome&#x27;s political system for decades.

Titus put an end to that practice against himself or anyone else and declared:

It is impossible for me to be insulted or abused in any way. For I do naught that deserves censure, and I care not for what is reported falsely. As for the emperors who are dead and gone, they will avenge themselves in case anyone does them a wrong, if in very truth they are demigods and possess any power.

Consequently, no senators were put to death during his reign; he thus kept to his promise that he would assume the office of Pontifex Maximus &quot;for the purpose of keeping his hands unstained&quot;. Informants were publicly punished and banished from the city. Titus further prevented abuses by making it unlawful for a person to be tried under different laws for the same offense. Finally, when Berenice returned to Rome, he sent her away.

As emperor, he became known for his generosity, and Suetonius states that upon realising he had brought no benefit to anyone during a whole day he remarked, &quot;Friends, I have lost a day&quot;.

===Challenges===

Although Titus&#x27;s brief reign was marked by a relative absence of major military or political conflicts, he faced a number of major disasters. A few months after his accession, Mount Vesuvius erupted. The eruption almost completely destroyed the cities and resort communities around the Bay of Naples. The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under metres of stone and ash, killing thousands. Titus appointed two ex-consuls to organise and coordinate the relief effort and personally donated large amounts of money from the imperial treasury to aid the victims of the volcano. Additionally, he visited Pompeii once after the eruption and again the following year.

During the second visit, in spring of 80, a fire broke out in Rome and burned large parts of the city for three days and three nights. Although the extent of the damage was not as disastrous as during the Great Fire of 64 and crucially spared the many districts of insulae, Cassius Dio records a long list of important public buildings that were destroyed, including Agrippa&#x27;s Pantheon, the Temple of Jupiter, the Diribitorium, parts of the Theatre of Pompey, and the Saepta Julia among others. Once again, Titus personally compensated for the damaged regions. According to Suetonius, a plague also broke out during the fire. The nature of the disease, however, and the death toll are unknown.

Meanwhile, war had resumed in Britannia, where Gnaeus Julius Agricola pushed further into Caledonia and managed to establish several forts there. As a result of his actions, Titus received the title of imperator for the fifteenth time, between 9 September and 31 December 79 AD.

His reign also saw the rebellion led by Terentius Maximus, one of several false Neros who appeared throughout the 70s. Although Nero was primarily known as a universally-hated tyrant, there is evidence that for much of his reign, he remained highly popular in the eastern provinces. Reports that Nero had survived his overthrow were fuelled by the confusing circumstances of his death and several prophecies foretelling his return.

According to Cassius Dio, Terentius Maximus resembled Nero in voice and appearance and, like him, sang to the lyre. Terentius established a following in Asia Minor but was soon forced to flee beyond the Euphrates and took refuge with the Parthians. In addition, sources state that Titus discovered that his brother Domitian was plotting against him but refused to have him killed or banished.

===Public works===
Construction of the Flavian Amphitheatre, now better known as the Colosseum, was begun in 70 under Vespasian and was finally completed in 80 under Titus. In addition to providing spectacular entertainments to the Roman populace, the building was also conceived as a gigantic triumphal monument to commemorate the military achievements of the Flavians during the Jewish Wars.

The inaugural games lasted for a hundred days and were said to be extremely elaborate, including gladiatorial combat, fights between wild animals (elephants and cranes), mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races. During the games, wooden balls were dropped into the audience, inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold or even slaves), which could then be traded for the designated item.

Adjacent to the amphitheatre, within the precinct of Nero&#x27;s Golden House, Titus had also ordered the construction of a new public bath house, the Baths of Titus. Construction of the building was hastily finished to coincide with the completion of the Flavian Amphitheatre.

Practice of the imperial cult was revived by Titus, but apparently, it met with some difficulty since Vespasian was not deified until six months after his death. To honour and glorify the Flavian dynasty further, foundations were laid for what would later become the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, which was finished by Domitian.

===Death===

At the closing of the games, Titus officially dedicated the amphitheatre and the baths in what was his final recorded act as Emperor. He set out for the Sabine territories but fell ill at the first posting station where he died of a fever, reportedly in the same farmhouse as his father. Allegedly, the last words he uttered before passing away were &quot;I have made but one mistake&quot;.

Titus had ruled the Roman Empire for just over two years: from the death of his father in 79 to his own on 13 September 81. He was succeeded by Domitian, whose first act as emperor was to deify his brother.

Historians have speculated on the exact nature of his death and to which mistake Titus alluded in his final words. Philostratus wrote that he was poisoned by Domitian with a sea hare (&quot;Aplysia depilans&quot;) and that his death had been foretold to him by Apollonius of Tyana. Suetonius and Cassius Dio maintain that he died of natural causes, but both accuse Domitian of having left the ailing Titus for dead. Consequently, Dio believed the mistake to refer to not having Titus&#x27;s brother executed when he was found to be openly plotting against him.

The Babylonian Talmud (Gittin 56b) attributes Titus&#x27;s death to an insect that flew into his nose and picked at his brain for seven years in a repetition of another legend referring to the biblical King Nimrod. According to Rabbinic literature, Titus was a descendant of Esau and dared to challenge the Lord. Jewish tradition says that Titus was plagued by God for destroying the second Temple and died as a result of a gnat going up his nose, causing a large growth inside of his brain that killed him. A story is recorded in which Onkelos, a nephew of the Roman emperor Titus who destroyed the Second Temple, intent on converting to Judaism, summons up spirits to help make up his mind. Each describes his punishment in the afterlife.&quot;Onkelos son of Kolonikos ... went and raised Titus from the dead by magical arts, and asked him; &#x27;Who is most in repute in the [other] world? He replied: Israel. What then, he said, about joining them? He said: Their observances are burdensome and you will not be able to carry them out. Go and attack them in that world and you will be at the top as it is written, Her adversaries are become the head etc.; whoever harasses Israel becomes head. He asked him: What is your punishment [in the other world]? He replied: What I decreed for myself. Every day my ashes are collected and sentence is passed on me and I am burnt and my ashes are scattered over the seven seas...&quot;

===Historiography===

Titus&#x27;s record among ancient historians stands as one of the most exemplary of any emperor. The extant accounts from the period, many of them written by his contemporaries, present a highly favourable view toward Titus. His character has especially prospered in comparison with that of his brother Domitian. &quot;The Wars of the Jews&quot; offers a witness account of the Jewish rebellion and the character of Titus. The neutrality of Josephus&#x27;s writings has been questioned as he was indebted to the Flavians. In 71, he arrived in Rome in the entourage of Titus, became a Roman citizen and took on the Roman nomen Flavius and praenomen Titus from his patrons. He received an annual pension and lived in the palace.

It was in Rome and under Flavian patronage that Josephus wrote all of his known works. &quot;The War of the Jews&quot; is biased against the leaders of the revolt by portraying the rebellion as weak and unorganised and even blaming the Jews for causing the war. His credibility as a historian was later questioned.

Another contemporary of Titus was Publius Cornelius Tacitus, who started his public career in 80 or 81 and credits the Flavian dynasty with his elevation. &quot;The Histories&quot;, his account of the period, was published during the reign of Trajan. Unfortunately only the first five books from this work have survived, with the text on Titus&#x27;s and Domitian&#x27;s reigns lost.

Suetonius Tranquilius gives a short but highly favourable account on Titus&#x27;s reign in &quot;The Lives of Twelve Caesars&quot;, emphasising his military achievements and his generosity as emperor.

Titus, of the same surname as his father, was the delight and darling of the human race; such surpassing ability had he, by nature, art, or good fortune, to win the affections of all men, and that, too, which is no easy task, while he was emperor.

Cassius Dio wrote his &quot;Roman History&quot; over 100 years after the death of Titus. He shares a similar outlook as Suetonius, possibly even using the latter as a source but is more reserved by noting that

His satisfactory record may also have been due to the fact that he survived his accession but a very short time, for he was thus given no opportunity for wrongdoing. For he lived after this only two years, two months and twenty days—in addition to the thirty-nine years, five months and twenty-five days he had already lived at that time. In this respect, indeed, he is regarded as having equalled the long reign of Augustus, since it is maintained that Augustus would never have been loved had he lived a shorter time, nor Titus had he lived longer. For Augustus, though at the outset he showed himself rather harsh because of the wars and the factional strife, was later able, in the course of time, to achieve a brilliant reputation for his kindly deeds; Titus, on the other hand, ruled with mildness and died at the height of his glory, whereas, if he had lived a long time, it might have been shown that he owes his present fame more to good fortune than to merit.

Pliny the Elder, who died during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, dedicated his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; to Titus.

In contrast to the ideal portrayal of Titus in Roman histories, Jewish memory has &quot;Titus the Wicked&quot; remembered as an evil oppressor and destroyer of the Temple. A legend in the Babylonian Talmud described Titus as having had sex with a prostitute on a Torah scroll inside the Temple during its destruction.

===In later arts===

The war in Judaea and the life of Titus, particularly his relationship with Berenice, have inspired writers and artists through the centuries. The bas-relief in the Arch of Titus has been influential in the depiction of the destruction of Jerusalem, with the Menorah frequently being used to symbolise the looting of the Second Temple.

<text>North Brabant ( ; ), also unofficially called Brabant, Dutch Brabant or Hollandic Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands. It borders the provinces of South Holland and Gelderland to the north, Limburg to the east, Zeeland to the west, and the Flemish provinces of Antwerp and Limburg to the south. The northern border follows the Meuse westward to its mouth in the Hollands Diep strait, part of the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta. North Brabant had a population of about 2,626,000 as of January 2023. Major cities in North Brabant are Eindhoven (pop. 231,642), Tilburg (pop. 217,259), Breda (pop. 183,873), its provincial capital &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch (pop. 154,205), and Helmond (pop. 94,967)

== History ==

The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 19th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands.

Present-day North Brabant (&quot;Staats-Brabant&quot;) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794.

Until the 17th century, the area that now makes up the province of North Brabant was mostly part of the Duchy of Brabant, of which the southern part is now in Belgium. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the area experienced a golden age—especially the now-Belgian cities of Brussels, Mechelen, Leuven and Antwerp, and the Dutch cities of Breda, Bergen op Zoom and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

After the Union of Utrecht was signed in 1579, Brabant became a battlefield between the Protestant Dutch Republic and Catholic Spain, which occupied the southern Netherlands. As a result of the Peace of Westphalia, the northern part of Brabant became part of the Netherlands as the territory of Staats-Brabant (Statal Brabant) under federal rule, in contrast to the founding provinces of the Dutch Republic, which were self-governing.

Attempts to introduce Protestantism into the region were largely unsuccessful; North Brabant remained strongly Catholic. For over a century, North Brabant served mainly as a military buffer zone. In 1796, when the confederate Dutch Republic became the unitary Batavian Republic, Staats-Brabant became a province as &quot;Bataafs Brabant&quot;. This status ended with the reorganisation by the invading French, and the area was united into the &quot;département&quot; of Deux-Nèthes (present province of Antwerp).

In 1815, Belgium and the Netherlands were united in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the province of North Brabant was established and so named to distinguish it from Central Brabant and South Brabant in present-day Belgium, which seceded from the Kingdom in 1830. This boundary between the Netherlands and Belgium is special in that it does not form a contiguous line, but leaves a handful of tiny enclaves (and enclaves inside enclaves) on both sides of the border. In fact, the Dutch government generally used the pre-Napoleonic borders in 1815 to divide its provinces, in hommage to the principle of Restoration. A few of these irregularities were corrected (Luyksgestel was exchanged for Lommel), Huijbergen became totally Dutch, but some remain, notably Baarle-Hertog (Belgian) and Baarle-Nassau (Dutch).

When the present province was instituted, its territory was expanded with a part of the province of Holland and the former territory of Ravenstein, which had previously belonged to the Duchy of Cleves, as well as several small, formerly autonomous entities.

In World War II the area was liberated by the allies during Operation Pheasant between October 20 to November 4, 1944.

The period from 1900 until the late 1960s is called &quot;Het Rijke Roomse Leven&quot; (translated as &#x27;the rich Roman life&#x27;, with &#x27;Roman&#x27; meaning &#x27;Roman Catholic&#x27;), an era of strong religious belief. &quot;Het Rijke Roomse Leven&quot; came about as result of the emancipatory drive of the province&#x27;s disadvantaged Catholic population and was supported by a Roman Catholic pillar, which was directed by the clergy, and not only encompassed churches, but also Roman Catholic schools and hospitals, which were run by nuns and friars. In those days every village in North Brabant had a convent from which the nuns operated. Politically, the province was dominated by Catholic parties: the Roman Catholic State Party and its post-war successor, the Catholic People&#x27;s Party, which often held around 75% of the vote.
In the 1960s secularisation and the actual emancipation of the Catholic population brought about the gradual dissolution of the Catholic pillar, as church attendance decreased in North Brabant as elsewhere in Western Europe. The influence of &quot;Het Rijke Roomse Leven&quot; (The Rich Roman [Catholic] Life) remains in the form of education where some schools are still Roman Catholic (today run by professional teachers and not by nuns) and in North Brabant&#x27;s culture, politics, mentality and customs, such as carnival. 

The interpretation of the Roman Catholic identity in North Brabant has shifted during the last 65 years from religious to cultural, but the province still has a distinct Catholic atmosphere when compared to the provinces north of the major rivers. A cultural divide is still found between the &quot;Catholic&quot; south and the &quot;Protestant&quot; north, but with a total of 1.5 million people and 20% of the industrial production in the Netherlands the southern &quot;Catholic&quot; area BrabantStad has become one of the major economically important, metropolitan regions of the Netherlands. As of 2010, Catholics were no longer a majority of the population in the province of North Brabant. Only 1–2% of the total population of the Catholic area attend mass, and these churchgoers consist mostly of people over 65 years old.

== Geography ==
With a population density of 501/km2, North Brabant is above average urbanized. The urbanization is at the center of the province at largest, where the &#x27;kite&#x27; (the Brabantse Stedenrij Breda, Tilburg, Eindhoven and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch) is located, the rest of the province has a more rural character. The province has preserved some of its scenic nature well. National parks are found at the Loonse and Drunen Dunes, De Biesbosch and De De Groote Peel, on the marshes of the Meierij at Oisterwijk and Boxtel (within an area called Het Groene Woud), the border park Zoom-Kalmthoutse Heide, and in the forested area around Breda. Also, south of Eindhoven named De Kempen is an area with farmlands and forests. In Heeze, also south of Eindhoven, are the heath areas the &quot;Groote Heide&quot; (333 ha) and Strabrechtse Heath (1500 ha) located. The &quot;Strabrechtse Heide&quot; holds also the largest fen of the Netherlands. The &quot;Beuven&quot; (Beu fen) measures 85 hectares.

Like most of the Netherlands, North Brabant is mostly flat but nearly every part of North Brabant is above sea level; therefore, there are not as many canals as in the lower parts of The Netherlands. Although most of the population lives in urban areas, the province is scattered with villages around which most of the land is cultivated.

National Parks in North Brabant are:
* De Biesbosch; National Park; North Brabant / South Holland; 7.100 ha; 1994
* De Zoom-Kalmthoutse Heide; Cross-Border Park; North Brabant / Antwerp (Belgium); 3.750 ha; 2001
* De Loonse en Drunense Duinen; National Park; North Brabant; 3.400 ha; 2002
* De Grote Peel; National Park; North Brabant / Limburg; 1.340 ha; 1993

===De Biesbosch===
The Biesbosch (from &quot;bies&quot;, &quot;rushes&quot;, and &quot;bosch&quot;, &quot;woodland&quot;) is an area southeast of Dordrecht formed when the dike on the Meuse burst and the St. Elizabeth&#x27;s floods on 19 November 1421 engulfed great tracts of land in the southwestern Netherlands and altered the geography of the whole area, inundating over 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres) of land. More than four-fifths of the flooded land has been reclaimed since the 18th century. An area of 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres) was left as it was, and now forms the Biesbosch nature reserve and bird sanctuary.
Until the end of the 1960s the Biesbosch was directly connected with the sea and subject to changing tide levels. As a result, it developed a flora which tolerated brackish water and was the home of numerous waterfowl. Since the damming of the Haringvliet there is no variation in water level, and both flora and fauna have adapted to the new environment.
The Biesbosch is crisscrossed by a network of footpaths and bike paths and by rivers and streams which offer facilities for water sports (sailing, surfing). In spite of the large numbers of visitors the natural environment has remained largely unspoiled.
The Biesbosch nature reserve can be reached by car only from the east (preferably via Werkendam). The southwest part of the area, with its three large reservoirs of drinking water, is closed to road traffic. The Biesbosch can also be reached by boat from Drimmelen, Geertruidenberg or Lage Zwaluwe.

=== De Kempen ===
The historical region of Kempen occupies the southern part of the province of Noord-Brabant and extends south of Eindhoven far into northern Belgium. To the east it reaches as far as the Meuse valley. The surface topography of De Kempen is very uniform. Most of it lies between 5 m (15 ft) and 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. The basement rocks are Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments, which are overlaid by Ice Age gravels and sands carried here by rivers of melt-water from the retreating glaciers. It is a typical area of sandy heathland.
The infertile soil is suitable only for undemanding crops such as rye, oats, potatoes and fodder plants; this limits the profitability of agriculture. Until a few decades ago Kempen was a region of heathland and sand drifts with a sparse growth of pines, a few scattered villages subsisting on the poor soil and some small towns; and this is still the pattern in much of the region.
In recent years, however, the rapid advance of industry has brought about profound changes in this agricultural region. The origins of this industrial development go back 70–100 years. The main concentrations of industry are along the southern frontier of the Netherlands, e.g., at Eindhoven, Helmond, Tilburg, Breda, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

===De Peel===
In the east of Noord-Brabant, near the Limburgish border, is the Peel area, an expanse of moorland extending from Eindhoven to Venlo, on the border with Limburg. Southeast of Asten is a nature reserve (1,300 hectares (3,250 acres); visitor center at Ospeldijk) which has escaped destruction by peat cutting. Mostly boggy, it will appeal to nature lovers with its interesting flora and fauna. Apart from this small area almost the whole of the Peel has been brought into cultivation.

===Rivers and deltas===
The province is bordered by the river Meuse in the north. Its delta flows through De Biesbosch area, a national park.

=== Municipalities ===
North Brabant has been divided into 56 municipalities since 2022. Traditionally, almost every town was a separate municipality, but their number was reduced greatly in the 1990s by incorporating smaller towns into neighbouring cities or by other mergers. The municipalities in North Brabant are:

On 1 January 2021 the municipality of Haaren merged into the existing municipalities of Boxtel, Oisterwijk, Tilburg, and Vught.
On 1 January 2022 the municipalities of Landerd and Uden merged into the new municipality of Maashorst, and the municipalities of Boxmeer, Cuijk, Grave, Mill en Sint Hubert, and Sint Anthonis merged into the new municipality of Land van Cuijk.

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 116.1 billion € in 2018, accounting for 15.0% of the Netherlands economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €39,900 or 132% of the EU27 average in the same year.

Employment is found in the agricultural, industrial and service sectors, with agricultural and food processing companies such as Agrifirm, Bavaria, FrieslandCampina, Mars Incorporated, Nutreco, Royal Canin all having large production sites or their headquarters located in the province. The main agricultural products are sweetcorn, wheat and sugar beet, while cows and pigs are held as livestock.

An important economical activity is electronics industry, which developed as a spin-off from Philips. Several companies originated from Philips, such as Signify (formerly Philips Lighting), NXP (producer of semiconductors), and the world&#x27;s largest supplier of photolithography systems, ASML.
There are eight &#x27;innovation campusses&#x27; in North Brabant, including the High Tech Campus Eindhoven. In 2017, Brabantian companies applied for 3655 patents, earning a spot in the regional top 5 in Europe.

Other important industries are automobile production (e.g. General Motors in Breda, Tesla in Tilburg) and DAF in Eindhoven, textile and shoes.

In the 20th century, tourism has become an important sector for North Brabant. A tourist attraction is theme park Efteling in Kaatsheuvel, the largest of the Benelux.
Safaripark Beekse Bergen is an Safaripark located between Tilburg and Hilvarenbeek. In terms of area, it is the largest Safaripark in the Benelux. More than 150 animal species are kept, ranging from small mammals to large birds. It is best known for its diversity. You can explore the park on foot, by boat, bus or with your own car.
BrabantStad is a partnership between the municipalities of Breda, Eindhoven, Helmond, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Tilburg and the province of North Brabant. According to national rules, BrabantStad is defined as the area of Eindhoven, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Tilburg.

==Language==

Brabantian is not a minority language in the Netherlands. It can be divided in two main dialects: East Brabantian and . Along with the Hollandic dialects it is one of the two most spoken versions of Dutch. Brabantian has, as compared to the other main Dutch dialects, had a big influence on the development of Standard Dutch. This is because Brabant was the dominant region in the Netherlands when the standardization of Dutch started in the 16th century. The first major formation of standard Dutch also took place in Antwerp, where a Brabantian dialect is spoken. The default language having been developed around this time, it therefore had mainly Brabantian influences. The early modern Dutch written language was initially influenced primarily by Brabantian, with strong influence from Hollandic emerging after the 16th century. Since the Brabantian dialect has developed faster than 16th- and 17th-century Dutch, it has become more diverse than modern Standard Dutch but is still quite similar and very understandable.
About one third of the Dutch-speaking population lives in the Brabantian dialect zone. Both in Brabantian cities such as Breda and Eindhoven and in rural areas many people still speak the original dialect or colloquial Dutch with a typical &quot;southern&quot; tongue. Tilburg and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch have a large number of people speaking the Brabantian dialect.

==Culture==
There are many museums, especially in the larger cities which include the North Brabant Museum in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, the Museum of the Image in Breda, Noordbrabants Natuurmuseum in Tilburg. Also a few towns have a large theater like the Chassé Theater in Breda and the Eindhoven Park Theatre. Large, reputable music venues like the 013 in Tilburg, which boasts the largest space of music venues in the Netherlands, and the Effenaar in Eindhoven offer concerts by major artists. Smaller venues like Mezz Breda, W2 Concert in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and the smaller halls of the 013 and the Effenaar offer concerts by emerging artists and bigger names in an intimate setting.

===Cuisine===
The Southern Dutch cuisine constitutes the cuisine of the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Limburg and the Flemish Region in Belgium. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews, and vegetable dishes and is often called &quot;Burgundian&quot;, which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages and was renowned for its splendor and great feasts.

It is the only Dutch culinary region which developed an &quot;haute cuisine&quot;, as it is influenced by both German cuisine and French cuisine, and it forms the base of most traditional Dutch restaurants including typical main courses such as &quot;Biefstuk&quot;, &quot;Varkenshaas&quot;, or &quot;Ossenhaas&quot;, which are premium cuts of meat, generally pork or beef, accompanied by various sauces and potatoes which have been double fried in the traditional Dutch (or Belgian) manner.

Stews, such as &quot;hachee&quot;, a stew of onions, beef and a thick gravy, contain a lot of flavour and require hours to prepare. Vegetable soups are made from richly flavored stock or bouillon and typically contain small meatballs alongside a variety of different vegetables. Asparagus and &quot;witlo(o)f&quot; are highly prized and traditionally eaten with cheese and/or ham.

Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the &quot;Moorkop&quot; and &quot;Bossche Bol&quot; from Brabant, are typical pastries. There are also savory pastries, especially the popular &quot;worstenbroodje&quot; (a roll with a sausage of ground beef).

The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from &quot;Trappist&quot; to &quot;Kriek&quot;. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking, often in stews.

===Sports===


====Association football====
North Brabant is home to 8 professional football clubs, more than any other province in the Netherlands. Two clubs (PSV and RKC Waalwijk) play in the Eredivisie, the highest professional football league in the Netherlands. Six clubs (Helmond Sport, Willem II, FC Den Bosch, FC Eindhoven, TOP Oss and NAC Breda) play in the Eerste Divisie, the second-highest division of professional football in the Netherlands. PSV Eindhoven is the biggest club of North Brabant, and most successful with 25 Eredivisie titles, 1 European Cup and 1 UEFA Cup, among many other domestic cups, and is one of the traditional &quot;big three&quot; clubs in the Netherlands.


====Hockey====
North Brabant is home to 3 hockey clubs that play in the Hoofdklasse. HC Den Bosch (&#x27;s-Hertogenbosch), Oranje Zwart (Eindhoven) and MOP (Vught). Oranje Zwart is the most successful of these clubs with many prizes, in the regular competition as well as in Europe. The most recent prizes are National Champions in 2014–2015, 2015–2016 and European Champions in 2014–2015.

==Politics==

The States of North Brabant (&quot;Staten van Noord-Brabant&quot;) have 55 seats and are headed by the King&#x27;s Commissioner (&quot;Commissaris van de Koning&quot;), currently Ina Adema. Whereas the provincial council (the States-Provincial - &quot;Provinciale Staten&quot;) is elected by the inhabitants, the Commissioner is appointed by the King and the cabinet of the Netherlands. With 10 seats, People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy is the largest party in the council, closely followed by Christian Democratic Appeal and Socialist Party, both with 9 seats.

The daily affairs of the province are taken care of by the Provincial-Executive (&quot;Gedeputeerde Staten&quot;), which are also headed by the Commissioner; its members (commissioners - &quot;gedeputeerden&quot;) can be compared with ministers.

==Religion==

Traditionally the province of North Brabant has been strongly Roman Catholic, in contrast to most of the rest of the Netherlands. Following the country&#x27;s independence, Catholics faced discrimination by the Protestant government until the mid-19th century. During the 1960s the relatively strong demarcation between the Catholic south on one side and the Calvinist west and north on the other side of the Netherlands started to diminish. In the second half of the 20th century a rapid secularization took place in North Brabant.

In 2015 slightly fewer than half (48%) of the Brabantian people reported adhering to Catholicism, while 5.6% adhered to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, 4.4% to Islam, 3.3% to other churches or faiths. More than a third (38.8%) of the population identified as non-religious. 

Although much of the population identifies as Catholic, regular attendance at Mass is low. For example, in the Diocese of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, the eastern part of North Brabant and part of the province of Gelderland, 1,167,000 people reported in 2006 an association with Roman Catholicism (56.8 percent of the population). However, only 45,645 residents of this area attended the mass on average, which was only 2 percent of the total population of the area. In western North Brabant (Diocese of Breda) the number of people associating themselves with Catholicism also strongly decreased; only 52 percent of the West Brabantians identify as Roman Catholic. Church attendance was even lower in the west, with only 1 percent of the West Brabantian population attending Mass. North Brabant is mostly Catholic by tradition. Residents may adhere to certain traditions as a base for their cultural identity, but the vast majority of the Catholic population is now largely irreligious in practice. Research among Catholics in the Netherlands in 2007 showed that only 27% of the Dutch Catholics could be regarded as theist, while 55% were ietsist or nontheist and 17% were agnostic.

<text>A road train, also known as a land train or long combination vehicle (LCV) is a semi-trailer used to move road freight more efficiently than single-trailer semi-trailers. It consists of one semi-trailer or more connected together with or without a prime-mover. It typically has to be at least three trailers and one prime-mover. Road trains are often used in areas where other forms of heavy transport (freight train, cargo aircraft, container ship) are not feasible or practical.

== History ==
Early road trains consisted of traction engines pulling multiple wagons. The first identified road trains operated into South Australia&#x27;s Flinders Ranges from the Port Augusta area in the mid-19th century. They displaced bullock teams for the carriage of minerals to port and were, in turn, superseded by railways.

During the Crimean War, a traction engine was used to pull multiple open trucks. By 1898 steam traction engine trains with up to four wagons were employed in military manoeuvres in England.

In 1900, John Fowler &amp; Co. provided armoured road trains for use by the British Armed Forces in the Second Boer War. Lord Kitchener stated that he had around 45 steam road trains at his disposal.

A road train devised by Captain Charles Renard of the French Engineering Corps was displayed at the 1903 Paris Salon. After his death, Daimler, which had acquired the rights, attempted to market it in the United Kingdom. Four of these vehicles were successfully delivered to Queensland, Australia, before the company ceased production upon the start of World War I.

In the 1930s/40s, the government of Australia operated an AEC Roadtrain to transport freight and supplies into the Northern Territory, replacing the Afghan camel trains that had been trekking through the deserts since the late 19th century. This truck pulled two or three Dyson four-axle self-tracking trailers. At , the AEC was grossly underpowered by today&#x27;s standards, and drivers and offsiders (a partner or assistant) routinely froze in winter and sweltered in summer due to the truck&#x27;s open cab design and the position of the engine radiator, with its cooling fan, behind the seats.

Australian Kurt Johannsen, a bush mechanic, is recognised as the inventor of the modern road train. After transporting stud bulls to an outback property, Johannsen was challenged to build a truck to carry 100 head of cattle instead of the original load of 20. Provided with financing of about 2000 pounds and inspired by the tracking abilities of the Government roadtrain, Johannsen began construction. Two years later his first road train was running.

Johannsen&#x27;s first road train consisted of a United States Army World War II surplus Diamond-T tank carrier, nicknamed &quot;Bertha&quot;, and two home-built self-tracking trailers. Both wheel sets on each trailer could steer, and therefore could negotiate the tight and narrow tracks and creek crossings that existed throughout Central Australia in the earlier part of the 20th century. Freighter Trailers in Australia viewed this improved invention and went on to build self-tracking trailers for Kurt and other customers, and went on to become innovators in transport machinery for Australia.

This first example of the modern road train, along with the AEC Government Roadtrain, forms part of the huge collection at the National Road Transport Hall of Fame in Alice Springs, Northern Territory.

In 2023, Janus launched the first BEV triple road train with 620 kWh battery, also the world&#x27;s heaviest street-legal BEV truck at 170 tonnes (gross weight).

== Usage ==
=== Australia ===

The term &quot;road train&quot; is used in Australia and typically means a prime mover hauling two or more trailers, other than a B-double. In contrast with a more common semi-trailer towing one trailer or semi-trailer, the diesel prime mover of a road train hauls two or more trailers or semi-trailers. Australia has the longest and heaviest road-legal road trains in the world, weighing up to .

Double (two-trailer) road train combinations are allowed on some roads in most states of Australia, including specified approaches to the ports and industrial areas of Adelaide, South Australia and Perth, Western Australia. An A-double road train should not be confused with a , which is allowed access to most of the country and in all major cities.

In South Australia, B-triples up to and two-trailer road trains to were only permitted to travel on a small number of approved routes in the north and west of the state, including access to Adelaide&#x27;s north-western suburban industrial and export areas such as Port Adelaide, Gillman and Outer Harbour via Salisbury Highway, Port Wakefield Road and Augusta Highway before 2017. A project named &quot;Improving Road Transport for the Agriculture Industry&quot; added of key routes permitted to operate vehicles over in 2015–2018.

Triple (three-trailer) road trains operate in western New South Wales, western Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, with the last three states also allowing AB-quads (B double with two additional trailers coupled behind). Darwin is the only capital city in the world where triples and quads are allowed to within of the central business district (CBD).

Strict regulations regarding licensing, registration, weights, and experience apply to all operators of road trains throughout Australia.

Road trains are used for transporting all manner of materials: common examples are livestock, fuel, mineral ores, and general freight. Their cost-effective transport has played a significant part in the economic development of remote areas; some communities are totally reliant on regular service.

When road trains get close to populated areas, the multiple dog-trailers are unhooked, the dollies removed and then connected individually to multiple trucks at &quot;assembly&quot; yards.

When the flat-top trailers of a road train need to be transported empty, it is common practice to stack them. This is commonly referred to as &quot;doubled-up&quot; or &quot;doubling-up&quot;. Sometimes, if many trailers are required to be moved at one time, they will be triple-stacked, or &quot;tripled-up&quot;.

Higher Mass Limits (HML) Schemes are now in all jurisdictions in Australia, allowing trucks to carry additional weight beyond general mass limits. Some roads in some states regularly allowing up to 4 trailers at long and . On private property like mines, highway restrictions on trailer length, weight and count may not apply. Some of the heaviest road trains carrying ore are multiple unit with a diesel engine in each trailer, controlled by the tractor.

Diesel sales in Australia (per year) are around 32 billion litres, of which some is used by road trains. In order to reduce emissions and running cost, trials are made with road trains powered by batteries.

=== United States ===
In the United States, trucks on public roads are limited to two trailers (two and a dolly to connect; the limit is end to end). Some states allow three trailers, although triples are usually restricted to less populous states such as Idaho, Oregon, and Montana, plus the Ohio Turnpike and Indiana East–West Toll Road. Triples are used for long-distance less-than-truckload freight hauling (in which case the trailers are shorter than a typical single-unit trailer) or resource hauling in the interior west (such as ore or aggregate). Triples are sometimes marked with &quot;LONG LOAD&quot; banners both front and rear. &quot;Turnpike doubles&quot;—tractors towing two full-length trailers—are allowed on the New York Thruway and Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90), Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, Kansas Turnpike (Kansas City – Wichita route) as well as the Ohio and Indiana toll roads. Colorado allows what are known as &quot;Rocky Mountain Doubles&quot; which is one full length trailer and an additional trailer. The term &quot;road train&quot; is not commonly used in the United States; &quot;turnpike train&quot; has been used, generally in a pejorative sense.
In the western United States LCVs are allowed on many Interstate highways. The only LCVs allowed nationwide are STAA doubles.

On private property like farms, highway restrictions on trailer length and count do not apply. Bales of straw, for example, are sometimes moved in wagon trains of up to 20 trailers an eighth of a mile long (carrying a total of 3,600 bales).

=== Europe ===
In Finland, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, and some roads in Norway, trucks with trailers are allowed to be long. In Finland, a length of has been allowed since January 2019. In Sweden, this length has been allowed on several major roads, including all of E4, since August 2023. 34.5 meters allows two 40 foot containers.

Elsewhere in the European Union, the limit is (Norway ). The trucks are of a cab-over-engine design, with a flat front and a high floor, about above ground. The Scandinavian countries are less densely populated than the other EU countries, and distances, especially in Finland and Sweden, are long. Until the late 1960s, vehicle length was unlimited, giving rise to long vehicles to cost effectively handle goods. As traffic increased, truck lengths became more of a concern and they were limited, albeit at a more generous level than in the rest of Europe.

In the United Kingdom in 2009, a two-year desk study of Longer Heavier Vehicles (LHVs), including up to 11-axle, long, combinations, ruled out all road-train-type vehicles for the foreseeable future.
In 2010, Sweden was performing tests on log-hauling trucks, weighing up to and measuring and haulers for two 40 ft containers, measuring in total. In 2015, a pilot began in Finland to test a 104-tonne timber lorry which was and had 13 axles. Testing of the special lorry was limited to a predefined route in northern Finland

Since 2015, Spain has permitted B-doubles with a length of up to and weighing up to 60 tonnes to travel on certain routes. In July 2024, after 5 years of testing, HCTs have been permitted on Spanish territory, with lengths of up to 32 meters (105 ft) and 70 gross tonnes.

Since 2016, Eoin Gavin Transport, Shannon and Dennison Trailers, Kildare have been trialling B-doubles on the Irish motorways. In Feb 2024, The Pallet Network announced four B-doubles to operate between Dublin, Cork and Galway.

In 2020, a small number of road trains were operating between Belgium and the Netherlands.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico road trains exist in a limited capacity due to the sizes of roads in its larger cities, and they are only allowed to pull 2 trailers joined with a pup or dolly created for this purpose. Recently the regulations tend to be more severe and strict to avoid overloading and accidents, to adhere to the federal rules of transportation. Truck drivers must obtain a certificate to certify that the driver is capable to manipulate and drive that type of vehicle.

All the tractor vehicles that make road train type transport in the country (along with the normal security requirements) need to have visual warnings like;

* &quot;Warning Double Semi-Trailer&quot; () alert located in the frontal fenders of the tractor and in the rear part of each trailer,
* yellow turn and warning lights to be more visible to other drivers,
* a seal for the entire vehicle approving the use as double semi trailer,
* federal license plates in every trailer, dolly, and tractor unit.

Some major cargo enterprises in the country use this form to cut costs of carrying all type of goods in some regions where other forms of transportation are too expensive compared to it due to the difficult geography of the country.

The Mexican road train equivalent form in Australian Standard is the A-Double form, the difference is that the Mexican road trains can be hauled with a long distance tractor truck.

===Zimbabwe===

In Zimbabwe, they are only used in one highway, Ngezi – Makwiro road. They make use of 42 m long road trains pulling three trailers.

==Trailer arrangements==
===A-double===

An A-double consists of a prime mover towing a normal lead trailer with a towing hitch such as a Ringfeder coupling affixed to it at the rear. A fifth wheel dolly is then affixed to the hitch allowing another standard trailer to be attached. Eleven-axle coal tipping sets carrying to Port Kembla, Australia are described as A-doubles. The set depicted has a tare weight of and is capable of carrying of coal. Note the shield at the front of the second trailer to direct tipped coal from the first trailer downwards.

Pros include the ability to use standard semi-trailers and the potential for very large loads. Cons mainly include very tricky reversing due to the multiple articulation points across two different types of coupling.

===B-double===
A B-double consists of a prime mover towing a specialised lead trailer that has a fifth-wheel mounted on the rear towing another semi-trailer, resulting in two articulation points. It may also be known as a B-train, interlink in South Africa, B-double in Australia, tandem tractor-trailer, tandem rig or double in North America. They may typically be up to long. The fifth wheel coupling is located at the rear of the lead (first) trailer and is mounted on a &quot;tail&quot; section commonly located immediately above the lead trailer axles. In North America this area of the lead trailer is often referred to as the &quot;bridge&quot;. The twin-trailer assembly is hooked up to a tractor unit via the tractor unit&#x27;s fifth wheel in the customary manner.

An advantage of the B-train configuration is its inherent stability when compared to most other twin trailer combinations, the turntable mounted on the forward trailer results in the B-train not requiring a converter dolly as with all other road train configurations. It is this feature above all else that has ensured its continued development and global acceptance. Reversing is simpler as all articulation points are on fifth wheel couplings.

B-train trailers are used to transport many types of load and examples include tanks for liquid and dry-bulk, flat-beds and curtain-siders for deck-loads, bulkers for aggregates and wood residuals, refrigerated trailers for chilled and frozen goods, vans for dry goods, logging trailers for forestry work and cattle liners for livestock.

In Australia, standard semi-trailers are permitted on almost any road. B-doubles are more heavily regulated, but routes are made available by state governments for almost anywhere that significant road freight movement is required.

Around container ports in Australia exists what is known as a super B-double; a B-double with an extra axle (total of 4) on the lead trailer and either three or four axle set on the rear trailer. This allows the super B-Double to carry combinations of two 40 foot containers, four 20 foot containers, or a combination of one 40 foot container and two twenty foot containers. However, because of their length and low accessibility into narrow streets, these vehicles are restricted in where they can go and are generally used for terminal-to-terminal work, i.e. wharf to container holding park or wharf-to-wharf. The rear axle on each trailer can also pivot slightly while turning to prevent scrubbing out the edges of the tyres due to the heavy loads placed on them.

===B-triple===

Same as B-double, but with an additional lead trailer behind the prime mover. The B-train principle has been exploited in Australia, where configurations such as B triples, double-B doubles and 2AB quads are permitted on some routes. These are run in most states of Australia where double road trains are allowed. Australia&#x27;s National Transport Commission proposed a national framework for B-triple operations that includes basic vehicle specifications and operating conditions that the commission anticipates will replace the current state-by-state approach, which largely discourages the use of B-triples for interstate operation. In South Australia, B-triples up to and two-trailer road trains to are generally only permitted on specified routes, including access to industrial and export areas near Port Adelaide from the north.

===B quad===
In 2018, B quad was also allowed in states Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, which enables more economical transport.

===AB triple===

An AB triple consists of a standard trailer with a B-Double behind it using a converter dolly, with a trailer order of Standard, Dolly, B-Train, Standard. The final trailer may be either a B-Train with no trailer attached to it or a standard trailer. Alternatively, a BA triple sees this configuration reversed, consisting of a B-double with a converter dolly and standard trailer behind it.

===A-triple===

In South Australia, larger road trains up to (three full trailers) are only permitted on certain routes in the Far North.

===BAB quad===
A BAB quad consists of two B-double units linked with a converter dolly, with trailer order of Prime Mover, B-Train, Dolly, B-Train.

===ABB quad===
ABB quad consists of one standard trailer and B-triple units linked with a converter dolly.

===AAB quad===

AAB quad consists of A-double and B-double units linked with a converter dolly. Alternatively, a BAA quad sees this configuration reversed, first the B-double, then the A-double.

===A quad===

In some parts of Australia, &#x27;super quad&#x27; road trains up to are permitted, consisting of four standard trailers connected via three converter dollies.

===C-train===
A C-train is a semi-trailer attached to a turn table on a C-dolly. Unlike in an A-Train, the C-dolly is connected to the tractor or another trailer in front of it with two drawbars, thus eliminating the drawbar connection as an articulation point. One of the axles on a C-dolly is self-steerable to prevent tire scrubbing. C-dollies are not permitted in Australia, due to the lack of articulation.

===Dog-trailer (dog trailer)===

A dog-trailer (also called a pup) is a short trailer with a permanent dolly, with a single A-frame drawbar that fits into the Ringfeder or pintle hook on the rear of the truck or trailer in front, giving the whole unit two or more articulation points and very little roll stiffness. These are commonly used in Australia, particularly for end tipper applications like shown above. They are normally limited to a single dog trailer behind a short bodied (independently load carrying) truck with a standard length limit of 19 metres (20 under design permits). A quad dog trailer in combination with a bodied truck is able to carry more weight than a truck and single semi-trailer of the same length limit and access restrictions, as well as carrying two different materials as separate loads, such as with tipper bodies and fluid tankers.

===Interstate road transport registration in Australia===

In 1991, at a special Premiers&#x27; Conference, Australian heads of government signed an inter-governmental agreement to establish a national heavy vehicle registration, regulation and charging scheme: the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS). Its requirements are as follows:

Due to the &quot;eastern&quot; and &quot;western&quot; mass limits in Australia, two different categories of registration were enacted. The second digit of the registration plate showed what mass limit was allowed for that vehicle. If a vehicle had a &#x27;V&#x27; as the second letter, its mass limits were in line with the eastern states mass limits, which were:

* Steer axle, 1 axle, 2 tyres: 
* Steer axle, 2 axles, 2 tyres per axle: Non load sharing suspension 
** Load sharing suspension 
* Single axle, dual tyres: 
* Tandem axle, dual tyres: 
* Tri-axle, dual tyres or &#x27;super single&#x27; tyres: 
* Gross combination mass on a 6-axle vehicle not to exceed 

If a vehicle had an &quot;X&quot; as the second letter, its mass limits were in line with the western states mass limits, which were:
* Steer axle, 1 axle, 2 tyres: 
* Steer axle, 2 axles, 2 tyres per axle
** Non load sharing suspension : Load sharing suspension 
* Single axle, dual tyres: 
* Tandem axle, dual tyres: 
* Tri-axle, dual tyres or &quot;super single&quot; tyres: 
* Gross combination mass on a 6-axle vehicle not to exceed 

The second digit of the registration being a &quot;T&quot; designates a trailer.

One of the main criteria of the registration is that intrastate operation is not permitted. The load has to come from one state or territory and be delivered to another. Many grain carriers were reported and prosecuted for cartage from the paddock to the silos. However, if the load went to a port silo, they were given the benefit of the doubt, as that grain was more than likely to be going overseas.

===Signage===

Australian road trains have horizontal signs front and back with high black uppercase letters on a reflective yellow background reading &quot;ROAD TRAIN&quot;. The sign(s) must have a black border and be at least long and high and be placed between and above the ground on the fore or rearmost surface of the unit.

In the case of B-triples in Western Australia, they are signed front and rear with &quot;ROAD TRAIN&quot; until they cross the WA/SA border where they are then signed with &quot;LONG VEHICLE&quot; in the front and rear.

Converter dollies must have a sign affixed horizontally to the rearmost point, complying to the same conditions, reading &quot;LONG VEHICLE&quot;. This is required for when a dolly is towed behind a trailer.

===Combination lengths===
;B-double: max. Western Australia, max.
;B-triple: up to max.
;NTC modular B-triple: max. (uses 2× conventional B-double lead trailers)
;Pocket road train: max. (Western Australia only) This configuration is classed as a &quot;Long Vehicle&quot;.
;Double road train or AB road train: max.
;Triple and ABB or BAB-quad road trains: max.

===Operating weights===
Operational weights are based on axle group masses, as follows:
;Single axle (steer tyre): 
;Single axle (steer axle with &#x27;super single&#x27; tyres): 
;Single axle (dual tyres): 
;Tandem axle grouping: 
;Tri-axle grouping: 

Therefore, 
*A B-double (single axle steering, tandem drive, and two tri-axle groups) would have an operational weight of .
*A double road train (single axle steering, tandem drive, tri-axle, tandem, tri-axle) would have an operational weight of .
*A triple is .
*Quads weigh in at .
*Concessional weight limits, which increase allowable weight to accredited operators can see (for example) a quad weighing up to .

*If a tri-drive prime mover is utilised, along with tri-axle dollies, weights can reach nearly .

===Speed limits===
The Australian national heavy vehicle speed limit is , except New South Wales and Queensland where the speed limit for any road train is . B triple road trains have a speed limit of 100 km/h (62 mph) in Queensland.

In Canada, there has been no difference between the speed limits between cars and road trains, which range from on two-lane roads and between on three-lane roads.

In Europe, the speed limit for heavy goods trucks is usually . There is a law on having speed limiters which makes it impossible to drive heavy trucks faster than . These limits are normally the same for road trains. There is not a wish to encourage trucks to overtake slightly slower trucks on motorways because it obstacles the left lane, although common anyway e.g. when heavy road trains lose speed uphill.

==World&#x27;s longest road trains==

Below is a list of longest road trains driven in the world. Most of these had no practical use, as they were put together and driven across relatively short distances for the express purpose of record-breaking.

*In 1989, a trucker named &quot;Buddo&quot; tugged 12 trailers down the main street of Winton.
*In 1993, &quot;Plugger&quot; Bowden took the record with a Mack CLR pulling 16 trailers.
*A few months later this effort was surpassed by Darwin driver Malcolm Chisholm with a , 21-trailer rig extending .
*In April 1994 Bob Hayward and Andrew Aichison organised another attempt using a 1988 Mack Super-Liner 500 hp V8 belonging to Plugger Bowden who drove 29 stock trailers measuring 439.169 metres a distance of 4.5 km into Bourke. The record was published in the next &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. 
*Then the record went back to Winton with 34 trailers.
*On 3 April 1999, the town of Merredin, officially made it into the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, when Marleys Transport made a successful attempt on the record for the world&#x27;s longest road train. The record was created when 45 trailers, driven by Greg Marley, weighing and measuring were pulled by a Kenworth 10×6 K100G for .
*On 19 October 2000, Doug Gould set the first of his records in Kalgoorlie, when a roadtrain made up of 79 trailers, measuring and weighing , was pulled by a Kenworth C501T driven by Steven Matthews a distance of .
*On 29 March 2003, the record was surpassed near Mungindi, by a road train consisting of 87 trailers and a single prime mover (measuring in length).
*The record returned to Kalgoorlie, on 17 October 2004, when Doug Gould assembled 117 trailers for a total length of . The attempt nearly failed, as the first prime mover&#x27;s main driveshaft broke when taking off. A second truck was quickly made available, and pulled the train a distance of .
*In 2004, the record was again broken by a group from Clifton, Queensland which used a standard Mack truck to pull 120 trailers a distance of about .
*On 18 February 2006, an Australian built Mack truck with 113 semi-trailers, and long, pulled the load to recapture the record for the longest road train (multiple loaded trailers) ever pulled with a single prime mover. It was on the main road of Clifton, Queensland, that 70-year-old John Atkinson claimed a new record, pulled by a tri-drive Mack Titan.

=== Outside Australia ===
*On 12 April 2016 in Gothenburg, Sweden, a Volvo FH16 750 pulled 20 trailers with double-stacked containers with a total length of 300 meters (984 ft) and with a total weight of 750 tonnes.

<text>Asia are an English rock supergroup formed in London in 1981. The most commercially successful lineup was its original, which consisted of four members of different progressive rock bands who had enjoyed great success in the 1970s: lead vocalist and bassist John Wetton (King Crimson, Uriah Heep and U.K.), guitarist Steve Howe (Yes), keyboardist Geoff Downes (Yes and the Buggles) and drummer Carl Palmer (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer). Their self-titled debut album released in 1982, remains their best-selling album and went to number one in several countries. &quot;Billboard&quot; listed it as the top album in the U.S. in 1982. The lead single from the album, &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot;, remains their top charting and best-known song, reaching the top 40 in over a dozen markets. It peaked at #4 in the U.S. on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and hit #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart.

The band underwent multiple lineup changes before the original four members reunited in 2006. As a result, a band called Asia Featuring John Payne exists as a continuation of John Payne&#x27;s career as Asia&#x27;s frontman from 1991 until Wetton&#x27;s return in 2006. In 2013, the original lineup was broken once again when Howe retired from the band and was replaced by guitarist Sam Coulson. After a few years of inactivity, Billy Sherwood (of Yes, World Trade and ) replaced an ailing Wetton (who died shortly thereafter) in Asia for a summer 2017 tour with Journey. Following the end of the tour, the band went on hiatus again, re-emerging in 2019 with Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal replacing both Sherwood on vocals and Coulson on guitar. In 2022, Marc Bonilla joined the group as guitarist and vocalist in place of Thal, but this brief lineup of the band never performed or recorded together. In 2024, Downes announced a new touring line-up of himself, Virgil Donati, John Mitchell and Harry Whitley.

==History==
===Formation===
Asia began in early 1981 after the apparent ending of Yes and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, two of the founding bands of British progressive rock. After the breakup of King Crimson in 1974, various plans for a supergroup involving bassist John Wetton had not been successful, including the abortive British Bulldog project with Bill Bruford and Rick Wakeman in 1976. In 1977 Bruford and Wetton were reunited in U.K., augmented by guitarist Allan Holdsworth and keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson. Their self-titled debut was released in 1978. But by January 1980, U.K. had folded after one lineup change and three recordings. A new project was then suggested involving Wetton, Wakeman, drummer Carl Palmer and (then little known) guitarist/singer Trevor Rabin, but Wakeman left this project shortly before they were due to sign to Geffen and before they had played together.

In early January 1981, Wetton and former Yes guitarist Steve Howe were brought together by A&amp;R man John Kalodner and Geffen Records to start writing material for a new album. They were eventually joined by Palmer and finally by Howe&#x27;s fellow member of Yes, keyboardist Geoff Downes. Two other players auditioned and considered during the band&#x27;s formation were former The Move and ELO founder Roy Wood and the aforementioned guitarist/singer Trevor Rabin, who would end up replacing Steve Howe in a reformed Yes in 1983. Rabin, in a filmed 1984 interview included in the DVD &quot;9012Live&quot;, said that his involvement with Asia never went anywhere because &quot;there was no chemistry&quot; among the participants.

The band&#x27;s first recordings, under the auspices of Geffen record label head David Geffen and Kalodner, were extremely popular with record buyers, while considered disappointing by music critics and fans of progressive rock, who found the music closer to radio-friendly album-oriented rock (AOR). However, Asia clicked with fans of popular arena acts such as Journey and Styx; Kalodner had once introduced Wetton to Journey&#x27;s short-lived frontman Robert Fleischman, with a view to Fleischman becoming Asia&#x27;s lead singer. As they worked on material together, Fleischman was impressed by Wetton&#x27;s singing and felt the voice best suited to the new material was Wetton&#x27;s own. He left Asia amicably.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Asia&quot; an indifferent review, while acknowledging the band&#x27;s musicianship was a cut above the usual AOR expectations.

===1981–1985: &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; and early success===
Asia&#x27;s debut album &quot;Asia&quot;, released in March 1982, gained considerable commercial success, spending nine weeks at number one on the United States album chart and selling over four million copies in the States alone. The album sold over 10 million worldwide and has never been out of print. The singles &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; and &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot; became Top 40 hits, both boosted by popular MTV music videos. Both tracks went on to become stadium favourites at United States sporting events. &quot;Sole Survivor&quot; also received heavy air play on rock stations across the United States, as did &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; (another MTV video) and &quot;Here Comes The Feeling&quot;. The band&#x27;s best performing single, and perhaps their most recognised and popular hit song, &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot;, spent six weeks at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Album Rock Tracks chart and climbed to No. 4 on the Hot 100.

In the United States the band sold out every date on their debut tour, which began at Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York on 22 April 1982 and continued in theatres but quickly expanded into massive arenas because of high ticket demand. Asia would go on to receive a Grammy Award nomination as Best New Artist of 1982. MTV also played Asia videos on heavy rotation—as many as five times a day. Both &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Cash Box&quot; named Asia&#x27;s debut the No. 1 album of the year. Asia&#x27;s logo and cover art were created by illustrator Roger Dean of Yes and Uriah Heep fame.

Asia&#x27;s second album &quot;Alpha&quot; (released in August 1983) and future Asia albums did not achieve the chart success of their debut release; however, &quot;Alpha&quot;″s &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was a No. 1 Album Rock Track and Top 10 Pop hit in the summer of 1983, and the video received considerable attention on MTV, while &quot;The Smile Has Left Your Eyes&quot; was another Top 40 hit for the band. The video for &quot;Smile&quot; also scored heavy MTV play. However, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized &quot;Alpha&quot; as an &quot;over-produced commercial album&quot;, while others stated that Howe and Palmer were effectively reduced to session musicians. &quot;Alpha&quot; received indifferent reviews from various critics, while attaining platinum status and reaching No. 6 on the Billboard album chart.

In October 1983 Wetton left the group after the comparatively disappointing sales of &quot;Alpha&quot;. The band says that Wetton quit; Wetton stated that he was fired by phone. There is no universally agreed version of what happened. Wetton later said that his alcohol dependency may have been a factor. Howe, in his 2021 autobiography &quot;All My Yesterdays&quot;, says that tensions had been building gradually, as songs began to work out differently on stage than they had while recording the album, which had itself not gone smoothly. After a show in New York where some members of the band had, after giving an interview, taken the stage and given a subpar performance, Howe recalls that he, Downes and Palmer confronted Wetton about his increasing mistakes on stage.

The next leg of their 1983 United States tour (which had begun in the summer but shut down suddenly on 10 September following a performance at Pine Knob outside Detroit, Michigan), scheduled for the autumn, was abruptly cancelled, reportedly because of low ticket sales. Howe says this was because Wetton&#x27;s issues had worsened; the ensuing two-month break in the tour marked Wetton&#x27;s departure from the band as a practical matter regardless of who had initiated it.

In December 1983 ex-King Crimson and ELP lead singer and bassist Greg Lake replaced Wetton for a few concerts in Japan, including the highly publicised &quot;Asia in Asia&quot; concert at the Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo, Japan, on 6 December 1983, which was the first concert broadcast over satellite to MTV in the United States and was later made into a home video. Some songs were played in a lower key to suit Lake&#x27;s voice. He sang some lyrics assisted with a teleprompter, as he had been asked to cover Wetton&#x27;s parts on short notice as a favour to Carl Palmer; although he initially declined due to the short preparation time, eventually he accepted because Geffen Records &quot;offered me so much money there was no way I could refuse it.&quot; In a 2011 interview, asked why he had not stayed a member of Asia, he stated, &quot;I did a brief stint with them and didn&#x27;t want to go in that corporate rock direction. I didn&#x27;t believe in that sort of music, so I didn&#x27;t continue.&quot; Howe says Lake &quot;was&quot; interested in remaining a member and recording with the band but Palmer was opposed.

Following Lake&#x27;s departure in early 1984, Wetton was asked to return (in Howe&#x27;s account, Wetton approached the band via management) after a three-month absence; he returned on the condition that Howe was ousted from the band. For a while, the group considered continuing as a three-piece without a permanent guitarist, inviting guest guitarists such as Jeff Beck and David Gilmour into the studio. Geffen Records suggested recruiting Krokus guitarist Mandy Meyer, who got on well with the band and was offered a permanent position: his playing style was more inclined to straightforward hard rock, thus changing the sound of the band. Meanwhile, Howe went on to brief success with GTR (another supergroup, this one formed with former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett and produced by Geoff Downes).

===1985–1991: &quot;Astra&quot;, breakup and new lineups===
The third Asia album was tentatively titled &quot;Arcadia&quot;, but during production it was discovered that that name was being used by a forthcoming spin-off project from Duran Duran. The retitled &quot;Astra&quot;, released in November 1985, was not as commercially successful as the first two albums. The record label cancelled the planned tour because of lack of interest. The band charted another single with &quot;Go&quot; (No. 46), featuring Meyer&#x27;s guitar work as a primary element. The music video was another hit with MTV but in 1986 this Asia lineup folded, bringing the group to an end for the time being. Wetton is quoted as saying &quot;[&quot;Astra&quot;] did really well in Sweden ... but Swedish sales aren&#x27;t that large.&quot;

Wetton resurfaced in January 1987 with an album recorded with guitarist Phil Manzanera, &quot;Wetton-Manzanera&quot;, based on material that had been originally intended for Asia. Also in 1987, Wetton played with Phenomena on their &quot;Dream Runner&quot; album and landed a number one hit in South America with the Phenomena single &quot;Did It All for Love&quot;, also appearing in the related music video. 

Asia were also credited with contributing the Giorgio Moroder produced track &quot;Gypsy Soul&quot; to the Sylvester Stallone film soundtrack to &quot;Over the Top&quot; (1987), although Wetton was the only band member involved.

Wetton and Downes&#x27; attempt to restart the group in 1987 with guitarist Scott Gorham (formerly of Thin Lizzy) and drummer Michael Sturgis (ex-A-ha) failed when they were unable to land a worldwide recording deal.

Wetton and Palmer reunited the band for tours of Europe in the summer and autumn of 1989. Downes (working on a project with Greg Lake) was not available, so keyboards were played by John Young. Guitars on the tour were handled by Alan Darby (replaced by German guitarist Holger Larisch); and Zoe Nicholas and Susie Webb were brought aboard to provide back-up vocals. Unlike Wetton&#x27;s later anger at Asia continuing without him in the 1990s, this lineup was viewed favourably by other Asia band members.

Asia returned to the studio in 1990 with Downes, Toto guitarist Steve Lukather and other studio musicians and released &quot;Then &amp; Now&quot; (August 1990), a best-of with four new tracks. &quot;Days Like These&quot; from the disc received substantial airplay during the summer of 1990 on AOR radio stations and re-sparked some interest in the band. Lukather later revealed that Wetton had asked him to join the band, but he had obligations with Toto who at that time had recently come off of a short hiatus. Lukather later contributed to Wetton&#x27;s solo album &quot;Battle Lines&quot; in 1994. Instead, Pat Thrall joined Downes, Palmer and Wetton on tour and they performed classic material, including King Crimson and U.K. songs.

The band toured the former Soviet Union in November 1990 to play in front of 20,000 fans on two sold-out nights. &quot;Days Like These&quot; charted in the United States at No. 64 in 1990 and No. 2 on the United States Album Rock Tracks chart. But a U.S. tour was scrapped when various problems hampered the single&#x27;s chance at the Top 40. Asia received the RIAA Gold album award for &quot;Then and Now&quot; years later, but initially the album did not reach the Top 100. A DVD and CD are available of the Asia concerts in the USSR (featuring a bonus studio track, &quot;Kari-Anne&quot; recorded by the 1987 Wetton-Downes-Gorham-Sturgis lineup and with Francis Dunnery contributing a guitar solo). Wetton left the group in April 1991 after a South American tour, discouraged by Asia&#x27;s lack of success in the United States.

===1991–2006: Downes/Payne era===

After Wetton&#x27;s departure, vocalist/bassist John Payne joined the band and, together with Downes, enlisted new musicians and led Asia through to 2006. The first album with this lineup was &quot;Aqua&quot;, released in June 1992. In addition to Downes and Payne, the album featured Howe, Palmer, and guitarist Al Pitrelli (of Danger Danger, Megadeth and Alice Cooper). Howe returned during the sessions having just left Yes again, but Palmer would leave soon, committing to an ELP reunion, and was able to play on just three songs. Drummers Simon Phillips and Nigel Glockler then completed the sessions. Downes&#x27; environmentalist single &quot;Who Will Stop the Rain?&quot; (originally written for Max Bacon and the aborted &quot;Rain&quot; project, later appearing on Bacon&#x27;s album &quot;From the Banks of the River Irwell&quot;) attracted some radio attention. The &quot;Aqua&quot; club tour featured Howe (whose presence was heavily promoted), who took the stage after the fifth song. The tour was successful enough to warrant the band&#x27;s continuation. The 1992–93 tour featured Downes, Howe, Payne, guitarist Vinny Burns and drummer Trevor Thornton. Before a European festival tour in late 1993, Howe and Burns left and were replaced by guitarist Keith More.

The group released &quot;Aria&quot; in May 1994, which featured lead guitarist Al Pitrelli once again, who would leave Asia during the short &quot;Aria&quot; tour. The &quot;Aria&quot; album did not fare well commercially and the ensuing tour was limited to four concerts. Ex-Simply Red guitarist Aziz Ibrahim took over during the tour. &quot;Aria&quot; also introduced new drummer Michael Sturgis, who had been involved during the band&#x27;s aborted 1987 reunion and had appeared on some of the sessions for &quot;Aqua&quot;. &quot;Aria&quot; was not released in the United States until May 1995.

Over New Year&#x27;s Eve 1995/1996, a broken pipe inundated the control room in Downes&#x27; and Payne&#x27;s recording studio, Electric Palace, in London. Amid the lost equipment, a vault containing unreleased material was found intact. The band decided to release the material on two discs, &quot;Archiva 1&quot; and &quot;Archiva 2&quot;. The &quot;Archiva&quot; sets were collections of unreleased tracks recorded during the first three Downes/Payne albums.

Next, &quot;Arena&quot;, released in February 1996, featured Downes, Payne, Sturgis, Ibrahim and guest guitarist Elliott Randall (ex-Steely Dan, and Randy Crawford). The album was released on Resurgence Records but there was no tour because of lack of interest. The group&#x27;s lone promotional performance in conjunction with the album occurred on 19 April 1996, when Downes and Payne appeared with guitarist Elliott Randall on the Virgin FM radio programme &quot;Alive in London&quot; to play the song &quot;Never&quot;.

An all-acoustic album, &quot;Live Acoustic&quot;, was recorded by the group at Stadthalle, Bruchsal, Germany on 21 September 1997 (and released in December 1999) that featured a lineup of Downes, Payne, Ibrahim, and drummer Bob Richards. Also in 1997, a best of album &quot;Anthology&quot;, featuring songs from the past six albums was released. However, a lawsuit from Wetton meant that songs from the first three albums needed to be re-recorded.

In 1999, there was talk of a reunion of the original lineup minus Howe. The original proposition included Dave Kilminster on guitar, who had previously toured and recorded with Wetton. While Howe was interested in participating, he was unable to because of his busy schedule with Yes. This reunion did not take place and John Payne continued to carry on Asia with Downes uninterrupted. Wetton and Palmer did, however, get together to form Qango, which included Kilminster and John Young, although the band was short-lived. Kilminster went on to work with Keith Emerson, The Nice and Roger Waters.

Also in 1999, &quot;Rare&quot;, Asia&#x27;s seventh studio album, was released on Resurgence. It was made up of instrumental music which Downes and Payne had composed for the soundtrack for David Attenborough&#x27;s documentary nature film &quot;Salmon: Against the Tides&quot; (tracks 1–16) and for an unreleased CD-ROM video game (tracks 17–22).

In 2000 Geffen/Universal released a best-of entitled &quot;The Very Best of Asia: Heat of the Moment (1982–1990)&quot;, which also included three rare B-sides from the early days.
2001&#x27;s &quot;Aura&quot; featured three different session guitarists, including Ian Crichton (of Canadian progressive rock band Saga) who had briefly joined Asia in 1998–1999. &quot;Aura&quot; took a more progressive rock form, but still did not recapture the commercial success of the first album. Former members Howe, Thrall, Sturgis and Elliott Randall also made guest appearances. The single &quot;Ready to Go Home&quot; was barely distributed. Asia then signed with Recognition Records. 2001 did see the band with a stable lineup, achieved during the &quot;Aura&quot; sessions featuring Downes, Payne, guitarist Guthrie Govan and ex-Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band/The Firm/Uriah Heep/Gary Numan/AC/DC drummer Chris Slade (who had first joined Asia in 1999, briefly).

In 2001 and 2002, Asia toured for the first time since 1994, including their first United States dates since 1993. A live album and DVD, both titled &quot;America: Live in the USA&quot;, were released in 2003, recorded at the Classic Rock Productions Classic Rock Festival at The Patriots Theater at the Trenton War Memorial in Trenton, New Jersey on 5 October 2002, which they co-headlined with Uriah Heep.

In the summer of 2003, Downes and Payne undertook the &quot;Asia Across America Tour&quot;, which received some media attention. Performing &quot;unplugged&quot;, the duo would reportedly play anywhere in the United States that fans requested, provided there was a venue and the fans put up $3,000 to cover costs.

Marking a departure from convention, for the first time a studio release was not titled as a single word starting and ending with the letter A (excepting the partial compilation / partial new album &quot;Then &amp; Now&quot;). Released on Asia&#x27;s newly signed label SPV/Inside Out Records, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Silent Nation&quot; (the name being influenced by the Howard Stern vs. FCC incident) picked up some unexpected exposure on the Internet.

In 2004 an acoustic Asia toured once again featuring only Downes and Payne. In 2005 the full band toured in Europe and the Americas playing settings ranging from small clubs to medium-sized theatres. In the United States attendance was poor at best.

In August 2005 Slade left Asia to be replaced by drummer Jay Schellen. The new band started work on an album, tentatively entitled &quot;Architect of Time&quot;, which was originally planned for release early in 2006, though subsequent developments would cause this project to be shelved. Half of this material ended up being released on the album &quot;Window to the Soul&quot; in August 2006 under the new band name of GPS, which was an acronym for the three players involved: Govan, Payne and Schellen. After this, the three continued on as Asia Featuring John Payne in 2007.

Meanwhile, Wetton and Downes had released some archival Asia material under the name &quot;Wetton/Downes&quot; in September 2002 and they then reunited to record a full-length album (&quot;Icon&quot;, released in August 2005) and an accompanying EP and DVD. Two additional Icon projects have since followed: &quot;Icon II: Rubicon&quot; (November 2006) and &quot;Icon 3&quot; (March 2009).

===2006–2013: &quot;Original Asia&quot; reunion===

In early 2006, Downes left for a reunion of the original band lineup under the Asia name, a breakup that Payne described as &quot;painful&quot;. The existing lineup (minus Downes) continued for a short while before morphing into the aforementioned GPS.

Following Downes&#x27; departure, on 9 May 2006, John Payne, Geoff Downes, John Wetton, Carl Palmer and Steve Howe contractually agreed that Payne could continue his 15-year period with Asia as Asia Featuring John Payne. Asia featuring John Payne debuted in 2007 with Payne on vocals/bass, Guthrie Govan on guitar, Erik Norlander on keyboards and Jay Schellen on drums. Downes, Wetton, Palmer and Howe continued to perform and record as Asia thereafter.

The official websites of each band reflect a split between the shared history of Payne&#x27;s tenure with the band, as the reunited Asia acknowledge only pre- and post-Payne albums, whereas Asia Featuring John Payne claim Payne-era (1991–2006) albums &quot;Aqua&quot; (1992) through &quot;Silent Nation&quot; (2004) as part of their own discography. Asia Featuring John Payne perform songs from before and during Payne&#x27;s time in Asia.

Downes and the other three original members (Wetton, Palmer and Howe) convened a group meeting in England in early 2006 in anticipation of formally reforming for work that year. And after a slew of rumours, they announced that this original lineup of Asia were planning a CD, DVD and world tour to celebrate the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary. The band appeared in October 2006 on US cable channel VH-1 Classic and began a world tour largely focused on the United States. The band secured ownership of the Asia name and toured under the description of &quot;The Four Original Members of Asia&quot;. The set list featured most of the first album as well as a couple of songs from the second, along with one selection each from Yes, ELP, King Crimson and the Buggles to acknowledge the history of each member of the band. In a 2006 interview, guitarist Steve Howe stated, &quot;This is the real Asia. There have been other incarnations of the band, but this is the one that the public truly embraced&quot;.
The tour began on 29 August 2006 in Rochester, New York. &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot; was released by Geffen/Universal to tie into the tour in September and peaked at No. 183 on the United States album charts, the first time Asia had made the charts since 1990. A limited edition release available only at Best Buy stores also included a DVD of all the band&#x27;s music videos.

The reunion tour continued into 2007 with venue size based on the success of the 2006 shows, where the band was mainly playing in clubs and theatres. Many of these sold out, including all seven dates in Japan. Also in 2007, the band released &quot;Fantasia: Live In Tokyo&quot; on CD and DVD through Eagle Records, commemorating the 25th anniversary and documenting the success of the 2006–2007 tour.

In mid-2007, all four original members (Wetton, Downes, Howe and Palmer) went into the studio to record a new album, marking the first recorded material from all four original members since 1983&#x27;s &quot;Alpha&quot;. The band continued to tour until major heart surgery for Wetton in the second half of the year saw remaining tour dates rescheduled for 2008.

The new studio album, entitled &quot;Phoenix&quot;, was released on Frontiers Records on 14 April 2008 (via EMI/Capitol on 15 April in North America), along with a world tour to promote. The 12-track album includes &quot;An Extraordinary Life&quot;, based on Wetton&#x27;s experience of ill health; rockers such as &quot;Never Again&quot; and &quot;Alibis&quot;; and power ballads such as &quot;Heroine&quot; and &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;. The world tour also featured a couple of the new songs. The album cover featured Roger Dean&#x27;s illustration and design. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; album did well in both the American and European/Japanese markets. It debuted at No. 73 on the American Billboard 200; the band had not charted with a studio album since 1985.

As a special finale to the US &quot;Phoenix&quot; tour, the band performed, for the first time ever, the entire first Asia album from beginning to end at their San Francisco concert at The Regency Center on 5 May. The album comprised the entire second set of the evening&#x27;s concert.

In summer 2009, Asia toured the United States with Yes. Asia opened with a 55-minute show, while Yes closed with a 1-hour and 50-minute set. Asia&#x27;s set included only &quot;An Extraordinary Life&quot; from &quot;Phoenix&quot;, the rest of the songs coming from the first two albums plus one cover each from The Buggles (&quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; with Wetton on lead vocals and Downes on vocoder), King Crimson (&quot;The Court of the Crimson King&quot;, which was recorded by the original incarnation of that band with Greg Lake on lead vocals) and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer (&quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot;). Yes songs were omitted from this tour&#x27;s setlist, though Asia also covered &quot;Roundabout&quot; on earlier legs of the &quot;Four Original Members&quot; tour. Contrary to some early expectations, Downes did not perform with Yes, although their set list included two songs from the 1980 album &quot;Drama&quot;, which featured Downes on keys. A series of shows late in the tour featured a special appearance by Ian McDonald (flute and vocals on &quot;The Court Of The Crimson King&quot;, which he co-wrote, and backing vocals on &quot;Heat Of The Moment&quot;).

In late 2009, the band began working on their follow-up CD to &quot;Phoenix&quot;. According to Wetton&#x27;s website in late November 2009: &quot;Good news is that the new album is starting to leap, rather than creep (or sleep) in terms of progress. This week I have two completed lead vocals, with complete harmony/chorus voxes on three. It&#x27;s just me, Geoff [Downes], Steve R[ispin], and Mike Paxman in the studio--- Carl [Palmer] is pretty much all done, Steve H[owe] is half done, and returns to the fold after Yes tour. It sounds absolutely wonderful&quot;. The follow-up, titled &quot;Omega&quot;, was released in the UK on 26 April 2010.

The band finished a new studio album timed to coincide with the band&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary, titled &quot;XXX&quot;, and released in the UK on 2 July 2012 and worldwide around the same time. In September 2012 they played four shows in Japan and a North American tour started on 11 October 2012. The UK tour, however, had to be cancelled after a number of shows due to Palmer contracting a serious case of E. coli.

===2013–2017: Howe&#x27;s retirement, &quot;Gravitas&quot; and hiatus===
On 10 January 2013, Steve Howe announced his retirement from the band to focus on other projects, including Yes, bringing an end to the reunion of the original lineup. Asia in turn announced they would be continuing with new guitarist Sam Coulson, with a new album in the works entitled &quot;Gravitas&quot;. The new lineup performed live in 2013.

On the website ultimateclassicrock.com, Howe explained his decision to leave Asia:

The band finished the recording sessions for &quot;Gravitas&quot; in December 2013 and in January 2014 they started shooting the music video for &quot;Valkyrie&quot;, which was released as a single. The album&#x27;s cover artwork was designed by Asia longtime collaborator Roger Dean. On 30 January 2014, Wetton revealed the album&#x27;s track listing through Asia&#x27;s official website and talked about each song from the album. The album was released on 24 March 2014 and reached Number 1 in the Progressive Rock Chart for emusic on 27 March.

Following &quot;Gravitas&quot; and the subsequent tour, the band went on an almost three-year hiatus due to Wetton having cancer and undergoing chemotherapy. On 5 December 2016, Asia announced a US tour opening for American rock band Journey, beginning with twelve dates from 15 March 2017 at the Yakima Valley Sundome in Yakima, Washington, and four days later, announced their live album &quot;Symfonia: Live in Bulgaria 2013&quot;, which they performed with the Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra.

===2017–2018: Wetton&#x27;s death and tour with Journey===
On 11 January 2017, Wetton released a statement that, due to receiving another round of chemotherapy, he would be unable to perform on the dates announced for the Journey tour, and that he would be substituted by Billy Sherwood, one of Downes&#x27; Yes bandmates, and Wetton&#x27;s own co-writer and producer of the album &quot;Raised in Captivity&quot;. The band originally wanted to cancel the tour altogether, but Journey&#x27;s management and agents refused, forcing them to pick Sherwood as a last-minute replacement.

Wetton died on 31 January 2017 at the age of 67; Palmer later stated &quot;So, we used Billy and we had a phenomenal time. It was a great experience all &#x27;round, and I&#x27;m pleased we did it. John would have loved to be on that tour, so I&#x27;m pleased we did it for him, anyway.&quot; On 17 June 2017 Asia performed a show in homage to Wetton, titled &quot;An Extraordinary Life&quot;. The show was an interactive celebration of Wetton&#x27;s music and life. Fan dedications were sent into management and shown on a large projection screen above the stage.

After Wetton&#x27;s death, Downes stated that the duo had been working on another Asia album and stated that he hopes to eventually finish and release it as a final testament to Wetton. It is unclear whether Wetton had recorded any parts, or if the album had only been in the songwriting process. In August 2017, Palmer stated that there were no immediate plans for Asia to continue, as it was too soon to make any decisions and the band members would be busy on other projects in the meantime.

===2019–present: Lineup changes, tour with Yes, and 40th Anniversary Tour===

On 2 April 2019, the band announced it would join Yes, John Lodge, and Carl Palmer&#x27;s ELP Legacy as part of The Royal Affair Tour, a 26-date Summer 2019 North American joint tour, with Steve Howe joining the band for a portion of the set. The band also confirmed that Sam Coulson had amicably left Asia to focus on solo projects and that he would be replaced as guitarist on the tour by Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal, who also took over lead vocals, with Sherwood remaining on bass but moving to backing vocals. Coulson confirmed his departure on Twitter the same day.

In 2019, a &quot;New York Times&quot; investigation revealed that Asia was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. While Universal Music has generally disputed the severity of the fire&#x27;s damage, they have yet to publicly confirm or deny the status of Asia&#x27;s masters, while Downes has stated that he has it &quot;on good authority&quot; that the masters survived.

In 2022, Asia announced a 40th Anniversary Tour, with Marc Bonilla on guitar and vocals. However, the tour was later cancelled due to Alan Parsons, the band&#x27;s opening act, backing out in order to undergo surgery. Following the cancellation, Palmer said in February 2023 that there were no plans for any activity for the rest of the year.

The band are touring the US in summer 2024. Carl Palmer announced that he would not be on the tour, although he said &quot;I plan to eventually embrace the music of ASIA again at some point in the future.&quot; The tour sees a new line-up of Geoff Downes (keys), Virgil Donati (drums), John Mitchell (guitar) and Harry Whitley (bass, vocals).

==Personnel==

Throughout the years, Geoff Downes has been the longest serving member of the band and is the only one to appear on every studio album. However, he was out of the band from its 1989 reunion to 1990 due to prior commitments at the time.

The original lineup initially lasted from 1981 until 1983 when John Wetton left. It was reunited on two occasions: first, one year later when Wetton rejoined, but Steve Howe left before the band could work together again, and a second time in 2006, when Downes, the last original member in the band, replaced the rest of the band with his original bandmates. This last original reunion lasted until 2013, when Howe left once again. Wetton died from cancer in 2017, making another reunion of the original lineup impossible.

Several musicians have joined and left after a short time without recording any studio material with the group. The most notable collaboration of this kind was the participation of Greg Lake in the &quot;Asia in Asia&quot; concert on bass guitar and lead vocals. Yet more musicians have played as session musicians or have guested with the band without formally joining. Some of these artists include: Robert Fleischman, Vinnie Colaiuta, Francis Dunnery, Ant Glynne, Scott Gorham, Tomoyasu Hotei, Luís Jardim, Ron Komie, Tony Levin, Steve Lukather, Thomas Lang, Kim Nielsen-Parsons, Nigel Glockler, Simon Phillips, and Alex Thomas.

<text>Øresund or Öresund (, ; ; ), commonly known in English as the Sound, is a strait which forms the Danish–Swedish border, separating Zealand (Denmark) from Scania (Sweden). The strait has a length of ; its width varies from to . The narrowest point is between Helsingør in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden.

Øresund, along with the Great Belt, the Little Belt and the Kiel Canal, is one of four waterways that connect the Baltic Sea to the Atlantic Ocean via Kattegat, Skagerrak, and the North Sea; this makes it one of the busiest waterways in the world.

The Øresund Bridge, between the Danish capital Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malmö, inaugurated on 1 July 2000, connects a bi-national metropolitan area with close to 4 million inhabitants. The HH Ferry route, between Helsingør, Denmark and Helsingborg, Sweden, in the northern part of Øresund, is one of the world&#x27;s busiest international ferry routes, with more than 70 departures from each harbour per day.

Øresund is a geologically young strait that formed 8,500–8,000 years ago as a result of rising sea levels. Previously, the Ancylus Lake, a fresh-water body occupying the Baltic basin, had been connected to the sea solely via the Great Belt. The incursion of salt water via Øresund marked the beginning of the modern Baltic Sea as a salt-water body.

==Name==
The strait is called &quot;Øresund&quot; in Danish (and Norwegian), and &quot;Öresund&quot; in Swedish, informally &quot;Sundet&quot; (lit. &quot;the Strait&quot;) in all three languages.
The first part of the name is &quot;øre&quot; &quot;gravel/sand beach&quot;, and the second part is &quot;sund&quot;, i.e. &quot;sound, strait&quot;.

The name is first attested on a runestone dated to ca. AD 1000, where it is written as &quot;ura suti&quot;, read as Old East Norse (the dative case). 
The Old West Norse (and modern Icelandic) form of the name is &quot;Eyrarsund&quot;. 
&quot;Ør&quot; is the modern form of the old Norse word (aur) meaning a gravel beach or shoal (see also ayre), often forming a spit. Such landforms are common in the area and &quot;ör&quot; is found in the names of many places along the strait, e.g. Helsingør, Skanör, Dragør and Halör, an important center of trade during the Viking Age.

== Boundaries ==
The northern boundary between Øresund and Kattegat is a line which goes from Gilleleje at Zealand&#x27;s northern peak to the westernmost point of Kullaberg (Kullen&#x27;s Lighthouse) at the smaller peninsula north of Helsingborg, known as Kullahalvön. In the south, the boundary towards the Baltic Sea starts at Stevns Klint, at the westernmost peak of the peninsula just south of Køge Bay, Stevns Peninsula to Falsterbo at the Falsterbo peninsula. 
Its eastern boundary is the Swedish coastline; to the west Amager may be considered part of Øresund (in which case it is the largest island) or a part of Zealand. Amager has eight connections with Zealand (two street bridges, a road bridge, a motorway bridge, a dual-track railway tunnel, an underground metro and a bicycle bridge) as well as a combined motorway and dual track railway to Scania and Sweden.

==Streams, animals and salinity==
Øresund, like other Danish and Danish-German straits, is at the border between oceanic salt water (which has a salinity of more than 30 PSU or per mille by weight) and the far less salty Baltic Sea.

As the Kattegat in the north has almost oceanic conditions and the Baltic Sea (around 7 PSU, in its main basin) has brackish water, Øresund&#x27;s water conditions are rather unusual and shifting. The streams are very complex, but the surface stream is often northbound (from the Baltic Sea) which gives a lower surface salinity, though streams can change from one day to another. The average surface salinity is about 10–12 PSU in the southern part, but above 20 PSU north of Helsingør.

Near the seafloor (where the sea is deep enough), conditions are more stable and salinity is always oceanic (above 30 PSU) below a certain depth that varies between 10 and 15 metres. In the southern part, however, the depth is 5–6 metres (outside the rather narrow waterways Drogden and Flintrännan), and this is the definite border of oceanic salt water, therefore also a border for many maritime species of animals. Only 52 known salt-water species reside in the central Baltic Sea, compared to around 1500 in the North Sea. Close to 600 species are known to exist in at least some part of Øresund. Well-known examples, for which the bottom salinity makes a distinct breeding border, include lobster, small crabs (&quot;Carcinus maenas&quot;), several species of flatfish and the lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish; the latter can sometimes drift into the southwest Baltic Sea, but it cannot reproduce there.

There are daily tides, but the lunar attraction cannot force much water to move from west to east, or vice versa, in narrow waters where the current is either northbound or southbound. So, not much of the difference in water levels in Øresund is due to daily tides, and other circumstances &quot;hide&quot; the little tide that still remains. The current has a much stronger effect than the tide on the water level, but strong winds may also affect the water level. During exceptional conditions, such as storms and hurricanes, oceanic water may suddenly flow into the Baltic Sea at all depths. Such events give deep waters in the southern Baltic Sea higher salinity, which makes it possible for cod to breed there. If no such inflow of oceanic water to the Baltic Sea occurs for around a decade, the breeding of cod becomes endangered.


==History==
Political control of Øresund has been an important issue in Danish and Swedish history. Denmark maintained military control with the coastal fortress of Kronborg at Elsinore on the west side and Kärnan at Helsingborg on the east, until the eastern shore was ceded to Sweden in 1658, based on the Treaty of Roskilde. Both fortresses are located where the strait is 4 kilometres wide.

In 1429, King Eric of Pomerania introduced the Sound Dues which remained in effect for more than four centuries, until 1857. Transitory dues on the use of waterways, roads, bridges and crossings were then an accepted way of taxing which could constitute a great part of a state&#x27;s income. 
The Strait Dues remained the most important source of income for the Danish Crown for several centuries, thus making Danish kings relatively independent of Denmark&#x27;s privy council and aristocracy.

To be independent of the Øresund, Sweden carried out two great projects: the foundation of Gothenburg in 1621 and the construction of the Göta Canal from 1810 to 1832.

The Copenhagen Convention of 1857 abolished the Dues and made the Danish straits an international waterway.

A fixed connection was opened across the strait in 2000, the Øresund Bridge.

<text>Francisco Pizarro, Marquess of the Atabillos (; ;  – 26 June 1541) was a Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot;, best known for his expeditions that led to the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire.

Born in Trujillo, Spain, to a poor family, Pizarro chose to pursue fortune and adventure in the New World. He went to the Gulf of Urabá, and accompanied Vasco Núñez de Balboa in his crossing of the Isthmus of Panama, where they became the first Europeans to see the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. He served as mayor of the newly founded Panama City for a few years and undertook two failed expeditions to Peru. In 1529, Pizarro obtained permission from the Spanish crown to lead a campaign to conquer Peru and went on his third, and successful, expedition.

When local people who lived along the coast resisted this invasion, Pizarro moved inland and founded the first Spanish settlement in Peru, San Miguel de Piura. After a series of manoeuvres, Pizarro captured the Inca emperor Atahualpa at the Battle of Cajamarca in November 1532. A ransom for the emperor&#x27;s release was demanded and Atahualpa filled a room with gold, but Pizarro charged him with various crimes and executed him in July 1533. The same year, Pizarro entered the Inca capital of Cuzco and completed his conquest of Peru. In January 1535, he founded the city of Lima. Pizarro eventually fell victim to political power struggles and was assassinated in 1541.

== Early life ==
Francisco Pizarro was born in Trujillo, Cáceres, Spain (then in the Crown of Castile) in modern-day Extremadura, Spain. He was the illegitimate son of infantry colonel Gonzalo Pizarro (1446–1522) and Francisca González, a woman of poor means. His date of birth is uncertain, but it is believed to be sometime in the 1470s, probably 1475. Little attention was paid to his education and he grew up illiterate.

His father served in Navarre and in the Italian campaigns under Córdoba. His mother married late in life and had a son Francisco Martín de Alcántara, who was at the conquest of Peru with his half-brother from its inception. Through his father, Francisco was a second cousin, once removed, of Hernán Cortés.

==Early career as &quot;Conquistador&quot;==
On 10 November 1509, Pizarro sailed from Spain to the New World with Alonso de Ojeda on an expedition to Urabá. Pizarro became a participant in Ojeda&#x27;s failed colony, commanding the remnants until he abandoned it with the survivors. He sailed to Cartagena and joined the fleet of Martín Fernández de Enciso and, in 1513, accompanied Balboa in his crossing of the Isthmus of Panama to the Pacific. The following year, Pedro Arias Dávila became the newly appointed governor of Castilla de Oro and succeeded Balboa. During the next five years, Pizarro became a close associate of Dávila and the governor assigned him a &quot;repartimiento&quot; of natives and cattle. When Dávila decided to get rid of Balboa out of distrust, he instructed Pizarro to personally arrest him and bring him to stand trial. Balboa was beheaded in January 1519. For his loyalty to Dávila, Pizarro was rewarded with the positions of mayor (Alcalde) and magistrate of the then recently founded Panama City from 1519 to 1523.

==Expeditions to South America==

The first attempt to explore western South America was undertaken in 1522 by Pascual de Andagoya. The native South Americans he encountered told him about a gold-rich territory called Virú, which was on a river called Pirú (later evolving to Perú). These reports were relayed by the Spanish-Inca &quot;mestizo&quot; writer Garcilaso de la Vega in &quot;Comentarios Reales de los Incas&quot; (1608).

Andagoya eventually established contact with several Native American &quot;curacas&quot; (chiefs), some of whom he later claimed were sorcerers and witches. Having reached as far as the San Juan River (part of the present boundary between Ecuador and Colombia) Andagoya fell ill and returned to Panama. He spread the news and stories about &quot;Pirú&quot; – a great land to the south rich with gold (the legendary El Dorado). These revelations, along with the accounts for Cortés&#x27; success in Mexico, caught the attention of Pizarro, prompting a series of expeditions to the south.

In 1524, while still in Panama, Pizarro formed a partnership with a priest, Hernando de Luque and a soldier, Diego de Almagro, to explore and conquer the South. Pizarro, Almagro and Luque later explicitly renewed their compact, agreeing to conquer and divide equally among themselves the empire they hoped to vanquish. While their accord was strictly oral, they dubbed their enterprise the &quot;Empresa del Levante&quot; and determined that Pizarro would command the expedition, Almagro would provide military and food supplies and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.

===First expedition (1524)===
In November 1524, the first of three expeditions left Panama for the conquest of Peru with about 80 men and 4 horses. Juan de Salcedo was the standard bearer, Nicolás de Ribera was the treasurer and Juan Carvallo was the inspector.

Diego de Almagro was left behind because he was to recruit men, gather additional supplies and join Pizarro later. The Governor of Panama, Pedro Arias Dávila, at first approved in principle the exploration of South America. Pizarro&#x27;s first expedition, however, turned out to be a failure as his conquistadors, sailing down the Pacific coast, reached no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, lack of food and skirmishes with hostile natives, one of which caused Almagro to lose an eye by arrow-shot. The place names the Spanish bestowed along their route, including &quot;Puerto Deseado&quot; (desired port), &quot;Puerto del Hambre&quot; (port of hunger) and &quot;Punta Quemado&quot; or &quot;Puebla Quemado&quot; (burned port), confirmed their difficulties. Fearing subsequent hostile encounters like the one the expedition endured at the Battle of Punta Quemada, Pizarro ended his first expedition and returned to Panama.

===Second expedition (1526)===
Two years later Pizarro, Almagro and Luque started the arrangements for a second expedition with permission from Pedrarias Dávila, Panama&#x27;s governor. Dávila, who himself was preparing an expedition north to Nicaragua, was reluctant to permit another expedition, having lost confidence in Pizarro. The three associates eventually won his trust and he acquiesced. By this time, a new governor was to arrive and succeed Dávila. Pedro de los Ríos took charge as the new colonial administrator in July 1526 and initially approved Pizarro&#x27;s expeditions (he would join him several years later in Peru).

On 10 March 1526, Pizarro left Panama with two ships with 160 men and several horses, reaching as far as the Colombian San Juan River. Soon after arriving the party separated, with Pizarro staying to explore the new and often perilous territory off the swampy Colombian coasts, while the expedition&#x27;s co-commander, Almagro, returned to Panama for reinforcements. Pizarro&#x27;s &quot;Piloto Mayor&quot; (main pilot), Bartolomé Ruiz, continued sailing south and, after crossing the equator, found and captured a &quot;balsa&quot; (raft) under sail, with natives from Tumbes. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, these carried textiles, ceramic objects and some pieces of gold, silver and emeralds, making Ruiz&#x27;s findings the central focus of this second expedition. Some natives were taken aboard Ruiz&#x27;s ship to serve as interpreters.

He then set sail north for the San Juan River, arriving to find Pizarro and his men exhausted from the difficulties they had faced exploring the new territory. Soon Almagro sailed into the port laden with supplies and a reinforcement of at least eighty recruits who had arrived at Panama from Spain with an expeditionary spirit. The findings and excellent news from Ruiz along with Almagro&#x27;s new reinforcements cheered Pizarro and his tired followers. They decided to sail back to the territory already explored by Ruiz and, after a difficult voyage due to strong winds and currents, reached Atacames on the Ecuadorian coast. Here, they found a large native population recently brought under Inca rule. Unfortunately for the &quot;conquistadores&quot;, the people they encountered seemed so defiant and numerous that the Spanish decided not to enter the land.

====The Famous Thirteen====
After much wrangling between Pizarro and Almagro, it was decided that Pizarro would stay at a safer place, the Isla de Gallo, near the coast, while Almagro would return to Panama with Luque for more reinforcements – this time with proof of the gold they had found and the news of the discovery of the obviously wealthy land they had explored. The new governor of Panama, Pedro de los Ríos, had learned of the mishaps of Pizarro&#x27;s expeditions and the deaths of various settlers who had gone with him. Fearing an unsuccessful outcome, he rejected Almagro&#x27;s application for continued resources. In addition, he ordered two ships commanded by Juan Tafur to be sent immediately with the intention of bringing Pizarro and his crew back to Panama.

Pizarro had no intention of returning and when Tafur arrived at Isla de Gallo, Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: &quot;There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian. For my part, I go to the south.&quot;

Only 13 men stayed with Pizarro. They later became known as &quot;The Famous Thirteen&quot; (&quot;Los trece de la fama&quot;), while the rest of the expeditioners stayed with Tafur. Ruiz left in one of the ships with the intention of joining Almagro and Luque in their efforts to gather reinforcements. Soon after the ships left, Pizarro and his men constructed a crude boat and journeyed 25 leagues north to La Isla Gorgona, where they would remain for seven months before the arrival of new provisions.

Back in Panama, Pedro de los Ríos (after much convincing by Luque) had finally acquiesced to the requests for another ship, but only to bring Pizarro back within six months and completely abandon the expedition. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity and left Panama (this time without new recruits) for La Isla Gorgona to once again join Pizarro. On meeting with Pizarro, the associates decided to continue sailing south on the recommendations of Ruiz&#x27;s Indian interpreters.

By April 1528, they finally reached the northwestern Peruvian Tumbes Region. Tumbes became the first success the Spanish had so long desired. They were received with a warm welcome of hospitality and provisions from the Tumpis, the local inhabitants. On subsequent days two of Pizarro&#x27;s men, Alonso de Molina and Pedro de Candia, reconnoitred the territory and both, on separate accounts, reported back the riches of the land, including the decorations of silver and gold around the chief&#x27;s residence and the hospitable attentions with which they were received by everyone. The Spanish also saw for the first time the Peruvian llama, which Pizarro called &quot;little camels&quot;. Pizarro continued receiving the same accounts of a powerful monarch who ruled over the land they were exploring. These events served as evidence to convince the expedition that the wealth and power displayed at Tumbes were an example of the riches of the Peruvian territory. The conquistadors decided to return to Panama to prepare the final expedition of conquest with more recruits and provisions. Before leaving, however, Pizarro and his followers sailed south along the coast to see if anything of interest could be found. Historian William H. Prescott recounts that after passing through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz and Trujillo (founded by Almagro years later), they finally reached for the first time the ninth degree of the southern latitude in South America.

On their return towards Panama, Pizarro briefly stopped at Tumbes, where two of his men had decided to stay to learn the customs and language of the natives. Pizarro was also given two Peruvian boys to learn Spanish, one of whom was later baptized as Felipillo and served as an important interpreter, the equivalent of Cortés&#x27; La Malinche of Mexico, and another called Martinillo. Their final stop was at La Isla Gorgona, where two of his ill men (one had died) had stayed. After at least 18 months away, Pizarro and his followers anchored off the coasts of Panama to prepare for the final expedition.

===Capitulación de Toledo===
When the new governor of Panama, Pedro de los Ríos, refused to allow for a third expedition to the south, the associates resolved for Pizarro to leave for Spain and appeal to the sovereign in person. Pizarro sailed from Panama for Spain in the spring of 1528, accompanied by Pedro de Candia, some natives and llamas, plus samples of fabric, gold and silver.

Pizarro reached Seville in early summer. King Charles I, who was at Toledo, had an interview with Pizarro and heard of his expeditions in South America. The conquistador described the territory as rich in gold and silver that he and his followers had bravely explored &quot;to extend the empire of Castile&quot;. The king, who was soon to leave for Italy, was impressed at his accounts and promised his support for the conquest of Peru. Queen Isabel, though, in the absence of the king, signed the &quot;Capitulación de Toledo&quot; on 6 July 1529, a license document that authorized Pizarro to proceed with the conquest of Peru. Pizarro was officially named the Governor, Captain general, &quot;Adelantado&quot; and &quot;Alguacil Mayor&quot;, of New Castile for the distance of 200 leagues along the newly discovered coast and invested with all authority and prerogatives, leaving his associates in secondary positions (a fact that later incensed Almagro and would lead to eventual discord). One of the grant conditions was that within six months, Pizarro should raise a sufficiently equipped force of 250 men, of whom 100 might be drawn from the colonies.

This gave Pizarro time to leave for his native Trujillo and convince his brother Hernando Pizarro and other close friends to join him on his third expedition. Francisco de Orellana joined the group and would later discover and explore the length of the Amazon River. Two half-brothers from his father, Juan Pizarro and Gonzalo Pizarro, and a half-brother from his mother, Francisco Martín de Alcántara, later also decided to join him, as well as his cousin Pedro Pizarro, who served as his page. When the expedition left the following year, it numbered three ships, 180 men and 27 horses.

Pizarro could not raise the number of men the Capitulación required and sailed clandestinely from the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda for the Canary Island of La Gomera in January 1530. He was there joined by his brother Hernando and the remaining men in two vessels that would sail back to Panama. Pizarro&#x27;s third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530.

===Conquest of Peru (1532)===
In 1531, Pizarro once again landed on the coasts near Ecuador, the province of Coaque and the region of &quot;esmeraldas&quot;, where some gold, silver and emeralds were procured and then dispatched to Almagro. The latter had stayed in Panama to gather more recruits. Sebastián de Belalcázar soon arrived with 30 men. Though Pizarro&#x27;s main objective was then to set sail and dock at Tumbes like his previous expedition, he was forced to confront the Punian natives in the Battle of Puná, leaving three or four Spaniards dead and many wounded. Soon after, Hernando de Soto, another conquistador who had joined the expedition, arrived with 100 volunteers and horses to aid Pizarro and with him sailed towards Tumbes, only to find the place deserted and destroyed. The two conquistadors expected that the settlers had disappeared or died under murky circumstances. The chiefs explained that the fierce tribes of Punians had attacked them and ransacked the place.

As Tumbes no longer afforded safe accommodations, Pizarro led an excursion into the interior in May 1532 and established the first Spanish settlement in Peru, San Miguel de Piura, and a &quot;repartimiento&quot;.

Leaving 50 men back at the settlement under the command of Antonio Navarro, Pizarro proceeded with his conquest accompanied by 200 men on 24 September 1532. After arriving at Zaran, de Soto was dispatched to a Peruvian garrison at Caxas. After a week, he returned with an envoy from the Inca himself, with presents and an invitation to visit the Inca ruler&#x27;s camp.

Following the defeat of his brother, Huáscar, in the Inca Civil War, Atahualpa had been resting in the Sierra of northern Peru, near Cajamarca, in the nearby thermal baths known today as the Inca Baths. Arriving at Cajamarca on 15 November 1532, Pizarro had a force of just 110-foot soldiers, 67 cavalry, three arquebuses and two falconets. He sent Hernando Pizarro and de Soto to meet with Atahualpa in his camp. Atahualpa agreed to meet Pizarro in his Cajamarca plaza fortress the next day. Fray Vincente de Valverde and native interpreter Felipillo approached Atahualpa in Cajamarca&#x27;s central plaza. After the Dominican friar expounded the &quot;true faith&quot; and the need to pay tribute to the Emperor Charles V, Atahualpa replied, &quot;I will be no man&#x27;s tributary.&quot; His complacency, because fewer than 200 Spanish remained, as opposed to his 50,000-man army, of which 6,000 accompanied him to Cajamarca, sealed his fate and that of the Inca empire.

Atahualpa&#x27;s refusal led Pizarro and his force to attack the Inca army in what became the Battle of Cajamarca on 16 November 1532. The Spanish were successful. Pizarro executed Atahualpa&#x27;s 12-man honor guard and took the Inca captive at the so-called Ransom Room. By February 1533, Almagro had joined Pizarro in Cajamarca with an additional 150 men and 50 horses.

Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room () with gold and two with silver, Atahualpa was convicted of 12 charges, including killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro and his forces. He was executed by garrote on 29 August 1533. Francisco Pizarro and de Soto were opposed to Atahualpa&#x27;s execution, but Francisco consented to the trial due to the &quot;great agitation among the soldiers&quot;, particularly by Almagro. De Soto was on a reconnaissance mission the day of the trial and execution and upon his return expressed his dismay, stating, &quot;he should have been taken to Castile and judged by the emperor.&quot; King Charles later wrote to Pizarro: &quot;We have been displeased by the death of Atahualpa, since he was a monarch and particularly as it was done in the name of justice.&quot;

Pizarro advanced with his army of 500 Spaniards toward Cuzco, accompanied by Chalcuchimac, one of the leading Inca generals of the north and a supporter of Atahualpa, who was subsequently burned at the stake. Manco Inca Yupanqui joined Pizarro after the death of Túpac Huallpa. During the exploration of Cuzco, Pizarro was impressed and through his officers wrote back to King Charles I of Spain, saying: &quot;This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies... We can assure your Majesty that it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.&quot;

The Spanish sealed the conquest of Peru by entering Cuzco on 15 November 1533. Jauja, in the fertile Mantaro Valley, was established as Peru&#x27;s provisional capital in April 1534, but it was high up in the mountains and too distant from the sea to serve as the capital. Pizarro founded the city of Lima on Peru&#x27;s central coast on 6 January 1535, which he considered to be one of the most important things he had created in life.

By early 1536, Manco Inka, supported by an army of perhaps 100,000 people, initiated a siege of Cuzco. At the same time, smaller Inca expeditionary forces moved to destroy other European strongholds. In the three years of continuous warfare since the arrival of Pizarro, Inca military leaders had become familiar with Spanish military tactics and developed effective counters. Perhaps the most effective of these military innovations was the one that dealt with the Europeans&#x27; greatest advantage on the battlefield: horses. Inca soldiers would offer battle but hold their position until the Spaniards had concentrated their cavalry in order to break the indigenous line. They would then fall back before the cavalry charge and draw the Europeans into a canyon where prepositioned forces could crush them under avalanches of rocks and missile weapons. Instead of charging the numerically inferior Europeans as they had done early on, Inca soldiers used their discipline and knowledge of the terrain in order to draw the armoured cavalry charge into a death trap. Well documented battlefield deaths show that many more Spaniards died in these battles than in the early days of the war when theoretically the Inca had a much greater advantage. Despite winning the majority of the battles, the inability of the Inca forces to overwhelm Cuzco&#x27;s fortifications, manned as they were by only 200 fighting men armed with gunpowder weapons, signalled the definitive victory of Spanish forces.

After the final effort of the Inca to recover Cuzco had been defeated by Almagro, a dispute occurred between Pizarro and Almagro respecting the limits of their jurisdiction, as both claimed the city of Cuzco. The king of Spain had awarded the Governorate of New Toledo to Almagro and the Governorate of New Castile to Pizarro. The dispute had originated from a disagreement on how to interpret the limit between the governorates. This led to confrontations between the Pizarro brothers and Almagro, who was eventually defeated during the Battle of Las Salinas (1538) and executed. Almagro&#x27;s son, also named Diego and known as &quot;El Mozo&quot;, was later stripped of his lands and left bankrupt by Pizarro.

Atahualpa&#x27;s wife, 10-year-old Cuxirimay Ocllo Yupanqui, was with Atahualpa&#x27;s army in Cajamarca and had stayed with him while he was imprisoned. Following his execution, she was taken to Cuzco, given the name Doña Angelina and made the concubine of Francisco Pizarro. By 1538, it was known she had borne Pizarro two sons, Juan and Francisco.

==Death==
In Lima, on 26 June 1541 &quot;a group of 20 heavily armed supporters of Diego de Almagro II &quot;el mozo&quot; stormed Pizarro&#x27;s palace, assassinating him and then forcing the terrified city council to appoint young Almagro as the new governor of Peru&quot;. &quot;Most of Pizarro&#x27;s guests fled, but a few fought the intruders, numbered variously between seven and 25. While Pizarro struggled to buckle on his breastplate, his defenders, including his half-brother Martín de Alcántara, were killed&quot;. For his part, Pizarro killed two attackers and ran through a third. A contemporary chronicler, Agustín de Zárate, wrote that Pizarro fought until &quot;he was too exhausted to brandish his sword&quot; and then was struck fatally in the throat. When he fell to the ground he reportedly drew a cross on the floor with his blood and kissed it before dying. A modern forensic examination of his remains indicated that Pizarro had been savagely attacked with multiple stab wounds to his head and neck as well as defensive wounds to his hands and arms.

Pizarro&#x27;s remains were briefly interred in the cathedral courtyard; at some later time, his head and body were separated and buried in separate boxes underneath the floor of the cathedral. In 1892, in preparation for the anniversary of Columbus&#x27; discovery of the Americas, a body believed to be that of Pizarro was exhumed and put on display in a glass coffin. However, in 1977, men working on the cathedral&#x27;s foundation discovered a lead box in a sealed niche, which bore the inscription: &quot;Here is the head of Marquess Don Francisco Pizarro who discovered and conquered the kingdoms of Peru and presented them to the crown of Castile.&quot; A team of forensic scientists from the United States, led by William R. Maples, was invited to examine the two bodies and they soon determined that the body which had been honored in the glass case for nearly a century had been incorrectly identified. The skull within the lead box not only bore the marks of multiple sword blows, but the features bore a remarkable resemblance to portraits made of the man in life.

==Legacy==


By his marriage to Quispe Sisa, Pizarro had a son also named Francisco, who married his relative Inés Pizarro, without issue. After Pizarro&#x27;s death, Inés Yupanqui, whom he took as a mistress, Inca princess and favourite sister of Atahualpa, who had been given to Francisco in marriage by her brother, married a Spanish cavalier named Ampuero and left for Spain, taking her daughter who would later be legitimized by imperial decree. Francisca Pizarro Yupanqui eventually married her uncle Hernando Pizarro in Spain, on 10 October 1537; the third son of Pizarro who was never legitimized, Francisco, by Dona Angelina, a wife of Atahualpa that he had taken as a mistress, died shortly after reaching Spain.

After his invasion, Pizarro destroyed the Inca state and while ruling the area for almost a decade, initiated the decline of local cultures. The Incas&#x27; polytheistic religion was replaced by Christianity and much of the local population was reduced to serfdom under the Spanish elite. The cities of the Inca Empire were transformed into Spanish Catholic cities. Pizarro is also reviled for ordering Atawallpa&#x27;s death despite the ransom payment (which Pizarro kept, after paying the Spanish king his due). Some Peruvians, particularly those of indigenous descent, may regard him negatively, although until relatively recently Pizarro had been portrayed positively, for instance in textbooks, for introducing Catholicism and creating a privileged class of mainly Spanish descent.

===Sculptures===
In the early 1930s, sculptor Ramsay MacDonald created three copies of an anonymous European foot soldier resembling a conquistador with a helmet, wielding a sword and riding a horse. The first copy was offered to Mexico to represent Cortés, though it was rejected. The statue was taken to Lima in 1934 and re-purposed to represent Pizarro. One other copy of the statue resides in Wisconsin. The mounted statue of Pizarro in the Plaza Mayor in Trujillo, Spain, was created by American sculptor Charles Rumsey. It was presented to the city by his widow in 1926.

The statue long stood an adjacent square to Peru&#x27;s Government Palace. In 2003, after years of requests for the statue to be removed, the mayor of Lima, Luis Castañeda Lossio, approved the transfer of the statue to another location. Since 2004, however, Pizarro&#x27;s statue has been in a park surrounded by the recently restored 17th-century walls in the Rímac District. The statue faces the Rímac River and the Government Palace.

===Palace of the Conquest===

After returning from Peru extremely wealthy, the Pizarro family erected a plateresque-style palace on the corner of the Plaza Mayor in Trujillo. Francisca Pizarro Yupanqui and her uncle/husband Hernando Pizarro ordered the building of the palace; it features busts of them and others. It instantly became a recognizable symbol of the plaza.

The opulent palace is structured in four stands, giving it the significance of the coat of arms of the Pizarro family, which is situated at one of its corner balconies displaying its iconographic content. The building&#x27;s decor includes plateresque ornaments and balustrades.
==In popular culture==

* &quot;Pizarro&quot; is the title and subject of a dramatic tragedy by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, presented in 1799. Sheridan based his work on the German tragedy by August von Kotzebue, &quot;Die Spanier in Peru&quot;.
* Pizarro is the main protagonist of the theatre play &quot;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&quot; and a film of the same name. Rather than an accurate depiction of historical events, its subject is Pizarro&#x27;s spirituality and personal relationship with Atahualpa. The film mostly stays true to the dialogue-based character of the play and a chamber setting while providing respected actors of the time (1969).
* Francisco Pizarro is depicted as a major supporting character in &quot;The Mysterious Cities of Gold&quot;, where he is obsessed with locating one of the seven lost cities of gold. In the English version of the series, the character of Pizarro is voiced by Maurice Podbrey.
* The novel &quot;Un puñado de gloria&quot; by Eduardo Sguiglia has Francisco Pizarro as one of the main protagonists and narrates his overthrow and fall.
* Pizarro is also the protagonist in the historical novel &quot;The Gold of Caxamalca&quot; by Jakob Wassermann.
* Pizarro is a character in &quot;Surya kandle Sona&quot; (The golden tears of the sun), a novella in Bengali, penned by Premendra Mitra. Pizarro is depicted as a scheming fortune-hunter who conquered Peru by dint of treachery and the ruthless application of the Machiavellian policy of putting expediency above morality. The protagonist of the story is Ghanaram (an ancestor of Ghanashyam Das, a teller of tall tales) who wages a heroic struggle against the Spanish conquistadors to emancipate Peru from the fetters of slavery but ultimately fails to fulfil his mission. (Source:&quot;Ghanada Samagra,volume 3,Ananda Publishers)
* Randall Garrett, known mainly as a science fiction writer, wrote the novelette &quot;Despoilers of the Golden Empire&quot;, whose language leads readers to believe they are reading a story about a space invasion in the far future, while in fact it describes Pizarro&#x27;s conquest of the Incas. As noted by Garrett, every word of the story is historically accurate, but it was written in a deliberately misleading way.

<text>Manchukuo, officially known as the State of Manchuria prior to 1934 and the Empire of Great Manchuria thereafter, was a puppet state of the Empire of Japan in Northeast China that existed from 1932 until its dissolution in 1945. It was ostensibly founded as a republic, its territory consisting of the lands seized in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria; it was later declared to be a constitutional monarchy in 1934, though very little changed in the actual functioning of government. Manchukuo received limited diplomatic recognition, mostly from states aligned with the Axis powers, with its existence widely seen as illegitimate.

The region now known as Manchuria had historically been the homeland of the Manchu people, though by the 20th century they had long since become a minority in the region, with Han Chinese constituting by far the largest ethnic group. The Manchu-led Qing dynasty, which had governed China since 17th century, was overthrown with the permanent abolition of the dynastic system in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, with Puyi, the final emperor of China, forced to abdicate at the age of six. In 1931, Manchuria was invaded and occupied by the Empire of Japan following the Mukden incident. A puppet government was set up the following year, with Puyi brought in by the Japanese to serve as its nominal regent, though he himself had no actual political power. Japanese officials ultimately made all pertinent decisions, and exercised total control over Puyi&#x27;s court and personal safety. Upon the nominal transition from republic to empire, Puyi was proclaimed as the emperor of Manchukuo.

The Japanese population of Manchuria increased dramatically during this period, largely due to Japan&#x27;s efforts to resettle young, land-poor farmers from the inner islands. By 1945, more than a million Japanese people had settled within Manchukuo. The region&#x27;s Korean population also increased during this period. Regions in the western part of the country with large Mongolian populations were ruled under a slightly different system, reflecting the distinct traditions extant there. The southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, now the city of Dalian, continued to be ruled directly by Japan as the Kwantung Leased Territory until the end of the war.

The state was ultimately toppled at the end of World War II with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945; its government was formally dissolved following the surrender of Japan in September. The territory was transferred to Chinese administration the following year.

==Names==

The name of the state is written with the same Han characters sharing the same meaning in both Japanese and Chinese, allowing for the use of the simplified and variant characters that exist in both languages. In Chinese, the name of Manchukuo has often been prefixed with to stress its perceived illegitimacy.

In English, &#x27;Manchukuo&#x27; derives from the Wade–Giles romanization , incorporating the anglicized demonym &#x27;Manchu&#x27;. Other European languages used equivalent terms: Manchukuo was known to its Axis allies as in Italian and or in German.

Manchukuo was often referred to in English simply as &#x27;Manchuria&#x27;, itself an unfamiliar term within China; its use had previously been widely encouraged by the Japanese in order to connote a level of separation from the rest of China. This was in stark contrast to the position held by the Qing, that Manchus were one of several integral Chinese peoples, with their homeland being an integral part of China. The historian Norman Smith wrote that &quot;the term &#x27;Manchuria&#x27; is controversial&quot;. Professor Mariko Asano Tamanoi remarked that she would &quot;use the term in quotation marks&quot;. Herbert Giles wrote that the name was unknown to the Manchu people themselves as a geographical designation. In 2012, Professor Chad D. Garcia noted that usage of the term was out of favor in &quot;current scholarly practice&quot;, instead preferring &quot;the northeast [of China]&quot;.

The name of the country was changed to the &#x27;Empire of Manchuria&#x27; in 1934 upon the coronation of Puyi as the Kangde Emperor. The name in Chinese and Japanese literally translates to &#x27;Empire of Great Manchuria&#x27;, with the prefixed suggestive of official names for previous Chinese dynasties, such as &#x27;Great Ming&#x27; and &#x27;Great Qing&#x27;, though this went largely unreflected in English translations.

== History ==
=== Background ===
The Qing dynasty was founded in the 17th century by Manchus hailing from northeastern China, conquering the ethnically Han Shun and Ming dynasties. Upon establishing themselves, the Qing referred to their state as in Chinese and equivalently as ; in Manchu. The name was used in official documents and treaties, and while conducting foreign affairs. The Qing equated the territory of their state, which among other regions included present-day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet, with the idea of &#x27;China&#x27; itself, rejecting notions that only Han areas were core parts of China. The Qing thought of China as fundamentally multi-ethnic: the term &#x27;Chinese people&#x27; referred to all the Han, Manchu and Mongol subjects within the empire; likewise, the term &#x27;Chinese language&#x27; was used to refer to the Manchu and Mongolian languages in addition to those language varieties that descended from Old Chinese. Moreover, the Qing stated explicitly in various edicts, as well as within the Treaty of Nerchinsk, that the Manchu home provinces belonged to China.

The Manchu homeland was referred to as the during the Qing, those provinces being Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning. These regions were first delineated in 1683, but would not become actual provinces until 1907. Jilin and Heilongjiang, considered primarily Manchu, were separated from Han Liaoning along the Willow Palisade, with internal movement and migration regulated by ethnicity. These policies continued until after the end of the Second Opium War in the late 19th century, when the government started to encourage massive waves of Han migration to the northeast, collectively known as the Chuang Guandong, in order to prevent the Russian Empire from seizing more of the area. In 1907, the three provinces constituting Manchuria were officially constituted, and the Viceroy of the Three Northeast Provinces position was established to govern them.

===Qing decline and rising nationalism===

As the power of the court in Beijing weakened, many of the empire&#x27;s outlying areas either broke free (such as Kashgar) or fell under the control of the Western imperialist powers. The Russian Empire had set its sights on Qing&#x27;s northern territories, and through unequal treaties signed in 1858 and 1860 ultimately annexed huge tracts of territory adjoining the Amur River outright, now known collectively as Outer Manchuria As the Qing continued to weaken, Russia made further efforts to take control of the rest of Manchuria. By the 1890s, the region was under strong Russian influence, symbolized by the Russian-built Chinese Eastern Railway that ran from Harbin to Vladivostok.

The Japanese ultra-nationalist Black Dragon Society initially supported Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s activities against the Qing state, hoping that an overthrow of the Qing would enable a Japanese takeover of the Manchu homeland, with the belief that Han Chinese would not oppose it. Tōyama Mitsuru, who was the Society&#x27;s leader as well as a member of the pan-Asian secret society Gen&#x27;yōsha, additionally believed that the anti-Qing revolutionaries would even aid the Japanese in taking over, as well as helping them to enlarge the opium trade that the Qing were currently trying to destroy. The Society would support Sun and other anti-Manchu revolutionaries until the Qing ultimately collapsed. In Japan, many anti-Qing revolutionaries gathered in exile, where they founded and operated the Tongmenghui resistance movement, whose first meeting was hosted by the Black Dragon Society. The Black Dragon Society had a large impact on Sun specifically, cultivating an intimate relationship with him. Sun often promoted pan-Asianism, and sometimes even passed himself off as Japanese. In the wake of the Xinhai Revolution, the Black Dragons began infiltrating China, making inroads selling opium and spreading anti-Communist sentiment. Eventually, they also began directly agitating for a Japanese takeover of Manchuria.

With the Russo-Japanese War, Japanese influence largely replaced that of Russia in Manchuria. Japan had mobilized one million soldiers to fight the Russians in Manchuria, one for every eight Japanese families. Despite shocking success, the Japanese military underwent heavy losses, ultimately incurring about 500,000 casualties. The war caused many Japanese people to develop a more possessive attitude towards Manchuria, with Japan having sacrificed so much while fighting in Manchurian territory. From 1905 on, Japanese publications often described Manchuria as a &quot;sacred&quot; and &quot;holy&quot; land where many Japanese had died as martyrs. The war had almost bankrupted Japan, forcing the Japanese to accept the compromise Treaty of Portsmouth mediated by President Theodore Roosevelt of the United States, under which Japan made gains, but nowhere to the extent that the Japanese public had been expecting. The Treaty of Portsmouth set off an anti-American riot in Tokyo between 5–7 September 1905 as the general viewpoint in Japan was that the Japanese had won the war but lost the peace. The perception in Japan was the Treaty of Portsmouth was a humiliating diplomatic disaster that did not place all of Manchuria into the Japanese sphere of influence as widely expected, and the question of Manchuria was still &quot;unfinished business&quot; that would one day be resolved by the Imperial Army. In 1906, Japan established the South Manchurian Railway on the southern half of the former Chinese Eastern Railway built by Russia from Manzhouli to Vladivostok via Harbin with a branch line from Harbin to Port Arthur, now known as Dalian.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Kwantung Army had the right to occupy southern Manchuria while the region fell into the Japanese economic sphere of influence. The Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railroad company had a market capitalization of 200 million yen, making it Asia&#x27;s largest corporation, which went beyond just running the former Russian railroad network in southern Manchuria to owning the ports, mines, hotels, telephone lines, and sundry other businesses, dominating the economy of Manchuria. With the growth of the South Manchuria Railroad company (&quot;Mantetsu&quot;) came a growth in number of Japanese people living in Manchuria, from a Japanese population of 16,612 in 1906 to one of 233,749 in 1930. The majority of blue-collar employees for &quot;Mantetsu&quot; were Chinese, and the Japanese employees were mostly white-collar, meaning most of the Japanese living in Manchuria were middle-class people who saw themselves as an elite. In Japan, Manchuria was widely seen as analogous to the Wild West: a dangerous frontier region full of bandits, revolutionaries, and warlords, but also a land of boundless wealth and promise, where it was possible for ordinary people to become very well-off. During the interwar period, Manchuria once again became a political and military battleground between Russia, Japan, and China. Imperial Japan moved into Russia&#x27;s far eastern territories, taking advantage of internal chaos following the Russian Revolution. However, in the years following the establishment of the Soviet Union, a combination of Soviet military successes and American economic pressure forced the Japanese to withdraw from the area, and Outer Manchuria would be under Soviet control by 1925.

=== Japanese invasion and establishment of Manchukuo ===

During the Warlord Era, Marshal Zhang Zuolin established himself in Manchuria with Japanese backing. Later, the Japanese Kwantung Army found him too independent, so he was assassinated in 1928. In assassinating Marshal Zhang, the &#x27;Old Marshal&#x27;, the Kwantung Army generals expected Manchuria to descend into anarchy, providing the pretext for seizing the region. Marshal Zhang was killed when the bridge his train was riding across was blown up while three Chinese men were murdered and explosive equipment was placed on their corpses to make it appear that they were the killers, but the plot was foiled when Zhang&#x27;s son Zhang Xueliang, the &#x27;Young Marshal&#x27;, succeeded him without incident while Tokyo refused to send additional troops to Manchuria. Given that the Kwantung Army had assassinated his father, the &quot;Young Marshal&quot;—who unlike his father was a Chinese nationalist—had strong reasons to dislike Japan&#x27;s privileged position in Manchuria. Marshal Zhang knew his forces were too weak to expel the Kwantung Army, but his relations with the Japanese were unfriendly right from the start.


After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, Japanese militarists moved forward to separate the region from Chinese control and to create a Japanese-aligned puppet state. To create an air of legitimacy, the last Emperor of China, Puyi, was invited to come with his followers and act as the head of state for Manchuria. One of his faithful companions was Zheng Xiaoxu, a Qing reformist and loyalist.

The &quot;Northeast Supreme Administrative Council&quot; was established as a Japanese puppet organization in Manchuria following the Mukden Incident. On 16 February 1932, the Imperial Army hosted the &quot;Founding Conference&quot; or &quot;Big Four Conference&quot; with Liaoning governor Zang Shiyi, Heilongjiang governor Zhang Jinghui, commander of the Kirin Provincial Army Xi Qia, and general Ma Zhanshan, in order to establish the Northeast Administrative Committee. On the committee&#x27;s second meeting, the aforementioned four plus Tang Yulin, Ling Sheng, and Qimote Semupilei were appointed as chairmen. On 18 February, the Council issued a statement announcing that &quot;the Northeast provinces are completely independent&quot;.

On 18 February 1932 Manchukuo was proclaimed by the Northeast Supreme Administrative Council nominally in control of the region. On February 25, the Council decided that the name of the new country name (Manchukuo), the national flag, era name, and more. Manchukuo was formally established on 1 March in Xinjing, and the council was abolished. It received formal recognition from Japan on 15 September 1932 through the Japan–Manchukuo Protocol, after the assassination of Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi. The city of Changchun—renamed —became the capital of Manchukuo. The local Chinese organized volunteer armies to oppose the Japanese and the new state required a war lasting several years to pacify the country.

===Nominal transition to monarchy===

Manchukuo was proclaimed a monarchy on 1 March 1934, with Puyi assuming the throne with the era name of Kangde. He was nominally assisted in his executive duties by a Privy Council and a General Affairs State Council. This State Council was the center of political power, and consisted of several cabinet ministers, each assisted by a Japanese vice-minister. The commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army also served as the official Japanese ambassador to the state. He functioned in a manner similar to resident officers in European colonial empires, with the added ability to veto decisions by the emperor. The Kwantung Army leadership placed Japanese vice ministers in his cabinet, while all Chinese advisors gradually resigned or were dismissed.

Zheng Xiaoxu served as Manchukuo&#x27;s first prime minister until 1935, when Zhang Jinghui succeeded him. Puyi was nothing more than a figurehead and real authority rested in the hands of the Japanese military officials. An imperial palace was specially built for the emperor. The Manchu ministers all served as frontmen for their Japanese vice-ministers, who made all decisions.

In this manner, Japan formally detached Manchukuo from China over the course of the 1930s. With Japanese investment and rich natural resources, the area became an industrial powerhouse. Manchukuo had its own issued banknotes and postage stamps. Several independent banks were founded as well.

The conquest of Manchuria proved to be extremely popular with the Japanese people who saw the conquest as providing a much-needed economic &quot;lifeline&quot; to their economy which had been badly hurt by the Great Depression. The very image of a &quot;lifeline&quot; suggested that Manchuria—which was rich in natural resources—was essential for Japan to recover from the Great Depression, which explains why the conquest was so popular at the time and later why the Japanese people were so completely hostile towards any suggestion of letting Manchuria go. At the time, censorship in Japan was nowhere near as stringent as it would later become, and the American historian Louise Young noted: &quot;Had they wished, it would have been possible in 1931 and 1932 for journalists and editors to express anti-war sentiments&quot;. The popularity of the conquest meant that newspapers such as the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; that had initially opposed the war swiftly pivoted to support the war as the best way of improving sales. The conquest of Manchuria was also presented as resolving the &quot;unfinished business&quot; left over the Russo-Japanese war that finally undid one of the key terms of the Treaty of Portsmouth. The most popular song in Japan in 1932 was the &quot;Manchuria March&quot; whose verses proclaimed that the seizing of Manchuria in 1931–32 was a continuation of what Japan had fought for against Russia in 1904–05, and the ghosts of the Japanese soldiers killed in the Russo-Japanese war could now rest at ease as their sacrifices had not been in vain.

In 1935, Manchukuo purchased the Chinese Eastern Railway from the Soviet Union.

=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===
During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese used Manchukuo as a base to conduct their invasion of the rest of China. The Manchu general Tong Linge was killed in action by the Japanese in the Battle of Beiping–Tianjin, which marked the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. In the summer of 1939, a border dispute between Manchukuo and the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic resulted in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. During this battle, a combined Soviet–Mongolian force defeated a Kwantung Army with limited Manchukuoan support.

=== Soviet invasion, dissolution, and aftermath ===
On 8 August 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, in accordance with the agreement at the Yalta Conference, and invaded Manchukuo from Outer Manchuria and Outer Mongolia. During the Soviet offensive, the Manchukuo Imperial Army, on paper a 200,000-man force, performed poorly and whole units surrendered to the Soviets without firing a single shot; there were even cases of armed riots and mutinies against the Japanese forces. Puyi abdicated on 17 August and had hoped to escape to Japan to surrender to the Americans, but the Soviets captured him and eventually extradited him to the government of China, when the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, where the authorities had him imprisoned on charges of war crimes, along with all other captured Manchukuo officials.

From 1945 to 1948, Manchuria served as a base of operations for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army against the National Revolutionary Army in the Chinese Civil War. The Chinese Communists used Manchuria as a staging ground until the final Nationalist retreat to Taiwan in 1949. Many Manchukuo army and Japanese Kantōgun personnel served with the communist troops during the Chinese Civil War against the Nationalist forces. Most of the 1.5 million Japanese who had been left in Manchukuo at the end of World War II were sent back to their homeland in 1946–1948 by U.S. Navy ships in the operation now known as the Japanese repatriation from Huludao.

== Politics ==

Historians generally consider Manchukuo a puppet state of Imperial Japan due to the Japanese military&#x27;s continued occupation of the country and its direct control over the government.

The Legislative Council was largely a ceremonial body, existing to rubber-stamp decisions issued by the State Council. The only authorized political party was the government-sponsored Concordia Association, although various émigré groups were permitted their own political associations such as the White Russian Russian Fascist Party.

The American historian Louise Young noted that one of the most striking aspects of Manchukuo was that many of the young Japanese civil servants who went to work in Manchukuo were on the left, or at least had once been. In the 1920s, much of the younger &quot;intelligentsia&quot; in Japan had rejected their parents&#x27; values and had become active in various left-wing movements. Starting with the Peace Preservation Law of 1925, which made the very act of thinking about &#x27;altering the &#x27; a crime, the government had embarked on a sustained campaign to stomp out all left-wing thought in Japan. However, many of the bright young university graduates active in left-wing movements in Japan were needed to serve as civil servants in Manchukuo, which Young noted led the Japanese state to embark upon a contradictory policy of recruiting the same people active in the movements that it was seeking to crush.&quot; To rule Manchukuo, which right from the start had a very statist economy, the Japanese state needed university graduates who were fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and the 1920s–30s, many of the university graduates in Japan who knew Mandarin were &quot;progressives&quot; involved in left-wing causes. The fact that young Japanese civil servants in Manchukuo with their degrees in economics, sociology, etc., who had once been active in left-wing movements helps explain the decidedly leftist thrust of social and economic policies in Manchukuo with the state playing an increasingly large role in society. Likewise, much of the debate between Japanese civil servants about the sort of social-economic policies Japan should follow in Manchukuo in the 1930s was framed in Marxist terms, with the civil servants arguing over whether Manchuria prior to September 1931 had a &quot;feudal&quot; or a &quot;capitalist&quot; economy. The American historian Joshua Fogel wrote about the young servants of Manchukuo: &quot;Tremendous debates transpired on such things as the nature of the Chinese economy, and the lingua franca of these debates was always Marxism&quot;. To resolve this debate, various research teams of five or six young civil servants, guarded by detachments from the Kwantung Army of about 20 or 30 men, went out to do field research in Manchukuo, gathering material about the life of ordinary people, to determine Manchukuo was in the &quot;feudal&quot; or &quot;capitalist&quot; stage of development. Starting in 1936, the Manchukuo state launched Five Year Plans for economic development, which were closely modeled after the Five Year Plans in the Soviet Union.

In theory, the Japanese were creating an entirely new, independent state, and this allowed for a considerable level of experimentation regarding the policies that the new state would be carrying out. Many university graduates in Japan who were ostensibly opposed to the social system within Japan itself, instead went to Manchukuo with the belief that they could implement reforms that might later inspire policy within Japan itself. This was especially the case since it was impossible to effect any reforms in Japan itself as the very act of thinking about &quot;altering the &quot;kokutai&quot;&quot; was a crime, which led many leftist Japanese university graduates to go work in Manchukuo, where they believed they could achieve the sort of social revolution that was impossible in Japan. By 1933, the Japanese state had essentially destroyed both the Japanese Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party via mass arrests and &quot;Tenkō&quot; with both parties reduced down to mere rumps, which caused many Japanese student leftists to draw the conclusion that change was impossible in Japan, but still possible in Manchukuo, where paradoxically the Kwantung Army was sponsoring the sort of policies that were unacceptable in Japan. Moreover, the Great Depression had made it very difficult for university graduates in Japan to find work, which made the prospect of a well-paying job in Manchukuo very attractive to otherwise underemployed Japanese university graduates. In Manchukuo, the Japanese state was creating an entire state anew, which meant that Manchukuo had a desperate need for university graduates to work in its newly founded civil service. In addition, the Pan-Asian rhetoric of Manchukuo and the prospect of Japan helping ordinary people in Manchuria greatly appealed to the idealistic youth of Japan. Young wrote about the young Japanese people who went to work in Manchukuo: &quot;The men, and in some cases, the women, who answered the call of this land of opportunity, brought with them tremendous drive and ambition. In their efforts to remake their own lives, they remade an empire. They invested it with their preoccupations of modernity and their dreams of a Utopian future. They pushed it to embrace idealist rhetoric of social reform and justified itself in terms of Chinese nationalist aspiration. They turned it to architectural ostentation and the heady luxury of colonial consumption. They made it into a project of radical change, experimentation and possibility&quot;.

The Kwantung Army for its part tolerated the talk of social revolution in Manchukuo as the best way of gaining support from the Han majority of Manchukuo, who did not want Manchuria to be severed from China. Even more active in going to Manchukuo were the products of &quot;Tenkō&quot; (&#x27;changing directions&#x27;), a process of brainwashing by the police of left-wing activists to make them accept that the Emperor was a god after all, whom they were best to serve. &quot;Tenko&quot; was a very successful process that turned young Japanese who once had been ardent liberals or leftists who rejected the idea that the Emperor was a god into fanatical rightists, who made up for their previous doubts about the divinity of the Emperor with militant enthusiasm. One &quot;tenkosha&quot; was Tachibana Shiraki, who had once been a Marxist Sinologist until after he was arrested and undergoing &quot;tenko&quot; became a fanatical right-winger. Tachibana went to Manchukuo in 1932, proclaiming that the theory of the &quot;five races&quot; working together was the best solution to Asia&#x27;s problems and argued in his writings that only Japan could save China from itself, which was a complete change from his previous policies, where he criticized Japan for exploiting China. Other left-wing activists like Ohgami Suehiro did not undergo &quot;tenko&quot;, but still went to work in Manchukuo, believing it was possible to effect social reforms that would end the &quot;semi-feudal&quot; condition of the Chinese peasants of Manchukuo, and that he could use the Kwantung Army to effect left-wing reforms in Manchukuo. Ohgami went to work in the &quot;agricultural economy&quot; desk of the Social Research Unit of the South Manchurian Railroad company, writing up reports about the rural economy of Manchukuo that were used by the Kwantung Army and the Manchukuo state. Ohgami believed that his studies helped ordinary people, citing one study he did about water use in rural Manchukuo, where he noted a correlation between villages that were deprived of water and &quot;banditry&quot; (the codeword for anti-Japanese guerrillas), believing that the policy of improving water supply in villages was due to his study. The outbreak of the war with China in 1937 caused the state in Manchukuo to grow even bigger as a policy of &quot;total war&quot; came in, which meant there was a pressing demand for people with university degrees trained to think &quot;scientifically&quot;. Fogel wrote that almost all of the university graduates from Japan who arrived in Manchukuo in the late 1930s were &quot;largely left-wing Socialists and Communists. This was precisely at the time when Marxism had been all but banned in Japan, when (as Yamada Gōichi put) &quot;if the expression &quot;shakai&quot; [social] appeared in the title of a book, it was usually confiscated&quot;.

Young also noted—with reference to Lord Acton&#x27;s dictum that &quot;Absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;—that for many of the idealistic young Japanese civil servants, who believed that they could affect a &quot;revolution from above&quot; that would make the lives of ordinary people better, that the absolute power that they enjoyed over millions of people &quot;went to their heads&quot;, causing them to behave with abusive arrogance towards the very people that they had gone to Manchukuo to help. Young wrote that it was a &quot;monumental conceit&quot; of the part of the young idealists to believe that they could use the Kwantung Army to achieve a &quot;revolution from above&quot; when it was the Kwantung Army that was using them. The ambitious plans for land reform in Manchukuo were vetoed by the Kwantung Army for precisely the reason that it might inspire similar reforms in Japan. The landlords in Japan tended to come from families who once belonged to the samurai caste, and almost all of the officers in the Imperial Japanese Army came from samurai families, which made the Kwantung Army very hostile towards any sort of land reform which might serve as an example for Japanese peasants. In October 1941, the Soviet spy ring headed by Richard Sorge was uncovered in Tokyo, which caused the authorities to become paranoid about Soviet espionage, and led to a new crackdown on the left. In November 1941, the Social Research Unit of the South Manchurian Railroad Company, which was well known as a hotbed of Marxism since the early 1930s, was raided by the &quot;Kenpeitai&quot;, who arrested 50 of those working in the Social Research Unit. At least 44 of those working in the Social Research Unit were convicted of violating the Peace Preservation Law, which made thinking about &quot;altering the &quot;kokutai&quot;&quot; a crime in 1942–43 and were given long prison sentences, of whom four died due to the harsh conditions of prisons in Manchukuo. As the men working in the Social Research Unit had played important roles in Manchukuo&#x27;s economic policy and were university graduates from good families, the Japanese historian Hotta Eri wrote that the &quot;Kenpeitai&quot; was ordered to &quot;handle them with care&quot;, meaning no torture of the sort that the &quot;Kenpeitai&quot; normally employed in its investigations.

When the Japanese surrender was announced on 15 August 1945, Puyi agreed to abdicate.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Manchukuo was initially divided into three provinces. This number increased to five in 1934 when Sanjiang and Heihe were split off from Longjiang Province. A special ward of Beiman () existed between 1 July 1933 and 1 January 1936. In 1941, Manchukuo was reorganized into 19 provinces, with the two special cities of Xinjing and Harbin. Each province was in turn divided in four (Xing&#x27;an dong) and 24 (Fengtian) prefectures. Harbin was later incorporated into Binjiang province. Andong and Jinzhou provinces separated themselves from Fengtian while Binjiang and Jiandao separated themselves from Jilin in the same year.

== Economy ==

Manchukuo experienced rapid economic growth. During the 1920s, the Japanese Army under the influence of the &quot;Wehrstaat&quot; (Defense State) theories popular with the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; had started to advocate their own version of the &quot;Wehrstaat&quot;, the totalitarian &quot;national defense state&quot; which would mobilize an entire society for war in peacetime. At least part of the reason why the Kwantung Army seized Manchuria in 1931 was to use it as a laboratory for creating an economic system geared towards the &quot;national defense state&quot;; colonial Manchuria offered up possibilities for the army carrying out drastic economic changes that were not possible in Japan. 

Industrial development in Manchukuo was accomplished with state planning and Japanese investment, prioritizing military build-up and heavy industry without an emphasis on profitability. 

From the beginning, the Army intended to turn Manchukuo into the industrial heartland of the empire. Economic planning in Manchukuo was influenced by Japanese observations of the Soviet approach to catch-up industrialization and reflected in Manchukuo&#x27;s Five Year Plan for Heavy Industry. The development of industry in Manchukuo further influenced Japanese economic mobilization following the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War.

The &quot;Zaibatsu&quot; were excluded from Manchukuo and all of the heavy industrial factories were built and owned by Army-owned corporations. In 1935, there was a change when the &quot;reform bureaucrat&quot; Nobusuke Kishi was appointed Deputy Minister of Industrial Development. Kishi persuaded the Army to allow the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; to invest in Manchukuo, arguing that having the state carry out the entire industrialization of Manchukuo was costing too much money. Kishi pioneered an elitist system where bureaucrats such as himself developed economic plans, which the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; had to then carry out. Kishi succeeded in marshaling private capital in a very strongly state-directed economy to achieve his goal of vastly increased industrial production while at the same time displaying utter indifference to the exploited Chinese workers toiling in Manchukuo&#x27;s factories; the American historian Mark Driscoll described Kishi&#x27;s system as a &quot;necropolitical&quot; system where the Chinese workers were literally treated as dehumanized cogs within a vast industrial machine. The system that Kishi pioneered in Manchuria of a state-guided economy where corporations made their investments on government orders later served as the model for Japan&#x27;s post-1945 development, albeit not with same level of brutal exploitation as in Manchukuo. By the 1930s, Manchukuo&#x27;s industrial system was among the most advanced making it one of the industrial powerhouses in the region. Manchukuo&#x27;s steel production exceeded Japan&#x27;s in the late 1930s. Many Manchurian cities were modernized during the Manchukuo era. 

Much of the country&#x27;s economy was often subordinated to Japanese interests and, during the war, raw material flowed into Japan to support the war effort. Traditional lands were taken and redistributed to Japanese farmers with local farmers relocated and forced into collective farming units over smaller areas of land. Chinese workers were the target of pervasive discrimination. Japanese and Manchukuo authorities used Chinese prisoners of war for forced labor.

=== Transportation ===
When Manchukuo was founded as a Japanese puppet state, it inherited the railroad network of Manchuria that was built originally during an economic and military struggle between Russia and Japan over Chinese territory and became a focal point before and after the Russo-Japanese War. Chinese warlords had also aimed to build local lines when possible. Manchukuo&#x27;s railroad system would consist mainly of the South Manchuria Railway, a Japanese concession in the Republic of China, and the Chinese Eastern Railway, a Russian concession which was still owned by the Soviet Union inside Manchukuo. The Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japanese Manchukuo in 1935, giving Japan and Manchukuo full control over the railroads of Manchuria.

The Japanese built an efficient railway system that still functions well today. Known as the South Manchuria Railway or &quot;Mantetsu&quot;, this large corporation came to own large stakes in many industrial projects throughout the region. Mantetsu personnel were involved in the economic exploitation of occupied China during World War II, and colonial planning at the behest of the Imperial Japanese Army. Many railway lines in Manchukuo were owned by the Manchukuo National Railway. After 1933, the Manchukuo National Railway was fully owned by the South Manchuria Railway/Mantetsu. Mantetsu had close to monopoly status and its properties were guarded by the Kwantung Army.

By the end of World War II, the South Manchuria Railway owned 70 companies and employed about 340,000 people in Manchukuo and occupied China.

== Demographics ==

In 1908, the number of residents was 15,834,000, which rose to 30,000,000 in 1931 and 43,000,000 for the Manchukuo state. The population balance remained 123 men to 100 women and the total number in 1941 was 50,000,000.

In early 1934, the total population of Manchukuo was estimated as 30,880,000, with 6.1 persons the average family, and 122 men for each 100 women. These numbers included 29,510,000 Chinese (96%, which should have included the Manchu people), 590,760 Japanese (2%), 680,000 Koreans (2%), and 98,431 (&lt;1%) of other nationality: White Russians, Mongols, etc. Around 80% of the population was rural. During the existence of Manchukuo, the ethnic balance did not change significantly, except that Japan increased the Korean population in China. From Japanese sources come these numbers: in 1940 the total population in Manchukuo of Longjiang, Rehe, Jilin, Fengtian, and Xing&#x27;an provinces at 43,233,954; or an Interior Ministry figure of 31,008,600. Another figure of the period estimated the total population as 36,933,000 residents. The majority of Han Chinese in Manchukuo believed that Manchuria was rightfully part of China, and they both passively and violently resisted Japan&#x27;s propaganda that Manchukuo was a &quot;multinational state&quot;.

After the Russian Civil War (1917–1922), thousands of Russians fled to Manchuria to join the Russian community already there. The Russians living in Manchuria were stateless and as whites had an ambiguous status in Manchukuo, which was meant to be a Pan-Asian state, whose official &quot;five races&quot; were the Chinese, Mongols, Manchus, Koreans, and Japanese. At various times, the Japanese suggested that the Russians might be a &quot;sixth race&quot; of Manchukuo, but this was never officially declared. In 1936, the &quot;Manchukuo Almanac&quot; reported that were 33,592 Russians living in the city of Harbin—the &quot;Moscow of the Orient&quot;—and of whom only 5,580 had been granted Manchukuo citizenship. Japanese imperialism was to a certain extent based on racism with the Japanese as the &quot;great Yamato race&quot;, but there was always a certain dichotomy in Japanese thinking between an ideology based on racial differences based on bloodlines versus the idea of Pan-Asianism with Japan as the natural leader of all the Asian peoples. In 1940, ethnic Russians were included among the other nationalities of Manchukuo as candidates for conscription into the Manchukuo military.
Until World War II, the Japanese tended to leave alone those travelling to Manchukuo with a passport as they did not like to deal with protests from embassies in Tokyo about the mistreatment of their citizens. The Kwantung Army operated a secret biological-chemical warfare unit based in Pinfang, Unit 731, that performed gruesome experiments on people involving much visceration of the subjects to see the effects of chemicals and germs on the human body. In the late 1930s, the doctors of Unit 731 demanded more European subjects to experiment upon in order to test the efficiency the strains of anthrax and plague that they were developing, leading to a great many of the Russians living in Manchukuo becoming the unwilling human guinea pigs of Unit 731. The Russian Fascist Party, which worked with the Japanese, was used to kidnap various &quot;unreliable&quot; Russians living in Manchukuo for Unit 731 to experiment upon.

The children of the Russian exiles often married Han Chinese, and the resulting children were always known in Manchukuo as &quot;mixed water&quot; people, and were shunned by both the Russian and Chinese communities. Chinese accounts, both at the time and later, tended to portray the Russians living in Manchuria as all prostitutes and thieves, and almost always ignored the contributions made by middle-class Russians to community life. Mindful of the way that Americans and most Europeans enjoyed extraterritorial rights in China at the time, accounts in Chinese literature about the Russians living in Manchukuo and their &quot;mixed water&quot; children often display a certain &quot;schadenfreude&quot; recounting how the Russians in Manchukuo usually lived in poverty on the margins of Manchukuo society with the local Chinese more economically successful. The South Korean historian Bong Inyoung noted when it came to writing about the &quot;mixed water&quot; people, Chinese writers tended to treat them as not entirely Chinese, but on the other hand were willing to accept these people as Chinese provided that would totally embrace Chinese culture by renouncing their Russian heritage, thus making Chineseness as much a matter of culture as of race.

Around the same time the Soviet Union was advocating the Siberian Jewish Autonomous Oblast across the Manchukuo-Soviet border, some Japanese officials investigated a plan (known as the Fugu Plan) to attract Jewish refugees to Manchukuo as part of their colonisation effort, which was never adopted as official policy. The Jewish community in Manchukuo was not subjected to the official persecution that Jews experienced under Japan&#x27;s ally Nazi Germany, and Japanese authorities were involved in closing down local anti-Semitic publications such as the Russian Fascist Party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Nash Put&quot;. However, Jews in Manchukuo were victims of harassment by antisemitic elements among the White Russian population, one notable incident being the murder of Simon Kaspé. In 1937 the Far Eastern Jewish Council was created, chaired by the Harbin Jewish community leader Dr. Abraham Kaufman. Between 1937 and 1939 the city of Harbin in Manchukuo was the location of the Conference of Jewish Communities in the Far East. Following the Russian Red Army&#x27;s invasion of Manchuria in 1945, Dr. Kaufman and several other Jewish community leaders were arrested by the Soviets and charged with anti-Soviet activities, resulting in Kaufman&#x27;s imprisonment for ten years in a Soviet labor camp.

The Japanese Ueda Kyōsuke labeled all 30 million people in Manchuria as &quot;Manchus&quot;, including Han Chinese, despite the fact that most of them were not ethnic Manchu, and the Japanese written, &quot;Great Manchukuo&quot; built upon Ueda&#x27;s argument to claim that all 30 million &quot;Manchus&quot; in Manchukuo had the right to independence to justify splitting Manchukuo from China. In 1942 the Japanese wrote &quot;Ten Year History of the Construction of Manchukuo&quot; which attempted to emphasize the right of ethnic Japanese to the land of Manchukuo while attempting to delegitimize the Manchu&#x27;s claim to Manchukuo as their native land, noting that most Manchus moved out during the Qing period and only returned later.

=== Japanese population ===
In 1931–1932, there were 100,000 Japanese farmers; other sources mention 590,760 Japanese inhabitants. Other figures for Manchukuo speak of a Japanese population 240,000 strong, later growing to 837,000. In Xinjing, they made up 25% of the population. Accordingly, to the census of 1936, of the Japanese population of Manchukuo, 22% were civil servants and their families; 18% were working for the South Manchurian Railroad company; 25% had come to Manchukuo to establish a business, and 21% had come to work in industry. The Japanese working in the fields of transportation, the government, and in business tended to be middle class, white-collar people such as executives, engineers, and managers, and those Japanese who working in Manchukuo as blue-collar employees tended to be skilled workers. In 1934, it was reported that a Japanese carpenter working in Manchukuo with its growing economy could earn twice as much as he could in Japan. With its gleaming modernist office buildings, state of the art transport networks like the famous Asia Express railroad line, and modern infrastructure that was going up all over Manchukuo, Japan&#x27;s newest colony become a popular tourist destination for middle-class Japanese, who wanted to see the &quot;Brave New Empire&quot; that was going up in the mainland of Asia. The Japanese government had official plans projecting the emigration of 5 million Japanese to Manchukuo between 1936 and 1956. Between 1938 and 1942 a batch of young farmers of 200,000 arrived in Manchukuo; joining this group after 1936 were 20,000 complete families. Of the Japanese settlers in Manchukuo, almost half came from the rural areas of Kyushu. When Japan lost sea and air control of the Yellow Sea in 1943–44, this migration stopped. About 2% of the Japanese population worked in agriculture. Many had been young, land-poor farmers in Japan that were recruited by the Patriotic Youth Brigade to colonize new settlements in Manchukuo. The Manchukuo Government had seized great portions of these land through &quot;price manipulation, coerced sales and forced evictions&quot;. Some Japanese settlers gained so much land that they could not farm it themselves and had to hire Chinese or Korean laborers for help, or even lease some of it back to its former Chinese owners, leading to uneasy, sometimes hostile relations between the groups.

When the Red Army invaded Manchukuo, they captured 850,000 Japanese settlers. With the exception of some civil servants and soldiers, these were repatriated to Japan in 1946–7. Many Japanese orphans in China were left behind in the confusion by the Japanese government and were adopted by Chinese families. Many, however, integrated well into Chinese society. In the 1980s Japan began to organize a repatriation program for them but not all chose to go back to Japan.

The majority of Japanese left behind in China were women, and these Japanese women mostly married Chinese men and became known as &quot;stranded war wives&quot; (zanryu fujin). Because they had children fathered by Chinese men, the Japanese women were not allowed to bring their Chinese families back with them to Japan, so most of them stayed. Japanese law allowed children fathered only by Japanese to become Japanese citizens.

== Legal system ==
Although the League of Nations ruled that Japan had broken international law by seizing Manchuria, the Japanese invested much effort into giving Manchukuo a legal system, believing that this was the fastest way for international recognition of Manchukuo. A particular problem for the Japanese was that Manchukuo was always presented as a new type of state: a multi-ethnic Pan-Asian state comprising Japanese, Koreans, Manchus, Mongols and Chinese to mark the birth of the &quot;New Order in Asia&quot;. Typical of the rhetoric surrounding Manchukuo was always portrayed as the birth of a glorious new civilization was the press release issued by the Japanese Information Service on 1 March 1932 announcing the &quot;glorious advent&quot; of Manchukuo with the &quot;eyes of the world turned on it&quot; proclaimed that the birth of Manchukuo was an &quot;epochal event of far-reaching consequences in world history, marking the birth of a new era in government, racial relations, and other affairs of general interest. Never in the chronicles of the human species was any State born with such high ideals, and never has any State accomplished so much in such a brief space of its existence as Manchukuo&quot;.

The Japanese went out of their way to try to ensure that Manchukuo was the embodiment of modernity in all of its aspects, as it was intended to prove to the world what the Asian peoples could accomplish if they worked together. Manchukuo&#x27;s legal system was based upon the Organic Law of 1932, which featured a 12 article Human Rights Protection Law and a supposedly independent judiciary to enforce the law. The official ideology of Manchukuo was the &quot;wangdao&quot; (&quot;Kingly Way&quot;) devised by a former mandarin under the Qing turned Prime Minister of Manchukuo Zheng Xiaoxu calling for an ordered Confucian society that would promote justice and harmony that was billed at the time as the beginning of a new era in world history. The purpose of the law in Manchukuo was not the protection of the rights of the individual, as the &quot;wangdao&quot; ideology was expressly hostile towards individualism, which was seen as a decadent European concept inimical to Asia, but rather the interests of the state by ensuring that subjects fulfilled their duties to the emperor. The &quot;wangdao&quot; favored the collective over the individual, as the &quot;wangdao&quot; called for all people to put the needs of society ahead of their own needs. Zheng together with the Japanese legal scholar Ishiwara Kanji in a joint statement attacked the European legal tradition for promoting individualism, which they claimed led to selfishness, greed and materialism, and argued that the &quot;wangdao&quot; with its disregard for the individual was a morally superior system. The seemingly idealistic Human Rights Protection Law counterbalanced the &quot;rights&quot; of the subjects with their &quot;responsibilities&quot; to the state with a greater emphasis on the latter, just as was the case in Japan. The &quot;wangdao&quot; promoted Confucian morality and spirituality, which was seen as coming down from Emperor Puyi, and as such, the legal system existed to serve the needs of the state headed by Emperor Puyi, who could change the laws as he saw fit. In this regard it is noteworthy that Legislative Yuan had only the power of &quot;assisting&quot; the Emperor with making laws, being endowed with far fewer powers than even the Imperial Diet in Japan had, which had the power to reject or approve laws. It was often suggested at the time that the Legislative Yuan of Manchukuo was a model for the Imperial Diet in Japan, an idea Hirohito, the Japanese emperor, was sympathetic to, but never took up. Hirohito in the end preferred the Meiji constitution passed by his grandfather in 1889 as it gave the Emperor of Japan ultimate power, while at the same time the fictitious nature of the Imperial Diet together with a prime minister and his cabinet governing Japan gave the Emperor a scapegoat when things went wrong.

Initially, the judges who had served the Zhangs were retained, but in 1934, the Judicial Law College headed by the Japanese judge Furuta Masatake was opened in Changchun, to be replaced by a larger Law University in 1937. Right from the start, the new applicants vastly exceeded the number of openings as the first class of the Law College numbered only 100, but 1,210 students had applied. The legal system that the students were trained was closely modeled after the Japanese legal system, which in its turn was modeled after the French legal system, but there were a number of particularities unique to Manchukuo. Law students were trained to write essays on such topics as the &quot;theory of the harmony of the five races [of Manchukuo]&quot;, the &quot;political theory of the Kingly Way&quot;, &quot;practical differences between consular jurisdiction and extraterritoriality&quot;, and how best to &quot;realize the governance of the Kingly Way&quot;. The Japanese professors were &quot;astonished&quot; by the &quot;enthusiasm&quot; which the students wrote their essays on these subjects as the students expressed the hope that the &quot;wangdao&quot; was a uniquely Asian solution to the problems of the modern world, and that Manchukuo represented nothing less than the beginning of a new civilization that would lead to a utopian society in the near future. The Japanese professors were greatly impressed with the Confucian idealism of their students, but noted that their students all used stock phrases to the extent it was hard to tell their essays apart, cited examples of wise judges from ancient China while ignoring more recent legal developments, and were long on expressing idealistic statements about how the &quot;wangdao&quot; would lead to a perfect society, but were short on how explaining just how this was to be done in practice.

An example of the extent of Japanese influence on the legal system of Manchukuo was that every issue of the &quot;Manchukuo Legal Advisory Journal&quot; always contained a summary of the most recent rulings by the Supreme Court of Japan, and the reasons why the Japanese Supreme Court had ruled in these cases. However, there were some differences between the Manchukuo and Japanese legal systems. In Japan itself, corporal punishment had been abolished as part of the successful effort to end the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by citizens of the European powers but retained for the Japanese colonies of Korea and Taiwan. However, corporal punishment, especially flogging, was a major part of the Manchukuo legal system with judges being very much inclined to impose floggings on low-income Chinese men convicted of minor offenses that would normally merit only a fine or a short prison sentence in Japan. Writing in a legal journal in 1936, Ono Jitsuo, a Japanese judge serving in Manchukuo, regretted having to impose floggings as a punishment for relatively minor crimes but argued that it was necessary of Manchukuo&#x27;s 30 million people &quot;more than half are ignorant and completely illiterate barbarians&quot; who were too poor to pay fines and too numerous to imprison. In Taiwan and Korea, Japanese law was supreme, but judges in both colonies had to respect &quot;local customs&quot; in regard to family law. In the case of Manchukuo, a place with a Han majority, but that ideology proclaimed the &quot;five races&quot; of Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Manchus, and Mongols as all equal, this led in effect to several family laws for each of the &quot;five races&quot; respecting their &quot;local customs&quot; plus the Russian and Hui Muslim minorities.

=== Policing ===
The Manchukuo police had the power to arrest without charge anyone who was engaged in the vaguely defined crime of &quot;undermining the state&quot;. Manchukuo had an extensive system of courts at four levels staffed by a mixture of Chinese and Japanese judges. All of the courts had both two Japanese and two Chinese judges with the Chinese serving as the nominal superior judges and the Japanese the junior judges, but in practice the Japanese judges were the masters and the Chinese judges puppets. Despite the claims that the legal system of Manchukuo was a great improvement over the legal system presided over by Marshal Zhang Xueliang the &quot;Young Marshal&quot;, the courts in Manchukuo were inefficient and slow, and ignored by the authorities whenever it suited them. In Asia, the rule of law and an advanced legal system are commonly seen as one of the marks of &quot;civilization&quot;, which is why the chaotic and corrupt legal system run by Marshal Zhang was denigrated so much by the Japanese and Manchukuo media. In the early 1930s, Manchukuo attracted much legal talent from Japan as Japanese Pan-Asian idealists went to Manchuria with the goal of establishing a world-class legal system. As the Kwantung Army had the ultimate power in Manchukuo, the best Japanese judges by the late 1930s preferred not to go to Manchukuo where their decisions could be constantly second-guessed, and instead only the second-rate judges went to Manchukuo. By 1937 the Japanese judges and lawyers in Manchukuo were either disillusioned Pan-Asian idealists or more commonly cynical opportunists and mediocre hacks who lacked the talent to get ahead in Japan. By contrast, the best of the ethnic Chinese law schools&#x27; graduates in Manchukuo chose to work as part of Manchukuo&#x27;s judicial system, suggesting many middle-class Chinese families were prepared to accept Manchukuo. White Russian emigres were recruited into the mountain forest police and the border police forces in the early 1930s.

Starting with the Religions Law of May 1938, a cult of Emperor-worship closely modeled after the Imperial cult in Japan where Hirohito was worshiped as a living god, began in Manchukuo. Just as in Japan, schoolchildren began their classes by praying to a portrait of the emperor while imperial rescripts, and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor. As the Emperor Puyi was considered to be a living god, his will could not be limited by any law, and the purpose of the law was starkly reduced down to serving the will of the emperor rather than upholding values and rules. As in Japan, the idea governing the legal philosophy in Manchukuo was the Emperor was a living god who was responsible to no-one and who delegated some of his powers down to mere human beings who had the duty of obeying the will of the god-emperors. In Japan and Manchukuo, the actions of the god-emperors were always just and moral because gods could never do wrong, rather than because the god-emperors were acting to uphold moral values that existed &quot;a priori&quot;.

Again following the Japanese system, in 1937 a new category of &quot;thought crime&quot; was introduced declaring that certain thoughts were now illegal and those thinking these forbidden thoughts were &quot;thought criminals&quot;. People were thus convicted not for their actions, but merely for their thoughts. After the war with China began in July 1937, an &quot;emergency law&quot; was declared in Manchukuo, placing it under a type of martial law that suspended the theoretical civil liberties that existed up to that point, ordered the mobilization of society for total war, and increased the tempo of repression with the law on &quot;thought crimes&quot; being merely the most dramatic example. In April 1938, a new type of Special Security Court was created for those charged with the five types of &quot;thought crime&quot;. On 26 August 1941, a new security law ruled that those tried before the Special Security Courts had no right of appeal or to a defense lawyer. One Special Security Court in Jinzhou between 1942 and 1945 sentenced about 1,700 people to death and another 2,600 for life imprisonment for &quot;thought crimes&quot;, a figure that appears to be typical of the special courts. The police frequently used torture to obtain confessions and those tried in the Special Security Courts had no right to examine the evidence against them. Starting in 1943 the number of those tried and convicted by the courts rose drastically, though the number of death sentences remained stable. The rise in the number of convictions was due to the need for slave labor for the factories and mines of Manchukuo as the traditional supplies of slave labor from northern China were disturbed by World War II as most of those convicted were sentenced to work in the factories and mines. The American historian Thomas David Dubois wrote the legal system of Manchukuo went through two phases: the first lasting from 1931 to 1937, when the Japanese wanted to show the world a state with an ultra-modern legal system that was meant to be a shining tribute to Asians working together in brotherhood; and the second from 1937 to 1945 when the legal system becomes more of a tool for the totalitarian mobilization of society for total war.

== Military ==

The Manchukuo Imperial Army was the ground component of Manchukuo&#x27;s armed forces and consisted of as many as 170,000 to 220,000 troops at its peak in 1945 by some estimates, having formally been established by the Army and Navy Act of 15 April 1932. The majority of the soldiers were Manchurian-born Han Chinese, with smaller groups of Koreans, Mongols, and White Russian emigres, who were all trained and led by Japanese instructors and advisors. Despite the numerous attempts by the Japanese to improve the combat capability of the Imperial Army and instill a Manchukuoan patriotic spirit among its troops, most of its units were regarded as unreliable by Japanese officers. Their main role was to fight Nationalist and Communist insurgents who continued to resist the Japanese occupation of northeastern China, and occasionally the Manchukuo Imperial Army took part in operations against the Chinese National Revolutionary Army and the Soviet Red Army (in support of the Imperial Japanese Army). Initially its members were former soldiers of Marshal Zhang Xueliang&#x27;s warlord army who had surrendered to Japan during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. But since the Young Marshal&#x27;s former troops were not sufficiently loyal to the new regime and performed poorly against partisans, the new government of Manchukuo took efforts to recruit—and later draft—new soldiers. In 1934 a law was passed stating that only those that had been trained by the government of Manchukuo could serve as officers. The Military Supplies Requisition Law of 13 May 1937 allowed Japanese and Manchukuo authorities to draft forced laborers. The actual calling up of conscripts for the army did not begin until 1940, at which point all youths received a physical and 10% were to be selected for service. Between 1938 and 1940, several military academies were established to provide a new officer corps for the Imperial Army, including a specific school for ethnic Mongols and one for White Russians.

After fighting against insurgents during the early to mid-1930s, the Manchukuo Imperial Army played mainly a supporting role during the actions in Inner Mongolia against Chinese forces, with news reports stating that some Manchukuoan units performed fairly well. Later it fought against the Soviet Red Army during the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts. A skirmish between Manchukuoan and Mongolian cavalry in May 1939 escalated as both sides brought in reinforcements and began the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. Although they did not perform well in the battle overall, the Japanese considered their actions useful enough to warrant expansion of the Manchukuo Army. Throughout the 1940s the only action it saw was against Communist guerrilla fighters and other insurgents, although the Japanese chose to rely only on the more elite units while the majority were used for garrison and security duty. Although Japan took the effort of equipping the Manchukuoan forces with some artillery (in addition to the wide variety it had inherited from Zhang Xueliang&#x27;s army) along with some elderly tankettes and armored cars, the cavalry was the Imperial Army&#x27;s most effective and developed branch. This was the force that confronted the 76 battle-hardened Red Army divisions transferred from the European front in August 1945 for the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. The cavalry branch saw the most combat against the Red Army, but they and their depleted Japanese Kwantung Army allies were quickly swept aside by the Soviet offensive. While some units remained loyal to their Japanese allies and put up a resistance, many mutinied against their Japanese advisors while others simply melted away into the countryside. Many of these Manchukuo Army troops would later join the Communists since the Chinese Nationalists executed former collaborators with Japan, becoming an important source of manpower and equipment for the Communists in the region.

The other two branches, the Manchukuo Imperial Air Force and the Manchukuo Imperial Navy, were small and underdeveloped, largely existing as token forces to give legitimacy to the Manchukuo regime. An Air Force was established in February 1937 with 30 men selected from the Manchukuo Imperial Army who were trained at the Japanese Kwantung Army aircraft arsenal in Harbin (initially the Kwantung Army did not trust the Manchukuoans enough to train a native air force for them). The Imperial Air Force&#x27;s predecessor was the Manchukuo Air Transport Company, a paramilitary airline formed in 1931, which undertook transport and reconnaissance missions for the Japanese military. The first air unit was based in Xinjing and equipped with just one Nieuport-Delage NiD 29 and was later expanded with Nakajima Army Type 91 fighters and Kawasaki Type 88 light bombers. Two more air units were established, but they suffered a setback when one hundred pilots took their aircraft and defected to insurgents after murdering their Japanese instructors. Nonetheless, three fighter squadrons were formed in 1942 from the first batch of cadets, being equipped with Nakajima Ki-27 fighters in addition to Tachikawa Ki-9s and Tachikawa Ki-55 trainers, along with some Mitsubishi Ki-57 transports. In 1945, because of American bombing raids, they were issued with Nakajima Ki-43 fighters to have a better chance of intercepting B-29 Superfortresses. Some pilots saw action against the American bombers and at least one Ki-27 pilot downed a B-29 by ramming it with his plane in a kamikaze attack. The air force practically ceased to exist by the Soviet invasion but there were isolated instances of Manchukuoan planes attacking Soviet forces.

The Imperial Navy of Manchukuo existed mainly as a small river flotilla and consisted mainly of small gunboats and patrol boats, both captured Chinese ships and some Japanese additions. The elderly Japanese destroyer &quot;Kashi&quot; was lent to the Manchukuoan fleet from 1937 to 1942 as the &quot;Hai Wei&quot; before returning to the Imperial Japanese Navy. These ships were mostly crewed by Japanese sailors.

Several specialized units which functioned outside of the main command structure of the military also existed. The Manchukuo Imperial Guard was formed out of soldiers of ethnic Manchu descent, charged with the protection of the Kangde Emperor and senior officials, as well as to function as an honor guard. Despite this it took part in combat and was considered to be an effective unit. Throughout the 1930s a &quot;Mongolian Independence Army&quot; was established out of about 6,000 ethnic Mongolian recruits and fought its own war against bandits with some success. It was expanded in 1938 but merged with the regular Imperial Army in 1940, although Mongol units continued to perform well. A special Korean detachment was founded in 1937 on the personal initiative of , a collaborationist Korean governor of Gando Province. The unit was small but distinguished itself in combat against Communist guerrillas and was noted by the Japanese for its martial spirit, becoming one of the few puppet units to earn the respect of its Japanese superiors.

== Human rights abuses ==

=== War crimes ===
According to a joint study by historians Zhifen Ju, Mitsuyochi Himeta, Toru Kubo, and Mark Peattie, more than ten million Chinese civilians were used by the Kwantung Army for slave labor in Manchukuo under the supervision of the Kōa-in.

The Chinese slave laborers often suffered illness due to high-intensity manual labor. Some badly ill workers were directly pushed into mass graves in order to avoid the medical expenditure and the world&#x27;s most serious mine disaster, at Benxihu Colliery, happened in Manchukuo.

Bacteriological weapons were experimented on humans by the infamous Unit 731 located near Harbin in Beiyinhe from 1932 to 1936 and to Pingfan until 1945. Victims, mostly Chinese, Russians and Koreans, were subjected to vivisection, sometimes without anesthesia.

=== Abuse of ethnic minorities ===

The Oroqen suffered a significant population decline under Japanese rule. The Japanese distributed opium among them and subjected some members of the community to human experiments, and combined with incidents of epidemic diseases this caused their population to decline until only 1,000 remained. The Japanese banned Oroqen from communicating with other ethnicities, and forced them to hunt animals for them in exchange for rations and clothing which were sometimes insufficient for survival, which led to deaths from starvation and exposure. Opium was distributed to Oroqen adults older than 18 as a means of control. After 2 Japanese troops were killed in Alihe by an Oroqen hunter, the Japanese poisoned 40 Oroqen to death. The Japanese forced Oroqen to fight for them in the war which led to a population decrease of Oroqen people. Even those Oroqen who avoided direct control by the Japanese found themselves facing conflict from anti-Japanese forces of the Chinese Communists, which contributed to their population decline during this period.

Between 1931 and 1945, the Hezhen population declined by 80% or 90%, due to heavy opium use and deaths from Japanese cruelty, such as slave labor and relocation by the Japanese.

=== Drug trafficking ===
In 2007, an article by Reiji Yoshida in &quot;The Japan Times&quot; argued that Japanese investments in Manchukuo were partly financed by selling drugs. According to the article, a document found by Yoshida shows that the Kōa-in was directly implicated in providing funds to drug dealers in China for the benefit of the puppet governments of Manchukuo, Nanjing and Mongolia. This document corroborates evidence analyzed earlier by the Tokyo tribunal which stated that:

== International relations and recognition ==
Following the seizure of Manchuria by Japanese troops in September 1931, the League of Nations dispatched the Lytton Commission to investigate the situation in December of that year. The pretext for the Japanese invasion was an alleged bombing by Chinese soldiers of a railway controlled by Japan at Liutiaogou in Manchuria, despite widespread knowledge that the Japanese army had orchestrated it. This event, referred to as the &#x27;Manchurian Incident,&#x27; resulted in the establishment of the state of Manchukuo under Japanese control. While there was much doubt over the truth of the Incident, including from the members of the Lytton Commission, it was not until after the Tokyo War Crimes Trials that documents revealed that the Manchurian Incident was fabricated by Japanese military officers. Manchukuo was merely a puppet state of Japan; and Japan&#x27;s actions constituted unjustified aggression. When the League of Nations officially endorsed the Lytton Report in February 1933, Japan responded by withdrawing from the international organization. The Manchukuo case persuaded the United States to articulate the Stimson Doctrine, under which international recognition was withheld from changes in the international system created by the force of arms.

In spite of the League&#x27;s approach, the new state was diplomatically recognized by El Salvador (3 March 1934) and the Dominican Republic (1934), Costa Rica (23 September 1934), Italy (29 November 1937), Spain (2 December 1937), Germany (12 May 1938) and Hungary (9 January 1939). The Soviet Union extended de facto recognition on 23 March 1935, but explicitly noted that this did not mean de jure recognition. However, upon signing the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact on 13 April 1941, the Soviet Union recognized Manchukuo de jure in exchange for Japan recognizing the integrity of neighboring Mongolia. The USSR did maintain five consulates-general in Manchukuo initially, although in 1936–37 these were reduced to just two: one in Harbin and another in Manzhouli. Manchukuo opened consulates in Blagoveshchensk (September 1932) and in Chita (February 1933).

It is commonly believed that the Holy See established diplomatic relations with Manchukuo in 1934, but the Holy See never did so. This belief is partly due to the erroneous reference in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; that the Holy See diplomatically recognized Manchukuo. Bishop Auguste Ernest Pierre Gaspais was appointed as &quot;representative &quot;ad tempus&quot; of the Holy See and of the Catholic missions of Manchukuo to the government of Manchukuo&quot; by the Congregation De Propaganda Fide (a purely religious body responsible for missions) and not by the Secretariat of State responsible for diplomatic relations with states. In the 1940s the Vatican established full diplomatic relations with Japan, but it resisted Japanese and Italian pressure to recognize Manchukuo and the Nanking regime.

After the outbreak of World War II, the state was recognized by Slovakia (1 June 1940), Vichy France (12 July 1940), Romania (1 December 1940), Bulgaria (10 May 1941), Finland (17 July 1941), Denmark (August 1941), Croatia (2 August 1941)—all controlled or influenced by Japan&#x27;s ally Germany—as well as by Wang Jingwei&#x27;s Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China (30 November 1940), Thailand (5 August 1941) and the Philippines (1943)—all under the control or influence of Japan.

== Society and culture ==

=== National symbols ===

Aside from the national flag, the orchid, reportedly Puyi&#x27;s favorite flower, became the royal flower of the country, similar to the chrysanthemum in Japan. The sorghum flower also became a national flower by decree in April 1933. &quot;Five Races Under One Union&quot; was used as a national motto.

=== Education ===
Manchukuo developed an efficient public education system. The government established many schools and technical colleges, 12,000 primary schools in Manchukuo, 200 middle schools, 140 normal schools (for preparing teachers), and 50 technical and professional schools. In total the system had 600,000 children and young pupils and 25,000 teachers. Local Chinese children and Japanese children usually attended different schools, and the ones who did attend the same school were segregated by ethnicity, with the Japanese students assigned to better-equipped classes.

Confucius&#x27;s teachings also played an important role in Manchukuo&#x27;s public school education. In rural areas, students were trained to practice modern agricultural techniques to improve production. Education focused on practical work training for boys and domestic work for girls, all based on obedience to the &quot;Kingly Way&quot; and stressing loyalty to the Emperor. The regime used numerous festivals, sports events, and ceremonies to foster loyalty of citizens. Eventually, Japanese became the official language in addition to the Chinese taught in Manchukuo schools.

=== Film ===

The Photographic Division, part of the public relations section of the South Manchurian Railway was created in 1928 to produce short documentary films about Manchuria to Japanese audiences. In 1937, the Manchukuo Film Association was established by the government and the South Manchurian Railway in a studio in Jilin province. It was founded by Masahiko Amakasu, who also helped the career of Yoshiko Ōtaka, also known as Ri Koran. He also tried to ensure that Manchukuo would have its own industry and would be catering mainly to Manchurian audiences. The films for the most part usually promote pro-Manchukuo and pro-Japanese views. General Amakasu shot various &quot;documentaries&quot; showing carefully choreographed scenes worthy of Hollywood of Emperor Puyi in his capital of Xinjing (modern Changchun) being cheered by thousands of subjects and reviewing his troops marching in parades that were intended to help legitimize Manchukuo&#x27;s independence. After World War II, the archives and the equipment of the association were used by the Changchun Film Studio of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== Dress ===
The Changshan and the Qipao, both derived from traditional Manchu dress, were considered national dresses in Manchukuo.

In a meeting with the Concordia Association, the organizers devised what was termed Concordia Costume, or the &quot;kyōwafuku&quot;, in 1936. Even Japanese such as Masahiko Amakasu and Kanji Ishiwara adopted it. It was gray and a civilianized version of the Imperial Japanese Army uniform. It was similar to the National Clothes (&quot;kokumin-fuku&quot;) worn by Japanese civilians in World War II as well as the Zhongshan suit. A pin of either a Manchukuo flag or a five-pointed, five-colored star with the Manchukuo national colors were worn on the collars.

=== Sport ===

Manchukuo had a national football team, and football was considered the country&#x27;s de facto national sport; the Football Association of Manchukuo was formed around it.

Manchukuo hosted and participated in baseball matches with Japanese teams. Some of the games of the Intercity baseball tournament were held in the country, and played with local teams.

Manchukuo was to compete in the 1932 Summer Olympics, but one of the athletes who intended to represent Manchukuo, Liu Changchun, refused to join the team and instead joined as the first Chinese representative in the Olympics. There were attempts by Japanese authorities to let Manchukuo join the 1936 games, but the Olympic Committee persisted in the policy of not allowing an unrecognized state to join the Olympics. Manchukuo had a chance to participate in the planned 1940 Helsinki Olympics, but the onset of World War II prevented the games from taking place. Manchukuo instead sent athletes to compete at the 1940 East Asian Games in Tokyo organised by the Japanese Empire, as a replacement for the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics.

=== Stamps and postal history ===
Manchukuo issued postage stamps from 28 July 1932 until its dissolution following the surrender of the Empire of Japan in August 1945. The last issue of Manchukuo was on 2 May 1945.

<text>In computer science, denotational semantics (initially known as mathematical semantics or Scott–Strachey semantics) is an approach of formalizing the meanings of programming languages by constructing mathematical objects (called &quot;denotations&quot;) that describe the meanings of expressions from the languages. Other approaches providing formal semantics of programming languages include axiomatic semantics and operational semantics.

Broadly speaking, denotational semantics is concerned with finding mathematical objects called domains that represent what programs do. For example, programs (or program phrases) might be represented by partial functions or by games between the environment and the system.

An important tenet of denotational semantics is that &quot;semantics should be compositional&quot;: the denotation of a program phrase should be built out of the denotations of its subphrases.

==Historical development==
Denotational semantics originated in the work of Christopher Strachey and Dana Scott published in the early 1970s. As originally developed by Strachey and Scott, denotational semantics provided the meaning of a computer program as a function that mapped input into output. To give meanings to recursively defined programs, Scott proposed working with continuous functions between domains, specifically complete partial orders. As described below, work has continued in investigating appropriate denotational semantics for aspects of programming languages such as sequentiality, concurrency, non-determinism and local state.

Denotational semantics has been developed for modern programming languages that use capabilities like concurrency and exceptions, e.g., Concurrent ML, CSP, and Haskell. The semantics of these languages is compositional in that the meaning of a phrase depends on the meanings of its subphrases. For example, the meaning of the applicative expression codice_1 is defined in terms of semantics of its subphrases f, E1 and E2. In a modern programming language, E1 and E2 can be evaluated concurrently and the execution of one of them might affect the other by interacting through shared objects causing their meanings to be defined in terms of each other. Also, E1 or E2 might throw an exception which could terminate the execution of the other one. The sections below describe special cases of the semantics of these modern programming languages.

===Meanings of recursive programs===
Denotational semantics is ascribed to a program phrase as a function from an environment (holding current values of its free variables) to its denotation. For example, the phrase produces a denotation when provided with an environment that has binding for its two free variables: and . If in the environment has the value 3 and has the value 5, then the denotation is 15.

A function can be represented as a set of ordered pairs of argument and corresponding result values. For example, the set {(0,1), (4,3)} denotes a function with result 1 for argument 0, result 3 for the argument 4, and undefined otherwise.

Consider for example the factorial function, which might be defined recursively as:
int factorial(int n) { if (n == 0) then return 1; else return n * factorial(n-1); }

To provide a meaning for this recursive definition, the denotation is built up as the limit of approximations, where each approximation limits the number of calls to factorial. At the beginning, we start with no calls - hence nothing is defined. In the next approximation, we can add the ordered pair (0,1), because this doesn&#x27;t require calling factorial again. Similarly we can add (1,1), (2,2), etc., adding one pair each successive approximation because computing &quot;factorial(n)&quot; requires &quot;n+1&quot; calls. In the limit we get a total function from formula_1 to formula_1 defined everywhere in its domain.

Formally we model each approximation as a partial function formula_3. Our approximation is then repeatedly applying a function implementing &quot;make a more defined partial factorial function&quot;, i.e. formula_4, starting with the empty function (empty set). &quot;F&quot; could be defined in code as follows (using codice_2 for formula_3):

int factorial_nonrecursive(Map&lt;int,int&gt; factorial_less_defined, int n)
 if (n == 0) then return 1;
 else if (fprev = lookup(factorial_less_defined, n-1)) then
 return n * fprev;
 else
 return NOT_DEFINED;

Map&lt;int,int&gt; F(Map&lt;int,int&gt; factorial_less_defined)
 Map&lt;int,int&gt; new_factorial = Map.empty();
 for (int n in all&lt;int&gt;()) {
 if (f = factorial_nonrecursive(factorial_less_defined, n) != NOT_DEFINED)
 new_factorial.put(n, f);
 return new_factorial;


Then we can introduce the notation &quot;Fn&quot; to indicate &quot;F&quot; applied &quot;n&quot; times.
* &quot;F&quot;0({}) is the totally undefined partial function, represented as the set {};
* &quot;F&quot;1({}) is the partial function represented as the set {(0,1)}: it is defined at 0, to be 1, and undefined elsewhere;
* &quot;F&quot;5({}) is the partial function represented as the set {(0,1), (1,1), (2,2), (3,6), (4,24)}: it is defined for arguments 0,1,2,3,4.

This iterative process builds a sequence of partial functions from formula_1 to formula_1. Partial functions form a chain-complete partial order using ⊆ as the ordering. Furthermore, this iterative process of better approximations of the factorial function forms an expansive (also called progressive) mapping because each formula_8 using ⊆ as the ordering. So by a fixed-point theorem (specifically Bourbaki–Witt theorem), there exists a fixed point for this iterative process.

In this case, the fixed point is the least upper bound of this chain, which is the full function, which can be expressed as the union
:formula_9

The fixed point we found is the least fixed point of &quot;F&quot;, because our iteration started with the smallest element in the domain (the empty set). To prove this we need a more complex fixed point theorem such as the Knaster–Tarski theorem.

===Denotational semantics of non-deterministic programs===
The concept of power domains has been developed to give a denotational semantics to non-deterministic sequential programs. Writing &quot;P&quot; for a power-domain constructor, the domain &quot;P&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) is the domain of non-deterministic computations of type denoted by &quot;D&quot;.

There are difficulties with fairness and unboundedness in domain-theoretic models of non-determinism.

===Denotational semantics of concurrency===
Many researchers have argued that the domain-theoretic models given above do not suffice for the more general case of concurrent computation. For this reason various new models have been introduced. In the early 1980s, people began using the style of denotational semantics to give semantics for concurrent languages. Examples include Will Clinger&#x27;s work with the actor model; Glynn Winskel&#x27;s work with event structures and Petri nets; and the work by Francez, Hoare, Lehmann, and de Roever (1979) on trace semantics for CSP. All these lines of inquiry remain under investigation (see e.g. the various denotational models for CSP).

Recently, Winskel and others have proposed the category of profunctors as a domain theory for concurrency.

===Denotational semantics of state===
State (such as a heap) and simple imperative features can be straightforwardly modeled in the denotational semantics described above. The key idea is to consider a command as a partial function on some domain of states. The meaning of &quot; is then the function that takes a state to the state with assigned to . The sequencing operator &quot; is denoted by composition of functions. Fixed-point constructions are then used to give a semantics to looping constructs, such as &quot;&quot;.

Things become more difficult in modelling programs with local variables. One approach is to no longer work with domains, but instead to interpret types as functors from some category of worlds to a category of domains. Programs are then denoted by natural continuous functions between these functors.

===Denotations of data types===
Many programming languages allow users to define recursive data types. For example, the type of lists of numbers can be specified by
datatype list = Cons of nat * list | Empty
This section deals only with functional data structures that cannot change. Conventional imperative programming languages would typically allow the elements of such a recursive list to be changed.

For another example: the type of denotations of the untyped lambda calculus is
datatype D = D of (D → D)
The problem of &quot;solving domain equations&quot; is concerned with finding domains that model these kinds of datatypes. One approach, roughly speaking, is to consider the collection of all domains as a domain itself, and then solve the recursive definition there.

Polymorphic data types are data types that are defined with a parameter. For example, the type of α s is defined by
datatype α list = Cons of α * α list | Empty
Lists of natural numbers, then, are of type , while lists of strings are of .

Some researchers have developed domain theoretic models of polymorphism. Other researchers have also modeled parametric polymorphism within constructive set theories.

A recent research area has involved denotational semantics for object and class based programming languages.

===Denotational semantics for programs of restricted complexity===
Following the development of programming languages based on linear logic, denotational semantics have been given to languages for linear usage (see e.g. proof nets, coherence spaces) and also polynomial time complexity.

===Denotational semantics of sequentiality===
The problem of full abstraction for the sequential programming language PCF was, for a long time, a big open question in denotational semantics. The difficulty with PCF is that it is a very sequential language. For example, there is no way to define the parallel-or function in PCF. It is for this reason that the approach using domains, as introduced above, yields a denotational semantics that is not fully abstract.

This open question was mostly resolved in the 1990s with the development of game semantics and also with techniques involving logical relations. For more details, see the page on PCF.

===Denotational semantics as source-to-source translation===
It is often useful to translate one programming language into another. For example, a concurrent programming language might be translated into a process calculus; a high-level programming language might be translated into byte-code. (Indeed, conventional denotational semantics can be seen as the interpretation of programming languages into the internal language of the category of domains.)

In this context, notions from denotational semantics, such as full abstraction, help to satisfy security concerns.

==Abstraction==
It is often considered important to connect denotational semantics with operational semantics. This is especially important when the denotational semantics is rather mathematical and abstract, and the operational semantics is more concrete or closer to the computational intuitions. The following properties of a denotational semantics are often of interest.
#Syntax independence: The denotations of programs should not involve the syntax of the source language.
#Adequacy (or soundness): All observably distinct programs have distinct denotations;
#Full abstraction: All observationally equivalent programs have equal denotations.

For semantics in the traditional style, adequacy and full abstraction may be understood roughly as the requirement that &quot;operational equivalence coincides with denotational equality&quot;. For denotational semantics in more intensional models, such as the actor model and process calculi, there are different notions of equivalence within each model, and so the concepts of adequacy and of full abstraction are a matter of debate, and harder to pin down. Also the mathematical structure of operational semantics and denotational semantics can become very close.

Additional desirable properties we may wish to hold between operational and denotational semantics are:
#Constructivism: Constructivism is concerned with whether domain elements can be shown to exist by constructive methods.
#Independence of denotational and operational semantics: The denotational semantics should be formalized using mathematical structures that are independent of the operational semantics of a programming language; However, the underlying concepts can be closely related. See the section on Compositionality below.
#Full completeness or definability: Every morphism of the semantic model should be the denotation of a program.

==Compositionality==
An important aspect of denotational semantics of programming languages is compositionality, by which the denotation of a program is constructed from denotations of its parts. For example, consider the expression &quot;7 + 4&quot;. Compositionality in this case is to provide a meaning for &quot;7 + 4&quot; in terms of the meanings of &quot;7&quot;, &quot;4&quot; and &quot;+&quot;.

A basic denotational semantics in domain theory is compositional because it is given as follows. We start by considering program fragments, i.e. programs with free variables. A &quot;typing context&quot; assigns a type to each free variable. For instance, in the expression (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;) might be considered in a typing context (&quot;x&quot;:,&quot;y&quot;:). We now give a denotational semantics to program fragments, using the following scheme.
#We begin by describing the meaning of the types of our language: the meaning of each type must be a domain. We write 〚τ〛 for the domain denoting the type τ. For instance, the meaning of type should be the domain of natural numbers: 〚〛= formula_1⊥.
#From the meaning of types we derive a meaning for typing contexts. We set 〚 &quot;x&quot;1:τ1..., &quot;x&quot;n:τn〛 = 〚 τ1〛× ... ×〚τn〛. For instance, 〚&quot;x&quot;:,&quot;y&quot;:〛= formula_1⊥×formula_1⊥. As a special case, the meaning of the empty typing context, with no variables, is the domain with one element, denoted 1.
#Finally, we must give a meaning to each program-fragment-in-typing-context. Suppose that &quot;P&quot; is a program fragment of type σ, in typing context Γ, often written Γ⊢&quot;P&quot;:σ. Then the meaning of this program-in-typing-context must be a continuous function 〚Γ⊢&quot;P&quot;:σ〛:〚Γ〛→〚σ〛. For instance, 〚⊢7:〛:1→formula_1⊥ is the constantly &quot;7&quot; function, while 〚&quot;x&quot;:,&quot;y&quot;:⊢&quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot;:〛:formula_1⊥×formula_1⊥→formula_1⊥ is the function that adds two numbers.

Now, the meaning of the compound expression (7+4) is determined by composing the three functions 〚⊢7:〛:1→formula_1⊥, 〚⊢4:〛:1→formula_1⊥, and 〚&quot;x&quot;:,&quot;y&quot;:⊢&quot;x&quot;+&quot;y&quot;:〛:formula_1⊥×formula_1⊥→formula_1⊥.

In fact, this is a general scheme for compositional denotational semantics. There is nothing specific about domains and continuous functions here. One can work with a different category instead. For example, in game semantics, the category of games has games as objects and strategies as morphisms: we can interpret types as games, and programs as strategies. For a simple language without general recursion, we can make do with the category of sets and functions. For a language with side-effects, we can work in the Kleisli category for a monad. For a language with state, we can work in a functor category. Milner has advocated modelling location and interaction by working in a category with interfaces as objects and &quot;bigraphs&quot; as morphisms.

==Semantics versus implementation==
According to Dana Scott (1980):
:&quot;It is not necessary for the semantics to determine an implementation, but it should provide criteria for showing that an implementation is correct.&quot;

According to Clinger (1981):
:&quot;Usually, however, the formal semantics of a conventional sequential programming language may itself be interpreted to provide an (inefficient) implementation of the language. A formal semantics need not always provide such an implementation, though, and to believe that semantics must provide an implementation leads to confusion about the formal semantics of concurrent languages. Such confusion is painfully evident when the presence of unbounded nondeterminism in a programming language&#x27;s semantics is said to imply that the programming language cannot be implemented.&quot;

==Connections to other areas of computer science==
Some work in denotational semantics has interpreted types as domains in the sense of domain theory, which can be seen as a branch of model theory, leading to connections with type theory and category theory. Within computer science, there are connections with abstract interpretation, program verification, and model checking.

<doc id="55278" wikidata="Q81397" url="?curid=55278" title="Warp drive">
<text>A warp drive or a drive enabling space warp is a fictional superluminal (faster than the speed of light) spacecraft propulsion system in many science fiction works, most notably &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and a subject of ongoing real-life physics research. The general concept of &quot;warp drive&quot; was introduced by John W. Campbell in his 1957 novel &quot;Islands of Space&quot; and was popularized by the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. Its closest real-life equivalent is the Alcubierre drive, a theoretical solution of the field equations of general relativity.

== History and characteristics ==
Warp drive, or a drive enabling space warp, is one of several ways of travelling through space found in science fiction. It has been often discussed as being conceptually similar to hyperspace. A warp drive is a device that distorts the shape of the space-time continuum. A spacecraft equipped with a warp drive may travel at speeds greater than that of light by many orders of magnitude. In contrast to some other fictitious faster-than-light technologies such as a jump drive, the warp drive does not permit instantaneous travel and transfers between two points, but rather involves a measurable passage of time which is pertinent to the concept. In contrast to hyperspace, spacecraft at warp velocity would continue to interact with objects in &quot;normal space&quot;.

The general concept of warp drive was introduced by John W. Campbell in his 1957 novel &quot;Islands of Space.&quot; &quot;Brave New Words&quot; gave the earliest example of the term &quot;space-warp drive&quot; as Fredric Brown&#x27;s &quot;Gateway to Darkness&quot; (1949), and also cited an unnamed story from &quot;Cosmic Stories&quot; (May 1941) as using the word &quot;warp&quot; in the context of space travel, although the usage of this term as a &quot;bend or curvature&quot; in space which facilitates travel can be traced to several works as far back as the mid-1930s, for example Jack Williamson&#x27;s &quot;The Cometeers&quot; (1936).

== Einstein&#x27;s space warp and real-world physics ==

Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity states that speed of light travel is impossible for material objects that, unlike photons, have a non-zero rest mass. The problem of a material object exceeding light speed is that an infinite amount of kinetic energy would be required to travel at exactly the speed of light. Warp drives are one of the science-fiction tropes that serve to circumvent this limitation in fiction to facilitate stories set at galactic scales. However, the concept of space warp has been criticized as &quot;illogical&quot;, and has been connected to several other rubber science ideas that do not fit into our current understanding of physics, such as the transporters and replicators in Star Trek, antigravity or negative mass.

Some argue that these effects mean that although it&#x27;s not possible to travel faster than the speed of light, both space and time &quot;warp&quot; to allow travelling the distance of one light year, in less than a year. Although it is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light, the effective speed is faster than light. This warping of space and time is precisely mathematically specified by the Lorentz factor, which depends on velocity. Although only theoretical when published over 100 years ago, the effect has since been measured and confirmed many times. In the limit, at light speed time stops completely (relative to a certain reference frame) and it is possible to travel infinite distances across space with no passage of time. 

The solution to Einstein’s field equations proposed by Alcubierre defines a spacetime metric—known as the Alcubierre metric—where spacetime itself is distorted in a controlled manner. The metric creates a region of compressed spacetime in front of the spacecraft and expanded spacetime behind it, forming a &quot;warp bubble.&quot; The spacecraft resides within this bubble, moving with the local spacetime without experiencing relativistic time dilation or violating causality.

Mathematically, the Alcubierre metric is expressed as:

formula_1

where:

* formula_2 is the speed of the warp bubble,
* formula_3 is a shape function that determines the smoothness and size of the bubble,
* formula_4is the radial distance from the spacecraft center.

The creation of such a bubble requires exotic matter—substances with negative energy density (a violation of the Weak Energy Condition). Casimir effect experiments have hinted at the existence of negative energy in quantum fields, but practical production at the required scale remains speculative.

Similarly, a quantum drive might utilize quantum field theory to exploit vacuum energy, leveraging phenomena such as the zero-point energy of the quantum vacuum. The drive could theoretically manipulate virtual particle pairs or create localized energy gradients via quantum entanglement. The energy density of the quantum vacuum, often estimated as 10113J/m3 in the context of quantum field fluctuations, could provide immense power if harnessed effectively.

Although the concept of warp drive has originated in fiction, it has received some scientific consideration, most notably related to the 1990s concept of the Alcubierre drive. Alcubierre stated in an email to William Shatner that his theory was directly inspired by the term used in the TV series &quot;Star Trek&quot; and cites the &quot;&#x27;warp drive&#x27; of science fiction&quot; in his 1994 article.

In 2021, DARPA-funded researcher Harold White, of the Limitless Space Institute, claimed that he had succeeded in creating a real warp bubble, saying &quot;our detailed numerical analysis of our custom Casimir cavities helped us identify a real and manufacturable nano/microstructure that is predicted to generate a negative vacuum energy density such that it would manifest a real nanoscale warp bubble, not an analog, but the real thing.&quot;

== &quot;Star Trek&quot; ==


Warp drive is one of the fundamental features of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise and one of the best-known examples of space warp (warp drive) in fiction. In the first pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, &quot;The Cage&quot;, it is referred to as a &quot;hyperdrive&quot;, with Captain Pike stating the speed to reach planet TalosIV as &quot;time warp, factor 7&quot;. The warp drive in Star Trek is one of the most detailed fictional technologies. Compared to the hyperspace drives of other fictional universes, it differs in that a spaceship does not leave the normal space-time continuum and instead the space-time itself is distorted, as is made possible in the general theory of relativity.

The basic functional principle of the warp drive in &quot;Star Trek&quot; is the same for all spaceships. A strong energy source, usually a so-called&quot; warp core&quot; or sometimes called &quot;intermix chamber&quot;, generates a high-energy plasma. This plasma is transported to the so-called &quot;warp field generators&quot; via lines that are reminiscent of pipes. These generators are basically coils in &quot;warp nacelles&quot; protruding from the spaceship. These generate a subspace field, the so-called &quot;warp field&quot; or a &quot;warp bubble&quot;, which distort space-time and propels the bubble and spaceship in the bubble forward.

The warp core can be designed in various forms. Humans and most of the other fictional races use a moderated reaction of antimatter and matter. The energy produced passes through a matrix, which is made of a fictional chemical element, called dilithium. However, other species are shown to use different methods for faster-than-light propulsion. The Romulans, for example, use artificial micro-black holes called &quot;quantum singularities&quot;.

The speeds are given in warp factors and follow a geometric progression. The first scale developed by Franz Joseph was simply a cubic progression with no limit. This leads to the use of ever growing warp factors in the &quot;Original Series&quot; and the &quot;Animated Series&quot;. For example, warp 14.1 in the TOS-episode &quot;That Which Survives&quot; or warp 36 in the TAS-episode &quot;The Counter-Clock Incident&quot;. In order to focus more on the story and away from the technobabble, Gene Roddenberry commissioned Michael Okuda to invent a revised warp scale. Warp 10 should be the absolute limit and stand for infinite speed. In homage to Gene Roddenberry, this limit was also called &quot;Eugene&#x27;s Limit&quot;. Okuda explains this in an author&#x27;s comment in his technical manual for the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. Between Warp 1 (the speed of light) and Warp 9, the increase was still roughly geometric, but the exponent was adjusted so that the speeds were higher compared to the old scale. For instance, Warp 9 is more than 1500 times faster than Warp 1 in comparison to the 729 times (nine to the power of 3) calculated using the original cubic formula. In the same author&#x27;s comment, Okuda explains that the motivation was to fulfill fan expectations that the new Enterprise is much faster than the original, but without changing the warp factor numbers. Between Warp 9 and Warp 10, the new scale grows exponentially. Only in a single episode of &quot;Star Trek Voyager&quot; there was a specific numerical speed value given for a warp factor. In the episode &quot;The 37&#x27;s&quot;, Tom Paris tells Amelia Earhart that Warp 9.9 is about 4 billion miles per second (using customary units for the character&#x27;s benefit). That is more than 14 times the value of Warp 9 and equal to around 21,400 times speed of light. However, this statement contradicts the technical manuals and encyclopedias written by Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda, where a speed of 3053 times the speed of light was established for a warp factor of 9.9 and a speed of 7912 times the speed of light for a warp factor of 9.99. Both numerical values are well below the value given by Tom Paris.

In the episode &quot;Vis à Vis&quot;, a &quot;coaxial warp drive&quot; is mentioned. The working principle is explained in more detail in the &quot;Star Trek Encyclopedia&quot;. This variant of a warp drive uses spatial folding instead of a warp field and allows an instant movement with nearly infinite velocity.

&quot;Star Trek&quot; has also introduced a so-called &quot;Transwarp&quot; concept, but without a fixed definition. It is effectively a catch-all phrase for any and all technologies and natural phenomena that enable speeds above Warp 9.99.

Rick Sternbach described the basic idea in the Technical Manual: &quot;Finally, we had to provide some loophole for various powerful aliens like Q, who have a knack for tossing the ship million of light years in the time of a commercial break. [...] This lets Q and his friends have fun in the 9.9999+ range, but also lets our ship travel slowly enough to keep the galaxy a big place, and meets the other criteria.&quot;

<doc id="55279" wikidata="Q277579" url="?curid=55279" title="James Dewar">
<text>Sir James Dewar ( ; 20 September 1842 – 27 March 1923) was a Scottish chemist and physicist. He is best known for his invention of the vacuum flask, which he used in conjunction with research into the liquefaction of gases. He also studied atomic and molecular spectroscopy, working in these fields for more than 25 years. Dewar was nominated for the Nobel Prize 8 times — 5 times in Physics and 3 times in Chemistry — but he was never so honoured.

==Early life==
James Dewar was born in Kincardine, Perthshire (now in Fife) in 1842, the youngest of six boys of Ann Dewar and Thomas Dewar, a vintner. He was educated at Kincardine Parish School and then Dollar Academy. His parents died when he was 15. He attended the University of Edinburgh where he studied chemistry under Lyon Playfair (later Baron Playfair), becoming Playfair&#x27;s personal assistant. Dewar also studied under August Kekulé at Ghent.

==Career==
In 1875, Dewar was elected Jacksonian professor of natural experimental philosophy at the University of Cambridge, becoming a member of Peterhouse. He became a member of the Royal Institution and later, in 1877, replaced Dr John Hall Gladstone in the role of Fullerian Professor of Chemistry. Dewar was also the President of the Chemical Society in 1897 and the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1902, as well as serving on the Royal Commission established to examine London&#x27;s water supply from 1893 to 1894 and the Committee on Explosives. While serving on the Committee on Explosives, he and Frederick Augustus Abel developed cordite, a smokeless gunpowder alternative.

In 1867 Dewar described several chemical formulas for benzene, which were published in 1869. One of the formulae, which does not represent benzene correctly and was not advocated by Dewar, is sometimes still called Dewar benzene. In 1869 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being his former mentor, Lyon Playfair.

His scientific work covers a wide field – his earlier papers cover topics including organic chemistry, hydrogen and its physical constants, high-temperature research, the temperature of the Sun and of the electric spark, spectrophotometry, and the chemistry of the electric arc.

With Professor J. G. McKendrick, of the University of Glasgow, he investigated the physiological action of light and examined the changes that take place in the electrical condition of the retina under its influence. With Professor G. D. Liveing, one of his colleagues at the University of Cambridge, he began in 1878 a long series of spectroscopic observations, the later of which were devoted to the spectroscopic examination of various gaseous elements separated from atmospheric air by the aid of low temperatures. He was joined by Professor J. A. Fleming, of University College London, in the investigation of the electrical behaviour of substances cooled to very low temperatures.

His name is most widely known in connection with his work on the liquefaction of the so-called permanent gases and his researches at temperatures approaching absolute zero. His interest in this branch of physics and chemistry dates back at least as far as 1874, when he discussed the &quot;Latent Heat of Liquid Gases&quot; before the British Association. In 1878, he devoted a Friday evening lecture at the Royal Institution to the then-recent work of Louis Paul Cailletet and Raoul Pictet, and exhibited for the first time in Great Britain the working of the Cailletet apparatus. Six years later, again at the Royal Institution, he described the researches of Zygmunt Florenty Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski, and illustrated for the first time in public the liquefaction of oxygen and air. Soon afterward, he built a machine from which the liquefied gas could be drawn off through a valve for use as a cooling agent, before using the liquid oxygen in research work related to meteorites; about the same time, he also obtained oxygen in the solid state.

By 1891, he had designed and built, at the Royal Institution, machinery which yielded liquid oxygen in industrial quantities, and towards the end of that year, he showed that both liquid oxygen and liquid ozone are strongly attracted by a magnet. About 1892, the idea occurred to him of using vacuum-jacketed vessels for the storage of liquid gases – the Dewar flask (otherwise known as a Thermos or vacuum flask) – the invention for which he became most famous. The vacuum flask was so efficient at keeping heat out, it was found possible to preserve the liquids for comparatively long periods, making an examination of their optical properties possible. Dewar did not profit from the widespread adoption of his vacuum flask – he lost a court case against Thermos concerning the patent for his invention. While Dewar was recognised as the inventor, because he did not patent his invention, there was no way to prevent Thermos from using his design.

He next experimented with a high-pressure hydrogen jet by which low temperatures were realised through the Joule–Thomson effect, and the successful results he obtained led him to build at the Royal Institution a large regenerative cooling refrigerating machine. Using this machine in 1898, liquid hydrogen was collected for the first time, solid hydrogen following in 1899. He tried to liquefy the last remaining gas, helium, which condenses into a liquid at −268.9 °C, but owing to a number of factors, including a short supply of helium, Dewar was preceded by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes as the first person to produce liquid helium, in 1908. Onnes would later be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his research into the properties of matter at low temperatures – Dewar was nominated several times, but never succeeded in winning the Nobel Prize.

In 1905, he began to investigate the gas-absorbing powers of charcoal when cooled to low temperatures and applied his research to the creation of high vacuum, which was used for further experiments in atomic physics. Dewar continued his research work into the properties of elements at low temperatures, specifically low-temperature calorimetry, until the outbreak of World War I. The Royal Institution laboratories lost a number of staff to the war effort, both in fighting and scientific roles, and after the war, Dewar had little interest in restarting the serious research work that went on before the war. Shortages of scholars necessarily compounded the problems. His research during and after the war mainly involved investigating surface tension in soap bubbles, rather than further work into the properties of matter at low temperatures.

==Later life==

Dewar died on 27 March 1923 aged 80 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in London. An urn with his ashes still resides there.

==Family==
He married Helen Rose Banks in 1871. They had no children. Helen was sister-in-law to both Charles Dickson, Lord Dickson and James Douglas Hamilton Dickson.

Dewar&#x27;s nephew, Dr Thomas William Dewar FRSE, was an amateur artist, who painted a portrait of Sir James Dewar. He is presumably also the same Thomas William Dewar who was mentioned as executor in James Dewar&#x27;s will, ultimately replaced &quot;unopposed&quot; by Dewar&#x27;s wife.

==Royal Institution Christmas Lectures==
Dewar was invited to deliver several Royal Institution Christmas Lectures:
:&quot;A Soap Bubble&quot; (1878)
:&quot;Atoms&quot; (1880)
:&quot;Alchemy in Relation to Modern Science&quot; (1883)
:&quot;The Story of a Meteorite&quot; (1885)
:&quot;The Chemistry of Light and Photography&quot; (1886)
:&quot;Clouds and Cloudland&quot; (1888)
:&quot;Frost and Fire&quot; (1890)
:&quot;Air: Gaseous and Liquid&quot; (1893)
:&quot;Christmas Lecture Epilogues&quot; (1912)

==Honours and awards==
Whilst Dewar was never recognised by the Swedish Academy, he was recognised by many other institutions both before and after his death, in Britain and overseas. The Royal Society elected him a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1877 and bestowed their Rumford (1894), Davy (1909), and Copley Medal (1916) medals upon him for his work, as well as inviting him to deliver their Bakerian Lecture in 1901. In 1899, he became the first recipient of the Hodgkins gold medal of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, for his contributions to knowledge of the nature and properties of atmospheric air. That same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1907.

He was President of the Society of Chemical Industry from 1887-88.

In 1904, he was the first British subject to receive the Lavoisier Medal of the French Academy of Sciences, and in 1906, he was the first to be awarded the Matteucci Medal of the Italian Society of Sciences. He was knighted in 1904 and awarded the Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize for 1900–1904 by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1908, he was awarded the Albert Medal of The Society of Arts. A lunar crater was named in his honour.

A street within the Kings Buildings complex of the University of Edinburgh was named in memory of Dewar in the early 21st century.

==Character==

Dewar&#x27;s irascibility was legendary. Rowlinson (2012) called him &quot;ruthless&quot;, particularly with his colleague Siegfried Ruhemann.

<text>The Canning Stock Route is a track that runs from Halls Creek in the Kimberley region of Western Australia to Wiluna in the mid-west region. With a total distance of around 1,850 km (1,150 mi) it is claimed to be the longest historic stock route in the world.

A 1928 Royal Commission into the price of beef in Western Australia led to the repair of the wells and the re-opening of the stock route. Around 20 droves took place between 1931 and 1959 when the final droving run was completed.

The Canning Stock Route is now a popular but challenging four-wheel drive trek typically taking 10 to 20 days to complete. A few adventurers have traversed the track on foot, by bicycle, motorcycle and in two-wheel drive vehicles.

There are two small settlements on the track where fuel and other supplies may be obtained; Kunawarritji, approximately north of Wiluna, and Billiluna, south of Halls Creek.

In March 2020, the route was closed to tourists due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was reopened on 14 June 2022.

==History==

In Western Australia at the beginning of the 20th century, east Kimberley cattlemen were looking for a way to traverse the western deserts of Australia with their cattle as a way to break a west Kimberley monopoly that controlled the supply of beef to Perth and the goldfields in the south of the state. East Kimberley cattle were infested with Boophilus ticks infected with a malaria-like parasitic disease called Babesiosis and were prohibited from being transported to southern markets by sea due to a fear that the ticks would survive the journey and spread. This gave west Kimberley cattlemen a monopoly on the beef trade and resulted in high prices.

With east Kimberley cattlemen keen to find a way to get their cattle to market, and the Government of Western Australia keen for competition to bring prices down, a 1905 proposal of a stock route through the desert was taken seriously. James Isdell, an east Kimberley pastoralist and member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, proposed the stock route arguing that ticks would not survive in the dry desert climate on the trip south.

===Surveying the route===

====Calvert and Carnegie expeditions====
The route, which crossed the territories of nine different Aboriginal language groups, had been explored previously in 1896 by the Calvert Expedition led by Lawrence Wells and again later that year by the Carnegie Expedition led by David Carnegie. Two members of the Calvert Expedition perished of thirst and the Carnegie Expedition suffered considerable hardships with camels dying after eating poisonous grass and a member of the party accidentally shooting himself dead. Carnegie investigated the possibility of a stock route and concluded that the route was &quot;too barren and destitute of vegetation&quot; and was impractical.

Wells and Carnegie both mistreated Aboriginals they encountered on their expeditions, including by tying them up and forcing them to find water. Carnegie is also believed to have fed them salt, and he was later publicly criticised for this. Evidence supports that Alfred Canning had read both the Calvert and Carnegie expedition accounts to find out about the country (both described the terrain as &quot;extremely difficult&quot;) and the use of Aboriginal people to find water, an example Canning followed during his own expedition.

====Canning survey====
After it was determined that ticks could not survive a desert crossing, the government endorsed James Isdell&#x27;s scheme and funded a survey to find a stock route that would cross the Great Sandy Desert, the Little Sandy Desert and the Gibson Desert. Alfred Canning, a surveyor with the Western Australian Department of Lands and Surveys, was appointed to survey the stock route.

Canning&#x27;s task was to find a route through 1850 kilometres of desert, from Wiluna in the mid west to the Kimberley in the north. He needed to find significant water sources – enough for up to 800 head of cattle, a day&#x27;s walk apart – where wells could be dug, and enough good grazing land to sustain this number of cattle during the journey south.

In 1906, with a team of 23 camels, two horses, and eight men, Canning surveyed the route completing the difficult journey from Wiluna to Halls Creek in less than six months. On 1 November 1906, shortly after arriving in Halls Creek, Canning sent a telegram to Perth stating that the finished route would &quot;be about the best watered stock route in [the] Colony&quot;. Canning was forced to delay his return journey because of an early wet season in the Kimberley that year. The survey party left Halls Creek in late January 1907 and arrived back in Wiluna in early July 1907. During the 14-month expedition, they had trekked about , relying on Aboriginal guides to help them find water.

Canning had always planned to rely on Aboriginal guides to help him find water and had taken neck chains and handcuffs supplied to him by the Wiluna police to make sure local &quot;guides&quot; stayed as long as he needed them. In order to gain assistance in locating water along the route, Canning captured several Martu men, chained them by the neck and forced them to lead his party to native water sources (soaks). As many soaks were sacred, the Martu may have misdirected the explorers away from these, resulting in the eventual stock route winding more than would otherwise have been necessary.

===Royal Commission into treatment of Aboriginal people===
After the Canning survey party returned to Perth, Canning&#x27;s use of Aboriginal guides came under scrutiny. The expedition&#x27;s cook, Edward Blake, accused Canning of mistreating many of the Aboriginal people they met during the survey expedition. Blake objected to the use of chains and criticised the &quot;party&#x27;s &#x27;immoral&#x27; pursuit of Aboriginal women, the theft and &#x27;unfair&#x27; trade of Aboriginal property and the destruction of native waters&quot;. Blake was concerned that the planned wells would prevent Aboriginal people accessing water.
Blake&#x27;s complaints led to a Royal Commission into the treatment of natives by the Canning exploration party.

Blake was unable to prove many of his claims, but Canning did admit to the use of chains. Kimberley explorer and the first Premier of Western Australia, John Forrest, dismissed Canning&#x27;s actions by claiming that all explorers behaved in this manner. Despite condemning the use of chains, the Royal Commission accepted the survey party&#x27;s actions as &quot;reasonable&quot; and Canning and his men were exonerated of all charges, including &quot;immorality with native women&quot; and stealing property. The Royal Commission approved the immediate commencement of the stock route&#x27;s construction. Canning was appointed to lead the construction party.

===Construction===
Canning left Perth in March 1908, along with 30 men, 70 camels, four wagons, 100 tonnes of food and equipment and 267 goats (for milk and meat), and travelled the route again to commence the construction of well heads and water troughs at the 54 water sources identified by his earlier expedition. He arrived back in Wiluna in April 1910 having completed the last of 48 wells and bringing the total cost of the route to £22000 (2010: A$2.6 million).

Thirty-seven of the wells were built on or near existing Aboriginal waters and were constructed in the European tradition, which made many of them inaccessible to Aboriginal people. Pulling the heavy buckets up from the bottom of the wells required the strength of three men or use of a camel. Consequently, many Aboriginal people were injured or died while trying to access the water, either falling in and drowning or breaking bones on the windlass handle. In reprisal, buckets were cut off or timber set on fire, and by 1917 Aboriginal people had vandalised or dismantled approximately half of the wells in a bid to reclaim access to the water or to prevent drovers from using the wells. Canning&#x27;s party had constructed the wells with the forced help of one of the Aboriginal peoples whose land the route traversed, the Martu.

Canning produced a detailed map of the stock route, Plan of Wiluna–Kimberley stock route exploration (showing positions of wells constructed 1908–9 and 10) on which he also recorded his observations of the land and water sources along the route. The map has become a symbol of Australia&#x27;s pioneering history.

===Using the stock route===

====First droving runs====
Commercial droving along the stock route began in 1910. The first few droves were of small groups of horses – the first started out with 42 horses of which only nine survived the journey.

The first mob of bullocks to attempt to use the stock route set out in January 1911; however, the party of three drovers, George Shoesmith, James Thompson and an Aboriginal stockman who was known as &quot;Chinaman&quot;, were killed by Aboriginals at Well 37. Thomas Cole discovered their bodies later in 1911 during his successful drove along the stock route. In September 1911, Sergeant R.H. Pilmer led a police &quot;punitive expedition&quot; to find the culprits and ensure the stock route remained open. The police made no arrests, but the expedition was considered a success after Pilmer acknowledged killing at least 10 Aboriginals.

On 7 September 1911 it was reported that the first mob of cattle to traverse the entire length of the stock route had successfully arrived in Wiluna. The cattle had apparently gained condition on the long drove.

The stock route was closed at some time prior to 1925. In 1925 the Billiluna Pastoral Company requested that it be reopened. The state government refused saying that it had fallen into disrepair from disuse as a result of stockmen being attacked by Aboriginals. The government claimed it would cost £5,625 and take six months to repair and refused to consider the expenditure at that time.

Despite police protection, drovers were afraid to use the track and it was rarely used for almost 20 years. Between 1911 and 1931, only eight mobs of cattle were driven along the Canning Stock Route.

====Reopening of the stock route====
A 1928 Royal Commission into the price of beef in Western Australia led to the re-opening of the stock route. In 1929, William Snell was commissioned to repair the wells and found that the only wells undamaged were the ones that Aboriginal people could use. Snell criticised the construction of Canning&#x27;s wells because they were difficult for Aboriginal people to use safely, and he put the destruction of the wells down to the anger and frustration people felt at being unable to access traditional water sources. Snell personally committed to making the wells more accessible to Aboriginal people:Natives cannot draw water from the Canning Stock Route wells. It takes three strong white men to land a bucket of water. It is beyond the natives power to land a bucket. They let go the handle [and] some times escape with their life but get an arm and head broken in the attempt to get away. To heal the wounds so severely inflicted and [as] a safeguard against the natives destroying the wells again I equipped the wells ... so that the native can draw water from the wells without destroying them.—William Snell

Snell started work on the refurbishment of the wells, fitting some with ladders for easier access, but he abandoned the work after well 35. Reports vary that he either ran out of materials or the desert became too much for him.

In 1930, Alfred Canning (then aged 70) was commissioned to complete the work. While Snell had encountered no hostility, Canning had trouble with the Aboriginals from the start but successfully completed the commission in 1931.

With these improvements, the route was used on a more regular basis although in total, it would only be used around 20 times between 1931 and 1959 when the last droving run was completed. None of the larger station owners used the track as it was found that only 600 head of cattle could be supported at a time, which was 200 less than was estimated when first completed. As Carnegie had accurately reported in 1896, the track was impractical for cattle drives.

During the Second World War the track was upgraded at considerable expense in case it was needed for an evacuation of the north if Australia was invaded. Including horse drives there were only 37 recorded drives between 1910 and the last run in 1959.

==Traverses==

In the 1950s horses became scarce in the Kimberley as widespread losses were caused by &quot;walkabout poison&quot;. This led to the stock route being used to drove horses north from around the Norseman area where they were sold to the stations. Wally Dowling, a drover who had made nine droves along the stock route took what was probably the last group of horses northwards along the route in September 1951.
In 1968 the entire length of the track was driven for the first time by surveyors Russell Wenholz and David Chudleigh, and Noel Kealley.

In 1972, before the route was regularly negotiated in four-wheel drives, ambitious attempts to complete it on foot took place. A New Zealander, Murray Rankin, and two English brothers, John and Peter Waterfall, fashioned homemade trolleys from bicycle wheels and metal tubing, and began their attempt starting from Wiluna in early June 1972. First John and then Peter turned back, but Rankin continued to Kumpupintil Lake, then called Lake Disappointment, before being forced to abandon the attempt. The remains of one of their trolleys lie north of well 15.

In 1973 Rankin tried again, this time starting from Old Halls Creek with Englishman John Foulsham. This time they had professionally built trolleys with motor-cycle wheels. The walk began on 1 June. Soon after reaching Godfrey&#x27;s Tank they were unable to pull the trolleys over the high sand hills. They left them and walked on to Lake Tobin and there abandoned the attempt and returned to Halls Creek.

Three years later, in 1976, Rankin achieved his ambition to walk the stock route. After driving the route in a Land Rover and establishing food depots along the way, he set out from Halls Creek on 12 July 1976 with three other bushwalkers, Ralph Barraclough, Kathy Burman and Rex Shaw. Barraclough turned back after becoming ill, but the others completed the journey in just under three months. 

In 1974, the first motorcycle crossing from Wiluna to Billiluna was achieved by Paul Allardyce, Colin Fitzgerald and Andy Bowman. They had air support flown by John Fitzgerald and Phil Schubert.

In 1977, the first commercial tour completed the drive.

During the 1980s fuel dumps were created and adventurous travellers became interested in the history of the track and the challenge to drive it.

In 1985, a Beach Buggy driven by Gordon Hayes, became the first two-wheel drive vehicle to complete the CSR under its own power. A support crew carried the fuel.

In 1991, a Citroën 2CV, driven by Rupert Backford and Mathew Rawlings, completed the CSR with a support crew towing the car over many of the dunes.

In 1993 long-distance walker Drew Kettle walked the route.

In 1997 Robin Rishworth cycled, with the aid of food drops, in just less than 27 days, and is considered to be the first modern day solo cyclist.

In 2004 Kate Leeming, as part of a longer trek, completed the route with the aid of a support vehicle.

In 2005 Jakub Postrzygacz became the first person to traverse the entire track without either support or the use of food drops, travelling alone by fatbike for 33 days. With large tyres and a single-wheel trailer, he carried all his food with him and replenished his water at wells.

In 2016 Sam Mitchell towed an array of solar panels behind his fatbike. This was the first time a solar powered vehicle traversed the complete length of the route.

===Tourism===

The Canning Stock route is considered one of the world&#x27;s great four-wheel drive adventures. Apart from keeping the track open, the route is not maintained. Some wells have been restored but others are in ruins and unusable. While quite a few travellers successfully make the trip, it still requires substantial planning and a convoy of well-equipped four-wheel drives or equivalent vehicles, and is only practical during the cooler months. Fuel drops typically need to be organised in advance and the trip will take two to three weeks. Fuel is now available at Kunawarritji Community near well 33 and Parnngurr Community near well 22.

The Kuju Wangka committee of the Yanunijarra Aboriginal Corporation closed the Canning Stock Route to tourists in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. They reopened it on 14 June 2022.

==Aboriginal perspective==
The history of the Canning Stock Route has been well documented from the colonial perspective – accounts of European explorers, drovers, prospectors and law enforcers – but increasingly the Aboriginal history of the track is also being recognised, and Aboriginal people are keen to have their story told.
Archaeologists now believe that the Western Desert has been occupied for around 30,000 years. For Aboriginal people, the history of the stock route is therefore part of a much older story. They have recorded this story, including the changes brought about by the construction of the stock route, through oral and artistic traditions.

The building of the stock route impacted on the cultural and social life of the more than 15 Aboriginal language groups that have a &quot;cultural, familial or historical connection to the route and its custodians, or to sites along the major Dreaming tracks or songlines&quot;. Some Dreaming tracks exist within the Country of a single language group, but others cross the territory of many groups and the major Dreaming tracks often mark the territorial boundaries of the Countries they cross. The stock route, and the people and stock it brought with it, inevitably interrupted traditional patterns of movement and connection to Country.

While many Aboriginal people made a determined effort to avoid contact with the people the stock route brought into their Country, the route became a path out of the desert for others. At different times, and for different reasons, people moved away to the outskirts of towns, to pastoral stations and church missions. Many found work with the drovers using the stock route and successful droves relied on the skill of these Aboriginal stockmen and women. Others left looking for more reliable sources of food and water, especially in times of drought, while some were drawn to the changes taking place around the edges of the desert or motivated by a desire to join family already living elsewhere.

===Rock art project===
There are a large number of Aboriginal rock paintings and carvings along the stock route. As more and more people visit the area each year, custodians of the Western Desert have become concerned about the protection and management of Aboriginal sites along the route. In 2007, researchers from the Australian National University began a project to draw up the first comprehensive plan of management for the entire Canning Stock Route. The project aimed to develop a series of modules to inform detailed guides and signs for visitors, while also protecting sites that have special significance for Indigenous peoples.

===The Canning Stock Route Project===
The Canning Stock Route has a strong connection to the story of Aboriginal art in the Western Desert. When droving along the stock route led to many family groups dispersing to the edges of the desert, communities were established in missions, towns, stations and settlements, and it was here that contemporary painting movements flourished.
In 2006, Western Australian independent cultural organisation Form instigated a contemporary arts and cultural initiative to &quot;explore the complex history of the Canning Stock Route through the prism of contemporary Aboriginal art&quot;. Partnerships among nine art centres and communities with direct connections to the stock route region were set up. The project involved several years of research by Form in collaboration with Aboriginal artists and their art centres and organisations.
A major part of the project&#x27;s program of bush work was a six-week, desert journey from Wiluna to Billiluna. During this trip, and in follow-up workshops and other trips, 80 artists created a collection of paintings, contemporary cultural objects and documentary material.

The historical and artistic value of the project was recognised in 2008 when the National Museum of Australia decided to acquire the entire Canning Stock Route Project collection.
The language groups identified during the project, as being crossed by the stock route, or adjacent to it are identified as:

:Manyjilyjarra
:Warnman
:Wangkajunga
:Nyangajarra
:Juwaliny

===The Canning Stock Route Collection===
The National Museum of Australia acquired a significant collection of artworks and other material collected by the 60 artists who travelled along the Canning Stock Route on a six-week return to country trip in 2007 as part of the Canning Stock Route Project. The Canning Stock Route collection includes over 100 works of art, 120 oral histories, historical research, social and cultural data, artists&#x27; biographies, 20,000 photographs and over 200 hours of film footage.

One of the key aims of the Canning Stock Route Project was the development of a travelling exhibition. The National Museum of Australia committed to assisting Form to develop an exhibition. &quot;Yiwarra Kuju (One Road) – The Canning Stock Route&quot;, a joint initiative between the National Museum of Australia and Form, was held at the museum from July 2010 to January 2011. The exhibition used works of art and stories to tell the story of the stock route&#x27;s impact on Aboriginal people from an Aboriginal perspective. When it closed in January 2011, &quot;Yiwarra Kuju – The Canning Stock Route&quot; had been the most successful exhibition in the history of the Museum, with over 120,000 visitors.

<text>A coat of arms is a heraldic visual design on an escutcheon (i.e., shield), surcoat, or tabard (the last two being outer garments). The coat of arms on an escutcheon forms the central element of the full heraldic achievement, which in its whole consists of a shield, supporters, a crest, and a motto. A coat of arms is traditionally unique to the armiger (e.g. an individual person, family, state, organization, school or corporation). The term &quot;coat of arms&quot; itself, describing in modern times just the heraldic design, originates from the description of the entire medieval chainmail &quot;surcoat&quot; garment used in combat or preparation for the latter.

Rolls of arms are collections of many coats of arms, and since the early Modern Age centuries, they have been a source of information for public showing and tracing the membership of a noble family, and therefore its genealogy across time.

==History==

Heraldic designs came into general use among European nobility in the 12th century. 
Systematic, heritable heraldry had developed by the beginning of the 13th century.
Exactly who had a right to use arms, by law or social convention, varied to some degree between countries. 
Early heraldic designs were personal, used by individual noblemen (who might also alter their chosen design over time).
Arms become hereditary by the end of the 12th century, in England by King Richard I during the Third Crusade (1189–1192).

Burgher arms were used in Northern Italy in the second half of the 14th century, and in the Holy Roman Empire
by the mid 14th century.
In the late medieval period, use of arms spread to the clergy, to towns as civic identifiers, and to royally chartered organizations such as universities and trading companies. 
The arts of vexillology and heraldry are closely related.

The term &quot;coat of arms&quot; itself in origin refers to the surcoat with heraldic designs worn by combatants, especially in the knightly tournament, in Old French &quot;&quot;. The sense is transferred to the heraldic design itself in Middle English, in the mid-14th century.

Despite no common, enforceable widespread regulation, heraldry has remained consistent across Europe, where tradition alone has governed the design and use of arms. Some nations, such as England and Scotland, still maintain the same heraldic authorities which have traditionally granted and regulated arms for centuries and continue to do so in the present day. In England, for example, the granting of arms is and has been controlled by the College of Arms. Unlike seals and other general emblems, heraldic &quot;achievements&quot; have a formal description called a blazon, which uses vocabulary that allows for consistency in heraldic depictions. In the present day, coats of arms are still in use by a variety of institutions and individuals: for example, many European cities and universities have guidelines on how their coats of arms may be used, and protect their use as trademarks as any other unique identifier might be. Many societies exist that also aid in the design and registration of personal arms.


Heraldry has been compared to modern corporate logos.

==Regional traditions==
=== French heraldry ===
The French system of heraldry greatly influenced the British and Western European systems. Much of the terminology and classifications are taken from it. However, with the fall of the French monarchy (and later Empire) there is not currently a &quot;Fons Honorum&quot; (power to dispense and control honors) to strictly enforce heraldic law. The French Republics that followed have either merely affirmed pre-existing titles and honors or vigorously opposed noble privilege. Coats of arms are considered an intellectual property of a family or municipal body. Assumed arms (arms invented and used by the holder rather than granted by an authority) are considered valid unless they can be proved in court to copy that of an earlier holder.

===British heraldry===
In the heraldic traditions of England and Scotland, an individual, rather than a family, had a coat of arms. In those traditions coats of arms are legal property transmitted from father to son; wives and daughters could also bear arms modified to indicate their relation to the current holder of the arms. Undifferenced arms are used only by one person at any given time. Other descendants of the original bearer could bear the ancestral arms only with some difference: usually a colour change or the addition of a distinguishing charge. One such charge is the label, which in British usage (outside the Royal Family) is now always the mark of an heir apparent or (in Scotland) an heir presumptive. Because of their importance in identification, particularly in seals on legal documents, the use of arms was strictly regulated; few countries continue in this today. This has been carried out by heralds and the study of coats of arms is therefore called &quot;heraldry&quot;. In time, the use of arms spread from military entities to educational institutes, and other establishments.

In Scotland, the Lord Lyon King of Arms has criminal jurisdiction to control the use of arms. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales the use of arms is a matter of civil law and regulated by the College of Arms and the High Court of Chivalry.

In reference to a dispute over the exercise of authority over the Officers of Arms in England, Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey, Lord Privy Seal, declared on 16 June 1673 that the powers of the Earl Marshal were &quot;to order, judge, and determine all matters touching arms, ensigns of nobility, honour, and chivalry; to make laws, ordinances, and statutes for the good government of the Officers of Arms; to nominate Officers to fill vacancies in the College of Arms; to punish and correct Officers of Arms for misbehaviour in the execution of their places&quot;. It was further declared that no patents of arms or any ensigns of nobility should be granted and no augmentation, alteration, or addition should be made to arms without the consent of the Earl Marshal.

=== Irish heraldry ===

In Ireland the usage and granting of coats of arms was strictly regulated by the Ulster King of Arms from the office&#x27;s creation in 1552. After Irish independence in 1922 the office was still functioning and working out of Dublin Castle. The last Ulster King of Arms was Sir Nevile Rodwell Wilkinson [Ulster King of Arms 1908–1940], who held it until his death in 1940. At the Irish government&#x27;s request, no new King of Arms was appointed. Thomas Ulick Sadleir, the Deputy Ulster King of Arms, then became the Acting Ulster King of Arms. He served until the office was merged with that of Norroy King of Arms in 1943 and stayed on until 1944 to clear up the backlog.An earlier Ireland King of Arms was created by King Richard II in 1392 and discontinued by King Henry VII in 1487. It did not grant many coats of arms – the few it did grant were annulled by the other Kings of Arms because they encroached upon their jurisdictions. Its purpose was supposedly to marshal an expedition to fully conquer Ireland that never materialized. Since 1 April 1943 the authority has been split between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Heraldry in the Republic of Ireland is regulated by the Government of Ireland, by the Genealogical Office through the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland. Heraldry in Northern Ireland is regulated by the British Government by the College of Arms through the Norroy and Ulster King of Arms.

=== German heraldry ===

The heraldic tradition and style of modern and historic Germany and the Holy Roman Empire – including national and civic arms, noble and burgher arms, ecclesiastical heraldry, heraldic displays, and heraldic descriptions – stand in contrast to Gallo-British, Latin and Eastern heraldry, and strongly influenced the styles and customs of heraldry in the Nordic countries, which developed comparatively late.

=== Scandinavian heraldry ===
In the Nordic countries, provinces, regions, cities, and municipalities have coats of arms. These are posted at the borders and on buildings containing official offices, as well as used in official documents and on the uniforms of municipal officers. Arms may also be used on souvenirs or other effects, given that an application has been granted by the municipal council.

=== Other national traditions ===

At a national level, &quot;coats of arms&quot; were generally retained by European states with constitutional continuity of more than a few centuries, including constitutional monarchies like Denmark as well as old republics like San Marino and Switzerland.

In Italy the use of coats of arms was only loosely regulated by the states existing before the unification of 1861. Since the Consulta Araldica, the college of arms of the Kingdom of Italy, was abolished in 1948, personal coats of arms and titles of nobility, though not outlawed, are not recognised.

Coats of arms in Spain were generally left up to the owner themselves, but the design was based on military service and the heritage of their grandparents. In France, the coat of arms is based on the Fleur-de-lys and the &quot;Rule of Tinctures&quot; used in English heraldry as well.

=== North American ===
====Canada====

The monarch of Canada&#x27;s prerogative to grant armorial bearings has been delegated to the Governor General of Canada. Canada has its own Chief Herald and Herald Chancellor. The Canadian Heraldic Authority, the governmental agency which is responsible for creating arms and promoting Canadian heraldry, is situated at Rideau Hall.

====United States====
The Great Seal of the United States uses on the obverse as its central motif a heraldic achievement described as being the arms of the nation. The seal, and the armorial bearings, were adopted by the Continental Congress on 20 June 1782, and is a shield divided palewise into thirteen pieces, with a blue chief, which is displayed upon the breast of an American bald eagle. The crest is thirteen stars breaking through a glory and clouds, displayed with no helm, torse, or mantling (unlike most European precedents at the time). Many of the American states have adopted their own coats of arms, which usually designed as part of the respective state&#x27;s seal. Vermont has both a state seal and a state coat of arms that are independent of one another (though both contain a pine tree, a cow and sheaves of grain); the seal is used to authenticate documents, whilst the heraldic device represents the state itself.

== Ecclesiastic heraldry ==


The Vatican City State and the Holy See each have their own coat of arms. As the papacy is not hereditary, its occupants display their personal arms combined with those of their office. Some popes came from armigerous (noble) families; others adopted coats of arms during their career in the Church. The latter typically allude to their ideal of life, or to specific pontifical programmes. A well-known and widely displayed example in recent times was Pope John Paul II&#x27;s arms. His selection of a large letter M (for the Virgin Mary) was intended to express the message of his strong Marian devotion. Roman Catholic dioceses are also each assigned a coat of arms, as are basilicas or papal churches, the latter usually displaying these on the building. These may be used in countries which otherwise do not use heraldic devices. In countries like Scotland with a strong statutory heraldic authority, arms will need to be officially granted and recorded.

== Flags and banners ==
Flags are used to identify ships (where they are called ensigns), embassies and such, and they use the same colors and designs found in heraldry, but they are not usually considered to be heraldic. A country may have both a national flag and a national coat of arms, and the two may not look alike at all. For example, the flag of Scotland (St Andrew&#x27;s Cross) has a white saltire on a blue field, but the royal arms of Scotland has a red lion within a double on a gold (or) field.

==Modern national emblems==

Among the states ruled by communist regimes, emblems resembling those of the Soviet states were adopted in all the Warsaw Pact states except Czechoslovakia and Poland. Since 1986–1989, some of the ex-Communist states, such as Russia, have reused their original pre-communist heraldry, often with only the symbols of monarchy removed. Other countries such as Belarus have retained their communist coats of arms or at least kept some of the old heraldry.

With the independence of the modern nation states of the Arab World from the First World War onwards, European traditions of heraldry were partially adopted for state emblems. These emblems often involve the star and crescent symbol taken from the Ottoman flag.
Other commonly seen symbols are birds, chiefly the Eagle of Saladin, and the Hawk of Quraish. These symbols can be found on the coat of arms of Egypt, and Syria, amongst others.

Sub-Saharan African flags and emblems after decolonisation often chose emblems based on regional traditions or wildlife. Symbols of a ritual significance according to local custom were generally favoured, such as the leopard in the arms of Benin, Malawi, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, in the form of the black panther, of Gabon.

In Kenya, the Swahili word Harambee (lit. &quot;Let us come together&quot;) is used as a motto in the country&#x27;s coat of arms. In Botswana and Lesotho, meanwhile, the word Pula (lit. &quot;Rain&quot;) is used in like fashion.

In the coat of arms of Eswatini, a lion and an elephant serve as supporters. They are each intended to represent the king and the queen mother respectively, the nation&#x27;s joint heads of state.

== Comparable traditions outside of Europe ==


Japanese emblems, called &quot;kamon&quot; (often abbreviated &quot;mon&quot;), are family badges which often date back to the 7th century, and are used in Japan today. The Japanese tradition is independent of the European, but many abstract and floral elements are used.

<doc id="55285" wikidata="Q93996" url="?curid=55285" title="Ernst Mach">
<text>Ernst Waldfried Josef Wenzel Mach ( ; ; 18 February 1838 – 19 February 1916) was an Austrian physicist and philosopher, who contributed to the understanding of the physics of shock waves. The ratio of the speed of a flow or object to that of sound is named the Mach number in his honour. As a philosopher of science, he was a major influence on logical positivism and American pragmatism. Through his criticism of Isaac Newton&#x27;s theories of space and time, he foreshadowed Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Mach was born in Chrlice (), Moravia, Austrian Empire (now part of Brno in the Czech Republic). His father Jan Nepomuk Mach, who had graduated from Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, acted as tutor to the noble Brethon family in Zlín in eastern Moravia. His grandfather, Wenzl Lanhaus, an administrator of the Chirlitz estate, was also master builder of the streets there. His activities in that field later influenced Ernst Mach&#x27;s theoretical work. Some sources give Mach&#x27;s birthplace as Tuřany (, also part of Brno), the site of the Chirlitz registry office. It was there that Mach was baptised by Peregrin Weiss. Mach later became a socialist and an atheist, but his theory and life was sometimes compared to Buddhism. Heinrich Gomperz called Mach the &quot;Buddha of Science&quot; because of his phenomenalist approach to the &quot;Ego&quot; in his &quot;Analysis of Sensations&quot;.

Up to the age of 14, Mach was educated at home by his parents. He then entered a gymnasium in Kroměříž (), where he studied for three years. In 1855 he became a student at the University of Vienna, where he studied physics and for one semester medical physiology, receiving his doctorate in physics in 1860 under Andreas von Ettingshausen with the thesis &quot;Über elektrische Ladungen und Induktion&quot;, and his habilitation the following year. His early work focused on the Doppler effect in optics and acoustics. 

=== Professional research ===
In 1864, Mach became professor of mathematics at the University of Graz after having declined a chair in surgery at the University of Salzburg. In 1866 he was appointed professor of physics. During this period, Mach continued his work in psycho-physics and in sensory perception. In 1867, he took the chair of experimental physics at the Charles-Ferdinand University, where he stayed for 28 years before returning to Vienna. In 1871 he was elected a member of the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences.

Mach&#x27;s main contribution to physics involved his description and photographs of spark shock-waves and then ballistic shock-waves. He described how when a bullet or shell moved faster than the speed of sound, it created a compression of air in front of it. Using schlieren photography, he and his son Ludwig photographed the shadows of the invisible shock waves. During the early 1890s Ludwig invented a modification of the Jamin interferometer that allowed for much clearer photographs. But Mach also made many contributions to psychology and physiology, including his anticipation of gestalt phenomena, his discovery of the oblique effect and of Mach bands, an inhibition-influenced type of visual illusion, and especially his discovery of a non-acoustic function of the inner ear that helps control human balance.

One of the best-known of Mach&#x27;s ideas is the so-called Mach principle, the physical origin of inertia. This was never written down by Mach, but was given a graphic verbal form, attributed by Philipp Frank to Mach: &quot;When the subway jerks, it&#x27;s the fixed stars that throw you down.&quot;


In 1900 Mach became the godfather of the physicist Wolfgang Ernst Pauli, who was also named after him.

Mach was also well known for his philosophy, developed in close interplay with his science. He defended a type of phenomenalism, recognizing only sensations as real. That position seemed incompatible with the view of atoms and molecules as external, mind-independent things. After an 1897 lecture by Ludwig Boltzmann at the Imperial Academy of Science in Vienna, Mach said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that atoms exist!&quot;

In 1898, Mach survived a paralytic stroke, and in 1901, he retired from the University of Vienna and was appointed to the upper chamber of the Austrian Parliament. On leaving Vienna in 1913, he moved to his son&#x27;s home in Vaterstetten, near Munich, where he continued writing and corresponding until his death in 1916, one day after his 78th birthday.

===Politics===
Born to a liberal family, Mach lamented that a &quot;very reactionary-clerical&quot; period followed the 1848 revolutions, prompting him to plan to emigrate to America.

In 1901, Mach accepted an appointment to the Austrian House of Lords but declined a nobility because he thought it inappropriate for a scientist to accept such a thing. He was on good personal terms with the Social Democrat politician Viktor Adler and left money in his will to the Social Democrat newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung.

Mach was critical of the European powers&#x27; colonial conquests, saying that they &quot;will constitute...the most distasteful chapter of history for coming generations&quot;.

==Physics==
Most of Mach&#x27;s initial studies in experimental physics concentrated on the interference, diffraction, polarization and refraction of light in different media under external influences. From there followed explorations in supersonic fluid mechanics. Mach and physicist-photographer Peter Salcher presented their paper on this subject in 1887; it correctly describes the sound effects observed during the supersonic motion of a projectile. They deduced and experimentally confirmed the existence of a shock wave of conical shape, with the projectile at the apex. The ratio of the speed of a fluid to the local speed of sound &quot;v&quot;p/&quot;v&quot;s is called the Mach number after him. It is a critical parameter in the description of high-speed fluid movement in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. Mach also contributed to cosmology the hypothesis known as Mach&#x27;s principle.

==Philosophy of science==

===Empirio-criticism===
From 1895 to 1901, Mach held a newly created chair for &quot;the history and philosophy of the inductive sciences&quot; at the University of Vienna. In his historico-philosophical studies, Mach developed a phenomenalistic philosophy of science that became influential in the 19th and 20th centuries. He originally saw scientific laws as summaries of experimental events, constructed for the purpose of making complex data comprehensible, but later emphasized mathematical functions as a more useful way to describe sensory appearances. Thus, scientific laws, while somewhat idealized, have more to do with describing sensations than with reality as it exists beyond sensations.

Mach&#x27;s positivism influenced many Russian Marxists, such as Alexander Bogdanov. In 1908, Lenin wrote a philosophical work, &quot;Materialism and Empirio-criticism&quot;, in which he criticized Machism and the views of &quot;Russian Machists&quot;. His main criticisms were that Mach&#x27;s philosophy led to solipsism and to the absurd conclusion that nature did not exist before humans:

Empirio-criticism is the term for the rigorously positivist and radically empiricist philosophy established by the German philosopher Richard Avenarius and further developed by Mach, Joseph Petzoldt, and others, that claims that all we can know is our sensations and that knowledge should be confined to pure experience.

In accordance with empirio-critical philosophy, Mach opposed Boltzmann and others who proposed an atomic theory of physics. Since one cannot observe things as small as atoms directly, and since no atomic model at the time was consistent, the atomic hypothesis seemed unwarranted to Mach, and perhaps not sufficiently &quot;economical&quot;. Mach had a direct influence on the Vienna Circle philosophers and logical positivism in general.

Several principles are attributed to Mach that distill his ideal of physical theorization, called &quot;Machian physics&quot;:
# It should be based entirely on directly observable phenomena (in line with his positivistic leanings)
# It should completely eschew absolute space and time in favour of relative motion
# Any phenomena that seem attributable to absolute space and time (e.g., inertia and centrifugal force) should instead be seen as emerging from the distribution of matter in the universe.

The last is singled out, particularly by Einstein, as &quot;the&quot; Mach&#x27;s principle. Einstein cited it as one of the three principles underlying general relativity. In 1930, he wrote, &quot;it is justified to consider Mach as the precursor of the general theory of relativity&quot; and that &quot;the whole direction of thought of this theory conforms with Mach&#x27;s...&quot; Einstein further reported that he had read David Hume and Mach&#x27;s work &quot;with eagerness and admiration shortly before finding relativity theory&quot; and that &quot;very possibly, I wouldn&#x27;t have come to the solution without those philosophical studies&quot;. Though Mach, before his death, apparently rejected Einstein&#x27;s theory. Einstein knew that his theories did not fulfill all Mach&#x27;s principles, and neither has any subsequent theory, despite considerable effort.

===Phenomenological constructivism===
According to Alexander Riegler, Mach&#x27;s work was a precursor to the influential perspective known as constructivism. Constructivism holds that all knowledge is constructed rather than received by the learner. He took an exceptionally non-dualist, phenomenological position. The founder of radical constructivism, Ernst von Glasersfeld, gave a nod to Mach as an ally.

 On the other hand, there is also a reasonable case for viewing Mach simply as an empiricist and a precursor of the logical empiricists and the Vienna Circle. On this view, the purpose of science is to detail functional relationships between observations: &quot;The goal which it (physical science) has set itself is the simplest and most economical abstract expression of facts.&quot;

===Influence===
Friedrich Hayek wrote that, when he attended the University of Vienna from 1918 to 1921, &quot;as far as philosophical discussion went it essentially revolved around Mach&#x27;s ideas&quot;. Mach&#x27;s work has also been cited as an influence on the Vienna Circle, being described as a &quot;major precursor of logical positivism&quot;. Members of the Circle organized the &quot;Ernst Mach Society&quot; as a vehicle for discussion of their ideas.

Mach&#x27;s work was a &quot;forerunner&quot; of Gestalt psychology.

==Physiology==
In 1873, independently of each other, Mach and the physiologist and physician Josef Breuer discovered how the sense of balance (i.e., the perception of the head&#x27;s imbalance) functions, tracing its management by information the brain receives from the movement of a fluid in the semicircular canals of the inner ear. That the sense of balance depends on the three semicircular canals was discovered in 1870 by the physiologist Friedrich Goltz, but Goltz did not discover how the balance-sensing apparatus functions. Mach devised a swivel chair to test his theories, and Floyd Ratliff has suggested that this experiment may have paved the way to Mach&#x27;s critique of a physical conception of absolute space and motion.

==Psychology==

In the area of sensory perception, psychologists remember Mach for the optical illusion called Mach bands. The effect exaggerates the contrast between edges of the slightly differing shades of gray as soon as they make contact, by triggering edge-detection in the human visual system.

More clearly than anyone before or since, Mach made the distinction between what he called &quot;physiological&quot; (specifically visual) and &quot;geometrical&quot; spaces.

Mach&#x27;s views on mediating structures inspired B. F. Skinner&#x27;s strongly inductive position, which paralleled Mach&#x27;s in the field of psychology.

==Eponyms==
